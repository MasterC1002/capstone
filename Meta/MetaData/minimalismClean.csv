It's depressing. It feels like lots of people in this sub consider themselves to be superior to others, and this manifests itself in a lack of humour, a lack of tact, and on occasion, downright rudeness. It strikes me that if you're *so minimalist* that other people's life choices cause you to respond negatively, you've probably missed the point.

Nobody should make changes in their life purely to fulfill an ideal. The whole point of making life changes is not so you can tick a box on a census form saying ""I'm a minimalist, look at me"", it's to improve the quality of your life, to allow you to enjoy life more. Minimalism is a great way of doing this, but if your end goal is to **be a minimalist** then I can't help but think you're doing it wrong. Your end goal should be to be happier, after all, isn't that really the only thing that matters in life?

This community should not be about mocking other people's understanding of minimalism, it should be about supporting one another in a quest to become happier people.

I don't really expect anything I say to change the way this sub operates, and I *do* enjoy reading most of the posts, but I felt I had to get this off my chest.

1346850289.0	ze319	Ok guys. I've got a serious question about these 'moving my stuff fits in two bags' posts. 	girlyawkward	690	114	218	"I feel like I really need some background info on you people. Minimalism is great and all, but are you people moving from your parents house for the first time or something?? 

All I know is that I have more dishes than I do anything else. Sure I could pack up my personal belongings, and make it fit into a couple bags... But I feel like these pictures are so unrealistic to someone who is just starting out. What about your furniture? Tv? Laptop? Grill? Fan? Kitchen table? And your bed?

So to me, the logic you are portraying here, is if you are a normal person, and have these things, then you don't 'fit' into the club. After all, it all needs to fit. 

I used to see people with bikes in the pictures, and boxes of stuff, that to me, looked like it could include the dishes. Maybe he's moving across country and wants to pick up furniture there.. 

Now I feel like it's a competition, see how many bags you can get away with leaving out of the picture before someone catches on.

Yep. Pretty sure this is going to be downvoted. Don't care.

Edit: Wow.. Things went better than expected... Did not get downvoted to hell. lol Thanks guys! Usually an adverse opinion gets shit on. Thanks for listening!"	t5_2r0z9	True

1369569610.0	1f2tfl	Avoid what is easy. How to find deep satisfaction in life.	minimalisto	540	74	102	"This hit me yesterday as I thought about how I spend my time.

I've recognized that I really enjoy reading on new topics, that I enjoy playing guitar, creating programs, and working out. 

I am also aware that I spend a lot of time just browsing reddit, watching television, and playing videogames. 

Something has always made me aware that video games, tv, etc. aren't what I should be doing with my time. I've finally realized what that is. 

Video games, TV, even reddit and other internet sites like YouTube seem to suck us all into them. They are easy. If you want to be entertained, feel some happiness, then just pick up the remote and tune in. 

However, they do not give any lasting satisfaction. You don't look back on last week and feel proud and happy that you watched a full season of Star Trek -- and even while you are watching, the amount of happiness you get is a steady trickle, but nothing great. 


Consider on the other hand, activities that take work, that aren't easy. Learning about a new subject can feel frustrating or confusing. A skill-based activity like playing the guitar can take months or years to get to a good point, and even then you are constantly trying to improve. 

Yet look back on a past week where you nailed a new song, learned a new skill, or had a new experience -- and suddenly there is pride and happiness and satisfaction. 

As minimalists we have said we will remove all garbage from our lives so that we can focus on what makes us happy and brings meaning to our lives -- yet so many of us are drawn to the low hanging fruit. 

I've seen many people on this subreddit say they spend their time playing video games, watching television, and browsing the internet. 

Have you ever wondered why so many people ask ""well if you don't watch TV what do you do?"" ""Aren't you bored?"" -- people who want to quit playing video games have to ask what they could possibly spend their time doing instead. 

What people are really searching for is the low hanging fruit. This easy steady drip of happiness. Their question is, if you remove television and other easy drips they know, what do you do instead? What drip have you discovered that they don't know about? 

I myself have struggled with this. I want to quit video games, yet looking online people give alternatives like ""going for a walk"", or ""wood working"". In my brain I say ""yeah okay, but what do you do that doesn't take so much work?"" -- I mean who really spends a whole day wood working or walking? They must fill the rest of their time somehow? Where is their easy drip? 

Now imagine for a second. What if there were no easy drips? No easy way to get a steady stream of happiness? What if all your happiness and satisfaction and meaning had to be worked for -- hard effort must be applied to everything you do before the happiness will arrive. 

You might sit on your ass all day and drink beer, talk with friends, but that is still just an easy drip. What if you remove that as well?

You will find that you will still seek happiness and especially a deep satisfaction with your life. And so you don't sit there blind waiting for something easy to show up, instead you start to work for it. 

You find these hobbies, activities that people have been telling you about all along, and you work at them until you have that deep satisfaction and every week can be looked back on with pride.

Each week you will achieve new accomplishments, have new experiences and feel a sense of pride. 

Eventually you get addicted to these bigger rushes of happiness, this deep sense of pride and satisfaction, and you simply will not be able to go back to the easy drip of television, video games, or other things.

-----

Addendum:

I think we experience this addiction to hard but satisfying activities on some level. 

You might spend most of your day in front of the television, but consistently go to the gym and have completed a strict strength training regime. 

You might be a runner, and go out every day running trying to reach that 10k or marathon level.

Ask these people, would they give up their hobby? A resolute NO! is what you will hear. 

I'm sure you have something in your life that you feel the same about.  It's the deep happiness and satisfaction you feel that makes you so protective over this hard hobby. 

We all have these addictions to activities which provide us with bigger flows of happiness, satisfaction, and pride. 

What I am suggesting is that if we can remove all of the easy drips of happiness, and truly focus all of our effort on these bigger flows, we can become addicted to more of these hard activites.

Picture whatever it is that grants you so much happiness right now, whatever hobby or activity that may be. 

Now imagine if every moment of your day was spent doing activities like it which granted you the same amount of satisfaction, happiness, and pride. 

Each day would hold 10x the amount of happiness, you would feel an extremely deep satisfaction that each day, week, month, and year were well spent. 

And to me, that sounds as minimalist as you can get. 

EDIT: I'm amazed at the response to this post. I'm glad most of you enjoyed and were inspired by what I had to say. I had to look twice when I had 25 orangered in my mailbox! I'll definitely consider writing some more in the future! "	t5_2r0z9	True

I spent so much time aimlessly scrolling through that site and complicating my social life between my friends and 'facebook friends'. I left my email and phone number for anyone who cares.

I hope to stick with this decision, as it will cut out that *extra* aspect in my social life. My real friends are the ones I actually talk to and share experiences (instead of duckface mirror shots) with. I'm looking forward to 2013, happy New Year /r/minimalism!

Edit: Wow thanks for all of the feedback! It has been interesting reading others stories and points of view on the subject. I can't really respond to some of the comments because I've only been off Facebook for a day. Here are some main points I've contemplated.

* I don't expect to be 'cured' of any personal problems by deactivating my Facebook. I do, however, see it as a step to simplifying my life *and that's why I shared it on this subreddit*
* Good for you if you can manage Facebook and still have a happy social life. It shouldn't be so hard for me to do the same, but it is.

1356838029.0	15nmo0	My mother was a hoarder. She lived in the house for 30 years before I moved in. This is the story of our recovery to cleanliness and simplicity.	catsmakegreatpillows	482	72	96	" My mom is my best friend, a brilliant student, a gifted psych nurse, and an incredible sweet beautiful person, but good grief the house. She's healthy, smart, kind, and funny, but oh god the house. Words fail. It's on a half acre of trees and her hoarding covered the whole lot. inside and out. The city sent blight notices and threats of fines and things were escalating.

She was always what we would call, ""cluttery"" - picking up things like golf balls, pretty glass, or unusual stones on a walk. But she also took my great-grandmother's lessons from the Depression and her own youth in poverty to heart - so she hoarded rubber bands, prescription bags, envelopes, paper (Oh god the paper), etc. She was a psychiatric nurse specializing in pediatrics, she is a literacy tutor, self-taught mystic and botanist, and origami teacher - so there was paper, thousands of books, bag after bag of toys of all kinds, medical texts, everything you could possibly imagine. She loved to shop at Goodwill and yard sales when she was lonely, bringing home stray furniture, clothes, toys, and always stacks of books. Ten years ago my dad died and in her grief things got much worse. It took years for her to recover, and eventually she bought a little house in the woods to retire to. 

My mom moved to a small hippie community in the woods and once there her social group grew, she became more active and healthy, her heart began to heal, and she stopped her compulsive buying. Once she was secure there she gave me permission to clean up the house. She said she wanted to clean up but was totally overwhelmed and didn't even know where or how to start.

When I moved in two years ago, each room had a corridor through the six foot high collections and trash through which you could navigate very carefully. The lights were out, the wallboard unfinished, the house stank of cat and dog urine. The yard was incredible, the trees overgrown, the house was in ruins.

My boyfriend and I have worked so hard the last couple years. I started outside so the city would get off my back. I mulched the yard in two feet of wood mulch to smother the grass, went crazy with my saber saw on the trees, and my boyfriend and I did dozens of dump loads in his truck. We divided the yard into sections and just started throwing away everything that wasn't essential. I built a big cinderblock firepit and we had burns every weekend for the heaps of wood and paper. That took most of the first year. We lived in the back room sleeping on top of the spa on a mattress, no other room was liveable. 

Then I started in the house. I set a goal of one room per month, but had to scale back to two rooms per season because the city limited what I could put out for trash at one time and sent me letters if I put the trash in my driveway in between pickups. Local scrappers took furniture and metal. The school up the road got boxes of books, paper, and art supplies. The firepit and garbage and recycling bin got more than I will ever admit. 

I put in place a couple of rules:
1. If it doesn't get used in six months, it's gone. 
2. No furniture unless it's quality, and only if needed. 
3. I have to be able to keep up the house by myself- so the simpler the better. 
4. No upgrades- just stripping away, repairs, and cleaning. (preventing Money Pit Syndrome.) Drywall is being built, fences, bright new lights, new paint - room by room I'm fixing it up, simplifying, baring down to something simple and clean. The yard is better and better, the house has beautiful bones and is so bright and pretty now. It's still an old house, but it's a sane house finally.

My mom comes to visit a few times a year and is so thankful to me. I don't have to pay rent. :) I just keep cleaning and simplifying the house, throwing things away and cleaning and painting as I go. She has a house now, we have a working hot tub, a woodshop, a metal shop, a little forge and garden, the animals are clean and healthy, the yard looks great, we can have guests over, and I can keep up with it. There's still a lot to do, I have a five year plan. My goal is to be able to rent or sell the property if I want to move. The way it was it might have been scraped or condemned and it's a beautiful old house.

I'm writing this because I just kind of finished - I cleaned out my mom's room yesterday. It took seventeen trash bags. I've never seen her room look like this in my life. This was the last room of The Crazy, and I fought to keep her photos and tchotchkes preserved while stripping and cleaning it. When she comes in a few days it will be my surprise to her - her personal space is big, bright, clean and liveable now. I can't wait to see her face.

Minimalism isn't just a philosophy to me - it'a love letter to my mom, a renewal of a valuable material resource, a battle against my mom's grief and loneliness, and  part of my mission to better myself and my family so we can have a good future. We're winning with every room cleaned and emptied. One of the rooms is our own bright clean little bedroom now.  :)

You don't need to buy anything to help you be minimal. Don't throw out a bed and buy a futon to be more minimal. Don't buy a new ""minimalistic"" wallet because your old one suddenly won't do anymore. Don't buy a set of identical clothing and throw out perfectly good ones. Trim down what you have. Wait till something breaks before you replace it with your minimalistic ideal replacement.

It is arguable if this still counts as minimalism, but one thing is for sure: this is **dangerous**. I'm not trying to dictate what you should or shouldn't do, but please try not to push minimalism to such extremes that it'd put yourself (or others) in physical or mental danger.   
Minimalism is a very opinionated thing, it can be whatever you'd like it to be, but let's keep possession-wars out, and please, **be safe**."	t5_2r0z9	True

3. “If you want to be given everything, give everything up.”

4. “If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.”

5. “When there is no desire, all things are at peace.”

6. “Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are.
 When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.”

7. “In the pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added.
 In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped.”

8. “The Master’s power is like this.
 He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire.
 He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed.
 He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.”

 These three are your greatest treasures.”

10. “The Master has no possessions.
 The more he does for others, the happier he is.

1350909872.0	11w5gz	How to politely reject gifts?	Rekreativc	367	72	410	"Here is the thing: I like living simply and I don't connect to the consumer mentality at all. I hate clutter even more. My SO (with whom I live) luckily agrees with me, however she is one of few people who do.

I (we) have a lot of friends (and family...) who like spending (my SO and I are quite frugal even though we make a good living and don't need to watch our money) on stupid things and I'm not trying to change them - if it makes them happy (or whatever), more power too them.

However I really hate it when we're given gifts. Now I appreciate the thought, but many of items our friends buy are clearly in the ""it's only X€, why not? It ill be a great laugh!"" category. Examples would be silly hats and such, potted flowers, etc.

The thing is that after the gift is received one can never get rid of it without offending the gift-giver. The stupid crap just stays with you for ever and ever and I'd really like to put an end to it.

I've tried talking to those who do this more often and it never ends well. It usually leads down the ""if you're cheap it doesn't mean I have to be"" path, just hurting the friendship while changing nothing. I've even tried to convince them that if they insist on buying something stupid, it should be a consumable so we can enjoy it together and then forget about it. It didn't help, they just don't understand...

So, fellow redditors, how do you politely turn down gifts?"	t5_2r0z9	True

Here is my room!  http://imgur.com/a/khrrb

I am a 25 year old career female.  I'm not a student.  I'm not male and I have a fair amount of expendable cash to buy higher quality items.  I also have an affinity(or I like to think I do) for nice looking spaces, contemporary design and high quality items.

I understand that minimalism is different for everyone so we don't need to flood this thread with that kind of talk.  I hope you enjoy my take on it!  I love the idea of extreme minimalism, but I also like to indulge in things that would normally not fit within that mindset(like a couple of bottles of nail polish and a Biore pore strips. XD

Though I think the pics don't do it justice, I don't keep a lot of superfluous things around.  That canvas holder on the back of my closet door looks kind of packed, but there are really just bare essentials(in my mind) like extra razors, condoms, tape, a reusable produce bag, etc.

I know that might still be difficult to put together(how do you fill a canvas organizer with all that crap?  So I've pulled out all of my make up to show you guys what I have...so for a city girl who likes to wear make up and go out I think this make up bag is pretty minimalistic! :D

http://imgur.com/3GswS

I'd also like to point out that I'm the kind of girl who loves clothes and love to have a varied wardrobe hence the perhaps lack of minimalism in my clothing.  It is something that I prefer to have more of than less though I appreciate people who can have 30 items of clothing in their closet.

Edit: Thank you for the down vote. And even though my post is now going to be lost in the depths of reddit hell, I hope that someone looking for a subreddit like this may stumble across it. 

Edit 2: Thanks to those upvoting. It means a lot to me and I hope to read about something you've done to give yourself a breath of fresh air on /r/freshstart!"	t5_2r0z9	True

""I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and threw them out the window in disgust.""

It kind of sums up my reasoning for trying to live a minimalist life. So much BS that we already have to deal with, the last thing I need is frivolous possessions wasting more of my time.

I think that's why you'll often read ""that's not what minimalism is"" in this subreddit. Not because we don't recognize someone's photo or words as minimal, but because we don't recognize their motivations.

I like experimenting with asceticism, because when I cross a line I though I couldn't cross, it gives me a feeling of lightness and accomplishment. I like to occasionally go outside of my comfort zone. No scratch that. I *need* to occasionally go out if my comfort zone. When I don't, I'll lie awake at night thinking about what to get rid of next. 

A person who just gets rid of the superfluous stuff in his house and limits future accumulation can also call himself a minimalist. Going outside of his comfort zone might not ever be necessary or desirable to him. 

I might be addicted to the feeling I get when I toss something, that little jolt of fear followed by relief. I might simplify to compensate for the feeling that the world is complicated and difficult to grasp. The other guy might just want more time and space for the things and the people he loves. 

What ever our reasons, I would love it if we could nurture our differences rather than try to squash them or to split into new, more specific subreddits. "	t5_2r0z9	True

So basically a few months ago I had a few days off work. And with some shitty weather, I spent the majority of my time indoors cleaning my house and trying to find some way of organising all my shit. But I got super stressed with it all and one day I just thought ""Why do I have all this? This crap is useless!""
So after many donations and weeks and weeks of selling the more valuable items on eBay etc. I can truly say I am comfortable with my very few possessions. 
It has now got to the stage where I could literally move away with all my possessions in one suitcase (except my bike), and that makes me extremely happy and strangely calm and stress free. 
By keeping what I deem to be essentials for my own lifestyle, I have changed every aspect of my daily routine and most of all my former careless spending. Both my finances and mental health are in full working order and I would urge most people to try it.

I'm 38. I have 2 kids, a mortgage and a career so I'm not coming into this for mobility purposes. I'm pretty well cemented where I sit. 

Over the past year I have sold all 800 of my LPs and 45s, 300 or so books save for my favorite authors (Vonnegut, Murakami, Brautigan), 200 DVDs/Blu Rays, 4 guitars, and countless pieces of vintage hi-fi equipment. I now have all my music on a mac mini hooked up to a receiver. 

During this whole process, my wife has been bitten by the bug. Over the past 2 weeks we have cleaned out both of the kid's rooms (age 3 &amp; 6) and donated a total of 40 kitchen sized trash bags full of clothes, toys, and other useless crap. 

Just today we cleaned out the kitchen and got rid of two large rubbermaid totes worth of stuff - extra glasses, silverware, pans, dishes, appliances, etc.

We've never been hoarders, but we have been bored shoppers. I make pretty good money and my wife stays home with the kids, so whenever we got bored we would buy something. We started to realize that all of this stuff was taking over our lives, our house, and our bank account. We began to realize that our kids did not appreciate gifts, new toys, etc and were always looking for their next fix. I could buy my son a new DS game and he'd be wanting another on two days later. Granted, he's six…but still.

4 weeks ago we turned the TV off and have only turned it on about an hour or two a day - mostly when I'm at work. All of the commercials were getting to me and I started to resent how they worked their magic on my kids. Even though I'm missing out on some shows I enjoy, I have never made a better decision. I've noticed that since I stopped watching TV, I no longer want things - whether it be fast food, a gadget, or whatever else they're hocking. Outside of gas, bills, and the few times I've brought pizza home for dinner, I've not spent a single dime in a month. I take that back. I bought a bag of apple candy.

My goal isn't to get down to barely nothing. My goal is to get down to only what is needed and, when possible, not to buy a piece of shit that will last a year or so and fall apart. A good example is my search for a good checkerboard and checkers. We've been playing more games since we turned the TV off (dominoes being our favorite) and I've been wanting to teach the kids to play checkers. I went to Walmart last week and they had a set for like $5 but it was a huge piece of plastic shit and I just found myself getting disgusted by it. I got on etsy and ebay and found oldschool sets that were built to last and now I'm just waiting on the mailman.

I can walk into my kitchen, my living room, my bedroom (still working on that), and my kids rooms now and not feel like I have failed them. We were worried at first that giving the kids an ultimatum of only keeping what would fit in one cedar chest would make them resentful or bored - that they would feel bad when they went to a friend's house and saw that they had so many more toys than them. But then we realized, this was simply social conditioning. Years of TV have made us think that was the norm and IT'S NOT. I'm happy to say that my 6 year old really got into the joy of giving his toys to kids who may not have any. My daughter's too young to understand but she never got upset either.

Our 2600 sq ft house is starting to feel a bit bare and I'm loving it. It just makes me want to move to a smaller house and save more money on utilities, etc. 

I've rambled. I apologize. 

**TL;DR** turned off the tv, sold a lot of shit, much happier, hi."	t5_2r0z9	True

**DON'T try to go through all of these at once, or even in my exact order. Bookmark this thread; make your way through it slowly. Don't get a stomachache.** This is a compression of literally YEARS of discovery on my part. If you find something that excites you, something that makes you go ""HOLY SHIT!!"", then **stop listening** and stick to your new exciting discovery.

Minimalist music emphasizes aspects of music which are often left to the background: rhythm and texture are paramount, sometimes replacing melody entirely! The result can be beautiful, accessible sometimes but other times extremely challenging. It can either send your mind to a calm, relaxed place, or it can lay out a difficult path that leads your mind to beautiful things.

Minimalist music started out as a classical movement, but it's important to note that since the 60s, it's been incorporated into genres of popular music. Electronic music owes a huuuuuuge debt to minimalism, as does Billboard Top 40s pop – surprised? Don't be. The emphasis on danceable rhythms and on highly-produced texture may not lead to minimalist pop (ha!) but it's partially rooted in that movement. In fact, I found that liking minimalist music led to my _loving_ modern pop music! I used to think that modern songwriters were just less talented and elegant than the old ones. Then I realized they were just writing songs to entirely different rules, and that minimalism was what helped discover many of those rules in the first place.

Anyway, let's get started!

**Easy Listening**

Instead of sticking to historical progression, I'm just going to move from the easier-to-get-into stuff up to the more difficult (and more rewarding) minimalist stuff. The earlier stuff makes me dance, in other words, and the later stuff I sit and focus on.

Let's start with one of the most immediately gorgeous pieces ever written, shall we?

[Steve Reich – Music for 18 Musicians](http://grooveshark.com/s/Music+For+18+Musicians/2Vx9Bc?src=5). This piece is like the music of the spheres to me: subtle, beautiful, and slowly shifting. It's broken up into 11 sections, plus an opening and closing ""pulse"", but I picked a track which would play the whole thing instead of making you click for each movement. Every section is built around a single chord, and for several minutes plays with rhythmic variations on that chord. What makes it work is the texture of the musicians Reich assembled, who combined sound just otherworldly. 

[Ludovico Einaudi – Stella del mattino](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKwQ2gBRc0). Einaudi doesn't like being called a minimalist, but his music absolutely leans in that direction. Beautiful, spare piano patterns that repeat to build emotion. It's much simpler than classical piano composition, but lovely nonetheless.

[The xx – Crystalized](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pib8eYDSFEI). A recent pop group that writes songs about as stripped down as they get. It's catchy, but much slower and starker than pop usually gets. The emphasis is on precision – precise vocal delivery, precise music lines – that gives you exactly what you need and no more.

Time for another one of the minimalist greats:

[Terry Riley – In C](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjR4QYsa9nE). Riley was one of the earliest minimalists. In C was his response to classical music that was too cluttered, unwelcoming, and intimidating. The secret to In C is that the _musicians_ are in control of it: look at the [score](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tkm9v4opNG8/SxN7-mizljI/AAAAAAAADNI/uhvaeoUD0vY/s1600/Terry+Riley+In+C+full+score.jpg). It's composed of little snippet-pieces that any performer can choose to play at any time. The result is a piece that's rhythmic and fun to listen to, but that changes literally every time it's played. You can play it with any number and combination of instruments – check out [this MetaFilter post](http://www.metafilter.com/79702/Oh-Say-Can-You-See-The-Way-I-Play-In-C) to hear it played by French guitarists, a Chinese orchestra, a voice-and-percussion group, and so many more.

[Brian Eno – St. Elmo's Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3djUYgebU). Eno is ENORMOUS, even if you've never heard of him before. The guy was in Roxy Music, one of the first glam rock bands; he invented an entire genre of music (we'll get to that later); and he's produced music by U2, David Bowie, Talking Heads, and Coldplay, among countless others. St. Elmo's Fire is from an album in which Eno was moving away from loud, violent rock and towards something quieter and textural. Despite its minimalist leanings, it has IMHO one of the greatest guitar solos of all time, courtesy of the amazing Robert Fripp.

[The Velvet Underground – All Tomorrow's Parties](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3djUYgebU). The Velvet Underground were maybe the most minimalist-influenced rock outfit of the 1960s. John Cale, one of its founding members, studied and worked with the original minimalist composer, La Monte Young (on whom more later – he's difficult). TVU wrote some shocking rock music, and one of their oft-repeated tactics was to use dense, interesting patterns, like All Tomorrow's Parties drum-and-piano combo. 

**Interlude**

We're about to get into something considerably more difficult, so as a transition I want to include a few pieces, some short and some long, by a modern cello composer that I think highlights the potential and beauty of minimalist music. One of his pieces is quite known; the rest are sadly not; but they are all fantastic.

[Giovanni Sollima – Terra Aria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldPf3yqq3-8). This one's semi-famous music video illustrates the nature of its minimalist composition. Lasse Gjertsen filmed Sollima playing each of its parts on a single cello, and combined them into a single video so you could see the rhythms of the piece on one instrument.

[Giovanni Sollima – Trio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X5omVuKDBQ). A quiet, relaxed piece. I think of it as a love song. Both these pieces are wonderful, but I think Sollima's real gift is his longer work. For instance:

[Giovanni Sollima – Violoncelles, Vibrez!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=628Ps5pc6_Y). Rhythms that start slow and grow faster and more thrilling as they go. Patterns that constrict tighter and tighter, that squeeze out something truly exciting.

[Giovanni Sollima – Concerto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhKSIJw7Gzk). The first movement in a four-part composition. This and the last piece come from an album called We Were Trees, and this composition feels fresh and green and outdoors to me. Sollima isn't a strict minimalist, but to me he's evidence of what an attention to sparse texture and rhythm can bloom into; he supports uplifting melodies with patterns that allow those melodies freedom to roam.

1335274951.0	spxf9	I made a discovery this week.	sonic-servant	196	27	51	"I made a discovery this week: I discovered laundry services. I dropped off a bag full of dirty laundry at the cleaners last night, and this morning I picked up clean, dry clothes. Not only were they clean and dry, they were folded while they were hot (which has about the same effect as ironing). Furthermore, my khakis, which previously had bike grease on the right pant leg, were spotless. My white shirt had clearly been bleached (I only have one, so I usually toss it in with the colored clothes and it comes out a little grey).

Normally doing my laundry costs $3 just to use the washer and dryer, and *not* counting the cost of detergent. I don't fold my clothes immediately, so if I want unwrinkled clothes (rare) I have to iron them myself. I certainly don't do whatever it is they did to get the spots out of my pants; I don't know how. I saved *at least* an hour, and if you count the fact that hour would be split up between multiple trips to the laundry room, it's about half of a weeknight. And it only cost me $8. For $5 I got half a weeknight back.

I'm posting this here because, for me, minimalism is about taking my life back from my possessions. It has helped that I have minimized my clothes down to one load of laundry, but until this week, I hadn't figured out a way to take back any more time from my clothes; they are possessions I can't get rid of completely and which require frequent maintenance. However, by outsourcing that maintenance, I've been able to minimize their impact on my life. What's more, the people I give my laundry to do a better job on my laundry than I ever did.

If you don't buy that argument, consider this: I am going to be dropping my iron and ironing board off at the thrift store later today. Maybe it doesn't count to get rid of consumables, but I've already given away my laundry detergent to my roommate."	t5_2r0z9	True

TL;DR - /r/minimalism will remain a catchall for all different types of minimalism. However, in the coming weeks I'll think about implementing the following adjustments:

- Changing the sidebar to put more emphasis on the more specific subreddits. E.g. minimalist art

- Perhaps more strictly enforcing post tagging, and maybe looking into a way of showing these tags as icons in the post names

- Arranging some sort of 'image day' where people post pictures of their living spaces on one specific day only

- More strict moderation with regards to people saying 'This isn't minimalism!' when we're all aware that minimalism is somewhat subjective

I am a natural minimalist. However, I'm also full of nervous energy and sometimes the compulsion to cut down and make taught the items in my life rules me. 

But, Minimalism is the *reduction* of items, not its *elimination*. Minimalism is a *type* of Materialism, not it's absence. 

And sometimes we become too preoccupied with the method that was intended to make life simpler.

The philosophy of the English gentleman was that his gadgets, his items, were to all be used in moderation. Materials never owned a true gentleman; he knew that if fortune would strip it from him he would still maintain his poise, but that his items were never to furnish him spiritually—they simply expedited the duties of life, only.

Minimalism diminishes so that the power of character can shine. Don’t forget that. The posts here, in true tone, should be about the benefits of minimalism, and not always their acts.

You'd be surprised at how many of the things you own don't pass the test. It's most effective when used in conjunction with the 3 month rule for items the latter doesn't necessarily apply to. For example things that don't really have an intended ""use"" and are purely aesthetic, like a statuette or a wall hanging. 

Some things you own get used often but only because you happen to have them, not because you need them. I had dresser that I kept pants and shorts in. Of course I used it all the time, but I didn't really need it as there was plenty of room on the shelves inside my closet to store pants. I surmised that had in seen it for sale at a thrift store with a $5 price tag I would have passed as it wasn't all that pleasing to the eye and I didn't have any need for the extra storage. 

This is the rule that I've found the most effective in my pursuit of minimalism. Hoping it can serve the reddit minimalists as well as it has served me. Cheers."	t5_2r0z9	True

Over the last ~10 years I have transitioned several living arrangements with the largest being a 1120sq foot house I bought and the smallest being my currently rented 300ish sq ft room.

Regardless of the living situation, I haven't noticed much of a difference in free time or money as I've always felt I had/have plenty of both (maybe because all of my situations were relatively minimal?). I did notice that stuff just feels like a burden to me and owning it is bothersome for some reason.

So that's it for me, I live with minimal possessions simply because they feel like a burden to me. There's no grand plan of backpacking Europe, enjoying copious free time, saving money, or any of the other common reasons for minimalism I always read about.

So, who else is minimalist because it just feels right? No well defined reason or goal...it's just how I enjoy living."	t5_2r0z9	True

Does getting rid of things actually have anything to do with it?

I mean, why get rid of things in the first place?  To achieve a more peaceful state of mind.  Owning fewer things is merely a means to an end.  The end itself is peace of mind.  Why not just go for the ""end"" directly?  Stare at that giant pile of stuff you have, and experiment with being at peace while it's there.  After all, it's not:

possession---&gt;unhappiness

but rather:

possession---&gt;your reaction---&gt;unhappiness

Yes, this could also be a very tangled defense for hoarding, but even if it is, there could still be truth there.  Thoughts?

My obsession is the fear that everything around me will break and I will not have the money to replace it. I rarely have 5 consecutive minutes where I don't panic about this. I'm utterly convinced that my computer, television, phone, tools, musical instruments, etc are going to spontaneously fall apart to a point of being irreparable, and it will be my fault for not taking care of them.

My compulsions vary wildly. On good days I'll only have to touch the thing I think is about to break with my hands. Sometimes I'll dust it off, or turn it off and turn it back on. On bad days I cope by chewing my fingers until they bleed and rocking back and forth.

Striving towards a minimalistic lifestyle has helped me deal with this. I'm a long ways off from being able to live without the stress of my condition, and I'll probably have to seek professional help again at some point, but this subreddit and other resources have helped me learn that I am more than my material possessions. It is true that my livelihood depends on my ability to write music with a computer, and my ability to play music on my various instruments, but I am still more than that. All that is essential to my survival is my body. If everything breaks, it won't matter. I will still be me and I will be just fine.

The original packing freaked me out a little, as I saw everything we owned being collected and stacked in boxes and those boxes slowly choke out all the floor space. 

At the same time, this was a little liberating as I had the chance to down size and to live simply. I gathered my important belongings in my backpack and lived out of that for a week. 

When we finally move in, there is a lot of work to be done, the previous tenants hadn't cleaned and the walls were in desperate need of a colour change. The city of boxes was mostly relegated to my new office as we started in on all of it. 

Here we are, more than three weeks moved and the boxes start to come down. My mrs is unpacking everything on her days off while I'm at work.  Every evening, when I walk in exhausted, there is more shit everywhere. I'm talking ugly amber glass vases, tiny floral printed oriental fans on the walls, so many tea lights and associated glass holders that they choke space out. My life is cluttered again and she calls it cozy. 

It's to the point where I can't be in the living room anymore. I almost don't want to be in the house. The entire reason we got the place was so that it would be less cluttered, but she seems to be acquiring more shit to fill it.

Thanks for letting me vent.

Symptoms are: Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance. Body checking.
Self-mutilation.

Minimalism drastically helped me to fight anxiety.

And in my case, it goes way beyond just getting rid of objects
and having a clean room.

**BELONGINGS**

2 years ago, I gave all my belongings to a family in the need.
Bed, oven, tables, dish washer, TV, phones, consoles, DVDs,
computers, … I gave everything, except some cloths, a computer,
and a mobile phone. I made sure that all the things I owned would
fit in only one bag. I've learned later that this way of living
is called **Minimalism**.

I own 15 ""things"". This is how I count them:

* Cloths (2 pants, enough tshirts and under-wears for a week)
* Toilet bag (shaver, tooth brush, …)
* A jacket
* 2 computers (for work)
* 2 phones (for work)
* Headphones
* A watch
* A passport
* Wallet with 3 cards and cash
* A Nintendo 3DS
* A Kindle
* A V60 (coffee dripper)
* A backpack

I love being able to count the things I own. For some reasons,
it makes me feel better. The less things I own,
the less things I need to worry about.

**NO HOME &amp; TRAVELING**

I don't have what most of the people refer as a ""home"".
I rent furnished apartments (mostly on Airbnb lately).

I'm lucky enough to have a job that lets me work remotely (not from
an office). I can work from home, from coworking spaces or from coffee shops.
So I started moving a lot. Jumping from an apartment to another.
I think the longest I stayed in a city was in Berlin for 6 months (I'm French).

I stopped watching TV and started meeting people from different cultures.
I have been to most of the European countries. To America. To Asia.

As I'm writing this, I'm in Taiwan for 2 months. I don't have apartment in Europe
to worry about.

This feeling of having just one bag and being able to jump, anytime,
from a city to another, is great. I have no idea where I'll be in 2 months.

**DISCONNECTING**

Same thing goes with ""connections"". I like to be able to count the
number of entities (public administrations) that know about me.

* My employer
* Taxes administration
* My bank
* French social security
* Mobile broadband company

If my *official address* changes, these people are the only one I need to
notify. I say *official address* because I move so often I needed to use
my parent's as a proxy.

I'm actually annoyed by the fact the you're supposed to have a ""home"".
I guess for legal reasons you just can't avoid that.
Also, if I could, I'd get rid of my phone number, but it's impossible (bank needs one).

**BENEFITS**

**Freedom**. Feeling *self contained*. When I picture myself, I see a man
with a bag filled with 15 things, and 5 ""strings"" connecting him to
""administrations"". And that makes me feel a little more serene.

**Time**. That is that most surprising thing, Time goes slower since I'm
jumping from a city to another. So many things happen in my life during
these 2 years, that my whole life feels to go much slower. I think we can
explain that easily. The more you experiment, the more memories you have.
The more memories you have, the more you perceive time.

Maybe you have recommendations about what could be my next steps. What I could improve.
Maybe you have some questions for me. I could talk more about how I manage my money. How friendship is hard (when moving so often). What exactly my anxiety problems are. How I plan my future life. How I apprehend work."	t5_2r0z9	True

When I first started thinking seriously about what I bought and owned I figured my relatives would love not having to buy me things as much. In retrospect I've come to see that most people still want to buy 'something'.

Over the years I've tried different approaches, food is always a good suggestion but not everyone likes that idea. Gift cards and cash are the same, it doesn't really have meaning - gets old quickly. Experiences are a fun idea but people don't always have the budget to extend to something like that or are near enough to share it with you like you'd prefer.

So r/minimalism, what are you experiences giving and receiving? Obviously I'm posting this at Christmas but I guess it's just as relevant for birthdays etc. What ideas have you given people who've asked what they can get you?

But even with my smallish purse I still felt weighed down (and not just physically). I didn't like having to keep up with my purse.  I carried things that I felt like I needed but that I rarely, if ever used. 

A few months ago I decided to stop carrying a purse. I almost exclusively wear jeans, so I have pockets to put stuff in. 

I dumped out my purse and all the contents of my wallet and I asked myself what do I actually *need* on a day-to-day basis? Money, ID, keys, and phone. I ended up using a tiny binder clip as a makeshift money clip for my debit card, student ID, and driver's license. I'll be the first to admit that this isn't the best solution but it's a lot better than my old traditional wallet. My keys are on a carabiner with no extra keychains and it hooks to one of my back belt loops.

I love the freedom of not carrying a purse! So far I haven't once missed my purse or the extra things in it. Well that's a half-lie. The only times I've missed my purse and went back to it have been when I'm on my period. Carrying extra tampons in your pocket is awkward as fuck."	t5_2r0z9	True
1365089906.0	1bnzf3	Forced into a minimalist lifestyle by circumstances, but staying because I like it.	spritesprite8	158	23	37	"I've been thinking of posting here for a while now, because I think you may appreciate my story.

I remember standing with my mother in her kitchen about ten years ago and looking at all the tchotchkes she had amassed over 59 years.  I said, having been raised in our blunt but loving family, ""Mom, why don't you cull through these things and simplify your kitchen?""  

She scoffed, ""Nope.  Not gonna happen.""  

""But, Mom... You realize that *I'M* the one who will have to go through this mess when you die someday.""

""Yep.  Oh, well.  Just know that I loved and cherished each and every one of these things.""

She died in 2007.  And not one item in that kitchen has been moved since.

Fast forward two years to 2009:  My husband and I decided to move our family to our favorite place, Florida.  Since my mother didn't get to retire, we embraced life in the now and started packing up for our ""retirement destination"" to enjoy while we are still young and alive.

As we started packing and culling through the accumulation of ten years of marriage and two young kids in a 3,000+ sqft house, my instinct was to keep it all.  My husband took the stance of, ""Do we really need it in Florida?""  Every time I picked up a paper mâché owl from 6th grade or a piece of scribble art from my 2-year-old, I'd cringe at the thought of throwing them away.  We compromised by taking pictures of all the artwork, of me holding or wearing sentimental items like trophies or sweaters.  We digitally captured box after box of memorabilia.  My consolation was that if I was ever sentimental, I could pull up my pictures and reminisce.  

I have never looked at those pictures.  Ever.

We sold or gave away every piece of furniture, save a baker's rack, a breakfront cabinet from my aunt, and a little side table that was my grandmother's.  We then moved into a furnished, two bedroom, 900 sqft condo in Florida, and we were STILL surrounded by boxes and boxes of STUFF.

We finally bought a 3-bedroom, 1600 sqft house after a little over a year.  We had sparse decorations, mostly of simplistic beach landscapes.  I never put up one family picture.  I wanted our house to be a haven from the loudness of the world and to reflect the serenity of a simple lifestyle.  It was at this point that I realized how we were minimalizing other aspects of our lives, such as our bills.  We cut out cable and DISH TV, cut Netflix to streaming only, and worked hard on using natural light instead of electricity to light the house during the day. I also didn't mind the humidity and heat of the summer so much, so I turned off the A/C quite often and opened the windows.

Due to a new job, we sold the house in October and moved into a 900 sqft, 2-bedroom apartment again.  (More bills were eliminated with our house sale, such as paying off our cars, which we plan on using until they are run into the ground!)  And although I feel like we got rid of almost everything again like our first move, including my grandmother's side table and aunt's breakfront, I realized that this time, we aren't living among walls of boxes.  Then it occurred to me why that is--- all our boxes and stuff is in storage, waiting for us to buy our new house in July.  Ugh.

Now I'm almost depressed, thinking about opening that POD filled to the brim with STUFF. Granted, some of it we have missed and really will need-- but I realize that we have lived for months without our huge wardrobe of clothing, extra shoes, books, kitchen items, and who knows what else I've forgotten we even own!  I feel like I'm gearing up to tackle a tidal wave of crap.

Right now, my entire family is living with minimal clothing (just a few shirts, pants, shorts, shoes each), minimal kitchen supplies (god, I miss our grill and smoker, though), minimal bath supplies, even ""one set of toys"" for each kid (Legos for one and Imaginext for the other).  It's almost like living out of a suitcase at a hotel.  And we've been doing it for months now, and we are just fine.

So, when we get our new house, I'm thinking I will have to resort to a dumpster next to the POD as I unpack it.  My mother was, for all intents and purposes, a hoarder.  I've come so far from these moves, and I've thankfully prevented myself from falling into that hoarding lifestyle.  I want to keep on pursuing the minimalist lifestyle, even though I've been sort of forced into it by necessity with each move.  It has freed our family to have more space, more peace, more money, and more dedication to doing things rather than accumulating things.

Has anyone else been forced to minimalize, only to embrace and love it more than you thought you would?

* I walk to work (7 minute walk)
* I work early, so I get off work early.
* I don't own a car (work provides a bus-pass)
* I don't own a laptop (work provides a laptop)
* I run on my lunch break
* I'm splitting rent and my room mate is very clean
* I'm saving money like a mad man

But now I'm bored. I'm used to keeping busy with school &amp; work, so now I don't know what to do with my time. I have lots of hobbies, but for some reason I don't feel like doing any of them except for playing video games with my friends online. I'm into photography, guitar/vocals, recording, running, double-edge razor shaving, and a few others - but I'm not keeping up with my hobbies, despite all my free time.  

One thing that I've been trying recently is saying ""Yes"" to everything I can and it's helping a little bit. Also, I recently moved so part of the problem could be having less friends and missing my parents and dog.   

Anyway, what do you guys &amp; gals do with your spare time? Has anyone else run across this ridiculous first-world problem?

**tl;dr:  I think I'm too efficient, now I have too much time.**

**Edit:** I found another post here on /r/minimalism that had some really insightful comments. If anyone has anything to add that might be more specific to my situation, I'd really appreciate it :)

1343710196.0	xfmbx	A test for minimalists	rimcrimp	158	25	30	"Minimalism means different things to different people, but for those of you who are interested purely from the perspective of eliminating stuff, I came up with an exercise that you should try (while watching an episode of Hoarders I might add).

* Get a piece of paper and a writing implement.

* Go outside.

* Make a list of **all** the objects that are important to you (from memory) -- table, computer, charger, silverware, etc..

* Go back inside and make a new list of all of the things you couldn't remember off the top of your head (nothing from the old list should go on the new list).

* Now look at the new list and ask yourself, ""do I really need everything on this list?""

The rationale, of course, being that if you can't even remember that you own it, how important can it be? This idea stems from my parents who have so much junk piled up in their basement that they don't even know most of what they own. When they need something, there's a high chance that they won't know whether or not they already own it, so they'll go out and buy it again (like a hammer or something).

Now I'm not suggesting that you throw everything away on the list of things you couldn't remember (that's up to you), but this exercise may help you recognize some things that don't really matter and that you can do without.

It was mostly winter stuff but had a lot of my dresses and shoes in there as well. As a girl (maybe that part doesn't even matter) I had put together a fairly large collection of clothes. 

So yesterday I went to his house to gather the rest of my belongings and I could not for the life of me find these boxes of clothing. Eventually I find that my dad had recently had loads of stuff picked up for charity and my boxes went with the rest of the stuff. At first I was angry and immediately began to think of how to rebuild my wardrobe. On the car ride home I began to think of what it was I had actually lost. I lost some sweat shirts, I lost some dresses I really only wear once or twice a year. There were a pair of shoes my dog had chewed over a year ago I had kept telling myself I would get fixed but never got around to doing so. There were clothes from high school I kept telling myself would come back in style and that one day, Just maybe, I could fit into again. Absolutely everything in those boxes could easily be replaced if need be. 

I got home, looked at what I did have and realized I could even do away with more. I am in no way an overnight extremist in minimalism, and probably could stand to get rid of even more things, but I felt like I had taken a step in the right direction. A step that will lead to wiser spending and less clutter. (Or at least a cleaner closet) "	t5_2r0z9	True

But when I see posts that say ""What kind of speakers should I buy"" and ""the ultimate minimalist wallet"" and finally ""I would like to break open the 'women are shop-a-holics' stereotype."" then I just want to give everyone a very friendly reminder that there are related sub-reddits such as ""Anti-Consumption"", ""Frugal"", and ""Interior Design"".

They are generally well behaved and such, but they all have the bad habit of 1) leaving dishes in the sink and/or 2) hoarding dishes in their rooms until it stacks up enough for them to require washing; they often combine the two.  In order to not treat them like children, I try not to ask them too often to fix these tendencies.  I decided that a little psychology may be needed.

Hypothesis: If they run out of dishes, they are REQUIRED to wash what they have in order to use them. Therefore, if I make the number of each type of dish and utensil closer to the number of people in the house, they will be morally obligated to wash everything immediately lest someone else not have clean dishes to use.

Observation: Initially I told them that I reduced the number of kitchen items to reduce clutter; nobody took issue with it.  For the first few days the bad habits continued, but each time I made sure one of them asked the others for dishes when they ran out. About 3 days into it, there was a steady stream of clean dishes in the dishwasher and drying rack.  SUCCESS!

I had never taken money out of my saving accounts, and in under two months, I spent about 3000$ on various necessities. My disposable income shrinked by 700$ a month, and to top it off I needed to get back to 15000$ by the end of the summer (I'm saving for college). Naturally, my first reaction was to cut spending: no more eating out, no more buying instantly.

It has been two months now. I have reached my objectives, but my spending didn't go up. In all that time, I went through 2 gas tanks instead of 5, ate out a single time to meet a client, and I didn't feel like I missed out on anything. In fact, I felt good.

In those ~4 months, I tossed or donated everything I didn't need, stopped buying things I didn't need and barely even changed my habits. I couldn't call this minimalism, but getting rid of so much stuff I thought was necessary was a great learning experience.

My sister and I have gone out shopping on Black Friday for the past 4 or 5 years. We don't get up early but around 9 we start meandering around. I wasn't super excited about it but I figured I'd go anyways because we live 8 hours apart and I just don't see her often and I had some shopping I'd been putting off. 

Throughout the day I saw lots of things that were cheap or great deals especially DVDs and I just realized I wasn't really interested in them. Through a morning of shopping I ended up just a few things:

*a second copy of a game that my boyfriend and I have nearly worn out
*two new pairs of jeans (in a smaller size, apparently I'm minimizing my hips too)
*another board game (the BF and I spend a lot of nights at home playing games)

1341846759.0	w9u1j	FAQ		134	17	38	"I think there should be a Frequently Asked Question page. Here's what should be in it.

Q:What does minimalism Mean?

A:Minimalism is the act of reducing the things in your life to only what is necessary. Some people only reduce physical objects, whereas other people reduce digital items, or even people.

Q:Why be a minimalist?

A:Life is short, and minimalists consider it to be a waste of time and energy to take care of things which aren't necessary.

Q:How can I start being a minimalist?

A:Try an exercise called the three month rule. Write down all the things you use in three months. Anything not on the list after that time, you probably don't need (with the exception of things like birth certificate, etc.).

Q:How do I deal with getting rid of objects that have sentimental value to me?

A:Consider taking photographs of objects that have special meaning to you. The pictures will take up no room in cyber-space, and will give you the same memories that the real object would. For objects that have moving parts, consider taking multiple photos, or a video. Store all of these files on an external hard drive, to make sure that they don't get deleted if your computer dies.

Q:How minimal should I be?

A:That is a matter of preference. Some people are only minimally minimal because they reduce just the things that get in the way. Some people are excessively minimal; they live out of just a backpack. A good place in the middle, which most people aspire to, is to fit everything they own into their car. This means they can move whenever they want with minimal hassle.

Q:Should I get rid of X item?

A:If you are not sure you'll need or want something, simply put it away in a garage/closet for a few months. If you don't use it for that amount of time, you probably don't need it. This way you won't have to buy it again if you want it back later on.

Q:How do I deal with knowing that I am losing money when I get rid of things?

A:You aren't actually wasting the money that you spent, only the object it's self. Read this article for more information. http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/ TLDR: If you read the article it will explain why you aren't actually losing any money from getting rid of your stuff, only the object. So all that really matters is whether or not you are willing to lose the object.

Q:I've just had a radical change in my life, is this a good opportunity to become a minimalist?

A:Absolutely not. If you are in a heightened, lowered, or generally altered emotional state, you might feel different a few months, weeks, or even days from now than you already do. Wait until you are feeling like your normal self before making such a radical life change.

Q:I still can't decide how minimalist I want to be!

A:You don't have to decide what level you want to be at, then instantly achieve that level. Gradually reduce over time and you'll eventually find a place where you are comfortable.

Q:My parents/spouse/ex gay lover/cat is not okay with my being a minimalist. OR, they are so excessive that they are counterbalancing my ability to be a minimalist.

A:

1. Explain to this person that you are a minimalist, and that they need to respect that.

2. Explain that even if they don't want to reduce, they still need to clean up after themselves.

3. Explain that you are willing to make compromises with them if they are willing to make compromises with you.

4. If your roommate/robot/yoga instructor/fellow twilight enthusiast isn't able to agree with the above three steps, you should consider getting a little bit of distance from them, if that's appropriate for you. Otherwise, you'll have to deal with it.

Q:I just got rid of a bunch of stuff, and I am proud of myself!

A:Great! This is called ""purging"" and we all do it. It would be appreciated if you took before and after pictures, and posted them here, so we can give you free karma.

Q:Somebody made a post about digital minimalism, or some other form of minimalism which doesn't have to do with physical objects! I hate them and think that they are stupid devil spawn.

A:Hold your britches, sonny! Some people like to reduce all parts of their lives, not just the physical ones. You shouldn't downvote just because someone has a different brand of minimalism than you do.

Q:Somebody posted a product on here, and I think that is advertising! DOWNVOTES FOR YOU!

A:Don't downvote based on advertising. Usually the redditor is just trying to share inside knowledge about a product that you wouldn't be able to attain unless you bought it. This is widely appreciated here. It is pretty unlikely that any company would spend money advertising on such a small subreddit. There isn't a large enough audience to make a profit from it.

Q:How can I help out this subreddit?

A:

1. Tell your friends

2. Post before/after pictures of purging. Put all the things you are throwing away in a pile, and post pictures of it. If you think you own a very minimal amount of things, take a picture of that. Finally, photograph all of your belongings together when you are about to move.

3. Comment (kindly) on people's posts.

4. Don't just read the ""what's hot"" tab. Also go to the ""new"" tab to see posts which are new and haven't been upvoted yet.

5. Don't downvote just because someone has a different opinion than you. Only downvote if they are legitimately being offensive to you, or are displaying content which is incorrect.

Q:I don't like this FAQ. It looks bad and you should feel bad!

These are objects with a high enough utility for me to justify keeping them around, but I don't use them enough to warrant a place, for example, on a shelf or table.

For example, I have a small drawer that contains a tape measure, a few unused USB drives, a card game I play with friends, a pair of headphones I use while running, a yo-yo, spare checkbooks, and a few writing materials like erasers and chalk.

I'm curious if anyone has found a novel way to deal with the junk drawer, or if it's something that one simply accepts. I don't like to obsess over small details, but it troubles me that pretty much all my other possessions have defined spaces that make sense to me. The junk drawer seems to be at odds with any coherent system of organization."	t5_2r0z9	True

1371627424.0	1gn59h	Notifications were taking over my life. (Deleted almost every social networking site/app I used.)	keepcalmandreadbooks	143	29	60	"I posted here a week or so ago, concerning my social networking habits and how it was affecting my dream (becoming a writer), and wanted to share what I did and how it's affected my life so far. First of all, here is everything I did.

1. **I deleted every social networking site/app I've ever used, with one exception: Twitter**. Twitter is incredibly fast, minimalistic, and simple. I don't waste time on it. I can send a tweet in five seconds, as much as I want.

2. **I switched to using only one e-mail**. I had five or so e-mails. One for Yahoo, one for G-mail, one for this, one for that. Over time I just found myself making different accounts because I needed to create one to use their service; G-mail to use my Android phone, Yahoo to get on Yahoo Answers, etc. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except for the past few years I have signed up for different stuff with different e-mails, so I had to balance all of these e-mails, remember them all, etc. I chose one e-mail, updated all of my contacts, redirected all of my traffic, and updated my e-mails for all the accounts I need. And guys, seriously, check out the new Outlook.com e-mail: it is the most elegant and simple e-mail I have ever used.

It's only been one week, but the changes are already incredible. Having just one social networking site/app has made my life ten times easier. When I want to tweet or share a picture, I do it and it's done. I don't feel the need to share it to Instagram as well, or consider posting it on FaceBook/Google+, I don't need to edit it at all or put a filter or anything. I don't have a a bunch of friends sending me Snapchats that I have to hold down for a few seconds just to view, I don't have FaceBook notifications blowing up my phone/e-mail, I don't spend thirty minutes on the internet before I actually do what I got on the computer to do in the first place.

I don't necessarily believe that social media is evil, but I always thought that there would be something that ""takes over"" again, much like FaceBook took over MySpace. I kept wanting to be on that bandwagon before it happened. But what I've come to realize is that that time has gone. There might not ever be another social networking site that everyone jumps on. There's just too much social media right now, and probably always will be. I think it's best to just choose your favorite, and *only* use that social media. Just one, if that. I think signing up for all these new apps/sites that are coming out (Vine, Instagram, Snapchat, Google+, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest...) just creates all this extra complexity in our minds. We take a picture of something or someone and go through an entire list of possible social media to send it out to, and not appreciate the picture for what it actually represents.

In just this one week, I've been able to focus more on what I want to do, which is write. When I finish a blog, I make one tweet about it, and that's it. I'm not posting it on every single social site I used before, making it perfect, with a perfect picture, etc. And when I get on my phone, having just one social app makes my life much easier, as well as on the computer. I can take care of all my mentions/DMs in just a minute or two, whereas before, I would be bombarded with notifications from tons of other sites. I've truly found a large, emptiness inside my own mind, a place that I'm not used to, clarity, a place where I used to contain a list of all the social media I used and what to update when where how often etc. I literally am having this moment every time I get on my phone or computer where I feel this large empty space that I realize used to be occupied with social media, and it feels great moving forward into it and filling it with things I actually want and need to to.

I'm not trying to advertise my website or anything, *promise*, but I did do a lengthier, more in-depth blog about this. (And I mention you guys, too. :) ) Thanks again for everything guys, this is the best subreddit I've found on Reddit, it continues time and time again to have a direct effect on my life. http://dwarsement.com/2013/06/18/notifications-are-taking-over-your-life/

However, I just recently found the motivation I needed to seriously pursue minimalism, moving beyond my former 'man, my room looks kinda trashy...time to chunk my crap' reasons:

Last week, a close friend of mine's mother died suddenly while on a trip abroad. We quickly began going through her and her mother's things and packing them up to avoid paying rent on their apartment for August. We had just 3 days to get everything they owned out. 

The whole experience has been very eye-opening for me about the stuff we collect in our lives. When forced to decide what to keep and what to throw out, my friend opted to get rid of every single thing in the apartment except a handful of sentimental items and important papers (though, we decided to keep more than she asked us to because we didn't know what might end up being important, since she's not back in the country to help us yet). Nothing else was worth it to her to keep. It made me realize how much of what we hold on to doesn't mean anything in the long run. A whole lifetime worth of physical things was boiled down to a sweater, a lock-box, papers, and some jewelry.

In the aftermath of all this, I have never been more motivated to get serious about minimalizing my own life. At first, it was simply fear driving me. I just kept thinking 'there's no freaking way I going to die and leave my family with such a huge, heartbreaking task of going through mountains of my stuff. Time to throw away everything meaningless/sad/embarrassing/etc!' But then I began to ask myself: at the end of the day, what will I actually leave behind, and what will it say about me? Will it be a house full of junk, offenses that were left unforgiven and unaddressed, etc? 

I've realized that the only real mark I want to leave on this planet are lasting, happy memories in the hearts of the people I love. I need to stop spending my time on relationships that waste my effort and leave me feeling bitter, stop holding on to physical things that I never use or even look at, or clinging to painful memories I won't let go of. Life is too short to anchor yourself to useless 'stuff' like this. Minimalism (to me personally, so take that as you will) isn't just about what I own; it's about ALL of the things I take with me in life. My objects, my thoughts, my friends, etc. I should aim to spend less time with my things and my emotional baggage, and more with the people I love.

Maybe this is just an over-reaction to a sudden tragedy, but it feels like such a significant realization for me that I needed to take a moment and share. ...Anyway, has anyone else had a similar experience/realization? I am interested to hear your take on mortality and minimalism (is that even a thing?), minimalism as a means to prioritize your life, etc. I might be jumping too eagerly into the deep end here, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.


**TL;DR:** Got super-motivated to pursue minimalism after going through personal items after a death caused to me re-evaluate what's worth keeping in life.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for the touching stories! It took me a few days to get back on here since my current schedule isn't conducive to daily redditing, so I am just now seeing all these responses. I very much appreciate hearing what you guys have experienced.

While visiting, I decided to get rid of my childhood mementos, artwork, schoolwork, letters, etc. There were about 5 large boxes filled with thousands of papers. Out of those boxes, I kept 5 pieces of paper.

I've been minimizing for over a year, but this was my most profound moment. As I looked back through schoolwork and old journals, the feelings of frustration/worthlessness that I felt in my youth began to wash back over me. After an hour of reading awful college papers and looking over meaningless awards, I snapped out of it and threw everything in the trash.

The bad feelings from my younger days no longer serve me. Whatever memories I need are right here in my head. When they're gone, I'll still be me.

I slept very well last night. I woke up feeling like a new person.

A storage closet had been overlooked in the packing, and by the time we noticed, it was too late. 

Many years later, I happened to be in a small village about 40 miles outside of the city when I walked past a small antiques store. I felt compelled to enter, though I don't know why. I had no money. 

The store was pretty much stuffed with the items I had lost in the move several years before. Having no money, I knew I couldn't buy these things back. Having some sanity, I knew no one would actually believe me if I tried to tell them ""this stuff is actually all MINE!""

So, another several years go by and I end up in the same small town on a day trip, this time with money in my pocket. I decided to stop into the store to see if any of Mom's things were still there and of course, they were not. 

However, as I was leaving, a small coffee cup on a back shelf caught my eye for no good reason. I felt compelled to look at it and, ironically, it was a Frankoma brand cup with the single word ""Okie"" inscribed on it. My mother had been a proud Okie, and knew Frankoma long before Martha Stewart was born. The price was $5. 

Yes, I bought it and use it regularly. I keep it as a smaller reminder of how I learned to let go of the deeply sentimental, but not really applicable to my lifestyle, ephemera and stuff, got a cool (and rare) coffee cup, a wonderful story, and the perfect item with which to remember my Mom.

Living simple to me is not necessarily removing all things from my life, but removing things that cause distraction. After I discovered this subreddit, I saw a lifestyle that I had been looking for. 

Slowly I began to look at my own life and see things that I could get rid of. I went through all of my possessions and saw things that I could donate or sell. Trash bag by trash bag by trash bag, I felt better and better. I no longer have to rifle through my closet in the morning for an outfit. I have five set outfits that I grab and go. No more of the wasted time. I've removed the dumb knickknacks from my college dorm that I thought I needed. What used to be a constant burden to clean and maintain, is now a simple area that looks and feels very clean. What started out as just an idea, has now become my entire philosophy. I can get back to my dorm space after a long day from classes and feel zen in my room. Not very many people can say that. 

Going further, I've removed computer time little by little. I honestly can say that I was addicted to the internet. I craved it and would go mad if I didn't have it for the smallest amounts of time. Replacing that is new hobbies. I read books now, I meditate every other day, I walk around campus, and more. I told my facebook ""friends"" that if they needed me they had my cell number and deactivated it. I can now also say truthfully that I have less than 20 apps downloaded on my phone. I just don't feel the constant need to be connected to the entire world anymore. 

I have never felt so comfortable with myself. I've finally found my niche.

1327195905.0	oqwmq	Minimalism in FightClub the Movie	nexe	116	19	25	"I watched FightClub for the first time in a few years the other night and this time I was mainly amazed by the amount of quotes and ideas about minimalism. If you haven't seen it yet and are a fan of minimalism (high probability if you're reading this) you gotta watch this movie. Here are just a few quotes:

* This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.
* It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. 
* The things you own end up owning you. 
* Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
* You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
* Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct. 
* I ran. I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid. Then I ran some more. (this, because it is so pure in itself and just makes me wanna go for a run - which is one of my more minimalist hobbies)
* If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person? (thought of traveling with very little, very far away in a different timezone and yes, I felt like a different person for a while)
* Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me. That condo was my life, okay? I loved every stick of furniture in that place. That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed, it was ME!
* We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
* You had to give it to him: he had a plan. And it started to make sense, in a Tyler sort of way. No fear. No distractions. The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide. 
* Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction... (gotta destroy your old self before you can improve)
* Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar. Stop trying to control everything and just let go! LET GO!
* By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV. 
* It's just, when you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it. That's the last sofa I'm gonna need. Whatever else happens, I've got that sofa problem handled. 
* I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections, proof they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working indigenous peoples of... wherever. 
* Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic.

* Worker bees can leave. Even drones can fly away. The Queen is their slave. (thanks andrewhyde)

1341524329.0	w3hmw	Over-zealousness in the minimalist community and you!		109	11	26	"Like I've stated before, I've been a minimalist for about five years -- and it's been a struggle. Periods of questioning minimalism and fighting the urge of consumerism. It's only been since subscribing to this subreddit that I've really overcome my personal demons and truly embraced material minimalism -- keeping my material possessions to a minimal. I've still got a lot of mental clutter, but I'll post that over in /r/Buddhism. :-)

I'm beginning to notice a few things about this subreddit and would like to discuss them. For one, a LOT of people are posting about their hobbies -- almost to the point of having an existential crisis because they have too many tackles in the tackle-box or one too many golf clubs. The thing that disturbs me about this is that minimalism is supposed to be about breaking free of the bonds of material possession -- not fretting over the extra knife in their kitchen cabinet.

Someone once pointed out to me, on this very subreddit, that minimalism draws a few different types of crowds. Some people are interested more in the aesthetic minimalism (google ""minimalist house"" and you'll see what I'm talking about) or getting their possessions down the lowest possible amount. Others, still, are interested in getting rid of clutter in their life to focus on other things -- like family, friends, etc. And others are a mishmash of different things, becoming interested in the lifestyle through Zen Habits, Miss Minimalist, 100-things-or-less, whatever.

Therefore, /r/minimalism has a lot of different viewpoints and each member can contribute something. That's why I was hoping to sort of air out some of the feelings that I've been having and maybe we can discuss them together.

1.) Minimalism shouldn't be about obsessing whether or not you have too much of something to the point that you're letting your other interests fade away or the thing that you actually care about becomes clouded. For example, someone recently posted about Legos. If legos bring you joy, by all means, keep them! Minimalism is about getting rid of everything that doesn't work for you -- that weekend you thought you'd become a fisherman and bought all of those rods or those six pair of jeans when you're a sweatpants kinda girl.  In my experience, minimalism has showed me EXACTLY what I do care about because it wouldn't make sense to me to throw away my tablet PC when I spend a lot of time reading and browsing the internet. Those books in the corner though? I don't even miss 'em.

2.) Be your own minimalist! What initially attracted me deeper into minimalism was Zen Habits. I thought the owner was so cool and really enjoyed taking his life slowly. But on the other hand, it took me a long time to realize that I didn't want to be like Leo. Or Miss Minimalist. Or Bruno. Or any of the other prominent minimalists. I wanted to be myself, and that meant that while I could take inspiration from some guy who fit all of his stuff in the pouch of his mountain bike, I was much happier giving my stuff space to breathe.

3.) You don't have to buy a mac to be a minimalist. I know it's trendy and hip, and I think that's where some people get a little confused and look down on minimalism. Minimalism is about cherishing what you HAVE instead of working for getting something you WANT. Now I'm not saying that ultimately buying something that you've worked for and you think will improve your life is bad, I'm just saying don't buy Apple because you want to fit in with the rest of the gang. If you like Apple and its interface or whatever, that's cool. I like Windows and Android and all that, but I can appreciate the minimalist aesthetics of Apple.

4.) No one is going to judge you for sleeping on a bed if you want to. Or driving a car. You don't have to worry about every little thing in your life, especially if it's convenient and you enjoy it. Yes, it's cool to challenge conventional wisdom or sleep like some modern-day Samurai on your fold-up bed -- but it isn't necessary. Again, don't feel like you have to either become super-rich or homeless to be a proper minimalist.

Well, it's nice to get that off my chest. I'm not sure how the rest of the community will react to it, but I just noticed some of these things going on and wanted to talk about it."	t5_2r0z9	True

The ultimate trial came: Christmas. Usually this is one of the only times I'd ever wear any of those clothes, but this year I challenged myself to have the courage to wear my new fancy clothes. And I did. I got a few comments on my suit, but they were all positive.

That was all the encouragement I needed. I packed up the entire right half of my closet and didn't look back. In the end, I took 3 large shopping bags stuffed full of these lightly-used to never-worn clothes to Goodwill, and I felt great about it. http://i.imgur.com/JsZNJQO.jpg

While sitting with my father (an avid and exceptional photographer) the other day, he related some stories about his own life and how he goes through phases of purging, acquiring, purging, and so on.  He said that most people go through this a few times through out their lives.

He also considers himself a minimalist.

I had to question this because he has a collection of vintage camera's, some working, some not, some new and some old.  This includes a few 8mm and slide projectors, too.

He defended himself by saying that when he goes out ""on the hunt"" looking for the next great picture, he only brings 1 camera, and on a rare occasion 2 lenses.  So when he is out in the field he is a minimalist.

Then he sat and thought for a minute and said:  

""I'm a minimalist with options"".



EDIT:  Thanks for all the comments, and yes I agree that minimalism isn't about getting rid of everything.  I just thought this was a funny anecdote and wanted to share.

1344555746.0	xyudy	I just spent a week looking for the highest quality and lowest budget TV in the world. Probably wasted 40 hours. You know what I just realized? I don't need a TV or want a TV. I wouldn't use a TV. What have you avoided buying to help minimalism in your life?	bbqturtle	121	28	126	"Does everyone really need a TV for every screen in their house? Do I need to stress about money to afford something I don't even need to use?

Sure, I have a computer to type this on. The monitor can do anything a TV can do (besides cable). This is a big step for me, the step where I think about when I should stop buying things and start enjoying life.

I think that day is today.

What have you avoided in your life to help make your life more fulfilling?

**EDIT:** I fail.

I am going to buy a TV next Wednesday. Not having a TV to entertain guests was just too much to bear.

In fact, most of the things I own, my kitchen, my entryway, my coffee table, are all for entertaining guests. I am not good at this minimalism thing. It sounds nice, but I'm not sure how to actually enjoy or proceed with initializing any minimalism in my life.
I could use some tips.

**edit 2**: probably old enough post where nobody will see. 

I would use the tv for Netflix and video games. My girlfriend and I really like to play video games, and she likes using the tv. I could see us using my computer (in my bedroom) but there's not good/relaxing places to sit. 

The only time I'd use the tv is to put on a Netflix movie as everyone is winding down, and play vid games when it's just me and a buddy or two. My girlfriend says ""don't ever expect people to come over if you don't have one"" which sounds really negative, but I know from experience that her and her friends usually just sit around and watch sports/Disney movies and kinda ignore each other (we are both 21 but many of our friends are 19-20 not that it makes a difference. 

Getting a nice piece of art is a good idea. I am not short of things to do. I am just scared of the void in the wall where all my furniture is oriented towards a 42in gap in the room. I could easily move a couch around so they are facing each other, put a coffee table in the middle, and art on both walls. That sounds nice :)"	t5_2r0z9	True

My accumulation of cyber junk has been bothering me for a while, but a few gears have started engaging for me to actually do something about it.

A few months ago I went through my browser's bookmarks and cleaned out a bunch of junk, but stalled there.

Now, I'm going through my other computer and Internet flotsam to see what I can cut. I've just bashed out of Facebook, and feel relieved; I believe I'll feel more relieved in two weeks when the official ""you're deleted"" happens [for once, I feel good for not being Tron here; being rezzed feels good in the real word]. Next up, parcing down my crop of email addresses that have exploded the past number of years, as well as seeing about cutting out one of my hosted websites.

As for files on local machines at home, I'm slowly going through my music files [I started with ~55.3GB, and that should really be less I think], audio books I've collected but not listened to and/or deleted [but starting to now], useless documents and pictures...

1369833179.0	1f9l9w	Reduce entertainment. Allow ideas to flourish.	minimalisto	105	10	26	"This post may be controversial. You will likely want to defend these things you find precious. All I ask is that you approach the following with an open mind, and give it a try before condemning it. Feel free to cross-post this wherever you like, I'm not in it for the karma. 

We all need to stop. 

Each day we are in constant motion. If we are not doing daily chores, we are working or commuting. We eat, we snack. At night we prepare for the next day, socialize, and sleep. 

Any time that we have available in the schedule above, gets filled with entertainment, whatever easy and quick *thing* we can find to occupy our minds. 

---

Have you ever wondered why many brilliant ideas come to us in the shower? 

What makes standing naked embracing a sputtering shower head of perhaps too hot or too cold water, groggily scrubbing our nether regions, so conductive to ideas? 

Doesn't it seem like almost any other place would be better? Like at your desk with your favorite music playing as you sit down to work? 

Ideas also seem to come to us as we try to get much needed sleep, and for some people, even in their sleep! Of all the times our ideas could interrupt us, why show up now? 

---

The truth of the matter is, these moments are the few we have left to think. They are the only chances our brain gets to ponder ideas and come to conclusions without being distracted. 

I ask that you put down your entertainment for just a moment, give your brain a little room to breath, a little time to think and see what floats to the surface. 

Minimalism needs direction.

The purpose of minimalism is to focus on what makes you happy and/or brings meaning to your life. 

If you do not have the mental clarity to determine what is the crucial and what is the crap -- if you  do not have the time to think over your decisions before you direct your life, how can you avoid both cliff and chasm as you travel toward an ocean of calm satisfaction? 

That which brings meaning to your life, and that which makes you happy and satisfied change. They constantly change. If you do not perceive this change and adjust your life to fit it, you will find yourself making poor decisions at the wrong time and for the worst reasons. 

---

So this is what I propose. Give yourself time. Time to sit inside of yourself, let thoughts come and go and present no distraction. 

This is not meditation. You are not trying to quiet all thought. Instead you are embracing the thoughts as they come, and letting them flow to wherever they may go. You may grasp them for a while, think on them, before moving on. 

You do not will yourself to think on one specific topic. No effort is required. For each subject that comes up, address it and think on it for as long as you like. 

You will be surprised as to where your thoughts lead, and how the most innocuous moments can bring amazing revelations -- and yet others just reaffirm your convictions. 

---

So where does this time to think, to reflect, and to be open to thoughts without distraction come from? 

The little gaps you fill with entertainment. For some of us, the gaps might be quite big. 

It would be nice if everyone was less busy, and could naturally afford the time to think, but while I endorse simplifying your life and freeing time, this seems a more universally applicable way. Entertainment is easier to reduce compared to quitting a 9-5 job for instance. 

In your daily life, whenever you have time to watch an episode of television, browse the internet, play a video game, watch a movie, text on your phone, randomly browse your phone out of boredom -- do this instead. 

I realize many of you will be saying that surely you can't get rid of all your television, that would be impractical sitting for many hours at night. And perhaps you are right, and certainly at first that might be torturous. 

But do you need entertainment while eating alone? Really, do you? Once you finish and have a half hour before lunch break is over -- does that half hour honestly need to be used for entertainment? 

Could you truly not survive for a half hour without a thing to do but sit and rest? 

---

This is what I propose. Find the little gaps at first, the 5 minute pauses, the 10 minute breaks, and the half hour rests. 

The time spent waiting in line. Time spent waiting for a friend to arrive. Time spent commuting, time before bed, and before work. 

Take this time and remove from it distraction. Cast away your entertainment for the time being, and let your thoughts come and go. 

Give your brain the time it needs to analyze your life, your day, the past hour, and your last conversation. 

Now watch your time in the shower, and when you are trying to sleep. The ideas do not come as easily. They were set free earlier in the day at better times, and your mind is at ease. 

---

If you have tried this experiment and found merit, you can start to increase the time you spend just thinking. Try getting comfortable just sitting for an hour. Let yourself think and daydream and not rely on the buzzing or whirring of devices. 


----

Addendum: 

I believe there are many cases where entertainment can be seen doing more good than bad to support my thoughts above. 

Consider running. Some run in a gym on a treadmill watching television and listening to music. 

Some run outdoors with an ipod blaring. 

Yet even with as much motivational music as you can pack into a mp3 player, you can often find so much more motivation by unplugging. 

Running out doors with nothing but the sound of your breath, footfalls, and the outdoors. 

I've also noticed just how entertainment-dependent we've become. People take their smartphones into the washroom and use them during dinner! When was the last time you ate a meal and sat in quiet? 


Now I know many of you might say that entertainment isn't harmful in moderation, and that is is unrealistic to give it up completely -- and I agree. 

The real problem with this philosophy though, is that everyone's level of moderation, the appropriate amount of entertainment, of distraction, will be different. 

The only way you can discover the amount that is right for you is to remove all of it, or at least more than you are comfortable with, and see how you survive. 

We are all horders of not things, but entertainment. We couldn't bear to lose a minute of it. But if we push past our comfortable zone, we will see it's not so bad. 

Continue pushing past our comfort and reducing the amount of entertainment we have, and we will eventually reach a normal amount. 

That is what I am advocating. Not a complete removal, but a reduction appropriate for our minds to recover their health and have room to grow and think.

I'm a husband and father of 2 that's trying to get started with minimalism.  We're selling, donating, and trashing.  One of the benefits of this whole process is that I now know where the things that matter are located.  I've found missing tools, found places for the things we need so that I know where they are.  It's been great.

As part of this process I recognized that our food situation is similarly disorganized.  We spend way too much on food, and I think part of the reason is that since there is so much buried we don't know what we have, so we buy things we don't really need.  We end up throwing out too much.

My wife an I are doing an experiment.  We're going to see how long we can go without buying anything more than perishable stuff, like milk and eggs.  If we're hungry we just find something.  We've been going for like 3 weeks and have in that time barely bought anything.  I'm eating canned peaches and canned green beans for lunch sometimes.  Making rice.  Putting black beans and salsa on it.  Making ramen noodles.

I've found all kinds of things in the freezer I didn't know we had.  Ground beef, venison, kabobs.  We're eating all that up.

It's great now being able to shut the freezer drawer without difficulty.  I can see what's in the pantry better, so I can plan my meals.  In the short term it's obviously saving us a lot of money, but long term I'm hoping that the organization helps us be more efficient with our food."	t5_2r0z9	True

""down-sizing""), we have a tendency to push everything to the edges of the room.  The reality?  Unless you have a dance party or friends who love to sit on the floor, you don't need the space in the middle of the room, and in fact, if we are talking about putting your things in a smaller space, it wastes space.

A bedroom is a good example of a place where you'd rarely need empty space.  So take your bed off the wall and angle it out perpendicular into the room.  In this way, you almost create more space, having more space along the edges for a desk or whatnot, while not losing any real space.

Just some words of advice when you're thinking about redoing a room!  I'm by no means an interior decorator, but the point remains; unless you have a specified use for an empty space (and indeed, many of us might), fill that space and you will have, strangely enough, a more filled out and spacious room.

Protip: An added bonus of this type of setup is to take away from the very bare look that many minimal rooms can take on."	t5_2r0z9	True

I am a 26 year old Mexican entrepreneur, I moved out at 17 and I've been around a bit. I live 2000km+ away from home and managed to make it on my own all this time. 

I chose minimalism because I suffered through extreme poverty sometime after being emancipated, having been born in an upper middle class family I realized money is not important and not even a priority. Material things only exist to weigh you down and take control of your life. 

Through a lot of learning and self-discovery I chose this path, I can say I am a lot better grounded than any relative my age. 

My current apartment, well I used to have a much bigger one, about 700 square feet or so and I hated it because it was too big, hard to keep clean, mostly empty, etc. 

I chose this one because it was a bit cheaper and much smaller, meaning I could own less stuff and have it look a bit more homely.

Anyway, it's around 250 square feet, kitchen/living room/bathroom are about 170 square feet and the bedroom is about 80. Ceilings are very short, around 6'3 in the main room and 6 in the bedroom, but I'm 5'8 so not a problem. It's also good because heating is easier, it's cold where I live.

Key thing:
I don't own a car, never have, I chose my apartment specifically because of location and it's a 1km walk to the office. I love cycling but I currently don't own a bike. Everyone in my city who can afford it drives a car but I chose not to for environmental/sustainability issues. I believe we should strive to live within the means of our planet. Current living standards are unsustainable and they are destroying the world. I carry the same philosophy about health and our bodies. 

Oh and one more thing, I am completely self-taught. Last year I finished was 5th grade of elementary school. I studied English on my own since I was about 12 years old; thankfully I've had access to the Internet since then and have managed to become a bit cultured if I may say so, which enabled me to discover different ways of thinking, including minimalism. I owe who I am to free access to all the information I could desire.

The fact is, checking my school e-mail three times a day is necessary to succeed.

I think maybe a better look on computers and minimalism is minimizing your computer experience.  Not even the time spent in front of one; there's nothing that says you can't be a computer programmer and a minimalist at the same time.  But to me, this means cleaning up much of the clutter and bullshit (my Reddit account has any entertaining subs gone and is used for hobbies/interests and news now).

I am fairly new to this subreddit, and to minimalism. I am in the process of learning how to get clutter out of my life, and live a more simple life. 

In doing so, I have stopped doing my regular make up routine. I used to do my foundation, do my eye shadow (opps, its not right, so do it again...), do my eyebrows, put on mascara, contour my face, then highlight, then blush. This used to take me at least 15-20 minutes EVERYDAY! Now with my hair I already feel like I have been minimal with it for the past 7 years. I wont be giving up the shampoo and conditioner. Usually I shower at night, and let my hair dry and just go with it in the morning. So no big issue there.


I have recently cut my makeup time down to 3 minutes. I apply the smallest bit of foundation, and only apply mascara, and maybe some eyeliner and blush to make myself look alive. I think I look much better without all the junk on my face anyway.

So what do you do for your minimal makeup and hair? Do you wear makeup? I would like to know, and see if there are other tips that I could use!

Just wanted to thank people discussing minimalism in this subreddit and whomever wrote the FAQ here. I'm on my first steps in keeping the things, thoughts, and events in my life that make it worth living and getting rid of those unnecessary.

I started by selling my Playstation 3 and iPad, gave away my printer and a few old computer parts and cables I was keeping and donating some clothes and shoes I was rarely using. It's probably not much, but I feel good about it.

My next step is cleaning up my library by donating a few books that I don't need to the local hackerspace and selling some additional electronics I barely ever use.

Thank you :)"	t5_2r0z9	True

I would like to suggest a movie to you all , called [Koyaanisqatsi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/).

While not dealing with minimalism *directly*, it is definitely minimalistic in it's approach. No dialogue, no actors, and no plot *per se*. The movie is a series of beautiful scenes with an awesome minimalist soundtrack composed by Phillip Glass.

Koyaanisqatsi is a Hopi indian term for ""life out of balance"", and that's exactly what you see in the movie. It has a heavy environmental subtext, and deals mostly with duality man/nature, as well as the imbalance of human society in contemporary times. But that's just my reading of it.

This is a movie to be experienced, not understood.

I also suggest finding the biggest screen you have access to, and a pair of good headphones/surround system. Trust me.

I have seen the movie online on Vimeo, and I am sure you can obtain it by other means if necessary.

Enjoy ;)!

A while back I killed off several other social profiles: foursquare, pinterest, 43things, Delicious and really scads upon scads of others. I closed my self-hosted blog and went to Tumblr, with the idea that I'd move to even more simple publishing solutions to feed my writing habit. I deleted six email accounts I had and consolidated now down to two, with the idea that I still need one for legitimate communication and another one for the odd form that demands an email address.

most of these aren't that big of a deal to just delete. But the ubiquity of FB means that a lot of communication happens through there, but it's also an incredibly time waster, trends toward superficial disscussion and, to be honest, I don't want to know about people as much as they sometimes want to share.

Why the slow back off? I don't want people to go mad when I just delete the FB account and think I've gone mental and killed myself or something. And, I also want to migrate some people toward getting used to contacting me via email instead of FB posts and such, and this seems to actually be a process as so many people are used to interacting through it.

Has anyone here purposefully moved off FB after being on it for a while, and did you just delete it full stop, or do anything over a period of time?"	t5_2r0z9	True

But for the past 6 years, I've had this massive baggage hanging over my head: the need to organise my hard drive. Every semester that goes by, I tell myself I'll do it in the holidays and I never do, because it's too much. I have terabytes worth of stuff that needs organising and that I'll *one day attend to*. I am also a writer and I find ideas very precious, so I have millions of ideas that I've accumulated over the years that I write down in little text documents that I'll one day find use for - that I'll *one day* write a story with. I have music that I don't even listen to anymore that I need to organise, pictures I saved, gazillions of bookmarks on each of my browsers that I'll one day research and read about, and so on. The burden of needing to get it all sorted makes me anxious every time I think about it, but I never even *thought* about deleting all of it up until this point. I never realised how inextricably attached I am to my virtual possessions that have accumulated and how much it clutters up my mind. Yet in the past few years, very few times have I gone back to visit an old idea I once wrote down or needed to visit a bookmark I saved. I'm always writing down newer and newer material, adding more and more bookmarks that I'll never really get around to reading.

I'm no expert, I've only just had this realisation, but here's an idea: **Focus on the present, on what you need right now.** I think the allure of nearly endless space that comes with virtual possessions can delude us into thinking we need things when we really don't. Minimalise your virtual space to what your current needs are and be very meticulous about what you keep for your future needs 'just in case'. Don't lie to yourself - will you really truly need it or are you just attached to all the time and effort you put into it? Don't be scared of forgetting things: if you do forget, it really isn't that important. It's only life. If you need something again, you'll find it somehow, or you'll find a way around it. 

I haven't gotten rid of it all yet, basically because I want to make sure I don't just mass delete things I know I will use really soon (like pictures for inspiration for when I'm redecorating my apartment). But I am so glad this realisation came and I hope it helps out a few of you, too. Good luck.

&gt; Or perhaps it was I who had forgiven?

and it got me thinking about the ""baggage"" and ""clutter"" we carry round as emotions like guilt, resentment or anger. 

Maybe forgiveness is the emotional equivalent of clearing out clutter? 

Forgive a bit (Yourself or someone else) every day and clear out a bit more space, like we do with our houses and our bedrooms. Not to have no emotions, but to more fully appreciate the ones we want to have, that serve us well.

1357175126.0	15uxn7	The Minimalist's Guide to Minimalism	indiefellow	91	15	20	"Hey there /r/minimalism ! I decided to write a quick guide/tip post for people who are wanting to know how to cut down on waste and excess material. Anyways, let's get started.

**Get In The Mindset - Silly Things First!**

If you snap into cleaning all of your house of all of your excess stuff without doing anything beforehand, you're gonna' have a bad time. Do the simple things like uninstalling apps on your phone you don't need, cleaning up your computer's program list, or dumping out all those used giftcards from your wallet. It starts to get you in the mindset of minimalism without doing too much work, and you'll be happy you did it later, because after you minimalize your living space, you'll be pretty exhausted.

When you're ready, this is when things get pretty dirty, but liberating.

**Step 1: Go to the store**

Now this might seem contradictory, but if you don't have any spare bins or boxes lying around, go buy a one or two jumbo plastic bins from Walmart or whatever, you'll be needing them. If you don't have any non-ripping trash bags, make sure to snag some of those too.

**Step 2: Seize the (a) day!**

Pick a day where you know you don't have much planned. This is the day you'll dump out containers, empty your wardrobe, put everything you don't need in bins, etc. The next steps are a more detailed look.

**Step 3: Move and Clean**

Have you ever seen a minimalist's bedroom that wasn't clean? Didn't think so. Put all of your belongings in your living space in one corner, and go to town. Vacuum, clean the stove, everything. Once you've done that, put all the furniture back, and clean all that off as well.

**Step 4: Empty**

Empty everything. Make 4 separate piles.

1.) Give away (useful, but you won't use it).

2.) Trash

3.) Sentimental (You don't have to throw away memories to be minimalist!!)

4.) Useful (or so you think)

Pack piles #1 and #2 in your car and go to the dump/good will. 

For #3, put all your sentimental stuff in a box (or tastefully put some of it on a shelf if it means a lot to you), and stow it away somewhere safe and out of sight, since usually that kind of stuff doesn't need to be lying in drawers or on counter tops. 

Remember those bins? For anything that isn't IMMEDIATELY useful (such as clothes you ALWAYS wear, or shoes you ALWAYS put on), put those non-immediately useful items neatly in the bins. Put your bins somewhere secluded in your living space (perhaps near your sentimental stuff), so that it's accessible, but not *too* easy to get to. If you don't want to bother getting the item because it's not convenient, then you DON'T need it. 

After 3-6 months, any items that are still in the bins that you haven't gotten out... Give away! Or throw away, whatever you want. Additionally, if you have any furniture used for storage (cabinets, shelves) that aren't being used anymore since you don't have as much stuff, go ahead and get rid of those, too.

**Step 5: Keep At It**

This is where things usually fall apart for most people. You know that habit you have of throwing those CD's in your desk, or tossing those books under your bed? Don't do it! Place them in the bins, or where they properly belong. If you let yourself keep cluttering your living space, you'll end up being right back where you started. 

And that's pretty much it! Comment if I left anything out.

I care about none of them, but don't care enough about them to even care if they aren't here. But I do like this subreddit and some of the setups are quite nice. The question I have is that if minimalism seems to clap at the idea of owning less, how then, when someone posts a picture of how little they own, but, on that laptop there are 1400 books, 200 movies and thousands of pictures, how is that different, in essense, from me having a bookshelf, photo albums and DVDs? You've replaced them in form, but you still haven't removed them. Basically, sometimes I get the impression that minimalism is about physical size reduction and not about owning less.

1357490138.0	162cuj	My Digital Minimalism	simondsaid	120	44	37	"I thought I'd share a segment of my minimalism journey. People have recently been posting bedroom photos.  I thought I'd post on how feel that I've achieved minimalism digitally.

Over the course of the last 6 months, having moved to a new city for graduate school, I have embraced the ideas and concepts of minimalism in my lifestyle and trying to eliminate clutter wherever possible. I don't have a car. I bike everywhere. I own one very nice fountain pen.  I essentially wear the same four shirts every week. I throw on a nice collared shirt when I need to (for presentations and teaching). I own only four pairs of shoes.  I have one nice suit and a tuxedo. I only have cable TV because my roommate insists on it but hardly watch it.

If I were to pack up to move tomorrow, it would take me less than 2 hours to pack everything that I own.

But I noticed in the past couple of months that my digital life was a little too cluttered.  I had apps everywhere on my tablet and smartphone and my laptop was a clutter of things going ""TAKE CARE OF ME NOW."" I was constantly checking my phone for those badges of numbers that I needed to take care of. My tablet was a plethora of things going ""READ ME, NO READ ME! CATCH UP ON THIS NEWS, ON THAT NEWS."" My devices controlled me, I didn't control my devices.

[So I minimalized everything digitally.](http://imgur.com/a/cX4m9)

**Tablet: iPad**

 * Only my most essential apps on the dock. Everything else is put into folders that are organized by function on a different page, out of sight.

 * [GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html): for all my documents and annotations.  I am a science graduate student and so I use GoodReader/Dropbox to handle all of my papers to read, lectures, and notes.

 * [Agenda](http://savvyapps.com/agenda/): easy, minimalistic calendar app. Shows what I need to know in a pretty and minimalistic-design fashion.

 * Pages: to type up documents and notes and keep my lab log on.

 * [Bamboo Paper](http://www.wacom.com/en/products/software/bamboo-paper): when I need pen and paper. Digitally of course.

 * [forScore](http://www.forscoreapp.com): I also use my iPad as my sheet music library.  I play piano to accompany for dance classes in my city's ballet company. Being able to carry around all my music on a single device is fantastic.

 * [Musicnotes](http://www.musicnotes.com/ipad/): to hold the sheet music I purchase for my band when we practice.

**Smartphone: iPhone** I got the iPad first for school. So when it came time for a smartphone, iPhone 4S made sense.
 
* [Dialvetica](http://mysterioustrousers.com/dialvetica): a great minimal ""get to the contact you need to contact"" app whether it is to email, message, or actually call.

* [Agenda](http://savvyapps.com/agenda/): same as on the iPad.

* Settings: to change things like bluetooth and whatnot.

* On my iPad and iPhone, I have only two ""pages"" for apps: one empty homescreen, the next is a folder of other apps that I don't really use everyday. The last one is just Newsstand since it won't rid itself. (Please Apple get rid of it!) 

**Laptop: 15"" Macbook Pro**

 * I got rid of my dock.  It was too distracting and took up screen real estate.  Hiding it still bothered me since if my cursor touched an edge, it would pop up.  So I axed it using Dock Gone 1.4. Still there.  I just don't see it at all.

 * [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com): one of the best apps for OSX out there.  You gain incredible efficiency through this app. I use it for everything from launching to quitting apps.  To emptying my trash can. To google searching. Very powerful.

 * [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com): to clear my menubar and keep things from distracting me.

 * Lastly, I use fullscreen apps all the time to help me concentrate on the task at hand.

Since I dedicated myself to this setup for my devices, I've noticed that I compulsively check things much less. Instead of the actions being driven by a subconscious urge, I now have to actively think ""Okay, I need to check my email now"" or ""I need to text this person"" or ""It is time for me to check Facebook."" This way I am in control, and not the other way around.

And because of this new mental route, I also use the search functions to launch apps more on my iPhone and iPad such as Spotlight and Alfred. Is it slower than it was before? Probably, but just by a little bit. But I gain a sense of control over my actions.

So that's my journey through Digital Minimalism. Thought I'd share with you guys! I love this community and the clarity Minimalism (both in lifestyle and artistic design) have brought me.

**TL;DR:** I understand the irony of a TL;DR in a minimalism post. Digitally minimalized my computer, tablet, and smartphone so that I've become in control of my digital life and not succumbing to compulsive subconscious urges to check everything.

I'm going to tell you how I got rid of mine (around 40 books) and even made roughly 100€ with them.

**Sorting out**

This was maybe the hardest part. I sorted my library in three categories:
**a) Keep
b) Sell
c) Gift**

**Keep**
I was only going to keep books, that I was going to read again for sure. In any other case they had lost their use for me and had to go, even if there was some sentimental value to them. What is value if you can't appreciate it? My time is rare and I have no intent to waste it, for I have 15 other new books waiting to be read.

**Sell**
I had three options for selling used books: Ebay, Flea-markets and Amazon Trade-In (or similar services).
I chose Amazon Trade-In because I knew it would get me some money/credit for it and I didn't want to to sell 20 books or so on ebay, which would take up a lot of my precious time.
Selling through Amazon Trade-In is really easy and has no costs, since Amazon pays the shipping. Just verify the ISBN-codes of your books, pack them up and give the package to the next post-office. Wait a few days and voilá your done.
[I sold 16 books and made 94,70€.](http://imgur.com/kavXL)

**Gift**
I knew the other books weren't worth any real money so I decided to gift them to somebody. Sure I could have waited for the next flea-market in spring but I wanted to get rid of the space consuming books.
So I contacted my local library, packed all in the books in an ikea-bag and gave them to the librarians. They were very nice and happy about the free books and I was happy because I now have more space and less stuff to go through when searching for one of my favorite books.

I was able to grab a robe, some shoes, and my cell phone and I got out as fast as I could (there were literally seconds to spare, the fire was massive). I lived in a beautiful old Victorian with 3 other housemates, and there was one casualty.

I will never forget the feeling of getting to safety, turning around and seeing my house ablaze, and not knowing if I would ever regain a single thing I owned. I had so much stuff, to a fault - I used to live amidst constant clutter because I was so loathed to deal with the sheer volume of *things* I had to contend with. All that, gone in a heartbeat.

It was incredible how little I cared. In a moment like that, things like your ID, your passport, your birth certificate, your debit card... those are the only things that matter. You're watching your home go up in flames, the 5 different kinds of shampoo you had in the bathroom or your excessive collection of scarves just don't matter. 

The offers for clothing, furniture, sheets, travel-sized toiletries... they were overwhelming. I outfitted myself with a backpack with 3 days worth of clothes and the little baggie the Red Cross gave me of soap and toothbrushes, and handling any more *things* was anxiety-provoking. I only wanted enough that I could keep track of everything all at once. Later that day I went back with my family and tried to salvage what I could - my room was relatively undamaged, but it's hard to think of what to grab when you only have 10 minutes to do it - my mother's constant prompts of ""are you sure you don't want this? we can always fix it"" just wore me out. I didn't want anything. I grabbed my teddy bear from when I was a baby, some clothes, my grandmother's diamond earrings, and some useful knick knacks I'd picked up on various travels. I can fit most everything I own in a car but I have no idea what to do with it. It's just stuff. Stuff without a home is pointless.

I signed a lease on a beautiful new apartment and I'll be filling it with furniture and stuff in the near future. Thankfully renter's insurance will cover everything. Starting over with little to nothing is actually quite nice.

I've thought a lot about minimalism since this happened. By definition, I'm going to have to get by on very little for a very long time. I'll never be the kind of minimalist who tries to get rid of every *thing* she can, because, well, the fire took care of that for me.

I keep reading these ""how to de-clutter your life"" blogs and it's almost nauseating how little they apply. Where are the ""I just lost everything and want to rebuild my life around the notion that I don't want or need much"" blogs? The anxiety I have over accumulating unnecessary things is almost prohibitive.

You'll probably see a lot more of me on here. To be frank, minimalism seems rather trite to me right now, but I might as well immerse myself in that kind of mindset so I can re-accumulate wisely.

Thanks for listening.

Edit: Thanks for all the great responses. I think the idea of doing a blog about this whole experience would be really cathartic and help me focus my thoughts a bit, and I love the idea of providing a resource to others who are going through similar situations. I look forward to exploring what ""minimalism"" really means to me."	t5_2r0z9	True

I would like to live in a small geodesic dome with a sleeping loft.

I am working a regular job in Babylon to save money to meet that goal.

After filing taxes, I realized that last year I ***wasted my entire earnings of $18,836***.

This year, I'm going to set aside ***at least $250*** per paycheck ($500 per month),  plus ***whatever I can make and spare on the side***, saving a total of ***at least $7000*** by the end of next year.

I'm going to ***stop spending $10 a day*** on lunch at work, and save approximately ***$2700*** in the process.

Instead, I will make sandwiches and bring fruit, along with something simple like potato salad, rice and beans, lentils or chili. Bulk food, cheap, and ***prepared well ahead of time***.

I'm going to ***avoid nonessential expensive beverages, and drink more water***.

I'm going to sweat the small things.

I'm going to buy everything I need that I can, ***USED***.

I'm going to ***refrain from purchasing unnecessary new things, that don't contribute to my desired lifestyle***.

I'm going to ***sell the things that I don't need and use***, and minimize on my lifestyle, ***again***.

I'm going to ***abstain from smoking***. It's bad for my health, and counterproductive to my goals.

I'm going to spend more time with my parents and my little sister, ***life is short***.

I'm going to spend less time ***aimlessly*** on Reddit.

I will study sustainable design, or small-scale organic farming, or read an interesting book instead.

I'm going to spend more time reading ***something that isn't displayed on an LCD***.

I'm going to ride my bicycle ***everywhere***.

&gt; what is it with people and sleeping on the floor in this subreddit???????

--

&gt;Why would anybody want to live like that? That's not minimalism at all. It's just sad. Do you never have friends or family over?
&gt;
&gt;Nothing has been gained here.

--

&gt;(In reference to someone saying they enjoy living 'like that' : You forgot to mention you're all 19.

--

&gt;Keeping all your stuff at your parents house and being too cheap/poor/stubborn to buy furniture isn't an interesting case of minimalism in my book...

--

&gt; You're poor, not minimalist.

--
&gt;I don't get it. I understand minimalism in a pragmatic way, in terms of reducing costs, complexity and clutter, but this is not about that anymore. This is about less stuff for its own sake.


----

So what is going on in this subreddit? Nowhere else on the internet dedicated to minimalists have I seen so many people who are not minimalists.

Everyone will have a different level of ""stuff"" they feel they need. And this means some homes will be more furnished than others.

But you should applaud the people who have managed to live with very little, not berate them. 

I think the problem with this subreddit is that it is not dedicated to people who practice minimalism as a lifestyle. 

We have:

1. The people who like minimal aesthetics / art. (But want to keep all their stuff / live with clutter.)
2. The home-maker moms who are trying to 'live simply', who aren't minimalists by any stretch of the imagination.
3. The people who want more money and more time, and only minimalism when they can see a financial gain.
4. Those who like to be self-sufficient, but aren't minimalists.

To be a minimalist in your lifestyle, you need to enjoy having less. It can't be some painful process you go through only when you need to save some cash or are nagged into doing. 

There is a drive many minimalists share, a freedom we feel when we have less. 


----

TL;DR:

**If you cannot understand that having less makes people happy and gives them a sense of freedom, then you are not a minimalist.**

**If minimalism and de-cluttering has brought you happiness, is it so difficult to believe that further minimalism and de-cluttering could bring someone else more happiness?**

Finally, minimalism requires you to say ""Do I need this?"" - everyone experiences this when they first de-clutter. You go around and ask yourself 'Do i need this item?'. 

When you see someone without a bed, you should not instantly berrate them, but be thankful because they are giving you the opportunity to ask a question you may not have thought of before 'Do I need my bed?'. 

That is why I will never judge someone for living more minimally than myself, because they provide inspiration and insight that I can use in my own life. "	t5_2r0z9	True

I thought about ""Hmm, what neat things can I blow this on? An oil change sounds like a good idea!""

I was taken aback. Usually I'd be thinking about gadgets or records or toys of some variety, but nope. The only thing I could think to spend the money on was an oil change. 

When I got home, I sat and looked around my room. I thought ""What could I get that would improve my life?"" and the answer wasn't obvious. In fact, the answer was nothing. 

For the first time in my life, I realized I really am not wanting for anything. 

I’ve got a new(er) car, my phone is just dandy, my guitars are 10/10, and my laptop, while a little on the old (6 years) side, does everything I need it to do just fine.

The number of things I actually want currently can be broken down to:

* Spare battery/charger for my phone ($30 on Amazon)
* A couple of records (Even then, they're not coming out for a few months)
* A CD changer ($25-30 at Goodwill)
* Some new jeans (I wanna get skinny jeans but I’ve got fat hips and thighs)

Outside of that I’m pretty well set. I’ve been blessed with a pretty good life. I have too many things, I think. I have enough to keep me happy, and in some cases more than enough. 

There's literally no one ""thing"" that I feel that would improve my life at all that I could spend this money on. In fact, *I'm still finding things I want to give away because I don't need them!*

I've learned to appreciate keeping things simple. I enjoy examining fine craftsmanship. I like figuring out my financial situation.

In that moment I have a defined goal, I don't rely on anyone else for it. I am appreciating nature and all she has to offer. I am also giving myself security. I am giving me and my family warmth in the winter at our cabin. I am also chopping the wood with my new Fiskars ax that was recommended to me through BIFL. I  am getting a workout and being frugal. 

I have started to build things as well, I find this really rewarding and comforting.

I have done this for my clothes and fridge contents. But it's something I had to think about, it wasn't prepared beforehand. I don't maintain a mental inventory of my belongings. To create this list, I had to think about the last time I opened my fridge or washed my clothes.

It just seems to me a lot of *minimalists* are creating these lists of everything they own and this, to me, is counterproductive. Is this golf? Is this about who has the lowest score? 

It seems like the inverse of consumerism. While Tom, Dick, and Sally are spending their precious time debating the merits of upgrading from a 42 to a 44 inch LCD TV, you are debating on throwing out your toothpaste and shampoo to replace them with baking soda, just to have 1 less item on your list. Time is finite, should you be spending it writing a list of the things you don't own. Because that is the subtext of these lists; ""Look at what I **don't** own.""

And then you become attached to that list, it becomes one more thing to take up time, one more thing to distract ; ""How can I make this list smaller? What else can go?"". The things on that list become *must haves* and you will carry that burden when something is damaged/lost/out of service.

1359152989.0	17a6a1	Counting is the wrong way to think about minimalism.	JackParrish	83	10	9	"Not trying to be unkind to counters, and in fact, it can be useful. Just trying to offer a practical perspective from one person who have wrestled with minimalism in a lot of contexts over the years. 

So to encourage those new to minimalism: counting is the wrong way to think about it. 

It's not that counting isn't useful. I really can be a good place to start, or a good evaluation tool to understand the reality of your current situation. But counting THINGS is, in a twisted way, just another way to be obsessed with things. 

So here's a few good rules of thumb to help: 

**Take everything that you do not find to be beautiful or useful and remove it from your space.** This probably won't get you all the way there right away, but if you really take this simple idea, and take it seriously, you'll be more than 1/2 way there. 

**Get rid of what you can immediately, and things that give you pause can be stored.** Probably 75% of your ""minimization"" can happen quickly--a few days or weeks. The other 25% of it will take some time, some thoughtfulness, and some cleverness on your part. It's okay to give it that time, because it's not about THINGS, it's about you, your life, and your space. And you have a context. 

**Counting is an interesting place to start--to take inventory. And it's a good way to end/update/evaluate. But don't use counting to try and make your life work.** This is where the ""100 things"" approach becomes pretty twisted and can go all wrong. 

Should we count all toilet paper rolls individually or as a group? What if I office out of my home and I need stamps and cables? 

Why should my amount of toilet paper affect my stamps? If I allow myself a pair of shoes, does that mean I have to throw out the socks because I had too many paperclips? 

And if I need a watch for my life does that mean I can't have my spare set of eye glasses do I need to lose my cooking flour? 

And around and around it goes, once again obsessing about things. 

**Minimalism isn't about a number.** It's about removing from your space what you do not need, and not being driven by material possessions. There's nothing wrong with having things, or even having nice things. But you ONLY want those things that are very useful or very beautiful to you. And most of the ""stuff"" we carry around is neither. We never need it, we never use it, and we don't even care about it. 

For some people, they may end up with 25 things. Others may have 900. Some of those people are writers and students, others are business owners and attorneys. And all have different contributions they make to the world around them, and different things help them to live that life and make those contributions. 

Do you read? Do you cook? Do you smoke cigars? Do you write? Do you work from home? Are you an architect? Construction? Minimalism can make your life simpler and better if you do all or any of these things, and everything else. 

I love to rock climb and camp. So I have a very simple set of gear for these activities, even though I only get to go twice a year or so. So they stay in clean and clearly tagged storage space, out of the way, and out of my mind. When I need them, I use them. And if I cease to do these things, I'll sell the gear or give it away. 

**Don't go so far that your life becomes much more ""plastic"" or expensive just because of your minimalism.** This is a twisted thing that happens to some folks. I had a good friend who paired down, like I did, but he essentially rendered his kitchen useless and just went out for food all the time. Ate fast food and restaurant food constantly. 

His kitchen was no longer useful. And it was a wickedly unhealthy choice for him, both financially and physically. 

Or the guy who runs his company and got rid of everything before he had systems to replace them (he wasn't clever). So he ended up buying and throwing away paperclips every time he needed them, or always borrowing from others around him. Or the traveler who has nothing and lives on everyone's sofa and using their things in the name of ""minimalism"". 

The fact is, as a minimalist you should still be EFFECTIVE at what you do, in your own context. You need to be self sufficient, and you must be clever when you cut along the important boundaries. Go paperless? Hell yes! But make sure you have a system to still track your important documents or else you'll find yourself sued by clients or the IRS. 

**And this wraps into the final rule of thumb: minimalism should make you BETTER at what you do, not worse.** Use it to give you BETTER focus, not less (because you're always running around unprepared). Allow it to give you a better space to live in, not force you to leech off of everyone else's space or things. Be vibrant and wise and self sufficient--just with only a minimal amount of things to BE these things.  

This isn't an excuse to hoard and keep from pairing things down. Far from it. It's just that, in practicality, it is easy to forget that minimalism is about your and your life and your space, not about an obsession with things (just doing it from the other direction). This causes a lot of people trouble, and forces them to end up spending a lot more money and worrying about things after they minimize every bit as much as they did before. 

It's not a thoughtless undertaking. In fact, you really do have to be clever and motivated to make it work. It's EASY to get hooked on the emotional pull of ""stuff"". But it is worth the effort, and you'll feel amazing when you come out the other side.

1358243238.0	16m01d	Reassessing the reddit front page through minimalism, or: understanding your dependence on reddit	Cutth	99	30	25	"Minimalism applies to everything. Or at least it should be. Our ethos has for so long been to think twice about our material possessions, but little discussion has gone on about what we commit our time to. The point in question for this discussion is reddit, and by extension, the internet. It is so easy to become drawn to the excesses of reddit, its countless subreddits, so many of which produce such little content of real personal value. Of course this is unique to each person, but that's much of the point. Take a step back and look at what really matters to you.

If you're anything like me, you've spent far more time on reddit than you would like. It's crippled my productivity and has become a [quick dopamine outlet](http://jdmoyer.com/2011/11/28/overstimulation-and-desensitization-how-civilization-affects-your-brain/) when real work elsewhere becomes to difficult. It's certainly easier to look at a picture of a kitty cat than to do homework or create art, or whatever it is you do. 

I took the popular enclaves such as pics and funny for necessities, as they were default subreddits. But one day, after some frustration, I got to thinking of how little I truly cared about what went on there, and realized that I could easily remove myself from them. So I went to my subreddit listed and purged. Slowly, it began to dwindle. With time, more and more subreddits wouldn't make the cut. After a while, I reached a satisfactory number, which is where I am today. 

This is [my front page](http://i.imgur.com/qhAqo.png), and this is my [subscriptions list](http://i.imgur.com/BfAZh.png). I don't show you this to appreciate its aesthetic value or to stroke my own minimalist ego, but to show you what works for *me*. The mentality here is that everything is a purposeful decision. A quick rundown of what's going on here:

* Compressed view means I have no thumbnail to draw my eyes, and the upvote count is obscured, meaning I must read the title and make a personal decision of whether to click the link or not before bias of upvote count is ever made.

* I'm removed from a lot of the 'essential' subreddits, yes. But I realize that I was ever only subscribed to them because of their entertainment value. I seldom took anything meaningful from them. 

* Only 10 posts per page, and 30 posts per comment page. I know I spend way too much time cycling through pages and comments, so I'm creating boundaries for myself. This is why RES is omitted, I don't want a more seamless reddit experience, I want a simple one. 

The brain is more fragile and impressionable than we understand. It’s not just the amount of furniture we surround ourselves by, but what we put in front of our eyes and what activities we spent our time and effort on. I make this post in hopes of creating a dialog , not just in this thread, but in this subreddit, on thinking about reddit and by extension, the internet in a different way – through minimalism. Do I need this? Or is it a waste of my time? Just because it isn't physical doesn't mean it doesn't affect us in significant and equal ways to physical things.

Without any regret, I sold all my comic books, got rid of a huge library of dusty paperbacks, disposed of thousands of DVDs and movies, and gave away 90% of my clothes. A glorious, great feeling.

But, then.

Look...I have 26 typewriters. That sounds excessive, and perhaps it is.  But I love them, each and every one of them. I clean them and I use them on all a rotating basis.  They are important to me.  And, I'm not selling them (though I did have two that were so beyond repair that I gave them to thrift stores early on).

So, even though I'm strictly adhering to the minimalist credo to only keep things that you use, and that are personally important to you, I have ultimately failed. I'm not actually a minimalist.

That has to be okay, I guess. My life is no longer cluttered by garbage I don't use and things I don't want. EVERYTHING I have left has a place in my life. Maybe the idea all along wasn't to be able to fit my entire life into a backpack...just to be surrounded only by the things that matter most, and those that bring me happiness.

For instance, my last lighter just ran out so I'm going to have to replace it. I have the choice of buying 50 for $0.25 each or 1 for $2.00.

My business mind wants to just buy the 50. Over a long period of time, I'll end up using 50 lighters anyway, so why not save money? The downside is that I'll have an absurd amount of lighters that I don't need just taking up space for years.

This post wasn't just meant to ask you whether you think I should buy the 50 lighters or not, but to ponder the core question of time vs space. If I just buy the one lighter, I end up spending more money (and therefore time), but if I buy in bulk my space is more cluttered.

This 869 number includes childhood photos, cakes I've made, friends and experiences from my extensive travels and global moves, house projects, pets, funny cat pictures online, etc. I've always adopted the philosophy that your photo collection should really be the ""BEST OF"" of your life. No need to save everything just because you can. The advent of digital technology has inadvertently given us the permission to essentially hoard photos because it doesn't take up visual space, but it does take up mental and emotional space. When I go through my relatively small photo album, each picture takes me back, because I pick the picture that captures the emotions I was trying to freeze for that moment. I've been on trips where I've taken scores of photos, and only end up with 2 in the end, because those 2 photos transport me back perfectly. I think if people gave purging photos a shot, and just focus on keeping those that evoke great emotions, they'd do themselves a favor. Really think of it as your ""best of"" compilation.

Our society has become so saturated with materialistic status that most people truly believe that having more stuff will make them happy. When they do get that brand new iPhone, and that top of the line 70"" LED television they wonder why they still feel so empty. 
Over the last year, I've sold what I'd say is approximately 50% of my ""stuff"". I had a move into a much smaller space and so initially it was forced. After selling many things, I began to feel an inner peace that I couldn't put my finger on at first. As time went on, more and more things went out the door as I was able to break my chains with them. Many expensive items that I held onto with white knuckles for a long time. Tonight I actually put my television on craigslist and am willing to accept an offer at probably less than what I could get for it if I really tried. The reason being that it is unnecessary! I have never in my life been one to sit in front of a tv and watch. My girlfriend and I watch a movie maybe once a week. Not enough to justify having this thing sitting around. I'm actually looking forward to getting it out of here and freeing up the space. 
I've discovered many things after getting rid of time wasters. I've taken up shooting and greatly enjoy it. I've found that I have more money to put into my motorcycle which is a passion of mine. I've begun to read books for the first time since high school. 
I feel bad for those out there who are still mentally chained to their possessions. I could now fit everything I own into one pickup truck bed and it's a great feeling. I've not felt a greater sense of peace and well being in my life. 
I greatly enjoy reading other's stories and ideas in this subreddit! Thanks for reading :)

EDIT: Allow me to clarify something for those who don't seem to be getting what I'm saying. This is not something that I started with by saying or thinking ""I want to be a minimalist lolz!"". This is something that I started long ago when I found that I like things simple and clean. I had never even heard of ""minimalism"" until I made a reddit account about a year ago and found this subreddit.  I don't believe that anyone can become a ""minimalist"" by actively practicing it or taking other people's advice. This is something that is grown into and is more of an awakening (if you will) than anything. I'm not getting rid of possessions in order to make myself happy. I'm simply finding that as I get rid of things I am becoming naturally more happy. That is what this post is about. Not preaching to anyone, telling anyone what to do, keep, get rid of or throw away. I don't care what others do. What your house and living space looks like is your business. I am sharing my experiences, so please keep your slanted naysaying drivel in another thread if you were considering posting it. "	t5_2r0z9	True

All things that would allow us to get by with fewer articles of clothing and be comfortable in all kinds of weather. The problem is, it's ugly. Most of it is plastered with logos and multicolored - not so great for people with minimalist aesthetics. 

A little background: I recently changed jobs and now spend 80% of my workday outside. The need for clothes that protect me from the sun and wick away moisture quickly became apparent, and I've been trying to find something more suitable than the black t shirts and jeans that comprise most of my wardrobe. I've had a black [Marmot](http://marmot.com) jacket for years that I love, and am tempted to buy a couple of their [UPF shirts](http://marmot.com/products/windridge_ls?p=216,132,306,161&amp;ft=306-161), but I don't like feeling like a walking advertisement. Any ideas on finding clothing that can handle the elements but look as simple as possible?

TLDR: Looking for athletic clothes with no logos, and maybe you should be too.

I've been visiting this sub-reddit for a couple of months now, and this idea has been germinating in my head for a year or so, only coming to a greater development as I started thinking about minimalism.

One of the over-riding themes in this sub-reddit is the removal of extraneous material for a clearer and more concise lifestyle. The impact on world-view is also discussed.

It makes me think about the nature of innovation, and how it is most readily fostered when someone has a boundary to circumvent or push through. When you are challenged, you find a way to beat the challenege.

In some ways I look at minimalism as a creative lifestyle challenge: it forces you to do what you did before, but with less. Clothes get re-purposed, desk space becomes clean for greater productivity; unused items go to people who may use them better (or just clutter their own lives, but that's their journey).

This is just a thought for those who struggle to find the right balance: sometimes it's about perspective. You're not removing options from your life, you're setting up artificial barriers to foster a greater, more creative use of what you *do* have. 

Innovation occurs when a human wants an easier way to do something: by making these initial leaps into restricting your lifestyle, you may end up forcing ideas out of yourself you never knew you could have."	t5_2r0z9	True

**The American Tourist and Mexican Fisherman**

An American tourist was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.

Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The tourist complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.

The Mexican replied, ""Only a little while.""

The tourist then asked, ""Why didn't you stay out longer and catch more fish?""

The Mexican said, ""With this I have more than enough to support my family's needs.""

The tourist then asked, ""But what do you do with the rest of your time?""

The Mexican fisherman said, ""I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life.""

The tourist scoffed, "" I can help you. You should spend more time fishing; and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat: With the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats. Eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor; eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then Los Angeles and eventually New York where you could run your ever-expanding enterprise.""

The Mexican fisherman asked, ""But, how long will this all take?""

The tourist replied, ""15 to 20 years.""

""But what then?"" asked the Mexican.

The tourist laughed and said, ""That's the best part. When the time is right you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.""

""Millions?...Then what?""

The American said, ""Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.""

I've been striving for a minimalistic lifestyle for the past 6 months or so. My main focus has been clothes, clothes, clothes! I'm a (recovering) discount shopper and could easily spend hours pouring through rows and rows of discount off-season clothes that I didn't need. A couple of years ago I started losing weight, which required me to get new clothes that actually fit every 6 months or so.

Now for the success I'm so proud to share with you. I realized that my summer shorts from last year no longer fit. Off I went in search of new shorts. When I stumbled upon the multitude of discount racks, I had absolutely no desire to browse. I quickly found the shorts section and grabbed a few in denim and neutral colors to try on. I ended up buying one pair of denim shorts and one pair of neutral colored shorts. Last year me would have STILL been at the mall trying things on!

I found myself thinking critically about each pair of pants as I tried them on.

* Do I have shirts that go with this?

* Is it a comfortable fit?

* Is it something I would buy at full price or do I just like it because it's cheap?

Leaving the store, I realized just how much my consumption habits have changed in the past few months because of my efforts to reduce clutter in my life. I'm curious to know if any of you have had moments like this, where you would hardly recognize your former self. In what area of life have you changed the most?"	t5_2r0z9	True

While it is sometimes hard to explain my minimalism to my consumerist peers, I like to make a point of it. Not a preachy or critical point, either, but just a general openness about my lifestyle that informs others that there is another way, and that it is liberating and fulfilling. I enjoy my modest life, and would love it to be more socially acceptable (for young women especially) to adopt a simple lifestyle. Most people I meet assume that because I am a female 20-something, I spend a load of time at the mall, or that I have a 40+ pair shoe collection, or that my idea of a good time is picking out useless pieces of shitty decor to cram into some over-sized apartment somewhere. In reality, I feel no shame in showing up to a social event wearing seen-before items from my limited wardrobe. I enjoy the creativity it takes to style myself with my limited collection of apparel. I don't even carry a purse.

I hope that other women will also step out of their (nearly-empty and well organized) closets and be open about their minimalism in the near future. Maybe together we can break the stigma of wearing the same dress to two different formal events in the same year (I only have one, and it works for *everything*). We might just inspire a generation and turn the consumer culture around. Maybe if people stopped buying so much shit, we would have more time to examine more meaningful things. Imagine if everyone spent the hours they used to take up with shopping volunteering every week, or making art, or reading inspiring works. The culture would be richer for it, and our conversations would be filled with more commentary on the latest from our favorite authors/artists/social movement leaders, and less about the new outfits we bought last week.

1345660928.0	yng03	A personal account: from materialist to minimalist, and moving from USA&gt;Nicaragua	beingproductive	75	15	25	"Hello all, I wanted to give a big thank you to everyone who contributes to this subreddit. You've helped me immensely in one of the great transformational events of my 24 years on this earth. 

One day I looked around and discovered to my horror that despite having moved across the US just two years ago with only the things I could carry on a plane, I had somehow amassed an entire house full of CRAP. A big change was in order and conveniently an opportunity presented itself to move to Nicaragua.

The move could have been traumatic for a number of reasons, not least of which being the need to once again purge myself of the many comfy things I had surrounded myself with. Many of the posts here on r/minimalism helped me put things in perspective, better understanding myself and why I felt the need to accumulate things, and identifying those things that I really could not live without.

As many others have said, my books were the hardest things to part with. I had amassed literally hundreds in just a two year period. To add to the anxiety I discovered I hadn't begun to read even half of them. Worse yet, many still had price tags on them and I began keeping a running total of just how much money I was throwing away. 

With about a month left until departure, I began one morning with the pledge that I would whittle down my three bookshelves into just one by the end of that day. Success. A few days later, half again. And so this process continued until I had my most precious 20 books left - still far too large a number. I actually waited until just hours before leaving for the airport to decide on the final 10 books I would be taking with me. 

As for the rest of my STUFF, I donated most, sold some books to used book stores and sold many of the higher end items on craigslist/ebay. Don't let anyone fool you. It is NOT an easy process. The important thing for me was to consider the end result, the freedom I so desired, and examining the steps necessary to make that happen. Making lists is very important here.

And I'm finally here in Managua! Time and time again you hear people say that they don't miss any of the stuff they left behind. Well I'm telling you it again because it's true! The freedom I feel in being able to fit everything I own in a backpack/dufflebag is unlike any I had while living a domestic life in the states. I'm currently staying with a friend, but will soon be moving into a hostel in the city for a few months. I look forward to the luxury of minimalism inherent in that environment. Being able to actually speak English with some folks is an added bonus =)

**What I brought with me:** [(a picture)](http://i.imgur.com/5TXKg.jpg)

* Nikon D7000 DSLR camera (thinking about selling this as it is very large and cumbersome)
* 13"" Macbook Pro (now wishing I had bought a MB Air instead)
* 1 TB external harddrive (size of my wallet)
* 10 books (still far too many IMO)
* 1 set of hair/beard clippers
* 4 pairs of shoes (again, still too many. 1 casual, 1 running, 1 basketball, sandals)
* 2 sweaters/sweatshirts
* 2 long button up shirts (white/black)
* 2 long pants
* 4 shorts (dark, light, running, comfy)
* 7 tshirts (probably still too many)
* 1 undershirt
* 5 underwear
* 5 pairs of socks

**I actually had about 40-50% more clothes than this about a half hour ago. In creating this thread and taking stock I realized I still had huge excesses - so my things have been pared down once again. Perfect example of why you should take stock (or literally make a list) of your stuff and figure out just what you need!**

**A few lessons this ordeal has taught me:**

* I didn't actually NEED even a fraction of the things I owned, or rather the things that owned ME
* The biggest reason we accumulate things is the PERCEIVED sense of security they bring us. This thing that starts out as security breeds a little monster called complacency. For me, this comfort has been the most detrimental force in hindering personal growth.
* These events which are cleverly disguised as adversity are actually OPPORTUNITY for personal growth. When faced with a situation you've never encountered and left to your own devices, you can only learn new skills to adapt. Growth.
* Stop letting fear/anxiety dictate your actions. Fear of moving to another country. Fear of getting rid of ""things"". Fear of certain social situations.
* PUSH THE ENVELOPE.  It's all the same. (Generally), fear/anxiety is a great indicator that what you're witnessing is a HUGE opportunity for self growth.
* Don't skimp on quality. You'll regret it later when you have to replace that thing you got at WalMart for that great Chinese-manufactured price (obv. there are exceptions).
* You don't need the absolute biggest, brightest, clearest, lightest, most beautiful of EVERYTHING. It took me a month to figure out which laptop to buy because I just HAD to know which model best suited some bs list of my predetermined ""needs"". I wasn't satisfied with the stock Macbook, but instead installed extra RAM and a new SSD hard drive. All told, I spent over $1400!! In the end I'm left wishing I had the less powerful and smaller Macbook Air! (I know it's a wonderful device and I really do love my computer, what I'm attempting to say is despite all of the research and fretting about every technical specification to ensure my computer was absolutely state of the art, I managed to overlook the most important detail, portability).
* RENT FURNISHED. I can't tell you untold hundreds of dollars worth of stuff (furniture, dishes, random furnishings) I either donated or lost my ass on in yard sales/craigslist sales - and most of the things were thrift store finds! Factor in the time and effort it took to sell everything, and you get my drift.
*Don't stop at decluttering just material things! When I purchased my new computer and had to transfer everything from the old one, I got rid of maybe HALF of my files. Music I never listen to, pictures I never care to look at again, random outdated documents, you name it. In all I decided I didn't need maybe 100GB worth of stuff. Strangely, this was more gratifying than almost any other part of this whole process.

Parting notes: If myself and countless other people can do this, so can you! It doesn't have to be as extreme as paring everything down to one bag and moving to a foreign country, but I think it's important for our physical and emotional health to really sit and ask yourself how much your material possessions are owning you. So long and happy purging, from Nicaragua! Or eh.. adios!

It's fine only keeping what you need in the short-term if you can easily go and buy something as soon as the need arises. This seems to be a kind of outsourcing, and you pay dearly for it by having to buy and resell at a loss, maybe several times. Or maybe you rely on other people to hold on to these things so you can borrow them.

Something like the ""3 month rule"" is OK for unimportant items. But there are many times I've needed something months or years after I last used it. That said I do have a lot of novelty or obsolete items that I will probably never touch again. I would probably be happy with a ""3 year rule""."	t5_2r0z9	True

1365709968.0	1c5mq0	Backpacking Introduced me to Minimalism	efdelcam	63	4	20	"I’ve always gone camping with my family since I was a kid, it wasn’t until I was about 15 that I started getting interested in backpacking. The first time I went I was very green; I didn’t make the rookie mistake of bringing way too much stuff or anything. Really I was just unprepared. I didn’t have a sleeping pad, so I was fairly cold sleeping on the ground. I didn’t want to carry my heavy tent so I shared a two person tent with my sister and her boyfriend. None of us slept well. We didn’t go very far, only really an overnight trip. But I loved it. 
When I moved to College I was very interested in going fairly light. At the time I was obsessed with the movie “Into the Wild” and I had ideals of hitchhiking and travelling with a backpack, but I was far too young and afraid to do any of those things yet. I determined to pack only what fit into my little rav-4 car, and take nothing more with me to College. This plan worked except for my bike. I had a lot less crap then my roommate, only about 4 pairs of jeans.  Some shorts, maybe 12 shirts, tons of crappy cotton underwear and socks that needed constant replacing.  I had a houseplant, which I still like having, to help with air quality. And A guitar, skateboard, skim- board, all of which I never used.  

By the end of my freshman year I was moving into DNR housing for a summer job in Wisconsin, and had to take a little less stuff so that I could pack my co-workers stuff with us.  I left my bike in storage at school. I took less clothes, less pens, less knickknacks, I got rid of my posters. After my summer job I had a lot of extra spending money. Of course I blew about half of this on clothes, I bought nail polish in about 10 colors, a studded belt, more jeans, a leather coat, and tons of Starbucks, a stand up paddle board, a surfboard, an electric guitar and amp. Most of this stuff I had quickly grown tired of, and really was just a waste of money.  At school that year I changed a lot. I got very into backpacking and outdoor sports. I tried surfing but never had the time and it proved to be very dangerous alone in Northern Michigan. I experimented with drugs and cut my long hair into a Mohawk, died it black, and stopped showering daily. It was a strange time in my life. 
When I started dating my boyfriend we were talking about moving into a tent for the summer and living that way indefinitely.  We packed everything we owned into my car. We sold our bikes, he sold his motorcycle and his car. We got rid of anything we didn’t need. I sold my laptop, and so did he and we bought a small net- book to share.  I sold my tent since we shared one. I bought expensive Patagonia underwear and Smartwool socks which I still have and work great two years later, they are quick drying so I can wash them in a sink and hang them  dry. I will never use cotton underwear again. And we departed for our adventure in Flagstaff AZ. He worked for an environmental firm during the day and I did various odd jobs to make some money.  At night we slept in a tent in the national forest.  By the end of the summer we had saved enough money to buy our Van. This is by far the best purchase we have ever made together. It cost us $3,800 and we’ve lived in it, used it to travel, and used to for a delivery job.  We bought a mattress, built a frame, and moved into the van. If felt like luxury after living in the tent for two months. 

At the end of the summer we went on a backpacking trip at Sequoia National Park. We ended up taking a lot of heavy and unnecessary stuff. Chaz brought a knife that weighed about 2 lbs, which we didn’t even use. My sleeping pad was an ancient Thermarest that weighed about a pound and leaked. We brought winter sleeping bags which were too heavy and way too warm.  The trip was a blast but we were very fatigued from hiking with the extra weight. 

Our next trip a few weeks later was in Yellowstone.  We had both bought new lighter-weight packs and sold our old packs. We used bivy sacks this time with a thin sleeping-bag liner instead of a tent and sleeping bag. It was too light, definitely a mistake. It was too cold and we froze all night and cut our trip short. We returned the expensive bivies to REI. 

Our next trip was an epic two-month adventure in Australia and New Zealand.  We did a stellar job packing this time. We had a lighter weight tent. Light packs and sleeping pads, and sleeping bags for summer weather. We carried on our packs on the plane and they weighed less than 20 lbs. The clothes I packed were 1 pair of zip-off pants, 3 pairs of underwear, 2 bras, 1 quick dry t-shirt, 1 sun shirt, 1 pair of shoes, 1 pair of ultralight sandals, 3 pairs of socks, rain pants, rain jacket, a wool long sleeve shirt, and a sunhat and bandanna. On the trip we carried as much as 3 liters of water each at times while hitch hiking. The trip was amazing.  If you want to hear more details check out my blog: minimalistvagrant.blogspot.com.  We also took disk golf disks which we intended to use as plates or for playing, we gave these away since we found almost no disk-golf courses in Australia. We also brought a water filter which we never used, although I liked knowing it was there if we needed it. We also brought a Jetboil camp stove and mugs for eating out of. I ended up getting rid of my cup since I never used it. We hardly used the Jetboil because it took us about half the trip before we found fuel for it. But we did cook a lot of ramen in it in the last few weeks. We took along our netbook, which at the time made sense because it was before most people had smartphones. We used the internet at McDonalds and at Hostels when we stayed there. We have sense replaced our camera, I-pod, and Netbook with smartphones when we go on trips and this saves tons of weight and is really useful for navigation, communication, photos, etc. 

The most recent trip we have taken we went to Puerto Rico for 18 days. This was our lightest trip yet. We had a base pack weight of about 9lbs. Our sleeping bags proved to be useless since it was so hot. And our Jetboil was also useless since you cannot buy fuel for it anywhere in PR.  I can’t say that PR was our favorite trip but it was very inexpensive. We were able to camp most nights and met a lot of locals who gave us rides and told us what we should see. 

Packing and living out of a bag for weeks on end is such a great experience. I love the mobility and self sufficiency. We are able to just walk and if we get somewhere nice camp there. I don’t want to go total vagabond and live like that permanently. But I like taking long trips that way. Our next trip is going to be a cross country bicycle tour from Michigan to Vancouver this summer.  Packing light has taught me to eliminate the unnecessary in my everyday life as well. I used to have a thick bulky Volcom Stone wallet that couldn’t fit in my pocket. Now I use a slim wallet. I used to have decorative key chains, but ultralight hiking has taught me the true cost and inconvenience of unnecessary weight. I now have only my car key on a small carabineer. I used to have about ten pairs of pants. Now I use about two. I’m not saying this is the lifestyle for everyone. But I love it. And by trimming my unnecessary possessions I am able to go on trips all the time. By living in a van and not paying rent or utilities I have almost my whole paycheck to spend on things I want to do. I think collecting experiences is way more valuable than physical objects. I may not live like this forever. But I think If I settle down it will be in a small off the grid cabin, not in a white picket fence suburb. I hope you enjoyed my story.

1343787167.0	xhf3j	Something finally clicked today.		69	11	26	"So, /r/minimalism, I've been lurking here for quite awhile. A few months ago I realized that damnit, I have a lot of shit. I suck at cleaning, so it's messy. But getting rid of it...well, that just wasn't going to happen.

So I started reading. And slowly I began tossing this and that. Getting rid of 50 million dishes when I live alone and hate having people over, books I really don't care about (not to be confused with books I care for very much), that sort of thing. I eventually tackled my dragon, my closet -- I probably have more clothing now than most, if not all of you when you started, but it's still 5-6 large trashbags less than what I started with (I love clothes, and it's not like I'm just wearing the same things over and over again -- I cycle through them *all*). And I still have too much **stuff.**

But now I'm preparing to move to a studio apartment, and one that I can afford will probably be all of 400 sq ft. Maybe 500, if I'm lucky. So I need to get rid of *more.*

And today at work, I don't know what did it exactly, but suddenly I couldn't wait to come home and purge (the getting-rid-of-stuff kind, not the puking kind, though I figure y'all know that). 

And today, I went through my biggest trouble spot -- my giant plastic bins of scrap fabric for sewing. And I said to myself, no more than one plastic bin. And suddenly, something clicked -- I didn't even fill the bin, and what's in there is loosely tossed instead of tightly packed like every single other time I've tried paring down. I just did not need most of that. It meant nothing. I would not, and will not, miss it.

And today, I finally found the energy to dump my giant box of papers and sort through them.

And today, for the first time, I think I actually have more drawers and shelves and bins than I do physical *things.*

Now, I am still very very far from the rest of you. I will never be a minimalist, and I never want to be. It would not be 'peaceful' or 'comfortable' for me (I don't like bare spaces or wide open spaces). But I can safely say I had way, way too much, and I think I finally have a manageable, reasonable amount of things, and I'm not even finished yet.

So, thanks /r/minimalism. I'm not sure why it clicked today, or what finally set me off, but I appreciate your being here for me to read and soak in."	t5_2r0z9	True

Feels good!	notamypond	68	13	8	"I realized that I had to do something as soon  as I came home from college for the summer with a jumbo space bag filled with clothes (of which I used about 5% of)... which wasn't even *half* of what I had back at home. I couldn't even unpack my clothes when I got back because nothing else could fit in my dresser! 

Today, a few days' worth of planning and scrolling through this subreddit, I ended up going through everything. I ended up  donating/tossing over half of what I owned, I didn't even wear most of it! A lot of it was from 8th grade or high school. (Embarrassing, yes, I know. I've been bad at getting rid of things. But I'm getting better, starting toda.) Here's what I ended up donating:

http://i.imgur.com/8fuMJ.jpg
Three bags of clothes, one bag of shoes.

The rest of my plan includes going through the clothes that made the cut again to make sure that I will actually *wear* them (and won't just take up space). I will also be throwing out all the miscellaneous clutter I've been accumulating for years.

This is fun, and *so* relieving. Why didn't I start sooner?

1375700185.0	1jqewb	A lesson from Pál Erdős	dionyziz	62	5	2	"*From the book [The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdos and the Search for Mathematical Truth](http://www.amazon.com/The-Man-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061):*

At five foot six, 130 pounds, [Pál Erdős](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) had the wizened, cadaverous look of a drug addict. His hair was white, and corkscrew-shaped whiskers shot out at odd angles from his face. He usually wore a gray pin-striped jacket, dark trousers, a red or mustard shirt or pajama top, and sandals or peculiar pockmarked Hungarian leather shoes, made especially for his flat feet and weak tendons. His whole wardrobe fit into his one small suitcase, with plenty of room left for his dinosaur of a radio. He had so few clothes that his hosts found themselves washing his socks and underwear several times a week. ""He could buy more,"" one of his colleagues said, ""or he could wash them himself. I mean, it takes zero IQ to learn how to operate a washing machine."" But if it wasn't mathematics, Erdos wouldn't be bothered. ""Some French socialist said that private property was theft,"" Erdos recalled. ""I say that private property is a nuisance.""

The only possessions that mattered to him were his mathematical notebooks. He always carried one around with him, so that he could record his mathematical insights on a moment's notice. ""Erdos came to my twins' bar mitzvah, notebook in hand,"" said Peter Winkler, a colleague of Graham's at AT&amp;T. ""He also brought gifts for my children -he loved kids- and behaved himself very well. But my mother-in-law tried to throw him out. She thought he was some guy who wandered in off the street, in a rumpled suit, carrying a pad under his arm. It is entirely possible that he proved a theorem or two during the ceremony.""

What little money Erdos received in stipends or lecture fees he gave away to relatives, colleagues, students, and strangers. He could not pass a homeless person without giving him money. ""In the early 1960s, when I was a student at University College London,"" recalled D. G. Larman, ""Erdos came to visit us for a year. After collecting his first month's salary he was accosted by a beggar on Euston station, asking for the price of a cup of tea. Erdos removed a small amount from the pay packet to cover his own frugal needs and gave the remainder to the beggar."" In 1984 he won the prestigious Wolf Prize, the most lucrative award in mathematics. He contributed most of the $50,000 he received to a scholarship in Israel he established in the name of his parents. ""I kept only seven hundred and twenty dollars,"" Erdos said, ""and I remember someone commenting that for me even that was a lot of money to keep."" Whenever Erdos learned of a good cause -a struggling classical music radio station, a fledgling Native American movement, a camp for wayward boys- he promptly made a small donation. ""He's been gone a year,"" said Graham, ""and I'm still getting mail from organizations he gave donations to. Today I got a postcard from an Israeli girls' home.""

In the late 1980s Erdos heard of a promising high school student named Glen Whitney who wanted to study mathematics at Harvard but was a little short of the tuition. Erdos arranged to see him and, convinced of the young man's talent, lent him $1,000. He asked Whitney to pay him back only when it would not cause financial strain. A decade later Graham heard from Whitney, who at last had the money to repay Erdos. ""Did Erdos expect me to pay interest?"" Whitney wondered. ""What should I do?"" he asked Graham. Graham talked to Erdos. ""Tell him,"" Erdos said, ""to do with the thousand dollars what I did.""

BRE4KER	93	35	29	"I've recently found a subreddit called [six word stories](http://www.reddit.com/r/sixwordstories/) and realized Minimalism enthusiast would appreciate it too. It is based on the idea of a story written by Ernest Hemmingway. It reads:

""For sale: baby shoes, never worn.""

Hemmingway later said it was one of his best works.

I think the idea of condensing a story down to six words forces a writer to strip away all the unimportant words until there is just the pure idea nugget left.

And so I've challenged myself to write a six word story for each genre. I'd like to share them with you.

Here is an example. Science fiction genre:

1372110890.0	1gzw09	Feelings: slightly confused, definitely uncomfortable (slightly edited x-post from /declutter)	OneLittleBunny	60	5	48	"So, let me preface this by saying: I grew up in IKEA-country. The message from all IKEA-commercials ever was always ""can't fit everything into your cupboards? BUY MOAR STORAGE"" rather than ""get rid of some stuff"". Also, there were all the ""you need more stuff""-commercials from all the other stores.

The past few days I've been decluttering and (mostly) reorganizing my kitchen, office and clothes, and well.. I apparently don't have enough stuff anymore..

I now have several shelves and drawers that are either empty or almost empty. I somewhat expected it in my closet (built for two), but my kitchen has always been too small for me.

These empty drawers are freaking my IKEA-ridden brain out because I feel like there has to be a better use for them than just being empty. Like I'm wasting precious space in my apartment because I have all this storage with nothing in it, you know?

I don't need/want more stuff, I just feel kinda stupid storing this much *air*. All closets/drawers in the IKEA commercials were always organized-but-full, and here I am, with all of my empty storage..

I'm currently trying to condense a full size Liatorp bookshelf into 2.5 Rast-drawers and a 2ft bookshelf to deal with the empty office space, but;

I know that ""have to have"" is a bit taboo here, but I have a personal netbook PLUS a work laptop and so does my wife.

I have clothes, winter and summer, and coats.

I have kitchen utensils and pots and pans and dishes to serve 10; I have cars that require maintenance so I have tools and parts.

I have a lawn to mow, and a pool to clean, a house to wash.

I read about getting rid of it all, and see people posting pictures claiming it is ""everything I own""...they don't make a camera lens wide enough to capture just the basics that I ""have to have"".

Although I admit to having a long way to go, I just can't imagine a time when there wont still be a pretty hefty pile.

Kortheo	64	11	19	"Now, I know my title might make it sound as if I'm about to give a criticism of minimalism, but that's not what I'm doing. I think minimalism is a positive part of my life.

What I've noticed, however, is that minimalism has put me in a mindset of always being critical of all my possessions. Do I really need this? Could this be replaced with something simpler? What's my reason for owning that? etc

This may be partially or primarily just a function of my psychology: I have a tendency to be a perfectionist, so I tend to feel like I need to be as minimal as possible to meet my goals. I'll stress out about not being minimal enough, about having things I don't really need. In doing so, my focus is often about monitoring what I own or purchase and making sure I'm continuing to be minimalist.

For example, when it does come time for me to buy something, I'll put in tons of effort to make sure it's the perfect item for the job. Take clothing: I only want to buy that one perfect pair of jeans, so I'll spend tons of time trying to find that perfect pair, because I really don't want to own more than one. But in doing this, I'm just spending a lot of time focusing on Stuff, which is antithetical to the goals of minimalism, at least to a certain degree.

They were stoked beyond life. I totally made their day and made mine! :) It was a win-win for everyone, and I cleared up some more space.

I don't have a massive accumulation of stuff but I live in a house with my parents who are borderline hoarders. When I get out on my own I intend to have as little crap as possible.

Anyway, as my perspective changes, I start to realize how infatuated our society is with stuff. In my mind there are useful things, and then there's just junk. This idea that people frequently go to malls or other stores to go 'shopping' is starting to sicken me. There's a difference between going to the store to buy something you need and 'shopping' trips where people go to stores not even with anything particular in mind. They just go to peruse and buy junk that catches their eye. They probably didn't even think they 'needed' it before they saw it in the store. This upsets me.

The other day I was watching Pawn Stars and it dawned on me how ridiculous the idea of collector's items being valuable is. People are affixing these insane and completely unjustified values to items because they once belonged to a certain person or perhaps only a few of them were made. These people quite literally enjoy just having stuff for the sake of having it. Many serious collectors have collections of mint items that they'll never even use, it just sits around so they can look at it. Sure, such items would have a 'neat' quality to them, but it makes me wonder what sort of society we live in where a collected might drop $1000 on some random piece of junk that is completely non-functional (because it would devalue the item to use it) while in other parts of their own country people are surely starving (or other parts of the world people are dying).

Then there's a newspaper ad I saw the other day. It was for some store and it had a big section called ""DOORBUSTERS"" as in 'these deals are so good you'll come bust down the door the moment the store opens'. The items they were advertising just made me think 'who the hell needs that stuff' and 'what idiot actually thinks these are worthy of the term 'doorbusters''? This brought back memories of a Walmart employee that was actually trampled to death a few years back (http://nyti.ms/shJqF6) because a junk-hungry mob stampeded through the doors as soon as the store opened so they could get the deals.

How is something like that not a wake-up call that we've let the fetishism of stuff get completely out of control? Someone actually died for no reason other than a bunch of people wanted a good deal on some shit that's probably been thrown out by now. This is genuinely disgusting.

1327157507.0	oq8dl	1 bag; 4 months; a few thoughts on my minimalist life in a suitcase	twelvis	62	10	37	"So I've been living out of 1 medium-sized rolling bag for 4 months now traveling through East Asia. Not once have I ever thought ""man I wished I had X that I left at my parents place."" I don't have any permanent home anymore since I got rid of most of my stuff before leaving, so my parents were kind enough to let me keep a few things at their place.

In fact, I took too many clothes that I never got good use out of (i.e., fancy shirts, slacks). In fact, I'm wondering how to get rid of the last few things I didn't take with me. Next time, I want to take just one small (30 L) backpack.

If I needed something like toiletries, I just bought them. When my pair of jeans got destroyed (drunken martial arts practice in Japan), I just got another pair. There was no need for backups. I rented temporary housing or stayed with friends/Couchsurfers. I lived very deliberately and only bought what I needed when I needed it. In fact, I spent way less money ""traveling"" than I ever did ""at home"" even though I was in some of the most expensive places in the world (e.g., Tokyo and Hong Kong). I learned to be happy living in Asian shoe box-sized apartments, some less than 300 sq ft.

This trip has solidified my belief that minimalism is a precursor to happiness; none of this would be possible (for me anyway) without adopting minimalist beliefs. If you cannot learn to be happy with a little, you will always feel unsatisfied with what you have and will never have the resources to obtain/experience what you really want. I really see how possessions own a person now; they require huge amounts of time and money that one simply cannot understand until you begin to give things up. 

I hope everyone in this subreddit can get the feeling of true freedom and satisfaction from minimalism one way or another at some point. Owning physical things actually makes me unhappy now as I feel burdened and restricted by them. Only people, places, and food make me truly happy, and I have more than enough resources to obtain those.

I just wanted to thank you for giving inspiration, asking thought provoking questions and writing merciless manifests. With your guiding I searched for the right answers and started to focus every part of my life and revoke clutter, blind consumerism and time consuming but unnecessary habits. First went all the stuff that I horded but never used anymore: Clothes I did not love, books I would never read again, electronics that filled my drawers, I sold even a big unnecessary cupboard. After that and with a nudge by many minimalism- or minimalism-related-posts (like from /r/simpleliving) I started to expand the minimalism-theory onto my everyday life. Focus on what is important to you, remove everything else - This was my mantra. It worked. It helped. I am a happier person now.
I changed from a young man without a goal and still too much to do, to someone with a purpose and, thanks to you, the means to follow it through. You taught me that time is more precious than money and money should only be a mean not a goal. I often wish that everyone knew this. We would live in a better world.

So thank you and keep questioning what you spend your life on but remember that minimalism too should not be the goal but a tool."	t5_2r0z9	True

I was studying for an exam and was reminded of this concept that might be of interest to you - the 5Ss. 

1. Sort/segregate - Keep what is needed &amp; remove everything else; when in doubt, throw it out. Remove identified non-value items to make space and improve work flow. 

2. Simplify/straighten - Arrange environment to improve work flow and reduce wasted motion. Consider long-run &amp; short-run ergonomic issues. 

3. Shine/sweep - Clean daily; eliminate all forms of dirt, contamination &amp; clutter. 

4. Standardize - Remove variations by developing standard operations/activities; this promotes cost reduction and increased efficiency. 

5. Sustain/self-discipline - Review periodically to recognize efforts and to motivate to sustain progress.

**General purpose questions and definitions**

**Q:** What is minimalism?

A word that means, ""using the concept of *less*.""

**Q:** Are there requirements to be a ""minimalist?""

There aren't any requirements, really. Minimalism isn't some card-carrying club; it's just the concept of ""being content with your life"" through the concept of *less.* You decide what that concept means in execution.

**Q:** How do I make it work for my life?

Find what makes your life worth living and focus on that, and remove whatever stands in your way of doing so.

**Q:** What kinds of minimalism are there?

* Reducing your possessions, or ""material minimalism."" 
* Removing your commitments and managing your time
* Downsizing your technology, or ""digital minimalism.""
* Focusing your mind, or ""mental minimalism.""
* Reducing visual elements, or ""aesthetic minimalism.""
* And infinitely more. Look below for tips on how to achieve some of these.

**Q:** What is the point of minimalism?

To reconsider what we think is important to us, to make sure we never lose focus on that, and to remove the barriers between us and what we love. To understand ourselves and those around us. To get rid of the cruft. To make moving and traveling easier. To increase efficiency. To remove redundancy. To beautify, enhance, highlight. To enlighten. To be content with our lives.

**Q:** What about the [100 Things Challenge](http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/)? What about those guys who [own 15 things](http://andrewhy.de/extreme-minimalism/)? Is minimalism supposed to be followed like [Leo Babauta](http://mnmlist.com/), [The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com/), or some specific r/Minimalism contributor?

It can be. Those are examples of ways to apply minimalism to your life. However, beware of holding yourself up to standards that may not fit your lifestyle and mindset. Be liberal in changing these to make it work for you.

**Advice and tips for common questions**

**Q:** Where do I start if I want material minimalism?

It doesn't matter where you start, and it doesn't matter how long it takes you. Do not be overwhelmed. Be mindful of your possessions. Make your elimination mean something, so you remember it.

Donate as much as you can, and throw away what you must. Keep a mental tally of the things you use and remove what you don't. Place stickers on your items, and remove the stickers when you use something to keep track. Focus on one aspect of your life at a time - gadgets, clothes, bathroom items, the junk drawer, the storage attic, and so on. Don't be too scared of throwing away too much or making mistakes. If you're not sure if you can live without something, loan it to a friend or put it in the closet for a period of time.

**Q:** How do I maintain a state of material minimalism?

If you're continually having to purge, your problem isn't your stuff, it's your habits. Focus on what you're bringing into your possessions, and stop your buying impulses. Don't let your garbage can do your minimalism for you. 

Implement a ""one in, two out"" rule to attach a larger price to what you buy, or institute an absolute stop to any new purchases for a while. Pay for things with cash. Think about your ""needs"" versus your ""wants"" and be clear about the distinction. Is it your life's focus and passion, or is it just a minor want? To help with wants, only allow yourself to buy things after they've been on a ""I want this"" list for a month.

**Q:** Can I still have hobbies if I'm material minimalist? What about hobbies that require a lot of stuff?

Of course to both. However, consider its necessity to your wellbeing and how it correlates to the extra burden needed to deal with the extra equipment. Avoid new hobbies that require lots of new purchases until you've already made it [part of your life](http://mnmlist.com/gear/).

**Q:** Can [blank] be considered minimalist?

With any number of viewpoints, probably. But you also don't have to look to this subreddit for validation!

**Q:** Where do I start if I want mental minimalism?

Important: If you suspect you or a someone you know has depression or suicidal thoughts, don't bother with any of this; get professional help *now.* The mind is not something to mess with.

That said, concentration is key to understanding how to use your mind. Learn to listen to your mind. Learn to focus properly and learn to wield your attention; it can be a very powerful tool if tuned correctly. [Take up meditation](http://www.reddit.com/r/meditation/help/faqs/meditation), and learn [relaxation techniques](http://www.artofliving.org/us-en). Eliminate sources of stress or unneeded complexity. Make time for yourself, both for your activities and your relaxation. Consider professional help if you feel like you need extra mental guidance, and always practice safe techniques.

**Q:** Where do I start if I want to manage my time better?

Learn to say no to things that aren't worth your attention. Make to-do lists and break down what needs to happen in to extremely small chunks. Analyze what ""needs"" to be done versus what doesn't. See how mental minimalism can help you accomplish more things by sharpening your mind.

**Q:** Where do I start if I want digital minimalism?

Smaller ideas: Delete the programs that you aren't using, and explore other alternatives. Aim for [simpler programs](http://onethingwell.org/). Clean your bookmarks and RSS feeds. Use less browser tabs. Visit less websites. If your music or movie library is too large for you, start making multiple elimination rounds. Consider your music, movie, and book collections and decide if you want to digitize them. 

Bigger ideas: Switching to a different operating system is a big step for some, but it can help to get some perspective on what you think you need. Try a free Linux LiveCD if you don't want to pay money for this experiment; a good pair would be [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) or [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/). If you want to make the jump from Windows/Mac/Linux to any of the others, or perhaps buy a new computer, make sure you're fully educated on the changes, be fully realistic of the benefits and don't do it lightly.

**Q:** What should I do about living with my parents who aren't minimalist?

Rephrasing your goals can help communicate what you want, so start reading back archives of r/minimalism or browsing other resources to help clarify. If that doesn't work, you should probably just mentally minimize if you can't convince them of your choices. You're young and you have plenty of time to explore your options later, so don't stress out about it.

**Q:** What should I do about living with my significant other/roommate/friend who isn't minimalist?

We don't know what it's like to be you in your situation, and no amount of text on the Internet can ever fix that. Relationships with people are weird and complicated. But, a good rule of thumb is to avoid trying to change people, because it rarely works.

1339496877.0	uxql6	Tip: Buy stuff and have less stuff!		69	15	28	"Hi
Just wanted to share a good tip on buying things as a minimalist.
It really works for me and it's a great way to further reduce clutter.

Steps:

1. Identify.
Find the thing you really need. Let's take an example: A new phone. Why do you need one? (List at least 5 sensible advantages (not just 'bigger screen')). Which one is the best? (not only for the price. Remember - a greedy man pays twice the price. ALWAYS purchase quality items). Whoa! That's really expensive! Do I really need it? (list 5 ways it will improve your life. Decide and choose.

2. Wait.
You probably already do this on a daily basis. Put the object on 'hold'. Wait two weeks before buying the product. That way you'll avoid the 'want' factor and really consider the items necessity. 

3. Sell. 
This is the crucial bit. Find two other objects in your house and sell them for at least half the price of the new product that you want to purchase. That way, every time you purchase something, you will reduce your inventory by 1 object. This really makes you think if you want to make the purchase and is it really worth it. 

If you use this simple scheme to make your purchases you'll end up having only top quality, crucial things you need. And you'll save money. And you'll drop the habit of purchasing things 'on-the-go'. 

Hope this helps, it helped me. "	t5_2r0z9	True

1360314129.0	184gd5	Need tips for drastic downsize in prep for overseas move	ljushjart	62	10	64	"I'm moving overseas this summer (to Sweden from US).  I'm thinking I'd like to take this opportunity to downsize drastically.  I would love some general tips and strategies for this.   I also have some specific ideas/questions.

- A main general struggle I have always had is worrying that I will get rid of something I need.  I'm not a wealthy person.  So having to re-purchase something that I get rid of is a big anxiety.  However I need to remember I can re-buy for probably close to same cost as ocean freight shipping of anything.

- Mementos and Pictures.  I'm going to try to whittle this down to just one box.  I'm thinking of possibly taking photos of items as way to remember them. Scanning paper items and photos.  It will be tough though and time consuming to do this.   Is this a difficult area for most people? 

- Clothes.  I've been losing weight after putting on quite a bit in recent years.  I have clothes of several different sizes.   I'd love to get rid of all the big ones and keep the super small ones that don't fit yet.   But wonder if I should only keep ones that fit right now.   However clothes are expensive in Sweden compare to here, so thinking I should be optimistic and in fact keep some of the skinny clothes. 

- Books.  This one is hard as I don't think I will have as easy access to books written in English.  And books in general are also more expensive in Sweden.   However books are heavy of course and expensive to ship.

**TL;DR**  Moving overseas in a few months.   I'm new to minimalism, but think this will be good opportunity to give it a try.  I'm seeking some advice on how to approach it mentally as well as ideas on what are the bare essentials

**EDIT**  Goodness thanks so much for all the great tips, inspiration and encouragement.   It is definitely going to help me.   I have approx 50 cubic feet of schtuff currently.   My first goal is to halve this amount.  (And then maybe halve that and so on)  I will report back!

1358306008.0	16nubs	Just wanted to say thanks /r/minimalism	moloko_chelloveck	60	8	13	"A year ago, I was unhappy. As I started making more money, my expenses were growing. Luxuries became regular expenses. I owned a lot of stuff, I spent a lot of money, and I consumed so much more than necessary for no reason beyond convenience. When I looked at what I would need to sustain my lifestyle for the rest of my life (big car, big house with lots of stuff to put in it, luxury clothing, convenience meals, pollution, being tethered to a job that didn't make me happy) the future looked worrisome. 

I realize this isn't /r/personalfinance but for me these changes weren't about money. They were about having ""enough"" instead of getting my hands on everything I could afford. I think the concept of ""enough"" is very skewed in North America, and I think that's what I've really learned in the last year.

I've been lurking here for the past year or so, and in conjunction with several other resources I've made some huge changes. I think my life will be drastically different as a result. 

**Regarding Posessions:**
I started selling stuff. Books, CDs, records, DVDs, clothes. Then giving away the stuff I couldn't sell. A library's worth of movies I didn't watch, shelves of books I had already read, and CDs/records that I didn't listen to (and hadn't in years). I didn't need it and I didn't want it. Donations to the local thrift store became a regular occurrence. Plus I made hundreds of dollars from stuff I didn't want and it all found a new home.

**Regarding Design and Aesthetics:**
I'm a structural engineer, or at least I will be in a few months once I finish my degree. Along the way, I developed a serious interest in minimalist architecture, especially the work of Tadao Ando and John Pawson. After reading Sarah Susanka's [Not So Big House](http://www.amazon.com/Not-So-Big-House-Susanka/dp/B003F76K0E) I decided that my grand plan will likely include the design and construction of my own home (by which I mean I will be architect, designer, engineer, construction supervisor and primary laborer). This home will not be a McMansion, it will be more like a 1000 square foot single bedroom home with an open concept living space. It also may not happen for another 10-20 years, but it's something to work towards.
I guess I can also mention here that I did a purge of my computer, then installed rainmeter to develop a cleaner interface. 

**Regarding Money and Consumption**
For me, saving money was a side effect of my desire to minimalize my lifestyle, but it quickly became a motivator. I read about the financial independence movement, and liked what I saw. I started with [Your Money or Your Life](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=your+money+or+your+life) and went from there. My mentor has been [Mr. Money Mustache] (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/). I read his entire blog (the equivalent of about a 700 page book) in a week. I highly recommend it. Jacob Lund Fisker at [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) has been another motivator. These guys not only taught me that minimalism could reduce my consumption, it could also free me from the financial constraints of paid work. They also gave me a clear guide of how to reach my goals. By no means do I plan to ""retire"" in the conventional sense, but it looks to me that I should be able to save enough to remove the *obligation* of paid work from my life before age 35.


My main goal here was just to thank you for the inspiration and to share some resources with you guys that you may or may not have come across before. You helped me redefine my worldview, and I can't wait for what the future holds."	t5_2r0z9	True

So here I am, looking to you for help. I would like to clean it all. Not necessarily strip the walls of the pictures, (and whatever else I've stuck up there), but I'd like to **purge as much as I can**. I just need help. I have no idea where to begin. Do I just throw everything out? Sell it? I'm in way over my head here, and just need some guidance on how to organize, clean, and maintain that cleanliness. 

And I know it's horrible to live in such a messy room, my parents already tell me enough about how gross it is. So please, be gentle. haha 

Thank you.

But, this trip, i've noticed that most of these things- tv's, blenders, computers, speakers, washing machines- all these machines, crowd out the mental space to think. It becomes harder to think critically; the noise reminds me that the things we own constantly call for our attention.

I'm going of for my freshman year of college in September and thought this would be a great thing to have me save some space here and at my dorm. So I started going through my closet, drawers, desk, storage bins and I really started to be enlightened. I got rid of useless stuff left and right and really started to make progress.

I had piles of books, clothes, art supplies, video games, etc. that was ready to be donated, sold or trashed when my Dad comes in. He asks me what I was doing with all this stuff. I told him about my plan of reducing the amount of stuff I own and just keeping what I need. My Dad is a man of holding onto things for dear life. Nothing towards the level of hoarding, but he keeps all of his papers or anything he thinks there is a possibility of needing in the future. So this was probably a big shock to him.

He started going through everything I was getting rid of and asking me why I don't want to keep it in case I needed it (ex. old board games, papers from HS, empty video game cases, and clothing passed down from my brothers). He was angry that I would just do this without thinking about it and told me to put the stuff back. I put my donate and selling things back but got rid of the things I was throwing out yesterday while he was out.

He reacted in a similar way when I told him I was an atheist. Just not able to understand the change in my lifestyle and rejecting it. So this is nothing new, but I'm just really discouraged that all of my hardwork and enthusiasm for a positive lifestyle change was just shut down like that because it's not something he thinks is ""normal"".

I just wanted to air this out and see if anyone else had this problem with people in their family where they simply don't understand why you would do this.

And I still want to thank you all for giving me a new perspective on things and this will definitely not be the end of my journey. I hope this ideology will carry over to my spending where I will begin to really consider what I am buying and how I will be using it in a week/month/year from then and whether or not it's worth it. (Case in point was two months ago where I saw this awesome Lego Naboo Starfighter at Toys R' Us and I though ""I should totally buy this because I didn't get to when I was a kid and I always wanted to"". Then I thought that 4 days from now it would be on my shelf with no use out of it besides the initial buliding of it. So I opted out and put the cash in the bank.)

tl;dr I wanted to begin my minimalistic purge of my less worldly possessions and was stopped by my materialistic Dad. It sucks."	t5_2r0z9	True
1337715356.0	tzq0u	Hello! Just stumbled on this subreddit. It's motivating, &amp; I have a couple of tips for people cutting down on clutter!	codyanne	62	9	21	"When my husband and I moved from one side of the hemisphere to the other last year, I didn't realize how much *stuff* we had. Stuff we didn't need at all - we donated a car load &amp; tossed out probably half a dozen more bags of not-donateable stuff. That alone has helped tremendously, but I still struggle with clutter (I call it ""horizontitis"" - inflammation of any horizontal surface with clutter) &amp; am working on cutting back.

A friend once suggested that if there are unimportant things I'm keeping for sentimental reasons, to take a photo of it and then get rid of it. T-shirts, home decor items, etc. - a folder on my PC's desktop takes up a lot less space!

Another thing, and this one is the most helpful to me, is that at our new place we have an outdoor shed. I've been storing some things out there, and I realized that after 6 months (or a year, if you have seasonal items) if I haven't gone in there for them... I don't really need them. It was *such* a relief to get rid of that stuff.

Hope these help some of you, and I'm looking forward to learning from this subreddit as well!"	t5_2r0z9	True

A short story on me: 

About 2.5 years back I stumbled onto a blog outlining the 100 item challenge which began my thinking: Could I live happily with only 100 items? 6 months after this I moved off to college and like most freshmen brought far to much with me. I shared a small 10X14 room filled with the ""essentials"". After a few weeks I began to rid myself of things I knew I would not use and from there it progressed with each step towards minimalism I learned more about myself and what I truly want [although my journey will never end, its a good start]. This sub has been a wonderful resource for me and as of today, I have maybe 6 medium boxes of possessions [mostly school related] and a few other odds and ends, not that this is a challenge. 

So again I say thank you,
