1372257554.0	1h3yon	Tips for Female Backcountry Backpackers	KestrelLowing	435	61	247	"Slightly inspired by a previous post on /r/Backpacking, I figured I'd share a few tips I've learned for female backpackers and hope that everyone would chip in with their tips!

* Buy a pee funnel.  Seriously one of the best purchases I've made for outdoor use.  I have the [pStyle](http://www.thepstyle.com/) and I'm quite fond of it because it's really easy to clean.
* Menstrual Cups.  I use the Divacup, but there are many different styles.  If you ever are backpacking during that time of month, this is a god-send.  Just bury the waste like poop and you're golden.
* Panty liners.  I always wear a panty liner while backpacking so I don't have to use toilet paper when I pee.  I know this sounds really gross, but remember I use the pStyle.  With that particular pee funnel, you can kind of scrape it across the region and that gets rid of the majority of excess and then the panty liner deals with the rest.  Note that if you're prone to UTIs or yeast infections, this might not be the best idea for you.
* Down there is sensitive.  If you can't deal with synthetic underwear, don't use it.  I have to bring cotton underwear or I would be very unhappy!  I bring 4 pairs, and then wash them when I'm done.  It takes a while to dry, which is why I bring 4 pairs.
* For extra cleanup, an empty Mio or similar bottle does wonders.  This works great for the pStyle, menstrual cups, or your body.  Basically, use up one of those liquid drink mixes but keep the bottle.  Fill it with water and spray off your pee funnel, your menstrual cup, and yourself.  This is particularly good for helping prevent UTIs and yeast infections as a clean vagina is a healthy vagina - although I'd suggest stripping before cleaning yourself!  Also, don't use alcohol wipes - it will just upset your balance.
* If you have long hair, I highly suggest some sort of headband to keep it away from your face (and to make it look not quite so greasy).  Also, french braids are awesome.
* For showering, I use a bladder of water, hang it in a tree, and then go to town.  I really like having a pack towel as well as a bandanna for showering.
* For buying gear, know if you sleep cold or not.  Women generally sleep colder than men.  I know I sleep cold because I nearly always am snuggling up next to my SO at night because he's so warm!  But if I want to be comfortable at 30F, I will have to buy a 15F or so bag.  Also, a really, really important component is the sleeping pad.  I have an all-season pad with an R value of 4.9 which is awesome.
* Take advantage of female gear if it's applicable.  Women's specific gear isn't just a girly color (usually!).  It's often tailored to work better with female bodies.  For example, if you have any sort of ample hips or breasts, you'll likely need to look at women's backpacks.  The straps are curved to go around boobs and the hip belts are more appropriate for curvy hips.  Woman's sleeping bags are often shorter (only works if you're short!) and will have a bit more space in the hip area, and a bit less in the shoulders.  Sometimes they will also be a bit overstuffed, particularly in the foot region.  Woman's trekking poles are often a bit shorter and therefore lighter (if you're a short guy, might want to look at these!) and sometimes have smaller grips
* Clothing is one of the most aggravating things for female backpackers - particularly if you do not have an 'athletic' build.  I have quite ample hips and butt and ended up buying rock climbing pants opposed to regular hiking pants as they have stretch to them and made it possible for me to fit into them.  Additionally, make sure to get a shirt that's long enough to wear with a hip belt.  Sometimes it can be very difficult to find.

1368343398.0	1e69pa	Hearing footsteps outside the tent at night. . .	velocide	321	36	115	"So, a couple of nights ago, my son and I were out in Big Sur, and I had set up my tent in a dry, grassy meadow, at a higher elevation, with a nice view of the ocean.  I had had a hard time trying to find a flat spot, because the terrain was pretty hilly. We weren't remote, but the trail looked like it hadn't been used recently.

I stayed up about an hour after my son went to sleep in his tent, and I played with my camera, because we had a pretty clear night sky.  Then I turned-in.  As I lay there, falling asleep, the air was pretty still, and the only sounds were the insects and the occasional owl.  But then I heard a crunchy noise, like footsteps in the dirt.  ""crunch, crunch"". I couldn't really tell, from inside my tent, which direction it was coming from. It sounded pretty close. Maybe within a few dozen yards. I thought it was strange, because I wasn't hearing grass or bushes being disturbed.  ""crunch crunch.   crunch crunch"".  It was very tentative. And in pairs.  Like a bipedal animal.  I tried to imagine what it could possibly be.  A deer?  Definitely not a bear.  I had our food in a bear cannister, but because I didn't think there were really bears around, I left it right next to the tent.  I would not have been at all surprised to get swarmed by racoons or a skunk. But this didn't sound like those.  I was afraid to move, because I didn't want to make a sound in my tent.  It sounded close.  ""crunch crunch"".   

I thought that it could be a person - maybe.  But I really couldn't imagine anyone else hiking up that trail in the dark. We had had a hard enough time in the daylight.   We hadn't seen anybody else on the trail all day, except a couple of day-hikers at the trailhead, leaving, that morning.  ""crunch crunch.  crunch crunch"".  

I quickly grabbed my headlamp, unzipped the door, and opened the flap to look out, and scanned the surroundings. I did a pretty quick sweep. Nothing. I turned off the light. I had made a lot of noise, but I didn't wake my son.  I waited a few minutes, but I didn't hear anything. I tried the light again.  Nothing.  I called out to my son, and woke him up.  He didn't hear anything either.  I just ended up making him nervous.  

I zipped up the tent, turned off the light, and laid there, listening. Minutes ticked by, and I heard nothing more.   Hours - and nothing.  Had I imagined it?  What could it have been?


Eventually, I calmed down, and fell asleep. When I woke, it was already light, though the sun hadn't yet crested the ridge to our east.  ""crunch crunch""  - There's that sound again! only now I can hear exactly where it's coming from, because I'm laying on my side, not my back.  It's coming from right under my head.  

That's when I remembered that when I set up my tent, it was between a set of about 4 gopher holes.  That sound had to be a busy little rodent, taking care of his mining, maybe inches under my head.

TL;DR - Wasn't a bigfoot. Was a gopher under my tent."	t5_2qqom	True

1363782660.0	1anqf6	So I guess we're one upping each other's pictures again.	freedomweasel	297	48	39	"Could you all take the time to at least tell us *where* these pictures were taken?  Saying that the photo is from ""Alaska"" doesn't really help much as that narrows it down to almost 600k sq miles.  

This is /r/campingandhiking so it would probably be good to tell us something about your trip that presumably involved camping or hiking.  What mountain are you on?  How long did it take to get there?  How was the weather that day? Would you go back again?

Just something other than the usual reddit ""I'll see your karma farm and raise you my better karma farm"" would go a long way to keeping the quality of the content in this subreddit high.  Pictures are great, don't stop posting them, but at least tell us all why we should be interested in your picture.  If Steve House just posted a summit shot of his last trip, it would be cool and all, but it's *far* more interesting when he tells us that it's a first ascent of the north ridge of Mt Awesome, and it took 3 days in whiteout conditions and they celebrated with root beers and skittles on top."	t5_2qqom	True

I came up with camping syndrome from Paris Syndrome : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome

Last month, a few buddies and I went car camping. Buddy invited these two virgin-campers along. I don't know if my buddy talked to them about what to bring but when they arrived they brought a bedsets to sleep in at night. Had no tent so they used someone else's.

* They complained that it was too cold (40-50F) at night. They wore hooded sweaters at night.

* They complained that camping is dirty. 

* On the first morning, they drove 10-20 miles away from the campgrounds to get signal for their phones — multiple times. 

* Their camping spot has a fire-pit with a grill but they were hungry so they drove 20 miles out of the camping spot to grab fast food, drove all the way back into camp, and ate their food there. They didn't even buy other people any food!

I know some other people who have mentioned ""I would love to go camping - I love nature!"" who act similar to these two individuals. I could be wrong but I feel like these people just have 'Camping Syndrome'.

1359313369.0	17doz3	Hey folks, I build trails in Arizona for a living, sort of AMA type thread if any of you have questions	berbatumpiper	205	23	138	"A little background: I started building trails here in Arizona back in 2011. I've been on six conservation crews at this point. Three of those crews primarily did trails and fencing around the state, the other three were a mix of trail construction &amp; maintenance, fencing, and chainsaw work. I've worked for nearly every forest service district in the state, a few national parks, and a couple state parks.

Here's a post of trail photos from 2011 mainly:
http://imgur.com/a/LCZG0

A little about our crews and how we work:
We have eight people on a crew (two leaders and six americorps corpsmembers). We typically work eight days on and six days off, and camp during our work week. We work class I to class V trails and do everything from brushing, re-tread, staircase construction, drainage, retaining walls, re-routes, and log outs with chainsaws or crosscuts (depending on wilderness status).

So yeah, not sure if there's any interest in what I do, but I'm around today and figured I'd throw it out there.

EDIT: Wow, really cool the amount responses! I'll try to answer some questions tonight, but I'm also getting ready for a week of hiking cement out of a canyon. I wont be camping after work this week, so if more questions come in I'll get to them asap

oh yeah, and here's more photos (only from my first crew back in early 2011): http://www.flickr.com/photos/60058056@N04/"	t5_2qqom	True

1375538494.0	1jmjuc	The Problem With Trail Mix.	CaptainNoBoat	192	36	31	"There is one very glaring, obvious problem with common trail mix.  You all know what it is - and don't even act like you don't.  

*It has M&amp;Ms.*  
Delicious, chocolatey M&amp;Ms.  

You buy them, and think to yourself ""What a nice mix of salt, fruit, nuts, and some sweets"" without realizing the mental agony which is about to consume you.  

You have a long day of hiking, climb a mountain, and get out your bag to snack on.  You look into the bag and see that many M&amp;M's reside in a certain part of the bag.  You grab and get 2 raisins, 5 peanuts, an almond, and 2 M&amp;M's - *The perfect bite*  

It's wonderful, but you think to yourself that you need to eat the contents evenly, or you will run out of M&amp;M's.  So you grab randomly: 7 raisins this time.  Somewhat disappointing, but it's okay.  You grab again:  6 peanuts, 1 raisin, 1 almond:  ""Ugh, all I want is one measly M&amp;M.""  You look back into the bag and notice a glorious conglomerate of colored candies in a certain spot.  2 peanuts, 3 raisins, *Five M&amp;M's*.  You look around to make sure no one is judging you.  It feels almost dirty.  

Instantly, you regret your gluttony.  You tell yourself the next few bites will be M&amp;M free, and you hold yourself to it.  You put the bag away.  

Later on, you're getting bored of tuna and crackers, and reach for the damnable bag.  ""I'm never going to look into the bag,"" you say.  ""Then I will have an even amount of M&amp;M's left at the end of the bag.""  Listen to yourself.  It's pathetic.  You start grabbing for the trail mix, but you notice that you can *feel* the shape of the M&amp;M's.  You can discern every bite with the touch of your fingers.  

*Face it, you NEED the M&amp;M's*  
*Who cares if the last of the bag doesn't have any?*  
All of these thoughts start to invade your mind.  

You're hiking, trying to enjoy the beauty of nature, but the chocolate thoughts relentlessly occupy your brain.  ""Oh, what a lovely chocolate-capped mountain.. I.. mean.. ice-capped mountain,"" You say.  Your hiking friends look at you strangely.  *Screw them,* You think.  *They're not your real friends.*  *They just want your M&amp;M's.*  *I fucking know Brian has been eating some, and he doesn't even ration them.*  

You can't take it any more.  You tell your friends to go ahead of you as you pull out the bag.  You tear at the contents, meticulously grabbing anything colored and throwing peanuts and raisins all about you.  You eat a pound of M&amp;M's, chocolate dripping out of your mouth, as you sit with a full belly against a rock.  You can hardly move, but Damn, was it worth it.  

As you consider the possibility of never buying trail mix again and changing your life, you hear a low, grumbling noise nearby.  A 750 lb Grizzly is very much interested in the piles of peanuts around you.  It's too late.  The M&amp;M's have gotten the best of you.

It's too late."	t5_2qqom	True

I was thinking the south district, because it's more secluded and less busy on such a busy holiday weekend. 

Also, it should be noted that I'm fat and out of trail shape, but trying to get back into it, so I'm not that fast of a hiker. If you're interested in backpacking that holiday, and don't have anyone to go with like me, it would be cool, right?

If you get an itchy bug bite, you can buy a product to put on it so it stops itching and you don't end up scraping all your own skin off.
 
Basically, it's just alcohol.  It stings a bit, but stops the itch.   It seems like many people don't know that hand sanitizer is pretty much the same thing,  so if you are in the wild, and you get an itchy bite that you have gone down the dangerous path of starting to scratch  (once you start, good luck stopping while you still have flesh in that area)  you can just put some hand sanitizer on it.  It will sting for a bit, but it will stop itching."	t5_2qqom	True

1295819918.0	f7p1s	Why I hate normal gear reviews and what I did about it	Geekpacker	104	4	58	"A year ago I bought a Steripen water purifier.  It broke the third time I used it.  I exchanged it, and the new one never worked.  I exchanged it again and the third one worked for 6 months before dying in a xbox360 homage of red blinking lights.

This was a decently reviewed product.  Even today, at REI, it still has a 71% customer approval rating: [http://www.rei.com/product/799003](http://www.rei.com/product/799003)

**My problem with gear review sites is that they either are spammy or they tend to have mostly good reviews for everything.**  I’ve also seen way too many reviews of backpacking gear that started with “I just got X last week and it’s great!”  That’s nice, but I want to know how you feel about a piece of gear after 300 miles.

I’m sure most of us are familiar with [trailjournals.com](http://trailjournals.com/).  I love following along with random people’s hikes and dream about my future hikes.  It turns out that people hiking 2179 miles have some strong opinions on their gear.  I trust these accumulated anecdotes a lot more than random reviews from a site that has an interest in selling gear.

300,000+ journal entries later and I’ve got a backpacking gear review website made up completely of mentions of gear by people hiking long distance trails.  I search through the journals for mentions of a product and then categorize the mention as positive or negative.  If the mention is particularly descriptive, I flag it for display.  Here’s the result:

[Best Backpacking Reviews](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/)

OK, so I’m not one to come up with an interesting name.  And you’ll quickly recognize I’m not a designer either.  But I think the data is actually interesting.  Coming full circle, have a look at these [SteriPen reviews](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Water-Purifiers/SteriPen-Adventurer).  Only 29% of the mentions are positive.  Several people who expounded on their SteriPen hate mentioned the red blinking light of death that I experienced.

On the flip side, take a look at these [Smartwool Sock reviews](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Socks/Smartwool).  Here’s a particularly good one:

“...In Bear Mountain, I got my mail drop with 2 pair of BRAND NEW SOCKS!! What a treat. Hard to believe I got over 1300 miles out of the first two pair! Smartwool socks get 2 thumbs up. I also had a cheeseburger, fries &amp; salad at the restaurant...”

**1300 miles out of two pairs of socks.**  That’s the sort of thing I want to know when picking out backpacking socks.

Right now I only have a few categories: [Backpacks](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Backpacks), [Sleeping Bags](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Sleeping-Bags), [Stoves](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Stoves), [Water Purifiers](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Water-Purifiers), [Headlamps](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Headlamps), [Socks](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Socks), and [Tents](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Tents).  I’m adding more products and categories as I have time.

I’m looking for feedback.  Any feedback is great, but in particular:

1. Does the concept make sense?
2. Is the lack of graphic design sense so bad that it detracts from the usefulness?
3. What products are missing that you are curious about?
4. What other uses of the dataset can you think of?

I’m planning on eventually doing some sort of affiliate marketing on the outgoing links, but I have gotten around to figuring that out yet.  Any suggestions on this front would be appreciated.

You need to carry a map and compass with you every trip. There was a thread about GPS recently and every comment about maps and compasses were heavily downvoted.

This information is extremely important: a map and compass is the most reliable method of navigation. Learn it and use it because it could save your life and the lives of your fellow hikers. GPSes are nice toys, but there are a lot of things that can go wrong with them, leaving you stranded in the middle of nowhere."	t5_2qqom	True

After finding a good spot to lay our stuff down we went out to collect some water, but now it was really dark. We started following the sounds of a nearby stream and in the middle of the forest where we haven't seen or heard anyone for miles we come across a lone headlamp in the woods.
As we approach the light saying hello and declaring our friendliness, we see that the lone headlamp wearer is also armed with a large shotgun and its really dark and we're very alone. Playing it cool we tell him we're looking for water and he explains the best way to water as if we're navigating downtown streets in his home town. 
Turns out he works for the forest service and he's keeping the feral pig population down, I guess the best hunting is at night. Who knew? Sounds like a wild job to be doing alone. He may have lied to us, but at least he didn't kill us. 
And lucky for me I packed some extra TP to clean up after myself.

**TL;DR: Came across a guy with a shotgun in the middle of the night, Miles into the woods, turns out he works for the park and helped us find water.**
