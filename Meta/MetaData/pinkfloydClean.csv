So for the next few days or even week, my dad is in the hospital getting an EEG done. For those of you that don't know what it is, an EEG is a test that measures brain activity in people with seizures. My dad has been having seizures for a year, forcing him to give up his license, and not allowing him to work. He might try to hide it, but every time I look into his eyes I can see the anger and fear he feels. Earlier I was listening to Shine On You Crazy Diamond, and I started crying my eyes out. This made me call him and tell him how I felt. The call started with me crying, but ended with him telling stories and me laughing. Not only have I not felt this happy in a while, but I haven't felt this close to my dad in a long time. If not for Pink Floyd, I wouldn't have made that call. So thanks Pink Floyd for helping me stay strong :)	t5_2qhwe	True

About 6 months ago I found my dad's original cd copy of The Wall and decided to listen to it. I was amazed at some of the songs I had been missing out on and fell in love with the album. Fast forward 4 or 5 months, I finally broke down and bought dark side of the moon. I immediately listened to the whole thing and was absolutely blown away by its beauty. At this point I literally out loud said ""holy shit, this is incredible"" I then went home and started youtubing full albums and one after one I was literally dumbfounded at their pure musical sound. Since I bought dark side I've gone from a fan to full on obsessed. In the past two months I have probably listened to every album over 20 times. I don't think I have ever listened to such beautiful music in my entire life and it makes it hard to listen to other music. Pink Floyd has literally changed my entire view on music and for that I thank you. Jesup I love Pink Floyd so freaking much!!!"	t5_2qhwe	True

1342243806.0	wjemo	Big fan for 20+ years and The Wall is one of my least favorite of Floyd's records.	cy_sperling	84	13	47	"I know it is not a popular opinion, especially considering the front page is almost exclusively Wall related. The Wall was the first Floyd record I heard and I loved it. I STILL love it, but nonetheless, it is among my least favorites. To me, it represents everything that went wrong with the band as Roger took sole control. It is, with the exception of a few songs, very much the Roger Waters show. The symbolism is overt and heavy handed, lacking any subtlety. Nick's drumming is pretty poor. And let's call a spade a spade. Another Brick part 2 is a frickin' disco song. It feels like they were pandering a bit. It was '78 after all.

Dark Side of the Moon is obviously the band firing on all cylinders. No one creative voice overpowers and all of their playing is at their respective collaborative peak. It was the beginning of the end unfortunately. Wish You Were Here is fantastic but sort of lopsided in a weird way (THAT is the record that should've been a double LP!!)

Maybe it is that I just love 67-74 permutations SO much...

And one final thought worthy of discussion. Obscured By Clouds is criminally underrated. FANTASTIC record. It deserves a lot more love than it gets."	t5_2qhwe	True

I then heard Time on the radio playing, and as I listened to the lyrics, each line made me feel worse and worse about myself. Then the solo came out, and I tell you now, that solo can really channel the atmosphere and message the song is trying to portray. As the line ""One day closer to death"" was sung, I started crying because I realized that I was indeed wasting away the hours in an offhand way.

To clarify: The Dark Side of the Moon is about all the makes people mad, like:

* Greed (Money)

* The passage of time (Time)

* Stress and travel (On the run)

* Fear of Death (The great gig in the sky)

* Conflict (Us and Them)

And Breathe is there to introduce us to this lunacies and Brain Damage/Eclipse is there to wrap it all up.

But I never got what lunacy ""Any Colour you Like"" represented. There are no lyrics or spoken parts like ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" detailing what it is about.

One of the songs featured on ""Animals"" had been a leftover from the ""Wish You Were Here"" sessions. Originally, 'Dogs' was titled 'Raving and Drooling.' (sic) (actually it is 'You've Gotta Be Crazy')


**Dave:** On ""Wish You Were Here"" we spent a lot of time in the rehearsal situation just working things out, you know, writing as we went along. 'Raving and Drooling,' or 'Dogs' as it was later known was just a simple little chord sequence that I had written and that everyone seemed to like. I liked it because all the chords were very unusual chords and you could play almost any note over the top of them. Like for guitar solos they were great because you could play nearly any note. So you can zoom around anywhere and not worry about what frets you hit or anything because almost anything you do hit if you do it deliberately enough will sound alright."	t5_2qhwe	True

While studying last year, I found Animals on my iTunes (which was synched with my dad's), and it blew my mind. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much if I hadn't stumbled across it. 

Yesterday at work, I was browsing YouTube for music, and decided to listen to that other Floyd album, Atom Heart Mother. I love Echoes, Shine on You Crazy Diamond, and all of Animals (anything over 20 mins. is awesome), so the opening suite of Atom Heart Mother actually killed me. 

As the song opened, I heard the horns sounding - Am I still listening to Pink Floyd? They busted into that nasty jam with French horns over everything, and I was shocked, as this is unlike any Floyd (or music) I've heard before. Then the beautiful, flowing bass/violin/keyboard solo, into a wailing guitar solo, followed by the choral section. 

But what slaughtered me was the part starting around 10 minutes. Starting with a typical pink Floyd groove, eventually, the chanting voices come in. Up to this point, I was grooving pretty hard, but those voices added an entirely new dimension to it. I envisioned myself groovin and chanting around a huge bonfire with some native americans, decked out in tribal garb. I can't really describe how awesome it was.

Then they close the song out with more awesome orchestral parts, a spooky part (another thing they do incredibly), and a huge ending, with trains, loudspeakers, and sheep all sounding along the way.

I can't wait to listen to it with my dad."	t5_2qhwe	True

Of course, they only played snippets of each song, but I was captivated, and I asked my mother to order it for me then and there. I remember unwrapping it on Xmas Morning, 2001, and I remember the look on my mom's face when I was more excited about the CD than the (then brand new) Xbox that she had stood in line for 4 hours and spent over $300 to get.

Pink Floyd has been my favorite band ever since. I've bought every album they released, and named my pug/terrier mix ""Floyd"".

Upon arriving in some secluded bay or something in Australia they spy an enormous mega yacht at anchor.  

Being the only other boat in the area, and with restless children on board, the kids are hoping that there are other kids to play with on this super-yacht.  Sure enough, through the binoculars they see some kids playing on the deck of this yacht, and through some type of signalling, the kids get each other's attention and a little dinghy goes into the water to collect the kids from the family boat.

Hours of playing and ski-doo riding ensue, and around dinner time, the dinghy comes back to collect the kids parents.  They hop on board and are treated to the hospitality one might expect aboard one of the most luxurious ships either of them had ever seen.  After dinner and great conversation with the owners of this yacht, the mother gets up the nerve to ask what the owner (an older guy, but very down to earth) does for a living.  

As humbly as you could imagine, he says, ""Oh, I've played in a few bands in my career.""  ""Oh, how great, any that I might have heard of?""

""Maybe...Have you heard of Pink Floyd?""

Yea, it was David Gilmour."	t5_2qhwe	True

1363527759.0	1agog6	Thoughts on The Final Cut.		46	4	26	"For the longest time, I've always glossed over listening to The Final Cut. Upon first listening, it just seemed like a vessel for Roger Waters' lyrics, as there were barely any memorable moments of music for me. However, after giving it a few more chances, I realise what Roger was trying to accomplish. The lyrics, in their delivery and their message, stand amazingly well on their own, and he merely wanted a backdrop. This has altered my opinion that The Final Cut was just a Water'd down version of The Wall (which I suppose wasn't too far wrong, as it was originally meant to be titled Spare Bricks).

My favourite moment from the album has to be in the title track, 'The Final Cut', where Waters sonorously asks, ""Would you send me packing, or would you take me home?"" followed by a simple yet blistering solo by Gilmour, that just gives me goosebumps every time; it honestly has to be one of my favourite Floyd moments. It's been some time since I've been so incredibly moved by a [snippet of music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4x_l4XYqK8s#t=182s).

Or would Syd have slightly swayed the brilliance with his dated early 60's English psychedelic sound? It may seem ungrateful to think this way about the man who made Floyd famous, But when I listen to the early Barrett heavy songs of the Floyd catalog, I can't help but feel that he would have swayed the sound that we came to love.
