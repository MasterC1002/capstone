1363178333.0	1a7mu7	[Mod Announcement] We'd like your input! The /r/knitting Subscriber Survey	CupcakeOctopus	333	22	53	"Hello everyone!

We've been considering a user survey for some time now, and finally put our heads together to draft one.  

The survey is meant to give us a better idea of how much our subscribers are reading /r/knitting, how they view the content here, what types of content they like and dislike, how they participate, and what their thoughts, opinions, and ideas are.  

I want to be clear, the data collected from this survey will **not** be used to make any major policy changes at the present time.  We just want to get an idea of how our subscribers feel about various things so we can try to make the experience better for more people.  If everyone really loves a particular kind of post, we want to try and encourage and nurture those posts, but it's hard to do when we don't know what y'all want.

The survey does ask you to provide your username.  Only one mod (me, CupcakeOctopus) will have access to the full data spreadsheet with usernames attached to it.  I will not share the data in full form with *anyone*.  The results of the survey will be presented on /r/knitting, but only in a form that's de-identified (usernames removed) and aggregate (everyone's responses mushed together).  To repeat, your responses with usernames attached will ***not*** be shared with anyone.

The multiple choice/checkbox section of the survey can be completed in roughly five minutes, and then there's a set of open-ended questions where you can really let us know what you like, what you dislike, and what ideas you have for /r/knitting.  Because the responses will be de-identified, if you have any idea for some type of project that you'd like to organize but you need some assistance, consider message one or all of the mods - your survey responses will be de-identified, so we won't know who wanted to organize what...

In order to make it worth your while, we're offering a chance to win a prize if you fill out the survey!  The ~~winner~~ two winners will be drawn using a random number generator, and will each receive a Ravelry pattern of their choice (up to $10 USD value).  

Without further ado, [the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13NdcNz0hX1b_dEQJlTlbXHvpT7DGK4iQ74BzqWjn_Rg/viewform).  Thank you so very much for your input!  You can PM me with questions, or leave them as comments below.

***Please upvote for visibility - it's a self-post, so I don't get any karma from it, but we really want everyone to have the opportunity to provide input!!!***

*Update* - First of all, you guys are awesome.  Thank you so much for adding your opinions!  Also, we've had another offer to donate a pattern, so there will be **two winners drawn**!"	t5_2qiu0	True

1359382308.0	17ffui	[FO] Hobbit cloak	plantwardo	312	26	58	"[pictures](http://imgur.com/a/Sxtlg)

This has taken me about a year--nine months of semi-steady knitting to make the monster, and then three months of it sitting around waiting for me to sort it out properly. It's made from around 3 kg of aran wool yarn, Woodland colour from New Lanark Mill, which you can find [here](http://www.newlanarkshop.co.uk/shop.php?view=product&amp;product=206) if you so wish--if you call them up, they can post you the cones.

Pattern was derived from a sewing one, found [here](http://www.alleycatscratch.com/lotr/Things/FCloak/FCloak_pattern.htm). I can't weave or sew very well, so my daft little brain thought I should knit it. If anyone else wants to do this, I should warn you, do a gauge swatch! And do it well. I wound up having to trim loads of it off--waste of yarn, but I'm making it into pockets so it's turned out fine. The entire thing is in moss stitch, which I like because it's not too stretchy--would deeply not recommend garter stitch, as the weight of the cloak will likely stretch it out. I knitted it on a circular needle, using it as a very long straight one.

If you look at the sewing pattern, I knitted it starting from the widest part of the semicircle. The very short version of the pattern is that because it's a semicircle, you can graph it with y = √(r² - x²), where r=radius=half the number of stitches you've cast on. To figure out where your decreases are, take the row you're on and figure out where that intersects with the semicircle equation. So, for instance, if you are on row 26, you can pop over to a graphing calculator or WolframAlpha or something and find the intersection of y=25 and y= √(r² - x²) to find the number of stitches in your current row, and compare it to the previous one to find out how many decreases you need to do.

I'm afraid I can't really remember how I managed to make the neckhole--similar process to above, figuring out how wide it needed to be and working from there--decreasing the halfway point, and then increasing back again. I thiink when I got to the midway point on the first row, I marked where the neck opening was meant to be and left some extra yarn so I could go back, cut it and weave in the ends.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense--if anyone wants to make one, I can probably write up a more coherent pattern for you.

After I finished that, I made the hood, which was just a standard knit-a-rectangle-fold-it-in-half pattern, as I couldn't be bothered to make the film-accurate hood. I made the mistake of not getting my gauge properly, so when I finished it was too big for me. I tried to rectify this by felting it slightly, which turned out to be a good thing as it is now a better texture and thicker. It took me about three runs through the hot-water-hot-dryer cycle to get it anywhere near felted, however--even now, it's not completely felted, as stitch definition is still clear. I still had to snip quite a lot of cloth off the bottom to get it to its current form and then hem it--apologies for the scalloped hem, I haven't gotten around to re-blocking it yet.

Anyway, that's the cloak! I haven't properly worn it out in public yet but I will soon, odd looks be damned. It's very warm, being wool, although I don't fancy risking it in the rain. If you have any questions, ask away!"	t5_2qiu0	True

1358536762.0	16tyzr	My friend wanted a Gimli helmet with beard, so I obliged her. (FO)	frakintrekker	313	39	33	"So my dear friend found this picture (http://imgur.com/eW1T8) and asked if I could crochet her one. I said I couldn't because I am not that good at crocheting (yet), but I could do my best to knit one. Luckily I had enough spare yarn that the only thing I needed to buy was yarn for the beard. I know you guys like patterns, but a lot of this was winging it, so I'll be as descriptive as I can and show some step by step pictures. 

So first I started with just a basic beanie pattern I got from ravelry on US 6 double pointed needles. I worked bottom up, first adding a longer back on the beanie for the helmet effect (http://imgur.com/JZkG9). 

Then I made a band to go around the forehead and after lots of ribbiting got the shape I wanted for the top pieces. Here I used 6mm needles with worsted yarn. I sewed the pieces together and stuffed them (http://imgur.com/LR3dY). 

After I cleaned all that up and got the stuffing just right I worked on the next layer and the base for the beard. Everything but the beard was done on US 10 needles, the beard was done on US 6. I did bind off and cast on for the mouth so I could reduce any amount of sewing I'd need to do, I had to play with the number of reduced stitches a few times to get a good snug, but not too snug, fit for the chin area. Sorry about the duck face, the beard was loose so I was trying to hold it in place with my lip, and thus the unfortunate duck face (http://imgur.com/p1U8p) 

Now that that was done I had the wonderful job of looping and knotting long beard strands, except for the lip I put a row of strands in every other row. When that was done I braided it into sections and tied them. Due to the weight of the beard I threaded some elastic string around the mouth so it would stay in place and keep my friends face warm (http://imgur.com/NwebS). 

The final stage was sewing in all the helmet details as accurately as possible. Hope this helps anyone looking to knit something similar (http://imgur.com/GNJKr)."	t5_2qiu0	True

But after reading the subreddit and FAQ and stuff on here, I bought a set of needles and yarn four days ago and today I sat down and [made a hat](http://i.imgur.com/qoDsToo.jpg?1) in four hours :) It doesn't really fit me properly but I don't care, I'm keeping it forever.

Bonus: I finally have something to talk about with my mum.

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words everyone. See, this is exactly what I'm talking about."	t5_2qiu0	True

My best friend just had an adorable baby boy on May 26th. They live in England, and I live in the States, and it's been so hard for me (as a friend) to be so far away while she's been pregnant. It's even harder now, knowing I won't get to see him until at least his first birthday. So I knew I wanted to make something really, really special for him, but I'd had knitter's block on what *exactly* I wanted to make starting sometime in February. The minute she texted me a picture of Baby Miles, I knew what I should make. This is the result! I'm SO pleased with how it turned out, and I know it will be that one blanket that he loves to death - which I am totally fine with. The more loved, the better! I hope r/knitting loves this blanket as much as I do!!

All of the patterns come from [Elaine Fitzpatrick](http://www.ravelry.com/designers/elaine-fitzpatrick) and are super easy and quick to knit up. She has cloth and bib patterns for everything I made here. One of my patients told me about her site. She's a genius!

I used [Martha Stewart Craft Yarn Extra Soft Wool Blend](http://marthastewart.lionbrand.com/marthaStewartCrafts/extrasoft.html),  and size 6 needles. I was able to make 2 squares from each skein (yardage was just short of being able to make 3 squares so I'll be gifting someone a nice scarf this Christmas with the leftovers). To join the squares I used a baseball stitch.

(A lot of ~~people~~ non-knitters have asked how long this took me. I've estimated that it took between 35 and 40 hours, including joining time.)"	t5_2qiu0	True

It would be hand-painted yarn (probably start with superwash sock yarns and expanding to other weights/fibers if it's successful) with each colorway named after a cocktail, and the label would have mixing instructions for that cocktail printed on it. 

For example, there'd be a color called Cosmo that would be bright cranberries, oranges, peachy pinks, and small splashes of lime, and it would have the recipe for a classic Cosmo (vodka, cranberry juice, cointreau, lime) printed on the label.

Edit: DANG! This thread kinda blew up overnight, didn't it? Thanks for being so enthusiastic and supportive! I'm going to do some number crunching on what it would take to get this started, and what I would have to charge per ball to make it work, so I will keep you updated!"	t5_2qiu0	True

It took probably 1.25 balls of each color, and well over 100 hours of knitting BUT I AM SO PROUD. I really just had to share.

I know I enjoy seeing things others are working on or fave, as it gives me inspiration! So, if you want to do this, and don't mind posting your ravatar, then join in the fun!

The yarn is from another crafty girl and is the strong sock yarn in the custom Reddit colorway. I used the [planned pooling website](http://www.plannedpooling.com/?stitches=46&amp;Color_1=FA8D20&amp;Stitches_1=30&amp;Color_2=1E8DBD&amp;Stitches_2=43&amp;Color_3=42F0FC&amp;Stitches_3=23&amp;type=flat&amp;number_colors_input=3&amp;comment=&amp;old_n_colors=3) to come up with the scarf width after knitting a small swatch and determining the stitch counts for each color.

Here is the end result [Reddit Yarn Scarf](http://imgur.com/a/vs2ys)
I cast on 46 stitches using US10 needles and knit the first and last 3 stitches of each row to form the border. It blocked out to 65 inches long by 8.5"" wide, 72 inches long including the fringe. 

You can see that the pooling did not work entirely as planned. The middle went well, but both ends pooled to one side. I'm guessing that was because it was a custom dyed yarn. It was a very cool experiment and I will definitely be using the planned pooling site for my other variegated yarns. "	t5_2qiu0	True

I picked it up again last week thinking I could manage my urges better. And then last Sunday happened. I had my morning coffee and leisurely picked up my Fair Isle project thinking I'd do this for about an hour and enjoy the rest of the weekend ... and then it was night. I'd blown through an entire season of Damages on the ipad Netflix. What's worse, I had been sitting on the floor, on my butt all day. And now, it is chafed and raw. My fiancé had to put  ointment and a bandaid on my butt. I wish I were making this up. 

At this rate, I might lose clients and my housekeeping. Laundry is piling up. I think I've lost control. My bum hurts. Don't let this happen to you.

Well, everything turned out in a pleasing manner. After blocking, the fair isle stopped puckering, the sweater gained in length and decreased in width. Where it was baggy before, it now hugs what needs to be hugged and skims what ought to be skimmed. 

You wouldn't think so from the picture, but we are [quite happy together](http://i.imgur.com/s4Iyif2.jpg).

**and it was amazing how many people said ""the company!""**


I take back every time I've ever grumped about too many FO pics or newbie questions -- I had no idea so many people had noone to share with in real life.

**How many of us knit mostly alone in a bleak knitting desert?**  
**How many of us knit in an oasis with lots of fertile compnay?**

*Here's some of those eye-opening comments:*

""Here you have instant access to a wide range of knitters, with differing ages, genders and experience-levels…It provides a sense of camaraderie for those of us who don't have friends that knit.""  

""I was happy to find this place because I love knitting and lack a knitting community IRL. I don't have time (and a sitter to mind the kids) to haunt my LYS and my friends and neighbors have different hobbies.""  

""I love seeing FO's from other people, it's fun to share in the excitement and sense of accomplishment when you finally finish something""  

""I actually really love this sub reddit. I have always been sort of a lone(r) knitter with no one but FB and my friends who don't knit to share my triumphs with and now I have all of you!!""  

""I love how I can come here for help! No one that I personally know does magic loop or socks and I can ask before I mess a project up.""  

""The only real life knitters I know are all 65+ and have very different tastes than I do"" :)

1366398808.0	1coy73	Do you have a story about Knitting In The Midst Of Something?	japaneseknotweed	131	18	103	"So I'm in Watertown, trying to decide whether to cast on for socks or a hat. The town is shut down and cordoned off and very very quiet. If you look on the news it's all very dramatic -- but the reality is? It's boring.  

And it feels weird, disloyal, to be bored, because people have died here.  

And four deaths feel pretty big, compared to the small quiet everyday realities of a Boston suburb --   
and at the same time pretty small compared to the amount of death happening in lots less quiet places like Iraq and Afghanistan, Gaza and Chechnya and Mexico and Columbia and pretty much everywhere that's not most of us on r/knitting.  

What's happening here is deep tragedy for a few, but really just inconvenience for *most* of us if you think on a global scale -- no matter what's being hyperventilated on CNN.

It's been a good day to just think, and knit, and one of the thoughts that I keep coming back to is this odd link between life, death, and boredom. If you google any one of those countries plus the word ""knitting"", you'll find images. There are pictures of soldiers knitting in trenches in each of the wars since photography came in, and written descriptions from the wars before that. 

There are stories of people's private little wars -- against cancer, or mental illness, or family crisis -- with knitting woven in.  The most basic ""battle"" of all, the fight that it takes a mother to get a baby into the world, often comes with long boring waiting...and knitting.  

___


&gt;On the Western Front – when once you had accepted the fantastic conditions of it, and the simple fact that there was no guarantee of its stability – life became occasional periods of overwhelming leisure. Leisure which could become boredom of the most hideous sort, for it was enjoyed, of course, before a background of incessant fear or utter despair. In such leisure any man with a secret entertainment for himself which required no cumbersome equipment or instruments or tools, was lucky. A friend of mine, a great footballer and a very brilliant pianist took up – very seriously – knitting. His mother sent him a parcel of books, wool, and the measurements of his young sister who was still at school. Before he was killed he had completed and sent home a two-piece suit – skirt and jumper…

*-- from a radio address by Richard Blaker, 1930* 

&gt;It often comforteth me to think that, even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.  

*-- Brynden Blackfish Tully, Game of Thrones*

So what's your waiting-in-the-midst-of story?  
When has knitting carried you through the eye of the storm, the boredom in the midst of a battle either epic or everyday?  
When have you used knitting to make your own little pool of calm when the world gets turbulent around you, whether you were stuck in a maelstrom or a wading pool? "	t5_2qiu0	True

I used the incredibly helpful www.doctorwhoscarf.com as my guide, but made my own adjustments (mainly I used larger needles and casted on fewer stitches to try to avoid having to block it afterwards). I went into this not knowing if I could even remember how to knit, let alone finish a project this big, so I considered this my ""practice scarf"" and just used plain old WalMart quality yarn.

1358457295.0	16rvpc	Why I will definitely be ordering from Jimmy Beans Wool again	THE_DINOSAUR_QUEEN	121	11	27	"This is long, so if you don't have time just read the last paragraph.

A few weeks ago, I ordered a ball of yarn, deciding I wanted to get into lace knitting. I was looking for a specific yarn, and found myself on jimmybeanswool.com. I'd remembered recommendations from other to this sit, so I decided to see if they had the yarn I wanted. Surprise! They did, in the color I wanted. Even better, it was on sale. I immediately ordered a ball, happy to start lace knitting.

Unfortunately, a few days later, I got an email that they had accidentally sent the yarn to the wrong person. This happens a lot, and I wasn't mad. It gave me more time to finish the project I was currently working on, and I forgot about it quickly.


Strangely, a few days later, I got a JBW package in my mail. I was happy to have my yarn, so I didn't question it as I cast on for a pretty shawl I'd wanted to try. I was pleased with the speedy service, although it was a bit strange that it had taken only a few days for yarn to be sent back then reshipped to me.

A few days later, I got another email, saying that my yarn had shipped. I hadn't ordered anything else, since I was still working on the shawl, so I figured that the email was sent to the wrong person. That is, until today, when I found another JBW package in my mail. I first thought it was for someone else had gotten their order mixed up with mine, so I didn't open the bag in case it needed to be sent back. Instead, I checked the order history on my account, since the address and name were both correct. No new orders. Since I didn't know what was going on, I called the number on the site and was connected to customer service within a few minutes. I spoke with the woman for a few minutes, and she said I could open the bag and take out the sales receipt so I could tell her the order ID. I did so, noticing that the yarn was the same kind and color as I had previously ordered. I mentioned this to her, and she checked the number before explaining what had happened.

The person who got my order had sent it back to 
jbw, where it was shipped to me, but not before JBW sent me a replacement ball. So now I had the replacement ball, which was the one I got first, and the original ball, which I had just gotten. I asked if I should send it back and if I would be charged for it (my biggest concern, because although the yarn was lovely, I didn't want to spend my extra money on a ball I had gotten by accident). The customer service rep told me no, I didn't have to send it back and that it wouldn't be charged, it was on them.

In all, I was VERY pleased with JBW for this. When they heard that the yarn had been sent to the wrong person, the immediately sent a new ball, same color and style. The customer service was very helpful and it only too a few minutes to get everything sorted out. I was surprised that they let me keep the ball free of charge, and very pleased with the whole experience. Because of all of this, I can now definitely say that I will order more yarn from JimmyBeansWool in the future, thanks to their wonderful service and high-quality yarn."	t5_2qiu0	True

I'm very excited to get going on all of these projects! /u/TenMinutesIsAlliNeed and I will be working hard on all the planning and will announce the first project on January 1st, 2013! I'll be putzing around here the next few weeks, looking at all the Secret Santa gifts you're giving and getting (I plan on making some neat things!) and the sweet things you're making for gifts for loved ones. Have a wonderful weekend, everyone! [You're all so very grand!](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/87/224614442_866c9affed.jpg)***

Since there was interest in a Face Your Fears series, I've decided to take it on after hearing your thoughts and ideas. I've been offered help by /u/TenMinutesIsAlliNeed, so she will be pitching ideas to me and collaborating with me to make this as stress-free as possible! Very glad I've got a helper. She's already given me some great ideas!

I know it's a busy knitting season right now, so this won't start until after the holidays. I was thinking January. I know some of you thought that a month wasn't enough time and I think someone suggested 3 months for each, which I feel is too long. I've made a [survey for everyone to take](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/M2RQKC6) as a vote on a few things. 

The topics will be (not in any particular order):

Steeking

Felting

Socks

DPNs/Circulars (try the one you *don't* prefer or have the most trouble with)

Entrelac

Fair Isle

Double Knitting

Cables

Lace

Different stitches

**ADDED**

Brioche

Short rows

Increases/decreases

Grafting

Colorwork

Sweaters/clothing

Knit-crochet fusion

***What's your opinion on novelty yarn?***


If there's any other knitting fear you may have and would like to see it on here, or if you've got other ideas to make this series better/more fun/whatever, please, please please let us know. We're open to criticism and would love to hear it. 

Edit: Entrelac twice. Derp.

**Edit 2**

After seeing some suggestions from the survey, there have been some good ideas.  Some that I really like:

* A small selection of patterns (3-4) chosen by users that are very familiar with the topic.

* maybe an easy and an advanced recommended pattern, but encourage folks to do another pattern if they have always wanted to do ""this"" project in said technique

* Regarding allotted time: every month for techniques, two months for more complicated/time consuming projects



In regard to time frame, I feel that we don't need to completely finish a project. Just because you haven't finished it doesn't mean you failed the challenge. I think that as long as you have learned something and have done yourself proud, you've faced your fear and accomplished something. I carry around my stupid little deathflake swatch everywhere. I love that I actually did it and I love shoving it in non-knitters' faces since they don't know how to do it. [How I basically do this](http://imgur.com/4xJhm). It's normal to have a few WIPs and to have to set them aside for life events. And hey, what if the fear right after it coincides with the one you're working on? Awesome, right? :)

Come find your match over at the [Crochet Signup Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/crochet/comments/16phw7/the_great_crochetforknit_swap_signup_crosspost/)!

SIGNUPS ARE OVER! Matching will happen ASAP over this weekend! I'm doing all the matching by hand with a random number generator, so please be patient! &lt;3

* **Deadline for Sign-up:** January 31st
* **Matching:** February 1st
* **Deadline for Shipping:** Various (see below)

Due to the expansive nature of these two hobbies, I've divided this exchange into three categories: The one-skein wonders, The hobbyists, and the Maniacs. This will (hopefully) help you get matched up with someone of a similar budget and skill level. Please pick the category that you find suits you best! Fill out the form below, and post it in this thread. I will organize the matches at the end of the month. Tell your friends, tell your grandma! It's gonna be a good time!

**The One-Skein Wonders:** *Shipping Deadline: April 1st*
&gt;The One-Skein Wonders may be the lightweight category, but do not underestimate them! This category is exactly what it sounds like- You're limited to one skein. It's less time, less commitment, and is 100% do-able! Beginners, busy moms, dudes with dayjobs, and broke university folk are welcome here.
Wishlist ideas may include: amigurumi, mittens, socks, hair accessories, cozies, hats, knick-knacks of all kinds, lacy kerchiefs, doilies... Any piece with a low yardage!


**The Hobbyists:** *Shipping Deadline: June 1st*
&gt;Hobbyists are willing to work on slightly bigger projects, perhaps invest in a little nicer yarn, and have a fairly strong grasp of a variety of techniques. Hobbyists are somewhere between ""what is yarn"" and ""expert Grandma who has been doing this for 70 years"". This category mostly exists to open up the ""Almighty Scarf"" as a project. (most scarfs just aren't long enough with only one skein!)
Wishlist ideas may include: Any of the above, plus scarves, easier shawls, leg or arm warmers, advanced technique projects... Really, anything can go here, because a smaller project could be worked in a really nice yarn, or a larger one in a more affordable blend.

**The Maniacs:** *Shipping Deadline: August 1st
&gt;Have you bought Madeline Tosh on more than one occasion? Have you given everyone you know a queen-sized comforter? Were you recently injured and are now bedridden with oodles of spare time? Welcome to the Maniacs. For some reason, the idea of creating an entire sweater for a stranger thrills you in ways you can't imagine. Are you mad? Are you the only sane one here? Are you a glimpse at the future for the ""rest of us"" who haven't been buried alive beneath our yarn stashes? This category is for you crazy few, and I will not be disappointed if this category isn't even touched during this exchange. It's too much for my brain to even think about.
Wishlist ideas may include: Anything, oh god! Blankets! Sweaters! Full-body suits! His-and-hers matching knitted castles."	t5_2qiu0	True

It wasn't my first choice, as an young boy the last thing I wanted to do was learn how to knit... and I was the only one there. So I sat on Thursday afternoons with my history teacher and enjoyed it so much that I've kept it up for just over 10 years now.
Before heading off to university, I decided to travel a bit. Since I was going on my own, what I needed was a silent companion to keep me company. The logical choice was a childhood favourite, and so I created my Clanger. We've been together for 4 years now, and havn't spent a night separated, which initially puzzled my girlfriend, until I made her a pink elephant.

I made this cardigan for my closest friend. She loves grey colors, and she loves horses- even though she is seriously allergic.

I fount this 100% merino wool on sale about a month ago. It is just so wonderfully soft. And they had exactly one skein of dark grey - perfect for this horse chart I have long wanted to knit. Although the chart was a little to big for the cardigan, which is why it is located on the lower back. 
Other then making sure it would fit a size medium and placing the chart, I improvised the rest of the cardigan. It got the black stripes because I didn't have enough light grey, but I think it works nicely.
It has saddle shoulders to minimize sewing at the end. 
I have to say I am surprised as to how well it turned out, considering how little effort I put into calculating anything.

I finished it in 14 days! 
My fried loves it, I just gave it to her today. And it fits perfectly.

During the last year more and more of them got excited about it. This was already more then I expected when I started out with knitting at my work :)

My work also has a ceramic workshop. I tried to convince them that if they could make yarnbowls their work group would have a new project while my own knitting group could really use these bowl. We could help each other!

Today the first four (two for me, and they are mine, all mine) samples where completed. I rushed to the store to pick them up and took pictures :D

The pattern is [Slanted Sleeven](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/slanted-sleeven) from ANKESTRICK, and I knitted it in this delightfully springy mystery hand-painted wool I bought several years ago from a weaving gallery (I think it's [Weaving Southwest](http://www.weavingsouthwest.com/)) in Taos. Buttons are plain yellow pearlized plastic from Joann Fabrics, but I'm looking for turquoise ones to replace them if possible in keeping with the New Mexico theme.

The pattern is written in an unusual style, but it is actually pretty logical once you spend some time with it. I loved the set-in sleeves, but next time I would do mirrored increases--I just can't think of a good reason for not doing that. I also really like the cleverness of the incorporated i-cord button band. I liked the look of the 'waist shaping' so I continued it down the back of the sweater, but it did make it a little small in the hips for me, so I'm thinking I'll give it to my mother who is a little smaller all around.

Basically it was a hugely enjoyable knit and I can't wait to make another garment.

With thanks to /u/vallary and /u/theshrewd, who took the time to answer my questions about shoulder shaping.

I'm kind of burnt out on making things for other people to see it go unappreciated and unused. It seems like for at least the past two years I've produced so much, and have so little to show for it, so with only the smallest amount of guilt, I'm putting my foot down and saying 2013 will be MY year! I will knit what I want, when I want, and with the colors and brands I want all for myself!! Even writing this out makes me feel a little rush of excitement!
So I'm sure I won't stick completely to this and will still make things for my immediate family and such, but under my terms and not just for anyone. I can be kind of, um, well...a doormat at times, letting people take advantage of me too much; I'm trying hard to work on being more assertive and I'm kind of hoping that The Year of Selfish Knitting will help me with that, with learning that it is completely okay just  say no to people sometimes!
Okay rant part over! Anyway, I really want to get started with a project but I just can't pick something and all of the gorgeous patterns I see on Revelry aren't helping me narrow it down any. What I'd like from you amazing knitters are pattern suggestions please!!!! What are some of the patterns that you absolutely love and would highly recommend? I know that can be a very broad list so to keep it small I will say please keep it to small projects, no sweaters or blankets....just yet (maybe that will be my end of year project!).

What started out as a sort of joke turned out to be a process growth. My girlfriend who is always cold and has a deep (sometimes disturbing) love for blankets was promised a blanket. For her only the biggest and warmest of blankets would do. Double strings of the thickest (affordable) yarn where selected. Almost 30 skeins and one eternity later led up to this afternoon. With shaking hands I started to cast off the last row. I sat in silence for some time before it was folded and the beast was bound with a green lint, nice big bow on top. Below are two pictures of the blanket. Our cat, the Persian princess, Plume would not pose next to it again. I'm afraid all the times I had to warn her away from it has made her a bit hesitant to relax on it yet :)

We all know there's safety in numbers.  

What say we try something scary, together, in honor of All Hallows Eve and its spectres?

That's the [Deathflake](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/search#pattern-link=deathflake-chart&amp;view=cards) over there.   
The chart is [here](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/deathflake-chart), it's [free](http://reliquaryarts.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/deathflakechart.pdf), and it's only 29 stitches wide.  

If you've always been terrified of Fairisle, here's a chance to take on your two-color demons. Make an ipod cozy, a potholder, [a lovely lavender sachet](http://redd.it/126afb) or just a square -- it can always become a pocket on something later.  

Not into Fairisle, or already comfy with it? Choose your own adventure -- four inches of cable, a new cast-on, a tiny scrap of lace -- and next week we can post the results in all their ~~gory~~ glory.  

One long FO thread of mangled scraps and tortured samples -- what could be more fitting?  


**edit 1: all hail [mycathatesyou](http://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/11zqsi/see_that_sidebar_halloween_is_coming_you_have_one/c6r5bnd)**, who got one done first **BUT** 

**NEW --Edit 1a: the number of FO pics is getting a little high, can we wait and make one big thread on the day after Halloween? It'd be kinda cool to be able to compare all of our variations at once, and the non-flakers won't feel so crowded. I'll post it as a sticky link at the top, even -- so can we hold off?**

edit 2: ok, I just have to say this: I just figured out how to make a sticky. That grey announcement thing up there. Knitting doesn't bother me at all, but CSS? It's been spooking me a lonnng time."	t5_2qiu0	True
