If an open faced sandwich is in fact a sandwich, then so is bruchetta, garlic bread with cheese, maybe even pizza. Thoughts?

edit: Lots of good info in here. I think I may have found the answer to the open faced sandwich question in [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) wiki article. The open faced sandwich is derived from a completely different line than what we call a sandwich: ""During the Middle Ages, thick slabs of coarse and usually stale bread, called ""trenchers"", were used as plates. After a meal, the food-soaked trencher was fed to a dog or to beggars, or eaten by the diner. Trenchers were the precursors of open-face sandwiches.[3] The immediate cultural precursor with a direct connection to the English sandwich was to be found in the Netherlands of the 17th century,"""	t5_2s643	True

Here's a tip I've made.

Sandwiches need texture as much as they need flavour. For example, a wet, soggy sandwich is unpleasant.

For my perfect sandwich it needs to have the following criteria;

* Crunch

* Body

* Smush

* Whisk

* Thunk

**Crunch** can be given by things like lettuce, tomatoes or crisps. They give something for your teeth to know they've entered the sandwich and when they've left. It's something for your molars to give you that soft shuddering vibration as you bite through.

**Body** is texture for your tongue. It can vary from seeds to olives, to cherry tomatoes. Body is small (often round) semi-hard to semi-soft objects which you can guide around your mouth with your tongue.

**Smush** is texture for your teeth, tongue and gums. Smush is made by onion marmalade or the interaction of butter and bread. Smush is also peanut butter. It's a thick coating of soft material which you can clean up after each bite and savour flavour on your tongue.

**Whisk** is creamy material, such as butter, salad cream and mayonnaise. It should be encountered in liquid form and acts as the d-day landers for your bite into your sandwich.

**Thunk** can be things like hard cheese, thick cut ham or lettuce. It's a texture for your teeth which is almost like a slow slicing action. It should slow the speed of the bite after the initial speed of entering the bread. Thunk which is too strong can wreck a sandwich (salami meats don't break, and can be pulled from the sandwich ending in a sandwich disaster).

Just my opinions on sandwich textures. What are yours?

**EDIT**

People wanted me to expand on smush, and I have down in the comments. Reposting it in the main for everyone;

*Bread can also be smush. Basically, when it enters your mouth, the smush will be one of the first flavours that come through because the item does not need chewing to develop taste.*

*Things like pesto, ketchup, salad dressing, bacon fats.*

*These are mostly liquids and they will imbue the bread, which becomes 'smush' when mixed with the sauces and your saliva. This causes the bread to adhere to the mouth so that the flavouring is the first and last thing you taste from each bite.*"	t5_2s643	True

1312303369.0	j6tp5	I was told you guys might like to know how my Grandfather made sandwiches (x-post from r/cooking)	sucom	100	8	20	"I present to you: Sandwiches like my Grandfather made them.

Ingredients:

* olive oil 
* italian dressing 
* lettuce
* tomato
* olives (i prefer black)
* jalapenos
* onion
* oregano and any other spices you want
* parmesan
* mustard
* hard salami
* turkey
* ham
* pastrami
* meunster
* provolone
* cheddar
* mozzarella

Note: use whatever meats and cheeses you like, I switch it up but the ones I listed are my favorites. Though he did say not to use Swiss because it is strong and can overpower the other flavors.  Also said hard salami is a must-have.

Prepare the sandwich:

* Take a loaf of bread (I prefer italian, and sometimes sweet italian round) and slice it horizontally.
* dig out a good portion of the bread from inside the top half forming a canoe, and maybe a little from the bottom half.
* make a mixture of olive oil and salad dressing with a 1 to 1 ratio.  spread this mixture over the top half of the bread until the top is coated
* layer the meats and cheeses alternating.  I go with hard salami -&gt; meunster -&gt; turkey -&gt; provolone -&gt; ham -&gt; chedder -&gt; pastrami -&gt; mozzarella
* (optional, I do not do this) throw the sandwich in the oven if you want
* add vegetables
* top with mustard, oregano and parmesan

1337008056.0	tmiz2	Re-reading Mostly Harmless.  Douglas Adams on making a sandwich.	puppeteer107	92	13	9	"There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound: choosing the right bread, for instance. The Sandwich Maker had spent many months in daily consultation and experiment with Grarp the Baker and eventually they had created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, while still being light, moist and having the best of that fine nutty flavor which best enhanced the savor of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh.

There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the precise relationships between the width and height of the slice and also its  thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to the finished sandwich -- here again, lightness was a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity and that promise of succulence and savor that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience.

The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the Baker at his  oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker, weighing and balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness,  strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and many was the  evening when the Sandwich Maker and the Tool Maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the Tool Maker's forge making slow sweeping movements through the air, trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with the balance of another, the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a fourth.

Three knives altogether were required. First, there was the knife for the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade, which imposed a  clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading  knife, which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread.

The chief among the knives, of course, was the carving knife. This was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium  through which it moved, as did the bread knife. It must work with it, be guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most  exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat. The Sandwich Maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist onto the beautifully proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary  slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, and the main act of creation would now be accomplished. "	t5_2s643	True
