Produced by Walter Wanger (Stagecoach, Invasion of the Body Snatchers)

Starring Edward G. Robinson (Little Caesar, Double Indemnity)

A meek aspiring painter is having a mid-life crisis.  One rainy night, he rescues a beautiful young woman from her abusive boyfriend.  But when he presents himself as wealthy and successful, her boyfriend begins to scheme... what can they get out of this well meaning man, and how far will he go for the woman he is rapidly becoming enamored with?

This film is full of pathos, with a great performance by Robinson, who is playing against type.  Lang's direction once again defines the noir style. The cinematography is excellent here, the dark lighting and menacing camera shots mix in with the dreary atmosphere perfectly.

The various story lines are flawless and intermingle in such a way that you, as the expectator/judge/explorer, become an actor. At times it reminds me of those ""how many triangles are in this picture"" type puzzles.

Everybody then watches Turner Classic together and tweet about the film... sometimes it's making fun of something going on in the background, sometimes there will be serious backstory to how the film was made. Everyone meets and tweets under hashtag **#TCMParty**.

And there's the Drive-In Mob, too (**@DriveInMob**). They meet every Thursday at 8pm EST. They specialize in films you'd see curled up with your lady (or gent) at, well, a drive-in! Usually two films a night and they use YouTube to watch their movies, so everyone can join in. On special occasions they'll team with TCMParty.

Anyone here already tweeting along with these people? If not, you should try it.

The first thing that jumped out at me for the film was that Andrew Garfield would be perfect for the role of Norman Bates if they were to remake Psycho.

The second thing that jumped out at me was that a remake would be pointless, as Psycho has aged perfectly (I'm 19 and I loved it!), if they remade it, any changes made would detract from the original film.

1270055198.0	bkrh3	The Night of The Hunter - 1955 (i highly recommend this film)	stroud	11	2	7	"The Night of the Hunter is a 1955 American crime film directed by Charles Laughton and starring Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters.[1] The film is based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Davis Grubb, adapted for the screen by James Agee and Laughton. The novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers, hanged in 1932 for the murders of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The film's lyric and expressionistic style sets it apart from other Hollywood films of the 1940s and 50s, and it has influenced later directors such as David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Terrence Malick, Jim Jarmusch, Harmony Korine, the Coen brothers, and Spike Lee.

wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_Hunter_(film) imdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048424/

I personally recommend this film for those who have not seen this. For me, it is (I believe) in the same caliber of Citizen Kane if not better.

&gt; mass had to be guided with a strong hand by a responsible elite. 
&gt; Let us not forget that in TV we have the greatest instrument for
&gt; mass persuasion in the history of the world."" 

- General Haynesworth, A Face in the Crowd.

I sometimes suppose European redditors have to be a little perplexed by some of America's more self-destructive eccentricities: our denigration of educators, contempt for intellectuals, celebration of sleaze, condoning of religious con-men, and above all, our election of George W. Bush. If baffled you are, let me suggest this classic film might offer some insight. In a country without princes, the only Arcana left is The Fool. And in [""Face in the Crowd,""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050371/) we get to see how exhilarating, and how terrible, this archetype can be.

""A Face in the Crowd"" tells the story of Lonesome Rhodes, a vagabond from the apocryphal town of Riddle who happens to be possessed with a thunderous charisma. Discovered in a small-town jail by an ambitious radio producer, he seems to cast a spell over everyone who hears his voice.  And once that voice goes out on the airwaves, his ascendancy is unstoppable. To give away too many details about his rise to power would spoil all the fun, though. Suffice it to say that as we follow him on his rise we get to see the dots connected between the folk hero, the media, the advertising business, politics, mass culture, sex, the powerful, the greedy, and the humble poor. And despite having been made more than half a century ago, it's still a remarkably contemporary film. After watching it, Sarah Palin might seem like just another shabby Hollywood remake.

But most of all, see it for Andy Griffith's performance as Lonesome Rhodes, which I'd argue is every bit as astonishing as Heath Ledger's in The Dark Knight. It's a rare actor who can make a character simultaneously so appealing and so abhorrent, and Griffith dominates the role (his first film role, in fact). If your only knowledge of this actor is as some amiable black-and-white blur on Nick at Night reruns, prepare to have your jaw drop. 

Not available on Netflix Instant, unfortunately, but enterprising film fans shouldn't have too much trouble finding their way to a copy.

&gt;""Believe me, Lonesome Rhodes is on one shoulder, and he's goin, 
&gt; ""Tell them to follow you!""

1291914560.0	ej0lo	Getting my classic film nut lately, and now I'm becoming more and more interested in 'Old Hollywood'.  Any good book/reading recommendations?	cariboulou	12	1	12	"For about four years now, I've made a concerted effort to watch what are considered ""the best"" movies.  However, for whatever reason, I stayed away from the classical Hollywood era, the studio era, Bogart-Grant-Stewart-et al era, etc.  Recently though (the last week and a half really), I've been plundering the iTunes classic movie rentals because I can't get enough of the golden era.

Here's what I've seen:

The Third Man

The Treasure of Sierra Madre

The Bicycle Thief

Roman Holiday

To Catch a Thief

The Maltese Falcon

Sabrina

Chinatown

North by Northwest

(For good measure, I've watched Time Bandits, The Rainmaker, The Jerk, The Thing, In Bruges, Blue Velvet, and Oldboy over the course of the semester as well.)

Basically, I've seen the better part of imdb's top 250, maybe all of Reddit's top 250, and probably the top 50 of r/classicfilms' pre-1990 list.  Been putting work in.

However, I'm not posting for movie recommendations.  I can handle that myself.  Reading these movies' wikipedia pages, I have become really interested in the people in the movie industry at this time (the male/female stars, the directors, the studios, etc).  I want to read about this time period more, and perhaps the transition to the New Hollywood era while I'm at it. Are there any comprehensive books/websites that offer this history?

The reason is pretty lame: Ava Gardner was Mickey Rooney's first spouse and this is the film that launched her to stardom. Mickey Rooney's still alive and I follow his unofficial tweets for fun. It's just awesome to still live in a time when someone from the classics is still with us. 


Then might get some random public-domain noirs from Open Flix.

I don't remember the movie's entire plot, or even remotely what its title is, so it's pretty difficult to search for. What I remember is that it had sound, so it was after the era of silent films, but it was black-and-white and the film quality was fairly poor - I'm thinking it was made sometime between the late '20s into early 40s. 

The scene I remember focuses on two children, who may or may not be the main characters of the film, but at one point they are in a graveyard, and then end up in a strange land where human souls exist before they are born into this world. The film had a very fantastical / surrealist feel to it. I wish I knew more details about the rest of the film, as I've had no luck figuring out what movie this scene comes from.

DJWhamo	7	1	5	"I was reading an article in my local free paper about a film called [Trouble in Paradise](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023622/), which is being screened at one of the independent theaters in my area.  It talked about how the film was released just before the [Motion Picture Production Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code) started being enforced, and the immediate effect it had on films at the time.  So, really, I guess I have two questions

A man and his wife live in a high-rise type of apartment and the wife's friend lives downstairs from them.  The husband is cheating with this downstairs friend, and they're making prank calls with death threats to the wife.  There's a policeman or reporter involved, who saves the day in the end.  There's also a guy towards the end of the movie who breaks into the apartment (or maybe only attempts to).

For some strange reason an old scene from Laurel and Hardy has made it's way back in my head and I can't seem to find it anywhere, or even the title of the movie. I was hoping you guys can give me the title.

The scene I remember are: Laurel and Hardy start off on shore with their new boat (this is not the ""saps at sea"", I checked), when they set sail they have dinner together but there is a thief hidden in the sails that keeps stealing their food without them noticing, when they find him it turns out he's a chef, I also remember that there is a huge storm during their trip, and I think towards the end they make their way on an island and Hardy falls in love with a woman.

I'm not too sure about the details, it's been more than 15 years since I've seen it.

Do any of you guys know the title of this movie?

Basically the only information I have to go by is that the movie is:

* Old, probably pre-60s
* Black-and-white
* The plot centers around a poor playwright who is struggling near the beginning of the movie
* At some point, the playwright writes a play named ""Murder Afoot"" or something similar to that, and starts becoming more successful

That's all I know, unfortunately. Does anyone know what it might be, or have suggestions on where to go looking for it if not?

I can't figure out the right combination of google searches to find this film.  It's set in pre-Revolutionary America featuring a platoon of troops (I think an American contingent of British troops or perhaps full-fledged Redcoats) pursued by Indians.  They split up into multiple groups and unpleasant things happen to many of them.  Not much is shown on screen but there is a particularly vivid spoken account of a soldier's beheading and the Indians playing soccer with his head.  The remnants of the platoon make it to a fort and another platoon raises their flag in honor of the survivors.  I have the impression it was a fairly early film, 1930s or 40s.  It was in color, but pretty vivid and slightly fake looking, like early technicolor.  Some of the details may be off due to memory tricks.  Thanks!	t5_2rjjr	True
1293774606.0	eu1ed	Suggestions on movies about the South Pacific?	plytheman	5	0	2	"I've been reading a lot of sailing books lately, some from as early as the begining of the 20th century, and a lot of them take place in various parts of the South Pacific.  Tahiti, Bora Bora, Fiji... all these romantic sounding tropical islands full of plentiful fruits, beautiful women, sometimes savage head hunters, volcanoes, luaus and hula dances.  Lots of fantastic tales of some of the last wild unkown country on the planet at the time.  I feel like there are movies from back in the day about these exotic places, and would love to watch them (the more true to how life was on the islands back then the better) but don't know where to start.  The only thing that comes to mind atm is *South Pacific*, but maybe there are more?  While I am very interested in what life was like on the islands back before WWII and air travel opened the islands to Western life, I'm just as happy for some classic film romancing and comedy.  You guys have any suggestions on where to start looking?

I do remember that the king or sultan or whatnot was poisoned and died.  

It was in color, it had a Middle Eastern theme, and (I think) a giant egg and (I'm pretty sure) a flying carpet.

This all leads me to believe it was a version of Sinbad or Aladdin.

But believe me when l say that /classicfilms redditors will enjoy this film and what it has to contribute to your preconceptions of B&amp;W cinematography. In many ways, it is timeless like great Classics that we love from decades prior. The film is a very gripping allegorical tale about themes Vietnam War and other revolutionary themes, but I thought it was relevant to this subreddit because Lindsay Anderson decided to shoot in both Color and B&amp;W! This was at first a logistical decision by the director (since the set lighting for color film is difficult/$$$ to setup in certain venues), but later became a deliberate way for Anderson to add ""texture"" to the film. 

I watched it first in my Film as English (college writing 105 essentially) along with other favorites like Gunga Din, The Quiet Man, The Searchers, Some like it Hot, The Philadelphia Story, and others. I LOVED that class.

- **The Criterion Collection** - [http://criterion.com/](http://criterion.com/): ""A continuing series of important classic and contemporary films,"" Criterion has been licensing and releasing quality films for the past 25 years.  With their recent move to Blu-ray, they've continued to uphold their reputation as one of the best in this niche market when it comes to transfer quality and supplements.  With a large catalog dating back to Laserdisc-days, and a DVD catalog of over 500 titles, Criterion is already making a mark with their Blu-ray offerings thus far.  They are primarily a **REGION A** company, but often distribute region free releases, depending on the licensing rights.

- **EUREKA: Masters of Cinema** - [http://eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/bluray/](http://eurekavideo.co.uk/moc/bluray/): A company based in the UK, Eureka started their MoC line on DVD and have recently entered the realm of Blu-ray.  While their catalog is still relatively small, I think it's safe to say that we should expect a stream of high quality releases in the coming months.  As far as I know, these films are released **REGION FREE**.

- **The Studio Canal Collection** - [http://studiocanalcollection.com/](http://studiocanalcollection.com/): A collection of ""iconic films that made the history of cinema. All include outstanding new bonus features and unique packaging that will appeal to cinephiles and film enthusiasts alike.""  So far these releases seem to be hit-or-miss; some are amazing, such as Jean-Luc Godard's *À bout de souffle*, while others like Akira Kurosawa's *Ran* get a mediocre transfer that is hardly an upgrade from the standard definition DVDs.  The Studio Canal Collection has releases in multiple regions, but I believe most titles are **REGION FREE**.

There are plenty of review sites that give detailed video/audio critiques.  Here are a couple of my favorites:

- [Blu Beaver](http://blubeaver.ca): A branch of DVDBeaver, a great site with detailed comparisons across multiple regions.  
- [Blu-ray.com](http://blu-ray.com): A great site and community for Blu-ray enthusiasts.  Contains detailed reviews and screenshots from a majority of the films released.

Some movies I've already seen (and thoroughly enjoyed):

* Freaks 
* West side story
* A tale of two cities 
* Sabrina
* Dumbo and pinocchio 
* Birth of a nation (didn't really enjoy but thought it was fascinating to see how racist people were)
* All about Eve
* Johnny Guitar (so fucking awesome)
* Casablanca
* Gilda
* Gone with the wind
* Camille (complete sidenote but wasn't Moulin Rouge based off this movie?? it doesn't mention it at all in wiki...)

Do you reckon the short version is not a good one to watch the film for the first time ? IS the longer version more detailed and elaborate ? 
Thoughts ? 
Also my two favorite scenes were: 
* De Niro asking Minelli to marry him
* And Minelli telling De Niro she is pregnant !

I wasn't disapointed, but just a bit confused. De Niro was amazing in it !!!

There's a nastiness to Dev that never quite leaves him, and his attitudes towards Alicia's sexuality have darker overtones.  As for Alex, well, it's difficult to outright dislike any Claude Rains' character due to the charm he tends to bring to his roles - but he simply seemed a more engaging character than Dev.

The ending really highlighted this for me.  I felt that I was led to sympathise more with one character than the other, and Dev's actions were downright baffling.  (I'd like to discuss this in more detail - but I can't seem to spoiler tag in this sub-reddit.  No doubt I'm being terribly dim)

I don't know who it was by, or when it was made. It isn't exactly from the Golden Era of Hollywood, but I thought some one here may know it.

The film is Silent, There is a scene in the beginning with a long line of men jumping up and down in slow motion (with umbrellas?).
At some point there is a horse drawn buggy with a casket that is being pulled down the street for a funeral, but it gets detached from the buggy, and it is chased by the camera (and I think people as well) until it ends up in a field and every one gathers around and there is some sort of magic show.

I think I may have watched it in a class geared more towards the Avant Garde, it was a really fun film though. Hopefully someone knows what I am talking about?

The Man Who Laughs (1928) is an American silent film directed by the German Expressionist filmmaker Paul Leni. The film is an adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel of the same name and stars Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine and Mary Philbin as the blind Dea. The film is known for the grim Carnival freak-like grin on the character Gwynplaine's face which often leads the film to be credited to the horror film genre. Film critic Roger Ebert stated ""The Man Who Laughs is a melodrama, at times even a swashbuckler, but so steeped in Expressionist gloom that it plays like a horror film.""

I once saw a TNT Classics film which was about a family of about 5/6 sisters who lived in a house and they were visited by a young man, who wins over the family with his confidence and in spite of his cheekiness, they all grow to like him.

Eventually, another guy shows up who turns out to be his rival and his name is Mickey in the film...

I remember a scene where the first guy is swinging from the picket-fence gate in front of the girls' house and talking to one of the girls. 

In another scene, on his first visit to the girls' house, they all start getting to dinner and he starts pulling out chairs for the sisters and starts seating them, acting as the host himself and they are all amazed by his gall but still find it endearing...

If anyone remembers the movie, please let me know, it was a fave with us siblings about 15 years ago when we saw it as kids - Thanks!"	t5_2rjjr	True

I came across this title when reading an article about satire in film and if this film isn't a great example of satire, I don't know what is.  Chaplin lampoons just about every aspect of American culture in the first half of the film (music, films, commercials, materialism, education etc.) and then really gets critical when he turns to politics (specifically the McCarthy Hearings of the time).  Tough to call this one a great, just because it tries to say a little too much, but once it hones in on it's intended message it really hits home. "	t5_2rjjr	True

I heard that they wanted marylin monroe for the role before audrey and I think that monroe would have done a much better job of playing an eccentric and niave  but sophisticated, glamourous and sexy prostitute.

Ignoring ""innovativeness,"" What's the genuine best film of all time?"	parisologist	2	3	2	"Sure, Kane is the most *revolutionary* film ever made, but innovativeness is an extrinsic determination (made by comparing it with its contemporaries), not an intrinsic quality. That's why we always have to explain to people *why* Citizen Kane is great. I'd argue that ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Seven Samurai"" are better films, if we only consider what's on the screen and not the historical context.

My personal vote for best would be Lawrence of Arabia, for its epic story, subtle editing, outstanding writing, and haunting imagery. The greatest film one of the greatest directors.
