Thanks for the discourse, just wanted refine my whole view of it.
""Just ask for a gift card"" is not the solution - I don't want to worry about spending a gift card. I don't want a monetary exchange. I also don't want to have to worry about exceeding or equalling another's monetary gift.

A $6.50 container of Balkan yogurt costs me about $1 to produce with &lt;1 hour of labor. By batching production, it's more than worth my time to produce; plus it's fun and sciencey. 

I'm tired of buying over-processed crap that can easily be hand made as it has for thousands of years. I like controlling what goes into my body. I admit this reduces but does not eliminate my dependency on consumerism.

Also, by sharing it with friends and family, I'm strengthening real human relationships instead of strengthening dependency on some corporation that is far more concerned with getting me to buy yogurt than making it healthy or tasty.

What's really amazing is how my friends are surprised making yogurt is so easy. Look it up on Google. If a peasant in Bulgaria with no concept of bacteria could make it 1,000 years ago, surely you can do it too.

Basic instructions:

1. Buy the last container of yogurt you will ever need (how ironic you need to do this in order to be independent). Make sure it's as plain and pure as possible. Balkan style is best IMO.

2. Heat milk (preferably local, hormone free) to 85C for 5 minutes.

3. Cool milk to 43C and add 2 tbsp room-temperature yogurt per liter milk as a starter culture. Stir well.

4. Cover vessel with foil (good insulator) and place it a warm space for 8 hours. An oven with the light on works great.

5. Stir yogurt, place in fridge, and strain through cheesecloth or tea towel for 2-3 hours to thicken yogurt. I like to strain ~40% of the volume off for ideal thickness (i.e., 1 L milk makes 600 mL yogurt).

Note: Always save a little bit as starter for your next batch.

Now you have healthy and tasty yogurt for the cost of milk plus a little electricity/gas for the rest of your life. Holy hell, was that so hard?

Next week, granola. What else does /r/anticonsumption make rather than buy?

**EDIT**: So I just found out that Danone Canada lost a class action lawsuit over advertising, which corroborates the notion that some corporation really is most interested in getting me to buy yogurt. Anyone in Canada who purchased their yogurt from April 2009 to November 2012 (e.g., me) is eligible for $30 compensation or $100 if you have a grocery bill. Thanks for misleading us; it paid for my thermometer, starter culture, and several liters of milk, ensuring I never need to buy from you again.

1374008639.0	1ifuia	Achievement unlocked: I'm no longer captivated by shiny things on sale! I just kept $60 in my pocket during my lunch break.	inquiringmindsfap	120	18	39	"I used to be the ultimate superficial consumerist.  I always bought the latest expensive fashions, and thought nothing of dropping some serious dough on expensive mall-brand beauty items. I work in a conservative office where everyone is in their 20s and 30s and make decent money. The women love to show off their luxury-brand purses and shoes, and it's obvious to me that they derive at least some self-worth from these purchases.   

I endeavored to educate myself, and have majorly reduced my egoic need for fluffy brand names.  Even though I love to dress nicely (nobody likes a slob), I secretly protested the consumerism with my purse and shoes.  I have a plain brown shoulder purse from Banana Republic that I got from a Goodwill.  It's plain as plain can be, and modestly worn down from about 3 years of daily use.  I NEVER change my purse (unless traveling when I need a bigger bag).  I also have plain black Calvin Klein pumps that have also lasted me for 3 years (wear about 4x a week).  One day my cat chewed on the tip a little bit.  It didn't even phase me, and I've kept on wearing them.  Take that, superficial women! I won't play your game! 

So I've learned to slowly temper down my buying habits. But today I had that marvelous breakthrough moment, where I was truly anti-consumptive (is that even a word?).  So there is this great Bath and Body Works shower cream that I love to use, which I'm almost out of.  I'm at the mall during my lunch break, and go to that store to pick up some more.  I find my cream and look at the label... $15.00.  I didn't even think about it, I just put it in my basket and resigned myself to the purchase.  Then I saw a sign ""Buy 2 get 1 free!"".  I thought... Oooooh, free stuff!  Then I actively searched for the other thing I had to buy to get my free item, and then searched for the free item I'd get.  I put all 3 things in my basket.  

So then I'm walking around some more, and found a good smelling candle.  I picked it up and put it in my basket. I'm walking towards the register, and realize that my initial $15 purchase had just turned into almost $60!  AND I was going to put it on my almost maxed-out credit card.  I put the candle back.  Then I looked at the remaining items... my coveted shower cream plus two other lotions to add to my already bulging pile of creams/lotions at home.  I realized that I was going to spend $35 (cost of 2 items) to save $12 (cost of free item)!!   

I gingerly put back all 3 items. I realized that this store almost sucked away $60 of my hard earned cash, without me even noticing! I don't need more creams or lotions! As a matter of fact, I'm going to challenge myself not to need any more fancy shower cream. Yes, it makes shaving a breeze.  But you know what ... $15 on shower cream... I just can't do it anymore. And I won't.  

So from now on I'm going to use my regular store-brand Vitamin E soap from Whole Foods that costs $1.50... it's soft and sumptous, and even though it's not as great as that shower cream... I just don't care anymore.  I will make my skin soft with olive oil. And I'm going to stop allowing those stores to play their dirty tricks and schemes on me. 

Money in my pocket!

TLDR: Today I turned from a mindless consumer to a conscious consumer.  "	t5_2r83n	True

1374673457.0	1iye4n	A modest proposal for /r/anticonsumption: ban memes	eobanb	113	22	17	"I've been on reddit for about 6.5 years and I've watched a lot of once-quality subreddits like /r/atheism go way, way, way downhill from an influx of memes, comics, quotepics, and so on. I'll just refer to these collectively as memes.

My concern is not that memes themselves are bad. They're not inherently bad. They can be funny and/or downright insightful. But what they do is gradually push the level of discourse down; more worryingly, there's a distinct 'ripple effect' from memes that turns even non-meme posts into joke threads and circlejerks. Most memes don't actually convey an idea that isn't equally viable in text form—one might even argue they're just a 'lazy' way of posting instead of bothering to write up an original, thought-out post.

Now I'm not saying that /r/anticonsumption is anywhere near the state of /r/atheism right now. I really love this sub for that exact reason. But it's also becoming more and more popular (coming up on 20k!), and with popularity comes growing pains.

So here's my proposal: let's seriously consider banning memes and quotepics. At the very least I think it's worth a discussion."	t5_2r83n	True

job destruction via technology:

“At the height of its power, the photography company Kodak employed more than 140,000 people and was worth $28 billion. They even invented the first digital camera. But today Kodak is bankrupt, and the new face of digital photography has become Instagram. When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people. Where did all those jobs disappear? And what happened to the wealth that all those middle-class jobs created?” -Jaron Lanier

whatever this is:

""Can you imagine what would happen if all of America stopped buying so much unnecessary fluff that doesn’t add a lot of lasting value to our lives?
The economy would collapse and never recover.""

digital education/college
(which is easier to embrace when people's primary motive in education is learning, instead of securing a job) = less debt, fewer jobs, and not having to study something you don't love

stress:

less stress at work, stress trying to find work, stress in college to get a degree, stress (and money) commuting to work, stress from co-workers, deadlines, bosses, social expectations about jobs, it goes on and on. society isn't better off producing more widgets, we're better off not living a stressful life. 

and that new jobs being created (except medical) are marginal benefits to society, or in some cases nearly useless

these factors appear to lead to a society with fewer jobs, less consumption, and more free time. What could this world look like? a post-money world?

I've read every reply and it's been very interesting.**

Are most of you professionals/post-professionals sitting about in your lovely edible gardens in the countryside? Young people flailing around hopelessly like me? Freegan squatters on vintage computers? Average people who consume a bit less and more tastefully? What's your story?

I feel trapped sometimes. When I quit my fast food job in high school after learning about the horrible business practices compounded my dislike of that type of work, it was fine and a relief. Now I'm a bit older it's not so fine to mess around like that with employment opportunities, and it's not so fun to question consumption norms when all your friends suddenly have money.

I don't even know any more. I'm a drop in the ocean. I'm not against consumption per se, just the waste and what drives and enables the glut of it. I resent being made to want things to be confident and happy, and I resent having to work as a facilitator and an ambassador of unethical exploitation again just to feel respected and earn my keep. 

But being largely normal is in my best interests, as much as I vainly try to think of insane or brilliant alternatives I know must exist somewhere right now if only I were more financially strategic or socially connected or proactive. I don't want to become one of those thirty-five-year-old long term unemployed professional protesters who seem like they're straining really hard to be positive. I don't want to cry to that Teen Idle song in ten years. I don't want to seem alienating. If I'm to find a meaningful occupation to help change the world and all that shit then I'll have to sacrifice my ideals now. And what a load of wank this must sound. I guess there are things I can do to make the world a better place now, I'm not a drop on the ocean to people around me like I am to the economy."	t5_2r83n	True

My story:
For a few years now, I've curbed my television viewing down to nearly nothing. The past year, I've started to do the same with video games. And the past few weeks, I've started to take on my internet time.

All three of these activities touch on a sense of instant gratification with stunted long-term rewards. And I've noticed the withdrawl of these activities produces the same knee jerk response of buying frivolous goods (or in the case of the internet, literal brain hunger. It scared the crap out of me).

I'm now trying my best to dedicate my time to long form study (books and structured essay collections), creative projects, and non electronic leisure (go outside ;).

It seemed like a natural progression to do so. Obviously the internet is a valuable tool of information. But when used in an aimless fashion, it can be an insane consumption of time. Videogames, though exercising problem solving and story development, have so much repetitive down time that they can become time wasting chores.

Everyday I'm told a new television show I'm supposed to watch or movie I'm to see. A few gamer friends also pressure the purchase of more games/systems. Now, with the rise of social networking we're pressured to constantly surf the web. Moving from one link to the next without a strong urge to sit back, reflect, and analyze what we've learned from the information we consume. Scary stuff."	t5_2r83n	True

Since then I have significantly cut my consumption(riding my bike everywhere, cooking only with mostly unprocessed food, making my own pizzas, and using many great tips on this sub). Occasionally it was hard to break some of the habits of our consumeristic but very convenient society, but the great links and articles always inspired me. 

And the best part? I have saved so much money with the help of y'all and [/r/Frugal](/r/Frugal)  that I am leaving on Wednesday for Central America for the summer.

Actually that probably isn't the best part, the best part is that I have spent the last year exploring the world, reading library books, learning to write science fiction, falling in love with girls over picnics in my local parks, taking long bike rides with my father, and actually living life instead of being locked into our society's silly race for more possessions.

So thanks y'all, keep being awesome and we can live a more fulfilling life and maybe save the world.

I feel like the last thing the planet needs is any goods at all to be made. Even sustainable products. As a sidenote - what do we even want to sustain? If we made sustainable cars, they would still turn our cities into unwalkable suburban nightmares.

There's an attitude, especially on reddit, that it's better to produce than to consume. If you produce, it may use your creative side, but you're still using up resources. Better than both is to make nothing.

And sure, we could invest in efficient goods. But microwaves, ovens, and other such appliances are much more energy-efficient now than in the 1970s. We still are [left with higher overall energy use.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

I see recessions happen and I think *good*. Somehow, world population needs to drop and Westerners and ""developing"" nations need to stop what they are doing.

We don't need green growth. We need all economies to shrink extremely rapidly. I feel like if they don't, we'll have a painful population crash once we hit some serious resource bottlenecks. [The Ogallala aquifer is drying up.](http://harpers.org/blog/2012/06/from-broken-heartland-the-looming-collapse-of-agriculture-on-the-great-plains/) That's one example.

It made me think of one category where P.O. might not be the result of a 'conspiratorial' search for increased profits or by romancing the consumer into desiring the next big thing, but as the result of actual loss of functionality: compute hardware, specifically processing hardware.

For instance, I bought an iPhone 3G back when they were first released in 2008, and kept well past when my contract was done, it was expensive and I wanted to get as much life out of the product as possible, but I have to say, it was an effort. Because smartphones are still something of a nascent market which is still seeing massive innovations, my phone was practically useless even before the contract time was up. Applications would not run, and as software was updated, even basic functions became a struggle. The last 6 months of its life, it was basically a paperweight. Again, I realized that this was because the changes are coming so fast to the devices, I expect my 4S to at least be functional for the next 3 years, if not on the bleeding edge.

Which led me to another thought, I'm coming up on 4 years since the purchase of my Macbook Pro. I splurged and got a pretty beefy model, hardware wise, it shows. As far as I'm concerned, this thing is *almost* as fast and functional as the day I bought it, but there will come a time when some of my larger, more resource heavy programs like database applications and recording software won't run efficiently. (Luckily I'm not a ""gamer"" or my computers would only last 6 months.) No matter what condition the hardware is in, I will reach a point where the people making software on the faster, newer machines will no longer be able to practically support older machines. Working in IT, I understand this.

I guess my question is this: what can be done about the monetary and material waste regarding objects which are not superficially, but actually *obsolete*, while still being physically functional? Some of them can be re-purposed for lesser functions, but innovation will always produce ""waste."" For instance, car produced 70 years ago that was made to last 75 years would still be perfectly adequate for the job. But if there were a sudden innovation in our transportation infrastructure (transition to alternate energy sources, for instance, or ""fly cars"" or something) we'd have a nation full of obsolete gas guzzlers. Like my computer, they'd still be fully *functional*, but essentially *purposeless*. Not the best analogy so please don't take it literally.

What are Anti-Con's thoughts on functional but obsolescent products? These are most obvious in digital consumer goods, can anyone think of other areas where this is the case?"	t5_2r83n	True

These people deriving a sense of identity from their attachment to a brand --""I am the type of person who does not buy company X's product, I buy company Y's product, and I feel very very strongly about it!"". These might also be the early adopters, who buy the next big thing as soon as it comes out. I always imagine that corporations must think these people are a dream, not only do they buy the things we make but they geniunely feel emotionally attached. 

The worst part though is that these same people think of 'mainstream' consumers as thoughtless and stupid. They consider themselves to be in a completely different category from the mainstream consumer. If anything, they have bought more into the consumption culture than anyone else.

Draco9793	66	11	35	"I just want to point out that it is perfectly okay to go to a mall and not buy anything. Malls are good for lots of things besides buying and can be repurposed in a way.

 My friends and I were really in the mood to get out of the house and spend some time together. If this was summer, we would have taken a long walk around the park and brought our lunches. Since this is December, outside for any length of time is not an option. So we tried to think of other ideas. 

Our group today consisted of four adults and a toddler. We wanted some place indoors with a lot of walking space. Someone mentioned the mall and at first we all cringed because none of us are traditional consumers. Then we actually thought about it. If you can get past the idea that you have to buy things at a mall, then the mall really has a lot to offer.

When we got to the mall it was completely decked out for Christmas. My daughter really enjoyed looking at all the decorations. There were countless Christmas trees and even a Santa's village with reindeer! In addition to the Christmas decorations, there were the typical mall asthetics like fountains and art on the walls. My daughter sat in her stroller as we walked and stared at everything with wide eyes.

 When we got hungry we headed over to the food court - and unpacked our lunches we had brought from home. There were so many people doing different things that no one paid us any mind. Besides, tables in a food court are more like community space and it's not as taboo as walking into a restaurant with your own food.

We went into quite a few of the stores and found ways to enjoy their contents without bringing anything home. My favorite was a store with little statues and figurines of various types. I thought of how nice it was to go through and look at them all, but not have to take care of them (finding a space, dusting, etc). Other favorites included coffee shops and a chocolate store. The aromas were amazing. I learned to appreciate the smells as a thing in and of themselves, without them leading up to buying and eating something.

Our last good find was a free play area for kids. My daughter squealed and crawled around for quite awhile while the adults rested. There were even other kids there for her to play with.

Just to summarize, the mall has all of the following: plenty of space to walk around with the stroller, entertainment, a place to sit down and eat, and lots to look at. Let's not forget the opportunity for people-watching! Then add in the idea that all of this is inside a heated building that is open for most of the day with restrooms. We were there for 5 or 6 hours and I didn't buy a single thing!

Tl;Dr - if we get over the idea that we have to buy things at the mall and look at it in a completely different way, it can be a great place to go when it's too cold to go outside."	t5_2r83n	True

I usually buy or make homemade gifts, but it's always felt like an obligation, not something I've done out of love and free choice. I usually wait until the last minute then just throw something together that isn't heartfelt. I don't even remember all the gifts I gave last year.

I just hate the whole gift giving process. Thinking of a gift idea twice a year per person, going shopping, spending money. Even the receiving end - accumulating clutter and feeling obligated to use and keep the gifts I get. Homemade gifts aren't any better. It's still just creating something under pressure, and honestly, having to think of creative and unique little crafts, experiences or favors gets hard to do over and over. 

All my siblings are adults, we all make decent money and can treat ourselves when we want. We spend plenty of quality time together at Christmas and that's the only thing I want during the holidays. So how do I opt out? And not just Christmas, but birthdays too? 

Last year, I actually attempted to. I was met with a bit of hostility - *""So are you saying you don't like the gifts I've given you?""*"	t5_2r83n	True

My boyfriend lived in a tiny furnished subletted apartment, why he didn´t own any furniture or anything. When he finally got an offer for a bigger place we had to find him all of the furniture needed. Expensive story we thought, which the financial situation didn´t really allow. 
Instead of buying things, we started to walk around in my area to look for abandoned furniture in dumpsters. Doing this for a while regulary, we found everything you could ever wish for, kitchen table, desks, coffetable, balcony furniture, rugs, lamps, tv, everything. (I found some really nice things as well :) ) He bought a new bed, and a second hand sofa, otherwise everything we took was abandoned. 
The funnny thing is that the furniture are really nice, not worn at all, and people throw them away! On top of this he got an apartment furnished with original and unusual furniture!

What if it, like, falls apart at the seams, or the zipper breaks after that?  (I like to try and see how well the sales people view the product I'm thinking of buying).  

She tells me this (and I'm paraphrasing but **not** exaggerating):  

After 60 days though, nothing can be done.  But I mean you've got your money out of it by then.  

60 days?  This person thinks it's normal for a wallet ($45) to last for *60 days?*

* [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) - allows you to block all hte background javascript, in particular things like google analytics (running on the page I am on as I type this), facebook connect, twitter button and a few thousand others.

* [Better privacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/) - this is for firefox, but I assume there is a version for chromium based browsers. It deletes long-term storage cookies, which would not be deleted if you just clear all cookies from the browser, since it saves them to the flash file. More info [here](http://www.ghacks.net/2008/07/30/delete-flash-cookies/).

* Any cookie deletion tool - can be done via tools or something, but if I just have a button on my browser I remember more often.

THISISMYLASTRETORT	59	18	27	"but I urge you to consider capitalism's inherent drive for money as the root cause of consumerism. It's been said here that habits had to be restructured, new ways of thinking had to be erected so the gears of industry could keep on turning, and to what purpose does planned obsolesce work for? Money, but it's worse than just self-promotion, it's how the whole society works.

Like a plant is reliant on sunlight and carbon dioxide to photosynthesize, individual businesses are reliant on profit and growth to stay in existence. If they don't pursue profit in increasing amounts the competition uses the techniques and advantages that they won't. Bemoaning greed in capitalism is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how the system works. It can't do anything **other** than make money. So it butts up against the boundaries of reason, overproduction, blatant disregard for the environment and anything that's not its bottom line, hucksterism, stingy with rights in the era of the internet, and even having the gall of entering into the conversation about how we should live our lives.

*Commodification to capitalism is like photosynthesis to a plant. It can't be bemoaned or criticized, it can only be analyzed for how it operates.*  Nothing really demonstrated this to me so well as [this text](http://www.mediafire.com/view/?84ixasogsxcvxhr) I read in college, a selection from The Study of Global Problems and the Culture of Capitalism by Richard Robbins. I uploaded it in the hopes that you might like it and consider it.

2nd edit: I think I came at this from the wrong angle, I want to try again.




There's a way that we resign ourselves to living in a world not of our making. In a land that's a democracy, **that** is what's anti-democratic. The story that we tell ourselves that if you work hard to get impressive gear you'll have a good life is one story that tells us yes we can achieve, but only this narrow range of achievements. You can't fight toothpaste companies to remove the chemicals from their product this way. You can't abolish student debt this way. Believing this story is one way we keep ourselves from living in a world of our creation. 

So I'm encouraging you to examine **all** of the ways that you are being kept down, or rather how you keep yourself down. There's a whole field of study of it in the humanities called Critical Theory. 

I'm of the belief that capitalism needs this paralysis, and society creates this paralysis. We all know that capitalism sucks, the concept of money as a universal measure of value is dubious, but we all do it anyway. You want to look at what kind of messages are being spread? Who spreads them? Over what networks? All commercial networks, with their own interests in selling shit and not an ounce in anything else. The world is driven by money first. Everything else seems incidental.

1373939947.0	1idteq	Anticonsumption and the importance of outlook	surger1	50	9	10	"Consumption is the result of the systemic destruction of our sense of community. Western economics is founded on the idea of destroying community for the purpose of economic growth. Framed from the other angle we call it advertising.

Advertising since the early 1920's has diverged from solving peoples problems to creating problems to be solved by peoples purchases. Which is a fundamental shift in power. If you are purchasing a product not to solve a problem you have, but a problem you believe you have. And that this problem is implanted in you by those very same companies you are purchasing from than there is something very sinister going on indeed.

However that state of existence expired decades ago. We are now experiencing the issue of a population that is dependent on corporations to solve their problems. You see it everywhere, /r/Gaming is amazing for seeing how gamers are at the mercy of game corporations for their entertainment. Countless thousands of gaming redditors pouring thousands of hours into hoping and wishing about other peoples property. HL3! Pokemon MMO! Put this in the next COD. That is a consumer base who is so enslaved to their masters that they don't even recognize it. They would all spend a million years waiting for a pokemon mmo rather than banding together and making their own.

It's an example of how dis empowered people have become. If we want some sort of experience we would rather beg and whine for it then do it ourselves. Of course this came about due to patent and copyright laws. Which are now used to control the system. Where success is best determined not by what you do but who you are partnered with. Can't have a tech company not partnered with Microsoft because then you would never be able to afford all the operating systems. Can't have a sports team not partnered with XYZ. Suddenly the patents and copyrights are not defenses but economic weapons. Giving those with money the most sway because no one can possibly go against you with your mighty patents and copyrights.

This is of course going further than technology. Chain stores are economic vacuums. That drain resources from one area and bloat to a few actors in the system. Take Tim Hortons in Canada. There is essentially 1 Tim Hortons for every 5000 canadians, it's insanity. Every single one of those Tim Hortons employs people for minimum or as close to minimum as possible. Every Tim Horton is owned by a Franchise owner who purchased it not because they want a Coffee shop but because they want a Tim Hortons. These are then corporate husks of soul crushing misery for the workers. We laugh at it but I don't know how many people I have seen break down in tears because the job is destroying their life but it's only making coffee so no one listens to their problems. Their problem is they are stuck in a position where in order to meet their basic needs they have to degrade themselves and perform a job where you are treated with such condescension that your bathroom breaks are often timed .

Consumption has become a fact in western society. I understand why this group is Anti-consumption but to be Anti-consumption is to be anti society right now. I Firmly believe that we are never going to get past consumerism by fighting it. We have to get past it by ignoring it. We are entering an era where many tactics previously used to control the free markets are going to be having new problems. 3D printing is one, the decoupling of human labour from productivity, piracy, increased education, increased connectivity. 

All of these things pose issues to consumption. We cannot fight them with the rules they have now. It's impossible, however this is life and there are no rules. There is only nature which humanity is part of. So if we want to move away from consumerism then lets stop empowering the corporations by acting like their authority is valid. 

Advertising works at the moment because we have no community. People are not connected and do not feel invested in their neighbours, friends and families. This is true as we can see great reluctance in people to reach out for both help and offering aid. Strangers have been demonized and the general attitude of society seems to be better safe than sorry. Now the internet poses a new tool for us that we simply have not capitalized on. Sites like reddit are beginning to show how this can be done with things  like /r/randomactsofpizza. Where for no real reason people are doing things for each other.

The big issue is currently there is a conflict that much of the community talent is being used to create corporate capital and the communities do not benefit. These people are trying to capitalize on the sense of community and this causes it to be counter intuitive as capital is the anti-thesis of community. Capital promotes the idea that you are removed from your responsibility to your community through capital. You pay X amount so you are thereby freed from certain social obligations. Community is the idea that you ensure your neighbor has enough to eat before sitting down to your own meal. Capitalism simply does not work as well when people support each other. The less support the more they require your goods and services.

So let's focus on anti-capitalism through the reconstruction of our sense of community and empowerment. Maybe today we could start a project that would begin to bring the power back to the people. We do not have a consumption problem, that's a symptom. We consume because it's one of the only ways in which we may express control on our environment. Buying something is easy, everything that is free is boring or bureaucratic. We have a empowerment problem, the only way people in our society can have power is through money. However the one thing we have that is free is each other. Because what you and I decide to do of our own accord is our business. If we can reconnect people then we can start to end this outrageous consumption.

The stage is being primed for it too. High unemployment, increasing education. We have a number of very educated people doing very little. Why should we be confined to these societal rules when there is enough of us to live around them. We could begin creating a support network for individuals who want to live outside the system, begin setting up libraries of consumer goods. Start connecting communities around local grass roots projects. Allow people to take back their lives by helping their neighbors take back theirs. No more fighting the system, let's grow the new system in the old one and watch as the other one dies its natural death.

This all might be bullshit, maybe we can't make a change this way but I'm tired of my dress pants and shirts. I'm tired of having jeans and a t-shirt dangled in front of me every Friday as if it's a huge favor to allow me to dress comfortably. I'm fed up with my national identity being hijacked by corporations who's head offices are not even located in that country. I had a nice little plan for my life and I'm done with it. I cannot abide the travesties people commit on each other because they are so unempowered that they are forced to degrade themselves in 3 minimum wage jobs just to keep up with all of the social pressures society has created to keep the economic machine churning. So I'm out there, one nut who will be spending the rest of my days building a future in which people do not have to destroy their lives just to live."	t5_2r83n	True

Frankly, I don't think much of guys who just live life for pickups. Here, the area of game I'm referring to is creating successful and fulfilling relationships (and not going broke) by not constantly trying to please potential partners by buying them pointless stuff. A better synonym here would be ""social dynamics/interactions."" I think hoping to win a woman's heart with shiny expensive crap is actually degrading to them; the ones you do catch will never be fully interested in you anyway.

I never felt good about giving women I wasn't already in a relationship with gifts to try and woo them; it always sort of felt like a beta niceguy thing to do and rarely had any effect. Once I stopped being so eager to pay for expensive dates and trying to impress women with a fancy image, and learned some game, my experience with women improved dramatically. Suddenly ""dating"" became a much more enjoyable thing to do since there wasn't such a high material or financial cost associated with it (I almost always split the bill); I was going on more of them, and more went somewhere. 

Then I realized how much of all male (especially &lt;30 years) consumption is directly tied to attempts (usually fruitless) to attract women; think cars, clothes, watches, gadgets, and paying for expensive dinners and shiny gifts. Most young guys want to be millionaires for women!

Many guys whine about how dating is so expensive and how women expect so much, but I think they're just trapped in another loop of the consumption cycle. Learning basic game improved my love life, saved a ton of money, and helped the planet. What do you think?"	t5_2r83n	True

1278429100.0	cmi28	Seduced by the Image of Reality		46	9	19	" When I would look through magazines as a small child, I used to think that there must be a magical world somewhere where everything looked—and was—perfect. I could see pictures from it in those pages, the smoky air of dimly-lit rooms heavy with drama as the young models lounged in designer fashions. That is where excitement and adventure is to be found, I thought, in the world where every room is flawlessly decorated and every woman's wardrobe is picked and matched with daring and finesse. I resolved to have an adventurous life of my own, and began looking for those rooms and women right away. And though I've discovered since then that romance and excitement rarely come hand in hand with the images of them that are presented to us—usually the opposite is true, that adventure is to be found precisely where there is no time or energy for keeping up appearances—I still catch myself sometimes thinking that everything would be perfect if only I lived in that picturesque log cabin with matching rugs.

Whatever each us may be looking for, we all tend to pursue our desires by pursuing images: symbols of the things we desire. We buy leather jackets when we want rebellion and danger. We purchase fast cars not for the sake of driving fast, but to recapture our lost youth. When we want world revolution, we buy political pamphlets and bumper stickers. Somehow we assume that having all the right accessories will get us the perfect lives. And when we construct our lives, we often do it according to an image, a pattern that has been laid out for us: hippie, businessman, housewife, punk.

Why do we think so much about images today, rather than concentrating on reality, on our lives and emotions themselves? One of the reasons images have attained so much significance in this society is that, unlike activities, images are easy to sell. Advertising and marketing, which are designed to invest products with a symbolic value that will attract consumers, have transformed our culture. Corporations have been spreading propaganda designed to make us believe in the magic powers of their commodities for generations now: deodorant offers popularity, soda offers youth and energy, jeans offer sex appeal. At our jobs, we exchange our time, energy, and creativity for the ability to buy these symbols—and we keep buying them, for of course no quantity of cigarettes can really give anyone sophistication. Rather than satisfying our needs, these products multiply them: for in order to get them, we end up selling parts of our lives away. We keep going back, not knowing any other way, hoping that the new product (self-help books, punk rock records, that vacation cabin with matching rugs) will be the one that will fix everything.

We are easily persuaded to chase these images because it is simply easier to change the scenery around you than it is to change your own life. How much less trouble, how much less risky it would be if you could make your life perfect just by collecting all the right accessories! No participation necessary. The image comes to embody all the things you desire, and you spend all your time and energy trying to get the details right (the bohemian tries to find the perfect black beret and the right poetry readings to attend—the frat boy has to be seen with the right friends, at the right parties, drinking the right beers and wearing the right informal dress shirts) rather than pursuing the desires themselves—for of course it's easier to identify yourself with a prefabricated image than to identify exactly what you want in life. But if you really want adventure, an Australian hunting jacket won't suffice, and if you want real romance, dinner and a movie with the most popular girl at your school might not be enough.

Fascinated as we are by images, our values have come to revolve around a world we can never actually experience. There's no way into the pages of the magazine, there's no way to be the archetypal punk or the perfect executive. We're ""trapped"" out here in the real world, forever. And yet we keep looking for life in pictures, in fashions, in spectacles of all kinds, anything that we can collect or watch—instead of doing.

WE LOOK FOR LIFE IN THE IMAGE OF LIFE.


Watching from the Sidelines
The curious thing about a spectacle is how it immobilizes the spectators: just like the image, it centers their attention, their values, and ultimately their lives around something outside of themselves. It keeps them occupied without making them active, it keeps them feeling involved without giving them control. You can probably think of a thousand different examples of this: television programs, action movies, magazines that give updates on the lives of celebrities and superstars, spectator sports, representative ""democracy,"" the Catholic church.

A spectacle also isolates the people whose attention it commands. Many of us know more about the fictitious characters of popular sitcoms than we know about the lives and loves of our neighbors—for even when we talk to them, it is about television shows, the news, and the weather; thus the very experiences and information that we share in common as spectators of the mass-media serve to separate us from one another. It is the same at a big football game: everybody watching from the bleachers is a nobody, regardless of who they are. They may be sitting next to each other, but all eyes are focused on the field. If they speak to each other, it is almost never about each other, but about the game that is being played before them. And although football fans cannot participate in the events of the game they are watching, or exert any real influence over them, they attach the utmost importance to these events and associate their own needs and desires with their outcome in a most unusual way. Rather than concentrating their attention on things that have a real bearing on their desires, they reconstruct their desires to revolve around the things they pay attention to. Their language even conflates the achievements of the team they identify themselves with with their own actions: ""we scored a goal!"" ""we won!"" shout the fans from their seats and sofas.

This stands in stark contrast to the way people speak about the things that go on in our own cities and communities. ""They're building a new highway,"" we say about the new changes in our neighborhood. ""What will they think of next?"" we say about the latest advances in scientific technology. Our language reveals that we think of ourselves as spectators in our own societies. But it's not ""They,"" the mysterious Other People, who have made the world the way it is—it is we, humanity ourselves. No small team of scientists, city planners, and rich bureaucrats could have done all the working and inventing and organizing that it has taken for us to transform this planet; it has taken and still takes all of us, working together, to do this. We are the ones doing it, every day. And yet most of us seem to feel that we can have more control over football games than we can over our cities, our jobs, even our own lives.

We might have more success in our pursuit of happiness if we start trying to really participate. Rather than trying to fit images, we can seek exciting and rewarding experiences; for happiness does not come from what you have or how your appear, but from what you do and how you feel. And instead of accepting the role of passive spectator to sports, society, and life, it is up to each of us to figure out how to play an active and significant part in creating the worlds around us and within us. Perhaps one day we can build a new society in which we can all be involved together in the decisions that affect the lives we lead; then we will be able to truly choose our own destinies, instead of feeling helpless and left out.

What's the point of doing anything
if nobody's watching?

We all want to be famous, to be seen, frozen, preserved in the media, because we've come to trust what is seen more than what is actually lived. Somehow we've gotten everything backwards and images seem more real to us than experiences. To know that we really exist, that we really matter, we have to see ghosts of ourselves preserved in photographs, on television shows and videotapes, in the public eye.

And when you go on vacation, what do you see? Scores of tourists with video cameras screwed to their faces, as if they're trying to suck all of the real world into the two-dimensional world of images, spending their ""time off"" seeing the world through a tiny glass lens. Sure, turning everything that you could experience with all five senses into recorded information that you can only observe from a distance, detached, offers us the illusion of having control over our lives: we can rewind and replay them, over and over, until everything looks ridiculous. But what kind of life is that?

* At its very best it can be an educational and informing tool (in a  utopian society that does not exist) but even then it is still crude ,unengaging, passive and only moves at one pace.

* At it's worst it could be used to manipulate people into doing practically anything and with the CGI only improving its capabilities in this area grow.


* Currently for every mind it has helped to expand it has expanded the waistline of many more.
It trivializes horrific disasters  turning them into circus shows and our ordinary day to day existence into unnecessary drama ,while convincing people this pointless time-sink is a worthwhile activity, and the likes of 'reality' shows like big brother and the X-factor telling people reality can be decided by a phone in vote(that may or may not be counted).In a sense it invented the ""slacktivism"" that many claim plagues the online world today.

* IMO it's negative effects far outweigh its positive influences especially considering the availability of other media through which those same positive influences can propagate more efficiently.Something manufacturers of television have themselves realized as they attempt to save the television with 3d vision, apps and built in web-browsers, while cable companies provide stunted slow broadband services attempt to stop the revenue hemorrhage  from the loss of viewers due to competition from online services both legal and illegal.

Now that pets and kids are in our lives, what mental journeys do you go on or have you been on? Have you anti-consumed through the years, to be able to give pointers on handling grandparents at the holidays or activities out in the world as the kids age, etc?

We are pretty home/homestead centered.  Our toddlers already cook with us, we're putting in gardens in the front yard together, we don't watch cable or buy really anything outside of the VERY occasional trip to the used bookstore.  For my kid's 3rd birthday we built her a climbing wall on the side of our house instead of buying her anything. So we generally get it, mostly.  We're much more into the ""do"" than the ""have"".

Researching anti-consumption or even Early Retirees, I find far more childless examples, or people that went into early retirement having planned for the one kid (a la Mr. Money Mustache).  While I'm not looking specifically to retire early, I find that the reasons for both overlap a lot for me, but we didn't get to the anti-consumption/ere philosophy until just a year or so ago.

So for those of you on this path WITH kids or pets or both, what are your thoughts on the rewards/challenges of this lifestyle? Any tips or advice you wish you'd been given earlier?"	t5_2r83n	True

We are already what I would consider frugal and mindful of not buying unneeded items. Pre-children we didn't even fuss with Christmas for a few years and I personally found it liberating. We now have kids and have allowed ourselves to do the Santa bit. I tried to keep it reasonable and only bought items I knew they would really value and use. So in the end I think I did ok. Lot's of books for my 6 year old and the likes. 

I'm curious to hear from those of you who are parents and have adopted anitconsumption as your way, how do you navigate this with your kids. I just recently bought (I know consumption) something called moonjar which so far I really like. It's a program to teach kids about money. We haven't finished reading the material yet, but I think this is a great start. I told my 6 year old that I would no longer buy things for her ""just because"", but she will still have her needs met. I'm trying to set her up to learn how to create income producing opportunities for herself. 

Thanks in advance for feedback and please be kind Reddit, I am still learning. ;-)

You a studying for a standardized test that will determine whether you get into the Great American Hall of Job Security that you want by seeing how well you know to read a chart and preform trigonometry. Why are you taking such a test? Because the Great American Halls of Job Security want you to, and the test company knows you will pay for it. You feel like there is something wrong with this, but what else can you do? The script you've been given doesn't have anything else in mind.

You are prepping for prom. You asked out the person you Love (with a capital L) by buying a box of chocolates. You prepared by buying a suit or a dress, (which you know you will never wear again) and your partner prepared by doing the same. You bought flowers for the night of, because 1-800-FLOWERS is how you show that you care, that you really do Love him or her. At prom, you sit around and eat food which isn't your favorite talking to people with whom you didn't really get to choose to interact with, but it doesn't matter because you are with the person you Love and you are too drunk on hormones (or actual alcohol, or both) to care. You feel like there is something better than this, something far less trite and something far more beautiful and human, but what else can you do? The script you've been given doesn’t have anything else in mind.

You are sitting in your room. You have so much in it, but the only way you think about it is how you are going to upgrade those things next - to Improve Your Life. Do you go to Ikea, and upgrade the bed? Or is it the phone sitting on your nightstand that needs improving to satiate your existential ennui - perhaps the latest offerings from Samsung or Apple will provide your fix? Does your laptop need to be replaced with the latest MacBook Pro, or Thinkpad? Does that laptop’s lack of a Netflix subscription or sizable Steam library bug you? These questions rack your head, but you don’t exactly why you are not content with the items you already have. But what else can you do? The script you’ve been given doesn’t have anything else in mind. 

Study (C). Love (TM). Buy (CC). 

This is the script that has been regurgitated to us by our peers, and written by those who would benefit. Benefit from the tests, the prep books, the suits, the flowers, the iPhones, the beds, the games, the movies and the clothes. 

This is the script by which, I fear, I have been living my life. And what do I have to show for it? A list of neuroses a mile long, and no real happiness to show for it.

My friends, I don’t want to live like this any longer. I don’t want to live the life that has been set up for me by those who seek to mash together my young humanity with the consumerist machine. I want to embrace the experiences that I truly want to experience, the experiences that only my youth and my wealth can bring me before it’s too late. 

I want to really live, my friends. And I hope you do, too. There is a stunningly beautiful world out there, and it’s nothing like the one you saw on the screen."	t5_2r83n	True

The problem lies in that instead of building my worth through objects, I have moved to giving power to the worth of 'intelligence' and knowledge (ideas, art, etc).

It starts out with a woman asking a doctor if she can hold her baby, and he replies with, (paraphrase) ""You can have it in two months."" The narrator tells the audience that they wouldn't put up with that, so why should they put up with having to buy clothes at the end of the season (2 months) in order to get them for cheap.

I've heard some stupid, degrading commercials in my life, but this one just floored me. The message is ""Clothes are just as (if not more!) important as bonding with your newborn baby."" We've heard these messages over and over again our whole lives. It's ingrained into our psyches.

Seems to me developing an inferior product for a lower market level's pretty antithetical to even the essential ideas of idealized capitalism: the idea that the free market leads to better stuff and happier consumers doesn't hold water if one key principle is the deliberate manufacture of inferior products for different market segments.

This is an AMA because I will require some prompting to explain what I do for many things I am about to describe and many things I won't.

The stuff most people buy but we don't: shampoo, conditioner, hair-styling products, toothpaste, deodorant, lotion, sunscreen, toilet paper, glass cleaner, kitchen cleaner, all of those fucking cleaners, we don't buy them, paper towels, new clothes... Fuck! There's too much to list. SO...... Let's talk about things I've listed or things you buy on a regular schedule and would like an alternative to. I can give you a recipe, design, or formula for most of those things. 

I thought when making this thread I could ACTUALLY make a list of all of the things I make or do for myself and my family, but the task is much too daunting and complicated.

One thing I wanted to mention before I leave this post to be picked apart by the crows, is that I provide my own security services. I know this isn't viable for everyone, but I carry a pistol everywhere I go for providing my own protection/security service. Like most of the things I DIY, providing my own protection against harm, danger, etc. has less of an overall cost to society than relying on government provided police service. Also, like most of my DIY projects, being prepared to protect the life and safety of myself and others is far superior to the products that are widely available. 

Anyways, if you have a good or service you would like to provide for yourself instead of buying it, let me know. I probably have a reasonable solution to replacing that need."	t5_2r83n	True

""Why do you want to have a baby with me? You can’t stand me.""

""That’s not true!""

.

Awkward silence — Meryl’s eyes light up with an idea as she turns around

(in a peppy, contrived voice)

""Why don’t you let me fix you some of this new Mococoa drink? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua, no artificial sweeteners!""

""What the hell are you talkin’ about?"" Looks around incredulously — “Who are you talkin’ to?"" Truman asks deliberately as his eyebrows shoot up and his irises dart left to right along with his head; Truman suppinates both of his palms  — almost begging that she present some person, some reason for her spontaneous incorporated plug

""I’ve tasted other cocoa’s; this is the best,"" Meryl says as she taps the lid, a pasted on smile stretched across her lips.

""— the hell does this have to do with anything,"" Truman enquires as he spreads out his arms, looking around the room — almost inspiring the question of the bigger picture. He advances toward her, and nearly yells the end of the sentence “Tell me what’s HAPPENING!""

""Well, you’re having a nervous breakdown, that’s what’s happening."" Meryl says this with fear in her eyes, a failure to understand what Truman seeks — an inability to give it to him or even comprehend its importance.


Truman’s eyes squint and his finger pointedly, accusatorily enforces his question “You’re part of this aren’t you?""

Meryl pulls out her consumer product threateningly. The “Chef’s Pal"", grater, dicer, peeler. “Truman.""

Truman gasps, “Meryl!""

""You. Are. Scaring me."" Meryl swings the tri-pronged Chef’s Pal from left to right, at the level of Truman’s neck.

Truman just shakes his head, “You’re scaring me Meryl.""

Truman jukes left, “Dice me! Slice me, or peel me. There are so many choices!"" Truman yells the last word as he grabs Meryl’s outstretched right arm and pulls her into him, like one would apprehend a hostage in front of a gunman. 

Truman struggles to pull the utensil from her hands, and as it jerks free Meryl yells, “Do something!"" Her eyes go fearfully vacant as she realizes what she’s said, what she has given away. The epiphany, for Truman, causes him to furrow his brow in disbelief — his mouth hangs slightly open, speechless. He looks beyond her, not at her. 

And, with the film paused, you’re surprised to realize that this crucial moment, this climax, is not being directly portrayed. You’ve been put into the position of another spectator. We subjectively watch someone else watching television. In other words, you’re not watching the moment, you’re watching another television depict the moment. Beyond merely being removed from the moment, you are subjected to the point of view of a spectator living in the world in which The Truman Show exists as a form of entertainment — a mixture of advertising, life, and supposed genuineness.

My family came from the Soviet Union, and naturally were hoarders. (it used to be pretty hard to buy something simple like soap there.)

I used to really like toys and things in general when I was little. As I grew older, things started to appeal less and less to me.

Nowadays on my birthday people have a pretty hard time coming up with something for me, because I usually don't want any 'thing'. Sure, we can simply go to a restaurant to celebrate, but it's not really different from going to a restaurant on a normal day.

With regards to going out, at my work, people buy food from expensive places every day. Cooking 'takes too much time'.

I also have a hard time getting people gifts. Making something for someone is considered cheap. And someone being minimal wouldn't want to keep around that thing anyway.

Thinking further in the future, these days it's hard to find a nonmaterialist spouse. It is assumed by current culture norms that the wedding and ring will be this grand very expensive venture. I might get a lot of haters for this one but: To a small extent the girl would decide whether or not to marry based on the price of the ring. Do you really want to represent a whole marrage relationship with a ring?

My parents don't wear their rings - they love eachother and don't need a reminder of it. In their days, weddings were not so expensive, there were no honey moons. Giving an expensive wedding gift was thought off as show off wealth, so people didn't do it much.

But now everything seems to be different. It's horrible, but it's the world we live in. Going around it would be considered social suicide.

I love our technological process. Every year some new amazing things keep appearing. 3d printing, nanotechnology, wikipedia.. You name it.

But it seems, socially things are getting worse every time.

Please let me know if I am looking at this the wrong way or dead wrong.. Maybe hanging out with the wrong crowd? I don't know."	t5_2r83n	True

I recently got a new apartment and have enjoyed filling it up with furniture and toys. I have the essentials, but the place is still bare from decorations/bringing life to the room. I have student loans, which I am paying off with a large percentage of my paychecks. My question is if it is not smart to keep buying all these things for my apartment instead of dumping money into ""feeling good"". The more I think about it, I get the sense that being relaxed in my home is a false sense of comfort. Obviously getting rid of my loans ASAP is ideal, but paying it off piece by piece is acceptable too. Or do I just have a poor understanding of how loan/credit works? I pay all my bills on time, use credit to build  it up over time to eventually buy a house, and am putting some in savings. Is it so wrong to buy extra stuff on the side?

I feared this sub would be redundant considering there was already r/frugal, r/selfsufficiency, ect. but luckily people flocked to this community because apart from the solutions the other subs offer this place has served as an ideological outlet for it's members. 

I assume this post will garner it's fair share of downvotes but I've felt the need to express my appreciation for this community and it's various contributors such as maxcactus, vicinsea, paulwheaton, jms and the rest. 

This community has made me realize that I'm not alone in not being able to understand the orgy that is modern consumerism. At the moment this sub has 2200 members, perhaps by 2012 we could have 4000+.

One has very little control over the important things, and the quest for consumer goods can be seen as a sort of pacifier, in that the way that a baby's pacifier allows her to engage the motions of suckling without deriving any real nutrition. A white-collar cubicle slave is unlikely to escape from employment to freedom, but she can go shopping, and in the act of buy or not buying, have the momentary sensation of agency.

Might this be an explanation for the phenomenon of compulsive shopping: Where people run up massive debts buying things that they don't need, and ultimately do not even really care that they own, since they don't satisfy, and more in needed. 

This then serves to bind them more closely to their servitude, since their debts leave them little breathing room.

I've been thinking about bartering the soap and cheese for a while.  This weekend I got a ton of cream on sale and now have a lot of soft cheeses, I'd like to arrange a barter with someone who mills her own flour.  Those of you who barter, how do you determine what fair value is? Do you base it on grocery store prices or have another method?	t5_2r83n	True
1311823574.0	j1tie	Dear r/Anticonsumption, I want to understand your views better...	thebaysix	28	8	64	"I randomly stumbled upon this subreddit and it has really got me thinking, but probably not in the way you'd expect. For some background, I identify with many libertarian views, which are typically thought to be completely incompatible with ideas like those in this subreddit (I support freedom of the large corporation as much as I do the freedom of the individual and anticonsumption is closely tied to distaste for large corporations). Before I go any further, I want to say that I am making this post only for friendly discussion and I am not trying to be inflammatory in any way.

I got to thinking, and I have come to the conclusion that many of the ideas here have significant merit. I agree that there is value in avoiding unnecessary consumption; I agree that it is common for people to place undue value on the acceptance of others; and I agree that conformity is a sad thing that is often settled for. 

However, from what I can tell, I do not value these things for the same reasons that subscribers of r/Anticonsumption do. I value avoiding unnecessary consumption because I value money and smart handling of money; I value independence from the acceptance of others because I value individuality and freedom to be yourself; and I think rejection of conformity is admirable because that rejection is the enaction of one's own freedom.

So that's where I'm coming from. This is where I get confused though. It says in the side bar:

&gt;A sub reddit for people that think that conspicuous consumption is ruining the planet and ruining people's lives.

It is a HUGE jump from ""I value freedom and independence"" to ""consumption is ruining people's lives""

I certainly think that there is a tendency for people to be inundated into making unwise decisions, but I do not think that this ruins people's lives. That is a big gap for me, and I want to hear responses from people who subscribe to the view espoused in the sidebar. My questions for those people are: What, in your opinion, is the exact problem with consumption? What does ""conspicuous consumption"" mean to you? How big of a problem do you think (conspicuous) consumption is? How would you go about remedying it? Do you think people can figure this out for themselves or do you think some ""intervention"" is needed?

I realize these are broad questions, but I am just trying to gain insight into the ideas behind Anti-consumerism. Anything you think will help me understand is welcome, it doesn't necessarily have to answer one of the questions above. I might not be asking the right questions, after all! ;)

Thanks.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the thoughtful responses so far, keep them coming! I'll ask some follow up questions when I get the chance.

**Edit 2:** I'm taking a break from reddit for a while, I have done a lot of typing (In the morning, during my lunch break, when I got home...) and I am tired. I'm sorry if I didn't get to respond to your post, but I have read them all and you have all helped me a bunch. I'll be back soon and thanks to all for the discussion."	t5_2r83n	True

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Stuff"" 

Stuff. I used to have a lot of it: knickknacks on book shelves; a closet full of clothes of which I wore only 20 percent of, along with the accompanying plastic hangers; a DVD collection; and dishes, silverware, and pots and pans to accommodate a five person household (though, when I wasn’t living alone, I only had one roommate). Having this amount of stuff was normal by most standards. I was living the status-quo. Buying stuff felt good, if not just for that temporary moment. The new toy I had to have, new bedding, another IKEA bookshelf to hold the other stuff I had and would acquire in the future, or a recently released movie I had to own, which I had likely already seen and would watch at most once more. It just felt nice to have the collection on the chance that someone would want to watch it, whether that someone was me or a guest. But 80 percent of the movies never saw the inside of a DVD player again.

I cannot remember the exact time I noticed, or if there even was a singular moment, but at some point I couldn’t stand it anymore. Little things became annoying, such as how long it took to clean and organize my living space, or the amount of crap on bookshelves and bathroom countertops that seemed to collect a volcanic eruption worth of dust on them overnight. To an extent, I like things to have their place and be relatively clean. But unlike others that are more seriously affected with obsession-compulsion, there was a point where the time and effort involved in making sure all of those things were in their place was not worth the outcome. I suppose keeping on top of it would make it seem like less effort, but in reality, it’s just diffusing it.

But worrying and working to keep all the stuff organized and clean was not the only reason for the growing discomfort. There was another reason that was a psychologically deeper issue. One specific incident that I remember quite well, I look back on now as a reason for why I am the way I am today. I was about 23 years old and wanted to rearrange my room. This was going to be a significant undertaking considering the amount of stuff I had. It took the better part of a day, but once I was finished and had the room the way I wanted it, a kind of depression set in. This was not my room, or my home. It was not familiar. I liked the efficiency and aesthetics of the new layout better, but something didn’t sit right. This thing was over here and that stack of stuff was now over there. I didn’t recognize it. I didn’t really give much thought as to why I was feeling this way at the time – it could partially have been a fear of change to some extent, but either way it was just stuff changing location and I let it cascade into a giant snowball of anxiety over the next few days. Similar episodes were brought on by moving. Soon enough though, the anxiety of my changed surroundings began to fade and within a few days, things felt normal again. Though, it wouldn’t be until a few years later that I looked back on this time when I was contemplating my attachment to material things.

Why did I have all this stuff? We all need a certain amount of stuff. Food, shelter and clothing are really the only material things we need. I had all of those of course, but I had plenty more. There are two main reasons I held on to them: I may use them later, or they held some sort of sentimental significance. For me, the sentimental value category can be further broken down into two additional subcategories: gifts, photos or handmade pieces from people close to the heart; or items that represent a moment or experience. The former are clearly sentimental. The latter were less so, but still enough to make parting with them difficult. I look back now, and although I understand why it was difficult, I still laugh at myself for having a hard time letting go of that shelf full of Ichiro or Edgar Martinez bobble-head dolls I collected as one of the first 15,000 fans to enter a Mariner’s game.

Sometime during my years at university, my desire to have less stuff became a conscious thought. This though, was only the beginning of a process that would take years to fully realize. It consisted of a recursive analysis of everything I owned, asking myself if I really needed them. The process itself wasn’t conscious, but a new round of purging would happen when I still wasn’t happy with the amount of stuff I had left over from the last time I downsized. Only now from this point in time can I look back and see that it was indeed a long process of not only getting rid of things, but becoming less attached to material possessions. Each iteration would prove to be a tougher test as I peeled away layer after layer of things that increasingly had more sentimental value attributed to them. Several passes couldn’t get rid of those bobble-head dolls or movies I never watched. But after a while, they eventually went. For the bobble-head dolls, and other souvenirs that represented fond memories, it was a matter of asking whether or not these things really complimented the actual memories. My answer was always no. In the end, they were just things. The memories of the experiences are the best souvenirs I could ask for. One day in old age I may not have those memories, but at that point, there is little a material item will do for it. I understand there is value in using some things to facilitate memory in Alzheimer’s patients, but for me it is not worth the time or money involved lugging them around or having ever increasing housing or storage space to accommodate them. The other thing persuading me to let them go was to realize that this is exactly what industries love – collectors. They want me to buy that matching pint glass, collect all of the McDonald’s monopoly pieces, or complete my set of limited edition baseball memorabilia. Companies fully understand the desire to collect, which is why studios make a killing on putting out a new box set each year, be it a movie trilogy or a re-mastered album series. This is also why companies like Hard Rock Cafe can get away charging $35 for t-shirt with the same looking design on it, but a different city name.

For me, photos, videos and music are the center of the sentimental onion. Fortunately, the information age has made the task of organizing, consolidating and storing these much easier. No more boxes full of pictures or photo sleeves full of 35mm negatives. No more bookshelves or CD binders packed with easily-damaged video or audio media. Now digitally consolidated, they take up no more space than a small portable hard drive. One day, these may all go into online storage and take up an even smaller footprint.

Before traveling, I sold a lot of what I owned and kept a small amount of things that I would need for when I got back. As of now, I have whittled my life down to the following: a car, a mountain bike, a small amount of clothes and shoes which all get equal attention, a laptop, a kindle, one LCD TV, and a few totes of stuff that have stuff that I either need to go through or I will eventually need for my next place (silverware, plates, bowls, camping gear, etc…). There will inevitably be a time when I return, or settle somewhere for a while that I will need to purchase some things to make a new flat livable, but it will be done with a new mindset – one that realizes all that all I really need are a roof over my head, clothes on my back and few other things. Living out of a 48L backpack for the past 10 months has really made evident what I do, and do not need.

In the end, stuff stressed me out. I don’t like the feeling of it all chained to my ankle. It’s very cliché, and possibly overused, but the famous Fight Club quote still heavily resonates with me: “the things you own, end up owning you.” The stuff I had dictated a lot of my life. I had a lot of stuff, so I needed larger and larger accommodations or storage to contain and maintain it. Larger accommodations and more maintenance meant more recurring expenses. More recurring expenses meant less money available for things I actually enjoyed and also the dreadful feeling of being bound to a particular career or line of work because it paid well, regardless of my dislike and unhappiness in it.

Now, I feel more freedom than I have felt in a long time. The moment it hit me that I had overcome my attachment to stuff was when I asked my folks to not buy anything for me for Christmas. If I need it, I will buy it. If they still felt like doing something for me, I happily accepted gift cards or cash. It was understandably a little uncomfortable for them to have me sit there and watch the rest of the family open gifts while I had nothing. Though, I was perfectly happy. I am perfectly content just spending holiday time in the company of close friends and family. Not having to sort through a box of gifts, wondering where I was going to put everything, was a relief. It was even better knowing that what I did receive – gift cards and cash – I could use for practical purposes or put towards a vacation (or in this particular case, funding a year long, sell-everything, pack-up and get-out-of-dodge Euro-trip). They took up no more room than a couple spots in my wallet – of which I had previously cleansed of old business cards and receipts to make room.

I also worked hard to eliminate debt, which is another thing I despise and is highly correlated with stuff consumption. By doing all of this and acclimating to a life of modest accommodations over the past 10 months of traveling, I have set myself up to do more of the things I enjoy, and less that I don’t. I no longer have a huge ball-and-chain dictating my life. I now have the ability to choose any line of work that I am happy doing, regardless of how lucrative it is or isn’t. It now seems that that world of possibilities that people talk about does actually exist.

I made some truly wonderful friends while traveling – specifically in Eastern Europe – where this kind of problem would be laughed at. It’s also overused and cliché, but this definitely falls in the category of first world problems. On one hand I am lucky to have been raised in a place of such opportunity, but on the other, I now see how a culture of fear and consumption has affected me.

As a disclaimer, I want to be absolutely clear about something: this is in no way a judgment levied against anyone else’s lifestyle choices. I feel like any time I start explaining my choices, someone gets defensive as if I am attacking their lifestyle. If you are truly happy living the way you are living, then that is what matters. My changes were for me and me only. If what I am saying strikes a chord with you, then take what you want and leave what you don’t. If that still isn’t clear enough, let me be blunter: I do not give one single fuck how you choose to live your life as long as you are not taking that ability away from someone else. This statement applies not only to this particular aspect of life, but in all, and will likely be referred to in future entries."	t5_2r83n	True

It all started in February 2012 when we were in our second year of uni. Me and a couple of friends went to the first edition of Startup Weekend Cluj, totally oblivious regarding the whole event. There was a guy there who pitched the idea of “eBay for sharing”, arguing that in 80% of the time we use 20% of our possessions; so why buy things when you can borrow, swap, receive? We liked the idea a lot and since we were some of the very few developers available, we decided to help him build a prototype that we ended up calling [**UseTogether**](http://www.usetogether.com/).

Surprisingly enough, the project won first place so we found ourselves working late nights and weekends to turn [**UseTogether**](http://www.usetogether.com/) into something real.

Fast forward 15 months: we've lost a few people along the way, received a small investment, quit our jobs and we're still struggling to turn [**UseTogether**](http://www.usetogether.com/) into something big(er).

Now, the main problem we have is that (almost) everyone thinks this is a great idea:

&gt; Wow! It's like couchsurfing for your personal possessions! That's great! Yeah, sure, I get to save money, meet some new people.

But when it comes to actually using the platform, very few people find the time / energy to actually post things that they're willing to share. Our growth rate is really slow at the moment and I often find myself wondering whether or not it's worth the effort and whether or not it will ever take off.

I've uploaded some [**screenshots here**](http://imgur.com/a/hFd4Y) if you'd like to see the whole thing in action.

So, my question is: do you think a platform like this might be useful? Would you use it? And if not, why?

Any kind of feedback is hugely appreciated. Thank you.

1359386750.0	17fjpw	What is your flavor of anticonsumption?	MrWiggles2	21	3	23	"Do you just have an overall distaste for material goods, or just a few in particular?

Is it based on frugality or does the marketing tactics of some corporations just turn you off to their product entirely?

Do/Can you support *informed* consumerism such as doing the research to make sure you get the best product after having already decided you will purchase?

I only ask because this past weekend I've had some mixed feelings which made me really think about why I'm anticonsumption.

I recently got an apartment with a friend of mine whose father was a big tech geek.  In doing so, I ended up with a living room kitted out with a top of the line home theatre system.  I'm talking 55"" 3DHDTV, 7.1 surround sound, Blu-ray player and all the current gen gaming systems.

I'm not gonna lie, It's nice.  I really didn't know that home-viewing of movies could be so engaging, and this made me feel a bit guilty.

I'm not going to turn around tomorrow and set up my bedroom to be the same, nor am I looking into how to make it better (aside from research into computer parts to build an HTPC).  I still refuse to patronize the same companies whose marketing I disagree with.  I still do plenty of research into a product before making the decision on whether or not I will buy, and I still do most of my cooking from scratch, and I still don't watch TV.  I've lived the past 3 years without cable, relying on netflix or rentals for my video entertainment, and I still do - for the most part - even though we now have satellite with the middle-road channel package."	t5_2r83n	True

1321239079.0	mbd6g	One of my childhood experiences with advertising. Anyone else want to share theirs?	Draco9793	20	2	15	"When I was in Elementary School, I used to watch a lot of TV. Not only did 2-3 hours a day of TV help to make me a fat kid and a chubby teenager, but the constant advertising gave me a warped sense of reality. Even though my parents guarded against advertising by telling me how it worked (""they're trying to trick you so you spend more money""), none of us realized how insidious it actually was. Maybe when my parents were growing up advertising was more overt because people hadn't discovered how to tune it out yet. Anyway, many advertisements got into my head and stayed there for years, from toy advertisements shaping my desires as a child to the beauty industry making me hate myself as a preteen and young adult.

The most vivid example I can remember is a TV commercial for a life sized toy dog attached to a leash. It was a miniature something or other with long white hair and there was a flip switch on the end of the leash to turn it on and make it walk. The ad on TV showed a group of girls walking down a city sidewalk talking and laughing while walking this ridiculous toy dog. I had REAL dogs at home that I could play with or take for walks whenever I wanted! Having a real live dog would have been any other kid's dream. But I wanted that toy so badly that I begged my parents for months to buy it for me. They initially refused because they knew I wasn't going to play with it and it was pretty expensive by today's standards, let alone twenty years ago. They just could not understand why I wanted it so much and at the time I didn't really understand either. 

Let me pause for a moment and give you some helpful background information. I grew up as an only child. We lived in the mountains outside of town where the houses were at least half a mile apart if not more. Going into town for groceries, clothes shopping and appointments meant thirty to forty minutes in the car just to get there. Then add in the time it took to run errands and drive in between each place and ""going to town"" was a full day affair. Going to school meant a half hour on the school bus which I hated because there were bullies. There were other kids within walking distance that I was friends with by default but we didn't have any common interests. We were friends because there was no one else around to play with. I had friends from school I got along with quite well but seeing them outside of school meant getting one of my parents to drive me and then thirty minutes in the car. (I just want to say here that my parents were great about being willing to drive me places, sometimes with very little notice. But that's not the point.) I'm not trying to bash the place where I grew up because it was wonderful in many ways and there was definitely more good than bad. I just want you to understand why I wanted this toy so badly that I saw on TV.

Fast forward to the TV commercial with the little white dog. Looking back on it now I understand. The ad made me envision living in a city where I could just walk out the front door and spontaneously meet friends. I imagined being able to walk down the block to a friend's house or ride a bike to school. Even though I very much enjoyed my life in the mountains, there was a lonely part of me that desperately wanted the convenience of having everything close by. If we want to investigate how deep the layers go with the psychological effects of ads and media, we can question how I got that image of a city kid in the first place and why I thought most ""normal"" kids were like that. The idea probably came from sit coms and cartoons on TV which were no more real than the toy commercial.

So anyway, my parents finally gave in and bought me the toy dog. They probably prefaced the purchase with ""are you sure you really want it that badly?"" and ""you'd better actually play with it"" but I don't remember. I just remember inviting the neighbor kids over and excitedly saying ""look what I have!"" We all thought it was pretty cool for about ten minutes until we realized it didn't work outside on the uneven terrain (we didn't have paved sidewalks). We abandoned the dog in favor of running around outside. I remember thinking I should try to play with it because it was so expensive. I really did feel bad about it but as a child I wasn't able to examine or articulate those guilty feelings, so I just tried to ignore the toy dog by putting it in the back of the closet. Thinking back on it I still feel bad that someone bought me that expensive toy that I didn't use. 

What are some of your experiences with advertising? When you were growing up did anyone teach you about advertising or how to avoid it? I believe advertising to small children should be illegal because they dont have the maturity needed to sort through the mess of thoughts and emotions caused by advertising. Everyone's experience is different though and I'd love to hear about someone else's.

**Tl;Dr** - When I was a child I saw an ad for a toy on TV. I desperately wanted the toy, not because of the toy itself, but because of the content of the ad. Until I was an adult looking back on it, I did not realize the extent of psychological manipulation going on.  Anyone else have any experiences to share?

1265054880.0	awt8t	Is capitalism possible without consumerism?		20	2	9	"Some recent reading has really got me thinking about consumerism, and just the amount of time, energy, and resources that are wasted in the big treadmill that comes out of it.  But my thinking has gone deeper into why consumerism has come about in the first place, and as a result, I'm finding that I'm questioning if it's possible for capitalist economies to get out of the cycle of consumerism?

That's what I'm questioning here - is it possible for a capitalist society, in an environment of plenty*, to exist without falling into consumerism?  I can't imagine it any other way.  Humanity has become so efficient at using resources to provide the basics for everyone that only a small percentage of people are involved in doing so.  Thus we have a large percentage of people who are able to work, but are not needed to provide for everyone else - but as we're a capitalist society, those people need to work to make the money to buy the things they require to survive, so they then have to make and provide things and services that aren't needed.  These then have a need to be sold to people, and so on.

In other words, it looks like that because we've chosen an economy that requires people to buy the necessities of life with money, as if they're scarce resources, then we need to find reasons for everyone to work to earn that money.  People are pushed to consume to make sure that others get paid to produce, just because that's the only way that most people can have the jobs they need to stay alive.  If the majority of people were to stop all that excess consumption, it seems like our economy would fall apart, with masses of people out of work, because we've come to depend on an economy of consumption.

Am I wrong here?  I'd really be interested in seeing how capitalism could work without this reliance on consumption - and even better if there are ideas as to how to get there.


(*I want to call out the environment of plenty, because it does seem that a society where the work of everyone is required just to provide enough for everyone to live, would end up not being consumerist, because there isn't room for it.  I don't know, however, if such a state is stable.  But that's not what I'm really interested in here.)"	t5_2r83n	True

1353197030.0	13dia9	What does anticon think of insect-farming to replace meat?	akrabu	21	6	25	"Maybe not in our generation or the next, but as much as I like eating meat and fish, our current practices will eventually become unsustainable. There are some in-between steps we could take to slow our impending inability to farm some animals. We could replace some species with others, raise livestock based on native species, etc.

One thing we can do in our own lives is replace our meat purchases with meat that we raised on our own. But how do you do that if you live in an apartment? Microfarming insects!

-----------------------------------------

**Here is my guide to building and maintaining insect microfarms**

Since my DIY everything AMA was mostly a bust. I remembered that I once built an indoor insect microfarm that consumed very little and produced a lot of food.

* First off, we raised **meal worms** and **crickets**. We bought 20 of each from a pet store to start our colony. they both cost around two US dollars.

* **Container:** We used two plastic storage containers that were roughly 20-30 gallons for the enclosures. They were both tall-sided type because crickets duh, but meal worms turn into beetles as adults that can get around better than the grubs. 

* **Air** We drilled a bunch of tiny holes in the lids ala 5 year old catching bugs in their backyard. Good air circulation is important and next time I get serious about microfarming I will be adding low power PC fans to the enclosures and using scraps of window screen in the build.

* **Heat and Light:** We added a light socket to each enclosure and added 5 watt CFLs for light and heat, to be run 24/7 except in the summer. We put them into the top of the plastic tubs but not in the lids so we would have light to wrangle up our livestock with and the critters wouldn't get stuck to the light bulbs. In my next build I will use LED christmas lights since they are less than or close to one watt. 

* **Cricket Bedding:** Crickets need sand to lay their eggs. I would be careful what sand you use. If you buy it at the hardware store, play sand is more expensive but less likely to release small amounts of the different types of dust that can become permanently embedded in your lungs. Or you could just dig up some gravel, mix it into water and sift out the larger particles with a screen, put those particles into clean water, agitate and rinse, then boil those particles and dry them before use. 

* **Mealworm Bedding:** Meal worms live in their food. Whatever cheap quick oats you can find or have laying around works well as a starter bedding. You could use any sort of dry meal though, I bet rice would work but I don't know if they would eat it. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN YOUR MEALWORM FARM THAT YOU WOULDN'T EAT. Like cardboard or newspaper. Crickets love egg cartons to hide under. I gave some to my mealworms and they ate it and subsequently had to wait a few generations after removal because those mealworms tasted horrible.

* **IMPORTANT NOTE ON FOOD:** PESTICIDES! If you peeled something that people do not typically eat the peel of, do not feed it to your insects unless you know it came from an organic farm that uses no pesticides. Citrus fruits and banana peels can have a lot of pesticide on them.

* **Feed for Crickets:** I haven't found a lot of vegetation that crickets won't eat. If they ate through all of our fruit and vegetable scraps I could just go outside and get a handful of leaves, grass, edible weeds, etc. and they would devour that too. They loved apple cores and when I had a colony of 2,000 or so I could toss one in there and it would be nothing but seeds, stem, and skin in 20 or so minutes. You can't watch them eat because they are afraid of the giant hand in the sky. If you raise them the pet store way they need stupid mineral supplements. They don't have mineral deficiency when you feed them a balanced diet and give them regular yard scraps to eat. The pet store reptile feed crickets are mineral deficient because they feed them a sterile grain food only. Then of course they also get to sell you that mineral powder because they engineered nutrient deficient crickets.

* **Water for Crickets:** Crickets need a water source, but it can't be a little dish of water because they are dumb and drown in it. They will drown in millimeter deep water, especially the newly hatched nymphs which look like fleas. So they need a sponge of some type to drink from. 

* **Mealworm Food and Water:** Mealworms also love apples and they love greens and lettuce. Mealworms do not need water because they will get their water from vegetable scraps. Dandelions are a favorite of theirs too, they love the blossoms and stems. Mealworms need daily vegetation to snack on. Any sort of grain scraps you have can be added to their bedding. We gave them lots of bread crusts. One time some French bread went stale so I tossed it to them and they loved it and bored all through the middle of it. But then they were impossible to get out of there. 

* **Cricket Tank Features:** Crickets will eat each other. They needs lots of variously sized places to get away from each other and to lay their eggs. Covering the bottom sand with large flat rocks is great for breeding. Also cutting egg cartons in half and stacking them on top of each other loosely into apartments is great and makes harvesting easy. *(Meal worms don't need features and are easy to harvest by hand.)*

* **Harvesting and Preparing Crickets:** Having egg cartons in the cricket enclosure is really the only way I have found to reasonably harvest them. Chasing crickets around by hand is too time consuming. They will come out dirty so toss them in an airtight container and freeze them to knock them out. Be careful, they won't be dead yet, if they warm up before they are dead they will start hopping around. Preheat your oven to 300 during this step. Then after 20 or so minutes quickly rinse them in a colander with cold water and quickly toss them onto a clean baking sheet and into the oven. Start at 300, after 5 minutes drop the temperature down to 200 and I don't know exactly how long it takes I never set timers for anything. Maybe 30 minutes? The idea is to kill them quickly with the heat and then dry-roast them, slightly roasted and completely dry. You can season them prior to roasting too. Smoked salt on dry-roasted crickets tastes like bacon bits and even people who said they'd never eat crickets end up chowing on them at parties. There's one more thing you need to do after roasting before you eat them. You should put them all into a brown paper bag and shake the fuck out of it to knock off all of their legs and other pokey parts. Then sift those out in a colander. You can eat the legs, but they will stab you in the gums in all kinds strange ways.

* **Preparing Mealworms:** Dry roasted they are good, they have a fairly neutral flavor so they can be added to other dishes any way you please. If you have a food processor or blender they can go raw straight into smoothies or hummus or anything like that. They are great in chili and stews too.  

I have a video on a backup drive of the farms. I will be attempting to rescue that data later this evening.

For any who might doubt this is ok, I live in Denmark, that's how the system works and you'll just have to trust me.

In any case I pulled the topic ""consumerism"" from the pile, and wanted to talk about brands, mostly thinking about Apple overcharging ridiculous amounts for their products.

What I'd like to ask you, is to give your opinion about consumerism in general and some pros/cons. I'd also like to ask what you think of well-established brands and what it does to the market in regards of new manufacturers trying to get a share.

Now I'm in a funk, feeling sick, and wishing I could just get rid of half the crap I own. But some of it is my sisters, most would go to a landfill, and that thought in itself makes me feel worse.

Stuffed animals would normally be thrown in an incinerator, drawings in a landfill or incinerator, and make a big polluted mess of the earth. So now I feel worse, as I don't want to toss out all those things and make the environment worse.

Five things:

1. I apologize for not keeping things up to date and staying in better touch. Being new prevents me from communicating at a decent pace, even with my email confirmed. Also, there are times when I try to have a life outside the net. Take heart then, in the knowledge that I am seldom successful. ;)

2. The first plan of NexGen_Alliance was to be private and selective in who would submit posts, participate, etc. That plan is no longer feasible if the Alliance os to grow at a decent pace or gain the attention of those who might be interested. Hence, the reddit is now public. Soon, I will try to obtain the assistance of /pimpmyreddit and other such communities.

3. I come with this message bearing gifts. These texts will provide us with a starting point from which to brainstorm:

* https://rapidshare.com/files/291702503/BeautifulTrouble.pdf
* https://rapidshare.com/files/913044070/re-imaginingChange.pdf

4. A user by the name of keskiyonaurinko submited an excellent idea of setting up a kind of sidebar directory like /r/shitredditsays and its subreddits have. I will be in contact with /reddithax to figure out how to do it. If there are any other suggestions for the sidebar, such an inspirational description of the reddit, I am more than happy to hear them.

5. It has been made very clear to me that we need some kind of plan of action to effect change in the world. However, before we can quantify a plan, we must first quantify our goals. And before we can quantify our goals, we must quantify our concerns. We must number and itemize those things which is tugging at our heartstrings and compels us to join up. IMHO, we must focus our crosshairs on the following things:

* The idea that everything is somebody else's problem. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem#Psychology))
* Learned helplessness ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness))
* Cultural Hedgemony ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony))
* Instrumental rationality ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality))
* Repressive desublimation ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressive_desublimation))
* Capture bonding ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome))
* The lack of fully mutual knowledge ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_knowledge_(logic)))
* Enforced dependency (A term sociologists use for the creation of a class or group of people who are forced to rely on another more powerful class or group for the essentials of life.)
* Reductionism in Education
* The Baroque Mentality (A mindset characterized by a focus on eccentric redundancy and noisy abundance of details)

In addition, it is my request that each reddit who recieves this post quantify their concerns in the comments. This post will also be on /r/NexGen_Alliance and people are invited to post their comments there also.

What is your opinion on such a card? Is using one for travel benefits as bad as one that just lets you collect points for special purchases?

I personally think that Open-source software is the way society needs to go, but it is dificult, because most people don't understand the monopoly that microsoft has, 
and that they can actually ""own"" their OS and software, not just trust a large corporation.  

I think more people need to recognize the benefits of community , non-centralized software.

I believe that information should be free, and patents are a bad idea.  people should be open to lettings others see how they do something, so that we all can gain.

Imagine as an example if everyone was made to pay 5k$ per year as public transit taxes. That turns out into a $1.5T yearly budget - more than enough to provide every city with luxury-grade trains, tramways, metros, busses, bike rentals, etc. with the added benefit of reducing mean time spent in transportation, reducing pollution and consumption of gas, etc.

I know that public transportation has its own problems, but with such an incredible budget we could just throw money at these problems (more specifically, hire engineers, ethicists, urban planners, artists...) to fix them.

People collect and consume until it is out of control by other people's standards. 

It seems there is an emotional connection to the material. 

Is this emotional connection to material latent in all of us, only usually overshadowed by stronger emotional connections in our relationships with our loved ones, work, etc? 

With hoarders and their increased collection of material-- is this only this conditioned affinity presenting itself in the forefront, as they are unable to continue with stronger, more meaningful, personal emotional connections? If this is the case, (as this phenomenon isn't seen in places where people aren't exposed to psychological conditioning in consumption advertising from an early age) then should be more done to explain this to the majority?

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:

1339016587.0	uolbr	Thoughts on OverConsumption: Is the Government responsible?	theorymeltfool	32	20	43	"In response to this thread over on /r/politicaldiscussion: [When did Greed become an American Value,](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/um3z5/when_did_greed_become_an_american_value/) I made the following comment:

&gt; As a society, why are we so focused on profit at the expense of lives and our country?

I think this occured when politicians were able to step in and break up monopolies, and companies had to fight back. There's a few books about how, during the Gilded Age, customers liked the Rockefellers and other big companies because they provided cheap services. It was the *competitors* that named them ""Robber Barons,"" and donated to politicians that enacted laws to help them beat these so-called Robber Barons. This is when companies had to start lobbying in order to fight back against the political encroachment. And now things are all fucked up. 

Your question is also very loaded. What do you mean by 'expense of lives and our country'? Our government has been killing far more people than corporations ever could. The entire reason why our country is going down the economic hole is due to politicians and the Government.

&gt; The US ones are far more focused on money and materialism, which psychologically makes people less concerned with each other.

I don't think it's fair to make a blanket statement like this. Costco is very focused on bringing the best products to their customers at a reasonable price. So is Target. Patagonia recently released an ad stating that it's not a good idea to buy too much of their products if the customer can't afford it.

&gt; which psychologically makes people less concerned with each other. The article cites a few studies which show a link between this.

I think a lot of this has to do with Government. This was talked about on /r/anarcho_capitalism a few months ago. When people are forced to rely on government for charity and services, they are less likely to rely on each other. In some cities, it's *illegal* to feed homeless people. How fucked up is that? The Government forced dependence on us by enacting laws. Retirement, (social security) helping poor people, (Medicaid and Welfare) helping old people, (Medicare) and a myriad of other Government programs makes people subservient to the Government, and makes others blind to their plight, since they think ""I already paid for Welfare, what are you crying to me for?"" If people kept more of their money, they'd be able to help out others far more than the Government ever could. There are more than financial ways to help people out, and that is what the Government and Politicians can't ever understand.

&gt; Turns out focusing on materialism instead of community stimulates a different sensation of reward in the brain.

Yup, and even this has been outlawed by the Government. The Native American's used to have large festivals where everyone would bring food and goods to trade. Now those are illegal since they weren't giving the Government it's 'dime' in the form of forced taxation.

&gt; Thus, our focus on profit and materialism is quite literally destroying our country.

Blame the Government. You can't do *anything* in this country without having to pay taxes. The Government is the entity that is focused on profits, since that's where it gets its revenue from. If the Government didn't levy property taxes, then you'd be able to live in a house, have a farm, and sustain yourself. Since it's illegal to do that unless you live on the street, not that many people are able to. This is why the Government has been increasing in size since forever, and also the reason why they keep printing more money to keep financing all of their wars and other bullshit. No corporations (except for banks, technically, even though this is only possible because they are backed by the Government) are allowed to just print money. The Government is so hell-bent on Consumption that it needs to *print money* in order to survive. And, they make it illegal for you or anyone else to use a competing currency! The Federal Government is the one that created $16,000,000,000,000 in debt. No company, or any amount of companies, has anywhere close to that amount of debt, or over consumption. The Government is by far the greediest entity the world has ever seen.

If you want strong communities, the first step is to get rid of the Government. Without it, people will take care of each other.


**TL;DR:** I think the Government is responsible for our 'consumerist' culture, since if you don't work (and thus create products for consumption) in order to pay property taxes (among other taxes), you go to jail.

What does /r/anticonsumption think of this hypothesis? That the government is responsible for all of this Overconsumption, and my thoughts that we'd all be a lot better off without a Government."	t5_2r83n	True

But how?	cryptorchidism	13	1	8	"I've decided that I will no longer, to the best of my ability, directly monetarily support corporate entities. Is this even possible? I think it just might be:

**Food:** I live near several farmer's markets. It looks like I'll be devoting a little more of my budget to food in order to buy local and from real people, not corporate demi-gods.

**Durable goods:** Craigslist is an amazing resource. I may not get what I want immediately, but most large purchases I'll need to make (computers, clothes, furniture, etc) are on craigslist constantly.

**Transportation:** This one's a bit tricky. I bike as much as I can, but for some trips that's just not feasible. I'm contemplating getting a small scooter that'll get me around 100 mpg, but I'd still be supporting oil companies. Needs more consideration.

**Disposables:** TP may be a problem. I've ditched almost all other disposable goods (paper towels, napkins, disposable dishes, Swiffers, etc) in favor of reusable versions. Trash bags are easy; Get them free out of the ""recycling"" bin in any supermarket. I wonder if [Dr Bronner's](http://www.drbronner.com/) is a corporation?

**Communications:** Neighborhood WiFi. VoIP phone service, on a used iPod Touch. Still researching my options. Use AdBlock Plus with non-corporate whitelisting to avoid supporting corporate entities through advertising revenue.

**Media/Entertainment:** This one's easy. Do I really need to go in to it?

**Banking:** No idea how I would do this. The local credit union is certainly *less* evil, but I want to ditch the bitch entirely. Any recommendations for how to obtain the necessities of modern life (plastic, checks, etc) would be appreciated.

**Housing:** Currently renting from a human landlord.

**Healthcare:** I get sick, I'm fucked.

This is just something to keep in mind because I feel like this'll get downvoted to the bowels of hell because I'm not necessarily going to espouse good anti-consumption habits here.

I don't spend too much money; I buy things when I need them. Sometimes they're expensive, sometimes they're not. But I'm not really in dire need of credit either way; I pay off the balance each month unless I have a 0% deal and I my checking account is running low.

Nonetheless, I can't stop getting credit cards, it seems. I have six now. Six! All brand spanking new. I've closed two more in the past year to prevent myself from paying the annual fee. I take pride in being frugal, putting money in my savings account, etc etc. But I keep getting this warm fuzzy feeling whenever I start thinking about credit card benefits (Ooooh! 3% back AND the card is made completely of steel! etc etc).

I'm not exactly proud of it, but the habit hasn't caused me any problems thus far. I still can't figure out why I'm so obsessed though. Is it the status symbol? The savings benefits?

I found some familiarity with the movie *Up in the Air*, the moment where they started sharing their credit cards. I get that way about frequent flyer cards, too.

Sorry about posting this here; I'm sure credit cards are a toxic subject around here, but there isn't really a subreddit for them.

**TL;DR: I'm in love with credit cards without being particularly in need of credit or status, but I can't figure out why.**"	t5_2r83n	True

What about going to Concerts to support local and nationally touring bands that I enjoy?

I am an avid outdoorsman and I would love nothing more than to live off the grid for my life and take only what I need.  However, I as well as the rest of us live in a world in which we have material needs and wants that require us to consume and consume often.  If you guys could give me some type of solution or alternative to consumption, I would be all ears (or eyes in this case). Help me out.	t5_2r83n	True

My uncle hired me in his own advertising and PR firm that he owns and has taken me under his wing.  My uncle is not a nice man.  His life really is like on Mad Men.  He is a functioning alcoholic, does a bit of cocaine, cheats on his wife with 500 dollar an hour prostitutes, has a sick sports car and a wardrobe of expensive suits.  But he is incredibly creative and smart.  He can talk his way out of a paperbag.  It is stunning to watch.  I think he might be a sociopath. 

I on the other hand, am not a sociopath.   I have a love hate relationship with the world of advertising and PR. I only have an entry level job but I get to help with some of the campaigns.  I love it because I can use my creativity to solve a puzzle and to alter people's behavior so that they consume or do things.  There is something that feels so powerful about that.  It's very easy because most of the masses aren't critical thinkers.  I also feel guilty about this.  I think that I should switch to working with a non-profit organization once I get more experience and if this continues to bother me.  

 I dislike consumerism and dont have much interest in pop culture or trends.  I deleted my facebook page.  I dont know who the latest  version of Justin Beiber is.  I want to get rid of my TV. But I need to keep up with these things to be good at my job.  Is there a short cut to keep up with these things to be good at my job. 

Is there some sort of 'TLDR' that I can take advantage of?"	t5_2r83n	True

I had a idea to make a short documentary on black friday shopping. My main idea is to go to stores and film the craziness of hectic black friday shoppers. Then interview certain people, (try to get the most variety possible) and ask them questions like ""What are you getting?"" ""What makes it better than what you have?"" ect... Then I will ask deeper questions like ""What is your passion in life?"" ""What makes you the happiest?"" and for younger people ""What do you see yourself doing in 10 years?"" I really want to capture peoples naive expectations on how this new things will make their lives better, and then focus on serious things that give them true happiness.

I would love to hear what you guys have to say, all feedback is appreciated! "	t5_2r83n	True
