Hey guys.
We've got some pretty terrible news to report. Upon returning home to our house in LA we discovered that we'd been robbed while were out on tour. The thieves were able to get away with Javier's Chevy Blazer and all of the equipment we didn't have on tour with us. 10 guitars in total. This includes many of our one of a kind custom instruments (Stranberg,Rick Toone ) as well as amplifiers, PA equipment and personal items.
This is beyond devastating. We know so many of you have been beyond supportive with Javier's legal troubles. We may need more of your help now to potentially find some of these one of a kind instruments that may pop up on Ebay, Craigslist, pawn shops, used music stores etc.
We're adding an album containing photos and detailed descriptions of the stolen gear to our profile. Please take a look and keep your eyes open for anything that looks close to this stuff. I truly think that with your help we have an exponentially better chance of tracking some of this down.

Thanks,
Tosin, Javier

I was a good friend of thedicktater and I was as deeply saddened about his passing. With permission of his family I have started a memorial fund to benefit is wife and his little girl. *Mods please help me with this part* the site you can donate is 
http://www.youcaring.com/the_dicktater  you don't have to donate even just leaving kind words for his family will do. Any questions feel free to pm me. Thanks! soze

EDIT: the ""goal"" is arbitrary donations will be taken even after ""goal"" is met

EDIT2: Thanks to your overwhelming support, we were able to meet practically meet our initial goal of $5,000 within 3 hours of initiating this fundraiser for the Dickson Family -- having met the initial goal so quickly, we are raising the goal to $10,000. Thank you very much for your support once again!

EDIT3: Alright guys I mean seriously was thedicktater that awesome? YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT HE WAS!!! second goal in less than 24 hrs!!!! someone said this ""It's a testament of how many people thedicktater touched."" and he's absolutely right!!! The feels, its so great!! I would just like to thank you all for your help and for getting the word out there. I appreciate everyone telling me thanks but look into the mirror and give yourself one too cause without all of y'alls help this would not be possible. We're bumping it up again let's see how long this takes!!! You guys keep on bringing it I'll keep on changing it. 

UPDATE: just an update guys, as whats8 said this memorial fund has gone waaaay passed anyone's expectations! Its sitting at a little above $22,000!!! I had the opportunity to have dinner with taters family and the one thing that his wife thanked me for was not the money that has been raised but for showing her just how many people cared about thedicktater and his family. Her and her family are so thankful for the donations but mainly for the kind thoughts and words that everyone has shared. Cheers guys!! keep up the great work!"	t5_2s3pe	True

In case you forgot over the last 6 months, the community and us agreed to implement this hall of fame, with one rule for you guys to follow: no submissions of songs that are already on the hall of fame. So, our subreddit as of now has a blacklist of a whopping 10 songs! It's only gonna keep growing, so you'd better enjoy your freedom before this subreddit turns into a police state ;)

So, why did this take so freaking long? Well, we actually couldn't find anyone to write the bio, so we just sort of sat on it until I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and write the bio myself. I'm not a DT expert, so it's possible I got some details wrong, and I'm willing to edit the bio to fix any problems you notice. 

The next round of voting will come up soon, and we promise that the process will work much faster to get the second band on the hall of fame. Word has it that whats8 will write the next bio if nobody steps up, so it shouldn't stall this time. Keep tuned!"	t5_2s3pe	True

I'll send a link to this page to the band and let them know they can answer any additional questions here.  No guarantees on a response though.

------------------------------------------------

**PocketRat**

&gt;With the number of instruments you guys play, how do you handle live performances of your songs which require more than one instrument per band member?


We have on occasion brought an extra person (Dave Bodie from Kayo Dot)  to play percussion with us on stage.  We usually leave out any extra stuff that we can't physically do, but we do 99.9 percent of what is on the cd.  

&gt;I can't find lyrics for your songs anywhere online. I got the bandcamp download of your album, but that didn't come with lyrics. Any chance of you guys uploading them to bandcamp/facebook in the future?


Yeah, lots of people have been requesting it.  Our original idea was to have people make their own interpretation... we'll get them up soon !
&gt;Is there gonna be another kickstarter for your next album?
Probably, we're really broke and do everything DIY so it's really the fans that make our thing possible.  

**Rockztar**

&gt;If you had to answer honestly, how do you feel about pop musicians being praised by millions, while for example progressive metal bands probably make a much bigger effort to create their music by investing time into learning instruments, theory, writing the complex music etc., but still often struggle to get by? Does it bother you at all that Justin Bieber can sing ""baby, baby, baby"" and get money and girls thrown at him compared to the effort that musicians such as yourself make?


We make our music for the sake of artistic expression, not as some kind of grand marketing scheme, so that kind of stuff doesn't really bother us.  We are able to create the music that we want without any outside meddling, that within itself is a great reward.  Justin Bieber can sing?!  Whaaaa?!?!


**Diesel590**

&gt;How do you guys view people who pirate your albums?


We are flattered.  But please buy our album so we can make a new one!  

**Ksd13**

&gt;To the guitarist: Why are some (all?) songs played on a fretless guitar? Does it make it easier to slide notes up and down? Does it allow you to play microtones? Do you simply prefer the tone of a fretless? Or is it something else?


The fretless guitar opens up the door to a different type of expression on the guitar.  It's very vocal, much like a slide.  But it's like having a slide on every finger!  Yes you can play microtones.  Also I love the timbre of the fretless with the violin!! 


&gt;To the rest of the band: A lot of your songs have a lot of different parts going off at once, with the guitar, violin, and horns all playing different melodies. How do you organize all those parts together and keep it from sounding like shit?


We write it together and we don't like things that sound like shit.  Our writing process is pretty meticulous.  We often score things out and we have small section rehearsals to fine tune everything.  

**Dr_Stephen_Colbert**

&gt;Any general date when your next album will be released?


Late 2013.  Very late.  

&gt;Any plans to leave NJ for a tour in 2013? I would love to see you if you came to Chicago.


We can't leave NJ.  Ellis has a running man esque dog collar that will blow his head up.  But seriously, we would love to but it's just a matter of making sure we can break even.  It's pricey to bring all seven of us on the road and the risk of playing for an empty venue is too much for us right now, as we have to save for our new record.  We will be heading up the west coast at the end of January for a few private performances at the NAMM convention.  

**Publix_Illuminati**

&gt;Salvatore, a lot of people have compared your vocals to Michael Jackson. Is he a big influence of yours? What other vocalists have influenced your unique style?


Yes, he's definitely a big influence of mine.  Some others:  Maynard, Tori Amos, Freddie Mercury, and Scott Weiland!  

&gt;Since there are so many elements to your music, how long would you say it takes you all to write a single song?


It kinda depends on the tune.  Coming up with the basic idea is a quick process but we fine tune and adjust things for  A WHILE.  We put the songs under a giant microscope and tear them apart.  We want to make sure we do the best job we can.  
**Moonohol**

&gt;Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?


Yes, seven times.  


**Octavaryum**

&gt;Was the beginning vocals in Feed the Horses an homage to Michael Jackson?


It wasn't intended to be that, I guess it was sort of a subconscious thing.  

&gt;Are you guys influenced by any metal bands?


Absolutely.  The real heavy stuff. Like Nickleback.  Just kidding.  Of course we dig metal!  Opeth, Between the Buried and Me, Protest the Hero, Dillinger Escape Plan, Pantera, Sikth, Gojira, Dead Empires, East of the Wall, Thought Industry...lots of stuff!  


**descartesbedamned**

&gt;What do you guys all listen to? I'm curious as to your influences, of course, but what's on your playlist right now?


Brecker Brothers, Princes Purple Rain, Beach Boys Pet Sounds, Mr. Bungle, Jellyfish Spilt Milk, Sun Ra, Farquhar, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Toro Takemitsu, The Meters, Animals as Leaders, Frank Zappa, P.F.M., Gentle Giant, Harry Nilsson, Fiona Apple.  We're all over the place!

**Daxten**

&gt;Which guitars and are they moded (PUs etc.) Which amps?


On maps I used a telecaster I mod'ed with a seth lover humbucker in the neck position (inspired by my buddy Mark Stanley from Farquhar!), and a vigier surfreter fretless.  Right now I'm rocking a Vigier Expert in place of the tele for live shows.  I put true single coils in it and an illitch noiseless back plate.  
**WhiteEternalKnight**

&gt;What is the inspiration behind the album cover for Maps Of Non-Existent Places? Album covers are very important to the music for me, so I figured there were certain reasons (maybe not necessarily ""inspirations"" but possibly symbols) that you included for some significance. For example, the ""now in stereo"" text at the top makes it feel old-timey, and the ghost-like face gives it a dark, creepy feel. Also it has a very scientific feel because of the charts and waves behind all of the objects.


We just raided old science books and various wacky publications and gave what we found to john bryan of revolution dream design, who did an incredible job!  He reworked it a lot for us and finally we came up with something that captured the vibe of the music.  Glad you liked it!


**Krahslucas**

&gt;To the Guitarist: Who are your major influences?


Ron Thal, Allan Holdsworth, Lenny Breau, Ed Bickert, Ted Greene, George Van Eps, George Benson, Ralph Towner, Wayne Krantz, Ben Monder, Scott Henderson, Kurt Rosenwinkel, lots of dudes!

&gt;What made you decide to get a fretless guitar?


Bumblefoot got me into them! 

&gt;How do you feel about 7- or 8- string guitars?


They are totally cool!  I have enough trouble with six strings though!  I think Charlie Hunter has that domain on lock down!

&gt;Any words of advice to aspiring young guitarists?


Don't get into the guitarist thing of only practicing chops.  Developing an ear and solid time are the most important thing!  Also don't be afraid to step out of your stylistic comfort zone!

**inhalingsounds**

&gt;Considering the diversity of instruments, how's your music background? Do you have any sort of classical training? This goes in the lines of ""how did your instruments meet?""


Yes we do.  There's 4 music degrees in the band.  The other guys graduated from the school of hard knocks.  Or something.   We all play jazz and classical music outside of Thank You Scientist.  

**00ubermensch**

&gt;What was it like getting all the members of the band together and organized? Seeing as there are so many different instruments and styles involved in your music, it seems it would be a bit more complicated than just getting together a rock band with guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. Also just in general, how was the concept of the band created, and how did it change from the first idea to what it finally ended up being?


We started off as a boy band.  That didn't work out because we're too gosh darn cute.  So we settled on doing this large ensemble prog thing.  It is a bit more complicated dealing with the instrumentation we have vs. a traditional rock band.  We have to worry about intonation, ensemble blend, and a wider range of dynamic possibilities.   


**andyman1125**

&gt;What is it like managing a 7-piece band completely free from a record label? How difficult is it to finance tours, recording, equipment, etc?

We do the best we can with what we have.  None of us get paid, all the money the band makes goes back to the band.  That is why fan support is so vital to making it happen!!

**JTheGuitarist**

&gt;How long have you guys been playing your respective instruments? The talent is amazing.


Sal has been singing for 18 years.  Greg has been playing bass for 13 years.  Russ has been playing violin for 18 years.  Andrew has been playing trumpet for twelve years.  Ellis has been playing saxophone for 14 years.  Odin has been playing drums for 18 years.  I (tom) have been playing guitar for about 13 years.   Glad you dig it!

&gt;How knowledgeable in music theory are each of you?

Yes we are all well versed.  We are all trained musicians in the band.  Theory is just a way to explain musical events, it's a great way to communicate ideas quickly to the other band members.  It aids in the writing but it isn't part of the artistic process.  Does that make sense? 

**zxczxc19**

&gt;Are you gonna tour Europe ? IF (or when :) , since I wish ), please include Slovakia or Austria - Wien at least


We'd love to!  It's just a matter of making it financially possible. 


**reasonlol**

&gt;Recently started listening to you guys and it sounds great, I was just wondering what some of the less obvious influences in your work were and if there were any prog albums released this year that you particularly enjoyed.

Billy Joel, Todd Rundgren, Emmitt Rhodes, XTC, Gruvis Malt, Stevie Wonder, Prince.  Sal really loves early 90s freestyle.  Greg loves Ace of Base.  Odin is a big Marc Anthony (the stuff in spanish).  Ellis loves Manowar and Eloy.  Prog released this year?  The new Farquhar album is crazy.  Also The Tea Club and Elixir on Mute.  Great stuff! 

**machine123456789**

&gt;What do you guys do in your spare time?


What is spare time?  We are constantly working on music!  Either on our own or with the band.  

**wafflingwaffle**

&gt;How did you guys form? Did you all go into this with the goal of making jazz/rock/fusion music like we hear on the albums, or did it sort of evolve naturally over time?


We went into it knowing we wanted to do something ambitious and different but still accessible  for a wide-ish range of music listeners.  


**kyraycverd**

&gt;Do you plan on doing a tour around the States?


Yes of course, we just need some help in the finance department!


**nullmiah**

&gt;What is your band name from? Is it a reference to Half-baked?


No, just a phrase we though sounded like our music.  It just kinda works.  A lot of people think it's a half baked reference though!  


**elfstone666**

&gt;What are your favorite bands/musicians?


See Above!

&gt;Do you have any offers from major labels given the good response to ""Maps...""?


Yes but we can't really talk about it! 

**JLP2005**

&gt;Could the guitarist(s)? Please list their rigs, pedals, etc?

Vigier Expert with some hand wound pickups and illitch back plate.  Soldano SLO 100 head.  My pedal board changes frequently.  The mainstays are my bb pre-amp, boss super shifter, line 6 delay mod, and crybaby.  Very simple set up.  I also use A Vigier Surfreter Fretless guitar and a Tsugaru Shamisen!  
	

**atremains**

&gt;Who's call was giant steps? Have you experimented with excerpting changes from any other standards? (Maybe I even missed some on the album?) I've had some success tinkering with the changes from ladybird in a progressive metal setting.


We have a copule jazz musicians in the band.  We play lots of ""standard"" oriented gigs outside of the band.  We just thought it would be a cool opportunity for us to play over some changes in the band setting, as those kind of harmonies aren't often featured in rock bands.  Ladybird metal sounds cool to me!

&gt;It seems you guys have an endorsement/partnership with vigier. If so, is there an interesting story to how this developed?

Bumblefoot came to one of our shows with the US rep for Vigier (DJ, the bassist from Dead Empires).  The rest is history. Greg and I play their guitars.  We love 'em!

&gt;What effect did Ron thal have on your recording?

Ron mastered our first EP and came in to help us mix ""maps"" for a day.  He's a great friend, we love the dude!  Not to mention he's one of the most bad ass musicians around! "	t5_2s3pe	True

**[Animals as Leaders - Animals as Leaders] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAyIJNqbqTE)**

Animals as Leaders debut self titled album dropped in 2009 to rave reviews and launched the career of Tosin Abasi far beyond his successes with previous band, Reflux, as well as showcasing his technical abilities as a guitarist. 

Animals as Leaders, co-written by Misha Mansoor of Periphery/Bulb fame, combines Djent style polyrhythms with jazz inspired structures and riffs and helped pioneer the widespread use of 8 string extended range guitars.

1349003994.0	10pgpw	Recommended Listening for all	Re-Define	72	13	88	"**Opeth**

- Ghost Reveries

Phenomenal album. By far my favorite of theirs

- Blackwater Park

A close second for Opeth's best album in my opinion and their most critically acclaimed.

**Dream Theater**

- Scenes from a Memory

Definitely a progressive classic. If you don't have a copy then what are you doing with your life?

- Octavarium

The album that showcases everything Dream Theater has to offer all in one place.

**Pain of Salvation**

- BE

One of the most incredible concept albums I've ever heard. Give it a listen and when you're done, listen to it again.

- Scarsick

Definitely not for everyone but one of the most eclectic progressive records from PoS.

**Transatlantic**

- Bridge Across Forever

A little bit more polished, albeit shorter, than 'The Whirlwind' whilst still retaining some great epics.

**Porcupine Tree**

- Fear of a Blank Planet

Arguably the best Porcupine Tree album released, although the most metal influenced.

- In Absentia

A bit less metal than Fear of a Blank Planet, In Absentia is full of great progressive songwriting.

**Coheed and Cambria**

- Good Apollo I’m Burning Star IV: Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness

My personal favorite Coheed album. I think it has the best songwriting of them all. I did a full review of the album here http://intellectualnoise.tumblr.com/post/22584566299/coheed-cambrias-good-apollo-im-burning-star-iv

**James LaBrie**

- Static Impulse

A solid metal album which waivers on the edge of progressive and melodic death.

**Pink Floyd**

- The Wall

An absoulute classic. Nothing else can be said. Listen to this now!

**Blackfield**

- Blackfield II

The best release from Blackfield out of the three album's they've released.ore Steven Wilson goodness here.

**John Petrucci**

- Suspended Animation

A great guitar solo album that actually has solid songwriting that doesn't always rely on guitar shreddery.

**Kamelot**

- Epica

Another fantastic concept album. Cheesy at times, but that's to be expected with symphonic metal. Definitely get a copy.

**Katatonia**

- Night is the New Day

Ambient, sad, brutal and reflective. Truly an amazing record.

- Dead End Kings

Close to 'Night is the New Day' with a touch more progressive song writing.

**Liquid Tension Experiment**

- Liquid Tension Experiment 2

All the Dream Theater instrumental goodness with a jazz fusion-esque flavour to it.

**Riverside**

- Anno Domini High Definition

The best release from this Polish outfit. Grab a copy and enjoy.

**Circus Maximus**

- The 1st Chapter

A fairly solid progressive album which can at times leave some more to be desired. A strong Dream Theater influence can be found, but that's not such a bad thing in this case.

**Steven Wilson**

- Grace For Drowning

One of the best album to come out in 2011. Progressive rock at it's finest. I did a full review of the album here http://intellectualnoise.tumblr.com/post/22584538089/steven-wilsons-grace-for-drowning-review

- Insurgentes

Steven Wilson approaches song writing with an interesting style on this release. Expect lots of sad songs with a lot of noise.

**Storm Corrosion**

- Storm Corrosion

Steven Wilson and Mikael Akerfeldt team up to make a phenomenal dark, progressive album. I did a full review of the album here http://intellectualnoise.tumblr.com/post/22584590664/storm-corrosion-album-review

**TesseracT**

- One

Another of the best albums released in 2011. Every track is incredible in it's own right. Give it a spin.

**Animals as Leaders**

- Animals as Leaders

A progressive instrumental album done right. Incredible guitar work here.

**Cog**

- Sharing Space

One of the best bands to come out of Australia. Sharing Space is the first album I heard of theirs and loved it all the way through.

**David Maxim Micic**

- Bilo EP

Ambient, heavy, groovy and smart. The Bilo EP showcases why David Maxim Micic is one of the best Djent acts around.

- Bilo 2.0

Equally, if not more, phenomenal as the original Bilo EP. For a more in depth look at it you can read my full review here http://intellectualnoise.tumblr.com/post/24323493942/bilo-2-0.

**Frost***

- Milliontown

The title track alone is enough to make this album worth your while. Grab a copy and prepare to have the time of your life.

**Guilt Machine**

- On This Perfect Day

A great progressive album from Arjen Lucassen. Definitely worth a listen.

**Haken**

- Visions

Haken are a band that wear their influences for all to see, but still bring their own ideas to the table. 

**Scale the Summit**

- The Collective

Scale the Summit are like a more song driven Animals as Leaders. Great guitar work throughout.

**Abigail's Ghost**

- Selling Insincerity

Although at time's they sound like a Porcupine Tree rip off their song writing is seriously up there. If you didn't know better you could mistake it for a PT record.

**Anathema**

- We're Here Because We're Here

Soft, ambient, symphonic and beautiful. We're Here Because We're Here is a great example of how you don't have to be hard hitting to be progressive.

- Weather Systems

Building off what 'We're Here Because We're Here' built, Weather Systems is bigger and better in every way.

**Karnivool**

- Sound Awake

In my opinion the best band to come out of Australia. Heavily influenced by the likes of Tool, Karnivool are an amazing band and Sound Awake is an incredible album.

**Demians**

- Mute

For a solo project of a relatively unknown artist, Mute is a fantastic release with exceptional song writing.

**The Devin Townsend Project**

- Epicloud

Loud, catchy and accessible. Epicloud may not be the most heavy or progressive Townsend project, but it's my favorite.

**Diablo Swing Orchestra**

- Sing Along Songs for the Damned &amp; Delirious

Big band swing and metal fuse to create a chaotic masterpiece that will take your mind on a weird and wonderful journey.

**The Pineapple Thief**

- Tightly Unwound

Imagine if Radiohead were a progressive band. That's The Pineapple Thief in a nutshell. Recommended for newcomers and seasoned prog listeners alike.

**Sky Sanctuary**

- Insert Coin(s)

Djent and 8 bit video game music combine to create a brutal, playful journey.

1346925433.0	zfyn3	Let's discuss Djent. How do we all feel about it?	Re-Define	76	16	152	"There's a lot of people who always comment that Djent ""isn't even a genre"" and that ""all Djent is just a Meshuggah ripoff"". I find these statements to be extremely close minded and ignorant. But that's not what I want to discuss here.

I would like to see what everyone on /r/progmetal thinks about this (relatively) new genre of music.

Personally I have a love/hate relationship with Djent. I in no way see myself a Djent fan boy, nor do I actually like a large majority of the bands. I do however, love the ones I like.

I LOVE Tesseract. One is my favourite album of all time. I find their playing to be extremely groovy and technical whilst still maintaining a proper song structure and flow.

Animals as Leaders are another Djent band that I look up to largely. They make some of the most interesting and complex music without sounding overly self indulgent.

The same could be said about another great Djent artist; David Maxim Micic. Bilo and Bilo 2.0 were phenomenal records and both had a great blending of technicality and song writing.

Whereas I cannot bring myself to listen to other big Djent bands such a Periphery, Vildhjarta, Textures, Veil of Maya, Uneven Structure and Meshuggah. All of these bands, to me, don't have the same tact that I find in Tesseract. I feel as though the Djent genre is being plagued by this need to fill their songs with self indulgent speed playing; losing sight on what really made the genre for me, *the groove*. Not to mention the sudden influx of (dare I say) metalcore-esque vocals that, in my opinion, ruin the songs.

But that's just my opinion. I'd love to hear what yours."	t5_2s3pe	True

1364843203.0	1bfxbj	Official /r/ProgMetal Announcement. Very Important.	whats8	68	9	22	"I will get straight to the point.

As of today we will be segregating the community so as to appease all the various complainers we have to deal with on a daily basis. 

* For traditional progressive metal, you make your way over to /r/tradprog.

* For progressive metal with any core influences, you can make your way over to /r/progcore. 

* For Djent, there is already /r/djent, where you will be expected to go. 

* For instrumental, take it to /r/instruprog. 

* And for anything in between, you will have to post in /r/clusterfuckprog.

You're probably wondering where that leaves /r/progmetal? There will be no music links allowed from this point onward. This community will now serve as a discussion hub for all geners of prog metal. We are also sick of posting our weekly discussion topics so that will be ceased as of today. 

We are tired of dealing with the people who think their definition of prog is more correct that another's. This is the only solution us mods could all agree on. We will not be creating the above subreddits--you guys can deal with that. 

We suspect this decision will be met with some moderate backlash but we know the majority of you will understand. 

**Edit:**

**Yup, it's fake. Happy Fools of April!**

Best:

""If one cut the source of the flow  
And everything would change  
Would conviction fall  
In the shadow of the righteous  
The phantasm of your mind  
Might be calling you to go  
Defying the forgotten morals  
Where the victim is the prey""  

Ghost of Perdition - Opeth

If you love metal, guitar solos, cats, and reddit. You WILL cast your vote for Last Chance to Reason here:

https://www.facebook.com/SummerSlaughterTour?sk=app_126231547426086&amp;app_data

Thank you guys in advance, and I hope to see a lot of you in the summer.

1360532375.0	189mmk	Hey /r/progmetal, I don't listen to metal, but I would like to develop a taste. I figure progmetal would be a good stepping stone for me to do that, so could you guys give me some recommendations (I have some specifications in the text).	PapauNewGuinea	59	9	98	"Okay, the first thing I'd like is minimal screaming. I can tolerate screaming, but I've never thought anything along the lines of ""I'm glad the singer is screaming right now."" It's alright if there is considerable screaming, but I'd prefer there not to be. 

I'm totally fine with instrumental music, if that makes the minimal screaming bit easier. 

I like songs to have some structural complexity (I guess that goes without saying in Prog Metal).  

A good melody is nice.

Since I'm not into metal (yet), I probably won't like the more heavy stuff. 

A few songs I like from the front page: 

Insomnium - Unsung

Protest the Hero - Reign of Unending Terror 

Stick Men - Fugue (musical fusion is always nice)

Cloudkicker - #

I like Mastadon, but I am not a fan of Meshuggah (I mention these because they are pretty much the only Prog Metal bands I knew about before a week ago). 

Hope this helps show what I'm looking for. If I can, I'll try and say more in the comments.

edit: You guys are awesome.

Another thing to add, I really like music I can jam out to. Opeth really gets me jamming. "	t5_2s3pe	True

The progmetal genre often have many instruments playing at the same time creating complex soundscapes.
I myself would have a very hard time listening to progressive music on bad speakers, headphones or youtube. 

I see tons of youtube links here (rather low quality) 
Although it is the easiest way to share I would instead recomend spotify which oftentimes is much better (although it does not always exist)

Dr_Stephen_Colbert	57	7	20	"[Stolen](http://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/hj8al/101_rules_of_prog_metal_funny/) from /u/thedicktater (RIP) who stole it from metalstorm.net which probably stole it from somewhere else. I stumbled across this post while searching for the band Three and had a good laugh. Hopefully its alright that I repost it.

1. Insist that your definition of prog metal is sacred and that the only progressive bands are the one you deem to be so.
2. Accuse anyone who disagrees with you regarding rule 1 of lacking musical intelligence and not being a true prog fan.
3. Have contempt for mainstream music.
4. Insist that most people listen not to the music, not to the lyrics but only the chorus and that is why prog metal is not mainstream.
5. Accuse anyone who disagrees with you regarding rule 4 of lacking musical intelligence and not being a true prog fan.
6. When showcasing a new prog metal band to a non-musician friend, put on the most technically difficult song, and skip directly to the solo part.
7. If your friend says that it is cool, tell him that he has grasped the grandeur of prog and shown that his intelligence is superior to that of the mainstream sheep.
8. If he doesn´t, accuse him of lacking musical intelligence and not being a true prog fan.
9. Renounce all contact with friend in rule 8. Racial purity isn´t all bad.
10. Make sure your drummer has a double bass pedal.
11. If he hasn´t, kick him out and get another one who has. Single pedal is NOT prog.
12. Own every side-project a member of Dream Theater has been involved in. Listen to approximately none of them regularly.
13. When a mainstream fool asks you what prog metal is, tell him something along the lines of ""prog is the evolution of musical expression and experimentalism in rock."" In any case, make sure that the person in question is left with no idea of what prog metal is. He wouldn´t have understood anyway.
14. Insist that music should always progress, although as long as you write an album in the prog vein, you don't necessarily have to.
15. Accuse anyone who disagrees with you regarding rule 14 of lacking musical intelligence and not being a true prog fan.
16. Refer to progressive metal as intelligent music for intelligent people, preferably at every occasion where a mainstream group or genre is mentioned.
17. Note that the above does not qualify as arrogance any more than pointing out that wine is drink for the more sophisticated.
18. A song under four minutes is NOT prog. If you are stuck with a song under four minutes, insert a phrygian solo trade-off between the guitarist and keyboardist as long as needed.
19. If a mainstream fool tells you that shredders are mindless wankers, tell him that ""at least they can tune their guitars, har har"", and walk away defiantly.
20. Spocks Beard is NOT prog. If anyone disagrees, kill them.
21. Humming along with the melody to a prog metal song is forbidden. Burn all albums you own with hum-along melodies.
22. Loathe all music you used to like before you got into prog. This is not optional. When asked why, tell people that ""I am into GOOD music now, why would I go back?"".
23. Accuse any prog metal musician that cuts his hair of selling out.
24. Often state that you don´t only listen to prog. Jazz is a good choice.
25. Yeah...like you have more than 3 jazz CDs in your collection...
26. Never accept ANY Berklee graduates. The drop-outs are so much better.
27. Riffs in 4/4 are not progressive. If you happen to come up with a cool riff in 4/4, alternate between 4/4 and progressive time signatures like 7/8 every other measure to ensure the musical complexity synonymous with prog metal.
28. Be able to mention 20 bands noone has heard of, not even true prog fans. Own no releases of these bands.
29. Get an Ibanez. This is not negotiable.
30. Spend 5 hours every day critiquing other musicians on forums.
31. Spend 5 minutes every other day actually practicing your instrument.
32. Yell at people who headbang at concerts: They're not prog enough to get the music, what do they expect?
33. Sus4 is your friend. To ensure that your album is a true progressive release, include at least one part where the keyboard plays ascending sus4 chords over a single-note broken rhythm in 7/8.
34. Make sure your bandname is either a
a) Oxymoron
-Silent Noise
-Tender Harshness
-Healing Gun
Some geeky sounding name ripped from some obscure book.
-Deitronus
-Tarakoch
-Fentaran
or
c) Random combination of at least 2 three-syllable words.
-Eternal Twilight Tranquility (Can't get much progger than that)
-Redolent Arithmetic
-Evolution of Vernacular Domesticated
35. Don't worry about if your band name makes any sense or not. Since 90% of your fanbase is from Brazil and Japan, you can safely ignore conventional English grammar and instead focus on what´s really important: The lyrics (see rule 36).
36. Write deep and ambiguous lyrics.
37. If unable to write deep and ambigous lyrics, include at least one of the following phrases to ensure recognition as lyrical genius in prog circles:
""I'm staring towards ascension divine, caught in my own revelation, a nightly mystery of soulburning apparition""
""Mornings' gentle caress, a ray of sunlight enveloping the spirit of the sleeper ventriloquist""
""A timid, palatable genocide, turn towards the decline of mankind, the festering wound of ages past changes into the soul-spirit of vestigial sentences.""
38. Use a non-standard instrument like violin, saxophone or kazoo, regardless of how idiosyncratic it turns out to be. This constitutes being prog.
39. Make sure your bass-player has as many strings as possible. Don't worry if he uses approximately three of the 11 strings on his custom Carvin 30 kg bass regularly, just give him a bass solo in the middle of your mandatory instrumental tune(more on that later)where he can really show the extent of his instruments capabilities. Imagine the range of scales on an instrument like that!
40. Release a live-album called ""Live in Tokyo"".
41. Change time signatures. Constantly.
42. Accuse anyone who does not do so of lacking musical intelligence and not being a true progressive musician.
43. Your amp MUST be a Mesa Boogie. If a friend of yours tries to convince you´re wrong and you should check out his Marshall tell him that his tone is thin and buzzy.
44. State that Metallica can´t properly tweak the boogies. They´re so... unprog!
45. Start a Dream Theater cover band with friends just starting out playing instruments. Spend half of the rehearsal talking shit about punk bands and how people don't understand your music.
46. Play a shitty version of a humongously difficult DT song at a Battle of the Bands-type contest. Metropolis Part 1 or Dance of Eternity are both good choices, as is Erotomania.
47. When your band ends up last, shift all blame over to the judges; hey, they have no idea what good music is! Why else would they let that boring pop band win?
48. Talking about starting playing an instrument; always start with the most technically difficult song you know. Remember, this is a testament to your immense talent, so be sure to mention this on every internet community you happen to frequent.
49. When are you able to play something at half speed very sloppy, proudly state that you ""nail"" the song in question.
50. People are bound to ask for a recording of the feat mentioned in rule 49. However, you are not able to provide it to them, because a) your recording equipment got dissolved by digestive acid yesterday, you don't need to prove anything to people. Your word should be good enough c) you don't know anything about computers (even though you sit by one most of the day), as you spend most of your day practicing your instrument."	t5_2s3pe	True

1. **Try to post things in the same format**:  Band name - Song name, adding a link and genre (if possible) would also be great! 
2. **Don't repost a band** if you already see it in the comments, just upvote the existing post, or comment on it saying how freaking awesome it is. 
3. **Refrain from down voting bands** you don't like, just upvote those you do. Someone else might enjoy them. 
4. **Only post the one band**, we don't want this turning into a contest to show off how many bands we all know. If a band hasn't been mentioned after a few hours you can always come back and post it later. 
5. **Bands with 'The' in front don't count for the letter T**. So the group The Chasm for instance counts for the letter C.
