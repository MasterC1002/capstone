In a special contest next week, we're going to be doing a subreddit logo contest. I want the best of the best from this sub to enter in that one. I may even convince the other mods to give it a try. 

The flair is taking a little longer to do than I thought, but it'll be here soon enough, I can promise that. But anyway...

**CONTEST RESULTS!**

**1st PLACE** - /u/Hurley_boy24 with [I don't even..](http://imgur.com/YblsWKG)

**2nd PLACE** - /u/LXL15 with [Untitled](http://i.imgur.com/fKTh268.jpg)

**3rd PLACE** - /u/Alysx with [Untitled](http://i.imgur.com/JDRalnh.jpg)

Remember: Logo contest starting next Monday. Submit or Patrick will forever disown you.

* No Reposts. All reposts will be removed. Refer to KarmaDecay

* Content must have Patrick somewhere in the picture

However it is following them based on a loophole in the rules, yes they are pictures of Patrick but they are not what this subreddit was designed for.

&gt; This subreddit is dedicated to putting Patrick Star templates into pictures of all kind.

So Mods, you have the final say in this matter. Are pictures like [This](http://www.misterhonk.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Patrick_Star_by_Brushcommander.jpg) the the same as [This](http://i.imgur.com/9EpAJ0u.jpg), or do [these](http://www.misterhonk.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Patrick_Star_by_Brushcommander.jpg) pictures not belong on the subreddit because they are not Pictures *WITH* Patrick, but rather Pictures *OF* Patrick.

1358215187.0	16l9uw	MOD-POST - ANNOUNCEMENT - No limitations on which Patrick you use / Call for templates	SevererOfTies	43	6	23	"Since we want to make this subreddit all that it can be we will no longer be limiting links to just the original ""Patrick with his mouth open"" pics.

That being said, this post is a call to arms for all you creative folks out there to post any templates of new Patricks that they would like to share with the community. I will be organizing any and all approved templates onto an imgur album for everyone to use so you can either post them here or send them directly to me

Note: We ask that templates be posted in .PNG format with any background removed.

I'd also like to thank this community for growing so quickly and given us so many excellent new pictures with Patrick!

Edit: The start of the [album.](http://imgur.com/a/ql37Z)

Edit: Submissions for templates should be full body shots of Patrick so they can be used in any project.

~~Instead of deciding on something we couldn't even force on people to do, we decided to give you the opportunity to use a new patrick by providing a new template (Only one for starters).~~

~~If you made another one yourself, or even only found a good scene but lack the proper photoshop skills to cut him out, feel free to post it in this thread.
The templates will probably be added to the sidebar, after this matter has clarity.~~

~~Also, we'd like to hear your Opinion on this matter.~~

EDIT: Instead of deciding on something on our own, we decided to ask the community before creating rules or guidelines. So please write a comment, how you feel about the two possibilites (Always the same Patrick vs. different Patricks).

Example of a different Patrick:

* **All submissions must be posted as comments here in this thread.**

* All submissions must follow the subreddit rules. **ABSOLUTELY NO NSFW OR NSFL CONTENT.** This will be seen by everyone, visitors and subscribers. We gotta look good to the newcomers.

* All templates are allowed, and creativity is encouraged. 

* The resolution should be fairly small, preferably 100px tall and, for wide logos, around 175-225px would be good. If you don't like working with small objects, make it to where it won't be completely butchered when I minimize it. 

I think that's it. This will last until Friday, April 26th. Please vote as much as possible, but remember that only upvotes will count. Downvotes don't mean shit around these parts, so don't do it. Also remember that the tread will be in contest mode so only I'll be able to see the points. Please vote as much as you want.

1368485401.0	1e9xwa	[MODPOST] HUGE CSS overhaul and reminder of rules.	ZombieLoveChild	25	5	0	"**TL;DR - New CSS, stricter repost rules, reminder of request rules.**

Hey guys! 

Since the changes should be pretty obvious, a new CSS template has been put in to place (credit to /u/ashishtiwari for the template). Now, this is incredibly new to me; definitely the most complex CSS I've ever worked with. So this, at the moment, is a work in progress. I hope that by the end of the week most of the big issues are fixed and it'll look amazing. 

Now, over the past couple of week, nicePenguin and I have noticed that there is A LOT of top images getting reposted daily. Hell, even some of our own work is getting reposted. Now, this is not tolerated in the sub. So please look at through our threads before you post something. If it is a blatant repost, it will be removed without question. If you are repost an image from the top results of the sub more than five times, you will get a ban. And please, for the love of everything holy, PLEASE report reposts. Lets keep this a fantastic sub! Use karmadecay.com to check pictures. 

Also, as most of our loyal subscribers saw a couple of days ago, a request made the top of the sub with nearly 400 points. No patrick anywhere in the pic. This is unacceptable. The only reason it stayed up so long is because we were offline at that time (exams are a bitch). So all requests must be made into self posts and marked with the [REQUEST] tag. Any requests that do not follow this rule will be removed.

That's it for now. Let's keep this place amazing, shall we? Thank you for taking your time to read this!"	t5_2w01t	True
