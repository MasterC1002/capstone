1) Waking up every day to repeat one single day of your life. There is a random given day, that you will live for the rest of your life, you can't choose it. No matter what you do, the next morning you'll wake up how you would wake up normally on that day. You will have the memory from the previous days, so you will know you are stuck in loop. You would live like that for the rest of your life, based on your given life expectancy (if normally you would die at the age of 80, you would continue this loop for so many days, until you would have turned 80)

or...

2) Every morning you wake up to a random day of your life - for example one day you can wake up as a grandpa, the other day as a teenager. The actions that you do WILL change the future days you will possibly be waking up to. Your memory DOES NOT adjust - if you wake up as a teenager, you have no idea what have you been doing at the time unless you've been living some close day recently. It's like someone triggered a shuffle button on your life. Much like the first one, you would live through all of the days of your life - all of them, but only once for every one - and then die (again, based on your life expectancy)

Which one will you choose?

EDIT: Correcting a logical mistake here: Since actions from the 2) scenario can affect the future, the day of your death is given and you can do nothing to extend/shorten your life, even if it took a miracle to correct that. For example, if you tried to commit suicide, you would 100% fail unless it would be the day of your death. Wow, this sounds extremly sadistic... I better stop typing."	t5_2qr1y	True

* You become so obsessed with the book that you spend all of your time rereading it again and again, and watching all kind of related movies or cartoons, reading articles, etc., effectively stopping to live your life;

* You learn something that you have never wanted to learn, and that either endangers your life, or makes you heavily depressed or overly paranoid;

widespread attempts to release the entire truth would most likely alienate the public and/or have government agents tracking you. But hey, you know all of history and can influence it to a certain degree

By influencing history significantly, you would change history but there is a catch. ~~You either are remembered as a good figure who saved many lives and is remembered for greatness (say Martin Luther King Jr. or Einstein) or a disastrous one, remembered for completely fucking up and putting our society back a couple of notches (say Hitler).

- living in an anime would result in you living in a sort of any category ( for example, you could end up in a slice of life, a hentai, or a murder series), your death may be early in the series, if not, it's certain at a point, so you WILL die somewhere along the line.
