I'm looking for anyone who is in a similar situation and would be willing to exchange these vouchers.

1312809488.0	jcd4g	In case anyone cares, portable battery powered Wii console....	Vermilion	30	3	2	"American... I'm traveling much of the next six months... I softmodded my Wii and converted all my games to a USB hard drive. I'm also using Dolphin on an i7 laptop.  I'm going to try and travel _without_ all the game discs, and have meticulous records and scans of all my game disc purchases.  This also gives me some benefit from airport theft... I'd rather have a $130 console stolen than $ of all my game disc collection.

I've been debating if the laptop + Dolphin alone is good enough. A couple good games don't work with Dolphin (CSI: Deadly is one). The Wii is a pretty small console to take in checked baggage, but you have NTSC/PAL issues and I'm going to be spending time in another former British colony.... but now I have a Pico 640x480 projector I got for cheap clearance at Radio Shack ;) Works great with both Dolphin and the Wii console.

Anyway, the Wii power brick is 60Hz only... so I decided to see if I could get one of my XPal battery packs to run the Wii. I ordered a second Wii power brick from Amazon for $4.50... despite the third-party seller claiming it was 50/60Hz, it is only 60Hz. So I gutted it and took the cable...

XPal/Energizer XP8000 I carry for phone charging has a 12volt output option. So I cabled it up. Works great! It is max rated at 3AMP output, the Wii PSU says 3.7... but my experience is that the XPal can go over the rated output (and I suspect with only one USB device and no gamecube controllers plugged in, the console is 3 amps or less draw anyway).

I tested for 30 minutes with a USB portable hard drive running off the Wii... seems great so far! I also had the WiFi on at the same time... and played some very heavy-load games.

So now I can just inline the XPal charger brick to Wii and not have to carry another power brick.

tldr; the XPal XP8000 or XP18000 battery packs, using the green 9-12v output port - can be used to power a NTSC Wii Console, even with a USB hard drive powered off the Wii."	t5_2qi9g	True

1373087710.0	1hqh7p	An ode to Wii	Camellia_sinensis	37	8	14	"The last console I ever bought before buying a Wii two days ago was an Xbox 360.  Prior to that, I kept up with video games - N64, Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, Playstation, DS... I was quite into games. 

Anyways, I got hooked on Halo for awhile and that was fun but truthfully got pretty boring. I never got into CoD because I got bored of Xbox 360 all together and sold it for cash to a random friend's uncle one day. 

So, at 15, I sort of gave up on videogames. I dabbled but never really consistently played anything much. 

When the Wii came out, I remember thinking, ""Ehhh, but I want a 360.  It's got Halo!""  And I looked over the Wii for a good 7 years. Recently, I saw a post about the newest Smash Bros. on reddit and had a business suit cat ""I should buy a Wii"" moment. 

What an awesome investment. I really didn't know what to expect. I played Mario Kart Double Dash for maybe an hour on GameCube back in the day and it just wasn't as good as Mario Kart 64. But woah. Mario Kart Wii just makes me feel like I'm 9 again playing N64 and eating crappy Ellios pizza with my best friends!  I'm 23 now and to get that kind of kick out of a game like that means a lot to me. Oddly enough, my old best friend from since I was 4 is now going to be my roommate as of this fall and we're both excited to split the cost of a Wii U with our other roommates so we can all play Smash Bros. and whatnot again. 

So anyways, I just wanna say thanks to Nintendo and thanks to the Wii for still proving that video games can be a unique and creative experience. Games like Mario Kart Wii and Super Mario Galaxy prove to me that gaming is not an art that is dying under the weight of so many uncreative shooters filled with dark colors and crap blowing up everywhere. I'm into bright colors and Italian plumbers jumping on mushrooms and dinosaurs on go-karts. "	t5_2qi9g	True

**Disclaimer**

Modding your Wii can be dangerous. I, the mods, nor anyone else at r/wii is responsible for any “bricked” or broken Wii’s. To prevent a bricked Wii, read and follow [mauifrog’s guide on brick prevention](http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/44104-brick-prevention-things-you-should-never-do.html) found on Wiihacks. Finally, the moderators at r/wii do not condone or promote piracy. Do not ask for links to pirated material. 


**Benefits**

That said, modding your Wii provides many benefits an unmodded Wii does not normally have. One can play user created “homebrew” games, engage in emulators for a variety of owned consoles and game engines, and most importantly, have the ability to back up your own Wii games to play off of an external hard drive. 


**Modding**

I am no expert, but I will try to pass on the knowledge I have gained through my own experiences. In addition, this information will degrade with time. New homebrew hacks and methods come out frequently; it is best to use the most up to date guides. [**Wiihacks**]( http://www.wiihacks.com/), [**Wiibrew**](http://wiibrew.org), [**CompleteSoftmodGuide**](http://sites.google.com/site/completesg/) and [**GBAtemp**](http://wiki.gbatemp.net) are excellent resources for information regarding this material. My guide is just a collection of links accumulated over time.

For further information on what homebrew and Wii hacking and modding is, read [GBAtemp’s FAQ]( http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/Wii_Hacking_FAQ). Should you decide to mod your Wii, you will first need to hack it (the equivalent of jailbreaking it) to start the modding process. If you have System Menu 4.3 you can hack your Wii with [Letterbomb](http://hackmii.com/2011/08/letterbomb/). Letterbomb is an exploit that allows you use HackMii to hack your virgin Wii and subsequently do modifications to it. It requires you to [determine your Wii's [MAC address](http://snap.gmu.edu/console.html#wii) and input it into the easy to use [LetterBomb](http://please.hackmii.com/) downloader. The other popular option to mod your Wii is to use [mauifrog’s guide on wiihacks.com]( http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/96886-guide-softmod-any-wii.html), and works regardless of system menu version. These two methods will allow you to actually start using homebrew stuff.

It is essential to have brick deterrents as stated in mauifrog's guide. After following the above guides, ensure that [BootMii](http://bootmii.org/download/) is installed as an ios, as well as [Priiloader](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Priiloader). Make sure to check if Priiloader will turn on, by holding the reset button while turning on the Wii, and that you can access BootMii from Priiloader. Also make sure to create a NAND (Wii system memory) backup in BootMii, as this will be a copy of you Wii and can be used to recover from certain bricks. 

The next step is to upgrade all your cIOS and IOS's, which are kind of like the operating system for the Wii. This can be accomplished with [ModMii](http://modmii.zzl.org/), an **excellent** program that can update said cIOS/IOS as well as easily mod your Wii with USB loaders, NAND emulators, GameCube loaders, and much more. To update all your cIOS/IOS's, simply install SysCheck to your SD Card from [Wiibrew](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/SysCheckGX), run the check, and take the output file SysCheck provides and run it with ModMii. ModMii will download all necessary files and generate a guide for you to follow to bring your Wii up to date.

Once this is completed, you are free to do whatever you please with your Wii. The [Homebrew Browser](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser) can be used to remotely download and install homebrew directly to your Wii through a wifi connection. Here are some recommended homebrew apps available from the Homebrew Browser:

* **SNES GX** - Super Nintendo Emulator
* **FCE Ultra GX** - NES Emulator
* **Genesis Plus** - Sega Genesis Emulator
* **Visual Boy Advance** - Gameboy/Gameboy Advance Emulator
* **WiiMC** - Media center for DVD's, video/pic/music files, and online media capabilities
* **Super Mario War Wii** - Battle game with Nintendo characters
* **Quake Wii** - Original Quake using the Wii Zapper

Some homebrew requires manual download and installation, such as NAND emulation, USB game loading, and mods of emulators and games. First are cover mods. The very kind Wiimpathy has modded FCE Ultra GX, SNES GX, and Visual Boy Advance to allow for [coverflow style menus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pKbpBjKVWjY). Although these versions of emulators are not officially supported by the original emulator coders, they may be preferred to because of their aesthetics. Both of these cover mods can be found [at GBAtemp](http://gbatemp.net/topic/303645-snes9xgx-cover-co/). Mastershoes has kindly compiled NES, Gameboy/Gameboy Advance, and SNES covers, which can be found on [Post #175 of this GBAtemp post](http://gbatemp.net/topic/303645-snes9xgx-cover-co/page__st__165)

Game modders have changed Super Smash Bros Brawl to their liking, such as emulating the gameplay style and mechanics of Super Smash Bros Melee. Project M and several other mods, including Brawl+ and Brawl-, can be found at [Smashmods](http://www.smashmods.com/). Other game modders have created entire levels and worlds in New Super Mario Bros Wii. Mods such as [Another Super Mario Bros Wii](http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-games/75382-another-super-mario-bros-wii-released.html) and the [Newer Super Mario Bros Wii Holiday Special](http://rvlution.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=891) show the dedication of the modding community. 

There are also a myriad of homebrew games and applications that you can download and install straight to your Wii using the H[omebrew Browser](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Browser). The most popular applications can be seen at [CodeMii](http://www.codemii.com/hbbstats.php), and a nice video showcasing them can be seen [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18CqpLWVxCw)

The best perk by far of modding your Wii is to play Wii games off a USB external hard drive. Compatible hard drives for the Wii can be found at [GBAtemp](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/USB_Devices_Compatibility_List). There are several USB loader programs available. A table comparing the perks of the different USB loaders can be found on [GBAtemp](http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/USB_Loader_Releases). A popular USB loader is [Wiiflow](http://www.wiiflowiki.com/Wiiflow/), again due to its [aesthetics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNB07m6JSa8). An installation guide is found on the [Wiiflow website](http://www.wiiflowiki.com/Wiiflow) as well as on the [Wiihacks site](http://www.wiihacks.com/other-faq-guides-tutorials/41364-wiiflow-installation-settings.html). Wiiflow and all other USB loaders can also be installed using [ModMii](http://modmii.zzl.org/). Another thing to note are the different file systems structures available for use with USB harddrives, including NTFS, WBFS, and FAT32. All file systems work, but the most recommended is FAT32 for its ability to be read by computer and its compatibility with Homebrew applications. A FAT32 formatting guide can be found on [Wiihacks](http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/96770-guide-fat32.html).

After all your homebrew is installed you may want to have a nice channel in your system menu to open it, rather than having to go through the Homebrew Channel. There are different methods for installing these channels, but I recommend to use “channel forwarders” rather than installing a full application to your Wii’s nand. Some forwarders can be found at [Wiihacks]( http://www.wiihacks.com/wii-custom-software-hacks-applications/76114-forwarders.html), and can be installed with [Wad Manager](http://www.wiihacks.com/homebrew/20085-recommended-wad-manager.html). More channel forwarders can be found by searching GBAtemp and Wiihacks. 

If you have problems with hacking/modding your Wii, post a message to /r/wii or to the kind people at [Wiihacks](http://www.wiihacks.com/). Please, do your diligence and search for an answer in the aforementioned sites before asking. A bricked Wii is never a good thing, but if you follow the proper steps and precautions you too will enjoy the wonders of Wii homebrew.  "	t5_2qi9g	True

This allows you to run homebrew on a **completely unmodded Wii**. Simply prepare an SD card and then use any existing exploit (such as Bannerbomb or Letterbomb) to launch Casper as and when you want it.

By using Casper to launch [NEEK](http://code.google.com/p/custom-di/downloads/list) you can just insert a pre-prepared SD card and connect up a USB drive to **any Wii** and launch your exploit of choice to boot into a completely emulated Wii environment with full access to homebrew and backup launching. Handy if you just want to pop around to a friend's place with all your game backups. Or simply to show how awesome a modded Wii is to those who haven't yet taken the plunge.

As usual XFlak's [ModMii](http://gbatemp.net/t207126-modmii-for-windows) is bang up-to-date and will download Casper for you - simply use it's new 'Abstinence Wizard'.

I like RPG (paper mario, 8-bit Zelda and Dragon Warrior), and side-scrolling mario. The super mario galaxies were about the farthest I ever went from my comfort zone into 3D but I did love them!  I did NOT like Zelda Twilight Princess however.  I don't care for FPS either.  And although I don't expect my kids to play with me, I do prefer games that they can be in the same room with (no gore or terrifying monsters).

I understand hardcore gamers who are used to using a keyboard or punching buttons, who cares about the interface, I guess.  But the idea behind the Wii is that it is a better interface that is more physical.  Isn't how to use the interface, and have that interface really encoded in how the game works, important to others?

For example, Wii Sports Resort Swordplay is a great game, because the position of the sword is actually the position of the Wii remote.  Training in swordplay can actually help you in this game.

On the other hand, the lightsabers duel game is awful in this way.  The position of your lightsaber is not at all tied to your position of the Wii remote.  It considers ""slash"" as just another button to press.  Let me tell you, if you actually moved your sword up-down up-down slash slash in an actual sword fight, you'd be dead, you wouldn't trigger a combo move.  Awful.

Am I the only one who cares about this?  Is there a website of Wii game reviews in which these topics are even mentioned?

You can use the normal [d2x installer](http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios-installer/) with the new [v7 modules](http://code.google.com/p/d2x-cios/), or just have [ModMii](http://gbatemp.net/topic/207126-modmii-for-windows/) download fully patched WADs for you. You should only need 249 (base 56) and 250 (base 57).

Below is the v7 changelog (direct copy-paste):


[ d2x v7 ]

- Refactored all modules and plugins in order to achieve code reuse through
  a new common library.
- Updated ciosmaps.xml to include the IRQ4 patch required by the new
  experimental EHCI module (not released yet).  
- Used a more proper offset to detect DL games like Sakura Wars.
- Disabled nand emulation before returning to system menu or channel.
- Improved error 002 fix after ios reload block. Now Wii Fit Plus channel
  installation works properly.
- Fixed missing identification and patch for base IOS60-v6174 in ES plugin.
- Added auto detection of the first FAT partition on the device when nand
  emulation is activated without specifying any partition.
- FAT Module moved a bit forward in memory in order to create the space
  required by the new experimental EHCI module (not released yet).
- Fixed a bug when closing FAT module.
- Fixed an alignement issue on file renaming in FFS plugin.
- Removed support for base IOSs with old version like IOS38 v3610.
- Added ios reload block capability for nand emulation.
- Removed FAT ISO loading support from DIP plugin (never used by any loader
  and completely useless now thanks to fraglist capability added in v6).
- Fixed a memory alignement issue that could break ios reload block.
- Added bidirectional escape for invalid FAT characters in nand emulation.
- Now FAT_GetUsage returns fake values for WiiWare/VirtualConsole and real 
  values taken from FAT for disc-based Wii games. This workaround has proven 
  to improve nand emulation compatibility. 
- Added a thread to make the drive led blink when writing to FAT.
- Added nand emulation mode rev17-like (experimental).
- Fixed COD MW3 online update on full nand emulation. More generally this fix
  should improve compatibility with DLC installation on emulated nand also for
  games like COD Black Ops, Rock Band 3 and Guitar Hero 5.
- Now the tree /import is emulated in partial mode too. This way COD MW3 online
  update and DLC installation work properly in partial emulation.
- Added a hack that allows No More Heroes 2 to create the save file in nand
  emulation mode (tnx to Sneek source).
- Minor changes and code clean up.

Enjoy!

It is not uncommon for consoles to remain supported after the release of a successive console, Playstation 2 for  example just announced that the final title will be released in Japan (a final fantasy expansion title for the MMORPG), so consoles can still receive support if there is the demand.

Since the Wii mini was confirmed, I thought of buying it with Super Smash Bros. Brawl and other cool titles (Skyward Sword). I just started doing my research on the console and noticed there was no Wi-Fi. Is that feature really necessary on the Wii? 

Keeping in mind I switched to PC gaming to play MMOs... is the online community big on the Wii? Or will I be sitting at home for hours looking for someone to play with? 
I really have 0 console experience after the GameCube so I'm not quite sure if the Wi-Fi on the Wii is necessary.

- splitscreen, though 1 screen is preferable. 
- not an fps - i have borderlands, but my wife cant shoot for shit, gets frustrated and rages on the 3 day old controller. 
- fantasy preferred though we will play other settings. 
- co-op only. We fight each other already let alone video games ;)

Now that I finally have my own Wii I'm totally loving it and wish I had bought one earlier. 

One awesome thing is that since it's been out forever, so many games are cheap.  I've only had it for about 2 months now and already I have a good amount of games (I think).  But I'm always looking to get more since I'm going through them pretty fast.  So I'm looking for suggestions and I also just want to hear what other people say their favorite Wii games are.


**One important note:** 
My Wii is a newer generation that doesn't support Gamecube games so that cuts out any of those suggestions.  They started doing this late last year

Games I already own:

* New Super Mario Bros Wii which came bundled with my Wii
* Super Smash Bros Brawl
* Metroid: Other M, fun but I should've bought the Trilogy instead
* Mario Kart Wii
* Zelda Twilight Princess

Games I am strongly considering

* Sin &amp; Punishment Star Successor
* Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga (gf is a big fan of Star Wars and thought we could co-op on this together)
* Metoid Prime Trilogy
* Zelda Skyward Sword
* Dead Space: Extraction
* A Boy and His Blob
* Kirby Epic Yarn
* The Last Story

Since the Wii U is supposedly being released at the end of this year, is it even worth getting the Wii?

This enables you to boot GameCube backups from your Wii's SD card. Details held in [this GBAtemp thread](http://gbatemp.net/topic/307341-dios-mios-and-dios-mios-lite-source-project/).

Also the rather wonderful [postloader3](http://code.google.com/p/postloader/downloads/list) will now launch these backups for you.

Not had time to have a proper play with it - apparently it seems to be working for launching most original GC discs, backup GC discs and GC rips held on an SD card. Note that **USB launching is not possible** as when running in 'GC mode' there's absolutely no USB access. It's therefore impossible and won't be added.

Still launching GC games from SD/SDHC is a nice feature to have for those of us who like the convenience of having all our games immediately to hand without having to mess around with physical media.

As I said, not had much of a play so probably won't be able to answer many questions on this. Submitted it more just to keep you guys informed.

*EDIT: Games should be ripped with [DiscEX](http://code.google.com/p/sneek/downloads/detail?name=DiscEX-v0.8-cred.rar&amp;can=2&amp;q=) (like you do for Wii games launched under SNEEK-DI / UNEEK-DI), which you can get from the [SNEEK Google code download page](http://code.google.com/p/sneek/downloads/list).*"	t5_2qi9g	True

I'm an old-school guy, who first started gaming back in the Coleco-Vision days (then NES, then SNES and Genesis, 3D0, missed the N64 chapter because of college, but did do PS2, then Wii). I don't mean to sound like an old fart or anything, but the whole screen-on-a-controller thing with the Wii U is just too much, leaving me completely disinterested in getting a Wii U. It's too different than what I've always known, and seems way too gimmicky. It's almost alienating.

I am sure they will do the same with the Wii U, but the thing I like about the regular Wii is all the virtual console stuff. I have all my old childhood and teen years packed into one simple, tiny box. I already have everything I need. For the most part, it's all there. Why bother buying the new system? I've seen some demos and stuff for the Wii U, and sure the graphics look interesting, and output will be hi-def, and yadda yadda yadda, but what's the real argument for getting it?

Thoughts?

Thanks!  :)

1302867676.0	gqo8a	Multiple Unnamed Sources Confirm New Nintendo Console.	frenchphrasebook	15	2	24	"* [Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/04/14/new-nintendo-console-at-e3.aspx) has heard from multiple sources that Nintendo will unveil it at E3 this summer if not sooner.
* Nintendo's Wii successor is set to utilise an entirely new controller and will be more powerful than Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, well-placed international industry sources have told [CVG](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/298241/news/wii-2-has-all-new-hd-controller-out-2012-sources/).
* Sources have revealed to Blu-ray.com that Nintendo are looking at including [Blu-ray](http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=6194) as the main optical drive.
* sources tell [IGN](http://wii.ign.com/articles/116/1161875p1.html) that Nintendo will release a pre-announcement this month with a full reveal expected at E3 and that the console will be backwards compatible with current Wii software. 

* A source who previously detailed Sony's NGP before it was announced [has revealed to French site 01net](http://www.destructoid.com/more-nintendo-console-rumors-about-hardware-touchscreen-198922.phtml) that the controller itself is said to include a 6"" single-touch screen, d-pad, ""L and R,"" two triggers, and ""others."" The functionality of the Wii's sensor bar has now been integrated into the controller. Remember [Johhny Lee's 3D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw)?
* Wii Price-cut: A trusted source tells [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/12/nintendo-cutting-wii-price-to-150-on-may-15th/) that the Nintendo Wii will cost just $150 starting May 15th."	t5_2qi9g	True

Please note that I just got my Wii back from Nintendo's repair shop, and I have yet to download any of my games back from the shop.

Anywho, if I backup the Wii's NAND before downloading my software back onto my Wii, transfer the data to the Wii U, then restore my Wii's NAND to the state it was in before, will I still be able to download my purchased games on the Wii?

1357177873.0	15v0rt	Does the black Wii have the loud disc drive problem?	regretdeletingthat	15	3	14	I got a pre-owned white Wii for Christmas and it works great except for the fact that the disc drive buzzes so loud it drowns out my TV and gives me a headache. I know this is a common problem on older Wiis, but buying a new Wii would cost too much and lose me GameCube compatibility, having it repaired by Nintendo would cost 150% of what the console cost and another pre-owned white Wii might just have the same thing happen. So, is anyone aware of the black Wii having this issue? I wouldn't mind getting rid of this one and paying a little extra to get a pre-owned black one. 	t5_2qi9g	True

So I went to the site and it shows you how to install it but it stops at actually telling you how to get a game running. 

Now, I've just bought Zelda SS, the pre-order bundle version. Do I just insert it into the pc Do I need to copy the disk somehow and burn it onto another one? Do the people who use this emulator usually just download an illegal version of the games? 

Go easy on me, I've never pirated a game in my life and am not sure if that's what this involves.

**Can or how can the Nintendo Wii Fit be used to improve the balance of elderly people?**


Basically, I need to get some quantifiable data, I need peoples opinions on the Nintendo Wii Fit. So, I've come up with a questionnaire to try and find out what people find most helpful and enjoyable about the Wii Fit. If some of you could fill in the survey that would be awesome, if you have any elderly relatives which use the Wii Fit it would be absolutely spectacular if you could forward on the link. 

There's nothing you need to sign up for and there's only a few questions!

[Here]( https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?formkey=dFJaQ1RTdmlTcldVc05qcXJtdTBUYWc6MQ) is the questionnaire.

I've had MP:T since it came out, and I'm a completionist. I'd really like to unlock everything this game has to offer, but I don't know anyone else who owns this game.

**I have 25 vouchers to give away.**  **I need 15 credits.**  I'd be really happy to trade with someone!  It looks like you only need 15 credits to unlock everything, so that's all I need, but if there's anyone else who needs credits I'll still give 'em out.

My Wii number is: 5502-5208-8648-4728

Please let me know if you want to trade to ""reserve"" your vouchers.

EDIT 2: I've been working on finding the last few vouchers, for the hell of it.  Just one to go!

EDIT 3: 12 days later.  In case anyone is wondering, I haven't traded any vouchers yet, as no one has given me their friend code.  Still waiting to trade!  I'll keep this post updated with how many I have left, which is still 25.  C'mon guys!"	t5_2qi9g	True

I found out recently he wants Skyward Sword so I'm going to buy that, but it's not too expensive, and I was wondering if there was anything redundant/outdated about the wii I bought 2 years ago? I'm not really too knowledgeable on the wii, and if I go in store I'm afraid they're just going to try and scam an old man. I'm pretty good for my age with tech, but I don't know anything about the Wii. I see the wiis are all black now, is it a new model? Are there newer model remotes or motion/nunchuck things?

Thanks.

1322508066.0	msb2o	To mod, or not to mod...	AeitZean	16	4	44	"I've had my Wii since the console first came out, and I love it. what I dont love is that even with only 20 Wii and 20 gamecube titles, its still a pain in the ass to store the games (I've had to shove them out the way miles from my system) and annoying to have to go fetch one every time I want to change.

I've been looking at softmodding my console, then using something like USB loader GX to shove all my games onto my external hard disk and never have to dig through the games again. This would be good on two levels as I could then export the games to my PC and play them on Dolphin in HD.

I am extremely nervous to do so though. I modded my original PSP when it came out of warranty and the damn thing must've blown a capacitor because after a while of playing emulators on an overclocked CPU It's now a brick. My incompetence therefore has me worried.

I Love my Wii, and really don't want to risk not being able to play new releases (like skyward sword) when I get my hands on it. so to the questions:

How hard is it to use the Letterbomb or Bathax to mod my console?
Which one would be better?
Does installing the homebrew channel overclock the Wii in any way, or do anything to cause it to wear out faster?
Are there any Pros or Cons I haven't thought of?
Are there other things I can do with my modded Wii I haven't thought of?
What tools should I use if not Letterbomb/homebrew channel/USB loader GX?

1322452329.0	mrkog	Wiimote Plus vs. Wii Motion Plus	AbusedCocoaPuff	12	1	19	"Wii hardware is not really my strong point so I'm just seeing if anyone can clear this up.

My roommate and I have both been playing Skyward Sword since it came out. I've beat the game, he has not (he works long hours). Anyway, I never had much problem with the controls in terms of the Wiimote sensing me stabbing or horizontal swinging, the Wiimote getting out of sync, etc.

However, my roommate has problems . . . big problems; he tries to stab, yet it registers as a horizontal swing. He just beat the third temple and had a really hard time doing the boss because of this. Furthermore, his Wiimote gets out of sync a lot. Example: He is flying the bird around and has the Wiimote tilted to the right, but the bird is turning sharp left. If he puts the Wiimote flat, the bird will turn even sharper left.

So what is the difference? We are playing on 2 different Wii's and he has a Wiimotion Plus accessory, while I have a Wiimote Plus. Does the Wiimote Plus work better than the accessory or is he doing something wrong?"	t5_2qi9g	True

Unfortunately, I was correct.  I want to love playing that game and I want to play it more.  I just can't get past the whole controller scheme on the wii for FPS games.  I played maybe 20min of it before I gave up.

I guess if you were a fan of the n64 version and that controller it would be relatively close to the original, but I was terrible using that controller as well.

I wouldn't consider myself a noob gamer by any means.  In fact, quite the opposite as I'm constantly able to top scoreboards on TF2, Halo, CS, and even best my friends time and time again.

It's rather unfortunate that this only came out on the Wii/DS though.

Am I alone in this thought?

** edit:** Thanks for the input guys.  I had a few friends over and we played a ton of 007 with just the 3 of us.  It was incredibly fun, but I still suck balls with the aiming :P  Hopefully I can at least make it through single player.

I want to buy some download games (like OoT and Majora's Mask) but since some of them don't divide evenly into 2000 points (800 point games are ticking me off, but if I see 5 I want then I guess it's not so bad) so I want to find if I can buy codes like with some of the 360 and PS3 stuff.

I have motion plus and a nunchuck, also I've got a gamecube controller somewhere I think. If not I can grab one when I get a gamecube memory card, that copy of Eternal Darkness on the shelf is taunting me. Will I need the classic controller? If so, should I go for the pro version? I'm pretty sure the NES games won't need more than the wiimote, but I know I need a few more buttons for SNES and newer games to work right. Not quite sure how the 64 games will work or what the best controller for them would be.

Lastly, a good place for deals on games since all I have is wii sports and new Super Mario (I got the limited edition red wii bundle). I know Amazon has good deals and is easier to trust sellers there than on ebay, and sometimes GameStop will stop ripping people off long enough to have a legit good deal with ""new"" games selling for half the price of used even if they still lie to you saying those opened games with fingerprints on the disc are new.

I've had a Wii for a couple of years and never really use it.  It sits on my old CRT TV which is in my attic, where I workout in the winter months.  Last year I used it as a media center using MPlayer CE. The Wii is modded with a WiiKey 2 and it also has Homebrew on there.

I never could get it streaming over WiFi using SMB or FTP so I always had to plan ahead and preload a USB stick with video, which got annoying.  I would love to get something better running on it, and was really hoping Boxee would be ported over but it appears like it has not.   I've also considered ordering the new Boxee Box but unfortunately it looks like shit and will not fit on my TV stand beside the TV.  So I was bouncing some ideas around in my head yesterday and thought that maybe if Wii Linux has advanced enough I might be able to load that then install Boxee on it, but I'm not sure if installed software persists and it would be a pain to set it up every time I reboot the thing.

So I'm curious about if people are using their Wiis for media centers, what software they're using and how well it's working for them.  I've been googling the crap out of it but all the info is outdated and it's mostly people whining and saying that it's not powerful to play 1080p or MKV files, which I'm not at all concerned about (regular Divx is all I download)."	t5_2qi9g	True

Okay I started safe and I got Mario Kart Wii, Endless Ocean, Alien Syndrome, Mario Galaxy 1, Conduit, Metroid Prime 3, Other M, SNK Collection and I found used copies of the last story (Aka amazing!!) and Xenoblade chronicles is fucking 100 dollars so. . . I guess I will emulate that or something?

On the first screen where you select which controller you have, we picked the wrong one (we said that we had the attachment, nope) and now it won't let us progress past the screen that says *Connect motion plus accessory and nunchuck* and it won't let us go away from it.



We have tried:
* Hard reset of the console
* Unplugging literally everything from it
* Removing game disc
* Reconnecting the wiimote/removing batteries
* We haven't been able to play, so there is no save data to delete, BUT I still checked anyway.
* We also have the update from the store

Help would really be appreciated!

EDIT: Bought a damn adapter and stuck it on one of our non-MP wiimotes and it lets us pass the screen, but if we go back in with a MP built in remote, it just tells us to put the adapter in and gets stuck back where we started.

1322070512.0	mmx92	The Wii is 5 years old. Let's take some time and reflect on the life of the Wii.	tehsage	15	5	15	"I was playing Skyward Sword last night and I realized that the Wii is five years old now (as of the 19th). I got to thinking about all the great games and how much the gaming industry has changed since the start of the 7th generation of home consoles.


So, let's discuss our thoughts on how the Wii did. What were some of your most surprising moments? What game impressed you the most? What game was the most disappointing? Any thoughts on how the Wii did overall? Favorite game released? Anything you wish would have been different? How did Nintendo do? Are you happy overall with the Wii?

Let us talk about one of *my* personal favorite consoles of all time!

------------------

I think my favorite game released for the Wii now is Skyward Sword. I absolutely loved Twilight Princess but it's obvious that Skyward Sword is what a Wii Zelda was meant to be. Other honorable mentions are Donkey Kong Country Returns, No More Heroes, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

I really wish that there would have been better FPSs on the Wii. Goldeneye and The Conduit were a step in the right direction. Hopefully next generation, these developers will have more comfort working with IR and motion for FPSs (a more powerful console will also help).



So what are your thoughts?"	t5_2qi9g	True

Just a small comment, super metroid and mega man x are my 2 favorite games of all time, and as such I have a lot of ways to play them, that's why I don't know if buying a controller is worth it.

However, I mistakenly purchased a cheap Chinese component cable that cuts off the signal every time someone turns something on/off in the house. It's quite annoying so I thought I'd replace it with one of these HDMI converters. Leaning a bit towards the monoprice one, and hopefully the price will drop a bit more as the Wii U gets more popular.

http://www.neoya.com/shop/wii2hdmi/

I understand that the signal remains at 480p but digital is cleaner than analog so I was hoping this was enough of a benefit to be worth it. My questions for those who have used one of these converters or something similar are:

* Do these converters upscale? I would hope not, but just checking.

* Are they dependable after being used for a period of time? If not, how much playtime did you get out of it before it died?

* Does your converter have any quirks? ex. darker picture, quiet/loud audio, etc

All buttons on the wii and controller have no use, and the only way to make anything happen is to unplug the console and turn it back on. When this happens, the wii doesn't feel hot, or even warm. 

Does anyone know what's causing this? Time for a new motherboard? Is it an issue with the disk drive? I've got it taken apart right now because I wanted to see if anything jumped out at me as being broken, so I could theoretically replace anything. 

When I removed the heatsink, the thermal pads all tore/crumbled. They still felt about what thermal pads should feel like, but I can't reuse them now. Assuming the motherboard is the problem, I've got my eye on this replacement: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Nintendo-Wii-MainBoard-Motherboard-Tested-100-Wor-/280610096112?pt=Video_Games_Accessories&amp;hash=item4155aa43f0

Any input or suggestions where to go from here would be greatly appreciated :)

Edit: I should also mention that the wii is not at all modded, and the games are legitimate retail disks. "	t5_2qi9g	True

I started it up to play and when I did so, I got nothing. The system powered up. But there is no picture or audio. So I decided to send my Wii back to Nintendo to get it repaired. When I did so I received an e-mail stating that the Wii had been tampered with or altered in some way. I could never do that to my Wii. The only time that it had been opened is when I had the ""brawl issue"" and I sent it back and they took care of that for me. I know nobody that would even think, or know how to open up the Wii. When I called NIntendo today to ask them about it, they said there were some screws missing. Screws that would not just fall out on their own. So Unless they were not put back in correctly when I sent the system back for the smash brothers problem. I don't see how it could have happened. I was just really hoping that some one somewhere could help me restore my Wii. 

I have a crazy amount of data stored on there and literally hundreds of dollars worth of virtual console and Wiiware titles and I in no way shape or form wanted to lose all of that...

As a graduation gift to myself I finally decided to buy a Wii. I have been holding out for a long time. I knew that if I had a modern game console, then I might not get my work done.

But now I'm concerned about my purchase. I hooked it up for the first time today and the very first disc I loaded into the system, ""Wii Sports"" displayed a black screen with the error message ""Could not read the disc. For details read the console manual."" I was horrified! I ejected the disc and reloaded it. This time it worked. I played Wii sports for a bit, and then I played Mario Kart Wii for a couple of hours and had a great time. Then my girl friend tried her game, ""Carnival Games."" I put the game into the drive and unfortunately was met with the error message, ""Could not read the disc. For details read the console manual."" I couldn't believe it! I reloaded this game over ten times and got the same message over and over. I can't get this game to play! Both the game and the console are literally brand new.

Ive also found that if you contact nintendo and send in your copy they will send you a new game back.  some people claim they got charged 25 dollars for nintendo to clean their disc.  to test this ""BAD BATCH"" idea I tried the new super mario bros disc that came with the red wii and it worked fine in both systems.  the copy I bought before buying the red wii didnt work still.  anyone know of any fixes I could try at home before dealing with nintendo?

things Ive researched or tested already:

-using the official wii optical lens cleaner.  this helped fix the dual layer brawl problem and helped play xenoblades better (its skipped and bogged down somtimes wouldn't boot up) but still didnt fix the two games in question.

-startup game when error screen comes up put in a game that works to bypass that and then put original game back in.  this didnt work for me worked for a few people on the net but i rather not have to do this everytime i want to play a game.

I have my Wii (red) hooked up through official component cables to my 46"" 1080p Toshiba panel. When I set the Wii to 480p, the left side of the screen is cut off very slightly. I only noticed it when clicking on a channel, the 'bubble' is offset. And when playing Xenoblade Chronicles, sometimes the menu runs off the left side of the screen.

If I set the Wii to 480i, the alignment is fine, and as far as I can tell the resolution is on par with 480p. Is this an issue with my TV not displaying the 480p signal correctly? I don't mind using 480i, it looks fine to me, but I want the best picture possible, and if I'm missing some setting to get 480p working, I would love it."	t5_2qi9g	True

1329786387.0	pylwv	I want to mod my SNES d-pad with the one from a wii classic controller. Would this be possible?	P00pSh00tr	10	2	5	"I dusted off my old Wii and started getting into old NES/SNES/GBA/genesis games again via emulators. While the gamecube controller works fine, it just isn't the same as the classic pads. I found [this adapter](http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=22&amp;products_id=31) that lets me connect the snes controller to the wii. This is perfect but the d-pad on my controller hasn't aged well. It's loose, squeaks and isn't as precise as Nintendo's current dpads. I would make it easy on myself and just use a classic controller, but i hate how you need to connect it to a wii remote. I like to play while standing up so it gets annoying. 

So here's my idea: I want to remove the SNES d-pad and replace it with the one from the wii classic controller. I also plan to change the purple buttons to those sexy white/clear buttons from the wii's as well. I would then paint the controller white to match the wii so it has an old school/ new school aesthetic.  Would my idea even be possible? I don't have a classic controller so I don't even know if the buttons and d-pad would fit."	t5_2qi9g	True

1328036864.0	p4wai	Troubleshooting flickering wii cursor	AndNowMrSerling	10	2	16	"EDIT2: In case someone with the same problem stumbles on this post: Nintendo sent me a new Wii and I got a new router, and the problem STILL occurs. I'm assuming something must have changed in my apartment building, but I'm out of ideas. For now I've just switched my router over to 5GHz to avoid the problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: After much troubleshooting, I've discovered that I'm actually getting interference from my router - with my router unplugged, everything is fine, but if I use my router (say, watching Netflix on my PC) then the flickering starts right up. I tried switching WiFi channels, and even tried another router, but had the same issue. (This other router had the option of using the 5GHz band rather than the usual 2.4Ghz band - switching to 5GHz solved the flickering, but it's not compatible with all my electronics.) The Wii is currently being shipped in to Nintendo, who claims that this is the first time they've ever seen this problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------

I've had my wii for about four months, and it's developed an intermittent problem that has me stumped. The issue is most noticeable in Super Mario Galaxy 2, but it also shows up in other games such as LEGO Batman. When pointing at the screen, the wiimote cursor flickers randomly, either appearing and disappearing (SMG2) or flickering to the edge of the screen and back. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it's happening the wii is basically unusable (it seems to be increasing in frequency over the last couple weeks, so it now happens daily).


Things I've tentatively ruled out:

-Wiimote issues - when the problem is happening, switching to another wiimote doesn't solve the problem. When both wiimotes are used simultaneously in SMG2, both cursors disappear in unison.

-IR interference issues - looking at the Sensitivity screen, I only ever see 2 dots, regardless of the sensitivity setting.

-Game disk issues - this happens in multiple games, and these games previously worked without a problem.


So, I'm guessing that this is an issue with the console itself. Searching online doesn't seem to turn up many others with my problem, so I'm not sure if there's anything I can do besides trying to send it to Nintendo for a repair. (I haven't modded my wii and should still be under warranty.) I'm wondering if the problem is a faulty bluetooth module, which is intermittently losing connection with the remotes. If so, would it be easier for me to just replace this module? I'm reasonably electronically savvy (got my undergrad degree in EE) and the modules are only a few dollars, so if this is definitely the problem then replacing it myself might be easiest.


Does anyone else have any troubleshooting steps I can try? Does anyone know how the repair process through Nintendo works? (What's the turnaround time? For an intermittent problem like this, will they just send it back without fixing it if the problem isn't immediately reproducible on their end? I bought the wii bundle through Amazon, does that affect my warranty at all? Does anyone have experience with ""advance replacement,"" where they send you a new system while yours is being repaired?)"	t5_2qi9g	True

Wii does not support ad hoc networking with a PC. There was something called a USB Dongle that you could buy at one time to make it work, but of course they discontinued the product.

I recently plugged in a Gamecube memory card (off-brand, from Gamestop) to my Wii, and it died.  Let me mention that this memory card had worked perfectly well before.  It was used to complete a playthrough of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance.  

The system was on, since I had just put in Star Wars: Rogue Leader to play for the first time and the screen came up saying ""no memory card.""  I had forgotten to put it in before turning the system on.  Right as I put it in, the system turned off and the power light went out.  

I've tried resetting the AC Adapter by removing it from the Wii and the wall, and all this does is have the Power light turn red once I plug it back in.  Once I attempt to turn the Wii on, either by Wii-Mote or by pressing the power button, the light goes out completely and the system doesn't power up.

Any help (or Wii you're willing to sell for cheap, lol) is appreciated.

UPDATE:  Called Nintendo Customer Service, but it was after hours, so I emailed them.  Still no response.  If I don't hear from them by the end of the week I'll probably just get another one off eBay.

I've checked the sensor bar and it's fine. Reset the remote cache and re-synched, and that helped a little with the cursor, but motion controls are still spotty.

1351024816.0	11ysdl	(x-post from r/streetfighter) Can I please get some help in picking a Street Fighter game from the Virtual Console?	JelloKing	7	0	4	"Allow me to get the most important details out of the way right off the bat. I live in North America, so I have seven options: Street Fighter II: The World Warrior on the SNES; Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting from the SNES; Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers from the SNES; Street Fighter Alpha 2 from the SNES; Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition from the Genesis (Mega Drive for my overseas friends); Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers from the Genesis/Mega Drive; and Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition from the TurboGrafx-16 (TurboGrafx-CD?).

Forgive the language for those of you who are easily offended, but when I was a kid, I owned a Genesis of my own and I loved the shit out of my copy of Champion Edition. I played it all the time (it would almost always be Vega, or Balrog to the Japanese) and it was the game that I was playing when the console, for a lack of a better word, died. I now own a copy of the Game Boy Advance version of Alpha 3, but it’s just not the same.

I know some of you might encourage me to buy the same game I had when I was a kid, but I always felt bad that I never played The New Challengers and thus never was able to really connect with Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, T. Hawk, and Akuma. But I thought I would bring this up in case any of those other games would provide a more enjoyable experience than Champion or Challengers. If this helps, I think the addition of the isms in Alpha 3 was trying to fix something that wasn’t broken. If you can’t help me in this way, maybe you can tell how the games differ? In that case, try to be as clear as you can please.

Brawl was the Wii's first dual layered DVD and it messed up lots of original Wii's... mine included.  My Wii no longer reads discs.

I've been reluctant to send away my Wii because I've got well over 200 dollars worth of VC titles on there and I play them regularly.  When I have friends over that's what we play.

I've recently bought a new Wii because it was cheap and I want to play my old games.  But also, now I'm thinking about repairing my old Wii but I have a problem.

I've inquired with Nintendo in the past about repairing my Wii.  They told me it would cost between 90 and 100 dollars and if they can't repair it they said they'd give me a new Wii and refund all my VC points which would let me redownload all my VC games.

But what are the chances of them being able to repair my Wii?  I kind of want my old Wii because it can play Gamecube games and the new Wii's cannot.

(http://vsrecommendedgames.wikia.com/wiki/Wii)

2D Platformer: Kirby's Epic Yarn. I found Kirby much more charming and lighthearted than New Super Mario Bros. The cute factor won me over + I'm a huge Kirby fan.

3D Platformer:  The only one I own is Super Mario Galaxy so that's my choice.

Action/Adventure: Metroid Other M.  It's not really as bad as other people say it is and I'm glad Team Ninja took a step away from the FPS aspect.  I recently ordered Skyward Sword however so this will probably change.

Action RPG: Rune Factory Frontier. I have yet to try my other action rpg, Tales of Symphonia, but Rune Factory is a fun game that will probably be my favorite for awhile.  I was a fan of Harvest Moon and this just improves upon it.

FPS: Goldeneye 007.  Unfortunately, I haven't played any other FPS game on the Wii (except Elebits) but Goldeneye is a solid title.

Hack N Slash: Sengoku Basara 3.  I love Dynasty Warriors style games and Sengoku Basara is even more over the top and ridiculous.

Beat em up: No more Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle.  Very fun game and satisfying to kill the enemies.  I get a bit bored of minigames though.

Fighting: Smash Bros. Brawl.  Honestly, I'm a bit unsure about putting Brawl in the same group of games as Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom.  Both are fighters, but Brawl feels so different.  Nevertheless, Brawl undoubtedly is my favorite in the fighting genre.  Tons of characters (I'm a nintendo fan.  This doubles the appeal), endless fun with friends, etc.

Light Gun: House of the Dead Overkill.  Zombies with an 80s feel to it?  Sounds like one hell of a ride.  I was playing this with my little cousins one day.  The black guy's dialogue made things a little awkward

Racing: Mario Kart Wii.  I've only played this about 3 times because I""m not a huge racing fan, but Mario Kart keeps things fun and interesting with powerups.

RPG: Arc Rise Fantasia.  Nothing very special about this game, but still a solid title.  It's just that there are not many turn based RPGs available on Wii to compete with.

I got Metroid Prime for Christmas after wanting to beat it again, but this time I have a problem. My Wii has played Metroid Prime Trilogy perfectly before, but now it is unable to read the disc. The disc is brand new so there is no problem there. I thought it might be the scanner since Metroid is a dual layer disc so I looked into ways of cleaning the scanner. I tried cleaning discs and other forms of cleaning products, but it still refuses to read it. The weird part is it can read other games like Zelda skyward sword perfectly. Also, after putting in a disc it clicks 3 times and then starts to run the game. This is very upsetting to me since I was looking forward to playing Metroid again since September and now I might have to buy a brand new Wii after having to replace a $80 game. What’s even worst is that the only reason I had to replace my old disc was because I thought it broken since the Wii couldn't read it. So now I am stuck with two Metroid Prime Trilogy discs, a bunch of cleaning supply, and a possibly broken Wii. If there is anything I can do please let me know!	t5_2qi9g	True

I have an older wii, from 2/3 years back.

Back then had updated to 4.1U, then softmodded and installed HBC + Bootmii (can't recall how because it was 2 years ago)

I had NeoGamma backup as channel, which worked fine, allowed me to play backups.

HBC was auto-updated to 1.0.8 during these times.

Recently decided to try out USB Loader GX (because it's convenient).  I ran it via HBC, have an external drive formatted to WBFS with backups loaded via WBFS Manager 3.0.1.  It worked fine.

My problem was I couldn't run some backups, so I assumed the issue was my being at 4.1U.

I did an official update, which brought the system up to 4.3U, HBC was still functioning, however USB Loader GX wasn't working correctly.  It would come up, display the backups, but when attemping to play it would bring me back to HBC.

I learned the official update overwrites/removes Bootmii and thought that was the problem, so I installed Bootmii both as boot2 and as an IOS (what's the difference?? can someone please explain??).  This didn't not fix it.

I googled ""4.3U USBLoader GX"" and it got me to a guide, followed it and did the following:

Used something called ""IOS236 Installer/ Uninstaller"" and picked the option ""Getting IOS36 revision 3351"" to install.

Then, used something called ""cIOS rev20b Installer"" to install ""IOS 236"" using the base IOS ""IOS56 v5661"" and ""IOS 249""

Then, used it again to install ""IOS 250"" using the base IOS ""IOS38 v4123"" and ""IOS 250"".

All the above from IOS file(s) that were on the SD card, provided with the guide along with the apps.

Using the above, USB Loader GX was functioning again, just as before, but those few backups still didn't work.

I even tried the CFG, but same issue, only those certain backup(s) don't work. (ie. RS2, Skyward.. I do have the necessary hardware)

So I'm at square one, I've installed things that I don't understand and I'm just hoping for some clarity.

What are IOSs? What did I install? Was it something bad for my Wii?

If I'm assuming that IOSs are just program(s), then is there a combination of IOSs that offer the best compatibility so that I can get almost all my backups to work?

What are these cIOSs by Hermes/Waninkoko? How do they have revisions? What does that mean?

What is d2x v7? Is that a cIOS?

I know it's alot to ask, but I'm very confused and any help/info would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance."	t5_2qi9g	True

My sister broke up with long-term boyfriend a few months ago, and got a wii recently, because she doesn't know what to do with her newfound free time.

So far, she likes the wii-sports and Fifa, but she asked me if there's any games she should play. I'm at least going to lend her:

* Metroid Prime Trilogy  
* Super Mario Galaxy 2

McJiggins	8	2	14	"It seems like the optical drive for my Wii no longer works properly--it doesn't read any of my games' discs and just returns an error message telling me to shut off my console and remove the game if I leave it spinning for long enough.  My warranty has obviously expired by now, and I'd normally just send it to Nintendo anyway, but the problem is that I've softmodded the console using Bannerbomb about two years ago and I know Nintendo's new policy towards hacked console repairs is either no fix or a heavy fine.  I've heard that self-repairs/replacements of the optical drive are doable and relatively simple, but I'm hesitant to really attempt something without an extensive guide.

So should I risk sending it off to Ninty, try repairing the thing myself, look for a local store, or just buy a new Wii (Wiis go for like $150 now, and the repair cost from Nintendo is around $100 anyway, so...)?

My Wii's system menu version is 3.1u, by the way.

Here is what I understood so far from several sources ([Guide 1](http://www.wiihacks.com/recommended-faqs-guides-tutorials-only/60921-guide-softmod-any-wii.html) and [Guide 2](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup)) and some questions to make it more clear for me.

* Use an exploit from an original game in order to run Hackmii Installer.
* Install HBC in order to be able to install homebrew applications.
* Install BootMii (What exactly does it do?)

At this point is my Wii considered softmodded? Can I play games from a harddisk with USB Loader?
Chapter 2 from the first link(Guide 1) also suggests installing a modpack, cios/ios and wad files.
What exactly are those?
Are they needed?
If not what are the advantages of having them?

JuddRunner	8	2	14	"So I tried to fire up our Wii last night and the drive rejects discs (Wii and GC) after a few sputters and grinds. I'm going to assume that my kids probably inserted a disc too forcefully when I wasn't supervising. 
I live in Boise, ID which is large enough that there's a couple of indie repair shops that (I assume) specialize in this sort of thing, and I'm not very technically inclined.

1359509102.0	17j6he	What were the best surprises and biggest disappointments for you?	Cr1m	10	4	47	"Now that the wii is just about finished, let's talk about what surprised us, good and bad.

The Good: Dead Space Extraction and Sengoku Basara.  I was never really into rail shooters but Dead Space surprised me.  It was very fun with neat weapons, lots of interesting areas to fight monsters, and was pretty creepy with the lights off.  I played with a friend and we loved the flamethrower in that game.  Next, hack &amp; slashes have always been something like a guilty pleasure of mine and Sengoku Basara was great.  I laughed at the ridiculousness at some parts, and the game didn't feel too limited by the Wii's hardware, but I was a bit sad that not all the characters could be played.  It played great with CCP or Wiimote and was good for hours of fun.

The Bad: I'll be honest guys.  I did not like Mario Galaxy, Skyward Sword, or Xenoblade Chronicles.  I discovered recently that I am a bigger fan of 2D or 2D/3D platformers.  I liked Super Paper Mario and my favorite Zelda games are Link to the Past and Oracle of Ages.  That is most likely why I didn't like Galaxy and Skyward.  In addition, I am not a fan of motion controls, and found them annoying to use in said games.  Finally, Xenoblade's gameplay was boring to me.  I followed Operation Rainfall and made a post about it at one point to help garner attention for Pandora and Last Story, and the day I got Xenoblade, I immediately popped it in and started playing.  I like the characters, the plot, the giant expansive world, and the art, but I found myself bored of completing sidequests involving finding monsters and mashing my skills.  I think I prefer RPGs where I control all the characters, and not designate a leader.  I may try it again though. Who knows.

So that's it from me.  How about the rest of you?"	t5_2qi9g	True

I have one of the earliest models, which are prone to drive laser wear from dual-layer discs like Super Smash Bros Brawl. It was sent in to Nintendo, who found traces of homebrew, and replied in an email with something along the lines of:

""Installing homebrew permanently damages the system, there is nothing we can do so we are sending it back.""

Which is BS (they could just wipe the system), but it's their call. I'm looking into other repair options, this is the only website I have found so far that does it (only from page 1 of Google's results):

They also have the parts and a tutorial to DIY, is that advisable? Is it difficult to work with the Wii? I have experience with taking apart electronics, so I'm not afraid to get down and dirty, just wondering if I'm in over my head and better off getting a professional to do it. Thank you.

Additionally, I should mention that my Wii simply does not recognize any disc at all (it's not just Super Smash Bros Brawl).

I tried turning the Wii on and off, inserting other games, turning the Wii on it's side and back to vertical again, blowing into the disc thingy to clean it, and leaving it off for about half an hour, but nothing works and I keep getting that dumb error message. I am so frustrated at the moment.

I followed [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/19/how-to-play-xenoblade-chronicles-if-you-live-in-america/) &amp; GAF's guide to installing the homebrew channel, ios236 v6, and then d2x. I don't have the game yet to test if everything works. 

I letterbombed, and didn't install BootMii to boot2 or IOS. Skipped it and only took homebrew channel.

I am probably not going to install Xenoblade on a USB hard drive even though I went and installed the CFG USB Loader app, and will run it off the PAL Disc. Should it show up like a normal NTSC game in the disc channel or will I need to launch it differently somehow? That part was vague. Is the region lock just gone and does it force boot?


Also, backtracking a bit on it... 

I'm not sure if IOS 236_v6 step installed right due to the 'pirate' question...I'm not sure what button I hit there. I assumed it was and went ahead with the d2x install.

I assume it's safe for me to double check that and just run/install IOS236 Installer_v6 again after d2x and USB CFG is all ready to go? Is running and reading a syscheck through homebrew channel able to tell me for sure if IOS236 was patched right? ... Would it say anything there if I missed that step?


I just want to be able to throw the disc in and have it load up properly when I get it. Can someone explain how to launch it properly?


Edit: I haven't slept in 2 days and I'm overdosing on caffeine, I'm paranoid about bricking, and probably seem like a trainwreck at explaining things here."	t5_2qi9g	True
1315774811.0	kcd53	Diagnosis and fix	Jimbiscuits	6	1	4	"Hey r/wii!

It's been a very long time since I've even touched my wii, in terms of modding and the like. 

A few months ago I updated my wii via the official updater, while having homebrew and etc. on my wii. Obviously this didn't go down well. Fast forward a few months forward: I used the EU Smash Stack exploit to try and get everything up and running again. 

Later on, as I tried to install wads using wadmanager, I got a message telling me that my wii could be semi-bricked and that the wad couldn't be installed. 

So I can't access any official updates or the shop channel, and I can't run homebrew properly. A few years back and once or twice between then and now, I've installed and probably messed with so much, that I can't give a history of what my wii has been through.

I was wondering if there is any diagnostic tool I could run that would help one of you kind people suggest ways to either get my wii running homebrew/softmod as it *should* run, or even to just make my wii a virgin once more.

Thank youu. :)

I'm new regarding modding Wii, but I'm learning so bare with me :-)

I have a Wii version 4.3E that I hacked with Letterbomb last night.

This went well and I now have BootMii installed as an IOS (I think that's correct, I couldn't install it as boot2) and I also have the Homebrew Channel installed (version 1.0.8).

When I start HBC I also got these version numbers: *IOS58 v24.32*

**So what's next?**

I have read that installing PriiLoader will get me an extra protection against bricking since my BootMii only could be installed as IOS. Is this correct?

**Is PriiLoader compatible with Letterbomb and with my Wii?**

If PriiLoader should/will be installed whats next after that?

Some custom IOS'es and a USB loader to run glorious backup games?

I suspect overheating, but I'm not sure what else I can do to keep it from doing so.  It is not in a cabinet, I dust it out every couple of weeks or so, and it is not even warm to the touch, probably due to it using the usb port as opposed to the disc drive.

I'm looking for a good one player game similar to some older school games I've played before.  To give you an idea, the two games I'm most nostalgic for are Pilotwings 64 and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, also for the N64.  In both I really enjoyed the fact that there were missions that required practice and each one developed more skill, I particularly liked in Rainbow Six how you would control 3-4 soldiers by programming them one at a time.  

I've played 2 first person shooters on our Wii, goldeneye (which was a bit too hectic for me, I felt more like I was going with their flow than coming up with my own ideas) and Manhunt 2 (which was just boring).  Open to any and all suggestions.

In January of 2008 I bought a Wii from a friend of mine and have had no issues with it until recently.  I was playing Poképark 2 the other day and I went to start the game, it began loading, and then the screen stayed dark.  I was able to hit the Home button and try reloading.  I got through various stages of the game loading, even the game had started but when I loaded a new area, it went dark.  Then the system wouldn't even send an image to the screen.  I thought it was the cables, but I tried sending it through my DVD player and it works fine (though I'm not convinced the TV input *isn't* shot).  I tried loading the game, but the same thing happened.  I then decided to reformat.  I saved all of my channels and files to an SD and attempted to reformat.  Nothing happened for about 15 minutes.  I pulled the power cord out (I know I'm not *supposed* to do that, but nothing was happening).

1329351357.0	pri1h	Going to be updating my modded Wii in a few days. 	simpat1zq	6	1	20	"I modded my Wii a long time ago(More than a year and half, I think). I have a 500GB hard drive on it. I haven't touched the Wii, or read anything regarding the Wii in over a year, and as I'm sure you all know, a LOT has changed in that time, and what little I remember from doing it the first time won't help a whole lot this time. 

I have some questions before I get started:

1) I read in another post that it's recommended that I use FAT32 instead of WBFS. Can someone explain to me why that is? Also, to convert it, should I just use [wbfs2fat.py](http://www.wiihacks.com/content/425-wbfs2fat-py-wbfs-fat32-conversion.html)? Is it really that easy?

2) In order to get everything updated and where it needs to be to play most newer (and older) games, should I just use ModMii(I wish I had that when I did this the first time)? Will ModMii be OK to use, even if my Wii is already modded? Is there anything else I need to do in addition to ModMii?

3) Will a 512MB SD card be good enough? Most of the cards I have are SDHC, and I'm reading that SDHC won't work well. 

4) The main reason I'm wanting to set the Wii back up is that I just found out that it can play movies off a share(SMB) on the network. Does that work well? And WiiMC the hands down way to go? From what I read, it is. 

5) Is there any way to load games to the Wii over the network, so I don't have to move the hard drive around?

6) When I last used the Wii, I remember that the best loader IMO was USB Loader GX. Is that still the case, or are there other better loaders now?

7) Is there anything else I need to look out for with what I'm trying to do?

EDIT: 8) About CIOS'es. Is there a 'best' cIOS that works with everything now, or do we still have to load a bunch on there, and just try them out? Is there a website that has a list of all the games, and which cIOS you need to use?"	t5_2qi9g	True

The situation is that there's a TV downstairs from me in the common room which already has a Wii. Of course I'd rather use my Wii so I can use my American games and access my saved games.

Would I be able to just bring my Wii and plug it into the power and TV using the cables already there? I'm most worried there might be a power mismatch, i.e., whether it's okay to plug a UK Wii power adapter (plugged into a UK power outlet) into a US Wii. I'm assuming the TV cables and the Wiimotes will work just fine."	t5_2qi9g	True

To start, I have Cerebral Palsy. I have pretty much normal use of my left hand, but my right hand is very limited in what it can do. My family has a Wii and we all enjoy playing it, but there are some games that are off limits to me because you need to be able to use the wii remote and nunchuck at the same time. For some games I am able to use the classic controller (mainly Mario Kart, I am able to grasp and press the A button well enough), but my main goal in this is that I would love to be able to play Skyward Sword.


In the past I have been able to ""hop"" between the two remotes, but when a game starts getting intense, I am SOL. I've looked at modifications online, but none would meet my one controller idea. I think there should be a way to kind of add the joystick and the C and Z buttons to the remote.


Just to explain how desperate I am, I have considered taping the nunchuck to the remote. Help a girl out!


**TL;DR: Is there a way the nunchuck and wii remote could be combined?**

She's not really a gamer but appreciates playing stuff like bubble shooters, puzzlers, Sims and various social games on her mobile. She was totally crazy about Plants vs Zombies and finished it. I don't think neither of us is that much in to neither family party games, singing or first person shooters.

1321405823.0	mdser	Awesome SNEEK mod: NEEK2O	zfa	8	3	8	"Just in case any of you guys haven't heard, overjoy and obcd (others?) released their 'custom' DI build of NEEK last week, called [NEEK2O](http://gbatemp.net/topic/313314-neek2o/). The most notable improvements over old-skool NEEK are:

- no need to hijack the sd:/bootmii/armboot.bin binary to launch NEEK any more (so bootmii and NEEK can co-exist).
- supports the direct launching of games in the WBFS format instead of the FST (Disc-Ex rips) format. Yay!!

If you set up a NEEK2O environment then I also recommend switching from the normal system menu (and ugly NEEK overlay menu) to [postloader3](http://gbatemp.net/topic/299384-postloader2/) (by stfour). You can set it to autoboot via priiloader in NEEK NAND so you need never see the stock system menu. This will give you a single launcher to kick off all your wiiware/VC (pretty much perfect compatibility), homebrew and WBFS games. It also supports the usual cover downloads, hiding and sorting of menu items, filtering of the displayed titles by VC system type etc.

[ModMii 4.7.6](http://gbatemp.net/t207126-modmii-for-windows) includes the NEEK2O mods when building SNEEK/UNEEK environments for those that don't want to use SNEEK Installer. PL3 is a simple download to SD card.


Finally, and kinda-sorta related, a lot of the cIOS loaders (WiiFlow, USB Loader GX) now support the use of an emulated NAND for saved games and DLC (under d2x v7 betas). Point these to your NEEK2O NAND to get all your data in one 'external' NAND and remove Wii system memory limits for saved games etc. Brilliant!

I realized I was having trouble getting the ore because I neglected to read that it was in Area 4; instead I was searching 5 &gt;_&lt; .

Super Metroid is bound to be my kind of game, but I'm not sure how hard it's going to be, so that might be frustrating.  
Zelda is sure to be fun and nostalgia-inducing, but I'll probably finish it in two days.

I wrote up my initial impressions thinking I was about halfway through the game and then the last three levels of the game just seemed to get shorter and shorter and then it was done. 

I was then surprised to see that there was very little in the way of post game content either. Challenge Mode is a bit of a misnomer considering it's just a score challenge replay of the game, a game that respawns all the money giving crates and barrels every time you re enter an area.

It feels like this game was pinched in development. I was sure that there was going to be find all the sheriff stars/tokens type achievements and there's a few things in the game that feel like they we're going to be more substantial. The keycard thing you use to open doors seems like it was meant to be more than just a door key and on the third level (I think) you can hear crying from a well and whispers behind doors of the supposedly wiped out village. Thought that this might be mentioned in the ""story"" but nothing comes to pass.

Anybody know if this game was seriously scaled back? I found some stuff about Ubi scaling back the challenge mode but nothing else about a protracted or curtailed development. 

I for one am quite chuffed that the game is cut and dry done after the initial credits- I'm a sucker for extra content and feel compelled to 100% a game it nice but rare to just be done done with a game.

I have seen others with this issue but nothing I've seen recommended fixes my issue. I tried moving the ROMs from external HDD to SD card, I've tried both the classic controller and the regular wii controller, etc. Some have said the type of video connection used makes a difference (I am using composite cables) or changing the video output mode might help (my Wii is outputting 480i to my HD plasma screen; incidently the 480p otion is greyed out so I can't even try that) but regular Wii games play just fine without any lag - shouldn't ALL games have lag if this were the issue?

Commancer	5	2	3	"At one point in my life, I put my Wii upside down  (gravity would push chips away from the motherboard) under my bed with WC24 off and used it as a nice USB power hub for my Zune charging cable, but after I wanted to mod it, I tried actually using it, and it would **very rarely** boot past the health and warning screen.  Eventually I got to the Wii menu, installed homebrew, reinstalled v4.1 firmware, and had fun Wiibrew time.

It worked fine for a year, and did everything with no artifacts even on a 56"" TV, but that TV is gone, and after using it on a nice tube TV for a while, I'm using an LED TV, and noticed artifacts while playing Wii games.  I bought component cables to see if the issue was the old cables, but the artifacts are still here, and got a little worse.

I think the Wii also used lead-free solder on a BGA package, so it's susceptible to the problems the 360 and PS3 get, and I'm thinking that a reheat of the solder might fix it.  Has anyone else done it?

I know what is causing it, a small metal arm that holds the disc down has had it's tension weakened from having a disc inside the console most of the time. Since the tension has weakened, the arm vibrates and causes the buzzing sound.

I've seen a good few videos on how to fix it from removing the arm and bending it back to add more tension to the less risky choice of merely loosening the screws holding down the arm by just enough to stop the sound.

We have had 2 corrupt save game files already.  The game freezes, once it was during a save, we were in yr4 having a grand old time. The second time I did not notice a save in progress.  The wii has froze a couple of times with this game but only the last 2 really caused any stress.

The only thing I came up with is to make periodic backups of the save game to the SD storage in case of another wii freak-out. 

Could this be caused by the disk (seemes unlikley to me).  Bad memory on the wii (I have no issues with other games at all). Or just a FU from Warner Bros. Entertainment to me?

Thought some of you might be interested in a Mario Kart Wii mod I put together over the last few months. [Mario Kart Black](http://wiitdb.com/Game/CKBE88) is what I ended up calling it (got the idea from [artwork I saw on dA](http://latchful-puppet.deviantart.com/art/Mario-Kart-Black-85195430)). I decided to stick with texture modding (simple graphic swaps) as opposed to customized courses because I wanted people to still be able to play it online. It utilizes the same save file as the original game, so you can keep playing with your original license instead of having to start over. It includes:

* Custom Strap/ESRB Warning &amp; recoloured user interface
* 32 Texture hacked courses with multiplayer support
* 32 Custom track songs &amp; SFX music edits
* 1 customized battle course
* Many customized characters/vehicles
* Other various text substitutions (course names, race countdown, credits etc.)

If you're interested, [here's a preview video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svt3PALxnvQ) demoing what the game looks like. I also have [a](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1YaBwLJyps) [few](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp5EQsOkejU) [examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24dOkYVsDbg) [of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByHvAVnyfTI) [the](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCOV5i8525o) [texture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIAB1MzSykw) [hacks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv8B2BC-SGs) if you'd like to see what those look like.

If you'd like to try the mod, the files can be downloaded [here](http://www.wiiso.com/mario-kart-black-t119766.html) although you may have to register. The game is also available on tehparadox (hippyfreak's thread). It should work on any modded Wii, or using the Riivolution patch on any unmodded Wii.

I've had homebrew installed on my wii, and aside from running some hacks for brawl that was it, I didn't install anything besides the homebrew channel and gecko to load the codes. 
I've been playing a lot of monster hunter tri (it updated the wii when I first tried to play it, and everything still worked fine after that), and then one day my wii stops working.
The power light is red, pressing power does nothing. I switch the AC adapter with my roommate's adapter, now the Wii turns on and i can eject the disc, but there's no screen that tells me to sync my wiimote or sounds or anything, so blank screen.
I don't want to buy a new AC adapter just to find out I have to buy a completely new Wii, so, please, if you guys have any idea on what to do, let me know.
I've seen online a few people with broken Wii's who bring it to some ""wii repair dude"" who then fixes it, and if anyone knows of such a dude in central jersey, let me know. As long as it's not done in some dark alley in Newark I'll be very grateful. Thanks!"	t5_2qi9g	True

1374526156.0	1iu5z1	Best charging station/base for Wii/Wii U [x-post from /r/wiiu	faortiz	8	7	2	"So after buying some Wii U Pro controllers, I realized that my Wii remotes don't have rechargeable battery packs or anything of the sort. I have 4 Wii remotes and they get used just as much as my Pro controllers (for Wii mode primarily, and to use the Classic Controllers for both Wii and Wii U). 

I regrettably bought the Nyko charge base ([here's a link to one](http://www.wiishopexpress.com/Wii-Quad-Charge-Station-charges-4-remotes-p/WA87060.htm?gclid=CKOQ1az0w7gCFVNo7AodmQsAaQ])). I have two problems with this charging station.

1. In order to place my controllers to charge, I have to remove the sleeve for the controllers to fit. This is an issue for a lot of different kinds of chargers so this alone would not be a deal breaker for me.
1. The controllers even without the sleeve don't fit properly and I have to eventually swap the controllers to charge which defeats the purpose of having 4 slots. I think they don't fit because of the wrist strap that connects the controllers at the bottom.

Anyway, I was wondering what charging stations other people used. I bought this station instead of a regular 8 pack of rechargeable Energizer or Duracell batteries thinking it would be annoying to remove the batteries but now I wish had at least done that instead so that I could use those batteries elsewhere. Does anyone have the same station as me and not have any problems? I had my eyes on bases like [this one](http://www.energizer.com/portable-power/gaming/charging/Pages/wireless-charging-system-for-wii-controllers.aspx) since you don't have to remove anything but I'm afraid the battery life isn't very good and I don't know if they sell another two pack rechargeable battery set without the base so that I have all 4 of my remotes. 

I don't care if the base isn't big enough for 4 controllers. I also don't care if the remotes are stored away nice and neatly because I have a basket already filled with all of my Wii U accessories that works nicely. I'm just looking for an efficient way to charge my Wii remotes.

1374420352.0	1ir4fz	Not reading games?	threethirds	5	4	1	"Not too long ago I went to play  Golden Eye which had been sitting in my Wii for a couple weeks since the last time I'd played it.  One of my favorite things about the Wii is being able to download oldschool games and play Netflix and that's what I'd been using it as during that time.  
When I went to click on the disc-drive icon, it wasn't reading as a CD in the bay.  I tried to hit eject and it seemed like it was trying to eject but the 'lift/arm' wasn't catching the CD itself.  Inserting something thin--like the clip on a pen cap--and pressing down the CD after hitting eject again, it caught and spit the CD out.  Now, when I try to insert *any* CD, it recognizes something's been put in but has trouble catching it and pulling it the rest of the way in.  Pushing it in the rest of the way is easy and, the first couple times, worked and it was readable.  

Recently, though, it's stopped reading altogether.  It still recognizes a CD is being inserted, it still recognizes a CD is in there, and it still tries to eject (and all the DLC still works as does internet and Netflix) but it consistently states the CD/game is unreadable, this goes for any game inserted (the CDs themselves are clean/no scratches.  The Wii itself has suffered no blows or drops :/

I saw a couple videos and How-To's online to fix this sort of issue and just ordered a triangluar screwdriver to attempt to fix this.  I just ordered a PS3 as well so if the Wii craps out, it's not a *total* lost but I still really like it and enjoy playing Majora's Mask, Gunstar Heroes, Smash Brothers, the Mario's and Mario Kart, and ChronoTrigger, so *those* would sadly be lost if the thing breaks further but I thought I'd post here to see if anyone's experienced anything similar or had any ideas or tips to rectifying this problem

Thanks in advance!

So, the bundle offer I bought had a Wii console, power, sensor, 2 controllers, a nunchuck controller, a set of sports accessories (without the game, strangely) and 2 games (Legend of the Guardians &amp; Mario Kart).

My questions:

- What are the first game(s) to buy to see the controller's capabilities? (Sports Resort? Any other?)
- Best game to buy for my kid (4 y.o).
- Best game to buy that my (non-gaming) wifey can get involved in.
- A game that pushes the Wii's graphical limits to the max.

Any other suggestions? Next Step? Next accessory? Do I unlock/hack it now or wait some time to enjoy the virgin experience? Thanks a lot guys."	t5_2qi9g	True
1367571321.0	1dlyn4	Super Mario 64 Multiplayer	t_r_a_p	9	7	2	"hey reddit wondering if anyone can answer this.

I recently started messing around with sm64 multiplayer and I cant seem to get it to work right.  I tried running it on the wii64 emu; it works fine until you try to enter the first world.  Music keeps playing, but the picture freezes.  I'm able to hit the reset button and return to the wii64 menu, but it will just do the same thing.  I understand that it works great on the emulator that comes with the sm64 multplayer download, but I am on a mac and I cant for life of me figure out sixtyforce controller layout.  Using Darwiin to get sixtyforce to work is all one big headache for me, and Id rather not deal with it.  I guess what Im wondering is there any other emulator on the homebrew channel that will run the game OR how do I get a patched wad to play.  can you patch a wad???  if so can someone steer me in the right direction because that would be my preferred method; running it from a wad on the wii.

thanks for any help; let me know if i need to give more info, or if i wasnt thorough enough.  again thanks reddit   "	t5_2qi9g	True

1365805587.0	1c8ibi	Virtual Console Mode not Supported Fix?	Crasher_TL	4	1	7	"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

So I grabbed a Wii off TradeMe (NZ version of eBay), and it came with Pokemon Puzzle League loaded onto the Wii. I used my component cables to connect the Wii to my NTSC TV, changed the Screen Mode to 480p, and it works! Instead of being black and white, it's in colour. So, I decided to try out Puzzle League, as I'd never heard of it before, and the console came with a Classic Controller.

So after a while, the TV showed the ""Mode not Supported"" message. After looking around a bit, I found the temporary fix which you must press Z + A + 2 to activate the Component Cable Interlace Mode. It didn't work.

So, basically I have a PAL Wii which will play games on my NTSC HDTV, but will not play any Virtual Console games. While it's not that much of a deal, I wanted the Wii for both GC compatibility and also for the Virtual Console.

So, is there any fix that doesn't involve softmodding the Wii? So far I have done the following:

* Tried different settings (480p and 480i, still does not work)
* Tried Composite Cables (tried the ones that it came with, just made the Wii black and white. It worked though, but I didn't really want to play it without colour and incredibly grainy)
* Tried a different TV. I have a small tube TV which only has one speaker. I tried the Wii on that, and it works, but it's pretty small.

So, is there anything I can do?"	t5_2qi9g	True

A few years ago, it wouldn't update past the 4.3U*** version where it still sits today.  I gave it over 6 hours and then tried again a few times and it always stalls at the same spot in the progress bar.  I just gave up on updating since everything else seemed to work until Skyward Sword came out and I couldn't play it without an update.  I bought a new Wii because I am impatient.

Anyway, I have a ton of virtual console purchases on it and money in the wii store.  I want to transfer the data to my Wii U.  However, even though I downloaded the transfer utility on my good wii onto an SD card, it won't let me run it on the bad wii without it updating to a newer version.  So, I can't get my data off of it.. especially game saves like for Monster Hunter Tri that you can't copy no matter what.

I have tried using wireless and wired connections to update the Wii.  I have tried using different networks.  I have taken it to other houses and to work to try those networks.  It won't update and it sticks in the same spot every time.  I have tried many times over several years to update it, so it's not DNS or a transient networking issue or wireless problems or any sort of temporary issue.

I even let it sit for over a week and it didn't complete the update or get any errors.

The hard drive is not full.

Everything else functioned fine on the wii until just recently where now I have to turn it off and then back on anywhere from 3 to 20 times before anything other than a black screen comes up.

Since I've owned it, there have always been extra colorful artifacts on the screen like static.  I only notice this during some parts of gameplay and just pretty much ignored it.


I'm about to just give up and ship it to Nintendo, but I'm scared they will either lose all my data on the Wii or ship me a newer Wii without the Gamecube compatibility.  I don't want to lose my 300hour+ Monster Hunter Tri game save or my virtual console purchases.

Googling has not yielded anything useful for me.  I'm hoping someone else here can help me.

This weekend, I got new HD cable boxes.  TV resolution changed (I assume is the issue), and now when I go to the input for my Wii, I have audio, but no video.  I borrowed my neighbor's composite cable, same issue.  I took the whole rig to my 720p Westinghouse TV upstairs, and it works fine.  

I can't get the TV to convert back to the SD resolution, and I can't get the Wii to go into HD mode.  Here are my questions:

1) does this sound like a logical problem, or have I overlooked something?

2) is there a way to change the resolution, either on the TV or the Wii, without purchasing a Wii Component cable first?

3) Does it sound like getting a component cable for my Wii could solve the problem?  (I am recently separated, and can't afford to waste even a couple dollars ATM)

Anyone have any thoughts or ideas?  Any experience with these issues?

**UPDATE**: Well, it appears that when my TV re-adjusted for the HD signal, it became the display format for ALL inputs.  That meant that my Y/R/W cable was about as good as a dead man's erection: it could do something, but would never realize it.

I purchased an R/G/B/R/W Wii Component cable (yay monoprice) and everything was golden.  Well, ok, not GOLDEN, as it was B&amp;W until I changed the resolution on the Wii itself, and then it was full color, which INCLUDED gold, but was hardly the primary...
