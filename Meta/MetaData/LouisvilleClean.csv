1370318043.0	1fmph4	Can you help me find my brother?		220	36	85	"His name is Gregory Paul Staudinger. My brother left his wallet and car at his apartment. This is abnormal for him. Here are some photos: http://imgur.com/a/6fyDM
He lives in Louisville, Kentucky. He works at Starbucks. Last time seen was in his apartment, his room was locked and wanted to be alone at around 2:30pm June 2.
He had plans to go to Chicago on Monday June 3.

For a great deal, Please come check out my restaurant, Lil Cheezers.  938 Baxter Ave.  (Deal in Comments)"	FoodPerson	161	27	86	"I have been a member of Reddit personally for about 5 years.  (new user name obv.) I started the restaurant after having a food truck that I've had going the past couple years.  The truck was pretty successful  so I decided to have a centralized place to prep, store, and clean the truck.  The restaurant is a small spot, but cozy, and a nice front porch in a great location.  (middle of highlands)  
I know there aren't many Louisville Redditors, but I'd like to offer a deal to all of you guys.  Come in and tell them you saw an ad on Reddit and we will take 50% off your bill until the end of the year.  We sell beer too, btw. 
If you have been to the restaurant, I am new to the whole food scene, so if you have any suggestions please let me know!  
If you can't make it by then, I'm sure I will have some other kind of deal in 2013.  I'd like to sponsor the next r/Louisville meet-up too if I could.  
Thanks for reading, hope to see you guys soon!"	t5_2qqvg	True

I am a student in Iowa, and was asked to do a home-office interview for a company in Louisville.  Since there was no direct flight, I had a connection in Chicago.  Well, I get to Chicago the night before my interview, and after my plane gets delayed for 4 hours, it gets canceled.  I am super frustrated because this was a company I really wanted to work for and didn't want to miss my interview.  So I am waiting in line at the airport to figure out what my options are.  
  
I start to make small talk with the guy in line next to me, and find out he is an alumni from the university I attend, and actually works at the company I was going to interview for.  He coincidentally was visiting family in Chicago at the time.  Well, we figure out that we can't get on any other flights that night, and it's about 12am.  So I'm making phone calls trying to get ahold of people, when he comes up and says to me ""Hey I can just rent a car and drive us both back to Louisville so you can get to your interview.""  
  
So that's what we did.  We left around 1am and drove for 5 hours to get to Kentucky.  He drove the whole way so I could try to get some sleep since we were going to be cutting close on time.  I had to be at the company by 7:30am... and we arrived at 6:30, so I showered super fast at my hotel that I saw for but 10 minutes, put on my suit, and made it on time :)  I ended up getting an offer and will be returning to Louisville this summer!  
  
Yay for coincidences and kind people.  Looking forward to this summer :)"	t5_2qqvg	True

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hum7u/look_what_i_found_on_my_neighbors_car_id_love_for/

...we would like to put together a reddit get-together in Louisville!

We are thinking CHEROKEE park... my thought is we do a bring your own food to bbq kind of thing.  

Do weekends work best for everyone?

EDIT: Leave a comment in this post and we'll send you a message when we have a more firm date.

EDIT 2: Looks like Global Meetup day would be the best day to do this.  That's June 25th, and is a Saturday.  We thinking a little before dinner time so we have some time to grill the food? Like meet up around 4pm?

EDIT 3: The event has been added to redditgifts.com's meetup section! http://redditgifts.com/meetups/louisville-cookout-global-meetup-day/

EDIT 4: Looks like more and more people are saying Cherokee park since it is closer to the center of Louisville.  So hopefully this doesn't cause too much confusion, but it is going to be at CHEROKEE PARK now.

EDIT 5: A few people have made comments about where in Cherokee park to meet. It looks like the consensus is to meet at Hogan's Fountain...

First of all, their names are already widely available on reddit, youtube, and various other sites across the internet. A Google search yielded almost 600,000 results. The ban on ""personal information"" as I understand it, deals more with posting things and links to things that are not already widely available or commonly known. As I see it, it is the difference between posting a business' publicly listed phone number and posting the manager's unlisted cell phone number. I did not remove it for the sole purpose of hiding their names.

I did not remove it because there are other posts about the same topic. Three posts over the course of a week on a hot button issue is not uncommon or excessive, in my opinion. How many times a month do users post ""any jobs?"" How many ""where to eat/shop/drink/go?"" posts go up every month? We're not a travel guide, but we don't yell ""SPAM!"" at these posts, and no one even points out that all of this has been rehashed in the sidebar as well. My point is that multiple posts on similar topics isn't always a bad thing. If we're going to quote the redditquette, we should notice that the redditquette also says: ""Don't complain about too many stories or images on a particular topic.""

Now that I have outlined why it was not removed, I will address the reason for its removal. It incited inflammatory action against the two. It said ""feel free to spread this around."" While I don't find it to have violated the ""personal information"" or ""spam"" sections of the redditquette, I do find it to have violated the *reasoning* behind the ""personal information"" section. It addresses ""witch hunts and vigilantism"" directly, and that is how that post read to me, so I removed it. The intent of the post was clearly to call these two out and challenge the community to take an action. That is not what we are here for. Posts on Urban Outfitters vs. Highland Coffee by me never called for any action from anyone. I didn't even participate in the discussion because I did not want to incite any action with my opinions. Posts about Grasshoppers CSA do not encourage others not to buy from them. They merely point out that user's experience and/or opinion. This post about the ""rapists"" crossed the line between ""call to attention"" and ""call to action"". That is why it was removed.

If you made it this far, thank you for sticking with me. TL;DR: ""rapists"" post was removed, and I had my reasons."	t5_2qqvg	True
1340378658.0	vfsso	Do not rent from Willowbrook  apartments	wanderer91	54	8	34	"I live at the willow brook apartments at 2106 buechel bank rd, in Buechel.  Although they appeared to be decent apartments at first, after living here for 9 months of our twelve month lease, we just can't wait to leave.  Putting aside the faulty electrical wiring (which has caused the building across the street to burn down), the abysmal ""24 hour"" maintenance (a work order to fix a nonworking dishwasher wasn't answered for nearly six months, and it is still broken), and the general hostility towards the residents; the final straw has been a large patch of black mold, caused by water leaking through the walls, which has been happily thriving in our closet for well over a month now.  We told the apartment manager about the mold, and a maintenance worker came and fixed the water, but left the black mold.  Assuming that a fix was forthcoming, but having nowhere else to stay, my fiancee and I slept on a mattress in the living room, as far from the mold as possible.  After about 8 days without hearing from anyone, we called the Louisville dept of health.  An inspector came out, and confirmed the presence of black mold, as well as numerous other code violations (mainly electrical.). Armed with an official opinion, we confronted the apartment manager, who informed us ( very rudely) that no one would be coming to remove the mold until we had moved the various objects the had formerly been in the closet, and now lay strewn about the limited floor space of the bedroom, as we did not want anything we valued to be exposed to the mold.  Against our better judgment, we ventured into the room we had up until now been avoiding, and removed everything except the furniture,preferring the short term exposure to the fungus to living with it for the remainder of our lease.  We were told that maintenance would be by the next day to remove the mold.  That was almost a week ago, and we have heard nothing from anyone at the apartment. An attempt to contact the owners of the complex has proved fruitless, as the information about Willow brook available online is only slightly more than nothing.  I am sick, my fiancee is sick, and my roommate is sick.  We have worked hard to pay our rent here, and all we wanted in return was a safe place to live, but we have repeatedly been denied even that. I doubt that I will see anything happen about this, but I can at least try to get the word out so that no one else will have their lives thrown into upheaval because of this company.

Thank you for your time."	t5_2qqvg	True

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). I appreciate hearing from you on this important matter.

 

As you know, SOPA would give the U.S. Department of Justice and intellectual property owners new tools to combat illegal music, movie, and product sales on the Internet. While I certainly support the goal of protecting intellectual property and preventing the trafficking of counterfeit goods, I share your concerns that H.R. 3261 is an overly-broad tool that may result in the removal of non-infringing content from the Internet, in contravention of the First Amendment.

 

H.R. 3261 is currently pending consideration in the House Judiciary Committee, which recently held a hearing on the legislation. However, a bipartisan group of legislators is working on an alternative approach to protecting intellectual property online. While I do not serve on a committee with jurisdiction over this issue, you may be assured that I will keep your views close in mind should SOPA or another bill on this matter come to the House Floor for a vote.

 

In the meantime, please feel free to get in touch with me regarding any matter of concern. Thank you again for contacting me – and if you would like to learn more about my work in Washington and in Louisville, please visit my website at www.yarmuth.house.gov where you will find the latest news, my weekly schedule, video from hearings, and information about constituent services.  You can also sign up for my e-newsletter to receive periodic updates on important issues and services for your family.

Coming back every night from UPS from 4:30-7 it wasn't uncommon for me to be followed home by a cop every night.  Never stopped me, never actually pulled me over.  Just followed me.  Whatever though, seems like a waste of police time/gas/etc after they follow me enough to be able to tell that I haven't been drinking.  

Anyways, two weeks ago I come home, I'm followed briefly and then he slows down.  I pull onto my street and park and a police car speeds around the corner and pulls in front of me.  Within a few seconds, a second car parks behind me.  Lights shining, 4 cops step out.  As the officer approaches my car, and I'm putting my window down, before I even get it down he tells me I smell like alcohol.  Asks if I've been drinking.  Two cops stay behind and talk to me while he checks my license and registration.  I figure I did okay during their verbal test so they didn't bother taking out the breathalyzer.  I've been pulled over a total of **THREE** times for the same shit.  Same questions, same 'alcohol' smell.  They admitted having no reason to pull me over, but that they can pull anyone over for no reason because of a ""New Albany Police Traffic Initiative"".  In other words, a way to pull I-64 detour goers over for no reason and hope to find something they can ticket.

The real reason I'm writing this is because of what happened tonight.  My fiance was took my son to pick up a prescription.  He has been getting over pneumonia.  She was pulled over for no reason, gave her the same questions except the searched the call.  Completely fucking tore it apart and left the shit on the ground when they were done and pulled away.  Searched my fiance, made my son get out of the car and sit outside with pneumonia while they conducted a search with no real reason.  They let her go, no ticket, but she was upset about it.  
Maybe I'm more pissed than I should be but to be pulled over 3 times for no reason, then my fiance pulled over for the same shit.  Searching the car, making my son with pneumonia sit in the cold all to end in no tickets and no reasons.  It's infuriating.  I've flooded http://www.cityofnewalbany.com/citizens-action-center/ with countless emails, only to get back generic copy/pasted answers.

She has never been outside and is terrified of the outdoors, but we can't find her inside so she must have run out. She is small (looks like a half-grown kitten, but she's two years old), light grey, and is not wearing a collar. She's very shy and fairly combative (feral parents) so it might be tricky to catch her if you spot her. She loves tuna and cat treats, though, so you might be able to get close to her that way. I suspect she's terrified. We live on Lydia Street, but I have no idea how far she would run if scared. If anyone finds her I will treat you to all the real-life karma I have available to me.

The text, for the non-FB crowd is below. I have made no edits.

What are /r/Louisville's thoughts on this?

&gt; I have a story your news team may be interested in...I emailed this to Eric Flack of Wave 3 but I am sharing it with all news stations..

&gt; I am writing to see if you're interested in covering a story involving a well-known Louisville restaurant and the truth behind the facade...
&gt; Yesterday I was terminated from Lynn's Paradise Cafe for not being able to bring in $100 cash for my shift. It is a new policy that started 1/2/13, stating that all food servers are required to carry $100 cash for each shift to use to tip out support staff (bussers and food runners). First of all, the new policy is absolutely unrealistic. Anyone who can afford to have one hundred dollars cash on them at any given time probably doesn't need to work as a server. Secondly, my manager who terminated me claimed that we were already required to bring in $50 cash everyday, which is untrue and was never a policy that was implemented in the 11 months that I was employed there, nor is it even in the employee handbook...I think that is something very important I would have remembered, don't you?! Also, had this been true, I would have been terminated a long time ago, seeing as having $50 at any given time is still unrealistic for me because I am single mother of a 2 1/2 year old boy...I stay home during the day while his father works and work part time at night. All of my funds go to paying necessary bills and buying groceries to feed my child.

&gt; It's especially heartbreaking to me because I am also expecting another child, due in late August. Some other mentionables are that I had never been wrote up or reprimanded for any faults during the duration of my employment with Lynn's Paradise Cafe. I was one of their best employees and very much respected, I thought...until yesterday when after being sent home for not having the hundred dollar bank, I called our main manager, Patty Schnatter to see if we would work something out to where I could change positions to be a hostess seeing as I could not afford to be part of the new policy taking place. She denied me any leeway and said I was terminated for ""breaking policy rule"". No warnings, no second chances, just terminated then and there, over the phone.

&gt; Now, is it just me, or is this unjust? I know this situation has my (used to be) fellow co-workers terrified for their jobs. Truthfully, this is the worst of the worst. Lynn and Patty were already known for firing their employees for little to no reason, but this ones really takes the cake.

&gt; I also have some information on other wrong-doings of theirs, and would be happy to answer any questions or refer you to those who have more input to make this a HUGE eye-opener for the city of Louisville. Considering all of the positive publicity that Lynn Winter receives via her request (heck, she probably pays the news anchors for their time!), I think that this would really cause a ruckus in our city. Luckily, it's all true and fact based and myself and others would be more than happy to divulge their dirty little secrets. Or even just this new policy that has resulted in a pregnant woman (myself!) being terminated, essentially for being poor. Not only was it humiliating for me but also has left me little hope for humanity at all.

&gt; Please help me bring this situation in the light and possibly get some kind of answers as to why this is happening...from what Patty said, the new policy is in place so that their employees can have health insurance. To me, it sounds like a cop out for Lynn's personal tax purposes and truthfully they're taking advantage of their hardworking, dedicated staff. For the record, no one signed anything regarding this new policy. There were memos placed around the restaurant for two weeks before it took place and yes, we were allowed to talk to management about it, but no one would because of fear of losing their job. I am walking proof of losing my job because I questioned the new policy and could not adhere to it.
Please, please, PLEASE join me in making this right and/or exposing the madness within ""Paradise"". I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Thank you in advance.

As you can see, I have been tweaking the sidebar and the CSS for [/r/Louisville](/r/Louisville) lately. This post is to ask for your thoughts and opinions on stylistic changes as well as links that should (and should not) be included on the sidebar. Please upvote this self-post (**for which I receive *NO* karma**) so that the whole subreddit can take a look and hopefully contribute.

I have been trying to get an image installed as the header, but I have been having some problems with the CSS on that. No, I did not break reddit yesterday. I am also working on a background image, **and I would like your thoughts on that**. It needs to be light enough that text can be easily read over it. Bearing that in mind, I may need some assistance altering any proposed image, as I am not a graphic designer of any sort.

In the first sidebar category, ""**Pro tips and visitor advice**"" please visit those threads and lend your opinions to them. They can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/mujz0/ins_and_outs_of_louisville/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/mujz0/ins_and_outs_of_louisville/).

See something you hate? Tell me about it, and if you make a valid case, I might remove the link or consider changing the style.

Is something missing? Tell me what you want to see, and I'll see about adding it. 

If someone posts an idea that you like or agree with, please show your support so we can have some sort of consensus. 

**TL;DR**: Input wanted on what's good, what's bad and what's missing from the sidebar. Also, input wanted on the look, feel and style of [/r/Louisville](/r/Louisville).

Hopefully, after the first line you read the whole thing in Professor Farnsworth's voice.

Usually there are even more protesters than normal (easter weekend) and having more escorts will help stop some of the harassment and aggression by protesters. Usually, volunteers arrive by 7am, and simply walk with women or otherwise help get to their appointment safely. Normally, we're done by 8:15, and many go to breakfast afterwards.

I would highly recommend against going here. I was forced to choose this barber shop over my regular shop when I was in a pinch to get a hair cut before Thanksgiving. Not only did it not look like I had received a hair cut (poorly trimmed side burns, edges over my ears and neck line. The barber managed to ""nick' my ear as he called it. There was actually a small chunk of my ear missing, it is still sore and healing... They also took a chunk of hair off on the back of my head near my neck line. I went back to get my money on four separate occasions. Each time I was told we can fix it for you, ""Yeah you're not touching my hair again."" I said. The manager said the particular barber that cut my hair would have to give my money back (he was busy one time, and away the other.) Then when I finally spoke with my ""butcher"" and he told me that they had a 24 hour return policy, he couldn't explain why this wasn't mention in prior conversations with the manager. Once I went back at a time specified by the manager and they were closed. I finally figured I wasn't getting my money back and gave up.

Hey Reddit,

My story, very quickly: as a very recently graduated 22yo guy from the Midwest, I'm essentially starting over in Louisville as a grad student at U of L. I know *not a soul* in the city, and while I know the general areas of interest and whatnot, it would be cool to meet up with some like-minded individuals from Reddit after I move in on the 1st of June. 

I've noticed the rampant ""What-should-I-do-in-Louisville-for-X-amount-of-time"" posts, so I don't mean to cover that ground again. However, if anyone was interested in getting drinks or food on the weekend of June 3 or 4 (or anytime, really), I would welcome the chance to meet some of you!

1361296637.0	18tuy6	I am visiting Kentucky in a couple weeks and wondering if I should stay in Louisville. 	Nature5667	36	4	87	"Me and the gf are coming down to your wonderful state in a couple weeks and I am undecided as to where to stay. I am coming down to get my bottles from Maker's Mark. I am coming from Chicago so my itinerary is this. First day(friday) we drive down by Bardstown/Loretto area and make it in time for Maker's Mark. The rest of the day is wide open. Saturday we will be doing the hard hat tour at Buffalo Trace at 11:30am by Frankfort. The rest of that day is wide open too. So, should we just stay in the locations by each distillery or Louisville both days? 
We are not party-goers but we wouldn't mind going somewhere for some good BBQ, drinks, local influenced foods, etc. 

Thanks for any suggestions. 

Edit to say that all you convinced me to stay both days in Louisville.  "	t5_2qqvg	True

It's been really difficult since then, and it's lead to me being evicted from my apartment as of, well, today. I THOUGHT I had a spot with my old roommate for a few weeks, but I was informed that someone else would be taking that place. 

So I'm stuck. I've been homeless before. It's a black hole that sucks your will to live. I can't go back to living in a shelter. I can't do it, not even temporarily. I've got NOWHERE to go. Nobody to stay with, no money, nothing. All I have are a few possessions, food stamps, and that's it.

I reached out to /r/assistance about the same situation, just when I thought I would be shacking with my ex-roommate, and got no traction. Downvoted, actually. So I come here, since this is a subreddit dedicated to the city I live in.

All I'm looking for is a roof for a few weeks. I have to get some money together to get my birth certificate, which in turn will allow me to ship myself off to Job Corps so that I can get some real skills that don't involve customer service. I can feed myself. 

I understand that it's a lot to ask; I'm some random guy on the internet. And I'm the reason why I'm in this situation. But it didn't go the way I planned it to, and now I'm screwed on a level that I never wanted to be screwed on again.

I need someone's help. Please.

I should also give some context: Lost my well paying job due to severe depression and unhappiness with said job that was affecting my performance. I have not had luck finding suitable employment or a program to assist in paying rent before my landlord got fed up. 

I sold what little I had that I was able to sell to have basic necessities,  and got on food stamps so I could continue to feed myself. I started looking into the Job Corps program, and really want to do it, only to find that I don't have a copy of my birth certificate and that it's going to cost money I don't have to have one mailed to me.

That's the context of the situation. I don't really know what I could use as proof, aside from a screen capture of my overdrawn bank account. I'll be as cooperative as I can be, though."	t5_2qqvg	True

Today my wife's bike was stolen from in front of her work at 6th &amp; Jefferson. It was a black, mid 80's Peugot that looks almost exactly like [this](http://www.fiataccompli.com/bike/photos/peugeot_conv_1.JPG), except her's has chrome, flat handlebars. She has already filed a police report, and unfortunately the courthouse does not have outside security cameras. We will be checking Craigslist and the local classifieds(and even some of the outlying counties if possible). We realize the chances of us locating the bike and getting it back are pretty slim, but we want to try every outlet possible, as this was her main form of transportation, and also a very nice bike that she put a lot of time, money and care into. 

Hopefully posting this here does not violate any rules, if so, then I understand if it gets taken down. We are keeping our fingers crossed that we can get it back and on the positive side, I am looking forward to helping her save up for a cool, new bike, and a new lock made of adamantium. 

And honestly, thank you for taking the time to read this.

""Students, faculty and staff,
 
The NCAA tournament is an important opportunity for the university to showcase itself and our community to the nation. We encourage our students, faculty and staff to attend the events in Atlanta and New Orleans.
 
Therefore, students attending the men’s or women’s Final Four will be excused from classes through the duration of the Cardinals’ participation. I expect instructors to allow make-up work or make other appropriate arrangements with them.
 
Due to the tournament, we will make some changes around campus:
 
To help prevent damage to personal and university property, the yellow (resident) parking lot north of Kurz Hall will be closed from noon Saturday through the morning after the men’s team plays its last game.  It is tentatively scheduled to reopen at noon on Tuesday, April 9.
 
Parking will not be permitted Saturday or Monday on Fourth Street between Bloom and Industry Boulevard, Third Street between Bloom and Eastern Parkway, Unity Place, Cardinal Boulevard between Third and Fourth, and Brandeis between Third and Fourth.
 
Parking also will not be permitted this weekend in the blue lot between Brandeis and Cardinal and after noon Saturday on both sides of Unity Place and in the recently added spaces on the Chevron property. All resident parking should move to the Edwards property lot across the railroad tracks from Kurz Hall. Extra security will be on duty throughout the weekend, and the pedestrian bridge will be open.
 
Beginning at 6 p.m. on Saturday and, if necessary, again on Monday, Third Street will be closed between Bloom and Eastern Parkway. Fourth Street will be closed between Bloom and Industry Road. Cardinal will be closed from Fourth Street to First Street.
Cardinal Boulevard, Brandeis Avenue and Bloom Street will be closed between Third and Fourth streets. Unity Place also will be closed. Additional roadblocks will be set up, eliminating access to the interior of campus, fraternity row and affiliated housing on Fourth Street.
 
Cars left in these areas will be towed at the owner’s expense.
 
To further protect our students, if the men win their Saturday evening game, all Monday classes beginning at or after 4:15 p.m. will be canceled. If the women win their Sunday evening game, all Tuesday classes beginning at or after 4:15 p.m. will be canceled.
 
Thank you for your understanding and support. The teams are bringing significant national recognition to our university. We should all support their efforts and enjoy the ride.
 
Go Cards!""


I was in Lexington last year to celebrate our championship weekend and it was hell of fun, even though a few idiots had to ruin it for us; I'm assuming these road/parking lot closures were put in place to try and keep shit from going down this weekend. I wasn't even alive when Louisville last won a championship, so I have no clue what to expect when watching the games this weekend.

Sparklepuff	39	10	49	"So, last night (7/19) my boyfriend, his sister and I were heading back home from a concert and we took 65 as usual. We turn, and immediately noticed about 3 planes, very low in the sky, but they weren't moving. At first I thought it was just relative motion playing tricks on me, but after a moment of observation it was clearly VTOL airplanes. Some were hovering right above the trees. We counted 17 going south, spaced 3 to 5 miles apart and they alternated which side of the road they were on, with a few exceptions, like the one that we drove under that was hovering directly overhead. These didn't look like the typical harrier-style jets either, their wings were longer and more horizontal, they didn't come down at an angle. Most of them had what appeared to be landing lights on, 2 pointing forward and one shining down. Of course we've looked online to see if there were any military drills or exercises going on, but have found nothing. I am just extremely curious about the who and why, that's a large number of VTOL jets in one spot and very expensive. Any insight on this is greatly appreciated.

Two things:

1. Please be safe. I've not heard of any recent crimes like this in the area and it does seem like petty theft but these people may be targeting houses in the neighborhood. Make sure all your windows are shut and locked up when you go to work even though the weather is awesome. I'd hate this to happen to anyone else.

P.S.

This is the only thing I still need to get rid of - it's my 100% converted to run on used cooking oil, 1992 F250 7.3 IDI diesel. The engine is stock and the one that came with the truck, and has only 133k on it, so it's got another 200k before you even need to look at it. I've done a two tank conversion for straight veggie oil, with a heated tank, fuel line and injector line, and a new fuel pump. I've got 12k on veggie oil driving this truck myself, and it'll easily go on. Over the year I've had it I've also: 
Put four new tires on it (80% life remaining) 
New battery cable 
New rear cylinders and axle seals 
New brake master cylinder 
New bumper 
New flex lines and brake lines 
New fuel lines 
New fuel system 
Moved the selector valve up underneath the hood 
New injector return caps and lines

As far as body goes, it's rough, but not rusty. Interior is about the same, maybe a little better. I bought it as a farm truck, and then used it mostly to get back and forth to school, so it was worked hard, but then I put 12k highway miles on it and it did fine. It's got a 5th wheel, and if you want I'll throw in the bumper I took off it, which is a big shock bumper made for hauling very heavy boats.  There's also a matching topper and bedliner. I'll include the grease collection pump, collection buckets, a filtering barrel and some filters, to get you everything you need to start burning grease instead of $4.00 diesel. I've got $3.5k in it, but I'll take 2500 if I can move it this weekend before I fly out.

I was a freshman at Male when the [first proposal for a light rail system](http://brokensidewalk.com/2011/12/05/a-quick-look-back-at-light-rail-in-louisville/) was released, and though nothing came of it, it planted the idea in my head.

It never really made much sense to me that Louisville has no rail transportation. Plenty of cities about Louisville's size (or smaller!) have developed successful systems.  I suspect it is almost entirely due to the cost and [Louisvillian's love of their cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USCommutePatterns2006.png), which is a real shame because this town is so advantageously suited for a ~~profitable~~ successful (wrong word!) modest light rail system.  All within a neat stretch you have an international airport, a convention center, a large university (and a couple smaller higher education centers), three large sports venues, many many major large job centers and more!

I moved away from Louisville so I don't keep up with the goings-on here much, but I am a transit geek and ever since that report I've had a vision for a light rail system in the River City.  Just recently I picked up learning Illustrator, so I had a go at making a hypothetical system map of my idea:

http://imgur.com/kTgPoom

The system is based on the 2002 proposal, modified with my own ideas.  You can also view a [Google Maps version here](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=202700289271777751658.0004bf27a6b40f25a6973&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=38.233596,-85.702114&amp;spn=0.082656,0.191402), showing the unstylized route.  

I'm hoping this can sort of spark a conversation if shown to the right people.  Any tips or suggestions on the route or the map itself, or who would be interested in seeing it are greatly appreciated!"	t5_2qqvg	True

The basic premise is building a sports bar around eSports (competitive video gaming, think the hardcore SC2/DotA matches) as opposed to the usual foot/basket/whateverball.

With Lanwar/MillionManLAN being here (although I don't know how big it is anymore, it was huge back in the day), I figure there's a decent gaming community.  Add in the college crowd, would this work around here?  Or is it an idea for ""if I move to X, I'm gonna...""?"	t5_2qqvg	True

I went to the new bridge today for the first time and couldn't believe all of the waste left behind from the responsible pet owner's who do pick up their poop. I really mean that too. Even when you pick the poop up it still leaves a nasty residue behind that stains the concrete and can still get on your shoes. My friend was busy looking at the city as we were walking and stepped right in some! At another spot it looked like shit literally exploded out of this poor dog because it was everywhere (stretched all the way across the center bike lane) You could see where other dogs and people trampled straight through it and spread it even more. Other dogs yapping at people walking by. Dogs barking at each other. It's almost like some people are just trying to make some type of point by bring their many dog's up there. I would never take my animals on that bridge (end up with some disease). I just hope they ban animals really soon. It would be a lot better experience then!! Also I noticed people had their dogs on leashes (of course) but were constantly getting in the way of the bikers. Totally ruining the experience for them as well.	t5_2qqvg	True
1364509576.0	1b7ecz	Moving to Louisville from X.	veritas7882	33	5	23	"I frequently see posts in this subreddit from people moving to our city from out of state looking for information about the city.  Can we work together to come up with something full of information we can link them to each time one of these comes up for convenience and to make sure we're not leaving anything out?  Perhaps even something the mods can add to the ""Links to local information"" section.  There's already a ""Pro tips and visitor advice"" link so maybe we can expand that to include people that are relocating as well?

Edit:
Here's what I've compiled from the posts so far, if there's something you'd like to see added (or corrected) just reply to the main post and I'll add it: 

You can't beat living in the Highlands. I've lived in about every part of this town at one point or another, and it's by far the best place. Convenient, fun, friendly, 15mins from anywhere in the city.. It's the place to be. St. Matthews/East end of town are more your place if you're into the whole stuffy white suburb thing. There's nothing really here thats terrible that's not unavoidable. There are areas of town like Portland that I wouldn't recommend visiting unless you're into the whole poor white trash thing. Old Louisville, for college students especially, is an amazing community. Cheaper rent than the university housing, plus larger spaces! I live about 3 blocks north of campus and pay $500 a month for a huge 1BR with private parking, patio, and all the amenities. I was paying $700 for a 2BR roommate place at Bettie Johnson Halls. Not to mention, Old Louisville is a great area for taking walks, riding bikes (bike lanes on 3rd St. and further north on 2nd St.), and watching plays in Central park. There's even a few good restaurants and local businesses that are within walking distance too. I always consider Old Louisville an older and cheaper version of the Highlands. West end...we don't talk about the west end. South end is a fine example of when redneck meets urban city. Downtown has a lot of nice places, but between traffic, parking, and lack of anything particularly diverse to do within walking distance of anywhere, it has a lot of drawbacks (plus higher rent)...

As far as social life goes, there's something for everyone. The city is loaded with museums, parks, and other great kid friendly things. The Highlands is a great area for mommy and daddy to explore. A lot of local shops and bars in that area. Churchill Downs is an obvious point of interest. Names of some local landmarks worth at least knowing about include Waverly Hills Sanitarium, Cherokee Park, Waterfront Park, Iroquois Park, Muhammad Ali Center, Fraiser Art Museum, Kentucky Center for the Arts, Kentucky Kingdom (closed down amusement park, set to reopen under new management in 2014) and the Belle of Louisville. We have a big boating crowd that's not to hard to become acquainted with, if that's your thing. Always open-to-join sports (football, soccer, frisbee, etc.) going on on the Great Lawn by the river (exactly as it sounds, a big big lawn). Country clubs, go karting, laser tag, indoor/outdoor kickball/volleyball/anything you can think of leagues. It's definitely not hard to meet people here, and we're a pretty friendly bunch, for the most part.  There are a lot of events that revolve around the Kentucky Derby that are pretty cool and family friendly such as a firework show, parade, steam boat and hot air balloon races.

Night life is super active. 4th St. Live is the place to get your dance on, and is usually a 22-32 age range. It's got generally the highest drink prices in town, and tends to attract the ""affliction"" types, but it can be fun with a group. St Matthews bars are a bit of a mixup. Drakes, restaurant by day, ""cougar club"" by night. One side dance club, other side very loud sit-down bar. Molly Malones (St. Matthews, there are a couple) is a good mix of music and conversation. Further down the street you have bars like Dark Star, which tend to be the friendly, cleaned up hole in the wall type places. The highlands (Bardstown Rd. area) is the land of the Irish pubs. Peaceful, chat-with-strangers drinking by day, live music/dj's by night. They tend to be nice in that the dance floor is usually a pretty decent ways away from the main bar area, so they tend to attract a nice mix of people.
Food, you can't go wrong. Breakfast at Toast on Main or Wild Eggs, lunch at a pub or grab a bite from Franks on Preston HWY (Delicious in-house cut meats, home grown fruits and veggies, and a lunch you can munch on for a day or two will run you about $4), and dinner at anything from one of a dozen amazing sushi places, to the few 4/5-star steakhouses, or anything in between. Louisville's surprisingly well-known for our food. We did invent the cheeseburger, after all.

So here is what I propose to any of you reading this. I need a ride to and from. It's about 2 hours away, and it starts at 8am and goes until 5pm, from what I understand. And I don't intend on leaving whoever sticks their hand in the cookie jar without funds.

I will pay for gas. I will also give you money for lunch while you are there. No sexual favors, no high amounts of money, just a man willing to give to a person who his giving themselves. All I ask for is a day of your time.

This is extremely important to me. If I didn't have to take this computer and could ship it, I would. It would make my life so much easier.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully I get some replies. You're all great, and go Cards."	t5_2qqvg	True

I personally don't find these actions to be local, loving, or indicative of any kind of support. Especially since the name of UO is painted in huge letters across the two visible sides of the building.

Weather or not you like HCC, they are a vibrant local business that does not deserve to be blighted out by a corporate bully. As much as Louisville and /r/Louisville (myself included) cries out ""*buy local*"" this makes me particularly sick."	t5_2qqvg	True

Although we all speak of the duck fat goodness at hammerheads, that's not a regular weekend stop for most due to the crowds that yelp and urbanspoon pours in from all over the place. I'm looking for the ""off the radar"" type places that for some reason, escaped the press they deserve.

I'll start:

Cumberland Brews - Not very secret, but I go here once or twice a week. I love it. If this place was in Chicago, Cincinnati, etc., it would be packed to the brim and lose the character I love about it so much. Though the service is sometimes lacking and it can be difficult to find a table or seat on a Friday/Saturday night, it's always worth the wait for me. You can't beat the chorizo quesadilla and the fabulous pale ale...especially at their prices. This place was the reason I fell in love with Louisville in the beginning.

He is:


About 3 years old


Brown and Black


Name is Scout


Very sweet, and friendly


Has a collar, tags and micro chip. Might also be wearing a RED bark collar


If you see him, please call the number on the tags DAY OR NIGHT. He was in a yard on E Fairmont Ave in south Louisville.


PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CALL IF YOU SEE OR FIND HIM. Flyers will up in the morning, but there is a lot of bad things and places he can get into out here. He is not used to the city and I just have him for the week so he doesn't know where home is.


UPDATE: Scout is still missing. Flyers are up and everyone has been called including vets, humane society, and microchip company. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. His mom is very worried and is far away in Idaho on vacation

UPDATE 2:  I have had NO luck finding Scout.  I have driven around my surrounding area multiple times and put up flyers.  Posted on multiple sites and called all around. I'm not sure what else to do.


UPDATE: Scout has been found and is home safe, in case anyone here cares.  He was found almost 10 miles away off of Outer Loop."	t5_2qqvg	True

I think a meet up should be in order. I just want to get an idea on how many people would want to be in attendance and what kind of age group we're dealing with. If a majority is 21 and older we will hit up a bar, if not we can find something else to do. I'd be more than happy to take the helm on this and get the ball rolling (an impromptu meetup resulted in 6 redditors getting drunk at New Albanian a couple weeks ago)

Either post here or let me know what you all want to do and what age group we're dealing with.

EDIT: Alright, it seems that there is a profound demand for a reddit meet up. So far roughly 20 people want to show. 20 people is a whole lot for us to go out to a restaurant and I feel the weather is not going to cooperate for a cookout. Any suggestions would be more than welcome.

EDIT 2: A majority of people seem to be interested in a bar (I personally think that Sergio's would be ideal for this but nothing's for sure) but I do want to include our under-21 redditors yet sadly have no ideas as to what we could do. Someone mentioned Incredible Dave's which I personally don't have any experience with.

**EDIT 3: Ok, so we have a few decent ideas. Sergio's, Incredible Dave's, and Bowling (I'm gonna throw Lazer Blaze in there). I think I'm going to plan it for sometime over the month of December as it seems a majority of the readers are in college. Sometime in the next few days I'll post a poll (where to go, roughly when to have it etc) on what everyone wants to do and we will go from there.**

Regarding the Fair Board, it is interesting that they have never explained why they stopped negotiating with us, yet were ready to sign a less favorable deal with Holiday World which then made the Fair Board victim to Holiday World's delaying tactics. These delaying tactics have resulted in our community having to wait until at least 2014 for the 1,000 jobs and other economic benefits associated with an open and vibrant Kentucky Kingdom.

Also to consider is the fact that the state's tourism cabinet has recently approved two tourism tax credit applications --  one for the Ark Park and one for Bluegrass Boardwalk -- neither of which has broken ground. Yet, the tourism cabinet would not approve our application even though we had committed the substantial sum of more than $29 million to the park.  Had our offer been accepted Kentucky Kingdom would be open today.""

11am-11pm, 6/22 at the Ramada Plaza Convention Center just off of Hurstbourne. (9700 Bluegrass Parkway, 40299)
Admission is $5 at the door

We've got somewhere over 200 titles to check out of the library, and usually a lot of people bring their own games if we don't have a copy.

There is a Netrunner tournament kicking off at ~1pm.

Kids are welcome, we usually have a handful playing near the main desk.
There is a Wick's Pizza on site, and we get a 10% discount off of food items.

With any luck I'll get a game of Battlestar going. We usually have a huge game of Eclipse, a lot of Ticket to Ride, Lords of Waterdeep, a few Steve Jackson games, and occasionally some Arkham Horror.
Eventually (~9pm) things tend to devolve into Card Against Humanity and a few other party games as some of the longer games wrap up.

Aside from individually sending letters to our representatives, what can we in Louisville do about this? I am open to hearing any and all *post-partisan* ideas. I am willing to find common ground on this issue with anyone who is equally concerned.

Plan a rally? Civil disobedience? A concerted letter-writing campaign or petition? Since we are not enormous corporations with millions of dollars for lobbying, I feel that we are nearly powerless, but I also believe that the steady erosion of our rights since 9/11/01 is the most significant political issue of our time.

I'm not interested in defeatism, cynicism, conspiracy theories, or partisanship. I'm interested in taking action. Let's hear your ideas.

I'm an aspiring filmmaker looking to start up a new film group/production company here in Louisville, and I'm putting the word out here on Reddit, as I have on Facebook and Craigslist, to try and get people that are interested in putting together some new movies!

Right now, I'm working on writing/budgeting a few shorts, but I'd say those are a little ways down the road.

What I need are people interested and either experienced or willing and able to learn different aspects of the filmmaking process.  I'd say it'll be a learning experience for most of us.

While I'll be holding casting calls, I'd like to have a few interested actors being part of the group, as well.

I have a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/305071639599469/) set up for the group.

We're having a [meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/115361771964411/) for anyone interested scheduled on the 12th, which is the saturday after next, but the location is tentative based on the number of people that plan to attend.  The link to the event is on the facebook group page as well.

List your favorite school in Louisville. Tell us about it. Why did you go there? What did you study? How much did you spend? Did it pay off? What were the professors like? Any details you feel like sharing.

**Some Guidelines:**

* I'd like to keep this thread about schools beyond high school. K-12 might be interesting fodder, but we'll save that for another thread another time.

* Any school in the MSA is listable. This includes southern IN and some surrounding areas. Public, private, for profit, non profit, whatever.

* Please list editorials about schools. Good, bad, indifferent, etc. 

* Please list as many details as you can. For example:  
**Spalding University, private, non profit, http://www.spalding.edu, Bachelors, Masters, PhD, Evening/Weekend classes, tuition and fees vary by program $390-850/credit hour.**

* Lets be civil though. If you don't like a school that someone else has listed, don't go to that school. Let's not turn this into a ""which school is ""*better*"". This is for information for people looking to Louisville as a future home, people looking to start or go back to college, or even just people that are curious.

So that everyone has a chance to see this and contribute, please upvote this *self post*, for which I receive **zero** karma. Thanks!

AlpineKyle	27	3	15	"I was driving home from a friends house about 11:30pm tonight coming from Crestwood on Legrange Road towards Louisville. When I met an older Jeep wrangler coming the other direction, I'm positive it was a Wrangler as the headlights are unmistakeable and the fact there was an arm hanging out of the drivers side, where there was no door. I didn't think anything of it, as we passed him he threw (I think a can) full of dip spit, and other nasty liquids onto my windshield. It hit with a loud enough thud I thought it was going to come through and instantly covered my windshield with nasty gooey liquid. It took a few minutes to get where I could see again, and by time I turned around he was long gone. Fortunately there wasn't any damage to my vehicle, and a $10 car wash at a nearby gas station, seemed to get rid of most of it. 

Why do dumb asses do this shit?! That could have easily caused a wreck and killed someone WTF?!!!!!

Crestwood Sheriff doesn't have a 24 hour dispatch but I will be calling them Monday morning to let them know this happened. Any other recommendations would be appreciated.

I drive it 5 days a week, and 5 days a week I see the same idiocy.  I see people in the far right exit lane, speeding by as if they were heading to St. Matthews exit, only to take the ""right-left"" exit lane onto I-264 West.  Not only is that frustrating, but it stops the legitimate ""left-left"" traffic going smoothly to I-264 West.  

People see the ""left-left"" lane slow, so they get in the ""right-left"" lane to squeeze by, and get stuck at the top of the offramp because nobody wants to let them over b/c they know exactly what they're doing...eventually that person is going to cut over, causing the person in the ""left-left"" lane to jam on their brakes, causing the rest of traffic in the ""left-left"" lane to stop and/or slow down, and causing more people to try and slide over into the right lane and squeeze into that ""right-left"" lane.

What's the definition of insanity again?

Does anybody who if there is a Louisville Metro Planning Department, or if there is a Department of Transportation meeting that this issue can be brought up at?

I live in the Louisville, KY area.  I'm just looking for any freaking way to earn this money.  I have a really good window AC unit (8000 BTU) and really nice wallet that was given to me as a gift worth 200 bucks.  I've been trying to sell them for fair prices on craigslist and such.  Not too much interest in an AC during this time of the year and not much interest in buying a luxury wallet.  

**What can I do?!  I'm hoping someone has some awesome ideas or ways I haven't heard of.**


And since I'm sure asking family will come up, I entered foster care at age 13 and stayed until 18.  Parental rights were terminated.  I am in and out of contact with my biological family.  I'm welcomed as family, but there is still an awkward barrier because of my absence.  tldr; I don't have anyone to turn to in order to borrow it short term.

*Edit1: Thanks for the great responses.  I have a few directions to go so far, and have already made some calls to try and get the ball rolling in a few different directions.  Here's one more suggestion I got posting elsewhere, just in case someone else out there is interested. Selling tutoring. * 

*I'm going to test the waters with this.  I earned quite a few AP credits in high school, that may be the easiest to find students in.  I'm starting at 15/hr and offering to give a full refund if our first hour just doesn't go well at all.*

He is a 3 year old brown tabby with white feet. He should have a couple of blue claw covers on his front paws. He weighs about 12 pounds and his name is Dumpling, but I usually call him fatty (he's not so fat now, but he used to be rather chubby). He is very friendly but is probably terrified. He hasn't been outside since he was 3 days old.

Thanks for your help! Please PM me on here if you find him.

Police have already been called and informed of course, but he gave me permission to post here about it; The more people that know and can see, the better.

It happened on the corner of South 2nd st and W. Kentucky street and the items taken are:

His backpack, it's a messenger back meant for carrying a laptop; Black with what appears from first glance to be a paint spill design on it. 

His sketchbook, has quite a few drawings in it; His pencil set for drawing.

A wacom bamboo drawing tablet with drawing pen.

His laptop. A Gateway NV7082u

His phone, a Verizon Samsung Intensity II SCH-U460

And his keys.

The phone, laptop and drawing tablet I expect to turn up in a pawn shop somewhere but the backpack, sketchbook, pencils and keys are expected to just be ditched in a trashcan, the side of the road or a dumpster.

Any information should be given to the LMPD.

We will be hosting a lectureship and silent auction fundraiser on March 20, 2013, at Hillbilly Tea. The proceeds from the silent auction will go towards the Children's Miracle Network, with 100% of those donations staying in their Louisville partner hospital, Kosair Children's Hospital. 


We need your help to make the silent auction fundraiser a success!  If you own a local business, or have connections with a local business owner, we'd love it if you could donate an item, a service, or perhaps a gift card.  Any kind of donation is certainly appreciated!


I can assure you this gift will be put to good use. This year alone, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals will provide health care worth billions, yet children's hospitals depend on community support to help fund their vital services. As of 2011, the Children's Miracle Network has raised $4.3 billion for their network hospitals. 


These children's hospitals are available 24 hours a day to help kids of every age and background overcome every imaginable disease and injury. These children's hospitals are also on the front lines of preventing disease and injury through research, education, and outreach programs that keep millions of kids out of the hospital each year. 


Phi Delta Epsion Chapters each raise at least $1,000 for their local children's hospital each year. We also volunteer our time several times a month at the oncology ward of Kosair. providing companionship to the children with cancer and helping to ease their discomfort of being at the hospital. 


I'm proud to contribute to the wellbeing of these children, and hope you will be, too. 


Donations may be sent to our Louisville Phi Delta Epsilon address:
Phi Delta Epsilon
University of Louisville - Health Sciences Campus
500 South Preston Street
B Building, Room 29
Louisville, KY 40292

(More in text and if you would like to sponsor our N64 Super Smash Bros event, check it out)	dosequisxx	21	1	7	"For the past 5 years, I have put on large charity, tournament style events at the University of Louisville. They are free tournaments to enter, and all we ask is donations to help out the organization and all prizes and food are donated or put on our sponsor's account. Last year was CoD:MW3 in which we had 200 in attendance and raised $1000 for the Center for Women and families. We have helped out other organizations as well such as Dare to Care.

This year we are hosting a N64 Super Smash Bros tournament in February. I am starting early to get some things set in stone and was wondering if any one had a charity that is dear to their heart. If there is any post for a reputable charity that has a lot of people who believe it to be good, I will choose them.

Also, I need sponsors for this event. I already have prizes for the singles winner but need some for the doubles as well as potential food. I have 2 sponsors already, 1 who has given a Wii for the singles winner, and the 2nd who has said they will pay for the venue as well as equipment rental fees. If you would like to help sponsor it, please contact me through here or lplouisville@edrtrust.com.

I am hoping for a great turn out and would love it when the event comes around, if a few redditors would come as well who don't attend UofL.

My dream company (which is obviously in Louisville) just posted an open position in my field. I'm absolutely stoked about it and I'll be applying tonight. I know, I know, ""you haven't even had an interview yet"". Doesn't matter if I don't get it this time around, now that I meet their experience qualifications, I'll be applying until I get it.

I want to know more about Louisville! I've read the wikipedia entry. I've read the visitors guide and the ""ins and outs"" posted here. I want to know more so if I'm asked in an interview ""what attracts you to Louisville"" I'm prepared.

I'm 28, my wife is 25 and we have a 1 year old son. We love live music (especially the free variety), art and science museums, parks, good relaxed bars when we can find a babysitter, astronomy, etc. What is available in these areas? My wife stays at home with our son, are there good communities for SAHP's?

We currently live in South Florida (making less money than the company in Louisville pays) paying $1250/mo for a 2 bedroom. What is the average for a 2 bedroom there? Is it possible to rent in a rural area with some useable land (we like to garden) and still live within 30 minutes of downtown? How bike friendly is the city if we decide to live in the city and I commute to work?

I've encountered the bastards before, and there was no mistaking the shape or the smell when I crushed it. 

I'm pretty sure I don't have an infestation at my place (unless it's very new), so I'm thinking it probably was brought in with someone's bag from an infested dorm or apartment and crawled up from the booth. Look 'em up if you don't know what they look like and stick to tables for a while.

1375883269.0	1jvs58	Fix Time Warner Cable streaming issues	trevxor	25	4	16	"Hello everyone. I was lurking this board looking for solutions to my (and apparently everyone else's) issues with TWC, and couldn't find anything, so I did a little research of my own. I came across [this article](http://gigaom.com/2013/06/17/time-warner-cable-no-we-dont-throttle-youtube-its-all-about-peering/) saying that TWC had denied throttling streaming sites like Youtube, Netflix, and Twitch. Bullshit, I said! This has to be the problem. 

So here's the fix: TWC isn't ""actively"" throttling our connections, but we are getting our content from one of ""their"" servers instead of YT, NF, or Twitch, like we should. The solution is to block the IP of the server. If you're on a Mac, [go here](http://mitchribar.com/2013/02/time-warner-cable-sucks-for-youtube-twitchtv/), and if you're on Windows, [here](http://mitchribar.com/2013/02/how-to-stop-youtube-sucking-windows-guide/). Only blocking the first IP worked for me, so try them one at a time.

My wife babysits, we have two kids.

I just started a job with Time Warner (Insight) as tech support. I'm going to start later this week.  

Lease is up and we have to be out of here by Friday. We were supposed to be moved out two weeks ago, but I'm getting jerked around by my new future landlord.


We just leased a car from a guy that also rents houses. He was very friendly and we got to talking. His car lot is right down the street from our condo.


I've been crippled by anxiety.  I've finally gotten help and medication.  I'm about to start this great job.  I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, I'm so close.  I don't like making excuses and I don't like asking for help...but I'm desperate.


My future landlord told me we could move in for free, he understood I was about to start this job so he told me he'd let us move in for free and I'd pay the 500 with next month's rent. He claims he has been continuing to work on the house and has stalled our attempts to move in over and over. And now it's almost too late.
I'm getting ready to start a great job, I'm so close, time is my biggest enemy right now.


In the meantime, I'm going to spend this week doing absolutely everything I can to chip away at this 500.


If there is anyone out there that can help save my family, I'd be...beyond words. I can pay it back within a month. I don't have Paypal however :(

I'm supposed to be on the 20.0 plan, but have been seeing speeds between 3.5 and 8.0. I called Insight a month ago, and after two missed appointments (Can't complain too much as they gave me $40), the tech showed up. He confirmed the speed issue, pretty much replaced everything, but no luck. Still slow.

I talked to a second tech a couple of weeks ago. She advised that there ""Known Utilization Issues"" in my area. She advised that they've been told ""not to send techs out"" and an ETA on the fix was not able to be provided. Asked to speak to a Supervisor. Supervisor also advised the same thing and could not give me an ETA on when it will be fixed.

I asked if she could escalate the issue to someone who could give me a date. She said she would try, but nobody likely knew. I asked her for a refund for my service for the past three weeks. She obliged (we'll see if it makes it to my bill) and said she would try to escalate the issue.

Today, it's a rainy day, everyone is at home, and my speeds are around 3 meg down, so I can't really watch Netflix.

Is anyone else seeing the same issues? I would suggest anyone with the same issue to call and demand a refund to light a fire under their behinds. I hate to say it, but Insight isn't going to fix the issue until they feel it in their wallet.

Edit:  Be sure to check your speed at Speedtest.net. If you're not seeing speeds close to 10 mbps down (if paying for 10.0), then you should call to get it fixed and get a credit on your bill."	t5_2qqvg	True

I think it's better to take this kind of course than to take swipes or invite more press to the other side. In terms of ""news"" the best way to get something to go away is to ignore it, and I'm glad to see HC refocusing their efforts on themselves and their own brand rather than what other people are or are not doing.

I want to explain the feature first, and our first featured business will be listed at the bottom of this post. A link to the *Featured Business* post will be in the announcement bar.

Periodically, we will be choosing a local business to feature in the announcement bar. There are no *strict* criteria for this feature, but there are a few guidelines if you want to make nominations or suggestions. 

* If you want to make a suggestion/nomination, please explain why. Just giving us a business name tells us nothing. We want to know *why* a business should be called to everyone's attention.

* The business must be truly local. Owned, operated, and located in Louisville, KY. We will accept businesses that are located in the [MSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_metropolitan_area).

* Businesses can be self nominated by their owners and/or employees.

* Service(s) provided to /r/Louisville will be taken into consideration, but will in no way guarantee a spot as the featured business. This is not *quid pro quo*.

* This is not advertising. Nothing will change hands for this. Businesses will be chosen by a combination of three criteria: reader nomination, the business's individual merit, and random selection.

**Our first featured business is [Meme-Tech](http://www.meme-tech.com/)! They so graciously printed the stickers people are reporting all over U of L's campus.**

Many of you will know me, a lot of you wont. I am of course the mod for our little subreddit. WOOT! (Well until today) I am now currently joined by [whothefucksaidthat](http://www.reddit.com/user/whothefucksaidthat) and [tundrawolf_](http://www.reddit.com/user/TundraWolf_)

I have been away for about 2 and half months. My family had been riddled with issues and I thought it ok to step back for a time thinking theMrautomatic was here and was our fellow moderator. Needless to say he disappeared and you can't even bring the page up anymore. 

I am very sorry about this. I never meant to leave the subreddit unmanned and I appologize to any of you who had submissions go into the spam filter and never be fixed or ask us questions and never had them answered. It will not happen agian.

As we have grown from a /r with only 76 members when I took over to 2 members away from only 1000( Im sure atleast 2 of you have alts that could join )  I have realised with whothefucksaidthat's help that we need more staffing. 
 
i hope all of you are doing well and that our little space on the internet can continue to grow and be benefecial to all of us. any questions comments or concerns is welcome at any time. 

Cheers!

However, I've been pretty happy with PNC. I've had them for a little over a year and they've never been anything but helpful and friendly to me. I think the only reason I'd change would be if there was a credit union, or another bank for that matter, that could offer an improvement over PNC.

Does anyone know of a credit union or likewise that could or should be better than PNC?"	t5_2qqvg	True

I've been living on my own for the last two years in this two bedroom apartment on Speed Avenue, very near Bardstown Road. The building looks a little worn, but the apartments themselves are rather nice.

You would pay $338/month in rent. That covers everything except gas/electricity and Insight services.

I need someone I can get along with. Of course, applicants need a stable income. Any hobby you may have is perfectly welcome, as that is none of my business. I would ask that if it is a messy one, such as a painter or similar style of artist, that you clean up after yourself.

I would prefer someone who has lived on their own before, but that is not a requirement. The building allows smoking indoors, but I ask you to keep that outside. I'll handle pretty much all of the cleaning (seriously) but if you make a mess it is only considerate to clean up after yourself.

I have one cat. Her name is Kitty Face. She is about as sweet as a living creature can be. I wish I could welcome other animals, but that would bump the rent up.

If anyone has any questions, let me know. If interested, I'll message you the address and my cell phone number. I'll be reachable for showings after 5pm every night this week, except Friday and Saturday when I work my second job.

::edit::

Many thanks to everyone who has replied! I apologize if this was misleading. This is not a room in a house. It is a room in my two bedroom apartment, in an apartment building. Very sorry to those of you who arrived expecting something else.

To be clear. This is a *room* in an *apartment* on the top floor of a three level *building*. Not a house. Again, apologies to those who felt mislead."	t5_2qqvg	True

This is a website I created while working for Iglou Internet Services here in Louisville. While it has it's own lost and found section, the search function also searches all other lost and found websites in the Louisville area (humane society, lost pets kentuckiana, craigslist etc). 

It's still in the debugging phase, but it is largely complete and for all intensive purposes ready for the public eye. I hope it allows you to find lost items and pets more easily, instead of jumping from place to place. The databases update every three hours, so If your post from craigslist etc doesn't show up immediately, be patient."	t5_2qqvg	True

I moved here in July to start medical school at the best college in the world, UofL! I am quickly falling in love with this city! I am also falling in love with the kiddos I volunteer with at Kosair Children's hospital oncology unit. 

To show my support to these amazing and brave kids, I am shaving my hair on February 6th, 2013 for St. Baldrick's (www.stbaldricks.org). St. Baldrick's is a non-profit that funds childhood cancer research. Kosair Children's Hospital is one recipient of these funds. I'm super excited to be a part of it! However, I need your help! I have a goal of $1000 to raise before I shave my head. If you would be willing to donate anything, even $1 to my cause, I'd really appreciate it!!! The donation is tax-deductible.

Just simply go to this website: http://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/kelseygoesbald 
(You can see my before picture. I am a lady and my hair is already a bit longer than the picture shows!)

You can donate directly on the webpage, by phone, or by mail. I really appreciate any and all support. Also, I am going to send thank-you notes to all those who donate. So, if you'd like a handwritten note, please pm me an address and you'll get one! If you'd rather keep your address private, just comment below and you'll get a virtual thank-you.

Again, thank-you for any and all support!!

p.s. I messaged the mods and they said it was okay if I posted this request here. Please don't take offense, I just want to help these kids out :)



**TL;DR: I am shaving my hair to support kids with cancer. My fundraising goal is $1000--all money going to St. Baldrick's (www.stbaldricks.org). Please follow the link above if you'd like to help out. Thank-you notes given to those who donate and comment below or pm me an address. Thanks!**

&gt;Dear Forecastle Travelers ~
&gt;
&gt;The Forecastle Festival is thrilled to announce that My Morning Jacket will headline and assist in curating the festival’s 10th Anniversary. The 3-day event will take place July 13 – 15, 2012, at Louisville’s scenic, award-winning Waterfront Park.
&gt;
&gt;My Morning Jacket, whose original members hail from Louisville and currently reside in the city, will headline Saturday night, and will collaborate with producers on festival sights, sounds and experiences, as well as charitable aspects of the event. Celebrating its tenth year, the festival will pay homage to its past, present, and future, highlighting Forecastle’s maritime theme while celebrating the very best of Louisville and Kentucky.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Over 75 additional artists will be announced in the upcoming weeks, including the Friday and Sunday night headliners. Separately ticketed late-night events will take place aboard The Ship (Belle of Louisville) as well as at the newly renovated Ice House.
&gt;
&gt;Tickets will go on-sale January 27 at 12pm (EST), including a limited quantity of specially-priced, $100 weekend passes. They can be purchased online at forecastlefest.com. Once this quantity is sold out, tickets will continue to be available at the next level ticket price. Travel packages will also be available, including accommodations at The Galt House – the festival’s official, waterfront hotel. For those who wish to dock up for the weekend, VIP “Captain’s Club” boat slips will also be available.
&gt;

This program is modeled after the “ciclovía” program in Bogotá, Colombia, where for 30 years, citizens have enjoyed weekly car-free streets. 

This should be a really fun event and a great time to experience one of the city's most exciting streets in a completely new way.

If you'd like to help support CycLOUvia, please take a moment to donate as little as $1 at: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brokensidewalk/cyclouvia-opening-bardstown-road-to-everyone. They only need $677.00 to reach their $3000 goal!
