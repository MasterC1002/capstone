1367371163.0	1dgad2	ESEA client basically a virus	NerdyFTW	900	123	430	"So the ESEA client would mine bitcoins on computers without the owners consent. http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492102 ESEA admins even admitted it.... I don't trust esea after this. 

/u/renalucario 's post in /r/games http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dglil/popular_competitive_gaming_league_esea_admins/ 

Note that this story is still developing:
ESEA Statement has been released! Full post at the bottom of this post or click here to read on esea.net
ESEA Member unisolsz discovered that the client required to play on ESEA was running a bitcoin miner. After players were complaining about virus alerts being set off from the client and unusually high GPU usage and BSOD errors.

The thread he made regarding this can be found here

ESEA admin, lpkane admits that it was an ""April Fools joke"" that was mistakenly left in the client that ran for only 2 days. He claims only 2 bitcoins were mined in total (Roughly around $280 USD) and that it would go towards a prize pool. Source

He later corrects that it was running for 2+ weeks and actually raised 29~ bitcoins (around $3,602.21 USD) and to apologize awarded all current ESEA premium members a free month of service and that all the money raised will go into the prize pool. He also claims that all bitcoin mining code was removed from the client. Source #2

Bitcoin miners use up 100% of GPU processes and lead to a lowered hardware lifespan, and can actually damage it permanently.

Link to /r/GlobalOffensive discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dgad2/esea_client_basically_a_virus/

UPDATE: Someone has pointed out that the bitcoin address that lpkane posted a picture of in his first post is different compared to the address he lists in his second post. Very strange...

UPDATE #2: I should clarify that no one that was affected lost any money of their own. It was a poor choice of words for me to say that he 'stole' the money. I was referring to the fact that people that were affected most likely saw an increase in electricity usage, and could possibly have had their computer's hardware damaged. Their computers were used without their consent to 'mine' currency, all of which went to the ESEA admins.

UPDATE #3: I was contacted by /u/GGTY886 that informed me that he had posted a thread regarding the mining two hours before unisolsz had posted his that was locked by an admin. Located here

There is also a thread located here by a user that discusses the symptoms of the miner.

He also sent me a recording of a conversation with an ESEA admin discussing the issue which can be listened to here: The Recording

His PM in full in case you're interested:
I actually posted a thread before unisolz that actually exposed the bitcoin mining. http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492064
I posted 2 hours before his thread, and my thread was locked.
Also, one day prior, this guy posted about the symptoms of the mining: http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=491845
recording with ESEA Admin: http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492190

UPDATE #4: Others have pointed out that this isn't the first time lpkane has mentioned mining bitcoins through the ESEA client: http://i.imgur.com/yvMX2DY.png
Source

UPDATE #5: In a thread dated 4/9/2013, lpkane posts in a thread discussing bitcoins:
and you wonder what the client does when you're not in a server..

UPDATE #6: If you've been affected by this, you can file a complaint to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): https://www.ic3.gov With this information:
E-Sports Entertainment, LLC 62 Rensselaer Drive, Commack, New York, 11725, 631-804-5253

UPDATE #7: Another image that was requested to be added to the OP showing lpkane's comments on bitcoin mining on September 18th, 2012. http://i.imgur.com/SrhyF8d.png

UPDATE #8: Craig Levine ""Torbull"" (owner of ESEA) has posted this statement on the forums regarding the situation:

The first I learned about any of this was last night (on any scale). I had no idea any of this was going on.
Needless to say I am completely embarrassed, disgusted, and ashamed.
For the past ten years, I've tried to do nothing more than to act honestly and be an upstanding leader in the gaming community and with some bad decisions by some trusted people it has been thrown out the window.
I'm wrapping my mind around this whole thing and we'll release a formal response, but for the time being just know that this wasn't some ESEA / company wide scam.
I'm committed to doing whatever possible to rebuild the trust we lost through this whole fiasco.
Source Post #608

Some more information from Craig:

Post #632:

It's a failure on my part to have the proper oversight to have prevented this from happening and it will be addressed.

My primary concern at this point is community trust and how that was destroyed. We need to understand the situation, take the appropriate action with those responsible for it, ensure we have things in place to prevent this from happening, and address anyone who incurred physical damages.

How we rebuild the trust of the community in the immediate aftermath and long term future is going to be a different discussion that we need to have as I walk through this all.

Post #710:

Standby for a more formal response with information about the situation and recourse for those impacted.

Post #742:

the facts of the situation are beyond what has been shared to this point.
We're going to do everything in our power to address the issue of what happened, the broken trust with the community, and any physical hardware damage. Information coming soon, but this is obviously something we take incredibly serious.

Post #802:

the money will be going somewhere much more righteous than the prize purse in addition to the prize purse

Post #810:

why would we risk our business and livelihood on making some inconsequential amount of money on Bitcoins
I assure you that I and the larger ESEA entity had no knowledge of this. We're working to figure out what happened to respond accordingly.

Post #829:

His (lpkane's) response there was done more playfully than seriously. We would never knowingly allow this to be done to our community and I'm looking into all of the details for how this happened.

Post #886:

We will be setting up a mechanism to address anyone who's computer parts were damaged through this process

UPDATE #9: /u/PrincessChoadzilla has posted a analysis of the three bitcoin addresses ESEA admins used to collect the bitcoins here and found that there has been 1 bitcoin that is still not accounted for by lpkane.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: ESEA Statement has been released:

Throughout the history of gaming and e-sports, there have been scams and straight up theft by players, teams, event organizers, and even “sponsors.” Over the past ten years ESEA has prided itself on being an upstanding member of the gaming community by providing a high quality service, paying out prize money, and being upfront and transparent with you, the community. We worked hard to build your trust and often took the longer, slower, and more meticulous road than others. That approach has paid off as we had success with our premium service and league. Over the two weeks we failed our community.

ESEA’s goal is to provide our community with cutting edge technology and tools. Whenever possible, the management and owners at ESEA initiate private tests on potential new products and tools that might interest our community. With the whole fervor around Bitcoin, we did conduct some internal tests with the Client on only two of our own, consenting administrators’ accounts to see how the mining process worked and determine whether it was a feature that we might want to add in the future. We thought this might be an exciting new tool that we could provide to our community. Ultimately, we decided that it was not.

On April 13, 2013, after the initial tests, ESEA informed those involved in the test that we were killing the project and they should stop using the beta test. It came to our attention last night, however, that an employee who was involved in the test has been using the test code for his own personal gain since April 13, 2013. What transpired the past two weeks is a case of an employee acting on his own and without authorization to access our community through our company’s resources. We are extremely disappointed and concerned by the unauthorized actions of this unauthorized individual. As of this morning, ESEA has made sure that all Bitcoin mining has stopped. ESEA is also in the process of taking all necessary steps internally to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.
The owners and management at ESEA all apologize to each of you that were impacted by the recent events and intend to make things right. ESEA has issued a free month of ESEA Premium to all of our community members who were enrolled in Premium for the month of April. We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket.

In an effort to maintain complete transparency, we have released all of the Bitcoin wallet addresses as well as data dumps of the wallets themselves. The value of the mined Bitcoins was $3,713.50 and ESEA will be donating 100% of the $3,713.55 to the American Cancer Society. ESEA will also match 100% of this amount for a total of $7,427.10 donated. ESEA is also increasing the Season 14 League prize pot by $3,713.50.
As a team, we work hard to create cool things and we’ve worked even harder to consistently do things the right way. While it’s incredibly disturbing and disappointing that this happened, we’re committed to improving ourselves and rebuilding trust with our community."	t5_2sqho	True

Man we had some great times together. Remember in 2001, when I was just 14 and we watched Trigun together? I downloaded a Vash the Stampede custom Deagle skin and in 1.3 we blew off more heads than I can count whilst our feet never touched the ground. We spent days just running and jumping, killing everyone in sight. You stole my heart the day we fell off bridge on Aztec and killed 2 CTs before we hit the ground. We were young and in love.

Remember those days in Source where any save round could be salvaged? There was a reason we called you the game changer in your prime. I'll never forget that one time we jumped down mid on de_contra and went for a swim down sewers killing 4 Cts before we crashed into B.

I told you not to take those steroids. ""But Waffles"", you told me, ""with this kind of fire power we need. You'll never complain about Mag7s or P90s on save rounds in CS:Go again."" I know, you did it for me, but we both knew the price you would pay. It was only a few weeks later you over dosed and were nerfed to hell. 

We haven't seen each other much since you went to shit, all haggard and drunk. Christ, you can't even shoot straight. You really need to pull yourself together. This is an intervention. All your friends love you. We miss you. And it is time you went to rehab. The game just isn't the same without you.

Anyway, I am sick of the maps.  I still have an absolute blast with CSGO and I have to say that I'm impressed with the amount of refinement we've seen thus far, especially matchmaking, but what CS desperately needs is well-done, beautiful, competitive maps.  I, like many others I'm sure, have a strong yearning for completely NEW competitive maps that have the same (if not better) aesthetic value as the new Valve maps.  I personally have lost interest in maps like mill and mirage because they just look so bland, and, IMO, one of the things CSGO needs most is more variety in the competitive map rotation.  How about a new take on an Oilrig-like setting?   A better office building DE_ map?  Asian city streets?  NY?  So many opportunities.  I am at work.  Can't waste any more time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the help of a bunch of community members we put together nice looking overviews with call-outs for the competitive map. The only map we are missing right now is mill, which continues to change and is not in its final release. The goal of this is to help new players, new teams, and puggers be on the same page. 

Links are below, and below those are the notes for each.

**A huge thanks to Latorr, Budi, mR. Waffles, Hatton, Nik, and my team.**

[Full Gallery](http://thegoshow.tv/map-call-spots/)

**Please note** that I did my best to provide the most common names for these spots. A lot of teams make up their own, and different regions have different names. I worked with a bunch of experienced community members, and polled members as well to find the most common.

**Map Notes**

Any call-out that is a light grey (instead of white) is underneath what the overlay is showing. For example ""Underpass"" on Mirage is underground and below where ladder room connects to catwalk, so it is light grey. Another example is CT Spawn on Dust2 being below Short A.

One spot on a few maps were not named by the many players we polled. We felt they were important calls, and ended up naming them ""close (direction)"" ie. Close Left on Dust2 in B. Close Left outside of T Ramp on Mirage.

Nuke's lower level is separated and accentuated on the bottom left of the image.

Season's overview was pulled from the map .dds file just as the others were, and unfortunately was not made professionally by Valve. It's a bit high contrast but should still suffice.

We only created overviews for the maps that are commonly played competitively. As more maps are completed, we will create new overviews.

**Dust2: Separated Catwalk, Cat, and Short A on purpose. Normally players call all 3 of those the same single name.** We felt it was important that the community start separating those, as there is a huge difference between someone on Short A near A Plat, and someone on Catwalk, just past ""Palm"", and players should be able to easily differentiate. ""Catwalk"" is named such because catwalks are usually thinner just as that area is. ""Cat"" breaks off from Catwalk. ""Short A"" is parallel to Long A, and is indeed shorter.
Added ""Cat Boost"".
Kept ""Palm"" despite the palm tree being removed in GO, as there was nothing there in 1.6, Barrel is used in other areas of the map, and e-pole sounds weird. Actually I kind of like it, you can use that if you want.
Had no solid name for ""B Boxes"". Used ""B Boxes as all other boxes in B were named, and it shares the naming convention with B Doors which is in close proximity. 
Side of Pit and Pit Plat didn't necessarily have names with anyone that we polled, but named them to keep this as comprehensive as possible.

**New Mirage:**
Separated Catwalk and B Cat.
Created E-Stairs to replace E-Box due to landscape change and to differentiate from E-Box at B.
Gave ""Van"" in B a new name as ""Crates"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.
Gave ""Cart"" at the top of middle a new name, as ""Green Box"" is unhelpful to newer players unfamilar with previous iterations of the map.

**Cache:**
B site's ""Corner"" was named instead of ""back site"" or ""deep site"" per the input of several competitive players.
Headshot Box is below Balcony in A, as shown by the light grey text.

**Inferno:**
""Mexican"" or ""Mexi-Pit"" were not used on purpose, and was replaced by ""Underpass"". Deal with it.
We opted to use several Source names as the maps in GO are very similar to Source when compared to 1.6.
""Tri-Box"" from 1.6 is named New Box as it was in Source.
""2nd"" is named 2nd instead of fruit, or oranges because there are no remnants of the source name.
""Patio"" is also Quad for many players.
""Close"" on arch side mid is Close left and had no name according to players we polled.
""Construction"" was chosen over ruins.
""Spools"" were chosen over spindles or coils. We used Spools to stay consistent with other maps.
""Well"", and ""Terrace"" were unnamed previously.
T-Apartments go through to the kitchen area as well. These are low-action areas and are rarely called.
Separated Kitchen and Library.

**Nuke:**
As stated previously we outlined the very transparent lower routes / bomb site and put them in a key on the bottom left of the full image. The main section of the image holds the upper bomb site.
Locker is underneath the red roof that holds Heaven and Catwalk up.
Red is a general call on ramp, meaning down ramp. CT or T ""Red"" are when they are standing in or pushing through the left or right side of red, into lower. There is a catwalk that runs across perimeter of B. Call the catwalk and what is below the catwalk, for example ""Catwalk above Toxic"". Do the same for Rafters in Upper. ie. ""Rafters above Hut"", ""Rafters above Mini"".

**Train:**
A1, A2, and A3 were 4, 5, 6 in 1.6, but are now labelled in GO, and will be 1, 2,3. Some inner trains have been removed in GO, and thus we have removed the lane labels of 1,2,3, and given each train a name. Outside you can also call them 1-Train, 2-Train, 3-Train.
Boilers is also called as ""upper"" but was separated to be more specific.
Up ladder and down ladder can also be ladder room, but were named this way to specify.
Pop Dog was a 1.6 name, and is easier than ""Lower Train"".
E-box is also known as Electric.

**Season:** Green and Blue in the A site had different names, but we felt it would be smart to start using names that pertained to the new map, and are easier to remember."	t5_2sqho	True

If LoL, Dota, COD, and SC2 players are the lavish lands of the South and West, we are the Mongols of the North by now: fierce, prone to infighting amongst ourselves, sarcastic, and jaded with most offers of a surge in our Counter-Strike fortunes.  And continuously, we look for some mythical Genghis Khan to come over the fold and lead us on to mainstream eSports stardom: Valve, Twitch viewer numbers, ESEA, ad infinitum.

I don't know if this is the end of our Indian summer...or the beginning of something great.  But like the child who is not the apple of their parents' eye, but resourceful and successful on our own nonetheless, we still need that little loan to break into our own.  We need these appeals, not because we believe in a full-time CS:GO oriented Valve employee (which would most likely defy reason and probability), but because we need that voice in the night that says ""I hear.  I am here.""

I don't want to wake up with a Macedonian flag added into my game.  At least, if you must Valve, add it like one adds the spray tag after a kill: once the main work is done.  

There are a few core elements from the game missing, I won't repeat them for fear of inducing ad nauseum banality.  All we need is a promise, and we also need an understanding that you want to attract casual players but you also want to keep the game exhilarating, with a high skill ceiling and a respect for the intelligence and wits of the average competitive player.  I will stress one thing here that many don't: *movement.*  Seriously one of the largest fractals in the Counter-Strike vision has been diminished with GO, meaning that many talented movers and jumpers can't contribute to the realm of competitive play.

Anyways, I expound in excess.  Valve, we need you like Achilles needed Patroclus, or Aeneas needed his *fidus Achates*, there to support our growth and lend the few fixes needed."	t5_2sqho	True

After thinking about doing League of Legends, I decided to do it on Counter-Strike, which was my first competitive game. I want to mainly focus on the professional and amateur competitive scenes, and interview a wide range of players. I'm looking for the following players who are comfortable on camera, discussing the game for them.

I'll be looking for the following: 

* People who made it professionally and are currently playing professionally
* Teams that are trying to become professionals
* People who have committed to trying to go pro and have failed
* People who have just recently decided to try and go pro
* An amateur team that is content with just doing amateur tourneys
* A team manager 

The main questions will be related to the sacrifices and struggles people have made to try and play professionally in the world of eSports, as well as showing the rest of the community. And yes, I'll be mentioning reddit in some light.

Thanks for taking the time to read guys, if you're interested in helping this project, please PM me on here. I will also do my best to answer any questions you may have. "	t5_2sqho	True

If it's ticked, the POV recording would be made immediately available and saved to disk. The server would then make the GOTV demo available for download, and Steam would download it if the player is not in a game. 

There have been so many clutches or ninjas that I wish I recorded, and this would solve the problem without automatically saving every demo, which takes up exorbitant amounts of disk space. 

A GUI could be added along side the current statistics information to look at all of your previous match recordings, and be able to analyse where you can improve.

This, along side a debug and redesign of the demo playback interface to be more intuitive and not require the console. 

What do you guys think about this auto-recording idea?

1373208970.0	1hsxx0	Better But Balanced Deagle - Please Help Us Get Valve's Attention	RDno1	225	50	118	"In [this](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3145603) thread on the Steam CS:GO forum, we have tried to create a Deagle based on the collective feedback of the community that is more fun to play with and less random but still balanced. I think we have already done it.
Here is the current version based on everybody's feedback (download it [here](http://www.fileswap.com/dl/GeO2Op2TIG/) )
Here are the values, why they were changed and how the changes relate to the other pistols:

* Damage: 63 -&gt; 40 (decreased because other parameters were tweaked for better accuracy - still best of all the pistols)
* RangeModifier: 0.81 -&gt; 0.92 (increased to guarantee headshot kills at long range - best of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyStand: 7.70 -&gt; 5.70 (decreased for better long range hs and to match with other pistols - third best of the pistols)
* InaccuracyJump: 1.966 -&gt; 0.966 (decreased to match other pistols values - still worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyLand: 0.770 -&gt; 0.330 (decreased to match other pistols values - still worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyFire: 72.23 -&gt; 150.23 (increased this value - will add inaccuracy when SPAMMING fire button - by far the worst of all the pistols)
* InaccuracyMove: 48.10 -&gt; 26.10 (increased mobility because we should use it not only while standing and to match other pistols - still worst of all the pistols)
* RecoveryTimeCrouch: 0.489927 -&gt; 0.42 (decreased because the recoil took too long to reset - still second worst of all the pistols)
* RecoveryTimeStand: 0.8912 -&gt; 0.46 (decreased because the recoil took too long to reset - still of all the pistols)
* RecoilAngleVariance: 60 -&gt; 30  (reduces angle variance in recoil magnitude - still second worst of all the pistols - Note that this is a buff, not a nerf. The recoil angle varies less in this version -&gt; less random)
* RecoilMagnitudeVariance: 18 -&gt; 11 (reduces variance in recoil magnitude - still worst of all the pistols - Note that this is a buff, not a nerf. The recoil angle varies less in this version -&gt; less random)

It also has 
the best WeaponArmorRatio,
the worst WeaponPrice, 
the worst ClipSize and 
the worst CycleTime values.
You can see that it is definitely not overpowered.

Below are the exact damage values for it:
range 128 units (3 hit kill):
39 no kevlar chest
48 no kevlar lower body
45 kevlar lower body
36 kevlar chest

range 256 units (3 hit kill):
38 no kevlar chest
47 no kevlar lower body
35 kevlar chest
44 kevlar lower body

range 512 units (3 hit kill):
36 no kevlar chest
45 no kevlar lower body
34 kevlar chest
42 kevlar lower body

range 1024 units(3-4 hit kill):
33 no kevlar chest
42 no kevlar lower body
31 kevlar chest
39 kevlar lower body

range 2048 units (3-4 hit kill)
28 no kevlar chest
35 no kevlar lower body
26 kevlar chest
33 kevlar lower body

1 headshot kill range with armor: 2395 units
1 headshot kill range without armor: 2818 units
(basically any range)

For comparison:
128 units = Quarter long A on de_dust2: http://i.imgur.com/oLUTA9n.jpg
512 units = Half long A on de_dust2:

Files and info:
You can test it [only in offline mode], all you need to do is download the file and replace it in the ""csgo/scripts"" folder (don't forget to make a backup file copy and to put it back before you play online again or you will be kicked from servers).

Credit to micronn(aka majkelDre) for most of this post!

These values might be adjusted some more but the idea behind it is this:
We reduced the damage so that it is a 3 hit kill at close range and 3-4 hits at long range against armored opponents. The 1 headshot kill range is very long however and the inaccuracy when standing has been reduced to give better accuracy on the first shot while also reducing the insane recovery time to make it viable and to allow for multiple headshots again (it's still hard though). Spamming mouse1 with it is not rewarded because the InaccuracyFire is so high.

This Deagle is great for precisely aimed headshots at any range, but still definitely not overpowered due to the low damage (and still huge recoil and recovery time.) It takes good aim to use it, but it is rewarding.

Everybody please head over to the Steam Forum thread, post your feedback and rate it 5 stars even if you don't agree 100%, so we can get Valve to tweak the Deagle.

Thanks!

Update: Here is a video of me testing the accuracy because people are concerned about added randomness due to the InaccuracyFire increase: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W4x3VhvW84
You can see that the randomness is only significant when you spam the fire button. 
IMPORTANT: This effect is negligible at a closer range and is NOT worse than the current Deagle due to the reduction of the recoil variance(randomness) and the decrease in inaccuracy when standing or moving in this version! This version is actually LESS random/MORE accurate when standing still/moving and at low rates of fire. Max accuracy is also regained significantly faster."	t5_2sqho	True

Smudded	209	45	106	"As you're all aware, ESEA has recently betrayed the trust of their entire user base by using their anti-cheat client to mine Bitcoins. The response here on Reddit has been overwhelmingly against ESEA and I'm sure many of you have unsubscribed from the service. Unfortunately, this hasn't been the response from the old school/pro CS players in the competitive scene. They have been around a long time and seen a lot of shady things, so to them this is no surprise. The way they see it is that ESEA has done a lot for CS in the past, so they're willing to let even this massive, criminal action slide. They mostly don't seem to care or realize that this scandal is forever going to hinder the growth of the game if it is the only way to play competitively. New players won't be giving their money or computers over to an organization like ESEA. Nor should they.

So what's the solution? In order for the CS community to grow to its full potential we need an alternative, but building a system like ESEA from the ground up will take an entire team of people dedicated to the community multiple months of full time work to get off the ground. Aside from even just a time commitment this is also a huge monetary commitment. Where is this money going to come from? With such a small community it will be hard to garner big dollar sponsors. Not to mention that the alternative most likely won't have support from the old school/pro players at the start as many of them are complacent in their abusive relationship with ESEA. Ultimately, what does this all mean?

**Valve must step in and invest the time and money to create a quality system to replace ESEA**. Surely they must see after this whole fiasco that they can no longer trust their competitive scene to third parties. Maybe they're working on this, and in general they've been pretty quiet about their plans for the game, so it's quite possible that they've been working on it from the start. It seems to make some sense that many of the more simple game play fixes and tweaks have been delayed due to work being done on some larger aspect of the game. This is the only guaranteed path I see to ensure the growth and long term success of CS:GO.

To be clear, I'm not saying that an alternative cannot work. In fact, I would love to work on an alternative myself. I'm a front end software engineer working for a large web app, so if someone needs some help in that area I'm willing to spend a lot of time on this.

Anyways, this post was made halfway to satisfy my own need to rant, but I think it's very important that we get this in front of Valve's face as much as possible. They are ultimately responsible for the development of the competitive aspect of this game."	t5_2sqho	True

It was a hot day on de_dust2 and like the map my body was hot, partly because I chose to play as arctic avenger and partly because of the new guy. His name was [MLG]1337_SMOKE420, unlike my previous lovers I did not see him as another sextoy for fast analpleasure.

I did feel even more for him than for [love2camp], who so gently pumped my shotgun.

Just as the round started [MLG]1337_SMOKE420 instantly cought my attention as he  sniped a guy hard at middle double doors. Quickly the team decided it would be best to rush B and like a fist crushes into a asshole we took control of the bombsite.

[MLG]1337_SMOKE420 planted the bomb, giving me a good view of his wonderful formed ass. At this moment I could not resist any longer, i unzipped my whitecamouflage pants and walked up to[MLG]1337_SMOKE420 and smacked my junk into his face.

Slowly and truely masterful he began sucking. Even the last CT was unable to do something else than admire this example of manlove. The only words that came across his seweet lips were: ""WTF kind of mod is this?""

And just as the bomb exploded, time stood still and I came, I penetrated double doors and jerked until CT spawn, in this very minute Gaben appeared and everything went silent, I was not even able to hear [MLG]1337_SMOKE420 masturbate while licking cum.


and the following is what Gaben said:""You, ...."", (a short pause because he ate a piece of pizza) ""have clearly won this game, I shall give you Half-Life 3"" 

and as he finished the this sentence a DVD appeared in a puddle of my cum and HL3 was written upon it, as the DVD appeared Gaben dissapeared.

This was the most glorious day of my life.

1373524723.0	1i2dpg	Valve, it's time to remove aim punch from chest damage without armor.	csgothrowaway	194	35	115	"Valve has come a long way in listening to our feedback in these past few weeks with CS:GO and I think one of the few things that makes CS:GO feel a bit random is they aren't working on is the aim punch.  They've remade nuke, addressed the 2 flashes, balanced the flashbang, adjusted the recoil, balanced guns like the mag7, removed the fog, made apartments on inferno wider, balanced the smoke and now they seem to be addressing the ADADAD issue and a lot of these were updates and changes inspired by the community and for all the whining hltv.org does about Valve, I think it says a lot about them that they listen to the community and I'm most certainly grateful but it's time for aim punch from unarmored chest damage to go.  

In a patch a while ago they made it so aim punch only affects unarmored and hits in the chest which was a nice change that made the game more consistent but I don't think its enough.  1 on 1 battles are ruined in this game because whoever has armor practically wins before the figth even starts and if they both don't have armor, the first person who lands a shot wins, which is boring to watch and frustrating, especially on those pistol rounds where you're trading blows from across the map.(being that CT window guy on mirage on pistold round that gets shot once in the chest and has to deal with the random aim and has to pretty much retreat is very frustrating)

I think aim punch should only be a thing if you don't have head armor and you get gooshed but it should be much more temporary than it is right now and I'd almost argue a goosh should forcefully move your crosshair rather than change your recoil without providing any feedback to the player that their shots are now in a random state.  I mean that's really just one of the issues of aim punch is that **people don't even *know* they are being aim punched.**  Its hard enough to see where your bullets are going so instead of even knowing that aim punch is causing them to miss, they blame the server registration or they blame the recoil in the game.  But that doesn't make aim punch fair.  It just means its an issue that's hard to even notice.

Aim punch should not be a regular occurrence because it just makes any fight without armor a bit more random and it makes armor far too important.  The days of weighing our money and figuring out whether we can afford to play without armor so that we can buy more nades are over.  That 3k-3.5k buy on T side isn't as viable because if you don't have armor, you're practically forfeiting any 1 v 1 with anyone that can land a chest shot.

So I'm really just hoping here that Valve, as in the previous updates, at least considers that they can make the game more consistent, more skill based, if they reduce aim punch to only getting gooshed without head armor.  Thanks."	t5_2sqho	True

Dont make self posts asking for ESEA trials, game keys or other similar things.

##4. RACISM AND HATE
Did you get coupled with a team from another part of the world that pinged over 500? Nothing wrong with feeling frustrated, but keep it civil; racist comments are a bannable offense.

##5. OTHER GAMES
This subreddit is about CS:GO and CS:GO only, posts about Counterstrike 1.6 and CSS have their own respective subreddits. 

##6. MEMES / IMAGE MACROS
Generic image macros like scumbag steve and confession bears are not allowed (as is the norm in most gaming subreddits).

##7. SERVER ADVERTISING 
Random comments similar to ""come and play on &lt;ip&gt;"" in a thread named ""CS:GO Update 29/05/2013"" are not allowed and will be removed. As long as it's relevant to the subject, server advertising is ok. 

*An easter egg for those of you that read all the rules: A huge subreddit update is hopefully coming later today, fixing the streaming section and adding realtime HLTV match news*

That means this subreddit is going to probably double, maybe even triple its subscribers in a few weeks (that is being optimistic). 

For a very long time, I've noticed that CS players are very...old school, to put it lightly. Many of us have been playing the game for over a decade, and if you haven't? Well, GG Noob. Learn to play. We're about to get an influx of people who have never stepped foot into a competitive (at least, CS competitive) FPS arena. If we aren't halfway amicable, this game will absolutely eat them alive -- be it the actual game or community. 

I'm talking basic things like recoil patterns and ""peeking"" will be totally and completely new to many of the new players. We've gotta really step back and realize they may actually not have any concept of the ideas we've been playing with for 10+ years. 

On more housekeeping notes, are the moderators ready for a swarm of self posts? Maybe we should change the banner if it is F2P to include a button or something that reads ""CLICK HERE IF YOU'RE NEW TO CS!""

In terms of accuracy and damage, the M4A1-S compares best with the famas or galil. While famas has a smaller clip, it has a high reserve, and while galil has a larger clip, it also has a fairly hefty reserve. This allows for both guns to be used to cover, as well as terminate without much fear of running out of ammo.

The USP doesn't compare well with any T pistol, and best with the p2k. But during pistol round, we'll examine the defaults, glock with 140 bullets total to utilize while the USP is left with 36 total. This becomes an extremely tactical problem when attempting to identify (via test or cover fire) where terrorists are hiding or pushing while terrorists have a very obvious spam advantage.

We performed most recent tests with the author of this reddit thread, him and me connected to his server:
http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1dueje/stutterrubber_banding_still_torturing_me/
and here's what we observed.

**Test configuration**
His 128-tick server running dust2_se, competitive minspec turned off, net_graph 5
Both of us have cl_updaterate 128, cl_cmdrate 128, rate 80000, fps consistently exceeding 150 fps
Upstream and downstream bandwidth sufficiently greater than 15 KB/s, loss and choke at 0%
One player in the test runs along Long A area, other player observes the movement of the runner.

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 0**
This results in server movement control feature being turned off similar to how it was in the pre-May build.
DustyWJ running Long A: On his screen he moves smoothly while running. On my screen he moves 5-8 steps, then teleports the width of A-ramp box, then moves smoothly another 5-8 steps, then teleports the width of A-ramp box, and so on.
When I am running Long A I see myself running smoothly on my screen and he sees me running smoothly on his screen.

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 3**
This results in server movement control allowing for 3/128th of a second fluctuations in client's command stream = 23 ms ping fluctuations.
DustyWJ running Long A: On his screen he stutters back every several steps. On my screen he moves 1-2 steps, then briefly stops for a frame or two as if he hits backpedal to make an accurate shot at an enemy, then moves 1-2 steps, brief stop, and so on.
When I am running Long A I see myself running smoothly on my screen and he sees me running smoothly on his screen.

**sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks 36**
This results in server movement control allowing for 36/128th of a second fluctuations in client's command stream = 280 ms ping fluctuations.
This is the borderline value for DustyWJ running Long A and not seeing himself stuttering back. On my screen he teleports the width of A-ramp box just as in the case of having the convar value set to 0.
280 ms x 250 units/sec knife movement speed = 70 in ~= 6 feet (~2 meters) of in-game distance of teleportation.
Any value lower than 36 will have DustyWJ observe slight stuttering and his net_graph 5 in bottom section will spike into red when stutter occurs. Also as the value gets reduced down from 36 I will be seeing his character teleporting shorter distances on my screen.

**Summary**
Any non-zero value for the convar up (e.g. 256) will eliminate ""speedhacking"" because clients will not be able to stuff in more than, in this example, 2 seconds of malicious movement commands.

The maximum teleportation distance that a player with poor network routing will achieve is mathematically equal to ( (sv_maxusrcmdprocessticks / tickrate) x MovementSpeed ) and server operators are free to configure servers to optimize for maximum teleporting distance their players and/or league can tolerate.

It was unfortunate that the most recent update found many people not having a sufficient network connection to maintain the required packet frequency for the servers, but if clients are unable to consistently deliver packets at a rate required for the server tickrate, we believe that it would be unfair to put all enemy players who have consistent network connection at a disadvantage. We however provide the settings for sever operators and league administrators to configure their servers as required.

The upcoming Wednesday update will increase the default value of the convar to 16 allowing a default experience of max 2.6ft (~80 centimeters) teleportation on 128-tick servers and thus arriving at a good default compromise for people not to stutter on local clients and not to cause too much teleporting from enemies' perspective as their network latency conditions or packet drops fluctuate by +125 ms. All Valve servers will also have the settings providing an equivalent movement restriction in 64-tickrate conditions.

DustyWJ will be running some traces to pinpoint which piece of his network between his client and his server was causing networking hitches and hopefully will be able to share some information with the community.

I hope this answers a lot of questions that the community had after the most recent update and provides some technical details about tickrate and latency to help server administrators understand the details of how these settings affect players.

1367016696.0	1d6nei	Competitive Community Wishlist	FrooshGOShow	178	33	90	"There have been some really great posts on this sub-reddit in the past 24 hours (ie. [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1d5och/the_future_of_cs_in_light_of_operation_payback_an/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1d4k33/why_i_like_operation_payback/).), really coming to the defense of Valve, allowing for some really great conversation.

I thought it might be nice to create a collective wishlist for the competitive global offensive scene. The bullet points below are written as suggestions, not complaints. I love playing GO at its current state, but have ideas for improvements

**Please feel free to comment and add your thoughts, I will add to the list as I see the comments.**

**Wishlist**

* **""Tournament Standard"" applied to MM** - Matchmaking is a fantastic idea, but as we've experienced, it needs to be done right for it to be a viable option for players to practice and grow. It's been said in 1,000 threads already, but the tournament standard would be, 128 tic, 2 flashes, 1:45 round timer, _se maps, and a larger map pool with new maps and classic re-made maps when they are ready. In addition to the tournament standard, we would like to see the ability to re-fill an abandoned spot, NOT A KICKED SPOT. We don't want this abused, but if a teammate has to go, or has connection issues, we should be able to re-fill that spot mid-scrim. This would mean that if you queued as 5 players, only a ""friend"" can join that team, and be invited via steam friends by any player on that team. If it was a pug 5, then allow any single queued player to have the option to join an ""already in progress"" game.

* **Brand New Competitive Maps** - Beta test and make changes based on pro/high level feedback. You can make a new map for MM, and if it's good map it will be adopted by other platforms/leagues. I think there is a HUGE demand for this from the casual and competitive scene.

* **Revamped Replay/Demo System** - I think this isn't discussed enough, and it's undervalued. It would be great to have an option to auto-record demos every scrimmage, and name them based on date/time so none are overwritten. Would be great to have the ability to watch a demo with multiple people on your friends list. Optimized rewind, fast forward, potentially allowing you to pick which round to skip to. It would also be nice to be able to pause a demo, and still use freelook and other functions. I understand there is NO way the current demo system could handle that, but that's why it needs to be remade/revamped. GOTV was a huge improvement, but the demo system needs more improving. We don't have enough content creators doing analysis, and most of the analysis that is done is not very good, including my own, and I believe it's because the demo system makes it near impossible to be efficient. More content means a more involved community, both of which bring in more gamers to the community, which brings higher viewership at tournaments and events, which means more sponsors and tournaments that are interested in GO.

* **Gun Updates** - I don't think I need to go into a lot of detail about this, but these are strictly my opinion, I know people will disagree. I think the p2000 needs a buff in some way, I understand that CT's have less powerful guns for a reason, it's not a viable option for CT's (especially if you keep the Glock how it is now, and I actually love the glock right now). I'm not going to say anything about the deagle. I think the P90 needs any ONE of the following - needs to be more expensive, or needs to lower the kill reward, or needs to be nerfed with shooting speed, or damage.

* **Minor HUD changes** - The visibility of alive/dead players, current weapon/bomb on your character, and round timer needs to improve. I don't have many good suggestions for this, possibly allow us to change the opacity, and allow us to customize where each HUD component is placed.

* **VAC changes** - We all know there are cheaters in this game, I have 0 suggestions to make this better, but improvements would be nice.

**Added from comments**

* More organized, better GUI for spectating matches. I don't want to take views away from Twitch, but from what i've seen (i do not play) Dota 2 has a good replay system where you can watch replays from other matches that you didn't play in, and view statistics on that match. (someone who plays dota2 please comment!) - watchspade

* Minor Mag7 nerf. It's great to have a gun that gives you a chance on eco rounds, but with current play the % for anti-eco losses is a bit too high. - xfake

* Reduce weapon-switch time - xfake

* Remove scope blur - xfake

* More MM servers in more locations - breul99

* Improve VAC by Valve downloading the cheats, understanding how they work, and ban users. - pleomax_b

* Aim-punch and smokes going through solid walls need fixing - dfoxcs

Things I left out on purpose

* ADADAD - Because there is discussion that it's the same as any bug we abused in 1.6 and source. I bet if crouch jumping never existed in 1.6, and it was a bug in GO, people would hate on it the way they hate on ADADAD

* The Deagle - Because sometimes I can't tell whether I hate it because it sucks, or I hate it because I don't know how to control it yet. It blows my mind that our community puts ourselves on a pedestal over other FPS communities because we say ""this game takes skill"", yet we complained about recoil changes from day 1. Should we be learning this game instead of complaining about how it's different from what we learned 10 years ago? Same thing with the smaller hitboxes in GO.

* Silencers - Because there is more to it than ""it takes an hour to code this"". It's about balance, and radar, and the fact that it's simply something you miss, not something that will help the community grow."	t5_2sqho	True

1373165503.0	1hs7ci	Possible new movement values	m0rd0ck	170	28	148	"Hey guys, here I am with another one of these threads in hope that this time we can stand by each other and make our voices be heard...

You might remember about J3DI trying to do something like this a couple of months ago at cadred.

He couldnt reach a consensus with the pro community as they had very different views of how movement should be handled.

He did however say at the SPUF that the community should try and come up with some values and approach valve with them when we reached an agreement of what the best values are.

After a couple of failed attempts, we were finally a handfull of guys, trying to get this right.

We started by just trying to make GOs movement feel good, but in some cases it turned out to be sluggish, so, instead of throwing numbers into the air and hoping they worked, we decided to get one of the previous games movement acceleration curve.

we turned to 1.6 for inspiration, just because it feels good to move around.

we managed to get both 1.6 and GOs acceleration curve, to see how they compared.

After that we got 1.6 movement down, but, we also got some alternatives. we came up with 4 final combinations of values

You can check the movement acceleration curve of every combination and a quick analysis bellow

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7uwC6JTkveudW5SZmFSYW5INDg/

-Compared to 1.6,GO accelerates faster not only initially but all the way to 250 units.

1)sv_friction 4.5 | sv_accelerate 4.8 gets the initial acceleration values right but then takes too long to reach full speed.(green line on the graphic)

2)sv_friction 4.9 | sv_accelerate 5.35 is in-between GO and 1.6, very early on being closer to GO than 1.6 and then accelerating slower than both close to 210 units.(purple line on the graphic)

3)sv_friction 4 | sv_accelerate 5 is the one closer to 1.6, its a bit faster all the way, but its pretty close overall.(light blue line on the graphic)

4)sv_friction 4 | sv_accelerate 4.6, this curve looks like its 1.6 at the beginning but then it gets similar go GOs about halfway.(orange line on the graphic)


You have the values and the graphical representation of them.

all its left is for you guys to test it out, and give feedback, its up to you now.


Give them a try and share your thoughts...we got to do this together if we want to be heard...

regards to everyone

1345816013.0	yr4d5	Tutorial: Using a spray in CS:GO	Vitate	161	21	93	"Hello Reddit, here's a quick tutorial I made on using a spray for CS:GO. If you have any questions or problems you run in to, feel free to say something in the comments! 

**Putting a spray in your CS:GO folder**

* First off, you need to navigate to this location in your steam folder:
   
&gt;\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike GlobalOffensive\csgo\materials\vgui\

* Make a folder named ""logos"". 

* You need to get a .vtf spray image to put into the logos folder. You can find one on FPS Banana or make your own. 

* After you do that and once you’re in game, go to console (~) and enter this:

&gt;bind ""t"" ""cl_playerspraydisable 0; impulse 201""


Note: ""t"" is the key you use to bind the spray. Whatever you bind it to should be your new spray key in-game.


This last line is vital to your spray working properly. Make sure you type what the name of your spray is in the &lt;sprayname&gt; field when you enter this into the console.

&gt;cl_logofile ""materials/vgui/logos/&lt;sprayname&gt;.vtf""




**To make your own spray**

* Open Photoshop or any similar program. Create a blank 256×256 RGB 8-bit image.
* Fill this image with mid-grey R 128, G 128, B 128.
* Create a new layer on top of this, and draw / add whatever you want to it. Delete from this layer any bits you want to be transparent in the final spray image
* Press CTRL and click the layer you’re drawing on in the layers palate. This selects only what you’ve drawn onto the layer.
* On the Channels tab, click the second button from the left to “Create alpha channel from selection”.
* Go back to the layers tab. Click Layer-&gt;Flatten Image.
* Now save the image as a TGA file, make sure Alpha Channels is ticked, hit OK and select “32 bit” when the dialog box pops up.
* Open VTF Edit. Go to File-&gt;Import and select your TGA file. (If you don’t have VTF Edit, download it [here]( http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/files/files/vtfedit125-11.exe))
* In the dialog that appears, un-check “Generate Mipmaps” and leave everything else default. Alpha Format should read ‘DXT5′. Hit OK.
* To confirm that your TGA alpha map worked okay, you can check View-&gt;Mask, which should turn on the alpha map preview
* Go to File-&gt;Save As and save the file. It is now ready to be placed in the ""logos"" folder you have previously created in your CS:GO folder.


EDIT: [As VinnieLDN pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/yr4d5/tutorial_using_a_spray_in_csgo/c5y5rqi), you can use [this](http://code.google.com/p/spraygen/) simple program to convert a .gif into a .vtf file.

This was a really tough contest, and we had a lot of really great entries. Some of you are incredibly entertaining poets. 

The winning entry is [this one by daazninvazn](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1gdo4a/csgo_haiku_contest_winner_gets_a_qck_mousepad/caj7n32). It was a close call between him and [this entry by iloveyousarge](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1gdo4a/csgo_haiku_contest_winner_gets_a_qck_mousepad/caj7nay) which was a super close second.

I chose Daazninvazn for 2 reasons: 1. His use of the one-letter-per-syllable was very clever and 2. His focused more on a topic related to CS:GO as opposed to CS in general. I will definitely be doing another contest very soon because this was a lot of fun. What type of prizes would you be interested in? Gooseman enjoyed the contest and I could do another one with mousepads, but let me know if anyone else has some ideas :]

Thanks for all the great entries!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


One of the leetway winners didnt claim his prize so now I'm doing a [Haiku](http://video.about.com/poetry/How-to-Write-a-Haiku-Poem.htm) contest. I choose the winner on Sunday. 

The Haiku must be about CS:GO

The Haiku must be in typical 5-7-5 syllable format. 

Example:

I die reloading

Fucking beautiful, isn't it?

One more thing:

This post needs 50+ upvotes. I don't care about the Karma, but the last contest was downvoted like crazy to attempt to hide it so less people entered it. I'm doing this for the community, fun, and at my own expense so let's all have a good time :]

1344935762.0	y7156	Autoexec.cfg for CS:GO	Whoreadswhoreads	168	33	144	"So, since the beta is coming up for pre-order-players, I thought about gathering some basic commands for a CS:GO cfg to optimize your gaming experience. Just post suggestions with descriptions and I'll add them to this post.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**BASIC FAQ**

---------------------------------------------------------------
**What is an autoexec.cfg?**

The autoexec is basically a list of commands run at the start of Counter-Strike. Autoexec = *Auto*matically *exec*uted.

**How do I create an autoexec?**

First you go to *\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\*. In this cfg-folder you create a new text document (.txt) and change it from ""New Text Document.txt"" to ""autoexec.cfg"". Done!

**How do I edit the autoexec.cfg?**

Right-click on the autoexec.cfg and click ""Open with..."" and select ""notepad"" under Other programs. Now you can easily add new commands to the cfg. Click File -&gt; Safe whenever you're done.

**How do I get the console to show up in CS:GO?**

It's basically the same as in CSS. Open your Steam Library, right-click on ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"", click on ""Properties"", in the upcoming window on ""SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."" and write ""-console"" (without the """") in the text-field. After that you just have to click ""Ok"", ""Close"" and start CS:GO.

**Help! The autoexec isn't executed on startup!**

This seems to be a known problem with no ""works everytime"" solution yet. You can try out to either:

a) execute the autoexec by entering the command ""exec autoexec"" (without the """") in your console. (thanks, wAvelulz!)

b) enter all commands into your config.cfg instead of your autoexec.cfg.

c) put the command ""exec autoexec"" (again without the """") at the end of your config.cfg. (thanks, highlatency!)

d) add ""+exec autoexec"" to the launch options (with console activated it should read ""-console +exec autoexec""). (thanks, ohgodthecat!)

---------------------------------------------------------------

**USEFUL AUTOEXEC COMMANDS:**

---------------------------------------------------------------

^((text following ""//"" is ignored in the autoexec. The upcoming text can be copied 1:1 into your autoexec.cfg.)^)

**r_drawtracers_firstperson 0**

// removes tracers following your own fire. Other players' tracers will not be affected.

**viewmodel_fov ""65""**

**viewmodel_offset_x ""2""**

**viewmodel_offset_y ""2""**

**viewmodel_offset_z ""-2""**

// repositions the gunmodel to mimic CSS more closely. The range of viewmodel_fov is 54 to 68, 60 is default. (thanks, ch4os1337!)

**cl_viewmodel_shift_left_amt ""0""**

**cl_viewmodel_shift_right_amt ""0""**

// removes the shifting of the arm when crouching down.

**cl_bob_lower_amt ""0""**

**cl_bobamt_lat ""0""**

**cl_bobamt_vert ""0""**

// removes the bobbing of the weapon back and forth, when you run.

**cl_bobcycle ""2""**

// causes the scope to move less when moving scoped in and reduces bobbing effect (thanks, Excessive1!)

**snd_mixahead ""0.05""**

// lowers delay between sounds.


**cl_interp ""0""**

**cl_interp_ratio ""2""**

**rate ""80000""**

**cl_cmdrate ""128""**

**cl_updaterate ""128""**


// sets interpolation and rate values. The five commands above insure an optimial connection to game servers you join. Rate ""80000"" is default - you can also experiment with rate ""128000"" and other values higher than 80000. The lerp-value in your net_graph should be white (not yellow/orange/red!). If it isn't, change the value of cl_interp_ratio. (thanks, Xpariah, Kiloswiss and ghostofmybrain!)

**net_graph ""3""**

**net_graphpos ""2""**

**net_graphheight ""0""**

// shows a netgraph on the screen with useful information about fps, ping and lerp. *IMPORTANT: net_graph is considered a cheat in most leagues, so don't include that if you're considering playing competitively.* (thanks, ghostofmybrain!)

**cl_righthand ""1""**

// insures your weapon is in your right hand. For 1.6 players who want their weapon in the left hand the command would be cl_righthand ""0"".

**cl_autoweaponswitch ""0""**

// disables automatic switch to a more powerful weapon when it is picked up.

**hud_scaling ""0.90""**

// changes the size of the HUD (Heads Up Display - ammo, health, radar, etc.). Hud_scaling ""1"" is maximum. (thanks, Xpariah!)

**mm_session_max_ping 50**

// sets your maximum allowable ping in your matchmaking. (thanks, Sir_Paul and chmod-007-bond!)

**cl_downloadfilter all**

// sets your options on what downloads you allow from a server: all, none, or  nosounds (thanks, Sir_Paul!)

**echo ""autoexec.cfg loaded.""**

// shows a message that the autoexec was successfully loaded in your console. (thanks, Xpariah!)

This is by no means confirmed by Valve but I personally feel like it could be an excellent investment by them.
The fps-scene is just laying there waiting for somebody to grab it, a huge tournament like this could really stimulate the scene.

Sure it won't be as big as its dota2 counterpart, but with a prize pool of, say, $200,000 it will still be [the major tournament of the year](http://www.hltv.org/news/11030-why-csgo-needs-major-events)

How can this be achieved? First, new operation to get things going. Bundle can consist of several MM maps made by valve (cbble, oilrig, prodigy, 747) and a brand new badge. 100% of the revenue goes directly to the prize pool.

Once the tournament is announced they should release csgo compendium with collectible player cards, predictions, dreamteams etc.

Next part is going to be controversial, so please read it up to the end before downvoting. At this point csgo should go F2P. Yes, *this sounds terrible* but it's the only way to bring masses into the game. All players who bought the game by then *will get compendium free of charge*, and **the matchmaking will be limited to the compendium owners only** (this way reducing the amount of throwaway cheating accounts).

With the increased playerbase more players will watch the tournament, thus increasing the audience which is so important for the sponsors.

It's almost sad really, but I have such an emotional investment and attachment in this community that this recent ESEA news makes me feel a lot of things.

I feel betrayed. I feel angry. Most of all, I feel.... unsurprised.

You see, I've never been a huge fan in ESEA. I have always respected the service, but the support and administration has been polluted for years. As CS:GO began growing in numbers in the last quarter of 2012 I recognized ESEA for what it is: a monopoly. As an entrepreneur and relatively business-savvy person I knew this was not a good thing for the community. 

Monopolies rarely work out to the favor the market. Around September I began playing with the idea of challenging ESEA's monopoly as a free alternative. I was willing to invest money into a project that could and would combat ESEA's market share and dominant hold on the community. Unfortunately, I got distracted and the idea lost steam. The largest barrier I found to enter the market was the anti-cheat.

This free service could compete on almost every level of ESEA. Better administration, enforced rules, trolls are able to be removed because they don't cost anything to remove, and comparable server quality to ESEA's service. Specifically, I could not find a developer with the ability and willingness to roll out a constant stream of AC updates. Of course, ironically, it was that same AC system that has become the bane of ESEA. These past 24 hours have been a bizarre roller coaster ride of investigation. I'm not here to talk about ESEA.

Apparently, someone else had the idea of a comparable contender to ESEA: Leetway.com. I have yet to use it, but the existence made me smile: someone had the same idea and they were smarter than I, they found a way to fill the AC problem that I could not. Whether it is as effective as ESEA I do not know.

So, for the community I have some questions:

1. What is stopping you from using Leetway? What can't they offer that ESEA does?

2. Do you think there's room for yet another pug/league/scrim service different from ESEA and Leetway? If so, do you want to make it happen?

This isn't a business pitch, these are genuine questions that I'd like to know the answer to. There are too many unanswered questions for ESEA at the moment, but I know we have a lot of different talents in this community and I truly believe if we, as active players, wanted to take command of the CS:GO competitive scene ourselves... we could.

It's just a matter of figuring out what you guys want."	t5_2sqho	True

1374180526.0	1il2sr	New Community movement Update!	m0rd0ck	135	17	100	"Hey guys,

Here's an update on the community movement.


Right now I'm working with a former CS:S Pro player on this. His name is Heffrey ""godFrey"" Brauer.

We are in contact with some sites to push the community initiative forward. This guy knows a lot of people from the different communities, and with his help everything is shaping up really nicely.

As you guys may remember, this movement initiative had feedback from Valve, and following Matt Wood's suggestion to expose this to the most people we can, The fallowing article will be featured on both HLTV and ESEA News, and its about the community work, check it out! ;)

you have the new values bellow in a chart
http://s15.postimg.org/7w3pxjgqj/movement.png


""Hello everyone,

I am Heffrey ""godFrey"" Brauer, and I have together with Luis ""M0rD0cK"" Chaveiro been working on some goals we've had with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Goals we have tried to reach by tweaking the movement values (sv_friction, sv_accelerate, sv_airaccelerate), which we now have after a lot of work. In this article we will break down each of our goals, explain why this is a problem, and how we fixed it.

Here are the new values:

sv_friction ""4.1""
sv_accelerate ""4.8""
sv_airaccelerate ""16""

Here is the list of goals we had:

1. Making movement acceleration more balanced, considering the new movement model (every weapon takes the same length of time to reach top speed).
2. Making acceleration more fitting to the scale of the world.
3. Balance peaking so it cannot be exploited due to increased acceleration, making holding angles more doable.
4. Making it easier for the eyes to recognize targets whilst moving.
5. Making tagging effect increased due to the lack of wallbanging aswell as the small hitboxes.
6. Maintaining the ability to jump the same lengths and heights as before despite the changes in acceleration (silo jump etc. still possible).


These were the goals, now we had to achieve them. This led to a lot of experimenting, testing and after a lot of time we have finally come to a set of values which achieves all of these goals. We will now go through each of the goals.


1: The thing about the new movement model is that only the top speed differentiates at the swap of a weapon, whilst the acceleration speed remains the same. So therefore we have made adjustments to the acceleration in order to balance this.


2: Considering the model size and the scale of the world/map, the acceleration is too rapid. We took a look at both Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source and we saw that the acceleration is much faster in CS:GO than in the previous mentioned. So keeping this in mind we figured that the acceleration should definately be lower than 1.6, considering the massive difference in player to world scale and also keeping the wallbanging in mind. In CS:S the acceleration is almost the same as 1.6, however this is justified by the bigger hitboxes and more manageable recoil. In order to fix this we reduced the acceleration to balance the movement, making it more fitting to the scale of the world.


3: With the current acceleration it is near impossible to hold angles and the peakers have a clear advantage due to the fast acceleration aswell as the mild tagging. Running around corners have never been easier aswell as getting away from a gunfire. In order to fix this we reduced the acceleration and the results were great. With the new values it is now much more doable to hold angles effectively, and the advantages has been balanced to make it a less biased game.


4: Accelerating fast also has another down side. When moving around a corner or out into a new open space, due to the fast acceleration there is a lot of things being exposed to your eyes at once. By reducing the acceleration, it becomes not only much more clear and pleasent for your eyes, but also makes it easier to recognize targets at long range as you come around a corner.


5: With fast acceleration, small hitboxes and lack of wallbanging, mild tagging is yet another thing to add on the list of advantages your target has, which helps him/her in the escaping of gunfire. To balance this, we have reduced the acceleration and with that follows increased tagging effect, resulting in a less biased and more balanced game.


6: Despite the fact that acceleration is reduced, the length and height of jumping is NOT affected and to answer your question beforehand, yes you can still do the silo jump and other jumps alike.


Movement is a major gameplay mechanic, it can't be too fast, nor too slow, and acceleration has to be just right so that other gameplay mechanics aren't compromised by it. Therefore we have approached this subject very seriously and we are confident that with these values, the game will be better. The change will provide more balance to the game, it will make it far more competitive and less ""random"" - Competitive because it opens up for more effective angle holding aswell with the different advantages granted by faster acceleration being removed, a more strategic approach is required. Worth mentioning is that Counter-Strike is a tactical shooter, not a fast paced shooter like Quake and others.


With the current CSGO settings you will need to be very observant and fast in order to pickup on all the things exposed to your eyes at once. With the new settings, reducing the acceleration, it is easier to react to and recognize targets as you move, whilst at the same time the action becomes smoother, also the exposure becomes more progressive rather than instant. By reducing acceleration it makes it harder to get away after you commit to peaking, and the increased tagging effect makes it near impossible to get away once you engage. This makes it once again possible to hold angles effectively and wont allow the peaker to exploit the advantages granted by fast acceleration, such as mild tagging, re-peaking at a rate faster than the majority's reactions and escaping.


To wrap things up I would like to say that this is far from the end of the journey. This is our final values and they are not subject to change. However we wont stop there, we will work as hard as we can on getting these values spread to the different communities and hopefully a big part of the CS:GO community will favor these to the current. We have been in contact with Matt Wood from Valve and received advice from him about this project to help us on our way, which also means that yes, Valve has their eyes on our project and progress.


As my final words I want to say that we are currently working on a concept for a tournament with CEVO (Cyber Evolution) and if everything goes well more information will come soon. I would like to thank Michal ""micron"" D. for his work on the spreadsheets we have put our past and current results in, also I would like to thank Brett ""Few"" S., Adam Spangler, Chris Pipher, Luis ""MIRAA"" Mira, Matt Wood, also big shout out and thank you to Ben ""SolobeN"" Farquhar for his help with the video and ofcourse, Luis ""M0rD0cK"" Chaveiro. Last but definately not least, on behalf of me and everybody involved with this project, we would like to thank the community and all of the players for your feedback and advice, keep it coming - the more the better!


Best regards,
Heffrey Brauer.""


best regards to everyone and thanks for the help, it was awesome, and we will be keeping you guys posted on everything ;)

The last one happened just now and is the reason why I'm making this post.

It's a good pug service I guess, but I'm currently not looking at it as such because of the lack of a real MMR/ELO ladder. Who thought it would be a good idea to give players the freedom to restart maps and scramble teams in competitive play?

sorry for the inconvenience! 

Edit4: name = Steamname

edit5: Would really appreciate if everyone sent their forms to YoBoiBokChoi@gmaill.com, it is much easier for me to organize from there instead of pages in reddit.

People are asking about region and servers, based on the amount of people looking to play on each, we can host multiple tournaments (NA only , EU only) both in the different regions.

would be pretty dick move of me to say we are going to have a EU tourney, and not enough people sign up for it so we have to cancel.

Send me the form to my email, and i will post all the info As soon as i can. 

Closing sign up on the 18th, so take your time and come back to check up on the post.

Thanks for the interest!

edit6: A little small announcement, it would seem that most people that have sent in their forms are

located in the NA/US regions, please, if you would a EU tourney to happen, let as many people as you know to send in their form to my email and PLEASE, stop posting the info in reddit, send it to my email so it is easier for me to organzie.
secondly i would need your opinions on this. People who by themselves would you like to be matched up with 4 other random people OR would you like have in a sense a ""captains draft"" / ""10 man"" before the day of the tournament.

Leave a comment in the thread and the majority wins!

to clarify you will not be playing the day before the tournament but rather you would be able to pick your team before the day of the tournament, you can choose to play with each other the day before or you can choose to play the day of the tournament. It would just be a little helpful to face teams with more coordination.

-YoBoiBokChoi

------------------------------

Edit7: I have decided due to ill timing that we will be extending sign ups till the 18th, we can have more people sign up and can also have more time to set up the servers/donations/casting.
Sorry for the wait and the inconvenience but it is needed for the tourney to run smoothly!
Stay tuned!

Tremendously is an understatement for how much my aim has improved by playing this map. Going from call of duty to cs has been a nightmare for me (what is this recoil!?) but after a few hours of practicing I can actually kill people. Even if you aren't new this map has settings for advanced users to practice their aim.


If you're like me and don't know how to install maps...

1.) Download the map and drag it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\maps

2.) If your console isn't enabled, enable it by going to help &amp; options (cs:go main menu) then game settings and enable developer console.

3.) Start the console by pressing ~ and type in map training_aim_csgo

1374847850.0	1j3ija	A few tips to newer players that want to improve their game (around nova/guardian)	sur_stromming	137	22	80	"Well, I am pretty frustrated once again due to pure lack of game sense of the people I play with in matchmaking (usually nova 3 to master guardian elites). By game sense I'm not referring to high level mind games and that kind of stuff. Just the simple things you could think of yourself but too many I play with don't seem to do so.

So here are a few things you need to consider if you want to start winning some more rounds (and this is my opinion, no thruths, no tips from a pro, just what i consider to be most reasonable but other people don't do):

* Don't reload your AK M4 or whatever you're wielding if it has more than 15 bullets left. If your aim is perfect 15 bullets are enough to kill 15 opponentsl If your aim is terrible 15 bullets are still enough to kill 1 enemy. Only reload if your gun is empty or if you are sure you are safe (e.g. all enemies spotted, you got good cover and so on)

* Also the opposite is true. If you're safe and your gun is empty rather reload it than swing around the corner with your deagle and try to spray 2 enemies with 7 bullets. Take a split second to reflect if you're safe. If you're stuck in a 1v1 and you need to defuse but the bomb just got planted the 2 seconds reloading most likely won't make the bomb go off (timer is 45 i think) but your chance of killing him and then defusing are skyrocketting.

* Most maps are not that big and you walk hella fast in CSGO. If you're the last T and got the bomb and you know both CT's alive are on A think if there is a safe route to B instead. 30 seconds is more than enough to run from inferno appartments all the way down second mid through banana again. If you can smoke ct spawn it will guarantee you at least a safe plant. If one rotates early you'll end up in a 1v1 which is still better than a 1v2.

* If you're CT and stuck in a 2v1, rather stay together than split up one on each site. If you split up one guy can usually cover like half the entrances of a site and you can get caught off guard pretty easily. And if the T gets the plant the second CT guy will have an even harder time. If you cover A together he will either die trying to plant A or he will go B. If he goes B you go B together and stay together and if he kills one of you, you'll have a good chance to kill trade immediately and defuse.

* If you're CT and the T's dropped the bomb try to set up a reasonable defense around the bomb instead of go hunt the remaining T's (at least 3 rounds every game lost because of this)

* If you try to take over or retake a bomb site try to hit from all angles at the same time. It happens way too often that a 1 after 1 after 1 gets killed by the last remaining enemy.

* Dr. Strangelove or how I stopped worrying and planting the bomb correctly:
Try to cover the planter as good as possible. I die every game at least once because some mate yells ""omg plant plant"" and I'll plant and get killed out of vents on B nuke although I have 3 mates nearby.
Try to think about good timings when to plant a bomb. If you sneak into a site and see CT's rotating away, you'd want to consider waiting a few seconds with the plant.
Try to think about where to plant the bomb. Are you covered? Plant in the open where you will have the best chance to shoot the defuser. Is the timer a problem or are you not covered, try to get down the bomb anywhere.

* If people die and you see the X AWP'd Y notification in the top right corner try to instantly look at the minimap to see where he died. Since people don't communicate as much you won't run into the same awper at least or you can smoke him etc. Also do this if your team gets kills. As T you will know where it's most likely to be safe to rotate to and as CT you know where they pushed and that there are probably more T's there (on my level of play, T's usually don't split that much, available strategies are ""A"", ""B"", ""fast A"", ""fast B"")

* If possible try to stay close enough to your teammates to kill trade. Especially if you happen to outnumber them. If the enemy ends up killing your mate the moment after the kill the enemy will most likely be very exposed, reloading or not expecting any more targets or all of the above. If you swing around the corner often times you will get an easy kill. Don't do this if you heard your mate die to 4 diffrent guns or the kill on him was assisted. In that case let your team know and rotate accordingly.

* Grenades are your enemy, even your own ones. It takes alot to learn how to use them properly. If you don't want to do that, keep your hands off granades. You will swing around corners and you will die with grenades drawn. Or an enemy will swing around the corner if you draw your grenade and you will die. I die once every third game because I got properly flashed. I kill at least 1 enemy every game because he has grenades drawn when he should not have. And you may also want to think about the money. Example for 3 rounds, buy 2 rounds full grenade set and AK and eco one round or buy 3 AK's and a smoke? Think for yourself what's more beneficial it depends on your grenade usage/efficiency and playstyle. Pro's will be better off the first way I think, most lower-mid players with the second one imo. A nade-set is at least 1000 if you buy 4 grenades (no decoy).

* Flashes: If you toss random flashes, your enemy will most likely NOT be blinded since he will either have time to dodge or won't be hit anyways (to blind him, look up some youtube videos for good pop flashes). So don't rely on your flashbang and rush in mindlessly.

* The exception are smokes. Most of the time you can throw them from a safe spot, you don't need to peak and there are alot of basic smokes that dont need practice to hit. If you goe A long on dust2, just throw your smoke somewhere direction CT spawn and you will most likely get to cross safely. If you go B on inferno smoke CT spawn and you will only have to care about guys comming from ruins.
Remeber: smokes are used most effectively defensive. If you smoke the hallway you want to rush out of you will probably die since you get seen before you can see out of the smoke.

* In general: Try to play passive. What i mean by that is try not to die in the first 30 seconds (unless rushes called). If you see the timer hit the 1-minute mark think about the situation and start pushing somewhere (as T). If you're not prepared (as CT) and get rushed, rather fall back than try to take down 5 enemies yourself. But don't play too passive every round either, mixups are not only great in fighting games.

* You don't need to buy in the first second. Press Tab and check the money of your mates. if they're poor check if they already bought :p. Even without macro and without shortcuts, buying will take 3 seconds max, so wait at least the first 5 seconds before you buy anything.

* If not everyone has enough money to buy, eco or drop the poor ones (which almost never happens, so eco). You need to all eco the same round. If you have only 3 rifles in your team 3 consecutive rounds you will lose all of them, if you eco once you will have 5 rifles in 2 rounds and you have a real chance to take the rounds. If you all eco you might try some ""cheesy"" stuff like 5 man stacks or 5 man rushes where it won't be expected. This way you end up winning more eco rounds.

* If you win the pistol round and your team buys 4 smg's the second round they're doing it for 2 reasons: smg's (not p90 though) give double the money for a kill. They're good to spray down ecoing pistols with no armor. If you die and the enemy picks up your smg, it won't penetrate the armor of your teammates and you will win the smg duell. So if your mates buy 4 smg's consider not buying AK m4, because if you lose the gun it will kill your team.

* In general: Take your time to think before you do anything and check the minimap to keep track of the situation. You need to know what angles are covered and which are not. Also notice the spots your mates are playing and covering and think what you need to cover to get the most of a defensive position and no one will get shot in the back.

* Think before you make calls or you'll bait your teammates. Don't yell ""B B B B B"" if there is only a flash beeing trown. If you see 3 enemies at B, don't tell ""all B"" or your teammates will get picked while rotating. And seriously consider using your mic to make calls since writing takes a whole lot longer :)

* Learn to explicitly call ""rotate"". A lot of people will call where enemies are and perhaps if they see the bomb, but then nothing else. If you're the one in the middle of the action, you're in the best position to know whether rotating makes sense or whether everybody else should keep holding their sites. Don't leave it up to your teammates to decide if they should rotate or not based on your brief call and what they can see on the radar.

* Think about how your enemies will be rotating before you attack a site and if possible leave somebody to kill them (or at least slow them down). In MM it seems like nobody pays attention to the game while rotating because they're too focused on getting to the site ASAP. Easy kills that can easily turn a round. In general just pay attention to controlling the map (not just the bomb sites).

* Stop telling people how to play when they're in a clutch situation. Just give important info. Don't yell ""HE'S PLANTING A"" if you're not even sure if it's A. Your talking will distract the player and he will want to win the round as well, so give him information but not ""opinion"" or ""advise""!


That's all I can think of right now.

So i guess this is my way to deal with rage and I sincerely hope this helps somebody. I know most of the dumb things get made because yolo and they would know better themselves but consider to try at least as hard as your teammates do, thank you.

cheers :)

It appears that Valve accidentally released the update intended for tomorrow at around 6:40 PM CDT. SteamDB, made by /u/xPaw and /u/Marlamin, verifies: http://steamdb.info/app/730/#section_history

Valve reverted the leak, but some users still have it.

Here's what we've discovered so far:

* Bomb defusal was modified so that if you turn away from the bomb, defusing will abort

* Militia appears to be added to the comp. map pool

 * For those that got their copy of the leak reverted, here's a download of Militia: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1ap6u0/csgo_update_for_32013_leak_new_main_menu_ui_and/c8zhsvy

 * /u/strangemodule has a video walkthrough of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05QoqodPxu0

* A new main menu UI was added: http://i47.tinypic.com/2eybeph.jpg (courtesy of /u/esoh54)

- Updated Overwatch FAQ (http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/)
- Overwatch case reviews will highlight kills and assists from The Suspect in kills feed.
- Overwatch case reviews will not record the team name when all five players play with their clan tag.
- Servers running with default setting sv_kick_players_with_cooldown 1 will not allow players convicted by Overwatch to play, setting it to 0 will allow convicted players to join.
 
### STEAM BADGES

- Updated CS:GO Steam trading card art to their final designs and names
 
### MISC

- Fixed an exploit with disconnecting and reconnecting players being able to respawn in the same round.
- Network interpolation and update convars can no longer be changed when playing. To configure these convars, players must not be connected to a server or must join the spectators.
- Enforced signature validation of game dlls and plugins. Clients launching with tampered dlls will be informed of the invalid signatures error, and will not be allowed to connect to VAC secure servers to avoid being VAC banned.
- Fixed a problem in the GOTV recorder that could result in some non-delayed data getting written into the recorded stream, causing playback artifacts.

You'd think that this almost never happens when in Competitive play or in the higher tier games, but oh my God, it does.

I'm going to stress this out to every single player that refuses to be a part of the strategy. Are there things I'm missing in these?

**Guidelines**

* At the beginning of a round, check the scoreboard and see if everyone can do a full buy. If someone doesn't have enough money, see if someone has enough to drop 1-2 weapons. It's a bad idea to buy a weapon just because you can afford it, if everyone else is not buying anything. Don't buy at the first very second of the round. ""I didn't know we had to eco"" is not an excuse.

* Do not buy every round unless everyone in your team can afford a full buy or unless you're forced to buy (e.g last round, or in a severe disadvantage). Do a save round every once in awhile.

* If someone calls for a save round, comply. Don't buy on your own, because if you die, next round your teammates will have money to buy weapons and you will not.

* Don't buy the most expensive weapon you can afford, just because you can afford it. Think ahead, see how many potential rounds are left. Also, I hope I don't have to tell you that a more expensive weapon doesn't necessarily mean it's a better choice for your style of play.

* In higher level teams, the team leader/strategy caller decides what people should buy and when. I realise that's utopic in Valve's Matchmaking, but at least have the decency to decide together at the start of the rounds whether you're full buying, light buying or saving for the next round.

* In the save rounds talk to the team and try to be unpredictable. Stack somewhere, hold uncommon angles, rush, etc. Statistics say you'll lose, especially on 1vs1 combat, but every once in awhile, if played correctly, a save round will end in your favor. Know when to save a weapon and most importantly know what the benefits/disadvantages of being alive at the end of the timer are.

* If you can afford it, drop a weapon for one of your teammates if they request it. You'll most likely find yourself in the same situation, sooner or later.


**Specifics**

* The pistol round is important and it can decide the fate of the next 1-2 rounds. Feel free to buy whatever you see fit for those $800. Armor, grenades, a better pistol, defuse kit. Coordinate with your teammates and see who needs to buy what, according to the strategy you're using.

* If you lost the pistol round, SAVE (unless you're forced to buy). It's a bad idea to buy a weapon without kevlar/helmet and it will get you even more in trouble for the next round, monetary wise.

* Aim to get a bomb planted in the first two rounds as a T. Even if you lose, you'll be able to full buy in the third round. As a CT, typically you'll need to save in the third round as well, in order to afford a full buy.

* If you won the pistol round, the other team should be saving. Always buy the kevlar &amp; *helmet* to protect yourself from lucky headshots, and buy light. Typically, you can pick up a high-reward-per-kill SMG ($600), or a Shotgun ($900). Take advantage of the fact that the enemy won't have kevlar &amp; helmet and try to earn as much money as possible.

**Bonus:** I hear a lot of bad advice when trying to save my weapon, at the end of a round, before the timer runs out. ""Drop the bomb, or you'll get no money"" (when I'm T), or ""Try and get the kill, you will get no money"" (when I'm CT). Get your facts straight, it's not that hard. The CTs as the defending side, win if the timer runs out. The Ts, as the offensive side will get no money if they run out of time, independent of the fact that they have the bomb or not.

EDIT: Alright guys, done for now, thanks for the questions! Time to go test out the new update and prepare for our last practice before ESEA LAN :D"	t5_2sqho	True

1373772681.0	1i98ry	Announcement: altPUG is Live!	tasky	128	17	99	"Hey all,
 
I know we've talked about it for a while, and then it got real quiet for a while, but /u/MrPig and I have finally pulled the trigger and launched [altPUG](http://www.altpug.com/)!  We've been ecstatic to sponsor the Reddit Tournament this weekend -- big shout out to /u/Kubz91 for organizing a terrific event!
 
&gt;**What is altPUG?**
 
altPUG is a competitive PUG system alternative to ESEA and Leetway. We provide high quality 128-tick servers with excellent hit registration, and we have a custom-built anti-cheat client to ensure those servers remain free of hackers. Out of the box, we're supporting servers in US East, Central, West, and Europe; if there's demand we can rapidly scale out to Asia, Australia, and South America.  Servers are created on-demand to make sure that we always have capacity for more players. Our ability to scale to other geographic regions is important because no one likes playing with high ping. Along those lines we won't allow players to join servers if their ping is over 120ms - this means you won't need to deal with players with high pings in your games!
 
altPUG also has automatic team balancing based on skill with a built-in buddy system; this means that if you ""buddy"" people on our service we will keep you and your friends together when balancing teams. However, if the skill gap between the two potential teams is too large we might split up groups of buddies. Your skill is based on ""Efficacy"", a formula we use to calculate how much of an impact you have on your team's success.
 
altPUG is in its infancy and we have big plans for where we can take this service. We're looking to empower the CS:GO competitive community to grow from the ground up - this means we need your help.
 
&gt;**What do you want from me?**
 
We want you to use the service and provide feedback! We want direct community involvement and we want to know: What are you looking for in a service? What do you like about altPUG? What gaps are we missing?
 
We're aware fragmentation in the PUG community could lead to a worse experience. With players spread out around four services (Valve Matchmaking, altPUG, ESEA, Leetway) the wait times before games start could increase - however, we believe that more options are better for players and we think we can provide a very high quality service (or at the very least force others to improve to compete). So we need the whole community to help make altPUG the best service it can be.
 
&gt;**How much is it?**
 
Right now, altPUG is free. Mr. Pig and I are looking at options to make the service self-sustaining as we're currently paying for this out-of-pocket (and it ain't cheap!); however, we felt it was more important to launch and focus on providing a quality product first.
 
&gt;**What about leagues and tournaments?**
 
We're having a blast watching all the Reddit teams play and /u/Kubz91, the TNP Gaming guys, WarOwl, and Team Fixation guys cast this Reddit Cup! Although we don't have league/scrim support currently built into altPUG it's VERY high on our to-do list and we're very interested in supporting the kinds of community run tournaments and cups like the one TNP Gaming has put together!
 
We hope to have more to announce about leagues, scrims, and tournaments in the coming weeks.

Since as the petition to Valve looked like it was going to take a lot of time and effort, we at www.Cadred.org have decided to throw some CS:GO beta keys in the direction of this sub-Reddit.

We also must stress that it wouldn't be possible without Valve who hooked us up after seeing the work we'd done for the community, so make sure you show them some love too. They've been great. After hearing that we were offering you guys twenty keys originally aimed at Cadred readers, Valve were awesome enough to send us twenty keys just for you guys - so these keys aren't really from us, they're right from Valve to you!

OK, so to earn your chance at a key all you have to do is post in this thread with a link to your Steam Profile. After 48 hours we shall go through and pick people out at random from the list and make contact with them to earn their keys.

If you miss out, don't worry. Cadred.org still has lots of keys to give out and we'll be doing so via our website, via our Facebook and via our Twitter, as well as at the AMD GamExperience in London on the 25th (in case any of you Redditers are going).

The first website giveaway can be found here: http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/168467/ and will run for a week.

Best of luck to everyone entering.

EDIT 

OK, that's the 20 keys distributed. Congratulations to the winners, commiserations to the losers.
On a serious note I want to thank you guys for the show of support towards the website and what we're trying to do and we hope that you guys will drop in on us from time to time. We really want to grow the community for this game because that's the only way it's going to have a future. We'll be sure to pimp out this Reddit where and when we can as well and kudos for setting it up. We'll be producing lots of content for you guys to enjoy.
Finally, and I hope we don't get accused of being cynical, we are still running other giveaways on our website that aren't as ""open"" as this one. Yes, you would have to like our Facebook page. No-one has to do that if they don't want to but if you are so inclined details of our latest giveaway can be found here:

http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/169517/

Thanks again to all of you and all the best for the future.

1346879295.0	zevfm	Why are there so many 1.6 players that don't want to give CS:GO a legitimate chance?	4percentMilk	129	23	165	"I have been reading threads on other fourms (such as http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=18&amp;threadid=179641), and I just can't seem to understand why so many 1.6 players are being so stubborn.  Is it just ignorance?

I've been a CS 1.6 player for a long time, and even played a bit competitively (4-5 seasons of cal).  I always declared CS 1.6 as my favorite multiplayer game of all time.  When Source came out I was excited, but let down.  I barely played Source and thought that the game was awful (opinion).

When CS:GO came out I didn't know what to expect.  I was invited to the beta and thought, ""Eh, it's okay,"" but after all of the updates this game just keeps getting better and better.  A lot of the randomness factors seem to have been removed and the game is back to a skill-based setting.

I understand and agree that some things need to change to make the game more competitive.  For example, maps should be more clear (instead of foggy), but this is already being taken care of in custom maps (and we could possibly make them official if we show Valve that we care enough).  As for some other complaints:

- I don't understand the ""player models are too hard to see,"" excuse.  I have yet to have an issue seeing a player hiding behind a box or in the distance.  Is this just a nitpick?

- I feel that hit registration is great in CS:GO.  People just can't seem to grasp that hitboxes are a lot tighter than ever before.  You can't hit the corner of an invisible cube to get a headshot anymore.

- Spraying feels just as skill based/rewarding in CS:GO as 1.6 to me.  You must learn the spray patterns of each individual gun and you will be rewarded for more accurate sprays.

To me, CS:GO has a lot of potential to be a great game.  I love 1.6 as much as the next guy, but I want to see CS:GO grow and achieve.  Here's to hoping this game gets bigger and better everyday."	t5_2sqho	True

I was on the team opposite The Suspect. I know this because I have a clear recollection of specific events that happened in one of the rounds and how they unfolded and they were exactly the same, along with my score. Anyway, it revealed a bit of a flaw in the system. 

I recall in this particular match that The Suspect was playing pretty normally in the beginning, and the demo does indeed verify that nothing fishy was going on. However, it was later on in the match that the people I played with and I suspected he ""toggled on"" and started making impossible shots, perfect peeks, and the like. The problem is that this demo was in the beginning of the match when we didn't think anyone was cheating. Maybe Valve should make it so that the system logs when reports are made and then flags those rounds for review? Is it possible that different people participating in Overwatch view different rounds of the same demo? I'm a bit worried that people can easily fly under the radar of Overwatch by simply toggling for a portion of the match."	t5_2sqho	True

(I will be comparing it to the css counterpart since 1.6 mechanics are too different. 
 You can find the game's weapon files in Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\scripts.
 They are there in readable .txt format. Weapon_*.txt)


**First of all, damage against armored enemies is too low.**

 ""WeaponArmorRatio"" is 1.2 while CSS had 1.475.
 This may seem pretty minor to some of you, but this basically killed grenade stacking (for example, double nading lower tunnels on dust2 as CT; even if you land both grenades T will survive with red HP)

**Secondly, damage radius is too small.**

 This one is pretty obvious, but I don't have numbers to prove this one since css and go use different measurements (""Range""""350"" in GO and ""Range""""4096"" in css) However, there is an indirect proof: [8.8% of css playerbase](http://steamcommunity.com/stats/CS:S/achievements/) killed 3 with a single HE grenade while [only 1.5% did it in GO](http://steamcommunity.com/stats/CSGO/achievements/) (I know css is older, but other similar achievements don't differ that much in numbers)

**Last but not the least is how weak they are on cluttered maps.**

[This is what I'm talking about](http://i.imgur.com/g0zp1YG.jpg).
 It explodes 1 metre away from my face but deals only 6hp due to the tiny wooden chipboard which apparently protected me. I don't say that grenades should damage through metres of concrete (like they did in 1.6) but their penetration has to be increased.

**Oh, and one more thing. Collision models.**

 -  When playing competitive or with sv_competitive_official_5v5 set, the minimap will show player hotkey values like the overview map does.
 -  Added convar cl_radar_always_centered ( default 1 ) then when set to 0 makes more efficient use of the radar at the expense of moving the POV away from the center.
 -  Added 2 options to the radar, allowing players to change the scale and orientation. These are exposed in the Game Settings menu, or directly with the cl_radar_scale ( default 0.7 ) and cl_radar_rotate ( default 1 ) convars, respectively.
 -  Added convar cl_radar_icon_scale_min ( default 0.6 ) that allows radar icons to be kept large when the scale is reduced.
 -  Moved the planted bomb icon from below the radar to the timer.
 -  Fixed radar showing above or below on a player when spectating them from chase.
-  CS:GO Player Profile:
 -  All players can now view other players medals/coins on the in-game Player Profile page.

 -  Added a shortcut to view a friend's CS:GO Player Profile page from the main menu friends list.
-  Added ""Disable Autogenerated DM Spawns?"" to info_map_parameters entity that allows mapper to specify that no dm spawns should be autogenerated and will be mapper-placed instead.
-  Added more options for map filtering in server browser:
 -  The default map filter now performs substring matching. (dust will find de_dust2_se, cs_dustyhouse, workshop or fastdl versions of maps, etc.)
 -  A single slash will search for a prefix in the base map name. (/cs will search for all hostage rescue maps)
 -  An asterisk will search for a map name suffix. (*_se will search for any map ending in ""_se"")
 -  A double slash will search for an exact map name prefix. (///125488374/ will search for the official workshop de_dust2_se. ///official will search for all official workshop non-se maps)
 -  Added support for official cs_militia map workshop id 133256570 to be played as part of dedicated servers workshop collection mapcycle."	t5_2sqho	True

Some of these users have complained about damage to their hardware. In response, [Craig 'Torbull' Levine](http://play.esea.net/users/7) issued a [statement](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;id=12692) that said ""*We also ask anyone who has experienced any physical damage to their computers to open an ESEA support ticket.*"" Fastforward a few days, ESEA Premium member pissjugs posts a [screenshot](http://oi42.tinypic.com/2h6g4zr.jpg) of a reponse from Levine that says the affected computer would need to be shipped to [PC Werks](http://www.mypcwerks.com/) in Garland, Texas. Going to the [PC Werks website](http://www.mypcwerks.com/), one will notice two different phone numbers. The first, 214-658-8352, located in the top righthand corner and the second, 214-341-2852, located in the [homepage promotion banner](http://i.imgur.com/CFnMJPM.jpg). After Googling the second number, one will find that this is also the same number as an organization called [Lethal Gamers](http://www.lethalgamers.com/). If one goes to the [Lethal Gamer's contact page](http://lethalgamers.com/?page=contact), one will find two email addresses. One is admin@lethalgamers.com and the other is brett@lethalgamers.com. After Googling Lethal Gamers, one will find [this ESEA News post](http://news.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12334) about an upcoming Lethal Gamers lan event. Reading through the comments on ESEA, one will learn that Lethal Gamers is run by two guys named Brett and Laurent. Specifically in post #55, ESEA Administrator [iTech](http://news.esea.net/users/212617) links to [Brett's](http://news.esea.net/users/190669) and [Laurent's] (http://news.esea.net/users/151079) ESEA profiles. Looking at Brett's ESEA profile you'll notice he goes by B 'Few' S and if you look at his biography you'll also notice that he has been working for ESEA News since 2010. Furthermore, you'll also notice that both Brett 'Few' S and Laurent 'glostik' Genin are both mutual friends with Craig 'Torbull' Levine and Eric 'lpkane' Thunberg on ESEA. So as it stands, we've uncovered that Levine is attempting to get users to ship their computers to a computer repair store that has affiliation with ESEA employees and most likely is staffed by ESEA employees, talk about a conflict of interest. However, let's not stop there. Let's look into some of Laurent 'glostik' Genin's and Brett 'Few' S's comments on the bitcoin matter. [Here](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=492245&amp;find_comment_number=58#n58) is a post made by Laurent 'glostik' Genin that reads ""*I am just wondering how you are going to prove without a shadow of a doubt that your video card was fried by the esea client. In the world of electronics that is going to be near impossible.*"" After I contacted ESEA management about the issue, Laurent 'glostik' Genin [responded](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=news&amp;d=comments&amp;id=12692&amp;find_comment_number=1420#n1420) in the Bitcoin Fiasco thread saying ""*That PC Shop hes asking you to send stuff to is the same one thats run LethalGamers for 12 yrs. They have always supported the gamers and done alot for the gamers. If theres something legitly wrong with your stuff, they are going to tell you. They are not biased towards anyone.*""

**tl;dr - Torbull is telling users that they would need to ship their PC's to a computer repair shop that has affiliation with ESEA employees and is most likely staffed by ESEA employees. These same employees have commented on ESEA saying the issues are ""near impossible"" to prove. This is a major conflict of interest. Imagine if you got into a car accident and the person that hit you wanted you to take your car to their uncle's bodyshop but without telling you it's their uncle's. This situation is no different.**

Also to Matt Wood from valve, your advice was awesome!!

Just to answer a few questions.

Why is this so important?
movement is a BIG part of CS and a major gameplay mechanic, it can't be neither too fast, nor too slow, and acceleration has to be just right so that other gameplay mechanics aren't compromised by it, as movement is the central piece on the CS franchise


Why change movement?
Dont get me wrong moving in CSGO feels good, but it could be better, sometimes holding that angle or using that cover isn't as efficient as it could be, mainly because of how people move, these values will make that less likely to hapen.



How would changing movement benefit the game?

To answer this I'll have to ask another question. 
Why do you love CS? its a personal question, but I'm sure that every CS player plays the game to get that feeling of accomplishment you get when you successfully execute a strat, hold a push to a bombsite all by yourself, pull 3v1 clutch, hold that angle to gain advantage over the enemy, or manage to kill those 2 guys with a headshot because you used the environment better, or simply because you have better aim and control movement better.

These are the things we love about CS, and the current movement model has some incompatibilities we some of these things, carefully tweaking movement will help these things be consistent again to some degree, it wont be 100% perfect but it will be a step in the right direction.

The purpose of this (aside from trying to fix ADAD spamm) is to make a model of movement that makes CSGO a better game to play, by encouraging people to play it like it should be played and rising the skill ceiling without sacrificing what makes it so fun. 

This movement initiative started as a fix to ""ADAD"" spamm, but, the tests we made showed that movement alone wont fix ADADAD, it may help but wont fix it completely. It needs to be fixed by increasing tagging or tweaking inaccuracy while moving or both.
What these values do achieve is to make the game feel awesome





How are you planing on adjusting and tweaking?

First we got some control values to compare our values with.
We recorded 1.6's values and GO's values in slow mo then we analysed them frame by frame and wrote down the speed at each frame.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkghPvIh7ZVwdEo3UWhJNTE4WXJfZ0FQYXhFTUdwZ1E#gid=0

(props to majkelDre)

and created the graphics for each curve to have a visual representation of how movement behaves, after analysing and testing the best, we came up with 4 sets of values.

Considering our control values we made some that were diverse in relation to it, then we approached the community, and the most voted were the ones that were slower than both 1.6 and GO.

we decided that the best value would be the one that had similar speed to 1.6 but that its curve was similar to GO's so that acceleration would remain proportional to it, we didn't had a value like that so we had to test some more and to find it, and that was it.
After collecting some feedback and testing we came up with these values




sv_friction 4
sv_accelerate 4.7
sv_airaccelerate 16




The next step is going to be setting up a server and testing these.
Then when we gather enough data we'll present these to other community members and ajust as needed so that everyone is happy.

DSTFU	116	24	77	"I just spent around 20 seconds on a TDM server with what looked like an mp5 or something and got 2 deaths and 1 kill. I have literally no idea what to do, which guns are best for which situation, how to win gun fights, which maps are which, hell, I don't even know how to differentiate between teammates and enemies on the battlefield. 

I have FPS experience although none in CS, all in BF2, BC2, and BF3. I know a lot of you out there are amazing at this game and I'd like to get some tips from you.

What is the best map and gamemode for a noob and what is the ""noobiest"" setup (I'm assuming theres this OP gun that everybody flames, I'll use that to get used to the game)

Also is there a good YouTube who has tips and gun reviews (like in BF3, it was LVLcap) also is there a website I can be directed to that has weapon stats and everything (like recoil values, damage, etc)

edit: another question: in DM I automatically spawn in with a gun is there a way to choose? Of course being a nub I don't actually know the differences but maybe in the future I will need to tactically choose. I know sometimes it goes ""press G to respawn with the special gun"" on the left side or something.

also my BF3 experience has helped because I spawned in with an AWP and ended up quickscoping everybody in a small 5v5 DM in the train tracks city thing map. Hehe"	t5_2sqho	True

* Would you consider a cs_ tournament also? (something new)
* Would 2 tournaments be ok, one for EU and one for NA?
* Single/Double elim? Groups?
* One night or over time?
* Anything else?

Gamesense:

What is gamesense exactly? Gamesense is your CS meta-game: your ability to see the big picture of whats happening on the map. Gamesense is about consciously keeping track of where enemies could potentially be at all times at allparts of the map, regardless of whether you see them or not. You do this based on your intuition, information from radar, information from teammates, and game knowledge and experience. You use your gamesense to put yourself in advantageous positions whenever possible and to avoid being put in a situation where you are at a disadvantage. Gamesense is about picking when, where and under what terms you fight so that you have a better chance at defeating your 
opponent. 

For example: you're in a 1v1 on dust2. The bomb is planted at A just as you are beginning to walk up the ramp from CT spawn to long A. The terrorist, as not to give away his position walks after planting. As you continue walking up ramp you will use your knowledge of the bomb plant zone in coordination with how much time has elapsed since the bomb  plant to keep a mental map of where the terrorist could be. Initially (for the first 2-3 seconds), it would be silly to turn and face catwalk/short A because he could have not possibly have traversed that much ground that quickly. However, as more time passes, it would be wise  pop a few glances back at short to make sure he isn't walking that way. As you reach  long you know for a fact that he has to be somewhere at the top of long and the corner betweem short and site. He doesn't know where you are, you know roughly where he is, and you've made your job taking the site and defusing the bomb much easier.

Gamesense is also about making good decisions. This means not getting into long rage fights with your M4 against an AWP. It means sometimes falling back and retreating from a gunfight that's not going your way to re-engage later. It means using your knowledge to flank quickly, confidently, and at the right moment. The more people complain about your obnoxious play style, the better (unless you're camping spawn and not doing the objective -- that's a different matter entirely).

Choke points:

Like I said earlier, gamesense is about knowing where enemies can and cannot be at any given time. Obviously both sides in CS start at their respective spawn and then spread out across the map where they eventually meet and firefights ensue. Due to the locations of spawns, the maps have natural ""sides"", usually separated by choke points. For example, dust2 is initially split as follows: Tunnel in B, double doors at A, and Long A tunnel. You should always use great caution when approaching these points and how you approach them will vary with your spawn (I talk more about this later).

Peeking:

Corners should be peeked progressively -- peeking every common spot from which to watch that corner one at a time (this is when not coordinating a rush, of course). If you peek all at once and you're looking at the wrong angle, you'll have train your crosshair on your enemy before shooting, where as all he has to do is pull the trigger -- most of the time you will lose this fight. Additionally, you do not peek corners with your mouse, you peek them with your strafe buttons after already setting your mouse in position for the peek. 

Crosshair management:

You should always keep your crosshair where it is most likely to encounter an enemy and you should keep it aimed at head level. When an enemy appears on your screen, you want to reduce the distance you have to move your mouse to shoot them to as close to 0 as possible. When you are traveling the map you should always keep your crosshair trained on the corner the enemy is most likely to appear from. Those who do not do this have what is known as, ""lazy crosshair syndrome,"" and it gets them killed.

Radar:

You really need to be keeping an eye on your radar (a glance every few seconds). You should know that if you're playing long on dust2 and your buddy goes down on short, leaving A uncovered, you have 3 - 7 seconds to turn and face A site before you get flanked and shot in the back. You want to make sure that you never get shot in the back and that you shoot people in the back as often as possible. 

Spawn location:

Let's say you are CT spawned on dust2 and you're playing 5v5 competitive and are playing bombsite B. If you have a good spawn, it is possible to for you to run into tunnel and shoot at the T tunnel entrance as they come enter. If you have a bad spawn, the T's will be swarming in B tunnel before you get to this peek location -- if you attempt this rush-peek, you'll find a a few T's in the tunnel already and you're likely going to get toasted. With the worst B spawn, you'll even have issues making it to B platform (the raised area) before a T is peeking it! This means if you have a bad spawn for B, your best bet is probably to play from closet, site boxes, or closet -- it's also probably a good idea to smoke off tunnel entrance to make it harder for T's to pick into site without exposing themselves from multiple angles at once. If you want to get even more nit-picky, when running into B to take your position, you should always run in backwards? Why? Because T's typically flash out of B tunnel on B rushes and you don’t want to get blinded before you can even get into position.

Stealth:

You want to unexpected. This means if you're close to where enemies could be and time is a non-issue (plenty of round time, bomb not planted) you should be walking. You don't want someone peeking your corner knowing undoubtedly that you are standing on the other side and exactly what angle you are at. Conversely, if you know that enemies can't be within hearing distance, you should be running at full speed to maximize the likelihood that you show up somewhere (like to a bombsite on a rotation) faster than the enemy is expecting you be there.

The unexpected:

We all know that it's advantageous to be near cover. Because of this, as noted above, people peek cover locations. In response,  high level players will sometimes sit out of cover to ensure that when the enemy rounds the corner, the enemy have will have to move his crosshair in order to shoot the player – essentially meaning the enemy must score a headshot in order to survive. This is not to take away from the advantage of being close to cover – most of the time on defense you should be in a place where you can retreat easily or have high survivability. This is only one example of the unexpected, but you get the point.

**Map overview ideas

It would basically be a second spectating mode. The red and blue dots would actually be the real models that you'd see run around in real time. It's like a more elaborate free cam. So imagine like a Starcraft 2 map, but for CS. You could use your mouse to zoom in on certain areas, click on individual players, maybe even using your mousewheel to zoom in to a certain player and jump into 1st person, stuff like that. I think if we try to implement spectating features that make SC2 and LoL so successful, we can only improve the game.

Some of the features listed here could also be included in ""normal"" mode (1st and 3rd person), like ""Go to where the bomb is"", or maybe even ""Go to best fragger"". Just simple tools to make spectating easier.

1355656570.0	14xsh6	How do we make CSGO become what 1.6 used to be in terms of popularity?	bjarkebjarke	105	16	162	"So, I'm in a rush of nostalgia after reading interviews on a Danish site about the CPL tournaments in the start 00's. I remember sitting up until 8AM in the morning following Danish teams on HLTV when they played in the states. It seemed like only a matter of years, if not months, before CS 1.5/6 would shoot through the roof and almost be shown on TV. Hell, in Scandinavia, every kid my age(at this time, 12-13 years old) played counter strike. We'd always wait for it to be friday so we could pack up our bigass CRT monitors and go to our friends house and bootcamp all weekend.

What happened? CS:S came out. It split up the scene, and was generally bad competitively. CS 1.6 had the gameplay - CS:S had the community as new players would always get the ""new game"" with better graphics rather than the old one which looked like LEGO or something.

Looking at CS:GO, I don't feel it has revived the competitive scene at all. Yeah, there are a few tournaments where NiP will rape up some frenchmen, sure. But the problem remains the same: **there is no player base**. No playerbase, no sponsors(as these cannot expose their products), thus no money.

My question is then: How do we make CS:GO popular to both the casual player as well as the competitive player?

The gaming market is definitely more competitive than when CS came out in 1999. Back then, it was revolutionary as no other game really had these very simple aspects. Quake/Unreal Tournament were the only other ""big shots"" - and they were totally different games. Today, CS:GO has to compete against Battlefield, Call of Duty, and I don't know how many other titles are out there. Considering this competition, I understand the direction Valve chose; They made a game that simply has too many compromises in terms of gameplay. Now, I do play CSGO competitively, I game about 20 hours a week.. But I feel like I'm playing a crossover between an xbox 360 game and a computer game. The feeling is, at many times, just plain wrong. Kudos to Valve for trying to work it out lately; the last few matches definitely made the feel better. But still..

So, what can we, as a community, do? My answer is: Not much. The CS playerbase seems somewhat constant, if not in a negative value. New players to the FPS genre will choose CoD/battlefield as their casual game, not counter strike. 

Is the title somewhat dead? Whats your take on it?

And 'mericans, how big is the game there? I remember times where the biggest tournaments were held in the US. It doesn't seem like that anymore.

 This was followed with news that the Golden Five were no [more](http://www.hltv.org/news/10994-esc-gaming-to-disband) and that Loord has [retired](http://www.hltv.org/news/10995-loord-announces-retirement). 

 News then broke that Markeloff had left [Na'Vi](http://www.hltv.org/news/10996-markeloff-leaves-navi). In the statement from Na'Vi the following team was put forth:

Markeloff (ex-Na `Vi)

Adren (ex-VP)

Angel (ex-VP)

Dosia (ex-VP)

Fox (ex-VP) - questionable

 According to rumours Edward was offered a place but he decided to stay with Na'Vi. This means that Kucher, and Adren are free agents, and Pasza, Neo, Kuben, and Taz's future is uncertain. 
 
 However, the team put forth in Na'Vi's statement does not follow what GuardiaN said, meaning that it might not be the correct team. If we go by what GuardiaN said, an expected lineup would be 2 players from ESC, 2 players from VP, and Markeloff.

**Edit:** Virtus.Pro have issued a fierce statement slamming the actions of their players: """"We are waiting for Virtus.pro and Na´Vi organisations to further comment on this matter, we want to stress the fact that VP's players have signed their contracts until the end of the year and now they are leaving autocratically, blackmailing us with unsatisfying conditions.

""Considering not only their misbehavior and devil-may-care attitude, but also potential involvement of a Na`Vi player in a newly-built roster, we decided not to take part in this inadmissible dialogue which led to team’s dismissal.

My rant on the current system"	Fyrezerk	107	24	87	"Things are getting out of hand and it seems to me like the developers just aren't interested in making a quality competitive matchmaking system. The change to 64 tick is just further proof that the people in charge don't truly know what is required to keep competitive CS players interested.



**Maps**

The rotation sucks. It's evident that not much care went into developing a quality competitive rotation. Dust2, Train, Nuke, Inferno, and maybe Vertigo are the only current maps that should be in the rotation. In addition to that, there are a good half dozen well designed maps that need to be added so that people aren't bored playing the same stale maps over and over. The rotation isn't the entire problem, however. Nobody has gotten a good answer as to why the _se versions of the maps aren't being played. These maps are much cleaner and produce much better performance, especially for people with lower end hardware. ESEA is doing this right, which is exactly why you're seeing significantly more people playing on their servers than on the built in servers. It really says something when more people want to pay than to play for free.

**Servers**

I've already mentioned how the new tick rate is a joke, so I'll expand upon that... The new tick rate is a joke. Anybody with any experience in competitive play will tell you that anything less than 100 tick is unplayable, so why would you even consider making that change? Paying for servers to host 100+ tick cost too much? Well guess what, developing a game that gets shitty sales costs even more. It's understandable that you want to give people with lower end hardware and internet connections a chance, but creating a poor play environment is not the answer. The shot reg on the servers is disgustingly bad and I'm one more miserable match away from quitting all together. 


**Positives**

Not everything has gotten worse since the intial launch. While the game never should have been launched without a functional ELO system, I'm glad it's finally out, and it seems to be doing it's job fairly well. Furthermore, things have settled down considerably in terms of quitters and punishment issues.



All-in-all I'm still of the belief that this game can be saved, but only if development is taken seriously. Increasing the tickrate and fixing the map rotation are just the start of what should be a continuous process of creating a competitive environment that actually attracts new people rather than turning them away."	t5_2sqho	True

* The esports or competitive community draws its player base from the casual community. The casual community and the competitive community need to be playing the exact same game, with minor variation, for the former to feed the later. 
* Counter-Strike is best played competitively.
* Free to play is in CS’s future. 
* In game match making is CS:Go’s most defining feature
* Valve’s support for DoTA2 through the invitational and constant interaction is incredibly beneficial and CS could use the same love.

We’re seeing a huge resurgence in competitive FPS’s popularity. The recent events put up good numbers on Twitch.TV and a lot of the old guard is coming back to play CS:Go. It feels as though we are primed to burst out into a second golden age. What we need now is Valve’s support.

By hosting Operation Payback, Valve experiments with pricing and features. We can use this model to try to plot the most ideal road map for our future. Spade detailed why Operation Payback is a good idea very articulately [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1d4k33/why_i_like_operation_payback/). Remember, Payback does not remove features, it merely allows people to play maps through the casual match making process. Trying to find a community server hosting your desired custom map which also contains players is virtually impossible. By queuing under a playlist, lesser played map will receive attention by virtue of being grouped with more well known ones. 

The in game competitive match maker helps the competitive community by transitioning casual players into the competitive scene by covering what I think of as the “ESEA gap”. Now, traditionally the community assumes casual competitive players play match making, but the real hardcore shell out the cash and join intimidating ESEA. Here's the problem with ESEA, there's no telling which other team is going to join your scrim. You can restrict entry into your scrim based on league, but that's not entirely useful since even if you restrict entry to Open, the lowest league, there's a huge variation in talent within that division. Also, there's a million non-league scrim teams made up of a million different combinations of the old boys club. You can have a scrim team made up of invite players, but because it is a scrim team it technically has no league rank. 

The in-game ranked match making model is critical to promoting growth in both player skill and player base by ensuring relatively even competitive matches. No one would play SC2 if you risked being paired against MarineKingPrime. 

**Valve should host a Valve Experimental-Inaugural Season ticket:** 

* Competitive map list including ESEA maps de_mirage, de_season, de_mill, and 2 new untested competitive maps such as de_seaside
* 128 Tic servers
* 2 flash bangs
* 1:45 second round times

The cost can either be minimal, or CS:Go can go free to play and bill for season tickets. **Customers who already own CS:Go will receive season tickets for free.**

This will give the community an opportunity to test new maps for competitive play, increase the player base, and help the scene health. ESEA will still exist for the hardcore and will even benefit from increased competitive attention and the larger player pool from which to draw customers.

* Deagle: increased effective range.

* P250: reduced effective range.

* Glock: increased recoil on burst.

* Added a community dedicated server convar ""sv_workshop_allow_other_maps"". When this option is enabled and the server is idling empty, it will allow players to reserve it on another workshop map. Server will then download the other workshop map and let players play it, after the map ends the players will mapcycle into workshop collection hosted by the server.

* Added a game setting 'Max Acceptable Matchmaking Ping' to allow users in geographic locations far from official datacenters to find games via matchmaking without using developer's console.

* Servers starting to host a workshop collection will no longer show up as running de_dust.

* Added convar mp_death_drop_c4 that determines whether C4 is droppable.

* Fixed not being able to drop C4 in Demolition mode.

* Added display of public joinable games in maps workshop browser.

* Fixed dead players getting a network update that showed their dead icon position at the position of the player they jumped to spectate right after dying

* Fixed mapcycle problems when the server was playing a map outside of active mapgroup or collection.

* Workshop maps no longer show ""workshop"" prefix on master server and official maps show ""official"" instead of map id when played as part of hosted workshop collection.

* Fixed the post processing effects (like blur) persisting through a level change to the new map if the new map does not contain a postprocess_controller entity.

* Fixed some sv convars so they can be executed via map cfg files

* Fixed the regular radar images not showing on the loading screen for workshop/custom maps

* Fixed an interpolation exploit with bogus update rates.

* Fixed a regression where old protobuf demo files failed to play. All protobuf demos should be playable again.

* Maps that are newly subscribed are now highlighted as NEW in the UI."	t5_2sqho	True

**Edit**: Matt wood posting here with further information:

&gt;Using -processheap will avoid running some code that is currently causing most of the known slowdowns on long-running games. However, the -processheap paths can be overall slower than without, so there's a chance it might cause a different slowdown.
The good thing is that it's is easy to test: just play a game like normal and observe the frame rate, then restart with -processheap and see if there is a significant difference. If the difference is small enough for you, then use it until we get the new update out.
**Once we release an update with the real fixes, you should definitely remove this.**

##And that people understand that it breaks the game and that hopefully more leagues dissallow it in the future.

##**DaZed** explaines it pretty good: 

&gt;There is no reason the end of banana and inferno should be smoked for the entire round, same with catwalk on dust2, cache at middle.

&gt;On train, terrorists throw 3+ smokes/6+ flashes and just rebuy, and the ct's have no counters left.

&gt;On nuke as CT you can smoke squeeky door and rebuy, then just have an extra smoke for hut making the hut impossible to contest for 20 seconds longer during the round.

&gt;On mirage, T's will smoke connector/Window and rebuy. Making middle control extremely easy as T.


&gt;There is no reason teams should dump 4 flashes 2 smokes at long a as t's everyround on dust2, and then rebuy, it is ridiculous.

&gt;T's throw 6 flashes and 3 smokes over middle on cache then rebuy, it's so stupid.

&gt;On season the exact same thing will happen, CT's will throw smokes in middle, and keep it smoked the entire round, then they will throw 6 flashes and 3 smokes over middle as t and rebuy.

&gt;On tuscan/Mill ct's will smoke Cat and middle off and then rebuy.

&gt;it's a ridiculous problem on every single map, and is something that needs to be remedied

&gt;It has been like this in ESEA for an extremely long time and has been abused and makes for terrible, terrible gameplay when it's abused.

##**Xizt**:
&gt;No thanks! The game will only become slower. CT's can lockdown an area of the map until there is like 20 seconds left, for example banana on inferno.

I have recently become interested in CS:GO and the question if valve actually investigates reports sent in. So, I set up 6 accounts with CS:GO on them, I blatantly used speedhacks/aimbot on 5 of the accounts and on the the last account i used simple wallhacks. 

The result of this ""test"" is that the report system does work to some extent. The 5 accounts that used the speed/aimbot were given a 1 year matchmaking cooldown. The account which used wallhacks/legit aim were not given anything despite the reports.

Now this allows ""legit"" cheaters to stay present in the game. If anything I suggest a screenshot system from valve, this allows easy detection for most public wallhacks. As for private cheats, you have to realize that there is no way to detect every cheat on every game/anticheat. I have a friend who constantly cheats on ESEA simply by using nothing but a triggerbot which is hard to detect because it doesn't show up as a visual in the screenshots, and his demos are not sketchy. The only reason ESEA bans anyone is because of their demo system, they do not have a godlike anti-cheat.

I made this to just open the eyes of the CS:GO community. I was tired of seeing ""OMG buy esea it's only solution to playing CS"" as an ongoing topic. Blatant cheaters on CS:GO are being banned just thought I'd let you know :).

TLDR: Valve is banning off of reports but only extremely blatant players are getting banned.

I realize what I'm saying is ""the objective of an objective mode is to complete the objective"" but hear me out.

When the round starts, the CTs are at an advantage (disregarding other factors such as map design). The Ts have to come to them. The responsibility for action rests on the Ts. If nothing is done, the CTs win on round timeout.

What the bomb plant does is completely reverse these roles with a shorter timer. Once the bomb is planted, the Ts are at an immense advantage. It places the responsibility for action on the CTs. If nothing is done after the bomb is planted, clearly the Ts will win. The CTs have to go seek out the bomb, in a well defended bombsite.

tl;dr - planting the bomb is important, and more important than you'd probably think. Use your radar, find it, and plant it. Then feel free to frag away.

EDIT - also remember how small the bomb radius is these days. This means as T you can stay back and prevent ninja defuses more easily. This means as CT you can get closer to try to get exit kills while saving your gun.

EDIT 2 - ALSO ALSO, smoke grenades are EXTREMELY useful in CS:GO to plant or defuse. Defusing especially so if the Ts weren't very vocal about where exactly they were planting it in the site. I was in a stand off as CT once on the ramp near long going up into A bombsite on d2. The remaining T or two (forget) were on cat stairs. We kept trying to peek and shoot the other until finally I threw down a smoke by the boxes and proceeded to defuse the bomb without even getting hit!"	t5_2sqho	True

1360444685.0	187ma3	When is Valve going to listen to us about the hacking issue?	cssplayer	93	15	145	"Hey guys, I've just played several Competitive MM games, and each one of them had at least one blatant hacker.

It seems that almost every day on this subreddit, there is another post about hacking. If you go to the Steam forums for CS:GO, most of the topics are about hacking. My question is, when is valve going to address the issue?

Since CS:GO was released, it seems like the Dev's have gone cold on this issue, and don't comment on it at all. Sure, we now have the report system in CS:GO, which is a nice addition, but it doesn't feel like it does anything.

Every time CS:GO goes on sale, just like it is now, there is another wave of hackers in Competitive MM. It's like clockwork. I know VAC does it's job, but we need something more. I can't even explain the feeling of helplessness and rage when I end up in a match with a speedhacker/wallhacker/aimbotter.

I realize that there's only 200-300 people playing competitive match making at any one point, but we are still valve's customers, and we just ask for a clean match without some insane hacker that keeps rebuying accounts.

I just wish valve would openly talk to us about hacking, and what they have in store to combat it. I can deal with the 64 tick servers, lack of a silencer, single flashbangs, and funny hats on the CT models, but I can't deal with the hacking.

Valve, Please, as a loving customer of yours, talk to us, let us know.

This would greatly increase visibility of player models in the distance, even more so than removing fog completely!	Azzu	89	12	24	"I've just made a ticket about removing the fog (because the previous one was invalid) but while writing it I actually noticed that you could change the fog and use it to even **improve** the visibility of targets in the distance!

The problem is this: in 1.6, all the textures only had one color. The player models always had a different color. This made it *incredibly* easy to spot players in the distance.

Now in CS:GO, the textures are actually detailed. This way, you can't detect models by color anymore, but you have to use the shape. This naturally makes the detection much slower. [Screenshot](http://abload.de/img/csgo2012-09-1101-43-196jxz.jpg)

But what if you would render [no fog over the model](http://abload.de/img/overlaymodelonfogwvuog6k1u.jpg) or just a [little bit of fog](http://abload.de/img/overlaymodelonfogn4uok.jpg)?

This would make the player models **much** easier to see than [with fog](http://abload.de/image.php?img=csgo2012-09-1101-42-55njr9.jpg) but **also** easier than by [removing fog](http://abload.de/img/csgo2012-09-1101-43-196jxz.jpg)!

Please, if you think this is a good idea, [upvote this on the official bug tracker](http://64bitvps.com/csgo/ticket/fog-should-be-changed-so-it-applies-only-partially-to-player-models-this-would-greatly-increase-the-visibility-of-players-in-the-distance/)!

I think this is a much better idea than removing the fog completely.

After seeing the countless posts about not having anyone to play MM with, I decided to throw a steam group together. The idea behind this is to get enough people in it that you can always find a couple of people to jump into a game with. 

[The group page can be found here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CSGOMT).

I currently have a few discussion topics posted for general usage. These include the following:

* [An introduction thread where you can introduce yourself, the hours you play, favorite maps, etc.](http://i.imgur.com/vCkUoxz.png)

* A tips and tricks thread where you can provide feedback to new or inexperienced players.

* A useful tools thread that includes the crosshair generator from the sidebar and a link to useful console commands.

* A videos thread, where you can post your favorite gameplay videos or advertise your stream.

These are open to all members and have room for expansion.

Additionally, I've made event publishing open to all members. I enabled this so you aren't having to awkwardly browse through the members list trying to find someone to play with. Instead, you will be able to publish an event whenever you are free to play and anyone online will know there's a game available to jump in to (in addition to being able to look for open games). 

I'm hoping this can be utilized to help the more lone-wolf type players find a group that can communicate and enjoy playing together (as well as cut down on the looking for group posts). Feel free to join up and please leave any feedback on how this group could be improved."	t5_2sqho	True

I know some people have been disillusioned and sceptical about the effectiveness of reporting but now there's a clear indication of what reporting does.  It must send a report of some description to Valve so every time you see a hacker make sure you report them (press and hold tab, arrow keys to player, enter, report). 

My understanding is that you only need to do it once so that there's no point reporting the same guy over and over. **What we do need to do is make sure everyone in the game reports the hackers** even if they are on your team - be responsible because next time they might be the opposition. if 9 people in the mm game report the same guy it would have to raise flags.

So credit where it's due to Valve, **but now it's onto us to report hackers and to be responsible investigators** (if you are lucky enough to get to review demos)

* Stick to one set of settings, don't change them on a whim or a bad run - playing in a familiar environment helps you being consistent and calm.


* Try to not make any extra moves than necessary - quick switching weapons all the time or ducking is the main thing, but it also covers how you aim and check places, do it once, but properly.

 
* Learn to maintain a proper crosshair position in places, always at the head level - this is map-based since you engage different places with crosshair already properly aligned. Why? You are able to shoot instantly anything comes up, if you think your reflexes can compensate that, think of which action takes the most time: swinging your mouse and clicking or just clicking.


* When strafing vs a guy who is also strafing, shoot him only when he **stops** to shoot - you'll have an easier time, there is lower chance of missing.


* **The most important aspect** of the whole game and FPSes in general: **never, ever shoot before your shot is a guaranteed head/torso hit** - looks pretty obvious, you think? There's more than meets the eye about this and it is the key difference between players and pros. What it basically means: you never go full-auto after you aimed wrongly and you never shoot imperfectly aimed shots. Full-auto has a randomness aspect to it - means you lower your chances of success. You say ""But I have a perfect recoil control!"". No, you're not going to win more encounters vs a guy who puts a bullet or two straight into your head. In close situations it will end with the aiming guy having low hp, but **alive**.    
As for imperfectly aimed shots - you put yourself into position where you either certainly miss or deal less damage than the opponent: he will fight back, you won't have time to fix your error.    
Proper aiming won't come to you fast, since you need to learn aiming right in a low amount of time. Following this procedure though will make your aim improve faster than if you would fall back to full-auto often. That does not mean full-auto is bad which I'm going to discuss next.


* How big of a burst do you shoot and when? It is based on the distance between you and your opponent **and** how much of an opponent is visible.    
*Long range* - like pit to bombsite on dust2 - you should tap (1 bullet). You literally should tap, not click like usual, that way there is less chance that you accidentally shoot two bullet burst - it's about the timing between shots, tapping gives that time-space window where you won't erroneously shoot too early, upping muchly your recoil and defeating the purpose of tapping. If the enemy has only small parts visible (generally hidden behind any kind of boxes and/or ledges) it's also best to tap, even if you are close.    
*Mid range* - two or three burst, not much to say here, the most universal way of shooting, best at mid range.    
*Close range* - here things get slightly tricky, following the previous golden rule, you don't go full-auto without thinking, that all depends on how your enemies are located based on your position. The more of them close to eachother - the longer  the burst. That touches the topic of how should you approach your enemies, which I will cover next.    
There are exceptions to these rules, but only if you really feel confident about your aiming - using one bullet shots on closer distances or longer bursts close. There is also the element of using full-auto while running, close distance - it's a valid method, but only after you properly tried to aim first.    
* How should you approach your enemies?    
First of all, never put yourself at a worse position if you don't have to, example: awper aiming at catwalk from the middle, ct spawn, you at the catwalk, dust2 - you are at a disadvatage, he waits for your appearance, you need to find his exact position. Always try to have the edge, some positions are slightly more favourable than others, examples: pit vs bomsite on dust2 (being in the pit you expose your head, you have space for moving; being on the bomsite you either expose your whole body, or expose head, but have less space to maneuver), another example: middle, dark entrance to b bombsite vs closer catwalk (being in the entrance you expose your legs first, but after that have a clear head view of the opponent, can back rather safely; being on catwalk aiming at the entrance exposes your head first, you can be wallbanged through the ledge, you are additionally exposed to t spawn/far catwalk/t spawn middle). Every map has this quirks, you discover them by playing competitive mode (deathmatch is too fast and crowded).    
Secondly, try to line up your enemies, so only one can aim at you at the time - you will take less damage and have a better chance to kill multiple opponents. Thirdly, always try to have 1v1 fights at a time, isolate opponents - a big help in wining 1v2s and bigger.


Tactical aspects.


* Learn to actively use sound to your advantage, example: when you are close to bombsite and hear c4 being planted, you rush to kill the planter - most of the time you can pinpoint the exact location and he has a very low chance to respond faster than you.    
* Plant the c4 in proper spots depending on how your team chooses to defend the bombsite, examples: planting towards long on bombsite a on dust2 and going to the pit; planting middle/outwards of the bs towards library/kitchen on inferno and going there. Point being, **making the ct as much exposed while defusing as possible**.    
* If you are the one left with c4, always actively think before plant how are you going to defend it and choose your spot accordingly.    
* Don't play greedy - back off if you killed one enemy on a spot you will have a hard time defending by yourself, like long before pit vs enemies coming from t spawn to long on dust2.    
* It's fine to choose more obvious, but safer spots, example: choosing right doors on lower bombsite at nuke with barrels/closed room after planting. Base your decision on the number of enemies and their incoming route.    
* As a ct, pay attention to which spots aren't taken by your teammates and cover them if necessary, normally don't stack a position (exeptions being eco rounds and situations where you are sure enemies are coming that way).

It makes absolutely no sense to have a competitive playlist that;
A) Has Aztec and Dust in it.
B) Has the fog graphical effect.
C) Doesn't have two flashes per person etc

We get it, you don't like ESEA. Stop flooding what was a good sub ~3 weeks ago with random anti-lpkane garbage. It is not relevant content and it is not good content for new readers to read. If you don't like ESEA, cancel your ESEA sub (lpkane even linked to a faq page on it) and move on.

Similarly, the anti-ESEA brigade also destroys real content just because the ESEA News guy's name is on it. The upvote and downvote buttons are NOT for personal opinion, though many of you struggle with this. They are designed for upvoting RELEVANT discussion and information and downvoting IRRELEVANT discussion and information, not downvoting an article because you heard that lpkane is a meanie-pants even though you're not even an ESEA user. If you don't want to support ESEA with clicks, don't click the link, don't click upvote, and don't click downvote. That guy helped support this sub from when it was very small with support and information both ESEA-related and not. Now that the sub is bigger and way more popular, we need to treat it like a bigger and more popular sub, not a tiny circlejerk.

1366941256.0	1d4k33	Why I Like Operation Payback	watchspade	84	18	61	"The great experiment begins. 

Valve is an intensely data-driven company. They've said from the beginning that they track every bullet fired in CS:GO, all kills, all maps played, how they're played…everything. They've hired an economist to help them understand the economies they create within their games. 

So I am completely unsurprised, in fact excited, to see them experiment with different economic game models. A lot of people seem upset (or disappointed) about the latest update and Operation Payback in particular. Operation payback is a for-purchase add-on to CS:GO that adds several community built maps to the official map pool for community casual games, $5 to carry you through the end of July. 

I think this is actually very cool for a number of interesting reasons:

First, community casual is how people are introduced to the game. This is not a feature for the dedicated competitive player, but it *is* a feature for those who want to play casually with more map variety. Spade spouse is one such player who complains about the ""boring"" CS maps… except for Militia. Which she loves. In a small kind of way, flashier maps might entice new players into a game they would not otherwise play, even if it is another $5.

Secondly, Valve needs to start experimenting with ways of driving revenue other than just selling the game, if they're genuinely interested in a free to play future. This strikes me as a nice way to pay (literally) back to the community while also gauging the community's willingness to part with a few bucks for some maps. A few extra maps in casual happens to be the kind of pay-to-play feature that doesn't change how the game is balanced AT ALL, the way skins or weapon mods would. 

Thirdly, community casual is a great proving ground for maps. People say they want new competitive maps, but they really want new competitive maps they already know. This is a way to inch towards that goal. The map gets to be play tested like crazy for balance, etc, while at the same time becoming generally familiar to the community. If and when it is time to propose it as a competitive option, it will already have the WD-40 of community familiarity. 

Fourth and finally, I LOVE that I have the option to pay the map makers. These guys have a skill that is frankly way beyond me, and I am happy to support hem with a few bucks. Props to FMPONE of our own community for being top of the list with Museum. "	t5_2sqho	True

- Dedicated servers hosting workshop maps now record previously hosted collection information. This allows workshop servers to keep operating when steam servers are down.

- Old versions of workshop maps now properly remove themselves from disk when the map gets renamed.

- If a server is running a map group and has mp_endmatch_votenextmap set to 1, players vote for the next map at the end of the match



- Fixed a regression where leaderboards were sometimes not getting updated for classic competitive mode.

- Added concommand tv_time_remaining that prints how much time is remaining to the broadcast after the match has ended. This provides admins a method to confirm that the broadcast is complete before changing the level.

- Round backup files now correctly strip workshop path when expanding %map% pattern token.

- Round backups now correctly restore player team assignments even when restoring backup from other match half or from halftime.

- Round backups support restoring match in overtime phase.

- mp_warmup_end can now only be called if in warmup.

- Team changes in warmup now take effect immediately.



- Added built-in game rules for resolving tied competitive matches in overtime periods.

- Overtime convars:

- mp_overtime_enable - match will go to overtime if tied in regulation time.

- mp_overtime_maxrounds( default 6 ) - sets number of rounds for overtime, teams switch sides halfway through the overtime.

- mp_overtime_startmoney( default 10000 ) - sets starting money for each overtime half.

- mp_overtime_halftime_pausetimer - when enabled will turn on another convar mp_halftime_pausetimer after tied regulation time and after each overtime half which would require match server admin/bot to set mp_halftime_pausetimer to zero when teams are ready to proceed."	t5_2sqho	True

### MISC

* Added the ability to commend and report players from the player details view that can be accessed in the scoreboard.
* Number of competitive wins, and unique commendations are now shown in the main menu along with skill group.
* Competitive scoreboard will show number of competitive wins needed to display your skill group if you have not displayed it yet. 
* Fixed movement on ladders ignoring the walk button. Now climbing ladders while holding walk is slow and silent, which fixes previous exploit of being able to climb ladders at fullspeed without making sound.
* Fixed failure to fire after weapon switching away from a reload and back (fake-reloading).
* Whitelisted tv_password convar to set GOTV password.
* Reduced fps in main menu when not connected to a server from 300 fps to 120 fps to help with laptops and desktop video cards doing excessive work. Exposed fps_max_menu convar to control fps in main menu.
* Added one more minute of grace period for players to reconnect to their competitive match before a cooldown for failing to reconnect is assigned. Cooldown for failing to reconnect is now assigned after player has remained disconnected for at least 4 minutes, not counting the round of disconnection and not counting the round in which 4 minutes grace period elapses.
* Fixed Hammer crash on exit.
* Added some holiday cheer.

***

Rumor has it:

* **Attention server operators: servers with SourceMod/MetaMod will not boot. For the time being, disable SM/MM and your server should boot.** From the AlliedModders forums:

&gt;Some major things in the engine changed. This will not be a quick fix.

Expect to run without SM/MM for some time.

* **Improved menu screen**

* **A number based rating (1387, 1621, 2148, etc) system instead of badges**

* **In-game team assembly and Team vs. Team matchmaking (similar to ranked 5v5 in League of Legends and Dota 2)**

* **In-game team and playing rankings leaderboard**

* **Automatic replay system (with match IDs like Heroes of Newerth) + Live game viewer + tournaments list like Dota 2**

* **Comprehensive player statistics + player profiles (like Dota 2) that allow people to see recent games which is helpful for finding replays**
* **Integrating leagues into the client**

* **Push to talk button in the lobby. Generally when playing with friends I use a client like Vent. We're forced to talk in-game while waiting for a match to be found, or else our voices are transmitted twice. -BigKahuna_Burger**

* **After a competitive match, take everyone that wants a rematch and put them in queue together and just fill in the gaps of the people that declined. -pooka12321**

* **Steam Workshop for maps and models and game modes -K1ng_K0ng**

* **Karma/commend system similar to ESEA and Dota 2 -ammuench**


This is just basic functionality that almost every other recent game has at this point. Please devs of CS:GO make everyone's experience easier and more enjoyable by adding these things.

To be honest, i don't this think idea of ESEA = keeping cs alive is true. If anything, it's keeping us stagnant and holding us back. 

I know this is a huge reach, but ever since ESEA became the premier/last league standing, CS has been in the absolute gutter competitively. There are FAR BIGGER reasons than ESEA as to why that is true, but consider this. In the 3~ years since ESEA has become #1, the community has consistently gotten smaller/less competitive, not the other way around. What makes you think them staying the #1 league will all of the sudden create a 180 and revitalize the community? It won't, competitive CS needs a change. 

Look, i'm not saying ESEA is physically stopping us as a community from growing, i'm saying it's potentially created a situation that is not ideal for it, or influenced the community into becoming stagnant. 

There is this huge misconception that the more money there is at the top end, the bigger the community will become = more money, rinse and repeat. This is true, but people heavily skew how the cycle is supposed to start. An extra 50000 in prize money won't get that 15 year old bf3 player to switch over, it won't even get a mid high level FPS player to switch over. It is literally just that, money for the top end. This effects less than 1 percent of the competitive population. 

CS has to grow first competitively and publicly, A LOT of it will have to do with valve, but as a community (namely as an ESEA community) we aren't helping. If ESEA goes down i predict less monetarily heavy leagues like CEVO, CAL etc. will start springing up again gaining in popularity. Leagues that may suffer from lower quality AC (how do you even know how good an AC is?) and what not, but will appeal highly to the younger, newer generation jsut getting into FPS competitively. Things like servers/vent/team sites will start getting out sourced. mIRC will gain momentum again and the community will migrate to new forums. Sites may emerge dedicated solely to news and whatnot (gotfrag) and the community overall will not be completely dependent on one overpriced service that ran a monopoly that little kids could never pay for. and you know what, when the old methods re emerge again, shit's gonna be done RIGHT. because this time we care, this time we don't take it for granted, and this time we know what mistakes were made. and you know what, it may fail miserably, but i'd take my chances over dieing a slow death with ESEA. have some fucking faith guys, look deep inside your competitive heart and ask yourself, as a average/high average player, will you quit CS GO if ESEA goes down? Fuck no. "	t5_2sqho	True

1351513177.0	129s5o	Shoutcasters shouldn't miss kills anymore	Charles_K	75	10	21	"[My steam post about shoutcasters and the new GOTV](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2986298)

GOTV reintroduces the ""full map"" display to Counter-Strike spectators once again. As far as I'm concerned, no one really cared for its introduction way back in 1.6 or 1.4 or whatever. However, with the new additions and changes made to the whole spectating system in CS:GO, even amateur casters shouldn't be missing nearly as many kills as they have been in the past. Here's why:

*Number Switching*
CS:GO allows you to quickly switch to a SPECIFIC player's point of view by simply pressing that player's corresponding ""number"". Team 1's players are numbered 1-5 while Team 2's players are numbered 6-0. You can actually test this out yourself by joining a 5v5 game (matchmaking, Demolition, etc.) and pressing the number keys while you're dead. This neat feature is why voting in servers with plugins gets glitchy when you're dead (the plugin is conflicting with the game's built-in spectating system).

*Full Map Display &amp; Hotkey*
The full map display obviously displays the entire map. This includes the players **and** their **corresponding player numbers**. Plus, the full map display is easily togglable (unlike in CS 1.6), thanks to its simple CTRL hotkey. All this means that spectators can now do the following:

* 1. When the round is in freezetime, hold TAB to show the players' economy. Take this time to see if they are playing eco round or buying out, etc.
* 2. When the round starts, press CTRL for the full map display.
* 3. By doing the step above, the caster now can see the entirety of where each and every player is going. Because of this, *he can more easily anticipate where action is going to occur* **without** flipping through individual player cameras like a madman (and thus, disorienting viewers and newcomers to the game...). Also, he can easily switch to whichever player he wants to watch *in a single click, thanks to the players having corresponding numbers displayed both in the full map display and in their healthbars* (the 5 bars that show on each side of the spectator cam).


Overall, casters shouldn't be missing so many kills AND no longer need to seizurifically flip through player cameras before encounters and whatnot.

I don't know if this thread was even needed. I haven't seen any recent matches yet, but I've heard casters are already utilizing the new draw features and whatnot very well, which puts a smile to my face!

Cheers! "	t5_2sqho	True
1351220625.0	123s6t	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update for late 10/25/12 (10/26/12 UTC, 1.21)	wickedplayer494	72	6	56	"Via the csgo_servers mailing list:

### SPECTATING

- **Resurrected SourceTV as 'GOTV.'**
- Added a map overview that displays players, events, grenade detonations, etc. Can be drawn on in a select-able colored pen when spectating or if the ""sv_competitive_official_5v5"" convar is set to 1 on the server or if the client convar ""mapoverview_allow_client_draw"" is set on the client (drawings are not currently networked to other players).
- Added free camera to spectator modes cycle.
clamped hud_scaling to 0.95.
- Added convar 'cl_spec_show_bindings' that toggles the visibility of the spectator key bindings.
- Added spectator ability to toggle competitive scoreboard player data using the 'drop' command.
- Extended team clan name support to the Team Select Screen. To use team clan name, all humans should match their Team name in Games-&gt;Settings, or the server admin can use the 'mp_teamname_1' and 'mp_teamname_2 convars.'
- After halftime, teams no longer switch sides visually on the spectator screen, they now stay where they are and the team colors switch instead.
- Created a server convar that lets you swap the default player side position manually (CTs on right and T's on left) called mp_spec_swapplayersides.
- Made the hotkey that's assigned to jump to a player not change after half-time.
- You can now display a country flag next to your custom team name on the spectator scoreboard by setting ""mp_teamflag_1/2"" to ISO Alpha-2 country code of the country you want to display.
 
### CLASSIC COMPETITIVE 

- Introduced ""Skill Groups"", the new Skill Group emblems are now visible in the main menu and at the end of a competitive match. A players' Skill Group will be displayed after they achieve at least 10 competitive match wins.
- Reworked conditions of valid match leaving: A vote to concede becomes available to the team that lost a player. Otherwise the match continues.
- Number of players searching for a competitive match will display number of players compatible with the game type selected by player, for example players searching for ""Dust II"" will see a number of players searching for ""Dust II"" + ""Defuse Mission"", players searching for ""Defuse Mission"" will see sum of all players searching for ""Defuse Mission"" or any specific defuse map, and so on.
- Estimated wait time for a competitive match now more accurately displays wait time based on the game type selected by player.

### SERVER ADMINISTRATION

- Added Save/Restore of match state.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file [fileprefix]' -- If set then server will save all played rounds information to files with this prefix. Backup file contains players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades and match score for first and second halves. In a case of a tournament server crash backup file can be loaded using ' mp_backup_restore_load_file'. The default is 'backup'
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_last' -- Every time a backup file is written the value of this convar gets updated to hold the name of the backup file.
    -Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_list_files [number]' -- Lists recent backup round files matching the prefix, most recent files first, accepts a numeric parameter to limit the number of files displayed (default 5).
   - Added concommand 'mp_backup_restore_load_file [filename]' -- Loads the specified backup file and applies players information like KDA, MVPs, cash, kevlar, helmet, defuse kit, weapons and grenades; sets the match score for first and second half and starts next round.
   - Added convar 'mp_backup_round_file_pattern,' that defines the pattern for naming backup files using tokens. Example: %prefix%_%date%_%time%_%team1%_%team2%_%map%_round%round%_score_%score1%_%score2%.txt. The default pattern results in 'backup_roundNN.txt'
- Whitelisted 'mp_logdetail' convar.
- Added convar 'sv_damage_print_enable', that determines whether damage given and received is visible in the console after a player is killed.
- Added 'cl_bobcycle' to 'sv_competitive_minspec'. It's now restricted to the defauklt 0.98 on servers that have 'sv_competitive_minspec' enabled.
- Made all server cash_ convars notify players when they are changed.
- Servers running with sv_pausable 1 will now correctly display 'server paused' UI element on clients when server is paused using 'pause' command.
- Added mp_spectators_max convar to control how many spectators are allowed in a match.
- Added convar mp_halftime_pausetimer that will indefinitely pause the halftime timer.
- Added convar mp_warmup_pausetimer that will pause the warmup period indefinitely. 
 * Warmup periods shorter than 6 seconds cannot be paused.
 
### PERFORMANCE

- Performance improvements for users running on AMD systems.
- Fixed a major performance problem for users running Bitdefender antivirus software.
 
### BUG FIXES

- Fixed two crashes that could happen if you were on a team and went to spectator team.
- Fixed the timer display on the hud still showing even when the bomb was planted.
- Fixed avatar scaling issues on the spectator hud as well as the issues that would place the player slot avatars offset some distance from where they should be.
- Made some adjustments to the specttor UI and regular hud to account for hud_scaling set really high.
Fixed a really bad bug where going from the lobby to a game could prevent players from having input. This would result in not being able to select a team or move around.
- Changed flashbang visual effect in Spectator mode so that it is updated when the target changes."	t5_2sqho	True

Description and Info below.	tweeday	71	5	139	"Heya there guys, my name is Kevin Tweedale - more known via the alias i put myself with on the internet since 2007 ""tweeday"". I have been playing competitively in the 1. Division of the ESL Amateur Series back in the days, that's about it when it comes to my playing ""career"". 

Back in the days i started watching for instance the Surreal series, the KODIAK series and decided this is what i would like to do in the future. 
I started making videos, slowly but surely grew myself and nowadays i am working nearly 24/7 to get up videos, to do projects and to serve videos not only for the public but also for clients.

eSports wise i have worked with a couple of organisations thus far, being employed from 2011 on to the end of 2012 by mTw Sports Limited, now i am working since around 3 months for NiP Gaming (Ninjas in Pyjamas) and i really feel so comfortable around them.

I have expierenced around 25 events thus far, many of them being ESL organised tournaments such as Intel Friday Night Games, EPS Finals in Berlin and Cologne, Intel Saturday Night Games, RaidCall EMS One Spring/Summer Finals, Copenhagen Games 2012 / 2013, DreamHack Summer 2013, Prague Challenge 2013, Gamescom 2011 / 2012 and i did numerous video jobs for companies such as One.de, ROCCAT, Nvidia, WarGaming, BenQ, SteelSeries etc etc, some of them also got displayed at Gamescom 2012. That is about it a short introduction to what i do and where i found my passion in which is the Counter-Strike franchise to this point.

As Styko did an AMA earlier this week i thought i'd give it a try and see if people are interested, if not it's fine aswell!

My YouTube channel is located at http://www.youtube.com/Mrtweeday if you would want an insight of what i do with CS:GO in general.

1349149297.0	10srxa	Competitive Matchmaking is the goddamn best things to happen to this game.	b1uestarfish	83	17	91	"This addition does so much for the game:  
*Competitive are now structured as actual competitive matches. No drop-ins, no empty games, etc.  
*Some say that the drop-outs ruing the mode because there are no ringers. The thing is, with ELO and the 30 min penalty, this should become less of a problem. If you exit a game, your only option(for regular play) will be the same server or a casual server. BRINGING ME TO MY NEXT POINT  
*Casual is becoming more relevant. If you have 15 mins to play CS, play casual. That's what the gamemode is for. Only play Competitive if you are prepared.  
*Within my first round of competitive, I joined a team that I played with for 7 games and we will play later too. These are guys I never met. Moreover, when we saw that one opponent was left out of all the rq's we added him to the group. We played 6 vanilla cs games with a team complete with mics calling strats.  
*We LOST several times and we never rolled anyone. This was a big problem with the game. 60% of the time, the score would be 16-2 before. This is no longer the case.  
*When ELO is added, I could see this as a big competitor to services like ESEA. I might no longer have to pay a subscription for features that can and should be standard and a modern competitive FPS.  

**This is without question my favorite update.** The game suddenly seems so much more balanced. Thank you for powering through the criticism and delivering, valve. If you have not played the update yet, why are you reading my essay instead of enjoying this game?

I guess first of all I will introduce myself. My name is Amir ""KIRE"" Khair and I am an invite player for ESEA, as well as a committed streamer. I stream CSGO probably 4-5 days a week for 6 hours each time. I enjoy playing Match-Making with my viewers, as well as just pugging, streaming my ESEA matches etc. Anyways, for those of who you might know my stream, I have been able to make a decent amount of donations, and in the past I've used them for more hardware and gaming peripherals, as well as give-away things for my stream. This time around though, I am trying to do something a bit nicer and more charitable.

**Since its a reddit post, Ill just go ahead and rant a little. Skip to the bottom for all the big details if you'd like.**

&gt; About 13 years ago, my uncle who got me into gaming [always playing with me, getting me the newest consoles, upgrading my PC along the way with me] was diagnosed with non hodgkin's lymphoma. He has been fighting for 13 years now, and is approaching his final months or so we've been told. My mom went to go see him, and I frankly, felt really bad that I was just sitting at home and playing video games [even though it was at his request I didnt visit him in this condition]. 

&gt; So sitting and thinking while I was in a death match. I decided I would stream a ton over the next month, and try to raise some money for cancer awareness. I found a charity I really like, and I've donated to in the past, called Fuck Cancer. The website is www.letsfcancer.com - Anywho basically my goal is to raise 500.00 over the next month. I will also be matching the donation amount I recieve up to 500.00. So in reality, my goal is to raise 500.00 via you, the stream viewers, and then match it with some money I've put aside and donate 1000.00 to the Fuck Cancer Charity. I realize that not all of you are in positions to donate, but I still wanted to have a 24 hour stream, and post here so that I can reach a big viewer base :D


So where I am left is with my 1st of 3, 24 hour streams. I will pretty much do anything and everything to stay awake. I'll be playing in ESEA PUGs, Public Servers, Death Match, Match Making with friends, Match Making with viewers, I'll do a few give-aways of free games or gaming hardware like mice and mousepads - and just interacting with the chat as much as possible.

* www.esea.net/users/1131 

* 24 Hour Stream @ 7/26 [Starting between 8am-10am CST depending on when I wake up]

* All donations will go towards Cancer research and the total, upto 500.00 USD will be matched by myself [I will collect all donations until August 31st and then match/donate it all]

* I will be playing games with viewers, esea pugs, scrims, and I will try to have some north american invite players come in and answer some questions and play with viewers as guests [ some members from curse, as well as some other players] 

* I realize im not the best professional in the league - But if you'd like to ask any questions, I have a great sense of the game at the upper level and I'm always down to help out. I also have some pretty hard rage moments [which most people really enjoy laughing at, so im just gonna go with it.]"	t5_2sqho	True

Etherfast	77	15	35	"Some of them are really common sense, but I feel that many of the people that are making the switch from community servers or classic casual need a small guide to step up their game.

You should read these if you want to improve your play or game sense, and I hope it will be a fun/easy read for the most advanced players as well.


**Get a working microphone, or if you already have one, use it** - One of the most important things in the game is voice communication. Use the microphone properly, and this has a few subpoints of it own.

* Don't use your native language, even if you're queueing with co-nationals. Think about the rest of the party and use a language commonly known to both sides (English is a good pick).
* Don't shout, don't harass people or abuse them in any way. You're not there to critique somebody else's gameplay, even if they made a bad call at some point.
* Make calls, and I can't stress this enough. The target is to share as much information as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. You don't want to spam the microphone with pointless information, but you need to tell others the action/position/weapon/HP left. Nobody likes a person that died somewhere on the map and doesn't share any kind of information about what happened.
* Don't be a backseat player. If you died and you're spectating someone else, stop telling them what to do obsessively. It's annoying to everyone and it doesn't help as much as you think.
* In clutch situations, keep voice communications to a minimum. 1vsX situations are very tense and the remaining player needs to pay attention to as many game details as he can. 


**Work together as a team** 

* Learn what and when to buy. I've already covered this in a past [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1gwmq7/people_really_need_to_learn_when_and_what_to_buy/)
* When attacking, listen to other people's calls and strategies, even if they sound stupid at first. Even the most basic strategy (e.g. Rush a bombsite on an eco-round) can be successful if everyone commits to it. You can make the difference between a failed attempt of taking an area of the map and a successful attempt.
* When defending, do as many calls as you can to help your teammates rotate effectively. Even a second matters in such a rotation.
* Don't switch map positions when defending before telling anyone. By default, your teammates will expect you to play the same position, and have their backs covered.
* The 5v5 Competitive usually is played with 1 AWPer the most. Make sure you announce your intention of buying the AWP and the position you want to play with it. Buying two AWPs in a round is as uncommon as it is impractical.
* Everything goes as long as it's agreed upon and everyone commits to it. If you want to rush them in close-quarters with shotguns, then so be it, but make sure everyone agrees before proceeding.
* Decide with your alive teammate(s) when to save your weapons and when to attempt a re-take. 
* When splitting up and going for picks, double-up your teammate and watch his back. Don't bait him in any way and help him when in need. 

LE: Baiting is the process of falling intentionally behind while your teammate takes the lead. This way, you don't get surprised by any enemies and when your friend gets picked, you know exactly where everyone is.


**Know the game, improve your game sense**

* Unless decided otherwise, play the objective. For example, the CTs should defend the bomb sites, not rush the Ts in their spawn zone. The T's are expected to attack the bombsites, not camp until the time runs out, etc.
* Always watch the timer and act accordingly. If the bomb is down and there are just a couple seconds left on the clock, making it impossible to plant, hide and play the time-game, don't risk getting picked and lose the round.
* Judge based on your teammates calls which areas of the map are safe and which are potential threats. Know what corners to peak.
* Learn the maps, the [map calls](http://re.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1hjkoy/i_created_comprehensive_callout_overviews_for_the/), the common choke points, the boost spots, the angles you can peek or get peeked from.


**Personal training and development**

* If you play with people you like, add them as friends, play with them more and connect with them as much as possible. Playing with pleasant, team-oriented people has a good positive impact on the result of the game, as opposed to playing with rogue/aggressive players nobody likes.
* Practice as much as possible. Practice your aim and train your muscle memory. There are many dedicated subjects on the matter, so I'm not going to cover them now, but basically ""practice makes perfect"".

1372025134.0	1gxj12	My simple guide that will make you a successful terrorist.	ViZion94	75	13	43	"My guide on being a successful terrorist. 

**Terrorists when taking a bombsite**

 * Your objective is to either kill all the counter terrorists or to get the bomb down and run down the timer. The latter is the choice you should aim for.
 * The person with the bomb should never enter a site first because if the guys behind you get stuck or someone in the pack stops and the rest of you are blind the person in front will be dead while everyone else falls back. Simple stuff.
 * **Flashes** and **Smokes** should be used efficiently.
 * **Flashes** are for one of two things: Faking a site, taking a site. What this means is that either flash and go to another site while the CTs rotate, or flash and go go go. Some of you may be saying ""Well the CTs will just turn from the flashes"". Sure some will but remember, some won't. If they are blind, it is an easy kill for you, IF they aren't blind, they had to turn from the flash which also means they have to turn again to re-adjust their aim. This is when you kill them because some people aren't very good at readjusting their aim as quickly.
 * **Smokes** The concept seems simple enough but people misuse smokes even though smokes are the most useful things you can buy for $300. Use smokes to block off a point of view so you only have to fight one CT rather than 2 or 3. **For Example:** When taking B site at de_dust2, smoke off stairs on B platform. This is because you will most likely only have to worry about the CT in closet and car and then the guy on platform or site later. This smoke also has another use which is to run through it just in case there is an awper right behind double doors B trying to pick people off.
 * **Smoke choke point entrances** For example places like B double doors. This is because no CT wants to run through a smoke which causes them to delay their retake.
 * Aim to check all common spots before planting the bomb and get the bomb down as soon as possible before CT's start rotating.

**Once the bomb is Down**

 * Once the bomb is down **HIDE SOMEWHERE AND DON'T YOU DARE PEEK**
I say this because if you are peeking you can get picked off one by one by an awper who is waiting for someone to peek them and all of a sudden an easy 3 vs 2 has become a not so easy 2 vs 2.
 * **Re-smoke the spots that the smoke has expired.**
 * **Counter flash whenever the CTs flash to try and re-take the bombsite**
 * **Trade Kills** Work a crossfire or set up some angles where the counter terrorist can't aim easily after the first kill
**For Example:** Terrorists get bomb down at A plat on de_dust2, get one to hide on goose and another on the plat behind boxes without peeking. If a CT comes through cat and gets close on plat to peek the guy on goose, once he starts shooting at the guy on goose the T on plat can easily kill him because the CT has his back turned. Best case scenario: both survive with a CT dead. Worst case scenario: 1:1 trade.
 * **WORK THE BOMB TIMER** If you are hidden the CTs have to take their time to re-take a site so if you are hidden, the CTs cannot kill you therefore they have to work the site even slower because they have to be extra cautious when taking the site, this kills time and the closer the bomb gets to going Ka-Boom.

Edit: I have read the criticism and I do agree with many of you that peeking is definitely situational. I didn't really think too deeply on the subject as I didn't really want to go too in-depth because the guide would have ended up being way too long. I will try to add onto the guide below me by addressing some of the more key points that I have missed! Also thank you for all those that have contributed in any sort of way (if I use one of your tips to add onto this guide I mean you).

My advice is that you can also always use the element of surprise to your advantage.
Quick peeking or also known as shoulder peeking (You peek for a split second and hide for map control and location of CTs) is good for slowing down the enemy which is beneficial depending on the numbers alive on your team and the CTs.

**Important thing about smokes that everyone should know**

 *  Never run through one because the people on the other side can see you coming through the smoke before you can see anything by a big margin.

**Other things to take note**

 * A ""simple rush case"" is not always the go to strat because there are many smokes that can be thrown before entering a site that can give a big advantage and some good pop flashes that can be utilized to give you a big advantage. **For Example:** On de_nuke for taking upper, one can smoke off mini garage before even entering through the squeaky or hut and if you know the pop flashes from T roof it can also be a big advantage to pop flash the CTs on rafters. This is an example of a set up take which requires people to be in certain spots at certain times and a good timed execution in order to be successful. I did not put this into the guide initially because well lots of people play MM alone and there usually aren't many people that are willing to comply with you. 

 * Use your spawn especially as a Terrorist to your advantage. A good spawn where a majority of your team is at the closest possible position to a bombsite is very beneficial because you will be able to get a possible peek position quicker than a CT. My favourite example of this as an awper is if you have the hill spawn on Terrorist side closest possible to Long. You are able to reach the peek spot at long double doors to the long corner before a CT can where if you have quick enough reflexes you will be able to get the CT almost any round the decide to push up.

Arguably, the things that cost the ongoing subscription money ($7/month) to ESEA are:

* 128 tick servers, where a 10 players server has at most $70/month of subscriptions to help it run. Of course you have people with ESEA week passes, hence the ""at most"".
* Admins (whether for manual bans or otherwise)
* ""Industry leading"" anti-cheat client and updates
* Leagues and tournaments (tournaments with cash prizes)

In terms of market targets, thus catering for the competitive player, ESEA does:

* Tournament rules settings (2 flashes, round timer, _se maps)
* Tournament non-official maps (if someone knows, do the community map makers for things like mill/cache/mirage get paid by ESEA?)

**Valve**

What Valve have to do at the moment (which you paid $7-$15 depending on whether you bought it on sale or not):

* Develop and balance the game (development costs)
* Run literally thousands of official servers (64 tick)
* Limited admin-ing of servers: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21916548/Ban1.png

For Valve's target market, catering for new players to experience a variety of game-modes including 5v5 PUGs:

* 1 flash/player in competitive
* Increased round timers
* Fog on official maps (although mirage has similar fog settings to official maps, lets not start another fog debate but here is an analysis: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2863721&amp;highlight=fog)
* Slower implementation of competitive maps to the map pool (although mirage and other maps are incoming)

&gt; Adding new maps to compMM would be good,but we want to learn from OP[Operation Payback]. Which of these maps would YOU like to see in in cmpMM?

https://twitter.com/matttwood/

&gt; We're going to make Mirage an official map, but we're still working on it.

https://twitter.com/csgo_dev

**What players (most of us) want**

Players want as much as they can, for as little cost as possible. ESEA costs a monthly subscription but offers the best service for the competitive player. Valve had to develop the game, and at the moment demands a one-off cost to their players to use their servers indefinitely, but offers a sub-optimal experience to the competitive player, although arguably an accessible experience for the new player.

You see a LOT of threads and posts saying the same thing. What it seems to boil down to, in my mind, is that people want what ESEA does, for free. Or some part of what ESEA does.

So basically, do we expect Valve as a business to subsidise their CS:GO service from other parts of their business. Since there is no other ongoing revenue generation for Valve through CS:GO **at the moment**, and each purchase only scales with number of buyers, and not with time like a subscription would. Looking at it this way, the question of why doesn't Valve offer everything ESEA offers, is the same as why isn't ESEA free? Economic realities and market segmentation. Which is fine, we get choice, and there are probably countless other parties offering these services in a fluid market, you might just have to pay for what it you are willing to pay, and the services will have to charge at least what it costs them to survive."	t5_2sqho	True

1348578098.0	10g47q	Lets talk new maps	SaltTM	76	13	71	"People love classic maps and some people dislike the changes valve did with the classic maps (ie.: nuke), but I'm a person who feels like we need a whole new batch of 'de_' maps to grow personally to keep the game fresh and interesting. (I know we've adapted mirage/nuke_ve)

I'd like to state I'm not a mapper and my knowledge around mapping is limited, but I feel like this is a subject we need to talk about to keep going forward with the game.  I have a handful of questions for the community regarding new maps:

1. **Do we have any known mappers from this community or other communities working or planning to work on csgo maps?**  I know we have [Brute](http://brutesmaps.com/featuredmaps.html), who made Tuscan and Russka, [plans](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=436181#n1) on porting a few of his old maps and making brand new ones.  We also know **Volcano** is [working on](https://twitter.com/SalGarozzo/status/243804410109632513) his own map de_cache before modifying train/inferno.

2. **Are there [any maps](http://gamebanana.com/csgo/maps/cats/7125) that you've seen/played on that the community should be looking at?** If yes, what maps and why?

3. **Would it be appropriate to hold a mapping event just to motivate people to create new maps (not ports)?** Following with lets say an invite tournament with the winning maps of the competition for people to scrim/pug on and work from there?  eg.: Teamliquid [did this before](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=296164) and that's how tournament maps started appearing on the sc2 ladder, I feel like we should start in this direction maybe?

4.  **What is your stance on the current maps?** Are they good enough to keep the game interesting until we get more maps in the future?

5. **Any other thoughts about the subject?**"	t5_2sqho	True
1345390378.0	yh3nv	My thoughts on CS:GO from a player of 10 years, looking for your opinions as well.	shinrikyou	86	24	94	"I'm a CS player since 1.5 though I have barely touched it in the last 3 years, spent most of my time in Source but dominated the game back in 1.6 as well. Did plenty of competitive gaming back in the day too, the usual ladders, some tournaments, the works. Joined GO since the beta opened up. Here's my take on it, please give me your input and opinions on this because this game is confusing the hell out of me:

The good:

- Headshots are harder to land compared to CSS at least, makes the game more skill based.
- Weapons are overall more balanced, lessens the domination of the usual M4/AK/AWP/DEAGLE since they're all pretty much viable versus each other inside their own strenghts.
- The game is damn solid, especially for a beta.
- Classic CS gameplay is still there, unlike in games like BF and COD that went all the way awry from their origins.
- The remake of the maps is beautifully done, in both visuals and gameplay elements.
- The new weapons are a great adiction, and mix up the classic experience a bit.

The bad:

- Spray and pray seems more viable than ever before outside long ranges. Most weapons can still empty their magazines at medium ranges and still hit enough bullets to kill someone as long as you're not going full-blown retard and do it while on the move and jumping.
- As a side effect of the increased eye candy, models became much harder to tell apart from each other and the enviroment wich makes for frustrating gameplay at various times when you get killed by someone who you just can't see at all.
- By the above, and possibly as a side effect of people still adjusting to the slightly different gameplay, servers without some kind of AWP restriction are becoming a serious problem in my opinion. It's no fun when you can't turn a corner and have at least one or two players sighted in you already, all the time. Might just be my bad luck so far, but I've always hated AWP restrictions and right now I feel they're a must because for whatever reason, everyone just seems to be taking the easy way in the game and camp their hearts out with their instagib while the attacking team is pretty much required to be Neo in order to survive.

These are the only major gripes I have with the game, these are all problems that I'm seeing for the first time in the series wich is what's messing with me. I'm finding myself having to re-learn to play CS (wich is also good in a way), but I feel that not so much for the right reasons that the gameplay evolved in a good way, as to the bad ones that people playing simply seem dumber and are getting away with it. The thing in beeing able to distinguish models kind of comes with the turf since we can't keep 1.6/Source graphics forever, but the artwork could have been done in a different way to make the game more forgiving in something that is unrelated to player skill.

However, I have been out of the loop by the 3 years I mentioned, almost 4 really. I'm looking for some veteran 1.6 and Source player's opinions as well to compare to my own. While I overall like GO and think it's a good evolution of the series without turning it into something that's not the core CS experience, this is the 4th versionf of CS I'm going through and the first one to leave me completely divided in a bit of a love-hate relationship. Overall gameplay feels solid but gun gameplay seems random and a lot more forgiving, like we went from 'who can zero in on the enemy's head best' to 'who can empty the gun faster'."	t5_2sqho	True

1376056435.0	1k0x0o	Demo Browser v3.0	eNzyy	80	20	65	"CHANGELOG:

* Added ability to delete demos
* Added ability to rename demos
* Added ability to smart rename demos
* Added a menu bar at the top
* Added a few more settings
* Able to open your demo/cfg folder from the menu
* Can now use a custom CS:GO directory
* When you right click a demo, a context menu should show

COMING:

* Hopefully full parsing of the demo file to get the players, players scores and round scores (with help from [Glorious](/u/Glorious-G))
* Full release of the source
* Proper design of the application
* Automatic demo recording (I'm still undecided on how I want to do this so it might not make it to release)

---

## What it does
It allows you to view and sort all of your demo files without having to faff about in the CS:GO directory or ingame console. Allows you to launch and play the demo from within the application.

Any inputs you change in the settings (res, fullscreen, demoui) will be saved!

---

## Usage
In order to use this you MUST set the steam directory (and for custom game directory the Counter-Strike:Global Offensive directory). I've used the ""default"" location but if you have a custom directory you WILL need to set it! Once you've set the directory the list will populate with demos in your CS:GO folder. Double click a demo to have it launch &amp; play.

---

## Smart Renamer

This automatically renames your file based on a set of elements entered in the settings panel (Default: Ty-M-Ti-Tk) using the default the filename would be (eg.) GOTV-de_dust2_se-46mins-128tick.dem

* Ty - Type (GOTV or POV)
* M - Map
* Ti - Time (Xmins)
* Tk - Tickrate (Xtick)

If you don't want one of these elements in the filename just remove it, each element MUST be seperated with a hypen (-)

The seperator in the settings will be what character is used to seperate each element in the filename when it gets renamed!

Imo this is the best way of getting players and more followers on tournaments (just look at LoL,Dota2) both f2p and they are the most played games atm.It will surely do the game good, but i'm not sure how it will affect the players, Valve should come up with a great anti-cheat so hackers won't storm this game making new accounts everytime their main gets banned...

What do you guys think?And since i'm sure that valve won't allow any refunds, how would they compensate us for the money we spent on it? League of Legends-like skin system?Only cosmetically changing the appearance of the models but it won't affect any actual play?"	t5_2sqho	True

I was placed on a team with 4 125+ pinging players and two of them were blatantly wallhacking. Obviously the other team realizes this and they start to discuss it in mm1. Also recognizing this, I join in on the discussion. A few rounds later the cheaters and their two friends start a Kick vote for me and then just boot me. Come on now Valve. You've developed a system for blatant cheaters to not only ruin a game for the other team, but you're allowing them to just bounce any player they want to for any reason, or lack there of, they want to. 


What will it take for them to realize that they are stunting the growth of their own product? Or do they simply not care? It gives me great hope for the future of modern CS when they do patches based on the wants of the community, but they seem to be content with throwing the rest of their good will out the window with their incredibly ass-backwards design.

For reference: I'm a Legendary Eagle Master. I haven't been able to progress past this despite being a long time competitive player because nearly every game I play in my skill range is plagued by cheaters."	t5_2sqho	True

After the success of the reddit cup, I'm pleased to announce the launch of the TNP CSGO Arena. What is the GO Arena? Read on.

* TNP Gaming would like to present you with our new and REVOLUTIONARY way to play Counter-Strike Global Offensive. Over the last few years, the NA Scene for CS has become stagnant and stale. We are here to provide an alternative to the standard way to play. The GO Arena not only features some intense, competitive gameplay from high end players, but also a huge batch of unknown players that can make themselves known to the masses. 
 
 
* What separates us from other Counter-Strike tournaments is that we are run like a Sports League. What this means in we never cease operation and run yearly. We have 4 seasons a year split between off-seasons where we take new registrations. New sign ups are placed into the rookie draft and scouted during our Scouting Combine Weekend while Veterans (returning players) are place in a bidding war. Teams have a salary cap and a set amount of contract years they can hand out. Whichever team bids the highest earns the player and based on their salary they can be given X amount of years. This is where our RPG kicks in. How you play determines your career. Play well and you could be the hottest commodity in the league and headline all-star weekend. Player poorly and be a bad teammate and you could be released into the Free Agency Pool. Play inconsistently and you could find yourself being traded to another team. Owners in our league have full control of their teams. From trading players to releasing, drafting and bidding owners determine what their team looks like. They set the lines and try to guide their team to victory.
 
 
 
* Don't Miss Your Chance to Join the Revolution
 
Sign-Ups are now open for Beta Season 1! Anyone who wants to get a taste of competitive, high level gameplay should sign-up!

I've even had people on my team trying to get me to set my cmdrate and rates low just so I see people glitch around corners before they run out. I've been playing CS since 1.3 and back in the day, when you had high ping you had a disadvantage, not an advantage. The netcoding in this game caters to players with high ping. I must say I am completely dissatisfied with the quality of competitive matchmaking. Require a more acceptable range of rates for competitive, or force players into casual if their internet connection isn't able to support proper competitive play.

I skipped source because I thought it looked nice but the gameplay was horrid. This game is at least somewhat decent at recreating 1.6 gameplay, with a new-game feel. While I still prefer 1.6, this game is a refreshing change. However with exploits like this, it makes it unbearable to play 1/3rd of the competitive matchmaking games. Simply requiring a reasonable range of rates for competitive match is simple to implicate, and would severely improve competitive matchmaking, without effect casual players. /rant"	t5_2sqho	True

- Addressed some stability issues.
- Fixed perf issues when logging is enabled.

- The smoke grenade smoke is now taller so it's now more useful to use it to block places like double-doors in dust2.
- Players can no longer interrupt another player defusing the bomb by standing in between them and the bomb.
- Disabled sv_pure on listen servers.
- Fixed an sv_pure bug that resulted in false inconsistent MD5s
- Increased search iterations and time delay for keeping sessions in the ignored pool. mm_ignored_sessions_reset can now reset the ignored pool.

where STEAMDIR is the directory to the steamcmd dir ( example: ~/Steam/ )
where STEAMSCRIPT is the name of the script that steamcmd should execute ( example: ~/Steam/csgo.txt )

For information on how to create a script for steamcmd, see https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter- Strike:_Global_Offensive_Dedicated_Servers#Automating_SteamCmd"	t5_2sqho	True

1376272960.0	1k6hfu	Help FaceIT help us.	NiPTV-Anders	64	8	23	"Hello everyone !  

I feel like every other day I discover a new topic I wish I could do something about when it comes to Counter-Strike, and this past week I´ve had the good fortune to have been invited to Italy, for the third time, to cast CS at the FaceIT studio, so here is what I have discovered on my returning trips.  

1) The FaceIT guys are some hard working people.  
2) They are passionate about the game and wish to improve their platform based on feedback from the community.  
3) They actually give back to the community, monthly 1500 dollar tournament IN SPITE of the fact that the community hasn´t been very responsive..  
4) They are the only other studio in Europe, the first being ESL, that will actually host and provide an enviroment for Counter-Strike.  
5) They are very skilled and talented, and they are honest.  
6) They will fly in casters and colour casters(Threat and myself last month)  

Now there is no hiding that FaceIT is a business, they want you guys to come play, so that they can make more money from their sponsors, but then in turn provide more content for the game, and hopefully continue that happy spiral.  

I had a long and rather depressing talk with the owner of the studio last night where he said that he had spent about 1 hour a week for a while now trying to talk to users who had signed up for the CS platform. It isnt even his job to do this, but here is a short story about how we ended up on the subject:  

Me: So I heard you how single handedly resurrected the Quake community?  
Him: Its true, and the way we did it made me feel so good, because we took feedback from the community, and slowly managed to give them the things they wanted. So we slowly converted all the negative people and came out as the heroes, that made me feel so good.  

---- Pause to talk about quake ect... ----  

Him: Actually that is what makes me sad about our involvement with Counter-Strike, I can´t get any feedback. I love the feeling of providing a great product and seeing the feedback change from bad to good over time. But from the CS community it just isn´t there.  


Obviously the above is just how I recall the conversation, it wasnt an interview, but just a late night conversation we had in his kitchen, so dont take it too literally, but I hope the message comes across. I think it was after this that it occured to me that FaceIT could really do a lot for the community. I also just need to add that, in case it sounds like that reading it, this wasnt some kind of whiny speach about the CS community being shit as we hear fairly often, this was the actual frustration of a person who really puts a lot of heart into trying to build something.  

They offer 128 tick servers. They are VERY receptive towards feedback from the community. You can actually use the time you spent to win things from their sponsors.  

I can´t think of many reasons not to play on their platform, so this blog post is actually just plainly my suggestion to everyone, play on FaceIT, give them feedback and I doubt very seriously that you will be dissapointed in the long run.  

Oh also just a quick disclaimer, the only thing I get out of promoting FaceIT at this point, is the chance that I might get invited back to Italy for future casts..

Ya, this is what a nerd does on a 4th of July weekend. :) Let me know what you guys think. I'd be happy to add features if I can.

For anyone wondering why you would want to know the age of an account, the answer is because often cheaters will have new accounts. Maybe because they've been banned on their previous ones, or because they bought a separate account for cheating. So if a player is suspicious and they have a new account, I often report them.

**Update:** Gees, I wish I knew why I got downvotes for this. Must be the cheaters! :)

People trash talk so much, and often against their own team.  Just now I played a game where some guy would say on mic ""you're horrible, quit the game"", every time someone would miss a shot.  I've also been in countless games where both sides are just yelling at each other, talking shit.  No matter if I'm winning or losing, someone on either team will just spout vile words as obnoxiously as they can.  A clan of 5 beat our 5 randoms (and one of us dropped early on), and at the end they just yelled how much we sucked and how we should all quit CS.

I know this is the internet, but things like this really degrades the experience of the game.  Is there anything that can be done?  Does the reporting system do anything?  If you or your friends do it, please stop.  I know it's often just trash talking for the fun of it, but it's really rude and it's horrible sportsmanship."	t5_2sqho	True

I was wondering if this has been happening to anyone else. I've had it happen a few times, but I remember two where I actually took advantage of this event.
The first was on Dust 2, I was on Short A as a CT looking out to long A. And for just a fraction of a second, I see a terrorist appear running in between A and Long A, and moments later, a terrorist with the same model runs in from Long A, which I picked off easily.

The second time was just yesterday on Inferno, I was a CT going from Mid to A, as I turn the corner to Right Middle I see a T going towards the wall as if he had just left Apps. Sure enough, I aim at the door and the terrorist walks right into my crosshair.

I'm obviously not hacking, and these players weren't particularly laggy, so I'd like to know if anyone else has had this happen to them? It's a dirty way to get kills, but I genuinely didn't do anything to exploit this."	t5_2sqho	True

In what is easily going to be the most awesome CS filled night this month has given us, after a little bit of a dry spell we are going to be back in action with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 5 matches that are going to be ""freaking awesome"".

Starting up live at 6pm GMT, we kick off the night with VeryGames vs Absolute legends!  These two teams easily in everyones top 10 teams, this going to be awesome! With AL trying to steal that number 4 spot into the lan, and VG hoping to take first place in the league, this is going to be one hell of a match.

ESC vs Anexis Following this up at 7pm GMT, is going to be an important match for both sides. ESC, everyones number three, are in a tough spot being knocked down to 4th place by Virtus.Pro, and need this win. On the other hand, Anexis need a victory to say in the invite league, and who better to get against then a head as big as ESC's? But that will follow onto:

NIP VS VG! 8pm GMT HELL YEA!!!!!!!!!! The mother of all matches, the undisputed champion against the undisputed second. Will Scream give VG the boost they need, or will get_right and Co beat their rivals once again. You're just going to have to contain your beards and tune in to find out.

Virtus.pro vs ASES: 9pm GMT.

ASES are in trouble and need a win, and virtus pro, coming off of their shocking victory over ESC, aren't going to make it easy. Is this going to be a dominating display by the Virtus pro side, or is ASES going to be able to make the upset of the century?

10pm-12PM??? GMT Of course, while all this awesomeness was happening between VG and NiP was happening, four other top teams were fighting, and I'll be demo casting the following:

AL vs Fnatic. Fnatic started the season badly, but as of late have been on a rebound, putting themselves in with a long shot chance of hitting the finals. But to do so, they have to defeat Absolute legends. 

Fm.Toxic vs Anexis. After a brilliant start to their season, FM.Toxic have fallen out of the realistic chances of hitting that lan final. But now they have to fight for survival in the Invite league, against Anexis, who have only managed to pick up one win so far.

Yes people, this is going to be Legen-wait for it-dary, and you would be a fool to miss out on this sexy counter strike action. And all of it is going to be (Unprofessionally) by me and my British accent, with the support of escene.de and a cup of tea and biscuits. So I'll see you in chat in two hours time!"	t5_2sqho	True

Who is developing the game now? Are they actively making the game better? I ask because I mostly here about how bad the game is (long queue times, bugs, odd mechanics, etc.)

I really like that GO has matchmaking because I mostly enjoy 5v5's and getting one in 1.6/Source was pretty much impossible without ESEA. Is the matchmaking a good replacement for someone who really enjoys competitive 5v5's?

Thanks guys/gals.

To better gauge the skill of individual players, we'd like to require that you have an [efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy) rating on [altPUG](http://altpug.com/). What do you think of this requirement?

-------

Hey there!

Myself and my friend (*Poit*) have full intention of picking up Reddit Cup. Dates to come shortly as we don't want to conflict with ESEA LAN playoffs. We are in the process of creating the application form which should be online soon as well as general tournament rules and information, which will be up by Tuesday night at the latest. Even though this is short, we just wanted to make our intentions known, and let all of you know that we will be taking this over.

We'll be posting updates regularly to this subreddit. Check back for recurring updates, as we plan on posting a few polls and general questions to gauge community reaction. If you have any questions or want to help, you can send me a message or post here and I will get back to you ASAP! We are looking for casters and server administrators across the scheduled three days.

We're also going to kickstart the prize pool with **$200** out of pocket. In the coming week we'll have a web page where you can directly toss money into the prize pool and keep us accountable. We figure having a tournament with no prize is like playing poker without betting real money. No money will be taken off the top, everything is going towards the final prize pool. (*Minus PayPal fees probably...*)

We hope to make this the best Reddit Cup so far, and just want everyone to have fun.

**tl;dr** CS:GO Reddit Cup is back, more soon"	t5_2sqho	True

My partner /u/MrPig and I have been working behind the scenes on our next big update for [altPUG](http://www.altpug.com/) (stay tuned) but just wanted to give credit to Volcano and FMPONE for a *beautiful* reskinning of de_cache! In fact, we love it so much that it's replaced the previous version on all altPUG servers.

If you haven't checked out, I highly recommend you do.  I had the great opportunity to play through the map in last week's Reddit Community Night and, while Volcano certainly dominated on our team, the map is really fun (and pretty) while retaining the playability and layout of the previous version.

Happy fraggin'!

&gt;Hi,
 
&gt;tomorrow we plan to launch the CS:GO Maps Workshop.
 
&gt;1. We’ve started working on the wiki here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO_Workshop_For_Server_Operators

&gt;It would be helpful if people read through it and posted questions and helped us cover the basics by tomorrow.


&gt;2. We’re moving the _SE maps from the depot into the workshop. You can either squirrel them away before they get deleted or use them directly from the workshop, which is what we recommend.

&gt;In order to do that you will need to

&gt;a. Learn how to launch your server with a workshop collection instead of a mapgroup.

&gt;b. Learn how to create collections so you can recreate your mapgroup and get your server up and running asap.

 
&gt;What is a Collection? A collection is essentially a mapgroup ( or mapcycle ) of Workshop maps that is editable and sharable through the Maps Workshop.

1349648169.0	113uqs	Happy 10k subs everyone - time to tell us what YOU want to see in the future of r/GlobalOffensive!	Hands	65	11	29	"Hello r/GlobalOffensive!

With r/GO passing 10,000 subs last week, BrokN9 and I decided it's high time to ask for some feedback and suggestions from you guys regarding the subreddit and its future.  We have discussed some ideas of our own, but for now we want to hear what you all have to say!

1)  What could we do to improve the subreddit?  Throw out any suggestions you might have, or things we aren't doing now that we should be to help promote the community and keep the subreddit as awesome as it has been so far.  Stuff to think about: sidebar organization, user flair, community servers (do we accept them all or just some? should we try to procure our own ""official"" /r/GO servers?), etc.

2)  Should we have any rules restricting certain types of content (i.e. memes, question threads, ""play my server"" posts, etc)?  BrokN9 and I personally don't feel this is needed at the moment but if enough people feel strongly to the contrary we will consider it.

3)  I think most people would agree we could use a nice custom stylesheet / skin for the subreddit.  **Consider this an official announcement that we are accepting submissions for a new skin!**  If you create a great, clean, relatively minimalist and light-background skin for r/GO and we like it we will be happy to put it up.  Ideally we would get several submissions and then put it to a community vote for you guys.

Throw out any ideas or concerns or feedback you have about anything to do with r/GlobalOffensive and we will read them and do our best to adhere to the will of the community.  We're here to run this subreddit for you guys and we want to do whatever necessary to make r/GO the best it could possibly be."	t5_2sqho	True

1. Classic competitive needs to be playing SE maps. It's the maps any league/tournament will be using, and those leagues and tournaments are the life blood to CS.

2. Sounds - Vague so I will elaborate. An enemy CANT hear you cock a weapon but they CAN hear you slightly move a scope to your face halfway across the map? This is broken; scoping should be silent and quick switching/pulling out a gun should be audible.

That's all really, things like a silencer for the m4/p2000 don't effect gameplay so get to those things when you can. Those two things I listed are effecting game quality.

We launched our service on Saturday in the middle of the Reddit tournament (shout out to Kubz for organizing that AWESOME event) with the promise of promoting transparency, so I'd like to take the time to share what we've been doing for the past couple of days -- we've been very busy!  I can't speak for /u/MrPig but I think I'm up to a whopping total of 24 hours of sleep since Saturday; launching has been so exciting and we just want to make the service as best as it can be to the point that I've been up until at least 3AM every night (and awake for 9-5 work four hours later).

Probably the most drastic change so far is to address a major problem we've seen: people come to the site, log in through Steam, create an account, and then never play a game.  We implemented some tracking to see how many people download the client (about 60% of the 565 registered users) and how many have logged into the client (less than that).  To help address this, we launched a [Getting Started guide](http://i.imgur.com/uHtxXNZ.png). You should only see this once when you log in or create an account; to get back to it, click ""Support"" and select ""Getting Started"".

*We still need your feedback!* We're quickly squashing bugs as soon as we can and the list is dwindling, which means that soon we'll be able to focus on enhancing the site and adding new functionality.  Please, PLEASE, tell us:

1. What do you like about the service?
2. What would you change if you could?
3. How can we make altPUG more awesome?

If you haven't signed up, please check it out and let us know what you think. We hope to have some big news in the near future, but for now, enjoy the change log from the past 4 days: 

**Website:**

* ADD: Advanced formatting added to the forums
* ADD: Added a new registration workflow to make it easier to get started with altPUG
* ADD: Added the ability for users to find Steam Friends already on altPUG
* ADD: Added a buddy list to the portal
* ADD: In player lists, added ties to the player's historical match history
* ADD: Leaderboard now highlights the currently logged in user
* CHG: Updated the look of tooltips and added tooltip support to the in-game browser
* CHG: Removed the Oregon west coast server location as it was redundant
* FIX: User display names now must be unique
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the player would be incorrectly credited for a win/loss based only on the player's performance, regardless of whether their team's win/loss outcome as a whole
* FIX: Fixed an issue with the central server where the system clock would fall out of sync
* FIX: Fixed an issue where using some characters in forum posts caused a 500 error

**Server Add-on:**

* ADD: Server logs are now uploaded automatically when the server crashes
* ADD: Added a ready* up kick timer to halftime
* ADD: Added a ready* up kick timer to players already connected when the match ends
* ADD: Added a new version of the .players command while the match is live (splitting the players by team)
* ADD: Added support for demo uploading and processing
* ADD: Turned all talk on during warm-up and half time
* CHG: The host name of the game server now reflects the name on the website
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the server would not switch maps after a map vote if Valve returns an HTTP error from the workshop
* FIX: Fixed a bug where the server would crash if a player was still connecting when a round ended
* FIX: Fixed an issue where the server could crash on map change
* FIX: Improved server performance while demos were uploading to the CDN

**Client:**

* ADD: Added a ""Play Now"" button that launches the server browser
* FIX: Fixed Windows 8 compatibility issues with login process
* FIX: Lowered the rate at which the client verifies the user's login token
* FIX: Fixed an issue where the client could not login using Firefox or Opera
* FIX: Fixed an issue where applying a client update would not gracefully close the currently executing client application
* FIX: Fixed an issue where applying a client update would fail if SteamService had an open file handle on the client

Happy fraggin'!

Counter Strike has been the competitive FPS eSport that is played globally for nearly if not over a decade. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is the newest installment as we are all aware and is very different from the previous titles, however we all love and hate it for our own reasons.

DOTA is the popular Warcraft 3 mod that everyone should be familiar with due to the recent success of the proper games made that are modeled after it. DOTA and DOTA2 are incredibly similar to each other, however DOTA2 has minor improvements that make the game work better on a mechanical level due to no longer being restricted by the Warcraft 3 engine. Prior to DOTA2, Valve had nothing to do with this game at all.

There are two major points that I would like to make from this information.

1) The International is a yearly DOTA2 mega-tournament held by Valve themselves, and the prize pot has only grown. Has Valve ever hosted a Counter Strike tournament? 

2) DOTA and DOTA2 play very similarly. Movement, hero mechanics, map layout, etc. are all the same. The only differences are improved visuals, interface, and some buggy interactions fixed. Why, then, is every version of Counter Strike so fundamentally different from each other? Why is it when we complain about design flaws in CS:GO we are told they are intended and to adapt? How can these two conflicting mindsets exist under the same roof?

----

Of course the obvious answer to the question of why DOTA2 gets so much more attention than CS is money, but Valve could have at least tried to revive CS and make their own footprint in eSports rather than following a trend in the market.

1373768322.0	1i93yt	Over 1 million CS:GO monthly players	LashLash	64	11	5	"I don't know if everyone noticed this, but in the reply email to m0rdock's movement changes from Matt Wood, A Valve developer ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1i0c0b/new_movement_values_test_server_up/cazxml2)), this line was in there:

""... but are 18 points in the top comment of a Reddit post enough to represent **over a million CSGO monthly players**?""

So you might be wondering how this make sense with ~30k peak concurrent players according to steam: http://www.steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;appid=730

First I will define a player day. A player day is the number of days of a game was played by all players. If there was only 1 player in a game, and he played ALL day, that is 1 player day. If 10 players play half a day each, that's 5 player days of game time. To figure out player days, you find the area under a concurrent user graph, where the horizontal axis is in units of days, and the vertical axis is units of concurrent players.

Back to what this has to do with anything. According to the steam graph, the amount of player days in the last week was about 140,000 (~20,000 average * 7 days, you want the area under the graph for player days). 

So over the past month, the approximate player day are 600,000. Now, if there over million CS:GO monthly players, then the average CS:GO player played a bit less than 600,000/1,000,000 days, or slightly less than **14.4 hours in the last month for the average player (CS:GO)**.

Compare this to DotA 2. ~3.9 million monthly players ([Source](http://blog.dota2.com/)) while the peak is above 300k concurrent. Approximately 1,680,000 player days in the last week ([Graph](http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;appid=570) ~240,000 x 7 days, again you want to estimate the area under the graph). So approximately 7,200,000 player days in the last month. The average DotA 2 player in the past month played about 7,200,000/3,900,000 days or **44 hours on average in the last month for the average player (DotA 2)**.

DotA 2 is a more played game by it's populace based on hours, not too surprising? Since a lot of CS:GO players are very casual, since it's pretty casual friendly. You can hop onto a community server or the non-matchmaking modes and hop-off without issue, while DotA 2 requires you to commit if you play. The majority of CS:GO players (and CS players in general) don't play 5v5 pugs.

1370799597.0	1fzoaf	"""Need weapon!"" and ""I drop!"" should be radio commands."	Killerkanickel	69	21	44	"I feel like a lot of players in CS:GO matchmaking are not very familiar with dropping weapons for their teammates and the proper way to express their need for a weapon. It happens way too often, even in the higher skill brackets, that one player in the team has to play without a weapon, because the two guys with 10000$ didn't drop one.

It also happens a lot that one player needs a weapon and just writes ""drop"" in team say which is rather confusing, because usually it works this way: 

If you need a weapon, write ""need weapon"" (short: nw) in team say.

If you are able to drop a weapon for that player, write ""drop"" (short: d) in team say.

If two or more players write ""drop"", the first one drops a weapon to avoid dropping multiple weapons.

As most of the ingame radio commands are rather useless, I thought it would be a good idea to put them into better use and make ""Need weapon!"" and ""I drop!"" radio commands to simplify the process and maybe make it work better in lesser coordinated skill brackets.

The concept should also be explained upon introduction to let the players know about it.

PS: I do know that some players don't drop a weapon, because they just don't want to or they feel like it would be a waste (which can of course be true in certain cases), but you can't change that.

There's two things I wanted to share with you, which I've been working on lately.  
As so many others, I was bothered by the difference in gap size between the different weapons, and I decided to work our completely how this gap comes into being and what values you need to counter it.  
The result is [this little generator](http://csgo.eu01.aws.af.cm/static/), which blurts out a whole bunch of aliases that you can bind to your weapon slots to reduce the annoyance of different gap sizes.  
It's really nothing special, and I'm sure a lot of people can figure out the values on their own by trial-and-error, but I just thought it'd be nice to have this around for everyone who can't be bothered doing all that.  
I've also written a page [explaining the more intricate and unknown workings of the crosshair cvars](http://csgo.eu01.aws.af.cm/cvars/crosshair/), as far as I have been able to figure them out. (Damned cl_crosshairalpha)

I intend to do similar things in the future, but I'm not much of a fast worker and I'm also overly precise so it might take a while.  
Next on the list, though, are sensitivity and other mouse cvars.

Hopefully this will be of some use to some of you.

Currently, here is what happens : [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVF_dAiV0s) from [Kami19o4](http://kami19o4.de)

Breaking windows with a gun before will just make most of the grenades useless and give too much information at CTs.

Is it possible to revert the fix only on that point ? **5/10 : Done**"	t5_2sqho	True

1363139838.0	1a6t1n	If CS:GO Free to Play means without access to Match Making unless purchase, would you support this move?	chesshaha	63	14	63	"Since there's so much talk about CS:GO goes F2P, I want to point out this possibility. 

What if CS:GO is free to play for all game mode except ""Match Making"", if a new player wants to play MM, they have to actually buy the game.

I think this is the only way make sense if CS:GO goes free to play. If everyone has access to match making, it will make MM cooldown pretty much obsolete.  

I think if Valve wants to make CS:GO this structure, it won't hurt CS:GO at all. It will bring more players and fans to this game, plus maybe even sale more copies of CS:GO.

Thoughts?

Edilt: Made a poll about issuse, i'll update with the result later.

Say Cup 1 is nuke, 2 is inferno, 3 is dust2, etc. This would basically leave the winner as the ""king"" of a specific map. It would also allow for viewers who follow one event to watch the strategies of each team evolve over an event. Imagine how crazy it would be to see each team's strategies evolve based on what team they are playing. Just an idea that popped into my head. Obviously there are some negatives, like the fact that it will be more boring to play the same map over and over, but this could really lead to more map evolution and could be a different way to look at tournaments in CS. What do you guys think?"	t5_2sqho	True
