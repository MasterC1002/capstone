On their top banner, they have the release date of every hiphop album coming out that month. Not sure how difficult it would be to keep/update, but it would be nice to see who's releasing a new album and when it's supposed to come out, because personally I'm horrible at remembering that kind of stuff.	t5_2sayb	True

So I've been browsing for the past few days, and I have to say, it's really fucking shameful how many posts I've seen from people excited to share their band's music, or their first demo, what have you - all absolutely downvoted to shit. Albeit, a couple of them have been reposts, but the rest were perfectly good posts by people sharing what they do.

As someone who has been playing in bands for the past six years, I know how easy it is to be discouraged when someone doesn't like what you do. I know, ""it's just karma - it's not worth anything."" But how would you feel if you worked hard on something, were excited to share it, and then found that not only did people not care, but they TOLD you that they didn't like it without any kind of advice? Spare me the ""people should just have thick skin here"" shit - it feels bad.

Point is, this scene likes to pride itself on its support of small bands, venues, and businesses. How are we supposed to keep that up if we clearly only support the names everyone already knows? Take a listen to these small bands - you might end up liking them. And if you don't like it, just move on, or help them out with advice. People shouldn't have to be reminded of rediquette (better known as being a decent person). Reserve downvotes for things that obviously don't belong. You never know - the next big band could be posted on this sub without you even knowing.

Sorry to write a novel like I always do, but this isn't even about my own music. It just pisses me off knowing that if I was at a show with everyone on this sub, that many people would be standing outside until the headliner. Help people out instead of figuratively telling them to fuck off.

**TLDR - Stop downvoting small bands unless you have a good reason. ""I don't like it"" isn't a good reason. If your reason is ""I don't care, I just want to hear bands I know,"" get off of here and go listen to Spotify or something.**"	t5_2sayb	True

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is a link to it.

Hopeless just made the entire album streamable on YouTube. 

You can now stream The Wonder Years new album ""The Greatest Generation"" in its ENTIRETY here:http://smarturl.it/thegreateststream

""It's 2013 and no one that wasn't supposed to have our record got it until we mailed them out. It's shocking and really a nice feeling that a bond of mutual respect with everyone who had the press stream kept the album where it belonged. 

Now, the record is streaming so you can listen guilt free. Like I said, its 2013. I know how shit works. Music is free if you want it to be, so why pay for it? To that, I say, touché. I get it. I understand but I'd like to counter with this: it's $10. 

Crime in Stereo said this to me once and it really struck me. Just stop and think about what you'd spend $10 on; one trip to chipotle? Going to a movie if it's a cheap one? Maybe a t-shirt from like Urban Outfitters if its on sale? Two beers at a bar?

We put in months of our lives into this record. We sweat and we froze in a shitty practice space. We argued and fought tooth and nail over every song. We spent weeks of 15 hour days at the studio working until we physically couldn't anymore literally getting frustrated to the point of punching walls because we didn't get it perfect. And that doesn't even begin to account for financial shit. But forget all that. What's most important is that we feel all the way down to our bones that this is our best record to date and the critics seem to agree. 

It's not intended as a guilt trip or like I'm pleading with you. It's just a suggestion: next time you're about to go to chipotle, maybe eat what your mom made or use your college meal card or make something yourself. The next time you're gonna go to the bar, split a 30 pack with some buddies and drink at home. I'm suggesting you take that $10 and buy The Greatest Generation because we think its worth it and it matters to us as a band that you do. That's all. Hope your lives are great. See you this summer.""- Dan ""Soupy"" Campbell"	t5_2sayb	True

DISCLAIMER: I know my list is pretty short and missing a lot of good pop punk.  If you want something added make a comment saying ""ADD: Artist- Album"" and if  you want something removed ""REMOVE: Artist- Album"".  If there is a decent response for any, the appropriate action will be taken. 
DISCLAIMER 2: Because many people are strict with their genres, and some aren't, it's difficult to determine what truly is pop punk and what isn't.  With that in mind, don't hate on someone for thinking The Get Up Kids aren't or are pop punk.  Let the upvotes and downvotes decide what stays on the list!

And due to this, I understand that I'm going to see posts from incredibly popular bands, such as TWY, Story So Far, Handguns, etc upvoted incredibly high, even if it is a repost, mainly because the majority of the subreddit loves them.  

However, what I've come to see is that this subreddit really does not like discussion.  The only time I see a large amount of comments is on one of the said popular band videos, and those comments always go along the lines of ""I saw these guys live in wherever with whoever and they were so fucking awesome"" Or ""hardest working band today""

And that's cool too, I think it's good to feel strongly about a band.  Besides, a lot of these bands wouldn't be around without fan support.   But when it comes to smaller, lesser known bands, or someone saying, ""hey listen to this recording my friend made""  those posts rarely get votes, and almost nobody ever comments.  

The same goes for discussion post like this.

Consider this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/vwhx0/top_10_pop_punk_songs/

right now it is at 5 votes up and 2 votes down.  I know Reddit fuzzes ups and downs, but I really believe they would fuzz for a post from 2 hours ago with a total of 7 votes.  So this means that two people downvoted a legitimate question related to pop punk.  

And then there's this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/vr0qb/can_localunknown_poppunks_show_off_their_music_on/

which did get a few encouraging responses

and then I see things like this which is, in my opinion, what the OP of the last post was trying to do: http://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/vvcrj/original_acoustic_song_my_friends/

with 4 upvotes, 2 down and 0 comments.  No discussion about the music, nothing.

also this, http://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/comments/vvhc3/would_appreciate_it_if_you_guys_check_out_this/

2 upvotes, 0 downvotes, 0 comments


Look, I don't want to sound like I'm judging this subreddit.  For all I know, a ton of people actually may listen to the bands.

I'm just also subscribed to /r/hiphopheads and the quality of posts and comments there are just on another level.  I'd love to see /r/poppunkers become something like that despite them having 10x as many subscribers.

The music I make is mostly comedic and a parody of pop punk music. I haven't released an actual album in any format in about 7 years. However I recently had a concept album idea of recording the most generic sounded pop punk album possible. I need your help. Below is the song titles I've come up with so far. I'm opening to more song title ideas and even themes.


1. Intro
2. Hit Single
3. (This song doesn’t need) Parentheses
4. John Hughes Movie Title
5. Shameless Green Day Rip Off
6. Obscure Movie Quote
7. ths sng hs n vwls
8. Quote from one of Chuck Palahniuk’s books
9. Song Title Split
10. Between Two Songs
11. True Life Story
12. Poorly Hidden Track

We should have a vote each week on what albums you guys recently listened to/albums that you love beyond all measures/ albums you don't understand why they got such a bad rap/any album.

Don't get me wrong I love a good pop punk song with rough or emo lyrics but I miss the fun songs too like ""Honestly"" by Cartel or ""The Party Song"" by Blink 182. I would just like to see this newer generation of pop punkers write some more positive songs. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place but it just harder to find these days.

1373579386.0	1i40b2	So Soupy might have caused some controversy at Warped yesterday in Maryland...	bachzenson	48	8	93	"Here's how it all went down.

First of all, the two main stages were both inside the amphitheater at Merriweather Post in Maryland. Memphis May Fire went on the stage right side of the mainstage, followed immediately by The Wonder Years on stage left.

Introducing a song, the lead singer of Memphis May Fire (Matty Mullins, an overhyped screamer who credits himself for being a devote Christian) said that he doesn't like what most girls at Warped were wearing, and that women shouldn't be dressing up like sluts to get backstage or get guys to like them. Me and all my friends who were there to see TWY all looked at each other like ""Damn, he just called about 95% of the girls here sluts.""

After they finished, The Wonder Years came on (sidenote: they kicked so much ass). Soupy introduced the second song of the set by saying that women should never be called sluts or bitches, and that if anyone ever calls you a slut or a bitch, whether its your best friend or the singer of a band, they don't deserve respect. Everyone cheered for an extremely long time.

The fight took to Twitter when the guitarist of MMF said [this](https://twitter.com/Ant_Sepe/status/355116835865231362), and Soupy responded (with a bit more class) with [this](https://twitter.com/headabovewater/status/355350859535757312). I'm totally on Soupy's side for this, and the dudes from MMF are all huge douchebags.

**TL;DR**: Memphis May Fire called the girls at Warped Tour sluts, Soupy said that women should never be called sluts, subtweeting ensued. "	t5_2sayb	True

The van is completely totaled. As is the case with most full time touring bands they have no health insurance and are accepting donations to help with the hospital bills and to put towards a new van. EVERYTHING COUNTS. Keep these dudes in your thoughts, they are great guys and no band deserves this. To donate, paypal your donation to

here is a link to their facebook to check them out if you haven't. http://www.facebook.com/MAKERMA?fref=ts
