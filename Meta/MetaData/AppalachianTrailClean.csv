In the weeks of research before that, I spent a lot of time browsing the Whiteblaze forums and this subreddit, being a redditor. You might remember these topics I've created:

[Help a Dutch guy out: Deciding on a route](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/19mvwr/help_a_dutch_guy_out_deciding_on_a_route/)

[The first thing you got rid of once you started the trail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/1awzcx/the_first_thing_you_got_rid_of_once_you_started/)

The whole experience was fantastic and went way beyond my expectations. As my flair indicates, the plan was to walk to Damascus but that was a bit too optimistic. I decided to stop in Erwin instead, a decision I don't regret at all. A week more and I would have been able to make it.

During the trip, two major problems appeared: a blocked creditcard which forced me to take a few zero days in Hiawassee, and a pair of feet with serious blisters caused by wearing the wrong shoes. The first problem was solved by calling my bank and activating my Maestro/Cirrus card, which was set to 'Europe' instead of 'Worldwide'. I thought I had solved the problem by buying new shoes at the Three Eagles Outfitter, but in fact, those shoes only made it worse. Thinking it was just the 'brake in phase', I walked the next days all the way to Franklin only to return them in their other Three Eagles Outfitter store. Once they saw my ruined feet, they made sure to replace them with some awesome Merrell Barefeet shoes (vibram soles) which made my blisters go away in the next few days.

I've met over 50 people on the trail, all with the same kind of love for nature and hiking. I felt completely at home, meeting new people everyday. The southern hospitality along the trail was something that surprised me as well, with people giving me food and drinks on numerous accounts of trail magic (9 bags of Mountain House dinners in one case in Fontana) and the rides people were offering me to the nearby towns. I learned what I was capable of, and walked a total of 332 miles which is a nice average of about 10 miles a day (including the forced zero days). It was also nice to spend some time in Atlanta as well, I got there by Greyhound. (Erwin &gt; Johnson City &gt; Knoxville &gt; Atlanta).

Once again, thanks for the help I've received over here that made me more prepared. I'll continue to help others out as well!"	t5_2stbz	True

So I started hiking the 10 miles back to the trailhead at Fontana dam, and a few miles away felt so weak and in pain that I just ditched my pack and all my equipment because I was genuinely afraid I wasn't going to make it out of there alive.

I finally got to the trailhead, got a ride to Fontana village, and from there am ambulance to Bryson City Hospital, where they diagnosed kidney stones, and then I peed them out 10 minutes before I was to be discharged. (My only luck yesterday)

So now I'm in a motel room recuperating, my pack sitting in the woods, and a couple of stones still need to come out. The ranger station is going to try and send a ridgerunner to grab my pack today, so I hope it's still there.

Ah.

It's just how one sexy dude hiked the AT.  Feel free to ask about whatever else, and other thru-hikers feel free to contribute.  This is Part I because it was too long.  Part II is continued in the comments.*


* **AN ABRIDGED HISTORY**

The Appalachian Trail is a 2,181 mile continuous scenic trail that spans from Springer Mountain in northern Georgia all the way up to Mt. Katahdin in Maine's Baxter State Park. It was started in the 1920s by a guy named Benton MacKaye, and finished in the early 30s by Myron Avery, who became the first man to hike the entire thing, though not in one season. That was first done in 1948 by a WW2 vet and total badass named Earl Shaffer. He was a baller.  Nobody believed him when he claimed that he had done the entire thing at once, because that's fucking crazy. But he did, and he set the tradition of going northbound from Georgia to Maine, the reverse of the Trail's official route. Since then some other notable folks have hiked it and some other stuff has happened and you can read about all of it on Wikipedia.


* **GEOGRAPHY**

The AT passes through, going north, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The respective states, for the most part, have a pretty distinct feel to them and vary largely in difficulty. For instance, I hiked nearly all of Maryland in one day because Maryland is really goddamned easy, whereas in southern Maine I'd do 12 mile days and be exhausted because Maine just wants to kill you.

The southern terminus of the Trail is on little Springer Mountain, while the northern terminus is on kickass Mt. Katahdin.  90% of people who attempt to thru-hike (hiking the trial end to end in less than a year) begin in Georgia in Spring and go north. These sexy people are called northbounders, or NOBOs. The other 10% are weirdos we like to call SOBOs, or dirty sou-bounders.

The trail is pretty rough from Georgia all the way through Tennessee, with a whole lot of up and down (not nearly as much as, say, New Hampshire, but still not the easiest part by far). And if you start in March, like it did, it's still really goddamned cold in the southern mountains. I had a 15 degree bag and I was still really cold some nights in the Smokies. It started warming up in Tennessee, but I didn't send my cold weather gear home until southern Virginia.

Everything becomes instantly better in Virginia, when you come down from the hill-people-infested, privyless mountains of Tennessee and into the wonderful town of Damascus, VA, home to the annual hikerpalooza festival, Trail Days. Southern and central Virginia is full of great towns and great trail, and the climbs start being concentrated into big two- or three-thousand footers followed by miles of flat ridge-walking. Once you hit the Shenandoahs, it all gets really, really flat pretty much until the end of Massachusetts.

The only thing really notable, geographically, until then is the state of Pennsylvania. It gets a lot of hate but I didn't mind it all that much, because it is really flat. The reason it gets so much hate are the rocks. So many rocks. And poison ivy. There are miles of Pennsylvania that are just a big game of The Floor Is Lava where you have to hop across rocks or else walk through poison ivy. That's half of Pennsylvania, and the other half is farm valleys, which are really nice and flat and really pretty although sometimes they smell like shit.

Once you hit Vermont, you're back in the mountains. Vermont is hilly and really, really muddy, but full of super nice people and it's really easy to get a hitch. After you leave Vermont and head into New Hampshire, you hit the Whites. A lot of people say this is the hardest part of the trail, but I disagree. The Whites are tough, definitely, and are run by the Appalachian Mountain Club, a private organization that doesn't give one single fuck about thru-hikers, but they're really amazing to hike through. You're climbing some big, big mountains (including Mt. Washington, where we summitted in 90 mph wind), but you're above the tree line so much that it makes for some really astounding views.

Then you get into Maine, which is the most beautiful state on the trail but the one that also most wants to kill you. Southern Maine is really, really hard. It wants you to die. But once you get through there and into Monson and the 100 Mile Wilderness, it's smooth sailing all the way to Katahdin, the only mountain on the trail that's not part of a range, and the biggest sustained climb of the entire journey.


* **PREPARATION**

""Oh shit,"" you say, ""I don't have any hiking experience! There's no way I can do this!""

But that's bullshit. I'd never hiked further than 60 miles in one trip before starting this trail. It helps to physically prepare yourself by running and working out your core, shoulders, and legs, but the only thing that can prepare you for long-distance hiking is long-distance hiking. Despite what some more elitist hikers say, you can hike yourself into shape. The AT is, by far, less of a physical challenge than a mental one.

That said, it is physically challenging and you should be alright with that. The best piece of advice I ever got from a former thru-hiker at the beginning of my hike was this: *You are going to be in pain every single day.* The location of the pain is going to change, but you will hurt every day. And that's true, but if you can come to terms with that and just keep going, then that's one major mental challenge overcome.

I didn't do too much planning, leaving about a month after I decided to quit my job and do it, but a lot of people schedule out their entire trip, shelter to shelter. I think that's pretty silly, but I knew some people who actually did stick to it completely. If that's the sort of thing you're into, go for it. But flexibility, I think, is a major virtue on the trail. I only had short-term schedules, drawn from data in my guidebook, which had mileages and shelter locations. I used the ATC's Thru-Hiker's Companion, but I recommend AWOL's AT Guide.

As for your budget, if you already have gear plan on about $3,000. It's possible to do it on as little as $1,500, but you'll be living a very Spartan life. You will really want beers when you hit towns, I promise.

The most important part of preparation is knowing a whole lot about... CONTINUE TO PART II."	t5_2stbz	True

A couple months back, I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/13zrow/a_new_kind_of_trail_guide/) about a project that I was working on (www.wikitrail.org).  The idea of the project is to put AT trail data online in a format that is accessible to everyone - and can be easily updated whenever the trail changes.

I had to let the project sit for a while (b/c I was on the road, without the time or internet connection needed to do any more work), but over the last few weeks, I've had a chance to add a bunch of stuff that I hope will make the site more useful:

* I've added a ton of new data, and it's all been converted from the 2011 numbers to 2013.  Before, it was just shelters, POs, towns and most of the hostels.  Now, it's got almost all of the important stuff.  I'm sure there are a bunch of things I missed.  If so, these can easily be added.  It's got everything I think you would need to hike the trail.  I'd test it myself, but that'll have to wait until next time!
* I've added trail maps to the PDF guides.  I wanted to get this in when I first posted the site, but I was having some issues with the google maps API.  That's fixed now.  So, now you can see how the trail looks without needing an internet connection.  Take a look at the guide for the [Neels Gap to Hiawassee section](http://www.wikitrail.org/sections/pdf/at/3002?size=mobile).  (There are PDF guides for each of the ""sections"" of the trail as well as a PDF for the whole trail - found on the [AT page](http://www.wikitrail.org/trails/view/at/appalachian-trail).) 
* I've added some stats to the site.  Using the elevation profile data, I calculated the elevation gain/loss along the trail, which also gives you the trail grade as well.  So, now, at a glace you can get a rough idea of the difficulty of each section of the trail (and, yes, I know, there's more to trail difficulty than just the grade).
* I've also built a pretty basic 'planner' to help estimate how long your hike will take and when you'll be at various places along the trail.  I got the idea from http://www.pctplanner.com/, which someone mentioned when I posted about this last time, but I've tweaked it quite a bit.  [Give it a shot](http://www.wikitrail.org/planner/new/at).

I think this can be a really useful tool for people preparing for the trail as well as people already in the middle of a hike.  Pretty much anything on the trail can be reviewed by users - water sources, shelters, hostels, towns, sections of the trail.  Water source dry?  Say so, and future hikers will know not to rely on that water source.  Great experience at a trail hostel?  Leave a review, and let your fellow hikers know.

I've put A LOT of time into this project - WAY more than I was planning on.  Once I got started, though, I had to see it all the way through.  I've enjoyed building it and I've learned a bunch of stuff along the way, but I'd hate it if all of this work were to go to waste.  Please, take a look at what I've built. Tell me what you think (as long as it's constructive, thank you).  If you like it, tell your AT friends.  And, if you're leaving for the trail soon, consider taking the PDF guides on your phone/kindle - can't hurt to have a backup guide!

Thanks for looking!

The only advice I would give is:

1) Carry a light pack. If don't think you need something, you don't.  But it is easy to send stuff home.  In the beginning many hikers carry too much food. I did this myself.  I started with more than 5 days of food! Don't do that!

2) Take it slow, at first.  Lots of people drop out early on because they pushed too hard.  Don't worry about the miles early on.  Just take it easy and let yourself fall into the rhythm.

This could be (and probably is) easily abused so I strongly discourage doing this unless you have a legitimate gear failure, but if you're a thruhiker and have a gear failure, whether its your pack, tent, sleeping bag, trekking poles, boots, or whatever, call up the manufacturer, make sure to mention that you're an AT THRUHIKER, currently in (city, state) and that your stuff broke.

The last thing any of the big names in the outdoor gear industry wants is a thruhiker out there with broken gear, talking about how the products suck.  They will either ask you where you want your free replacement product shipped (and they will ship General Delivery to a PO) or they will tell you where the next authorized retailer is located near the trail so that you can take it there and have it exchanged.  (They typically always want the bad product returned.)

I did this when my Granite Gear pack started tearing in PA.  Another friend had his boots replaced by Merrell because of delamination on the toes, and I saw countless Leki poles repaired and replaced.  So keep a list of the 800 numbers to all your gear manufacturers in your guidebook just in case.  Call them up and explain your situation, be friendly and honest about the situation, and you'll get a brand new one.  I have yet to see any thruhiker turned down doing this."	t5_2stbz	True

My questions for you are:

1. Why did you not complete your thru-hike?

2. If this was something preventable, what would you do differently to prepare? Would you change your behavior at all?

3. After having to end your hike, did you ever finish another year? Did you start over from the beginning?

This is a no judgement zone. I'm not looking to criticize. I just want information. I'm expecting to hear everything from ""I wasn't prepared"" to ""I accidentally broke my leg"". I just want to know the reasons why people fail."	t5_2stbz	True

I'm interested in seeing how my list stacks up to other thru-hikers, this post can also give the 2012'ers some highlights of each state section!

Put yours in order from 1 (favorite) to 13 (least favorite) with some highlights of each state. For the sake of argument, lets have NC/TN combined as one since most of the trail is on the border there anyway.


Wobegon's List:

1. **Maine.** 
    A fantastic and eerie finale to my thru-hike. Southern Maine (especially the section between Stratton and Rangeley) I believe is the toughest section of the whole Trail, but is extremely beautiful. Highlights for me were: Katahdin (of course), The Hundred Mile Wilderness, blueberries, moose, awesome swimming, pancakes at Pierce Pond, the White Wolf Burger in Stratton (don't attempt the challenge)

2. **New Hampshire.**
For the northbounder, Mt. Moosilauke marks our first taste of the alpine zone, and wasn't it AMAZING!?! My fiance and I also spotted our first moose of the trip in the meadow just before the mountain. The Whites are difficult but a highlight of anyone's trip. Highlights: Mt. Washington, Mt. Moosilauke, Hanover

3. **Virginia**
    Try to avoid the ""blues"" and Virginia is a lovely state. On my NOBO hike, I first hit a ""wall"" so to speak physically, but then as I continued to monitor my calorie intake better, I flourished as a hiker. So much to see, considering nearly 1/4th of the trail is in this state. Highlights: gorging myself in Shenandoah Nat'l Park, ponies at the Grayson Highlands, The Priest, Ming's Buffet in Waynesboro

4. **Vermont**
    After I got out of the very muddy section just across the border, I really liked Vermont. Highlights: Green Mountain House Hostel, Mt. Killington, the Long Trail Inn.

5.  **Georgia**
Great southern hospitality, I wish to hike this section again not in the winter of March! Highlights: Blueberry Patch Hostel, Blood Mountain

6. **North Carolina/Tennessee**
    I was still learning at this point, (weren't we all, nobos?) but my trip through the Smokies was overall enjoyable. Highlights: Kincora Hostel, Charlies Bunion and the rest of the Smokies, Watuaga Dam, Standing Indian Mountain.

7. **Massachusetts**
    Northbounders are eager to finally have reached NEW ENGLAND! It was quite muddy when I was there, but I enjoyed Mass. Highlights: Tom Levardi, Mt. Greylock.

8. **West Virginia**
    Sure, you're not in WV for very long, but Harper's Ferry is one of the most historic spots in the East and the ATC is a great ""psychological midpoint"" of the trek. Also an easy train trip into Washington DC.

9.  **New York**
    The deli-to-deli hike was in full swing by the time we were all in the Empire State. AMAZING. Highlights: Bear Mountain, huge sandwiches, train station into Manhattan.

10.  **Maryland**
    Awesome Civil War history and easy trail. Another highlight is fantastic shelters.

11.  **New Jersey**
    Brink Road Shelter I believe has the absolute worst mosquitoes of anywhere in the country I have ever been, and I've been to the Boundary Waters in Northern Minnesota a few times. I also hated that 2 square mile swamp section considering it was over 100 degrees. Yikes. Highlights: lots of bears, High Point State Park, church hostel in Vernon, Sunfish Pond.

12. **Pennsylvania**
    Oh, PA. How (nearly) everyone hated you. The place where boots go to die. Ankle-breaking fields of rocks as far as you can see. Climb up on a ridge, trip over rocks for miles, go down the ridge to a road, repeat. I believe the local section hikers there are masochists. Some highlights though: The Doyle, half-gallon challenge, lovely shelters (when there is water, which in summer can be rare).

13. **Connecticut**
    Where hiker trash meets yuppie richies! The two major trail towns, Salisbury and Kent clearly (from my own perspective of course) want nothing to do with us. Enjoy being yelled at by the lady at the Kent Laundromat and the particularly strange looks at the supermarket. Highlights: Lion's Head.

1375935496.0	1jxoep	If you're hiking with your dog, please put him/her on a leash	hlynn117	36	10	29	"Large portions of the AT are dog-friendly, and dogs make great hiking partners. But always make sure your furry friend is on a leash. I had an incident on the CT section of the AT a week ago involving someone's off-leash dog. I was solo section hiking, and this large, athletic dog came bounding through the woods towards me. I'm not a big person, and I couldn't outrun the dog, so I turned myself so it jumped on my backpack and not at my face. There were several moments where I was unsure whether the dog was just being an enthusiastic dog or if it was attacking me. No one goes hiking thinking, 'Gee, I hope this hike includes fighting off an animal.'

Good news: the dog turned out to be friendly, calmed down, and was able to hike with me for a couple hours. She was able to be returned to the owner via calling the cell number on the dog's collar.

Bad news: I was not the first hiker this dog harassed. There were at least three other hikers I encountered who saw this dog and had similar experiences with it. These experiences were NOT positive, even if these people loved dogs -- and despite the dog ultimately being friendly. The one woman was hiking with her dog, and she had the biggest problem with encountering this energetic dog because it really upset her own (leashed) dog. The owner, btw, turned out to be day hiking some thirty miles behind where the dog was found.

td;lr Please keep your dog on a leash! Even if your dog is normally well-behaved, you're outdoors, and dogs become excited in unfamiliar surroundings -- they CAN run away. Other hikers do not want to take care of your dog if it gets lost."	t5_2stbz	True

""We were somewhere around Hiawassee, on the edge of the Trail, when the Moonshine began to take hold.

We had two bags of trail mix, seventy-five ounces of peanut butter of mescaline, five snickers bars, a saltshaker half-full of spike, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored snack cakes, twinkies, pies, candies... Also, a quart of ice cream, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a large pizza, and two cliff bars. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious food bag, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the pizza. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a thru-hiker in the depths of a pizza binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.

After my thru-hike in '99 I couldn't hardly stand to sit at a job, so I quit and paddled the Mississippi in 2001 from Minneapolis to New Orleans.  There were at least a couple of dozen other people ""thru-paddling"" and most of them were former thru-hikers.

It was quite a bit less social, as there were a lot fewer people doing it, but trail magic has absolutely nothing on river magic.  Random strangers on the river would just give us stuff, all the time.  Wave us over to the bank and let us sleep in their houses.  Pull up on a Chris-Craft and drop off a 12-pack.  It was crazy.

Everybody had these ideas in their heads about how dangerous it would be, but it never seemed to be dangerous at all, with the exception of a few spots of high barge traffic past Baton Rouge.  The killer was the lack of current and you have to paddle into the wind 9 days out of 10.  Ugh.  Many days I felt it was physically harder than hiking, and for me it was mentally harder as well.  One day we had to paddle to a stump, tie up and rest, then shoot for another stump or the wind would blow us back north.

It's a basic app I created to get accurate forecasts based on which mile or shelter you're at without having to deal with bloated and ad ridden commercial apps which I found difficult to use on the trail. Basically, you don't need to waste battery waiting for a GPS lock, or manually enter a zip code or nearby town to find the forecast.

The app uses an incredibly small amount of data to get forecasts so it's decently speedy even in poor coverage and 2g networks of mountain towns.

It's free, so check it out, leave some feedback if you wish.

Even when a shelter had two trails going out, I went out the same one I came in on. I carried my whole pack with everything in it up Katahdin.

I carried a tiny stone from Springer and wedged it into the big cairn on top of K.

If I changed anything, I would have taken more time to do it. I did my thru-hike in 5 and a half months, and although it didn't seem like I sprinted through it, I know I would have enjoyed it more had I planned on doing the whole thing in 6.5 months.

He started his last leg in the beginning of June. He was by himself, he was an older gentleman and he was one of the kindest men I have ever met. He inspired my 62 year old father who rode a desk his whole life that he can do this. He became our hero. Our biggest regret was not taking a picture with him.

How likely am I to find any thru-hikers spending the night at a shelter on that part of the trail around this time of year?

It looks like input generated from the initial posting of it in there has petered out, so I'm posting the draft here in it's own thread to get wider feedback. 

I've taken a pass through it to try to organize it and to pare it down somewhat.  We were up over 6000 words at one point, which may be overkill for an FAQ. 

It is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLUW_250GtbnSF0Az2va_2plwiKSRkvKMZ5idykBm-M/edit) as a google doc that anyone can add to or edit. 

So, what did we miss?  What did we babble on too long about?  If we've missed a topic that should be covered, feel free to add it yourself, or just post a suggestion here.

I have been researching thru-hiking the AT for years now and have poured through many a trail journal and gear list. Much has been penned/typed hashing out the esoteric bits and pieces, while successful thru-hikers tend to gloss over or round (understandably) the raw data.

My aim for this post is to draw upon the thru-hiker community to give prospective thru-hikers a quantitative idea of what they're up against. We've all read accounts of people making it by on $1,500 and some blowing through $7,000.

I don't know how though, I don't recall twisting or rolling it but I guess the rocks got the better of me. I know I shouldn't walk on it until the swelling goes away but then I still need to take it easy for a few weeks until its all healed.

The thing is, slowing down on this terrain in PA would mean going super slow. I figure that I could yellow blaze north to an easier section and hike slow until I'm healed then come back to PA and yellow blaze back to where I left off.

The thing is, I've been hearing mixed reports about when the terrain gets easier. Some say it's 40 miles past the PA-NJ border. Some say it goes on through NY. So I figured I'd ask this subreddit where I should go.

I'm a 19 year old female who will be hiking alone. From doing tons of research on this subreddit, whiteblaze, and trailjournals.com I have a pretty good sense of how safe the trail is. I'm going to always be careful and cautious: never hitch alone, never tell a stranger I'm alone (tell them I've got friends coming up behind me or something), don't stick around anyone who makes me uncomfortable, etc. From what I've heard, I don't expect to have much of a problem feeling unsafe or threatened, especially because I plan to make friends and form a hiking group pretty quickly.


I'm having some trouble convincing my parents that I won't get abducted or murdered out there though. Can you guys help me out with some anecdotal evidence of how safe the trail is? And any other safety tips would be appreciated as well. 


Here are some things I'd appreciate you speaking about from personal experience:

-number of people at shelters every night (I plan on sleeping in or near shelters for the most part), especially for a nobo leaving in March

-general kindness of thru hikers and sense of community between hikers

-your experience making friends and finding hiking partners if you started out alone (or even if you didn't)

-any emergencies you heard about or witnessed on trail (ex: someone getting hurt and needing help)

So what was your lowest point on the AT? How did you cope with it? What did you take away from the experience?  

My lowest point was probably during the last few days before I summitted.  I sliced my wrist open on a rock night-hiking into the hundred mile wilderness, so that sort of set the tone for the next few days--initially I saw it as a race to Katahdin against infection. 

I went into the hundred mile knowing I was going to come out very hungry, and I was right.  

It all came to a head at Rainbow Lake, where I got maybe an hour or two of sleep because the mosquitos were relentless.  When I did fall asleep I woke myself up a few times because I was on mosquito-attack-autopilot and I managed to slap myself awake.  

I made it to Abol Bridge hungry and haggard, where I found out I was pretty much out of money. Thankfully my buddy helped me out, but that was a solid ego blow on top of everything else. 

But I was also only 15 miles from Katahdin at that point, and I knew what I had to do to get there.  So I just said fuck it and walked. It was all completely worth it. Can't wait for the next long distance hike.

TL;DR: Don't worry about it, I'm just long-winded right now because I miss rambling.  But share your lowest point."	t5_2stbz	True

I settled on thru-hiking the AT early this year. I'm just about down to 5 months to go 'til my departure date. Getting pumped, doing some training, but now it's time to really get my gear finalized....and I'm a bit overwhelmed by the market selection. I'm trying my best to go Ultra Light. I've bought my sleeping gear (this is the one category where I'm allotting more weight than an UL hiker would normally - If I don't sleep well I don't think I stand much of a chance making to to Maine) : 

* Big Agnes Roxy Ann 15 degree womens petite bag and Big Agnes Insulated Air Core (the pad slides into the bag, together they total 67 oz)

I've also bought my cookware:

* MSR Pocket Rocket Stove (3oz), Titanium pot w/lid, cup and spork (don't have the exact weight for these but they are *light*), and will use an 8oz IsoPro fuel canister.

I've also bought some of my clothes, hiking poles, little gear items and have decided on buying a SteriPen for water purification. What I'm having trouble deciding on is my shelter, shoes and bag. 

SHELTER - For a while I was considering a bivy tarp combo for shelter but the more I think about being in the tight quarters of a bivy for 6 months (especially in the summer!) the more I am leaning to getting an UL tent. Right now the Shangra-La 1 with bug nest is on the top of my list. It gives me so many options for such little weight (just over 2 lbs for the tarp, bug nest w/floor, and stakes). I can use the whole combo, just the tarp, or just the bug nest for when it's hot as balls. I guess I'm pretty sold, but I am looking for real peoples experiences with the tent and other possible options before I splurge. 

SHOES - I have heavy duty hiking boots, but I really can't stand the weight and confinement (I usually only wear sandals and Vibram FiveFingers). I would love to take my Sport Treks but on long distance hikes they KILL my little toes. Can anyone recommend light to mid weight shoes in a reasonable price range, about $100 or less that could stand up to the AT?

BAG - This is going to be the last thing I buy to assure that I don't get one too big or too small. I want something light, with built in suspension, and preferably a bottom compartment for my sleeping bag. Again, any recommendations, advice, etc.?

Sorry this post has gotten quite long! Any input would be Much Appreciated! Happy Trails!

EDIT: I've decided against the SteriPen and plan on using AquaMira.

1354198230.0	13zrow	a new kind of trail guide	monkey_matt	20	5	16	"When I was on the trail this summer, there were a bunch of times where something in the guidebook was wrong.  Sometimes, water sources were dry.  Sometimes, businesses had gone out of business.  Sometimes, the elevations or distances were off.  This wasn't a huge deal if you had met a hiker coming from the other direction and you could ask about conditions up ahead - but what if you didn't?

Right now, you've pretty much got two options for trail guides: AWOL's guide and the Companion.  Both come out once a year, both have errors and both cost money. 

It's 2012 - almost 2013!  Why are we still relying on these paper-based, once-a-year, maintained-by-one-person guides?  Can't we just combine what we all know about the trail to create a single, authoritative guide to the trail?  How about something that's easily accessible - i.e. something your friends and family can use to follow you along your hike?

So, I thought I would try to build something myself.  Here it is: [wikitrail.org](http://www.wikitrail.org/trails/view/at/appalachian-trail)  I called the site wikitrail because it's content comes from its users and everything can be edited.

At the moment, I've added all of the shelters, POs, some of the hostels and some of the more major road crossings.  If this site is going to be as useful as either of the guides already in use, it's going to need a lot more content (esp. water sources and town info).  I'm going to keep adding more information to the trail, but if this site is going to sustain itself, then it's going to need input from other people too.  Also, my data comes from 2011 with a few edits based on my experience this summer - so, if you see anything out of date in what I've added, please feel free to fix it.  

If things go well, I would love to expand the site to include other trails like the PCT, CDT and Camino de Santiago.  Guides for those trails are either super-inaccurate, expensive or non-existent.

So what do you think, reddit?  Is this the kind of thing that would work well with crowd-sourcing, or are people happy with the traditional system?

I hike often, and have done several multi-day hikes by myself; Still, friends and relatives seem to have some concerns about through-hiking alone, so I told thought I'd ask you guys:

* Do many people start alone? approximately what is the percentage?
* I've understood that people tend to form groups, how easy is this? and is it common.
* Other than common sense things, are there things that someone hiking alone shouldn't do that people hiking in groups can do?
* What are the odds of a person hiking alone, ending up in some sort of trouble (for example: sprained/broken ankle) where he won't be able to reach help? whereas a partner would be there and able to help? Sorry if this is vague, what I'm trying to ask is: is there a chance that I'll break an ankle and no one will be around for days to help me?
* Is it worth it to get one of those emergency locator beacons?

Also, a gear question

* Is it feasible to take a sleeping bag rated around ~35F and a liner, and once the weather warms up just use the sleeping bag instead of switching?

Thanks! looking forward to seeing everybody on the trail.

1341894369.0	wb8bi	Found a great beginner hike in PA	praetordave	17	2	5	"I'm an intermediate hiker and my girlfriend told me she wanted to try some backpacking, so I started looking around for trails.  This past weekend we had our first trip together and it was a blast.  

We parked my car at the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, located at the lehigh water gap.  We had a friend drop us off at PA 309, about 13 miles away.  The road rises up to meet the trail, so there was no initial uphill hike to get onto the trail.  The first several miles were all flat and wide, perfect for inexperienced hikers to get their footing.  There was some rock scrambling at the knife's edge and bake oven knob, but it was still fairly easy.  We stayed at the bake oven knob shelter overnight, which was about 6 miles from our start.  Next day we hiked out to the nature center at the water gap.  This day was a little over 7 miles, had less rocks and was mostly downhill all day.

Are there any places to park just north or south of the Tennessee border?  If so, do any shuttles do pickups from those areas?  

My initial though was to find the closest parking area to the border and get a shuttle to take me to Springer Mountain, but I do not know how feasible this actually is.

1343107489.0	x257w	Fantasizing about hiking the AT in 2013. Am I crazy?		18	5	23	"After doing a day hike of a short section of the Appalachian Trail recently and talking to a few thru-hikers on the way, I've gotten really buzzed about the idea of doing a thru-hike myself. I've spent a good amount of time reading up on the trail and thru-hiking, and everything I see just gets me more excited about the idea. 

I was thinking that I would put it off for years, but as I'm graduating from college this winter, I've been realizing that there's no telling how long it will be before I have another opportunity to do something nuts like this, and whether I'll still be in the right frame of mind to accomplish it. Lately I've been so caught up in what I should do with my life after I graduate, and this is the first idea I've seen which has really inspired me. 

My main worry is that I have very little backpacking experience right now. I've been on quite a few mountainous day hikes before, but I've only ever done one overnight backpacking trip in a group. I've always loved it, of course, but I know hiking two days is a far cry from hiking 6 months. 

I don't think any of my good friends would be up to do this, so I'll likely be setting out alone. What sort of experience should I get in order to make sure that starting the AT alone won't be a disaster? Would a week-long backpacking trip be enough practice to feel safe on the trail? (I figure this would also be smart since I sure as hell can't do the AT if I can't make it through a week's hike.) I'm just trying to figure out whether this is a pipe dream or a real feasible thing that I could do. "	t5_2stbz	True

I was wondering if anybody wouldn't mind answering some questions that have been bugging me:

1. If you start off in Georgia in March, I'd imagine that many of you had to deal with snow and freezing temperatures. How do your feet stay warm in those conditions if you're hiking in trail runners or hiking shoes? They don't look very warm.

2. If you're walking in the rain and wet conditions, how do you keep your feet dry? Won't your feet get infected and blistered if they stay wet too long?

3. How do you keep your gear dry while hiking in the rain? Do you cover the bag in something while it' son your back?

4. I've noticed many trail meals are fat and carbohydrate laden but are fairly lacking in protein (i.e. pasta sides, granola, etc.). Am I missing something, or do you tend to deprive yourself of protein while hiking? Isn't that detrimental?

5. When you stay at one of the shelters located along the trail, what's the procedure for sleeping? Do you sleep inside the shelter? Do you set up your tent outside the shelter?

6. When you have to leave the trail for a zero day, does it cause a lot of problems to walk into a town smelling and looking the way you do? I understand that a lot of towns are prepared for hikers and wouldn't bat an eye, but it seems some towns, especially in NY, CT and MA, don't really know much about the AT. Do some of the people ever give you trouble?

7. How do you wash your clothes as you go? Do you even wash them?

8. How do you bathe as you go? Do you even bathe?

9. How can you clean your cookware?

10. How do you dry your clothes after they get wet? It seems like people generally recommend you don't make fires while hiking the AT, so I don't know how you'd go about drying your stuff in cold or wet conditions.

I've been hiking in synthetic shorts for a long time now, but in the past it's always been with boxer briefs underneath. I've been reading that a lot of people just go commando in hiking shorts because they usually come with that mesh liner. I figured I would try it out just to save a few ounces. So I did, and my shorts totally smell like BO now. Never had this problem before. Anyone notice the same thing? Why does the mesh liner in my hiking shorts hold onto BO so much more than my cotton boxer briefs?

At this point I've pretty much resigned myself to bringing two pairs of underwear and dealing with the extra weight. I know I know, those six extra ounces are totally gonna break my back : P

Maybe I'll switch to synthetic boxers so they'll dry faster, but does anyone know if synthetic boxers have the same stinky issues? I'll probably just try them out to experiment. I figured I would throw the question out there just for fun.  "	t5_2stbz	True

Also its my first time leaving not just the state I live in, but leaving the island I live on.

I'm TRYING to it all out, but I just can't decide.  It seems that many hikers start early these days--late feb to mid march.  If I start then, it might be too crowded.  But if I start later, it might not be crowded enough.  I DO want to meet people.  If I wanted to be all alone, I would go to Alaska.  There is also the weather.  An early start promises to get you through the mid-Atlantic before the summer gets too hot and humid. But that can result in very nasty conditions (snow, cold rain) in the southern Appalachians.  And you'll probably miss the fall foliage in New England.  A later start (like April 15th) pretty much guarantees hot and muggy conditions in Penna. and, possibly, a race to make it to Katahdin before the snow starts falling in October.  I would also imagine that if I didn't start until mid-April, I would utterly hate going to work each and every day.  I would be SO itchy to get on the trail.

So I really don't know.  My feeling is that I'll probably want to start sometime between March 15th and April 1sth, but I'm really not sure.  Got a perspective on this issue?  I can say that I would feel very uncomfortable with a February start, and that I wouldn't want to start that deep into April.  Historically, March 1sth, March 15th, March 21st and April 1st are popular starting dates although it seems that people are starting earlier and earlier.  I would like to avoid those exact dates.  Maybe do something like starting someday in March during the middle of the week...

I keep thinking about the Storm of the Century in mid-March of 1993.  If a bad storm happened, I could lose a week of walking (or just move very slowly), which could totally erase the benefits of an earlier start.

TL;DR: when should I start?"	t5_2stbz	True

1373314142.0	1hvwik	Question about New Hampshire part of my hike	HikingtheAT	17	4	33	"Posted this on /r/hiking but then found there was a subreddit more specific to my needs.

In a week I'll be leaving for a hike in the AT from New York state to the New Hampshire-Maine state border. I've planned out all the walking starting with smallish days of 5-10 miles and then averaging 15-20 miles a day after the first week. I've hiked all of Maine on the AT already so I know my capabilities and limits. I've planned it out so that I resupply every two weeks, twice during the whole trip. I'm not into the ultralight hiking deal.

After reviewing details, I'm concerned about the White Mountain range in New Hampshire. I had planned to do about 12 miles a day at most there but seeing that I'm a student and I don't have the cash to pay 100$ for a night in a hut (as opposed to the 8$ a night in campsites/tentsites). I planned the section to be hiked without the use of huts which did leave two days to be quite long, one is supposed to be 19 miles and the other is supposed to be 22 miles in between campsites.

Normally, a 20 mile day wouldn't be a big deal at my pace and I've done them in Maine many times. Except I just read on the AT site that a hiker should only plan 5-8 miles a day in the White Mountain range. I've never done the Whites so I have no experience for that section of trail. I will have about 400 miles of hiking in me by the time I reach them though, if that's a factor.

Weather allowing, I would leave as soon as the sun is up and walk until I reach my destination, stopping only if nature calls and for my official ""lunch"".

Does this part of my hiking plan seem sound or am I stretching it a bit considering the location I'll be hiking those miles in? What are your opinions, thoughts, possible alternatives, and/or solutions to this issue."	t5_2stbz	True

I don't know civilian gear at all though. I was thinking about maybe using a medium ALICE pack with civilian straps and pads, but those things get pretty damn uncomfortable after a while.

I saw someone here suggesting the REI Flash 62, but frankly I don't think it's gonna cut it. People are saying it starts to get uncomfortable above 30 lbs, and I plan on carrying at least 40. 80-120 lbs is about what I used to carry back in the army, and 20+ mile hikes in a day weren't unusual. I know rough terrain changes things, so 40 lbs and 3000 cubic inches is about my target.

As far as sleep systems, I'm planning to bring the current generation modular sleep system that the army issues, rated to -50*F. Is that overkill? And with a bivy sack, and shelters along the way, do I really need a tent, or will a tarp and bungie cords cut it for rainy days?

Last question is snow shoes. I have no experience with these. I want to keep my 0 days to a minimum, but reading some other peoples reports, getting snowed in is pretty common during this time of year. Should I start out carrying them, or buy some along the way once I start hitting heavy snow? Or should I just do without and have a few 5 mpd weeks along the way?

This is my first attempt, and it's probably insane, but I'm gonna give it my best shot.

1346768271.0	zc42h	Did I break a record?	protargol	14	2	13	"I did a SOBO hike last year from July 11 till Jan 12.  Most of that was by myself so I tended to push hard and long.  I routinely night hiked and was very comfortable doing it.  When I hit Pen-Mar, I decided to do the 4 state challenge and ended up doing it in 16 some odd hours.  That wet my appetite.  After that, I became fixated on the idea of seeing how far I could go in a ""day"" and started planning for a 24 hr hike.  When I hit Partnership shelter, I had a full moon night and hoped to get to Damascus in 24 hours.  That time I fell a few miles short and ended up doing 58 miles I believe.  I knew I could do 60 and was pretty bummed I fell short.  So by the end of my hike, I promised to try again.  My second to last day hiking, I left from a forest road outside of Franklin NC early in the morning and hiked for 23 hours and 36 minutes to a little past Neel's Gap to make it an even 66 miles. 

I saw this [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/yx600/miles_per_day_the_importance_of_effective_use_of/c5zsdr5) and was curious where that came from.  My total distance over time was under 3 mph, but in order to do that, I had to crank out 4 mph - 3.5 mph for a significant part of the day in order to prepare for the slowdown that results in hiking for 24 hours straight.  This would have most likely put me above 3 mph for 15 hours or a so called record.  I don't have my exact mileage and times documented, but I have photos and timestamps and can try to calculate from those.

For the record, I had my gf give me water twice and a food drop, but it was very meager assistance.  I did this with my pack and everything I needed to survive if need be.  So my question is this: how remarkable was this feat?  And also how do I get a tag put next to my name!?"	t5_2stbz	True

1340373358.0	vfojf	First section hike done	ganley	12	0	12	"My daughter (Achilles) and I (Rain Man) just finished our first section hike - 50 miles of Shenandoah National Park. It was both of our first time backpacking and first time on the AT. I've car-camped a hundred times before, but I was surprised to find that having everything on your back, and not having a base to return to each night, felt totally different in a good way. I can't even find the words to describe how much we loved it.

Aside from just saying ""woo-hoo!"", I wanted to share the basics of my gear and mention a few things I learned that might be helpful to other newbies like us, and let the more experienced hikers offer any further suggestions.

Big three: REI Flash 62 pack (3lb2oz), REI 55-degree travel sack (1lb11oz), and ALPS Zephyr 1 tent (3lb14oz). Daughter's big three are different but similar in style and weight. Thermarest z-lite pad. Pocket rocket stove and Snow Peak titanium mess kit. Aqua Mira for water purification.

Total pack weight, including 2L of water and (too much) food: 33 lbs.

Things I'd leave out next time: GPS (didn't use it), sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses (didn't use; they might be necessary on more open sections of trail), half of my first-aid kit, trowel (just use a stick or your boot to dig the hole).

Things I'd change:

* Empty Gatorade bottles in place of Nalgenes (1oz vs. 5.6oz); this was the biggest suggestion I got from the thru-hikers we sheltered with.
* Cheap rain poncho in place of nice 1-pound packable raincoat.
* A lighter multi-tool; my Leatherman Wave is just over half a pound.
* Lighter boots. Mine are great for any terrain and any weather, which means they're overkill about 98% of the time, and they weigh almost 5 pounds. Before next time I'll get some trail shoes or something.

That would knock a few pounds off. After that I don't think there's  much to lose without switching out the big three for more ultralight-style gear.

Things I'd add:

* A deck of cards or some kind of game. One thru-hiker I met had a scrabble board drawn on his sleeping pad; presumably he was carrying scrabble tiles. I thought that was cool. If you also drew a checkboard you could use scrabble tiles as checkers too (face-up vs. face-down), and maybe draw chess pieces on the backs of some. In a gift shop I saw a bandana with a checkerboard printed on it.

I'm wondering how long r/AT thinks it would take to get from Jo Mary Road to ME 15, app. 75 miles. I know the terrain is tough but we are hoping to knock it off in a week (1 day to get the Maine from CT, 5-6 days hiking, 1 day drive back to CT.)

Anyway, have been thinking about gear since my first long hike on the AT a few years ago could have been better and I want to iron out details ahead of time.

1.  Do you use a tent or hammock?  I want to use a hammock, are they hard to set up on the trail?  Are they worth it?  What kind do you use and what is a decent price for one (with rain fly and netting).

2.  What do you use for water?  I personally have a filter that attaches to the bottles.  Yeah, it's a bit bulky and I could use iodine, but I think its the one thing that I really enjoy having on the trail.  I can get by without most things, but I like my clean water :)

3.  What is your favorite piece of gear that you wouldn't want to live without?  

4.  How many of you fish on the way.  I was thinking it might be fun to bring some line and a couple of hooks.  Not for necessity, but happening to catch a few fish for dinner would be a nice change from the typical food.  I'm not sure where I would dispose of the remains though or where that would be legal.

I'm planning on flying into Roanoke (from Hawaii) and (hopefully) meeting my friend somewhere in that vicinity, hiking with him for two weeks, and then returning to Roanoke to catch a flight to Ohio. Since I'm coming from Hawaii and am headed to Ohio, and after that Alaska, after my section hike, I'm going to have a bunch of stuff that I can't take on the trail with me. Do any of you know if there are any good options for storing a duffle bag while I'm on the trail that I can then pick up when I'm done?

1354676874.0	14aurb	Anxiety about committing to the trail?		14	2	18	"So, I posted a few months ago about my musings to hike the AT. Since then, I had sort of let it drop out of my mind because I started to make some life plans for next year through the spring, and I figured that I could just think again about doing it in 2014.

Long story short, my life plans for the spring have been falling apart. It looks like if I stick with my current plan, for reasons I won't go into, I'll be hanging around with a fresh engineering degree waiting tables full-time for 6 months. I just can't imagine myself being happy in this situation. I realized a week or so ago that the AT has suddenly again become an incredibly desirable option for my life next year.

However, I'm having trouble mentally committing to it. Doing it will probably require an almost-immediate effort to sublet out my current room (with roommates who I really adore) for the remainder of my lease and find a new place I can live in temporarily, secure a full-time temp job and remain very frugal up until March and possibly take money out of savings, and find a new home for my pet cat.

All of this stuff is doable, and I think it'd be worth it, because hiking the AT is literally the only option I've thought of for my life in the next year that is still plausible and that actually actively excites me. I'm pretty confident that it would be awesome. The stuff I'd be giving up is all nice, but nothing life-changing like this could be.

But I'm still not yet able to shake the voice in my head that's reminding me that it could be terrible. I have visions of myself going, not knowing what I'm doing, not being able to get along with anyone, getting sick of hiking after a week, etc., and dropping out of the trail after having moved heaven and earth to get there. It would be horribly, horribly depressing.

I'm especially worried (while being simultaneously excited) about the social aspect of it. I'd be going alone, and while not a basement dweller by any means, I'm pretty introverted and have trouble with just walking up to people and talking to them. I think it'd be awesome if all goes well and I come up with a great trail family and meet all sorts of wacky new people who are as crazy as I am. I feel like it's also possible I'd work up a bunch of social anxiety when stressed out by my first days on the trail, and then just sort of be scared to talk to anyone, and turn into a miserable loner. I feel like I never hear about this sort of thing, but I still can't shake the image. 

Thru-hikers (prospective and past): How did you guys get over these sorts of anxieties about ""what if it all turns out terrible?"" I feel like I'm one good pep talk away from telling everyone I'm doing it, putting up ads to get rid of my room and my cat, and starting gear hunting. I really want to do this so much and I know that it's in my power, but I just am having trouble working up the nerve.

**Hygiene** - How often did you get a chance to shower or wash during your trip? Even if you only showered every few days, what did you do DAILY to maintain a basic level of cleanliness?

**Medical Issues** - The above question was also due to some mild psoriasis that flares up if I don't get a chance to wash daily. Did you have any medical issues you needed to take care of regularly when hiking, and how did you do it?

**Injuries** - Did you injury yourself at all during your trip? What happened and how did you cope? How long were you off trail if at all? I have an ankle I twisted 4 months back, and it's 95% healed, but it can become a problem quickly again if I'm not careful.

Leaving in roughly a month. Not sure if I'm going solo or a friend or cousin will join me.

At most I've only done five days of backpacking, and found that to be such a tease! I'm thinking I'll probably head north from Fontana Dam, enjoy the Smokies, and make it to at least Max Patch, maybe further if I feel like it. I'm good on gear, and have family members that hike quite often. My dad actually got married on Max Patch last year! His wife is a badass and does solo hikes like this all the time. So surely I can get a lot of info and tips from them.

One thing I'm looking forward to is meeting interesting people. I'd really like to have a zero day somewhere neat, perhaps Hot Springs, and drink the shit out of some beer.

Two women were killed in 1996, and then this year, Nature Boy (who was going for an unsupported Appalachian Trail speed record) was pulled out of his tent and beaten (in Virginia).  Then, in August, a hiker was found in a shallow grave (if I'm not mistaken, in Virginia.)  


Since the crime seems especially limited everywhere else on the trail when compared to Virginia, what is it that makes this region problematic?  Is it the proximity to the road in some parts of the trail?  Or, just chance?  


I swear I'm not trying to fear-monger, but I'm legitimately speculating about what may cause one area to be more trouble than all of the rest. I realize that the four incidents that I can think of does not make this part of the trail ""dangerous"" when thousands of hikers walk through with no problem, but there seems to be a potential pattern, and I'm wondering what may potentially cause this."	t5_2stbz	True

Basically, my dad is an incredibly straight-laced guy with traditional ideas about what makes a person successful. I guess you could say he's like Red Foreman, but without the tender moments. He's not a bad man, but his parenting style isn't very warm. I feel like though I've done my best to live up to his expectations (sometimes to my detriment), I have still been less than successful. I've learned to care a lot less, but his opinion of me still matters.

Anyway, I finally decided it was time to tell him about my hiking plans and he basically told me that it was my life and that's important that I accomplish what I want to accomplish and that I need to do what I think is best for me. It really couldn't have gone better. Although, I know I still have a lot of odds and ends and preparation to do, I can't help but feel that I am a whole lot closer. Anyway, good luck to anyone that is feeling this way about revealing their hike to a loved one. You can do it. Hell, even if they're not supportive, many other people will be. Good luck!

I am 5'11"" and 135 pounds. This is verging on underweight. I have heard that weight loss is very difficult to avoid, and I can't really afford to lose much weight. I know it should be a simple ""eat more, gain weight,"" but for the life of me I can't gain weight. So my question is: how much should this be a serious concern for me?

I got off the trail in early June after going NOBO from Springer to Harpers Ferry. It was mainly to work, although there were some other trail ""vacation"" things involved. I'll be returning to the trail in late July, but I'm not sure where.

Option 1: return to Harper's and hike NOBO. This was the original plan  (saving Katahdin and New England for the glorious end), but I'll be waaaay at the back of the pack and there'll be a serious time crunch to make it to Baxter State Park before the weather deteriorates.

Option 2: Start in Maine, go south. It would be neat to cross paths with everyone I met going NOBO, and I could finish after the Shenandoahs (which I aquablazed).  Also (... I'm just fantasizing at this point because I'm off the trail) potential for a full SOBO thru.

Option 3: meet up with friends who will likely be somewhere in New England and finish the trail in sections. The only reason this is an option is because I LOVE the social aspect of the trail. I've heard that going SOBO is more solitary. It would be a pain to arrange this, though.

2. Money. How much physical currency should I carry? I was thinking $100 at a time, broken into 10-$1s, 2-$5s, 4-$20s. And most grocery stores, lodges/motels/hotels accept Visa correct?  
3. Guidebook ... The A.T. Guide, but do I need the full set of pocket profiles, as well?   
4. Layering? Will I need layers for the summer? I intend on packing either my Flylow jacket or my Mountain Hardwear MicroChill Zip T. Is a down jacket necessary (think Montbell UL Down Jacket). But, my dad can resupply me/exchange gear with me in MD/PA/NJ.  
5. Compass, Sunscreen, Lip Balm, Whistle, Insect Repellent, Trowel, Sanitizer ... What is necessary and what is unnecessary? What is suggested/recommended?   
Note: I am of a darker complexion, so I usually never wear sunscreen ... even in higher altitudes, above treeline (Philmont Scout Ranch).   
6. Water filter or Aquamira?
7. Blogging platform preferences? (Trail Journal, blogspot, wordpress, tumblr)   
8. Bear bagging protocol? Obviously in the southern Appalachians, Smokies, and SNP. And I'm a bit rusty, would other hikers help me?"	t5_2stbz	True

I am hitting the trail in mid March and heading all the way to Katahdin!  I was hoping to hear from some of you as to what you think of the gear I have selected to use so far.  Very little has been purchased, but I will be starting that up after getting some feedback here and maybe a similar post to WhiteBlaze.  I am waiting on choosing a pack until I have the majority of my other gear finalized.  Money isn't a *huge* issue, but it's not like I have an unlimited budget (if I can save money and keep quality, I will!)  Anyways, here is my working list (numbers are weight in oz.)

 * Platypus 3.0 L Big Zip Reservoir - 5.8
 * Aquamira - 4.0
 * Zpacks cuben roll top food bag - 1.4
 * Lighter - 0.6
- Clothing (everything is listed, including worn clothes).  I don't know the weight on some of these items, either.
 * Shopping boots right now.  I just picked up some Vasque Wasatch GTX.  They felt good at the store, so I am going to take them out and see how I like them.  I am a big guy and sprained my ankle last May, so I am not planning on doing the trail runner thing.
 * Marmot Essence Rain Jacket - 6.0

 * REI Revelcloud Insulated Jacket (with hood) - 12.5
 * Smartwool hiking socks (2 pair)

 * Smartwool long sleeve crew neck t-shirt

 * Smartwool long underwear
 * Patagonia Bettter Sweater Fleece - 16.0

I've never used trekking poles, but it seems like the vast majority of AT finishers have them.  I'm planning to hike the AT next year and am young, fairly small, with good knees.  I'm also trying to save on money and weight just like everyone else and I prefer a running descent downhill rather than a plodding one.

I can talk for hours and hours about the trail but it just sucks not being able to relate to people.

**BEST**
(No particular order)


**Shaws/Lake House, Monson ME**
Can't go wrong with either of these places, and you'll probably spend time at both in Monson. Fabulous breakfast at Shaws, tasty ""all you can eat taco"" specials at Lake House (try to beat my record of 21.5 soft beef).

**Green Mountain House, Manchester VT.**
Jeff is a great owner, and goes out of his way to help often. Rides around town, clean sheets and home, great functional kitchen (for when all you want is cooking a huge meal of your own) and most importantly, a free pint of Ben and Jerry's with your stay!

**Kincora Hostel, Hampton TN**
When Bob Peoples goes hiking, mice bring HIM food. A legendary Appalachian Trail haunt that can't be missed on a thru-hike.

**Palmerton ""Jail"" Hostel, Palmerton PA**
The kind people of Palmerton open up the basement of their city borough hall for thru-hikers. No donation necessary and one of the best showers (although that may just be because I was especially stanky) on the whole Trail.

**The AT Lodge, Millinocket Maine**
Either the end or the beginning for many thru-hikers. I spent two great nights there, most of the first day after my thru-hike drinking beer and Jack and Coke and watching copious amounts of Sportscenter. Navi-Gator and Ole Man are great hosts and the Appalachian Trail Cafe was one of my favorite places on the trail.

**Tom Levardi's, Dalton MA**
Not a hostel, but a home in every sense of the word. Levardi is a trail legend for good reason. Another must stay for anyone thru-hiking the AT.







**WORST**


**Pine Ellis, Andover ME**
Over-priced, not the nicest lodging, and they were selling food out of the hiker box. I get it that the town is dying, but not cool. Prepare to be nickel and dimed until you set foot back on the Trail.

**Standing Bear Hostel, NC**
""Workers"" that push drugs and are generally Deliverance type hillbillies. And not the cool kind.

**White House Landing, Hundred Mile Wilderness, ME**
I didn't stay here personally, because I heard about how horrible it was. Throwing a stink when a hiker asked to charge his cell phone and camera batteries, not having any bedding, and charging people egregious amounts to stay. One thru-hiker had a $110 tab for a bunk, breakfast, a burger, and Aquamira.

EQUIPMENT: total weight approximately twenty pounds.

* Framepack--A.L.I.C.E type pack or similar, with large pocket removed.
* Poncho--serves as raincoat, parka, groundcloth, shelter cloth, etc.
* Rainhat--indispensable because of variable weather.
* Sheath knife--small size. Pocket knife as auxiliary.
* Small axe--necessary for maintaining campfire in rainy weather.
* Compass, waterproof matchsafe, snakebite kit-just in case.
* Cook kit-- Military Mountain kit or similar (two nested kettles and frypan)
* Sleeping bag--blanket type (April-October), down in winter.
* Extra set of clothing--for added warmth, rather than heavy underwear, and as a dry change after a rainy day.
* Socks--(heavy) reinforced wool or spun nylon.
* Canteen--flat, one quart.
* First aid kit--include foot powder, insect repellent etc.
* Headnet, flashlight, plastic food bags.


FOOD: Staples: cornmeal, oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, salt, raisins, potatoes, powdered milk, rice, dried meats, dried fruits, dehydrated vegetables (if available). I plan on supplementing this with store food.  

FOOTWEAR: Moccasin-type leather boots with nine-inch tops (protect ankles from sprain, bruise, snakebite).  I prefer boots to low cut shoes.  

I like things simple so no tent, bulky sleeping bag, cans or jars, air mattress, large sheath knife, large axe, bulky jacket or overcoat, conventional raincoat, firearms.

I know I could probably answer most of these questions myself with a bit of reading, but I'll be working 12 hours a day between now and then, so I won't have a lot of time to research.  

Our backgrounds:
I've never done a multi-day hiking trip, but I've been to the Smokies a dozen times, and Shenandoah a couple of times. I've day-hiked parts of the trail, and what I've been on seemed pretty easy. My friend is from Colorado, and she's done week-long hikes in the Rockies, but she's never seen the AT. We're setting a pace of 10 miles a day, because her experience in the Rockies leads her to believe that's all she can do.  

My plan:
I'd like to take a shuttle from Clingman's Dome in the Smokies to some point about 40-50 miles away, and hike back to my Jeep. It doesn't have to be Clingman's Dome, but that seems like a good spot. Would any other sections of the trail be better this time of year?  

Gear - I've got:  
-North Face Terra 65 pack  
-Steripen water purification system  
-A 1-liter canteen  
-50 feet of para cord  
-a lightweight windbreaker and a good poncho  
-first aid kit  
-toiletries, sunscreen, insect repellant  
-a decent amount of food  
-clothes, obviously  
-my friend has a camping stove and pot, and all the gear she needs  

I still need:  
-Bear bag for food  
-Sleeping bag  
-Tent (or do I?) (I'm leaning toward the REI Passage 1)  
-I'd like to pick up a ka-bar knife   

Am I missing anything? I know there are shelters every 5-10 miles on this part of the trail, will I even need a tent? Are there places to pitch a tent? Will the shelters be overflowing this time of year?  

I checked the weather forecast for Gatlinburg, the lows are supposed to be around 60 degrees on the nights I'll hiking. How much colder does it get on the trail than it is down in the valleys?  

With regards to water -- how much should I carry with me? How frequent are sources of water on the trail?  

Any recommendations for a particular shuttle service? There are a lot to choose from in the Smokies.

I was hoping for a little privacy, as well as some solitude. Do they allow small campfires at this site as well? (she really would like to have a small campfire once the sun goes down.) Any thoughts, observations, or experiences are more than welcome.

Ideas?	doormatt_	10	1	3	"I was a prospective thru-hiker for 2013, but it unfortunately fell through due to money/general life stability concerns. (Fingers crossed I can make it happen for 2015!) Good news is it also looks like I may be able to take a week to hike a small section of the trail with a friend next month! However, I don't really know where to start on doing such a short section hike.

Ideally, we'd like to make a road trip of it and go to Maine or NH (from upstate NY where we live). Never been up there, but from what I've read, it looks to be the most awesome part of the AT. It's not set in stone by any means, though, so I'd definitely be interested if people think that there is some hike somewhere else that we absolutely must see.

My main concern is the question of getting back to where we started hiking. If we go substantially far away from home, there's not much of a chance we can get a friend to taxi us to and from there. If there's a cool loop that we could complete, that'd be nice- I just definitely don't want to just hike 20 miles and then backtrack 20 miles. I don't know if there's anywhere where we could catch a bus or something back to where we started. And obviously, I'd like to do a more interesting section of the trail if anyone is familiar with a good part of it.

I only have a bit of backpacking experience (but enough that I'm comfortable doing this), and my friend has almost none but is in good shape. So I'm guessing we could pull off a 10 mile/day pace or so.

I'll obviously be seeing if I can look stuff up on my own, but I'd figure I'd see if anyone has firsthand perspective. Thanks!"	t5_2stbz	True

So I'm 24 years old I recently graduated from college and started a new corporate job. I've been working retail for the past 6 years and have never taken more than 4 days off. In the past few years I've put on weight, started smoking and stopped exercising. 

When I was fresh out of high school I was an avid outdoorsman i hunted fished took day hikes and camped. I always wanted to do a section hike but never did. 

Past few weeks of my life have been annoying. First world personal problems etc... So I decided I'm finally going on this hike. I know there's a way for a guy that's out of shape but determined to do it with the right equipment and planning. 

I'm not too humble to hike on the kiddie trails because I'm out of shape I just want to spend 5-6 days alone in the wilderness traveling. 

Things i would love to do along the way:

Hunt (I have valid nj firearms license and hunting permits) Im not against buying a gun specifically for the trip if need be

Fish

Kayak

Meet other hikers/campers

Cliff diving 

What section do you recommend and what should I take into account while planning this trip?

I really appreciate any advice about how I can do this.

I really don't want to end this on a sour note but I'm getting a lot of people telling me to get in shape, quit smoking first etc,. I don't want to put it off any more. I'm doing this. I have personal reasons that make this something I must do.

Now, this is something I’ve wanted to do for as long as I can remember, but I definitely have some reservations. I would appreciate any feedback from the well of experience in this sub. I’ve done a good deal of research on the A.T.; including some reading on Reddit(shoutout to casual_redditor and rusty075 for some informative AMAs), so hopefully I won’t be asking a bunch of usual questions. 

* First of all – my most pressing concern – six months is a long time. Not that I wouldn’t mind winding down after college, but I absolutely hate being away from my girlfriend for that long. We’re not strangers to long-distance, as the first two years of our three-year relationship we spent the majority of time on opposite sides of the country, as I started my undergrad in Arizona and she her master’s in Connecticut. But during that we could Skype pretty much every night and of course text and call all day. Which is where my question comes in: how do hikers communicate with loved ones on the trail? If I brought a phone, would reception be a hassle? Is it frowned upon to bring a phone? If she wanted to come visit me at some point (all the way from Arizona), what’s the best way to coordinate that? 

* Secondly, a camera is a must, obviously. Any suggestions on what camera to bring? I currently shoot with an incredibly outdated but trusty Canon 20D, but I’ll probably be upgrading to a newer Rebel within a year or so. Do I want to avoid a DSLR to cut down on weight? Did anyone bring a tripod? 

* I think it’s safe to say I’m a pretty novice hiker. I spent four years in the Marine Corps, so I’ve done my fair share of trudging around with a lot of heavy shit, but I know that's not really the point of the A.T. Aside from that I’ve only ever done day hikes with pretty minimal weight. Since I won’t be hitting the trail for two years, I’d like to make the most of that time getting prepared. I figured I’m just going to try and hike a lot, or should I figure out a regimen of sorts? Also, does anyone know of some reliable resources to find a good overnight trail in Arizona? 

* Also, I don’t have a lot of gear questions – I have two years to figure that out – but I’m a pretty tall guy and was curious if anyone had suggestions for particular packs to look at? I’m 6’5”. Also, hiking poles. Are they necessary? I’ve never hiked with them, so I’m completely oblivious here. 

Thanks in advance.

I've already done the southern half (Springer to Harper's Ferry) and loved it.  Have a chance to go back this summer.  One option is to start again where I left off, in Harper's Ferry, then finish it (~1170 miles).  The other is to start at the Amtrak station in NY (Pawling I think), then head north to Katahdin (~740 miles).  This would leave time at the end of the summer to do some other traveling, and possibly fly out and hike the JMT, or relax and get fat again.  Saying I've done the whole thing would be cool, but it's much more important for me to simply enjoy the time, see some beautiful vistas, etc.  Anything worthwhile in PA, or is it just a pile of rocks as I've heard?

Well, my mom got kinda mad at me when I told him I wouldn't be available (joking, because really, it's my brother getting married...) and now I'm wondering what I should do in terms of hiking for the 2012 season.    

I wouldn't consider it a true thru-hike if I'm off the trail for like a week, week and a half in April, and I wouldn't really be able to afford the extra flights anyway.    

I live in CT, and have done about 50% of the trail between here and Katahdin as day hikes, so what I'm thinking is to just set out and do a stretch of it when I get back from the wedding (late April, early May) and go as far north as I feel like doing in one continuous trek, which I'm thinking will be somewhere around Mt. Washington. I don't think I'd want to go all the way to Katahdin, I'll save that for when I do a real thru-hike, sense of accomplishment and all that. And I feel Mt. Washington will be a good end to the smaller journey.    

The other option I have is to wait until it's about the right time where other northbound hikers are passing through the area (I'm not really sure when this will be, though... June-ish?) and try to meet up with a group doing a thru-hike and just tag along for a couple of weeks or something.

Water Gap to Hudson River in 2011, want to complete Hudson River to Bennington this summer.  I've lived in the Upstate NY region for most of my life, I'm pretty comfortable walking through the woods and falling asleep just about anywhere.

My question is this,
is there any point to carry in July in NY/CT/MA:
A Thermal jacket/vest?
Midweight Hiking socks?
Thermal bottoms, like Capilene 1 or Thermasilk?
Rain mitts?
very thin glove liners (why do I need these in July?)
Convertible pants?  I hiked 1400 miles in the summers of 2007 2008 and I don't think I used the pants legs more than twice.

---------------------------------------

I have:

* favorite shoes moab ventilators and Sole footbeds
* favorite socks ultralight coolmax hikers (2 pair)
* DirtyGirlGaiters
* 5oz Royal Robbins Fuse shorts (might swap to the running shorts with mesh mantra)
* ExOfficio Boxers
* ExOfficio Nio Amphi convertible pants (these are heavy compared to others, and it's July, why need pants?)
* DriDucks UL rain pants (might make into the every so fashionable rain skirt)
* Montbell dynamo wind pants

* Short sleeve quick dry shirt
* long sleeve quick dry shirt
* Montbell Tachyon anorak rain coat
* DriDucks rain coat

* Hat,
* cotton bandana
* turtle fur balaclava
* head bug net

SO what am I missing as far as clothing?

------------------

Second quick question, I live in upstate NY near the NY/NJ border part of the AT, where it is ""bear country"" in my front yard every garbage night.  Can people chime in if it's worth using a bear bag in this NY/CT/MA section?  I have to find/buy/make a silnylon/Opsak bear bag quickly if so.

------------------

Third quick question:
Running shorts with mesh liner and pockets, can anyone suggest good ones?

My boyfriend (age 27) and I (age 23) recently heard about the Appalachian Trail and something about it just jumped out at us as something we should do. We aim to do a NOBO thru-hike.

My boyfriend recently graduated college and I'm unemployed, so it feels like the perfect time. But... due to financial issues, and the prime starting time passing us by.. it seems like the best we could do is next year (2014) start date.

At least this will give us more time to prepare mentally and physically. I just hope we're at a point in our lives to do this thing next year!

So anyway, I had some questions I wanted to ask to help us be more prepared for next year.

* How in-shape do you need to be to start? If I must be honest, I was hoping to get in shape on the trail. we're both at least 100lbs overweight. I was wondering if anyone had experience with doing the trail as a weight-loss and fitness journey?

* Is there anyway to cut the costs of the trip? We're completely willing to not eat-out or sleep in motels while in town to save money. (We don't smoke, and we don't drink.) I read that the trail costs about $3,000 per person not including gear, is that the minimum for food and necessities?

* Gear: I read the FAQ on the right side, but I was wondering if there is a list of ""Bare necessities needed for a complete thru-hike""? or is that THE bare necessities? We need to cut costs as much as possible, to make the trip a reality...

* Meals: We're vegetarian. How much harder will it be for us to get nutrition on the trail? It seems like most trail food agrees with us, except for things like jerky and sausage. Nuts and beans sound like they'd be fine for protein. (EDIT: Found a thread about vegetarianism hiking [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trailmeals/comments/1byf2l/help_a_vegetarian/) still open to suggestions for such a long hike though!)

As the title states, I'm taking a week off work in late July or early August and I'd like to do a 5-6 day hike within a (relatively) short drive from my home in Richmond, VA.

I'm not exactly new to hiking or camping, but this will be my longest time out and I'll be using mostly new equipment. I don't have much experience with a heavy pack, but I am an active distance runner so I'm hoping to make good distance per day without missing anything by trying to hurry through. My friend coming with me isn't a runner, but he's in relatively good shape as well.

So what's a good little mini-section hike in NC/VA/MD that would be good in the hot summer months of July/August? Is the heat going to be absolutely unbearable, or will we be high enough up that it'll cool off a bit? What's a realistic number of miles to do?

I'd like to see a popular section of the trail, but we're definitely looking to be on our own for most of the trip (camping out rather than staying in shelters, for example).

Thanks in advance! I'll answer any followup questions if you have any.

I realize it's a little late and I don't plan to start at Springer Mountain, but I would like to hike NOBO to have the best chances of meeting people.

I need to find a place to store my car and possessions for 3-6 months. Everything I have fits in my car, so some storage unit in a town somewhere will probably work. I am looking for suggestions of cities or towns close to the AT or with transportation to the AT, far enough north that I can be amongst the hikers who started on-time.

I plan to hike a slower pace until I get my trail legs and meet hikers going a little faster than me. I figure this would give me the best opportunity of meeting a group of people interested in hiking at a slower pace and enjoying a relaxed hike.

The problem I'm having right now is building enough confidence that I can manage to get in my car and drive from California to Georgia or North Carolina. It seems really daunting right now, but since I'm not set on a thru-hike, it's a little easier to consider. I would like to be on the trail for a few months, and maybe complete it from my more northern starting location.

Obviously my four year old and I couldn't finish in a season; the plan would be to walk until she's not digging it and stay at her pace, and carry her in a front sling if I have the umph and she isn't feeling like walking.  She loves being outdoors, hiking, camping, etc. and we've done several long trips. I won't be concerned with making miles or forcing her to go. 

The question is mostly about tough elevation gains (can she handle it on her own going slow enough? Or are some parts so steep I'd HAVE to carry her?) and any personal experiences with little ones.

After eyeing the Appalachian Trail for a few months I've finally decided to hike a part of this trail in a time stretch of 4 to 5 weeks, starting around April 1st (A popular starting date it seems, so I might change this by a few days). I'm from The Netherlands, recently graduated from college and my father has quite some Airmiles left for me to spend on a plane ticket for this 'once in a lifetime' hike. I need your help on the following:

Where should I start? I would like to know which parts of the AT I should have seen, according to you. I have to combine the trail with a plane ticket, so Atlanta and Washington as starting point seem the most suitable in my position. I will return half way, so my start and finish will be the same place. Here's what I've thought of so far:

**Route A: Atlanta, NOBO** 

Springer Mountain (official starting point) &gt; Clingman's Dome, branching off to Gatlinburg to resupply. Returning to Springer Mountain after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+198 miles, in 40 days: 10 miles a day minimum.

**Route B: Washington, NOBO**

Harper's Ferry &gt; Port Clinton, branching off to Reading to resupply. Returning to Harper's Ferry after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+212 miles, in 40 days: 10,6 miles a day minimum.

**Route C: Washington, SOBO**

Harper's Ferry &gt; The Priest, branching off to Lexington or Glasgow to resupply. Returning to Harper's Ferry after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+191 miles, in 40 days: 9,5 miles a day minimum.

**Route D: New York, NOBO**

New York has an airport, but getting to the trail from there seems to be pretty difficult. Therefore; no specific route.

**Other info:**

- I am a relatively frequent runner, 22 years old, won't hesitate to go over the '10 mile per day minimum' if I feel I can do it. I can't really compare running to hiking, but I thought I should mention.
- Actual hiking experience is limited, having done a 2-day hike in the Italian mountains (2011) and a 10 day roadtrip to Scotland during which I've climbed the [Ben Nevis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nevis) (2012) and other smaller mountains.
- I would like to hike the most interesting/diverse trail, deciding between these four unless you know a better option.
- I've used [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/AppTrailMap.svg) and [this chart](http://www.summitpost.org/appalachian-trail-mileage-chart/593282) to calculate distances.

1362072385.0	19em0x	For Sale: Enlightened Equipment Prodigy Top Quilt	nraesmith	8	0	6	"I'm not sure if we're allowed to sell items here but here goes..

I have a ""like new"" condition Enlightened Equipment synthetic quilt 25* ""Prodigy"" edition.  I bought it thinking that a quilt would be better than a bag, but after trying it once on a cold night and realizing I'm a side sleeper (and in a tent not hammock), I opted to go for a full bag.  It's in perfect condition - only used once and stored properly in the meantime. 

It's a 5'6"" REGULAR and only weighs 31 ounces.  I am an average sized 5'7"" female and I fit inside it when it's cinched, granted it's snug.  It has 15D HB black nylon on inside and 15D WR (water resistant) green outside.  

They are selling for $220 new, and I am asking $175 including shipping.  I have paypal... I won't rip you off because I'm not a douchebag.  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/HlSwcLe.jpg) is a picture, and [here](http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/product/prodigy-20/) is the page of the website that talks about the quilt.

* What did you bring for first aid/emergencies?
* Any tips on other little things to bring or make? Anything that made your hike more pleasant, fun, or convenient. For instance I heard of people cutting off the bottom 3 inches of a milk jug to make a lightweight sink - I'm looking for tips like that. Bonus points if it is lightweight AND cheap. :)

* A bit random, but I'll include it here: I wear contact lenses. I expect this to be a pretty big pain in the ass no matter what (remembering to take them out at night, cleaning my hands, carrying the solution, mailing replacements to myself, making sure they dont freeze) so idk, if anyone has any tips, please share. 

* Anything small to bring for entertainment? I know this is not a priority concern, but I figured I'd ask. I was thinking I'd bring some dice. Let me know if you brought or saw something fun &amp; light to bring. 

Here's what I'm bringing in my first aid/emergency/misc kit. I would love to hear any feedback.

-pills: aleve, pepto, mucinex, laxative, claritin, benadryl, multivitamin (cut in half), glucosamine chondroitin, dose of cipro for emergencies (5oz total)

-blisters, cuts, scrapes: newskin, moleskin, dr scholls blister treatment, neosporin, a few gauze pads, hand sanitizer (4.8oz total)

-skin: gold bond, vaseline, sunscreen, insect repellent with deet, dr bronners, alcortin a packets (antifungal, antibacterial, anti inflammatory cream) (6oz total)

-misc: some emergen c packets, tweezers, needle, safety pin, compass, whistle, a few feet of duct tape, earplugs, pen (3.4 oz total)

1358113667.0	16ifi3	PHPT: Start walking up and down stairs NOW. Get those legs climbing!!	SnarkySnarkerson	7	0	1	"Previous Hiker Pro Tip: 


With only 90 days or less left before many of you head out for the adventure of a lifetime, if doable, you should get your body prepped for hills. They are coming. They are going to hit you quick. They are going to be hard. You are going to sweat more than you could ever imagine. Getting your body ready now will only relieve you of stress that takes it's toll while adapting to the new strength requirements you're asking your body to perform. 

If you can, get on a stair machine at a gym. This is as simple as it gets. Pick the number of stairs (or floors) you wish to reach and do them. Once you complete that goal, evaluate the intensity which you think it took to finish. Could you have done more? Maybe another 20, 40 steps? A few more floors?  Make that the next go around's goal. Repeat. After a few weeks, really start to push goals. Mountains are kinda big. Ups, sometimes, go on for miles.

No gym? That's cool, head on over to either your local high school's football field for the stadium steps, retaining wall steps of a dam, or any place where there may be a significant amount of steps to cut down on rests in between sets. In a pinch, a steep hill or path will work. Just like your mechanized brothern (or sistern) pick a number and do it. Push yourself. Complete, evaluate (be honest with yourself) and adjust for the next time.

This workout is going to help get your body prepared for the hills. Almost every hiker dreads ups. By having a little bit of conditioning done ahead of time, I believe, your transition to trail life will be quite a bit smoother than those who do not.


Bonus workout: If you are the employed sort, waiting these last few weeks away in a structure that has more than one floor, forgo the elevator. Every little bit counts.  If you're ""under-employed,"" that's cool. Find a large building and access the stairs next to the elevator. You don't have to work there (public building are best for this) to access them, silly fire codes. :)   Even better, those spaces are usually quasi-heated for your winter time workouts. 

Oh yeah, NO WEIGHTS! No pack, no ankle weights, no poles, none of it. You don't need that right now. This is for priming those climbing muscles.

GOOD LUCK!!

so first post here so take it easy on me.  I'm looking to make a Thru hike of the AT this year but i have some hurdles that i'm trying to overcome and i was hoping this community might be able to help.  First, i'm fairly young, 20 yrs old, and i'm still living with my parents and so convincing them to let me go would be the first step.  Next is that i don't have many friends who want to do nearly as much as i do if at all and even the ones who i might be able to sell on it have little to no experience backpacking.  Which leads me into my last problem, i am no stranger to the outdoors, hiking, camping, starting fires, leave no trace rules and the like. However, i have only been backpacking a few times and this would be a much larger trip then anything i have done before.  

So to sum things up:

* I am fairly young and need to sell my parents on the idea of me walking through the woods for 5 months.
* I can't find anyone to go with, especially no one with any experience backpacking
* I am fairly inexperienced myself, and although i don't think i'm biting off more then i can chew, i may be.

I'm a newbie to the Appalachian Trail, and was hoping to get some questions answered so I can finish up my planning for a sectional hike.

First, I plan to go from Boiling Springs PA to Harpers Ferry WV. From what I've looked up this is around 100 miles. Is this distance reasonable to do in a week? I have some experience with hiking, but the longest I've done is 14 miles in a day. Granted, this was a pretty mountainous hike in the Rio Grande National Forest, but I'm wondering if I should budget more time, or will taking more time just make me bored?

Second, how busy will the trail be? I plan to do the hike from June 15th to June 22nd. Will there be room available in shelters or should I expect to sleep on the ground at this time?

1373411453.0	1hyw29	A few questions about southern Maine for a book I'm writing.	Succubic_Unicorn	6	0	15	"Hi R/AppalachianTrail!

I'm so thrilled that this subreddit exists :D

As the title says I'm writing a book where the Appalachian trail happens to be featured pretty extensively, especially around the Monson area in Maine. My book is modern-fantasy noir, and for various reasons several of the characters converge at this particular trail village.

Here's a [link to my blog](http://proverbamodei.blogspot.com/) with chapters from the story. Chapter 13 and onwards is where Monson / Sebec Lake are the featured setting, though the trail near Lexington Virginia is mentioned in chapter 7.

My question for you folks is this - what is the trail like in this area? How is the weather? What is the general mood of the folks who live in the trail villages in Maine and New Hampshire? Do they treat hikers kindly (I've heard that they do). What is the flora and fauna like? How easy is it to get 'away from it all' and be surrounded by miles of woodland? Also - what's the nearest hospital to Monson that receives severe accidents? Is there one closer than Bangor?

Good luck to everyone hiking! The AT looks amazing, and I look forward to when I can afford to do some of it too :)

1373396530.0	1hyb7p	2014 Nobo Thru Starting in April - Initial Gear Questions	vtgorilla	8	1	8	"I intend to depart in early to mid April next year. I have basic backpacking gear and have been on a handful of weekend trips (solo or otherwise), but I’m still nailing down my initial thru gear list. I obviously don’t need all of this stuff for a long time, but I wanted to get an idea of what to look for in certain items so that I can get a good deal when one comes along.

**Cold weather clothing:**

* What are my alternatives to a down jacket? I’m allergic and I’d rather not submit myself to a potential problem unless it’s the only choice. Will a heavy-duty fleece be warm enough?

* I have a generic rain jacket now, but it’s significantly heavier/bulkier than the fancy ones. Does anyone have any good rain jacket suggestions that are fairly inexpensive but would improve my rain jacket situation?

* What is everyone’s take on long underwear? It sounds like pants are near universal, but tops are occasionally replaced by a warm long sleeve shirt.

**Pack:**

* Will a 60L provide plenty of space? I have a 44L now and was busting at the seams on my latest outing. I know I’m supposed to wait until I figure everything else out, but I don’t like guessing at what I should be looking for in the next 9ish months.

* Do most people go with a rain cover or a liner? I bought trash compactor bags to test out and they were too big of a hassle, but it could be because my current pack is so small.

**Multi-tool:**

* Suggestions for a handy, lightweight solution that won’t break the bank?

Thanks for all your help!

I’m a dude btw, if you’re making clothing suggestions.

2. Should I switch to leather hiking boots (LL Bean) or trail running shoes (Vasque)?  
3. Is 3-5 days the standard for going into town in order to resupply, and if so is it possible to still hike 20+ miles with a resupply?  
4. On that note, when you go into town do you usually take a shower and then laundry, and while the laundry is being done do some shopping and some R&amp;R? What is the typical procedure in town? Or do shops not care if you stink?  
5. Any towns out there in the south that are a hidden gem? So we all know about Neels Gap, Fontana, Franklin, Damascus, Hot Springs ...  
6. Have you seen thru-hikers hike in racing shorts (1-2"" inseam). Otherwise I'll just use my running shorts that have a slightly longer inseam, but still have a liner.

* Water Purificatrion- Sawer Squeeze vs. Aqua Mira? I've always been a fan of using a filter opposed to chemical treatments. Which would be a better option?

* Down Jacket- Yay of Nay? While hiking I'm usually pretty hot and always sweat a lot, the second I fall asleep I'm freezing my balls off. I plan on bringing my fleece jacket, will that be enough?

* Sleeping Pad- As I said before I sleep pretty cold, currently I plan on bringing a [Big Agnes Insulated Air Core 3/4 length] (https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Pad/InsulatedAirCore). I'm a side sleeper so the thicker pads really help me with getting a quality night sleep. Is there a better option out there? 

* Cooking- JetBoil Zip vs. Homemade Alcohol Stove? Obviously the weight is quite different; but other than that which would you suggest?

I think thats about all I can think of right now. I welcome your criticism and happy trails."	t5_2stbz	True

I am a born and raised basement dwelling nerd. I say I'm a non-hiker, which for the most part is true - I did a weeklong trip in high school (five years ago) down some of the AT in WV, and always enjoy weekending, but I cannot say that I'm a particularly seasoned trailblazer.

For the last couple months, I've had a wanderlust I can't seem to shake. I have fantasized about doing something like hiking the AT for a long time, and want to put the plan into action and do a thru-hike next year. Is this a ludicrous idea? Is it the kind of thing I can prepare for in the span of a year?

I've read the FAQ, and am nervous but not overwhelmed yet (should I be?). The thing I worry the most about it my fitness - I'm not overweight (6'0"", 185lbs), but I'm hardly muscular (&lt; 25th percentile in upper body strength for my age group, average most other places). What kind of shape do you recommend as a target? How should I get there?

Another thing is that I am a sports-induced asthmatic. When I did my weeklong trip in high school, I started off rough but was able to do the two 10+ mile days we ended up walking. Many inhalers exist now for athletic asthmatics, but I don't have one. Can anyone speak to this problem?

Also...about the internet and smartphones. I've heard some people are off-put by technology on the trail, which makes sense to me I guess. The basement dwelling nerd in me though wants to know things, though, and it seems to me like having a smartphone would be an awesome way to experience the trail. Is it possible to actually have a connection at all? How frowned upon is it, really?

Also, I am an ent of sorts, and would love to carry some trees with me. How much of a risk is that sort of thing?

In the spirit of (from what I've read and heard) a lot of thru-hikers, I'm doing as much planning as possible so it can all fall by the wayside when I actually get on the trail.

One thing that has caused me a bit of concern are the White Mountains, specifically the fact that I’ve heard they can fill up very fast. That, coupled with what I’ve been told about not being able to camp elsewhere, has caused me to ponder and come here to ask my question.

I don’t want to be going up and down hills all day only to find myself stuck with nowhere to camp when my destination is at capacity. It wouldn’t bother me so much if I could camp, but seeing as I’ve been told I can’t I’m a little concerned with marching up and down hills in the middle of the night.

What were your experiences in the Whites? Did you stay in all the Huts along the way? Did you sneakily camp? Did you get to your destination only to find you had to keep going in the hopes of having somewhere to stay at the next one?

I realize this is a pretty advanced problem to be contemplating considering I still have saving up and actually getting onto the trail to do, but I’m doing my best to make myself aware of (and develop possible solutions for) any problems I might run into.

In the next couple days I am going to be getting a pack and tent.  I have most of the other things needed from previous treks.  

I want to splurge on the pack I have tried the ""Osprey Atmos 65"" in an outfitter and it was the most comfortable pack I tried but it is a bit expensive.

Can anyone recommend if I should push through with the trail runners or stick with my VFF for my thru?

I know some people sleep cold and others warm, but I'd like to hear other's experience with bags in Georgia in March.

I was planning on taking a 15 degree bag and swapping for a 40 in the mid summer, possibly swapping back to the 15 near Maine. I saw some posters on WhiteBlaze, though, who said you shouldn't head out in March with anything above a 0 degree bag. What do you guys think about that?"	t5_2stbz	True

I spent 12 years in the Army and it wasn't an office type job so I have slept in nature in plenty of different situations. Hiking long distance is something I did a lot also. I grew up on a farm and lived in the woods when I was a kid. Long story short I can handle myself outdoors. She has plenty of car camping experience but not much more. We have the gear we are going to use and she has been training for longer hikes with more weight than we will use. She is in very good shape. Little experience staying out but she is stoked to get into it. We are getting married in August and will be spending 6 days in the Gatlinburg area. Only 2 of those are planned in a hotel. We also want to hit a few day hikes and outings between now and then. I have always dreamed of hiking the Appalachian and we both want to do a 3 day thru hike when we are close in August. One simple question is the car? Where would we park to link up and for shorter trips like this do people go so far out and turn around or do you arrange a ride back to your vehicle?

I hesitated to post this because the exact same problem is in many a thread on whiteblaze, but oh well.

I am at a complete standstill in choosing between the [Tarptent Notch](http://www.tarptent.com/notch.html) and [Big Agnes Copper Spur](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/copperspurul12012). I like these because they're relatively roomy (for 1 person) and double-walled. 


BA Pros/Cons:

* Larger width (1.07m)

* Will probably get more use out of it after the AT because I generally do not use trekking poles

* Has great reviews, lots of youtube videos (although BA is a bigger company, so that's to be expected)

* More expensive (~$350)

* Heavier (44oz)

TT Pros/Cons:

* Lighter (26 oz) because of the trekking pole setup (from everyone's advice I know poles are a necessity)

* Cheaper (though not by much once I consider seam sealing and shipping)

* Also has good reviews, but I think overall it's been less tested in the field? Again, TT is a small cottage company, so I guess this comes with the territory.

* I like the two doors/two accessible vestibule setup better than the 1 door BA, but the width is smaller (0.81m).

1350062044.0	11dgy3	Considering a 2013 NOBO thru with my GF - we have the ability now, should we do it? Is it too soon?	fieldsofgreen	5	1	8	"Hi there! So My GF and I have already been planning a move to North Carolina in the near future (possibly February). We plan on living with her Dad at his private airport, and working for him. There is tons of land, and time not spent working at the AP would be spent in the woods camping/hiking/testing out gear. We recently starting looking into the AT, and already we have fallen in love with it. The distance, the scenery, the discipline it would take...and on top of all that the awesome people we would meet along the way. We have decided this is absolutely something we want to do - and together. 

My worry is that we don't have enough time to plan, and we still have quite a bit of gear to acquire. We are very thrifty, and have already hit up things like REI garage sales and acquired some essentials for cheap. We also both need to save money, which is another problem...but I've already created a budget for myself that allows for saving, and plan to so the same to help my GF. We plan to be as frugal as possible on the trail, not going to bars or motels, and avoiding town/eating big/etc at all costs. We know it will be temping, but we are there to experience the trail, and lots of town stops are my necessary. 

Another thing - from journals I've read and others I've talked to, people who start slow and take it easy seem to be the ones that actually end up finishing. I have no problem starting a bit earlier so that we can take an extra week or two and go slower. We also don't plan on staying in towns for extended periods....2 days max in any town, and that would be rare. Any tips on going slower so you have a better chance of finishing?

I'm worried if we don't go this coming year, we never will because of obligations. How should we start planning? All we have decided is that we're going NOBO, starting sometime late March, and we really want to finish :). Please help us make this a reality!

I live in the VA region and have hiked bits of the AT between Damascus and Craig County.  I've probably logged about 50 total miles on the trail between parking and going to overlooks and more recently, a 25 mile hike from Whitetop to Damascus.  I have seen a bear on three different occasions and on the most recent one (during my 25 mile section hike) the bear actually ran at us, got about 30 feet away, stopped, and then ran the opposite direction.  Needless to say, my heart skipped a beat if not two. 


The first time was a few years ago in Craig County.  The bear saw us first and our attention was drawn to it as we saw his big bum bouncing down the hillside away from us.  The second time was on the way to Dragon's Tooth (near Salem, VA) and a baby cub crossed the trail right in front of us.  We turned and walked back to the car not knowing where momma-bear was.

I don't have a problem with the idea of hanging my food bag out and about as I've read about, but it just seems more convenient to have the canisters and keep all your stuff with you.

I would really prefer to leave in August, but I know I'll be missing the SOBO crowd.  I looked on the Whiteblaze.net Class of 2012 listing, and they noted 3 people leaving in early to Mid-August.


I guess what I'm wondering is how isolated will I be if I leave in August SOBO?  If I have to, I can try a Flip-Flop, but I won't really be connecting with people that much anyway since I'll be going slowly and they'll be seasoned at their point in the journey.  Also, my home is in Georgia, so I'd be hiking home to Thanksgiving if I started in August.  I don't plan on a fast pace at first since I only have only been on a few backpacking trips on the AT.


Also, are there any special concerns that I have to consider besides wearing Orange in October, black flies and ticks?

I'm going up to Vermont in the middle of July for a few days and have some to kill. This would be my first real overnight hike. I've camped on the AT and done day hikes, but nothing substantial before and after a camp. I'm 20 and in decent shape.

Is there a good section, milage, or must-see recommendation anyone has considering the above info. I'll be in the Manchester/Dorset area... 

Stratton Mt. looks like a good hike, but could I complete that in two days without back-tracking?

Though I'm sad to see him leave for the trail, he is also really excited and has been looking forward to it for years. 

I know that he is watching the weight of his pack, and that he will have some hiking companions to start out with, so I don't imagine he'll have a very rough time of it.  Mostly, I just want to know if there is anything that I can do or send with him.  My original thought was to send letters that he can open whenever he is feeling homesick or anything since they would be light and could fit in a ziplock baggie to stay safe. 

Keep in mind, he is the enthusiast here and except for some gaiters he is going to order, he pretty much has his pack set and ready.  Meanwhile, I feel like I'm reading another language looking at this subreddit!

He said it was ""mostly a camping tool"" and ""I also use it to store my food"".  My personal favorite has to be when a hiker told me (in Massachusettes, in late June) that if he didn't keep doing 20+ mile days he ""would never make it to Maine"".  He REALLY liked to talk about how he was ""rolling big miles"".  My friends and I all thought it was hysterical.

1359745577.0	17pjku	Reflection of Three Through Hikers	phishtaco	4	1	0	"Keystone was wearing a black winter hat, a non descript beanie, long pants, and trail sneakers. He had strong lower beard around the chin, you could not call it a neck beard because by comparison Johnny Walker took that title.  
Sleepwalker wore hiking boots and a long sleeve Under Armor shirt, his beard was dark brown, his hair short, curly, stood up with assistance form sweat and lack of showering. When he spoke his lower jaw projected and his bottom teeth were exposed rather than his upper teeth. He smiled, often. 
Johnny walker wore a silver plated chain necklace, the kind that stereotypical New Jersey guys wear. It looked cheap. He began in Pennsylvania and his beard began on the neck but stopped just below his cheeks, it was much thinner than the others. His mustache was thin and jaw line long yet strangely thin given his body type. Just by looking at his face you could tell that he had lost a significant amount of weight since being on the trail. He wore red trail running shoes and cargo pants. Of the four Johnny looked the least like a ‘hiker’, yet his enthusiasm for the trail surpassed all the others. 
Shake wore a hand crocheted hat, complete with earflaps and the AT logo. His beard met his lips and left no room for bare skin, so thick his face was hidden. Shorter and more talkative than the rest, he wore a long sleeve and pants. 
Keystone, has a tattoo on hi left hand between his thumb and pointer finger. A simple black mark in the shape of a keystone, Pennsylvania ‘The Keystone State.’  
Sleepwalker had a habit of walking late into the night, continuously reaching camp far past sunset.  Others would ask how he arrived so consistently past sunset. “ You just have to sleep walk sometimes,” He responded.
Johnny Walker started in Pennsylvania unlike the other three. On the waning night before starting the trail he drank heavily and received a name that friends gave to him. One must assume that there was a fair amount of whiskey involved in that night. 
Stash did not reveal the origin of his trail name. Other through hikers knew him for his hiking style, slow yet enjoyed every minute of it. He often said ‘if you finish last, you finish first.’ This was evident due to the number of towns and cities he had left the trail for in order to party, visit, or acquire stashes of pot, or so I hypothesized.
Most admitted that the trail was very hard and that even with only 600 miles left that they were never planning on hiking the trail again. Perhaps they will feel differently upon completion.
My night had begun as a random night with friends at the River Mill, which I abandoned due to a sour mood I had been in. Alex was bartending and the Floor Boards were crammed into the front corner of Gilles. I asked Sleepwalker and Keystone if they were through hikers, to my elation they were. I bought many beers because I was not able to offer my home as place to stay. Brain, from Newport had already offered a place to stay. He was happily drunk, a country fella who was confident in his driving abilities. PBR 24oz cans were accepted all around with smiles painted under their scraggly beards. An AT hiker will never turn down a beer. 
Stash remarked, “if you finish last you finish first.” Johnny Walker agreed. He had been hiking every day with Stash for last 400 miles. The two made a dynamic friendship that was apparent just moments after meeting the two. Keystone had only known the other three for a day, and Sleepwalker seemed to have hiked with the Johnny and Stash for a week and a half. He felt that their pace and use of car that Stash had acquired was slow, not the pace at which he wished to finish the trail.
Sleepwalker drank less than the others and was far more focused than the other three. They had all spent a week of zero days at Murtal beach with Stash’s friends. They drank, drove, and ended up in Blacksburg because of Brain. As the night carried on it became quite apparent that Sleepwalker was ready to detach from the group, he had enjoyed the change of pace and relaxation but was determined to finish the trail the same as he had started it, a sleepwalker.
The outside seating of Gilles provided a place for us to escape the loud crowded scene inside. All of the boys enjoyed the women of Blacksburg, Johnny walked for a while behind two girls up to the Lyric and came back after no success. 
As we walked to Brian’s truck, a group of sorority girls were selling brownies at the corner of Main Street. All of us 6 asked if they were ‘special’ to which there was no reply. We exchanged handshakes and well wishes. I never heard or saw the four hikers again but heir stories will live on.

Too late for NC?	madjackrogers	3	0	1	"So, in 2012 I did some sections of the AT (from Springer to the NOC, then from harper's ferry to Manchester Center, VT).  I'm thinking about going back out there this summer for more (It's my summer after my first year of medical school, so basically my last summer off).  My problem is that I don't get out of school until May 15th, so I'm not sure if going north from the NOC is possible.

I was in PA and NY during May of last year, but I was still hiking through some pretty severe heat.  I was just wondering if that was going to be unbearable down south.  I thought the mountains might cool it off some.  Keep in mind, I don't think i'll be able to finish, but if I do i'll be skipping from harper's ferry to vermont.

I'll be starting with a friend of many years and my long-term GF. Me and my friend aren't going to try to stick together no matter what, but we've sectioned at the same pace in the past. GF isn't quite as strong a hiker as me, but if I spot her a few pounds and take it a little easier she can keep pace. She'll probably drop if I do but I'm set on hiking with or without her- given the drop out rate, it'd be pointless to do otherwise I think.

At any rate, I'm looking for specific recommendations on some gear I either haven't bought yet or have some doubts about, for both me and  her. I'm on a budget, not hugely tight, but I am taking a few extra pounds over spending a lot on gear. 

HEADLAMPS (Both): I like the look of the black [diamond gizmo](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/lighting/gizmo-headlamp/), with lithium batteries to save a little weight. 

POLES (Me): I'm 5'10, and I think [Black Diamond Trail Back](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/trekking-poles/trail-back-trekking-pole/) poles seem as good as any for a midrange price. 

SLEEPING PAD (Me): The thermarest z-lite is wonderfully light and simple, not to mention very popular from what I've seen, but frankly I can't sleep well on it. My main question here is, can I get away with an uninsulated air mattress like [this](http://www.exped.com/exped/web/exped_homepage_na.nsf), or will I freeze in the smokies if I don't get an insulated one?

SLEEPING BAG (Her): She still needs a bag. She's 5'5"" and a fairly cold sleeper. Can she get away with a [Kelty Cosmic Down 20](http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Cosmic-20-Degree-Sleeping-Regular/dp/B005F5EPAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357877832&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cosmic+down)? Or does she need something warmer? We'll be sharing a 2-person tent and I'll probably throw my down jacket  over her bag to help a little. At the moment I'm thinking to get it, and bring a liner as cheap, light insurance against a cold snap. 

FOOD BAG (Both): I think the large [Outdoor products bag from this set](http://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Products-3-Pack-Ultimate-Sack/dp/B001AZNATC) will serve as a food bag. It's maybe 9 liters. Any recommendations for or against? There are reviews but none I could find specifically by long distance hikers. 

GROUNDCLOTH (Both): We've got a [Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/FlyCreekUL2). We've used it with an existing ground mat I've had, I think it's PVC. Are there any real gains to be made by switching to a tyvek sheet or something? Can I go without? I've had the fortune to never be tenting in a serious rain so I don't really know.

RAIN GEAR (Both): We have some crappy ponchos but I have serious doubts about their efficacy when it's 33 degrees and raining. I think they're fine for more moderate weather, and for summer we've simply done without. I like the looks of the frogg toggs DriDucks series, either the [DuraLite 3](http://www.froggtoggs.com/store/outerwear-rainwear/suits/driducks/dri-ducks-dura-lite-15.html) or the [Ultralight 2](http://www.amazon.com/frogg-toggs-Ultra-light-Suit/dp/B007X5XB2Y). I know they won't be that durable, but they only need to last maybe two months down south then another month towards the end- we'll use the lighter ponchos or even nothing in the middle.

PACK COVER (Me): I've got a rather unusual pack with a 40 year old, external frame pack. It is about 8 ounces heaver (after some modifications) than a comparable, modern internal frame, but I'm keeping it because of budgeting, the fact that I've hiked a few hundred miles in in with no issues, and the ventilation. Any reason not to just use a heavy duty trash bag? 

Thanks for any help!

Unfortunately, I don't know where to go for a test run. I'd like a good 100 mile stretch that would be indicative of typical thru hike experiences and logistical hurdles. This should probably include mundane stuff like grocery shopping and organizing the logistics of a drop box (kick box?).

1349885616.0	119a53	Question for Women Hikers/Backpackers...	kigolebitties	4	1	2	"I recently committed to hiking a section of the AT next spring/summer and I'm wondering if any ladies have any recommendations about the right bra to wear. Not wearing one is not an option.

I am an active trail/road runner and I have a couple of awesome Champion/Nike sports bras but the sweat accumulated in between my boobs combined with...dirt(?) makes me break out when wearing my sports bra for longer than an hour. 

I really only considered wearing a sports bra because the idea of hiking for 8+ hours with no support scares me but I'm open if anyone has any recommendations.

1348709528.0	10jgcb	Planning on beginning a NoBo thru-hike on January 1st. Any advice/concerns/stories?	joneill1	3	0	13	"While I do have a bit of winter hiking experience, I'd love to hear what anyone's opinion is!

Context:
Began saving up and getting back into shape for the past couple months. I plan on graduating in December, then trying to complete a long time dream of a AT thru-hike! However, I do have a commitment starting up in late July, and I'd like to have some down time before starting back up with the real world. I know hiking will be slow during this time of year, so I'm trying to plan accordingly.

Just as a note, I try to get in at least a day-hike every weekend, and have completed multiple 50+ hikes, both warm and cold-ish (December) weather, in the past. I know that nothing I do will completely prepare me for the hike, but I'm not going to take it lightly either. Any suggestions on training?"	t5_2stbz	True

1340383886.0	vfxog	Questions for a GA hike	ChefDell	3	0	11	Yesterday, having the day off work, I went and hiked about 9 miles of GA AT and loved every minute of it. I hadnt hiked seriously since boy scouts but now really want to get back into it. Before college starts back in mid August, I am really considering hiking the 80 miles of GA AT. The problem is I have no real idea of how long it will take me, which shelters to stop at, or what to bring/expect. I have some rather out dated gear (a heavy sleeping, 2 person tent, and a large pad) and was wondering if there were alternatives. I also have a hennesey hammock and thought that that I could use that and only bring a blanket or 2. Any suggestions?	t5_2stbz	True

1336522505.0	tdtlp	Looking for some help on planning a leisure section hike	PurpPinnochio	3	0	7	Me and three or four of my friends, all experienced backpackers/campers are looking to do a nice section hike in early June. I've done several sixty mile section hikes myself, but for them it's their first time on the trail. I'm not worried about any problems, we all have good gear and experience, I'm moreso interested in suggestions for sections to do at this time of the year. We were planning on at least 60 miles and to be gone for about a week. Both those numbers are subject to change, but that's a pretty good estimate for what we're planning. So, I'd love some suggestions and thanks.	t5_2stbz	True
1335382231.0	ss8lq	SO is hiking the Appalachian Trail.  What can I do for him?	Punchcatpunchesshit	3	0	1	"I already posted in /r/AskReddit but, because of some potential experience here, I feel like you guys would be able to help more.

My boyfriend began hiking NoBo from Georgia yesterday.  We set up dates and places for me to send care packages, and we already planned on creating a montage when he was done.  

*First the care-packages
    We set it up so I will be including socks, earplugs, certain maps, etc.  Is there anything besides notes and such that I can include to help him stay motivated, sane and happy?  Something to show him I'm thinking of him and that I miss him?  

*The Montage
    We took a trip to visit his family is WA state for the week before he started.  Our flights split in Chicago.  What we decided to do is take pictures of our feet everyday until he's back to show where they have taken us.  Our first picture is of both of ours together in the airport in Chicago.  This is good for him because it will show the ware and tear on his shoes, his feet growing from walking everyday,  the multiple pairs of shoes he'll be going through etc.  

I want to do something incredible for him, something to keep him smiling through out the trail.  He'll be coming through our home state July/August so maybe I can do something for him then besides meeting up with him and hiking part of the trail?  Oh and his birthday is in May and our anniversary is in June.

Any ideas, opinions, etc. are welcomed."	t5_2stbz	True
1335285988.0	sq6fg	SNP summer section hike: What to expect as far as thru-hiker crowds?	ganley	3	0	4	"The SNP web site warns against section- or day-hiking the AT there in June, due to crowding from thru-hikers. I was planning to do a week in that section at the end of June. First, are there really enough thru-hikers to create crowds? Second, what does the thru-hiker schedule typically look like in detail? I was sure I would find on the web somewhere a chart of how many thru-hikers are typically where and when, but I don't see such a thing.

Bottom line: I'm inclined to just hike my hike and not worry about this warning, but figured I'd see if anyone had any advice on the matter."	t5_2stbz	True
