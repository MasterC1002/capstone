Original content:
EVO has been given a cease and desist to not stream Melee on their official or unofficial streams.   
http://shoryuken.com/2013/07/09/changes-to-evo-2013-smash-schedule/

From the Melee It On Me facebook page:  
""Nintendo's Legal department sent a cease and desist to EVO Tournament Series over the streaming of Smash Bros. Melee. If you want to appeal to Nintendo, please not only tweet them at @NintendoAmerica (https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica )  
###Hashtag MeleeStream4EVO##


, but you can use these to email Nintendo as well:

http://www.nintendo.com/corp/prcontact.jsp
http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/webform/

It is IMPORTANT that you not resort to insults or negative stuff, instead emphasize that the community exists and our community's efforts to raise $94,685 for Breast Cancer Research. Insults WILL ONLY MAKE THIS WORSE.""

MAKE SURE to express how you are no longer thinking of purchasing their products or a Wii-U if they only care about promoting their new products and want to extinguish loyal fans who love their past works.

Please help contribute to this emergency rally so we can get Melee back on stream(even if not streamed by EVO, by the smashers!)  
Please upvote this to keep it visible until EVO happens this weekend.  
And we need to reach a larger audience! /r/smashbros is small.

Thanks to your feedback we will be moving forward with some additional changes to the subreddit. Let's cut to the chase:

* **Link Flair has been enabled.** There is no longer a need to put tags such as [Melee], [SSB4], etc. directly into your submission titles. After submitting, click the ""flair"" button under the text box and manually apply the appropriate label. If you feel any important labels are missing, let me know.

* **MEMES are officially banned from /r/smashbros.** I have created a new subreddit called /r/smashmemes where pretty much anything goes as long as it isn't completely and obviously irrelevant or inappropriate. ""Memes"" include [image macros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro), rage comics, and other irrelevant garbage. This is **not** a ban on images. Fan art, [in-game snapshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/15foar/if_bowser_wins_in_the_2p_slot_sometimes_his_face/), [animated gifs](http://i.imgur.com/xhAw3Wv.gif), [community highlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/16n216/mew2king_has_the_best_reaction_after_beating/), news in the form of pictures (such as website updates), and otherwise [GENUINELY unique/funny/interesting content](http://i.imgur.com/HyeWHDc.png) will still be allowed on the main subreddit. Use good judgment!

* **/r/smashmemes** has been created for those of you who want this sort of content. Yes, I just posted this twice in a row. I want to make sure nobody misses it. You can view both simultaneously using: http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros+smashmemes

* The flair icon for **Lucas** is now functional, in addition to **Megaman, Villager, and Wii Fit Trainer.** (thanks to /u/Ike_Lawliet)


* **There is a pending ban on Brawl vs. Melee (vs. 64) posts.** I say it is pending because we will be creating a FAQ for it. When the FAQ is written, the ban will go into effect.

* **SSB4 wishlist types of posts are now banned.** Instead, if there is demand for it, we will occasionally (maybe once a month or so) post an ""official SSB4 discussion thread."" The purpose of this is to avoid several of these posts popping up per day. All official discussion threads will be archived for future viewing.


/r/smashbros is also looking to better take advantage of the reddit wiki system. Articles that I'd like to have include but are not limited to:

* Beginner's guide to competitive Smash / general /r/smashbros FAQ
* How do I find local players/tournaments? FAQ
* Past AMAs
* Project M FAQ
* Melee / 64 online play guide
* Melee vs. Brawl

Obviously, some of this can just be pulled from Smashboards and other resources. Any suggestions for useful content are welcome. If you'd like to volunteer to help out, shoot me a PM.

I was worried about how Melee would be perceived by the rest of the Fighting Game Community at EVO but you were SO GOOD. I know there were some Smashers that were hating on James Chen's commentary but I thought you guys were excellent together. James Chen has been doing this seriously for years and you were every bit as competent as he was, frequently making clever jokes (recommended daily servings of turnips/greens, playing lowercase, etc.), never letting the commentary get stale, and your sign-off was so humble and respectful.

I tuned into the Marvel stream by accident and some of the commentators had found your Smash notebook left at the desk, and they were admiring the amount of detail and work you'd put into it (writing down the tournament achievements of each player, coming up with metaphors for them that the FGC community could relate to - whether you were comparing them to Street Fighter players or Basketball teams, etc). I had no idea you put that much work into your commentary, and it was great to see the culmination of your efforts displayed so well in the Top 8, when we had over 120,000 people watching.

So cheers to prog; if Smash is invited back for EVO 2014, it will be, in no small part, thanks to you."	t5_2qiep	True

1371663103.0	1go1bs	Introducing SakuraiBot! Posting Miiverse Sakurai posts and screenshots to this subreddit.	Wiwiweb	165	13	21	"Hi all!

I made this guy. He checks Miiverse every 5 minutes using my personal account, and posts it here if new, including the accompanying text, and even videos if Sakurai decides to post more.

The goal for me was getting started with Python (Never touched before). It took me 2 days, and I'm pretty satisfied with the results.

Annoyingly, a few things happened while I was working on it:

* Sakurai keeps postings uninteresting pictures, and only saying ""Pic of the Day.""
* As /u/Probable_Foreigner mentioned a few times, the pictures also get posted on the main website, and they are even ~50 pixels bigger.

I'm gonna keep the bot running, hoping that someday, we'll see something big. If a particular picture of the day turns out to be a useless picture, like something we have seen before, feel free to not upvote it. But the bot will be there when they show the tail of Mewtwo by mistake ([Remember how we discovered Lucario ;\)](http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Lucario_confirmed_for_Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl) ).

I'm gonna try to improve the bot by grabbing the bigger pictures from the website and posting them to imgur for archive.

Finally, [the source is available on Github](https://github.com/Wiwiweb/SakuraiBot) for you nerds.

Cheers.




Edit:  
Ok the smashbros website pictures should be used now.  
However, I'm not sure how fast those are updated. If the Miiverse posts gets updated faster than the smashbros site, then when the bot grabs the image on the website, it will be the wrong one.  
For the moment, I will keep the original Miiverse link as the main link, and put the smashbros image in the comments."	t5_2qiep	True

1371150820.0	1gac46	[ModPost] Welcome to /r/smashbros! Let's discuss the state of the subreddit.	Elbedhar	164	11	81	"**Please upvote this for visibility**

Hey, /r/smashbros! First off, I'd like to welcome all of our new subscribers to the subreddit. In the past couple days we have gained nearly 2000 subscribers. That's just incredible! I expect this number to continue to rapidly grow as we continue to hear more information about Smash 4.

That said, /r/smashbros veterans have noticed a change in the atmosphere around here. This past week we've seen an exponential increase in the number of image posts, memes, and various other types of submissions that I'll simply refer to as ""reddit nonsense."" The moderating team is committed to maintaining /r/smashbros as a top-quality subreddit for both casual and tournament players alike, and in order to facilitate this we've introduced some new submission rules. Here are the highlights:

* **Images of text are disallowed.** Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any submission that appears to be an obvious attempt at so-called ""karma whoring."" You know what we're talking about. If your submission can be adequately presented as a text post (possibly with links to some images), that's the way to go.

* **Do not post duplicate submissions.** We will be seeing frequent updates from the official website, among other sources. Please check thoroughly to see if someone has already shared the content before sharing it yourself.

* **Please remember to tag your submissions.** ~~We are going to be streamlining this by making the tags more compact. From now on, the appropriate tags to use are [64], [M], [B], [PM], and [SSB4]. Until there's more of a clear distinction between the 3DS and Wii U iterations of Smash 4, we'll use the same tag for both. Of course, tags are not necessary for general submissions. For submissions pertaining to more than one game, use combined tags such as [B/M] or simply [All].~~ I've just added proper ""Link Flair"" to the subreddit. Please use this! More info to come in a post tomorrow.

/u/el-prog has been added to the moderating team to help us enforce these new rules. Additionally, here are some **tentative rules** that we are considering enacting, but have not done so yet:

* **Disallowing Brawl vs. Melee posts.** This debate has been done to death and we think that an objective wiki FAQ page can substitute. Anyone want to take a stab at making this? Let me know.

* **Disallowing ""I want to see X make it into Smash 4!"" types of posts.** We get it, everyone wants their favorite characters to be in Smash 4. There's probably an average of 1 of these submissions per day and they add unnecessary clutter to the subreddit without generating any actual discussion.

* **Disallowing meme / funny image posts.** Memes used to be pretty uncommon around here and they provided a good occasional laugh. Now we're seeing multiple villager meme posts per day and they are detracting from the quality of the subreddit.


Again, **these are not currently in effect**, and we welcome any feedback. We're also open to any suggestions in general.


Lastly, thanks to /u/Ike_Lawliet, we have flair icons for the SSB4 newcomers. We will be adding these (as well as Lucas, who is apparently missing), but unfortunately there are some glitches we're trying to work around. Please bear with us - the flair icons will be available soon.


Thanks guys, and happy smashing!

First and foremost, welcome! We are SO glad to have you, I cannot stress enough, that everyone who expresses interest in playing any of the Smash Brothers games at a competitive level, should definitely pursue  that. There's a reason many of us have dedicated years and years of our lives to it, and I'm sure you'll see that same dedication very soon!

Anyway, I digress. I'm going to try my best to break this up into a broader topics, for better comprehension! Let's get started!

**Pre-First Tournament**

So before you become the next Mango or Armada, you're going to have to start going to local tournaments. So the obvious question is, ""How do I get ready for my first tournament?"" Well, here a few things that I think most people would consider to be VERY important!

1) At almost any tournament you ever go to, you will only ever see CRT (Cathode ray tube) tvs being you. HDTV's will always lag with melee, and it makes it nearly unplayable at higher levels of play. So if you're not practicing on a CRT tv, that's something you should definitely invest in. You can usually pick them up for less than $20 at Goodwill, or whatever thrift store is close to you.

2) The only really quality controller on the market is the original first party gamecube controller. I know your MadCatz™ controller has a super sick turbo button, but I can promise you, it's not going to be nearly as fluid or responsive as the original!

Now that we've got those things out of the way, lets go into some real  tournament prep!

3) Find a scene near you! There is a facebook page for every region of smash! No matter where you are. In the sidebar of this subreddit there is a list of every regional facebook group. Go join the one appropriate to you, and find out when the next tournament in your area is. More importantly, however... Make friends! I think we can all agree the best part of melee is the amazing friendships (and in some cases, rivalries) that we have developed over the years. This is an insanely close community, and a pleasure to be a part of!

4) Pick a character! If you haven't already, it's important to have a main to work on. If you focus on one character you'll likely improve faster than trying to work on 5-6 at the same time!

5) Know what to expect! Watch youtube videos, streams, read guides, everything you can do to know what to expect when you show up. More than likely, there's going to be a couple really high level players in your area. Learn who they are. It's going to be important to watch their matches, and learn how they play. 

6) Practice, practice, practice! The best way to get good at melee is to play a lot! When I say a lot, I mean A LOT. Like, a literal disgusting amount. When you think it's time to take a break, play for another hour. You want to be the best right?! Well, put in the work!

**Your First Tournament**

You're here now. This is it. Time to show everyone how all that awesome training is coming along! Hell, maybe you even know some advanced techniques like wavedashing or l-canceling, and you're ready to really stick it to some people!

1) You're going to get bodied. I'm sorry. I have so much faith in you, and I promise I'm going to be cheering for you! I really am! But you're going to get run over by really good players, and it's going to suck.

2) It doesn't suck! Ask them what's going on! Most people are going to be more than happy to give you tips, and suggestions based on how you played. The most important thing you can ever do is ASK QUESTIONS. Don't just lose, and get upset that you're not as good as you thought you were, it's so very important that you take your loses with a grain of salt, and try to improve! 

3) Stay for the whole tournament! I've seen a few times that new players will show up, get knocked out in pools, get discouraged and want to leave early. DON'T DO THAT! Smash tournaments are so much fun, and so hype, I can't imagine ever leaving early! Watch late bracket, and be amazed at how good these players are! Watch what they're doing, and how they're handling themselves in pressure situations. It's possible (and likely, if you stick with it!) that that's going to be you someday, so pay attention!

4) If at all possible, try to get a match or two of yourself recorded/streamed, and then uploaded! Sometimes as a newer player this is difficult, but if you see a recording setup, and it doesn't seemed to be used, just ask! It'll be important later, I promise.

5) The most important thing. HAVE FUN! Of course you're here to compete, and you want to win, but the best thing you can possibly do is have fun! Talk to new people, play friendlies (when it's allowed!), go get dinner with new people you just met! I can't stress enough how the best part about melee is the tight-knit community. 

**Post-First Tournament**

Well, that was awesome! The tournament was so much fun, you didn't do as great as you would've hoped, but that's okay! You had a blast, made some new friends, and are ready to get better and go back with some new tricks. Now what can you do to prepare for the NEXT tournament, now that you know what's up?

1) Remember those questions that you asked? Ya, the ones up in point 2? LISTEN TO THEM. Most likely you asked strong players, and they gave sound advice. That only matters if you listen to the advice! Someone told you to stop jumping so much, and try to play a more grounded game? Do it. I know it's tempting to jump, but these are habits you've gotta break early! 

2) Hopefully you can get some matches recorded/uploaded, and now it's time to watch them. It's going to be painful. When you watch matches retroactively you're going to see a lot of mistakes you made, and they're going to look really clear to you now. That's a good thing! Try to very consciously determine what the biggest mistakes you're currently making are. Next time you play, think about them a lot. Try to just get rid of one bad aspect of your play at a time. Melee is a game of winning a lot of small battles with yourself, over a long period of time. 

3) Keep practicing! Like I said before. The best way to improve is to play a lot! So don't stop!

**Other Stuff!**

Remember, Melee is a pretty difficult game, with an immense skill cap. You're not going to get great overnight. Sometimes it's going to be very frustrating. It's important that you know that there is a **huge** community of players here that have gone through/will go through what you are! Don't ever be afraid to ask questions, or to just talk to someone, if you ever feel discouraged, or like quitting!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, hopefully it's kind of helpful for some of you new players who have recently taken an interest in this game! I hope to see you all at some tournaments in the future!

Melee It On Me did a nice segment on the subject, which can be found [here.](http://www.twitch.tv/meleeitonme/b/438959871?t=70m19s)    
    
    
## Intro  
*****    
    
The Wii U is an HD console. This means the competitive SSB4 scene will be migrating toward HD monitors, much like the FGC has. This brings forth a new problem: input lag. Every HD display in existence has input lag. This includes both PC monitors and TVs.    
    

**Q:** *What is input lag? How will it affect SSB4?*  
  
**A:** Input lag is the delay between a button press and the intended action happening on screen. Most of us have experienced it at some point while gaming at a friend's house; you fire up a FPS/platformer/rhythm game, and for some reason, your timings are completely off and you can't figure out why.    
    
Input lag is why games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band have calibration tools for HDTVs. Since these games are timing-sensitive, input lag becomes extremely noticeable, so adjustments are often required to make these games playable. Fighting games are also very timing-sensitive, so fighting game enthusiasts play on PC monitors that have low input lag (more on that later).    
    
All HDTVs and HD monitors have input lag. The level of input lag varies depending on the make and model of the display. Some PC monitors have less than a frame (16ms) of lag, while many HDTVs have more than 3-5 frames (50 - 80 ms) of lag.    
    
Generally speaking, 0ms to 16ms of input lag is unnoticeable, 16ms to 32ms is noticeable but still playable, and more than 32ms is disruptive to a gaming experience.    
    
**Q:** *I've played on a lot of HDTVs and none of them had input lag. Are you sure you're not full of shit?*  
  
**A:** Some gamers are more sensitive to lag than others. You simply didn't notice it, or you happened to play on TVs that had low input lag.    
    
    
**Q:** *How can I test whether my TV is laggy using only my Wii U?*  
  
**A:** Follow the guidelines [here.](http://www.nintendolife.com/forums/wii-u/use_the_gamepad_to_test_your_hdtv_lag)    
    
    
In short, the Wii U gamepad has one or two frames of input lag (between 16ms and 32ms). Using a countdown timer, you can determine which display has less lag - the TV or the gamepad. In my case, my monitor is actually quicker to display visuals than my Wii U gamepad.    
    
    
## Monitors with low input lag  
*****        
    
    
There are a few databases for monitors and TVs with low input lag.    
    
[Shoryuken's Sub 1 frame HDTV/monitor input lag database](http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/145141/sub-1-frame-hdtv-monitor-input-lag-database) (a few years old, but you can check the most recent posts for updates on newer monitors)    
    
[displaylag.com](http://www.displaylag.com/) (the most up-to-date database, contains a lot of useful information on display lag)    
    
The monitors used by Evo and MLG (the Asus VH236H and the BenQ GL2450HM, respectively) are considered the most surefire bets when selecting a gaming monitor. Their input lag is low enough to be considered tournament-viable (both have around 10ms) and both monitors are relatively cheap. Some monitors have even less input lag than these two, but they will cost a lot more (for example, the Eizo Foris FS2333, which costs around $500).    
    
If you're looking to enter tournaments in the future, it's recommended that you use either the Evo or MLG standard, as these will most likely be used in tournament play.    
    
    
## Other questions  
*****        
    
    
**Q:** *Can I still use a CRT for SBB4?*  
  
**A:** Yes, you can. However, the image quality of the Wii U is very blurry on a CRT, so while you may have minimal input lag, you won't get to appreciate the game's nice graphics. Also, your friends will probably hate you.    
    
**Q:** *My TV has a game mode. Will this eliminate input lag?*  
  
**A:** Not really. Game mode disables some post-processing effects that cause input lag, but the improvement is usually minor. You should always have this feature enabled.    
    
**Q:** *I play Smash casually. Will I have to buy a new TV?*  
  
**A:** Probably not. This mostly affects those who plan to enter competitive SSB4 tournaments. Most casual gamers have nothing to worry about.    
    
**Q:** *I have an HD CRT display. Will this have input lag?*  
  
**A:** Probably. HD CRT TVs use a lot of post-processing effects to heighten the image quality.    
    
**Q:** *Almost all the monitors I see on Newegg and Amazon have 2ms or 5ms response time. What's up with that?*  
  
**A:** [Response time has nothing to do with input lag.](http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/55593/the-new-definitive-hdtv-lag-faq)    
    
**Q:** *Can I play SNES/N64/GameCube/Wii games on a monitor with low input lag?*  
  
**A:** Using an HDTV or HD monitor with these consoles will add significant input lag. This is because the consoles' native resolution is standard definition, whereas the HDTV is in 720p or 1080p, creating a need for upscaling. It's recommended that you play old school consoles on CRTs and newer HD consoles on HDTVs or HD monitors.    
    
    
  
  
And that's it. If you have questions, feel free to ask. Also, keep in mind that buying a monitor or TV with low input lag will improve your gaming experience with all games and HD consoles, not just with SSB4.

**EVO was a blast to watch, and it made me realize, even as a casual player, how much we need to get Sakurai and Nintendo's attention to influence Smash 4. We know after EVO, we have the numbers to make a difference, we know the gaming industry listens if the outcry is loud enough, and we know reddit has done awesome things before, so let's make a difference!**


Also, be nice about it.


[This link has everything you would need to contact Nintendo.](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1iavgm/make_sure_you_let_nintendo_know_how_happy_you/) I already did my part.

Here's my story, and why I've gotten so excited about this whole deal. I'm a casual smash player, and a casual basketball player (I only say this because I'm making some comparisons here) First off, I've played smash since the N64 version, I'm pretty good for a casual, but I can't hang with the competitive scene. I know because I've played with some of them. When Brawl came out, I played it, and I enjoyed it, and I like it more than melee, so I sided with Brawl on the SSBM vs. SSBB argument, mostly because of my dislike of the attitude of the competitive players, and misunderstanding of the mechanics. I came on /r/smashbros from time to time and saw videos of Armada and M2K and whatnot, but like any pro athlete who's the best at what they do, they make it look easy. I didn't get what was going on, and I was always thinking, ""Why couldn't you get really good at Brawl, tripping aside,"" and I didn't think it was that important how SSB4 turned out if tripping was removed. 

After watching EVO, **I GET IT**. When I looked at the competitive players who weren't like Mango or PPMD, and everything didn't look so easy, I could tell what was going on, what mechanics were being used, and just how hard it was to get to the level the people being knocked out in the first few rounds were at. The nuances of M2K, Armada, and Mango were visible.  Also EVO was EXCITING. I like watching pro basketball, and in my mind, watching anyone get a Dair spike off the edge with Falco was like watching anyone in basketball sink a corner 3 pointer to pull a lead. Watching Wobbles do a wobble, with the grab, the wobble and then the KO, was like Watching LeBron get a steal, fast break to the basket, and do a flashy dunk. They both had the initial huge jolt of excitement, a moment of inevitability peppered with the possibility of a screw-up, then an emphatic exclamation.  Once I realized the level these people were playing at (no small thanks to Prog) these matches were intensely exciting.

I'll follow up these comparisons by saying that I neither have any desire to become a pro smash player or a pro basketball player, but I enjoy watching both. I don't know how to dunk or wobble, and I'll probably never do either, but they are both part of what makes each game exciting. The same goes for wave-dashing, canceling, teching, etc. After EVO, I watched a few games of competitive Brawl because I thought it would be better, but instead, after understanding melee through EVO, I realized what Sakurai did to Brawl is what would happen if the commissioner of the NBA made all pro basketball players wear socks and no shoes when they were playing on hardcourt. It would be slowed down, advance movement would be impossible, and of course, there would be lots of tripping. It's just flat out less exciting to watch.  

Now this has made me realize that I enjoy watching melee with the extreme high level of play, and that I want to see much more of the same. This is where SSB4 comes in. Sakurai and Nintendo hold a unique opportunity in their hands, and they don't even realize it. They have a massive legacy behind them for having THE BEST EVER game for both casuals and elites. They have already screwed up once in extending this legacy of catering to both parties, but now they have another chance. But they think they have to choose. As you guys have been saying, they don't realize they don't have to choose between the two player groups. But I know, and we all know that the game needs advanced techniques. Just like in basketball, you have casuals everywhere who can't dunk, can't shoot a corner 3 pointer 50% of the time, but they can still dick around and play horse, knock-out, etc. with the same ball and hoop, or just play a less intense serious game.  But these techniques are still in the game, and make it much more exciting for those who watch.  The same goes for smash. You can dick around and put pokeballs on high and go to town if you are casual, and you can have a low level competitive match, just because of the way the game already is. But if you have advanced mechanics in there, this does not effect the casual players one bit. 

We need to make Sakurai realize this. We need to be loud. We have already been trying, but now we have new proof that the competitive community should be listened to.

EVO has brought something new to the table though. It has hopefully made Nintendo realize that people do want to watch competitive smash, and that this group is by no means small at all.  But unless we continue making noise, nothing will happen. We also have to have a unified message. We already know we want advanced techniques, but we should also ask for leaderboards, patches to fix unbalances in characters, really, really good online play (if it's possible) and an easy way to stream smash games a bit like LoL.  I think that these five things would make SSB4 into an enormous community and build upon the amazing base of a community that melee has given us (Personally I think with these things that we could get up to a fraction the size of the LoL community if Nintendo does this for us).

If we want the dream of smash being a huge competitive community that is enjoyable to be a part of and to watch by both competitves and casuals, we have to reach out to Nintendo and Sakurai, and tell them what we want. The link at the top of the page has Nintendo's contact info.

P.S. 

If you think this post is inspiring, or correct in what we need, please give some feedback and I might make a very abridged version for /r/gaming. Because I know we'll need their size and exposure to get anywhere. Also, SSB4 still needs to add characters and stages to keep the casuals, including me, happy (that's all it takes) but I didn't want to put that anywhere in there because it broke the flow.

And yes, I am aware that Pichu is the worst character in the game. He is fundamentally flawed: half his moves cause damage to himself (which adds up fast), his attack range is piss-poor, and his primary recovery (up-b) *does 4% damage every time you use it.* The list goes on and on and on. That said, many people choose to play him as a troll character, myself included. At first, I didn't take Pichu seriously at all. I won only a handful of matches, but the sense of sheer satisfaction I got when beating another player as Pichu was incredible. I suddenly wanted to prove to the world that Pichu can exceed everyone's expectations and promptly shit on the tier list.

For the last few months, I've been playing exclusively Pichu, and I've developed a solid understanding of the character. I don't consider myself a pro by any means -- take this post as more of a beginner's guide to Pichu. With these tips under your belt, you too can destroy your opponents with ""the worst character"".

Let's get started.

**GENERAL CHARACTER NOTES**

* For the love of God, USE NAIR

* As mentioned before, Pichu's electrical attacks cause damage to himself. It is an awful concept for a character, but not one that can't be avoided. It is *very* important to minimize the self-inflicted damage, especially since up-b and neutral b should be used often. Wherever possible, avoid using moves such as dair, fair, and down-b. Dair and fair can easily be replaced with nair in most situations (more about nair in the 'strategies' section).

* Pichu's attack range for ground based attacks is *terrible*. Ftilt is a complete joke in terms of range. You want to stay off the ground whenever possible, using SHFFLed nairs as your bread-and-butter approach option.

* Pichu suffers from high knockback. Learn the basics of DI and Crouch Canceling to keep you alive.

* Despite his many shortcomings, Pichu's recovery is very reliable (albeit predictable). Even when hit to the farthest corner, you can use  side b -&gt; jump -&gt; up b  to get back to the stage quickly. Learn to use up-b effectively for when you are hit below the stage.

* You *must* learn to space properly with Pichu. Rushing into battle spamming nair may be a valiant effort, but will almost surely get you killed.

* Pichu's grab game is good, and can set you up for combos (see the Pichu Beatchu combo in 'strategies' below). When all else fails, grab -&gt; dthrow.

* Use Pichu's speed and size to your advantage. Once your opponent is in the air, relentlessly attack him with uairs/nairs to keep him above you. If you're under a platform and well below your opponent, down-b is a viable option, but won't set you up for combos as well as uair. 

**STRATEGIES**

1) The Pichu Beatchu combo: This is Pichu's go-to killing move. Learn to use it depending on the type of character your opponent has and their percentage. Vary it up with a nair if your opponent is at a low percent. This combo is amazingly effective against spacies, but hard to do against floaties.

* Standard PB combo for medium weight characters:    Grab -&gt; dthrow -&gt; upsmash

* PB combo for spacies/fastfallers at low percent:    Grab -&gt; uthrow -&gt; upsmash

* PB combo for spacies/fastfallers at high percent:    Grab -&gt; dthrow -&gt; upsmash

* For floaty characters, or to vary it up against any character, use: Grab -&gt; uthrow -&gt; jump -&gt; nair 

2) Nair/Uair combos: best done on stages with low platforms, such as Yoshi's Story or FoD. Uair is incredibly effective at chaining combos in the air. A typical N/U combo would go like this: Uair -&gt; Uair -&gt; Nair. It's all improvisation, really, and it is tough to describe in detail because there are so many different contexts. Utilt is also a good move that will chain combos, especially if your opponent is above you but too close to do a uair. Bair comes in handy to mix these up as well.

3) Neutral b pressure and edgeguarding: Neutral b is Pichu's only projectile, dealing ~6% damage to the opponent and 1% damage to Pichu. Whenever possible, use this move in the air. This makes it harder for your opponent to punish you because you are jumping. This move is a critical part of Pichu's game on FD and Pokemon stadium. It is also a very effective edgeguard because of how slow it moves in midair. Practice the timing and you will be preventing your opponent's recovery in no time.

4) Recovery: As stated before, Pichu can come back from just about any attack that doesn't KO him. A typical recovery would be as such: side b -&gt; jump -&gt; up b. 

5) Dtilt spacing: Pichu's longest-ranged ground move is dtilt. Ideally, you should not have to use it, but certain scenarios call for it (i.e. preparing to crouch cancel an attack). 

6) Fsmash KOing: Fsmash very powerful attack with godawful range, and must be sweetspotted. Very easy to punish. If you're playing on a stage with a high ceiling, this move comes in handy. The timing and spacing required takes a lot of practice to get down however. Use this sparingly and only when you think it is necessary.

7) Moves which you should rarely or never use: fair, dair, ftilt, side b, down b (on FD in particular), downsmash (can be useful but *very* hard to hit properly).

8) Watch this video and study it, KoreanDJ is arguably the best Pichu player in the smash community: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENaWR-HWBlM

9) SHFFLed Nairs: Just do it.

**STAGES**

* Yoshi's Story: This stage is a double-edged sword for Pichu, and my personal favorite. Its low ceiling makes it wonderful for the PB combo, and the low platforms make the uair/nair combo game very effective. The short boundaries, however, are what will get Pichu killed more easily. Despite this problem, I've had the most success playing on Yoshi's Story.

* Fountain of Dreams: Almost as good as Yoshi's Story, but with a higher ceiling, making the PB combo a bit harder to reliably kill. The low platform layout is again heavily tilted in Pichu's favor, making this stage a viable option. 

* Pokemon Stadium: Pichu's home turf is actually a good option for the annoying rodent. The changing platforms allow for many combos. 

* Battlefield: The platforms here are slightly higher up than the other stages I listed, making it slightly tougher to do uair/nair combos but not impossible. The ledge is bad for just about any character. Pick this stage as a last resort if the three above are not available, because you *do not* want to play on Final Destination or Dreamland.

* Final Destination: No platforms severely hinder Pichu's combo game. Be ready to bust out a TON of grabs and a TON of neutral-b's. PB combo works well here, so if you grab your opponent, make them pay. Spacing is *critical* to your success on FD, more so than elsewhere. 

* Dreamland: For the love of God, stay far away from this stage. The ceiling in the stratusphere will be a godsend for a high KB character as Pichu, but his only reliable killing move is impossible (PB combo). If you do happen to end up on Dreamland: rack up damage using nairs and attempt to sweetspot your f-smash. Pichu lives for the vertical attack pattern, but here he is forced to kill horizontally. Good luck.

**CONCLUSION**

So there you have it. A simple guide to Pichu. Some may see this character as a joke, but I see him as a very rewarding challenge. It takes balls to main Pichu, and a lot of time needs to be invested to even take on Link. I hope you enjoyed reading this, feel free to add more tips in the comments!"	t5_2qiep	True

A few days back there was a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1k0hcu/what_games_do_you_like_to_play_inside_any_smash/) here about the little games we play within Smash, and I shared my favorite unofficial game mode, Peachball. Enough people commented, and I was bored enough, that I decided to make this post explaining the rules in detail. So here you go:

^^^^.


###THE OFFICIAL PEACHBALL RULEBOOK

*Peachball is an exciting new game mode in Super Smash Bros. Brawl in which two competitors attempt to smack an unconscious Princess Peach into the opposing player's goal.*

^^^^.

**I. THE PEACHBALL ARENA**

[Figure 1: The arena](http://i.imgur.com/H0qG7Rp.jpg)

The Peachball arena is a custom stage in Smash Bros. Brawl, developed by *SCIENCE* for optimum Peachballing. The stage is an enclosed 12 unit by 7 unit rectangular area with a goal on either side consisting of a 2-unit-wide opening set one unit above floor level and two units deep, with a 1:2 sloped floor sloping towards the back of the goal. The center line of the arena is delineated by an extra two blocks placed below the floor on either side of the center line. The roof of the Peachball arena is covered entirely in spikes, such that characters will not spawn outside of the field of play.

The name of the custom level housing the arena is at the discretion of the builder, but it is suggested that the builder cycle through the random names provided by pressing Z until he or she happens across one that causes anyone in the room at time of construction to giggle. The background music is likewise at the discretion of the builder, with the stipulation that it be something with a driving beat; the butt-rock provided in the F-Zero and Sonic folders is a very good choice.

^^^^.

**II. PREPARATIONS FOR PLAY**

Begin preparation by selecting Special Brawl and turning on Stamina Mode. No other Special Mode modifications are necessary. The two human-controlled competitors should each set their HP to 300. The competitors may select any character they like, including random selection, though if a competitor elects to play as Princess Peach he or she must use non-default colors. Nametags and custom controls are allowed. A CPU character should then be added and set to Princess Peach in default colors. Set Peach's HP to 1. Ensure that items are turned off. At this point, select the Peachball arena from the custom stage list to begin the match.

^^^^.

**III. GAMEPLAY**

When the match begins, both competitors should immediately scramble KO the CPU Peach. Peach will become inactive, but will still be whackable. The inert Peach should then be nudged to the center line of the arena.

To officially begin Peachballing, the player who KO'd Peach (if it is unclear which player dealt the killing blow, flip a coin) should yell ""3-2-1-PEACHBALL!"" while performing the attack of his or her choice to launch Peach into play from the center line. Both players are then free to attack Peach in any way they see fit, with the object of propelling her into the opponent's goal while defending their own.

*Competitors may also attack each other, with no restrictions.* However, players have a set amount of HP, and KOing the opposing player results in automatic disqualification and a victory for the KO'd player.

A goal is considered valid if a player knocks Peach into the opposing player's goal and she (Peach) touches any surface (ceiling, wall, or floor) in the goal area, even if she then bounces out. A goal is also valid if the attacking player knocks Peach into the goal and the defending player lands an attack on Peach that fails to prevent her from subsequently touching the ceiling, wall, or floor of the goal area. 

Knocking Peach into one's own goal (""own-goaling""), whether intentionally or accidentally, does not count as a goal for the other player. If a player own-goals, he or she is permitted to use any attack to launch Peach out of the goal area, but may not exit the goal area for five seconds after the launching attack.

After a valid goal is scored, the player against whom the goal was scored may use any attack to propel Peach from his or her goal (or from where she landed after bouncing out). Peach is considered ""fair"" (both players may attack) immediately after leaving the goal area, but the ""receiving"" player must stay on the opposite side of the center line until Peach is launched. The launching player does not need to wait as he or she would after an own-goal launch.

In standard Peachball rules, the first player to earn three points is declared the winner. At this point the competitors may immediately end the match with L+R+A+START, or fight to the death to blow off steam.

^^^^.

**GAMEPLAY VARIATIONS**

* Experienced Peachballers may want to increase or decrease the score limit for added challenge, or play a timed match in which whoever scores more goals in a set time limit is declared the winner.

* Items may be turned on for the match. Since most items will spawn outside the play area, they should generally be set to ""high."" It is often preferable to select only one or two items to be available rather than the full complement, which can be too unpredictable (unless you're into that). Consider bumpers for an extra obstacle, or a high-risk explosives match.

* Final Smashes may also be brought into play. In this case, the arena should be modified to replace one unit of roof spikes with a fall-down block so that characters who might exit the boxed-in area as part of their Final Smash may return. After the Final Smasher rides the block down, it will reappear in place and again block exit from the arena.

* Other modifications can be made to the arena; consider adding ice blocks, floating platforms, or springboards. Make sure, though, that Peach still cannot be knocked out of the field of play.

* Consider turning on other settings in special mode.

* An impartial third party may join the match, to act as referee or just mess with the players. Unfortunately two-player teams are impossible, though a 2-on-1 handicap is an option.

* Very little research has been conducted regarding the use of a different character than Peach for the ""ball."" Try Bowserball, Dededeball or Kirbyball and post your results here.

^^^^.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

* *Why Peach?*

The mechanics of Peachball were first discovered during a casual stamina match during which a CPU-controlled Princess Peach was KO'd and her body later unintentionally catapulted across the stage. Things went downhill from there.

* *What characters make the best Peachballers?*

Pikachu makes an excellent defender as his down-B lightning strike will still hit thanks to the arena's high ceilings and will arrest the momentum of an incoming Peach anywhere along a vertical line. King Dedede's dash attack will give a resting Peach enough air to pop right into the goal from a few blocks out. Charizard has powerful attacks with enough mobility, and Fox is agile with good movement-stoppers for defending. Ultimately it's up to you to figure out which character works best for you.

* *I think [rule] is unfair/the arena should have [x]*

We the esteemed progenitors of the great sport of Peachball have spent quite a lot of time dialing in the arena specs and the gameplay rules, but that's just what worked for us. Feel free to tweak things to suit your Peachballing preferences.

* *Was this rulebook really necessary?*

Nope!

* *Do you regret spending three hours writing it?*

Nope!

^^^^.

1369416627.0	1ezd8k	What do you want from University of Smash?	el-prog	88	11	24	"Hi gang,

Prog here.  So, not everyone is familiar with the U of Smash initiative, so I'll take a moment to explain it.

Basically, for any of you that saw the Revival of Melee 5 stream, two things came out of it:  

1.  Melee It On Me (A Melee centric podcast to talk about things that are going on in the community, positive and negative)

2.  Handwarmers that were excruciating in length.

Out of number two came the idea that eventually came to be the University of Smash initiative.  Basically, we're a volunteer collective who are looking to educate as well as give streamers additional content which will entertain the viewing audiences.  We want to kind of bridge the gap between stream viewer or casual player to have additional interest in our tournament scene, whether as a player, or as a more educated and involved viewer.

From the get go, I took the charge for the SSBM community, however, I invited King Funk (for Smash 64) and Mike Haze (for SSBB) to see what we're developing.  And I've given notice to a couple of P:M paragons that they are more than welcome to create their own content as well, and we'll host it.

So, what are we attempting to put out?  I haven't checked with the other groups recently, so I can solely speak on behalf of the SSBM project:

1.  YouTube:  Advanced How To Play/Apply.  A pair of videos being scripted by Strong Bad and Armada with Lucien, Kirbykaze, Wak, myself and others.  The older how to play is missing a few things that are across the whole cast, so we want to update it.  In addition, we want to talk theory, what's the use of learning every advanced technique if you don't think about or have a plan for when to do them?

2.  Youtube:  Tutorials.  We're looking at some specific tutorials, whether character specific (Mofo may do one for Ness, Leffen may do one for how to pick a character that suits your strengths, teching, pivoting, tech chasing may all have different tutorials as well to go further in depth than our previous videos).

3.  Twitch.TV:  How to Play (Abridged Version).  The YouTube version may end up being an hour, who knows at this point?  However, we want a 2-3 minute version to follow along with the most common concepts in our stream.

4.  Twitch.TV:  Various filler.  We may have character notes, player background information, maybe highlights of previous sets, etc.  This material should be between :20-:40 seconds in length.

Everything is still in production, and I would have liked to have something ready by now, but of course, other obligations have taken priority.  We will have a dropbox for any streamer who wants to access these files (as well as host trailers for upcoming series/regionals, etc. in the scenes, provided TOs send them to us so we can upload it).

That being said, I want to know what you all want to see as stream viewers, as players, as streamers, so on and so forth?  Be as generic or specific as you'd like.

Although everything is empty at this point, if you want to subscribe so when we don't have such a dearth you'll know:

[Our YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/UniversityofSmash)

[Our Twitter](https://twitter.com/UofSmash)

Thanks again, and be sure to send along your feedback.  Again, I wish I had a sample or anything at this point, but unfortunately, no one has been able to send anything my way as of yet."	t5_2qiep	True

For those who didn't see the original, Sakurai tweeted a [whiteboard sketch](http://imgur.com/a/c9Gz0#0) featuring Smash characters. I noticed a very slight amount of text on the bottom, and, ultimately, with the help of /u/not_bad_69 the text was figured out!

So, the solution is ""WELCOME!"" A little background- when devlopment for Smash 4 began, Sakurai joined with several other development teams, many of who were new to him. Following that, what was tweeted, and the answer text, this was probably drawn for him in their studio as nice way to welcome him in. Notice that Kirby and Pit are two of the most prominent characters- Kirby, who was created in part by Sakurai, and Pit, who in recent years has been under Sakurai's development. Notice, also, how large Pit is, and that he is placed as centered as such characters as Mario despite not being one of Nintendo's bigger characters (Mario, Metroid, Legend of Zelda, etc.)

As for the solving of the text, you see that go down [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/11i86s/challenge_hidden_message_from_sakurai/) Basically, after I noticed the text, I separated the ""bumps"" into columns as either individual letters of possible double-tiered letters (things like H, M, V, etc.) Then, based on the bump curvature, the width, and the relative distance (kerning) of the bumps, I [gridded out](http://i.imgur.com/WDV9V.jpg) all possible letters in their respective columns. The magic is when not_bad_69 noticed that there is a 3 bumped letter, ""W,"" since it has 3 places where it comes to a top point. Using this, W could be the first letter, and using remaining possible letters, not_bad_69 noticed ""WELCOME!"" is a viable, and also likely, option.

The gallery also includes the original tweeted image to show what the base was, and a new wallpaper sized version of the updated answer image. Enjoy!

1373322287.0	1hw7jr	[Melee] EVO Information Dump	Revven	86	11	24	"EVO 2013 is this weekend, July 12th to the 14th (Fri-Sun). For those of you going to the event, everybody at home wishes you the best of luck and to have a good time. Remember to stay clean at all times to avoid catching a cold but most importantly: BE ON TIME FOR POOLS. They will DQ you regardless of who you are if you’re late.

Also make sure to bring setups and your own controller! The tournament won’t progress very well if they’re short on setups. But if you can’t bring a TV, bring your Gamecube/Wii and a copy of Melee w/ memory card anyway, they will NEED it. You never know who will flake in regards to setups.

Gambling is banned at the venue and by extension that includes money matches. Keep them low key or in hotel rooms, otherwise if any of the EVO staff catches you they WILL kick you out.

Don't mess up this opportunity by being stupid! Be on your best behavior, you're representing MORE than yourself at this tournament; you're representing the community. Respect the other players and communities there. Use deodorant and stay hygienic, while the rooms will smell regardless it helps to do your part.

Basically: use common sense!

First time going to EVO? Want to keep track of your matches/pools? Download and install the EVO Mobile Guidebook App to your Android or Phone: http://guidebook.com/g/evolution/

If you can’t use the guidebook, be sure to find your pool here and write a reminder for yourself what time it is: http://evo2013.s3.amazonaws.com/brackets/index.html And for those at home you can use that link to follow along on what pools are happening when.

Speaking of those at home, the stream schedule for the main EVO streams are here: http://shoryuken.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/evo-stream-schedule.png

And here are the individual links to each stream:

http://twitch.tv/srkevo1
http://twitch.tv/srkevo2
http://twitch.tv/srkevo3

If you want to watch all three, here's a multi-twitch link: http://www.multitwitch.tv/srkevo1/srkevo2/srkevo3

You can only chat in those streams if you’re subbed to them, it costs $12 to sub and the money goes to the EVO scholarship fund. You also get access to archives and HD quality. It is completely free to watch, of course, but you will be watching at a lower quality and won't have access to the archives for anything you may miss overnight.

But wait!! There’s more! www.twitch.tv/vgbootcamp will be streaming some of Day 1 Melee pools! So be sure to follow them as soon as you can so you can be notified when they’re online. Keep in mind that they are an unofficial streamer for the event so VGBC cannot run ads. Their connection will also not be very top notch so they might go down a few times while streaming (just a warning so you aren't mad when it happens!) If you want to support them at all, now is the time to do so by subscribing for $5 which gains you instant access for a month to special Smash-related emotes you can use in ANY stream channel. You can immediately cancel the renewal so you aren’t charged the following month and you will STILL be able to use the emotes for the month you subscribed.


Not only that but www.twitch.tv/CLASHTournaments will be streaming during the after hours of EVO on both Friday and Saturday nights in a hotel room to bring you the matches that might not happen in bracket. With so many players attending this year’s EVO tournament (696!!) not everyone will be able to play each other. So follow their channel to make sure you’re notified when they’re live, which according to CT they should be live at around 11 PM PST or later. This stream may have high stakes money matches and even a 6 or 10 character crew battle between M2K and Mango! You DO NOT want to miss it! Don't forget if you want to support them you can subscribe just like vgbootcamp, it's only $5.

And of course there will be streams throughout the week from other Smashers such as www.twitch.tv/pbnj23 and more! If there are any other Smashers streaming from hotel rooms they will be posted when they’re live.

This is basically everything. Are you ready for EVO 2013? You better be! It's only a few days away!

I wanted to share a project I am currently organising, a Super Smash Bros fan arrangement album called **Harmony of Heroes**, featuring themes from Super Smash Bros, Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Brawl. The album will offer a diverse range of musical genres and talent and will be available to download next year.

I have previously organised two Metroid albums called Harmony of a Hunter and Harmony of a Hunter: 101% Run. The first was released to mark the 25th Anniversary of the Metroid franchise, while the follow-up expansion was created to mark the 10th anniversary of Metroid Prime, and to compliment the first album by covering tracks that didn't make it the first time around. A Smash Bros album seems like a logical step to expand on what we had already achieved, while retaining the fans we had already made.

Our team involves a wide range of talent with a passion and love for Smash Bros. We hope Harmony of Heroes is a project that fans of the franchise will love and appreciate.

Be sure to check out the links below for more information on Harmony of Heroes. If anyone would like to get in touch to help me promote this further, please feel free!

**THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY EASIER ANYWHERE ELSE, THIS IS AS SIMPLE AS I CAN MAKE IT**, I'mm going to put up my SD card contents that i use for all sorts of hack sets up for download so you can just **drag** and **drop** to any empty SD card.

BEFORE WE BEGIN **I'm going to assume you already have the Homebrew channel installed on your Wii**, if not, inbox me and ill be happy to help you. [**HERE IS A TUTORIAL**](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_setup#Setting_up_Homebrew_Channel) on how to install Homebrew in case I don't respond quickly enough (Use the smash stack method shown in the tutorial, if you still have trouble, message me), in order to FULLY set up your wii for any kind of hacks, you may need a specific SD card, but you can still install Homebrew with an SD card that is above 2GB. The Homebrew channel is basically all you NEED (For things im going to teach you, like installin Project M, Brawl-, The Classic Expansion Pack, etc.) anything else is just for unecessary modifications to do to your Wii for whatever reason.
A LOT of people are going to tell you a 2GB card is essential but it **IS NOT**!!! if you use GeckoOS on Homebrew, it will be. BUT I've found **Riivolution** to be more stable and **it can support SDHC cards** (higher than 2GB) so if you have 2GB you're fine, 4GB also fine, etc...

* First of all, **format your SD card** to **FAT** or **FAT32** (On my 4GB SD card I use FAT32 because sometimes FAT doesn't work very well for some reason)

* Just right click your SD card on you computer and click ""**format**"", then uncheck ""**quick format**"" so it completely CLEARS your SD card contents. (REMEMBER TO TAKE OUT ANY OF YOUR SD CARD'S CONTENTS THAT YOU DONT WANT TO BE DELETED PERMANENTLY!!!)

* So once you do that, just **download these folders** (The essential ones)

THEY'RE UP FOR DOWNLOAD PUBLICLY ON GOOGLE DOCS, just click ""**file**"" and then ""**download**""

They're in a zip file so just unzip it and put the contents on your SD card. [**CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THEM**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4bFJQTDRsbDM1X2M/edit?usp=sharing)

So once you have those *3 essential folders*, **now its time to pick your mods**.

I have set up 4 download links, **if you need any more information on any of the sets, ask me in the comments.**

**THE FOLLOWING DOWNLOAD LINKS HAVE FOLDERS THAT GO IN THE ""brawlmods"" folder** (**remember to unzip them first**)

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4aldhaHRnSUVqM3c/edit?usp=sharing) (579 MB) has Project M, Project M with the Expansion Pack, and the Expansion pack by itself

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4VGxfSDM2c0RoNWM/edit?usp=sharing) (348 MB) has Brawl-, Brawl- with the Expansion Pack, and Basic Brawl Hacks (Its in a folder labeled brawlplus, but it IS NOT the official brawl plus hacks set, i dont really find that one all that great)

* [THIS ONE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4blRoZXF3c2pzWGs/edit?usp=sharing) (165 MB) has Basic Brawl with TEXTURE HACKS that i find to be really well done or just fun to play as.

* [THIS ONE]( https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4_3ItSbnvk4RWpJOG9mUHNVYXM/edit?usp=sharing) (806 MB) has the music folder that has alternate songs, A LOT OF THEM!!! They're all great and i think i did good in putting them in their appropriate locations :)


**REMEMBER** ANY OF THE MODS YOU DOWNLOADED JUST NOW GO IN THE ""**brawlmods**"" folder

So now once you're done, you...

1. Start up your Wii 

2. Go to the Homebrew channel

3. Launch  the ""Riivolution channel"" (**YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR SD CARD IN THE WII BEFORE YOU START RIIVOLUTION**, its not going to hurt your Wii, it will just take longer to run the hacks when you launch the game if the SD card isn't already in there) there will be an install button at the right that installs that channel on your home menu so you don't have to keep opening up Homebrew. 

4. **PRESS INSTALL** (It just makes things easier)! then it gives you the option to choose which hack set you want, use the **left** and **right** arrows to choose them **(THERE IS A .TXT FILE IN THE ""brawlmods"" FOLDER THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT FOLDERS CONTAIN WHAT SETS IN CASE YOU FORGET, so use that file to decide which set you want to use when you're picking them on Riivolution)**. 

5. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS **TURNED ON** BEFORE YOU LAUNCH THE GAME, because if somethings are turned off those hacks will not be implemented.

**NOW YOU HAVE A FUNCTIONAL RIIVOLUTION CHANNEL, once you pick  hack set you downloaded just launch the game and have fun** :)


JUST A FEW QUICK NOTES!!! 

* THE CLASSIC EXPANSION PACK (CEP) is basically a pack that adds stages to brawl from all the different smash games, making it to a total of **77 stages**, more info can be found [**HERE**](http://www.lakora.us/brawl/cep/5.2/) of the version I am using

* The individual CEP is different from the one one that was built for Project M because the songs are in different places. So when you play Project M with the CEP, all the songs will be in the appropriate places but **not** when you play the CEP by itself.
SO in order to fix that, just go to the music folder and rename the ""**strm**"" folder to something that will remind you that is the music list for Project M and the CEP. If you want to play **JUST** the Expansion pack and NOT with project M at the same time, there is another folder there named ""**CEP strm**"" rename it to ""**strm**"" and you're done :D but make sure the original ""strm"" folder is named something different so you **don't merge the 2**.


* If you downloaded the textures, there is an excel sheet in the ""**brawlmods**"" folder that shows you what **textures** are on what **character** and what **costume/color** :D

I **don't** have a list like that one for the music yet :( sorry, but I can assure you that you'll like most of them. You can check which songs were added by going to the ""**My music**"" settings on brawl under the ""**Options**"" button on the main menu and playing through the songs. **If you want to create your own .brstm files, inbox me and ill send you the brstm converter I use.**

* There are 2 versions of the **RSBE01.gct** in the ""**projectm**"" folder, one of them has a code that makes all the pokemon (from the item) legendary, if you **don't** want it on, rename the **RSBE01.gct** to **RSBE01(Legendary Pokemon).gct** or whatever you need to to remember, and the other one **RSBE01.gct** (The one titled ""**RSBE01.gct**"" is the one that WILL be put into effect, if it has any other name, it wont be implemented)

* **Brawlcustommusic.com** is a VERY good website to get music from, although their website goes down quite often you can check up on the status of it or message the moderators of that website on their [**FACEBOOK PAGE**](https://www.facebook.com/brawlcustommusic?fref=ts), it comes in brstm form already when you download from that site and you just have to put it in the ""**strm**"" folder in ""**SD:/brawlmods/music/strm**"" under the appropriate name, the list of song code-names [CAN BE FOUND HERE](http://forums.kc-mm.com/index.php?topic=26697.0) 

* If you want to change the names of songs as they appear in game when a match starts follow [**THIS TUTORIAL**](http://www.smashboards.com/threads/step-by-step-guide-with-pics-on-how-to-edit-music-titles-using-brawlbox-updated.255990/) If you downloaded my music pack and want a copy of the mu_menumain.pac and info.pac that has the replaced song names i currently have, message me :)

* FINAL NOTE! In the second mod download link that has basic brawl with basic codes (infinite jumps, infinite shield, infinite up-b, etc.) the RSBE01.gct is in the wrong place (my bad) just move it from ""**brawlmods/brawlplus**"" to the ""**brawlmods**"" folder so when you start up riivolution you can just select ""brawl w/ codes"" when you're picking the hack/mod set you want to use.

* If you have any questions regarding how to delete/add/move certain textures, songs, **ASK ME! OR anyone else here**, we're here to help :)

1350593110.0	11pjus	A competitive player's opinion on Brawl vs Melee (included: reasoning)	xroflmaowtfx	95	24	60	"Whenever I see anti-Brawl posts from people I've never heard of, I usually expect it to be mindless, regurgitated drivel, filled with (untrue) cliches about both games, so I wanted to make this post as a more educated argument on why Brawl isn't as ""good"" of a game as Melee is.


I'll clear the air right now and say this: I think Brawl requires skill. It clearly requires skill because there's a competitive scene with relatively consistent results. Tripping is a slap in the face to competitive players, but I don't think it affects overall gameplay that much compared to ALL THE GAMEPLAY DIFFERENCES IN BRAWL. Yes, a trip can win or lose you the match for sure, but I'm saying that it's not the MAIN REASON that Brawl isn't as enjoyable as Melee.


The biggest thing that makes Brawl ""worse"" (or more-disliked) than Melee is just.... it's not a very exciting game.


I'll start with combos and punishment. The hitstun in Brawl is super low, so there's almost no combos.... so that's kinda boring. I mean, yeah, there's still depth involved because you have to constantly be jocking for hits and jocking for position, but LET'S KEEP IT REAL. We're playing a COMPETITIVE VIDEO GAME. We want flashy, cool, and exciting shit to happen now and again. If we wanted it to be about positioning the WHOLE way through, we could just play a board game or something. 64 is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum in terms of combos. The combos in that game are kinda overpowered since hitstun is SUPER high and because there's no DI aside from smash DI. Well, if the combos are so strong, that's kinda lame too. Melee has a more balanced combo system where you can do a lot to your opponent, but they have a LOT of options to try to mess up your combos (DI, teching, etc) in return, which makes for a really fun and dynamic combo system with a lot of room for PvP skill.


Now, I'll go into the neutral game!


One side of the coin: aggression. Brawl (and 64, to be honest) does not reward aggression. Melee's the only Smash game that really allows you to play really aggressively (but it isn't a mindlessly aggressive game. defense still has a slight advantage in Melee, but the thing is, defense puts you in the passenger seat, which isn't really good) at a high level (unless you're Isai in 64), and that's because it is an incredibly smooth game where you have a lot of mobility and room to do ANYTHING. Like... Melee's freedom and variability in control allows you to be really deep and really creative with how you maneuver and outplay your opponent. Brawl doesn't have the same type of movement, and therefore, it doesn't allow for creative, aggressive play the same way that Melee does. Like, for example, whenever you dash forward in Brawl, you're almost committed to it. In MELEE, if you dash forward, you have a lot of mobility options to outmaneuver your opponent. You can dashdance back, wavedash back, cancel the dash with a shield, jump, and more. In brawl, there's no dashdancing, wavedashing, or using shields to cancel the initial dash, so as a result, aggressive movement becomes more limited, linear, and predictable. Brawl players walk around more in their game because it's not as commitment-intensive as dashing is and it offers them a similar freedom, but the result in the end is... the movement is a LOT less dynamic in Brawl than it is in Melee. IMO, Brawl movement is KINDA like Street Fighter movement. But yeah, Brawl offers less room for creativity when you're on the offensive, and as a result, aggression in Brawl is easier to zero in on and punish. In addition, Brawl is just a slower and floatier game, so the defending player has more time to see you approaching, react, and punish. ON TOP OF THAT, the aggressive options in actual character-to-character EXCHANGES in Brawl are just... weaker than defensive options. For example, there's no l-canceling in Brawl, so aerial aggression is more punishable on landing lag alone. Part of being able to open up on people in Melee is by playing off the uncertainty and fear in your opponent. you're able to threaten people a lot more with your movement in melee by making it LOOK LIKE you're going to attack and then not doing it.... or you can convince your opponent that you're not going to attack and then doing it. There's this big gray area in Melee where you can apply pressure to your opponent and play with their head. Using movement as an attack threat has actual WEIGHT in melee because aggressive options are a more viable (and less risky, in some situations) threat in Melee. In summary, aggression in melee is a lot better because you're able to move around more freely AND because the actual aggressive options themselves have viable stats. I mean, Brawl is a deep enough game so that people still have to play this guessing game with their opponents, take risks, play similar games with their enemies, and whatnot, but the game itself doesn't lend itself to this as well as Melee does.


Now for the opposite end of the spectrum: defense. Defensive options are, for the most part, stronger in Brawl. For example, shielding, spotdodging, and rolling are all a lot stronger in Brawl. Spotdodging and rolling have a lot less lag, so they're harder to punish therefore, a bit more spammable (not 100% spammable, obviously). Shield stun is a lot lower in Brawl, so you have a lot more time to punish people whenever they hit your shield. On top of that, dropping your shield is REALLY fast in Brawl, so your options out of shield are similar to your options When you're not shielding... whereas in melee, being in shield SLIGHTLY ties your hands behind your back. It is a different kind of situation. You have a smaller handful of options, so overall, being in shield is a bit more limited than not being in shield, which makes it so that you have to think twice before overly resorting to blocking in melee, but you're still able to do stuff out of your shield (unlike 64).

There's a LOTTTT more to say on the matter, but I'll end it here. I think that was a decent overview."	t5_2qiep	True

MagicHobbes	77	8	22	"I go back and forth between Brawl and Melee/PM. I entered a local Brawl tournament (24 players single elimination) and thought it would be pretty good. Then my rival signs up the day before the tourney and I get nervous.

I end up having some close calls but make it all the way to finals. He play G and W, I play ZSS. We were both at quite high percentages when he does a grab to down throw to hammers combo. I just barely tech it and manage to get spacing again. Now I usually panic in these situations which has resulted in me getting second place frequently.

But then I thought, the only thing that will happen if I lose is that people will say that I played a great and very close game. So I just sort of relaxed. 

And something happened that I've never had happen in any game of smash ever. I actually didn't have pressure. I was just playing super smash. I almost zoned out, I can't call it in the zone because I was more just staring at the screen. I started to just keep spacing and keep using my whip. I kept shield pressure on and then it happened. I got my down smash on him. And I took the oppurtunity.

And I won my first super smash tournament in my 2 year or so ""career"". I finally felt what it was like to have everyone in the room go absolutely nuts and start high fiving. Honestly it was the coolest feeling I've ever had in gaming and I won't ever forget it.

**TL:DR** I faced off against the best player in my local brawl scene and won my first tournament. Coolest moment of my gaming life."	t5_2qiep	True

Here are the designs I created for the r/smashbros' shirt. **These are absolutely rough drafts.** The characters chosen, the colors in the designs and the colors of the shirts, and even the designs themselves are rough, and non final. These designs are meant to show how the final designs could look, after final color / character choice.

The designs are profile shots of a single character per shirt. If we have a large enough response, several different shirt designs could be made, so that you could choose your character. The designs are colored wireframe models of Smash Bros. characters- this way, the design is somewhat abstract, and visually interesting, while also representative of something from the games. On the back of the shirt is the subreddit's Snoo.

While charcoal grey is the best color for all the designs, each shirt could have unique colors, based on either the character it shows, or just what is most appealing given the particular shirt's colors.

Additionally, the smash logo could or could not appear. If not on the front, it could appear on the back, or not at all.

[Previews here. Please read descriptions above, first.](http://imgur.com/a/Kt9JO#0)

*EDIT: Since reception seems positive,  I'd appreciate feedback on your favorite characters, to help me choose which will appear on the final designs. If you have a preferred color option, feel free to list that too. Right now, it sounds like Captain Falcon is a pretty decisive #1, so he will likely be the choice if we only produce one design. However, if we end up having the numbers to produce more, the other characters are still up to you all.*

*EDIT 2: Seems like Captain Falcon is definitely the most popular, he will likely be design #1. Falco also received a lot of request, as did Marth and Mario. If anyone else has any particularly strong opinions on character choice, please feel free to voice them below.*"	t5_2qiep	True

A lot of international players (without whom APEX would be unremarkable) have been treated like shit in the past, and many empty promises have been made to other staff members as an impulsive extortion technique. These are a couple examples of big problems that have arisen as a result of Alex Strife's negligence to adequately plan these matters. The stolen property is just another example of Alex Strife's negligence, in this case to hire (or at least ensure) proper security.

Of course it's a tragedy that so much valuable equipment was stolen. What makes me upset, though, is that Alex Strife has used this *a number of times* to extract sympathy from both individuals and the community as a whole. I'm being really blunt here, but let me summarize: Alex Strife is a greedy, immature person who treats his underpaid staff like shit and is evidently incapable of running such a large-scale tournament. This is all shoved under a facade of cries for sympathy and exaggerated claims such as ""I went through hell"" and ""I take the shirt off my back to help people"".

This comment may come as a shock to many. However, a fair amount of the community has interacted with Strife, and many feel the same way. They simply have never had the chance to speak out, mostly because they are tightly knit with the community/tournament scene and cannot afford the risk of community backlash. I understand that I am being pretty blunt and mean, but as someone who has been personally affiliated with Alex Strife and some of his staff, I hope people find at least some merit in what I've explained. Go ahead and tear me to shreds, but I (and a pocket-sized portion of the community) silently await the day we see a new large-scale tournament organizer on the east coast.

By the way, I am not currently affiliated with Alex Strife in any way, so please don't try to make false accusations.

I can't tl;dr this without getting my full point across, so please read the full text.

We came to the tournament with no real biases since we weren't very familiar with the players, but Wobbles made us instant fans. 

He was the first to sign our GameCube, had some of the most exciting games, and even took the time to play 1v1s and an FFA with my friends and I. We are peasant tier players, can't even wavedash or any of that fanciness, but he was extremely nice about everything and fun to play with.

I know he's gotten shit for his wobbling in the past, but this guy absolutely deserves his success in the tournament, and I can't wait to see more from him in the future.

1372373487.0	1h7lhp	[Melee] Evo Hype Thread	NMWShrieK	71	14	50	"Evo is nearing.  In case you missed the trailer post a few days ago, here's a fantastic video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HbLvZpHkYg

Besides the fact that IT'S EVO!!! and that we raised so much money to be at this point, here are some reasons to be excited.

1) It is BY FAR the biggest Melee tournament in history.  Expect final attendance to be near double the previous record.

2) ClashTournaments will be hosting Salty Suite--an unofficial, no holds barred event starring your favorite players and casters, whom you may not get see on the official stream, such as HMW.  Here's the link for that if it's news to you http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qStm6t6nwsc

2.5) Ken returning with even more practice than before.  Also, Scar vs Ken runback, presumably as a part of Salty Suite.

3) Legendary Falcon players Hax, S2J, Scar, Darkrain, and SS are all attending.  As far as I know, there have been no sets between Hax and S2J or between Darkrain and S2J.

4) JMan and Shiz are both confirmed.  After being totally rusty and still having an impressive performance at Zenith, expect good things from Shiz.

5) Armada potentially returning

6) Hype matches that have never happened.  The Falcon matches from 3).  Ice/Android vs many players (don't sleep on Armada's brother Android, he is super good!)  Hax vs PewPewU.  Ken vs Armada.  etc.

7) Great story lines of all kinds.  Below are the ones that I thought of off the top of my head, and I'm sure there are tons more!  

Mango looked on fire at Zenith, will this continue?  Armada is rusty, but still looked amazing in BEAST3 friendlies, will his dominance continue?  Will SS BEAT HIM AGAIN ?!?!? (lol).  Hax has been solid all year, will he be able to not only defeat other contenders like Axe and Shiz, but finally break through into the top 4?  PewPewU is finally atop the NorCal power ranking, will he and his bff SFAT be able to step it up at nationals, or will Shroomed continue to outplace the rest of his region, despite his lackluster year in NorCal.  Westballz and S2J are eternally hyped by WC, but they haven't done well at nationals.  Is it finally time for them to show their A game?  Wobbles, coming off a great performance at KoC2, as well as Fly Amanita, are going to be at a wobbling legal national.  Will this make a difference?  Ice is coming from Europe, and taking a set from Mango is something that only a small handful of people have done in recent years.  Moreover, it was in PAL, and playing NTSC should only help his already amazing tech chasing skills.  Can he show that Europe is a region that still has serious contenders?"	t5_2qiep	True

1.  What is EVO?

Evo, or the Evolution Championship Series, is basically the Super Bowl for Fighting Games.  It is the annual culmination of many events in the FGC.  

2.  What does this have to do with Smash Bros?

Smash is returning to EVO.  Melee was there in 2007 with Ken winning, Hugs second, Mango 3rd, PC Chris in 4th.  Brawl was there in 2008 with CPU winning, Ken taking 2nd, Hall in 3rd and SK92 in 4th (However, they weren't using the tournament standard rules).  Melee will be there for the first time in 6 years, and already has shattered attendance records for a singles only event.

3.  When and where is it?

EVO is held at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.  July 12-14th.

4.  Can I register?

Yes!  Until the 30th of June, you can register at http://evo.shoryuken.com/register/

4.  Can I spectate?

Yep, you can register as a spectator at the above link.

5.  Can I register as a player?  

Yes, at the above link.  However, due to fire safety hazards, you won't be allowed access to the main ballroom on Sunday during top 8, you'll be in a secondary hall.  

6.  Will there be doubles?

Probably not.  Two days of pools has already been confirmed, so a side event of doubles is unlikely.  

7.  I'm going, can I help?

Mr. Wizard has requested televisions/gamecubes:
http://smashboards.com/threads/tvs-and-gamecubes.336265/page-2#post-15511900

8.  What can I expect?  

Hype.  It doesn't matter what game you play, but some of the most iconic fighting game moments have happened at this series.  For Melee, we have a storyline of raising nearly 100K, Ken being there to give up (or defend) the throne, Armada's retirement leaving the title of best in the world back up for grabs, the largest event in Smash history (numbers wise), etc.  

9.  I can't make it.

No worries.  VGBootcamp will be streaming Melee action, we will be broadcast during top 8 at some point.  Also, if you like it dangerous afterhours, ClashTournaments is doing a salty unsanctioned smash suite.  So, some of your favorites will be playing and some of your favorite commentators (including HMW) will have no holds barred."	t5_2qiep	True

Here's a few of mine I've come across while playing Melee:

* The village in the background on Rainbow Cruise. What is it there for? No such establishment existed in Mario 64, or the mountain it resides on for that matter.

* Captain Falcon Carries a gun in a holster, but he never uses it.

* One of Pichu's outfits is a pair of goggles. In Brawl, Pikachu also has a pair of goggles as an outfit. Could this mean that the Brawl Pikachu is the evolved form of Melee's Pichu?

* The special video in Melee briefly shows a few matches on a beta version of Temple. There are large platforms shown that don't exist in the final game.

* Using an action replay, one can access the ""Tavern"" stage. It is merely a stage to test the physics of the game, with a photo of a tavern plastered onto the background.

I had one month with every stage, it took me 11 years to do that. It took me from 4 years old to 15 years old. Now here I am with my new save file, with nothing. I know how to unlock everything, it would take me maybe a month at most. But that's not the point. This save file meant a lot to me.

The development of Smash Bros. is unfortunately taking it's toll on Sakurai. We need to encourage him with some positive feedback to him and the team themselves.

If you have twitter/Facebook hashtag it with #YouCanDoItSakurai

If you have a Miiverse account go to the Official Smash Bros. Community website and draw it up with the hashtag. We need REDDIT's positive energy and INFLUENCE THE DECISION MAKING WITHIN SAKURAI AND EVENTUALLY MAKE A GREAT SMASH BROS. GAME. SUPPORT THIS CAUSE.

It's fucking pissing me off. 

I remember watching Melee it on Me and I don't remember if it was Cl0ckwerk or someone else but scar asked him why there was a stigma against Melee being considered in the FGC and why people didn't consider it a serious competitive fighting game. His answer was along the lines of ""I think smash is a competitive game and since it's a serious fighting game people do consider part of the FGC."" But the simple truth is that it isn't. People shit all over smash because of misconceptions and simply being ignorant. I'm even surprised how considerate he was being when he gave his answer, and personally I would have preferred it if he just flat out said people don't consider it a competitive game, because that's the truth. You can't just avoid that (I understand he was talking to hundreds of people so there's some pressure to be polite, but he was talking on behalf of the 2D fighter community, and a lot of them are obnoxiously vocal about smash).

And it's not like we look at other fighting games and act like they're not good enough because they're not smash or they're not fighting games or competitive because they don't have shields or platforms or prominent air to air combat. When did we base the entire 2D fighter genre by it's weakest gameplay aspects (ie mashfest)?

This doesn't have to do with Skullgirls. This doesn't have to do with SF2T. This is just my way of destressing through means of public rant. Sorry for taking your time.

* Who wants to see XYZ as a playable character in SSB4?
* Check out this moveset I created for XYZ!
* Wouldn't XYZ be an awesome feature to have in SSB4?

This is the first iteration of these ""official"" discussion threads, so consider this a test run. The mod team is still trying to hone in on the best way to strike a balance between content and general discussion on /r/smashbros, so please bear with us!

We are happy to have new comers whether you are already a competive smasher or your just starting out and want to learn or just continue to play casually. We have a good mix of all those players and a majority of them are very kind and welcoming. However I have one request. After seing much of this in the past few days. If you are new to this subreddit and you come in and attempt to bash and tell us how competitve play is stupid not worth it or nerdy. You are probably in the wrong subreddit. Regardless of how good or bad a player you are this is not a place for trash talking or the putting down of other players. You are entitled to your opinion but if that opinion is all competitve play is stupid, you are in the wrong place. Let us have our fun and give it a chance. If you dont like it don't try and take it from us just don't watch it. 
 
 
edit: This goes for competetive players to who rag on someone just for liking brawl. 
 
edit 2: Yea this goes for the competitve players beating up on the new guys to. Its very very rare I see it happen but with an influx of new people to the sub reddit weird things happen.

1361490996.0	18zk4p	Why ban items? -An old school Melee player's perspective-	olipei9008	56	9	70	"This was from a dude named Trekiros on the comments from IGN's annoucement about Melee rules @ EVO, specifically to a person who questioned why items were banned (as many non-competitive players are wont to do).

It's a well thought out comment that I think anyone, competitive or noncompetitive, can appreciate!


""I'm going to reply on the oldest comment mentioning items, to be more visible. The reason why items are banned are the following ones :

1) Their spawning location is random. We would not have banned them if this wasn't the case.

2) Their spawning timing is random. We would not have banned them if it wasn't the case.
Note : we haven't banned Peach, who can spawn items with one of her moves, because it's the player that controls this spawn of items.

3) Some items (actually, most of them) are able to turn the tide of the match. If you have an item near you, there is no reason to not use it. Items are your character's best moves, no matter what your character is. Thus, it removes creativity, diversity, and lowers the learning curve. We banned these very early, they have never really been used in tournaments.

4) Some items have random outcomes, so even if you intend to use them skillfully, you have no control over the consequences of your actions. We have banned these a bit later, about 1 year and a half after the release of the game.

5) After we banned random outcome items and overpowered items, only food was left. We played with food on for about a year, then banned it too, thus resulting in all items being banned.

6) As we discovered the more obscure mechanics of the game, like Directional Influence, our many movement techniques like wavedashes and pivots, and Move Staleness, items were just not even an interesting mechanic for competitive play, no competitive plaer ever tried to have them back ever after. Google or youtube these four things if you're motivated, it'll make the show at EVO much more enjoyable for you, for you'll be able to understand most of what's happening.

Here's an extreme case study of an item match : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EFx0-Zkn54

Now, all item matches turn out to be that bad. We have become really good at using them, and are able to overcome the randomness in most cases. But not all of them, as this example shows. As soon as money is on the line, we are not willing to put our entry fee to the test of luck. We only want our skill to decide what placement we'll get.

As it turns out, we are a couple thousands players who have been playing this game a couple hours a week for the last 12 years, so nobody knows more than us that items are fun. But nobody knows more than us why items shouldn't be allowed into competitions. Take the amount of item matches you've played, multiply it by ten thousands, and you'll get an idea of how experienced each one of us is with items.

Kind regards, and thanks to those who will take the time to read this. We will probably do a couple videos to explain Melee to the non-Melee gamers as a teaser for EVO. See you there !""

I've done considerable amounts of work in both Melee and Brawl hacking, for [SSBMO](http://ssbmo.com) and [Project M](http://projectm.smashmods.com), respectively. I've had a lot of people ask what the process is like, or how they could get started themselves. Well, now is your chance to check out the process first-hand!

The session would likely be an hour or two long. I'll come up with a ""lesson plan"", a few codes to write, rehearse the procedure, etc. If I were to do this, I'd probably do it about a week from now, maybe the Saturday after this coming one. I'm gauging interest because this will take some time and effort to plan out, so I want to make sure there are enough people interested before I get started in doing so.

Dr_Robotnik	75	31	128	"I've been noticing for quite a while now that many of you have very negative opinions about Brawl, and that many of you are rather abrasive in your expression of this, and express said opinions very liberally. While I understand many of you do not like this game, I ask you to refrain from complaining about it unless the situation would be suitable for your input (ex. someone asking for it or for clarity of your point of view), and even then, please do not bash it. I know what at least a few of you are thinking; ""hey, you just don't want people to express negative opinions about the game you like"". While it is true that I personally have a low tolerance for Brawl bashing, I am saying this not for myself, but for the good of the subreddit. You see, this subreddit is for every Smash fan, it says so right in the sidebar. When people constantly engage in bashing Brawl and do so with little provocation, it makes this place a very hostile environment for Brawl fans. This, obviously, would mean that they do not subscribe and do not revisit. This is not just a made up scenario. I have friends that are competitive Brawl fans and redditors that have told me that they left for these reasons. And I know what else at least a few of you are thinking; ""Brawl does not deserve special treatment, the same thing could happen to any of the games"". This, which is not just a strawman, because it was actually argued against me by someone, is not correct. Theoretically on paper and heavily depending on the circumstances, this is technically possible, but would realistically never happen in a million years. Why not? Because they would be downvoted and heavily contested by the much larger amount of people who disagree with them. This is obviously not the case with Brawl, and  usually the contesters receive this treatment instead. I am not saying not to do this to people trying to bash a game, I'm just asking you to be gentler on Brawl so that we can be a more even community."	t5_2qiep	True

We're still working very hard on Luigi to make him the best he can possibly be. Tool assistance has put the potential score down to 3.16, so human hands may end up getting around 3.3x. That's a roughly .60 second drop nearly overnight in a 12 year old game.

Thank you again for all of the kind words over the last few months. In closing, I'd like to leave you with an improvement to Luigi I have not uploaded on YouTube yet.

2 or 3 players can play. One extra controller is needed. 

A 3 player game will be used in this example. 3 kirbys, 1 caption falcon. The captain falcon must be chosen by the extra controller, and he will not be played. Start the game. 


The point of the game: get kills wearing the falcon hat. 

Rules: 

1. Only one hat at a time. Once someone swallows falcon, you must swallow that person to get the hat. 

2. If you die wearing the hat, then falcon is free to be swallowed again by any other player. 

3. Only kills wearing the hat count. 

4. Kills without wearing a hat can either a) not count, or b) count negative. Counting kills without the hat as negative encourages people to not kill the hat wearer (or others without the hat) , but rather to just swallow him. It makes the game more fun in my opinion. 

5. Kirby pawnch is the preferred method of scoring kills, this is a style game. Other kills count, but the reason we use falcon is for his falcon pawnch. 


You will see that the majority of the match will be trying to swallow each other, with quick falcon punches in between. This game is super fun. It was created when me and a friend were super high and just fucking around. "	t5_2qiep	True

1376623166.0	1kgrjm	[PSA] Falco and Marth shirts by Clash Threads featuring significant misprints, info inside	Ike_Lawliet	45	5	12	"(Mostly copy-pasta from a separate thread.)

I'm the maker of the shirt- firstly, I am very, deeply sorry for the awful and enormous nature of the misprints. It was brought to my attention today that many, if not perhaps all of the Marth and Falco products feature a severe misprint, in which the graphic is quite a bit smaller than it should be. A misprinted shirt looks [like this,](http://i.imgur.com/7y3gb8Y.jpg) while a correct shirt should have [these proportions.](http://i.imgur.com/CWjdH0m.jpg)) It is not clear yet whether some shirts or perhaps the entire Marth and Falco line feature these errors. Irrelevant of whether this happened multiple times or not, I'm extremely sorry.

**To those with shirts with errors, if you will please PM me either your ordering name or email info, I will contact TeeSpring (the printing agent) first thing tomorrow, when they open to remedy this.** If you can, please include a picture of the shirt (can be from a phone, etc.) as proof to show TeeSpring. You will absolutely get, at least, a full refund. I really, *really* appreciate your support, and cannot stress enough that I am just as unhappy as I must imagine you all are to see the shirts culminate this way. CT has moved well over 250 shirts as of now, and unfortunately the same process that can create excellent quality shirts (screen printing) can also create errors, since it is done by humans, not machines.

**Again, If anyone else receives any CT shirt with any error, please, absolutely feel free to PM me, message us on FB, or ask on Tumblr, and I will do my best to fix the issue as quick as possible.** Although normally there is a only a small minority of shirts with defects, the vast majority of the shirts are printed perfectly. 

This is really a personal endeavor for me- while CT is now endorsed by Clash Tournaments, I still personally maintain and run almost the entirety of the line, from the start of a design to when it gets to you. I am running CT because I really do love Smash Bros, and I also love design. Bringing those two things together makes me happy- there's nothing like stumbling upon a group picture from a tournament where someone is wearing one of my shirts. :) When errors like the above happen, it is both unlucky and sad- nothing would have made me happier than for my design to have made someone else happy. I'm very sorry that didn't happen, and I hope CT hasn't lost you as a customer.

*EDIT: I also want to give credit where it's due- my amazing girlfriend has helped enormously with input, advice, and helping me manage the social functions of CT. Also, Mark Korsak, of Clash Tournaments, has been an enormous help, professionally.*

*EDIT 2:* ***If you want to help:*** *If you received a misprint, please message support@teespring.com, and explain that you received a misprinted shirt. The key is not to be mean to the printers, but to express that we actually wanted these shirts- hopefully, by showing enough support, they will do a reprint, so that everyone can receive not just refunds but also proper shirts to be proud of.*"	t5_2qiep	True

Basically, just ask anything about SSB, no matter how silly you think it is, and it will be answered!
Perhaps you have a small question but didn't think it warranted an entire topic? Post it here! However, it could be any question that might lead into a massive discussion; it doesn't necessarily have to be a teeny question!

An example of a question might be:

&gt;What is the difference between NTSC Falco and PAL Falco?

To which the answer would be:

* Falco's [PAL] down aerial only spikes for the first half of the animation. The rest sends the opponent slightly up.
* Fox can tech out of Falco's down throw in PAL.

Since then I have worked to fully customize Project M, adding a custom skin to replace every color of every character. I even replaced a few of the stages. 

I noticed a posts about texture modding have been popping up on this sub lately and they made me want to share my customized Project M with a community that could really appreciate it. So, here is a download link to the mod for you all to enjoy: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoloa7j6l5can3z/Kyletheguy%27s%20Project%20M.zip

It's super easy to install (same as the regular hackless version of [Project M](http://projectmgame.com/en/download)). Just follow the instructions on the included readme and you'll be set.

Of course, I claim no rights to any of the contents of this mod. Project M is the property of the amazing modders at [projectmgame.com](projectmgame.com) and the textures belong to various users at [BrawlVault](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php).

Please let me know in the comments if you find any glitches or have any questions. Happy smashing!


Edit: A lot of you guys want to see some screenshots before you try this out and I totally get that. I wouldn't want to blindly download something like this either. I don't have time to put any together tonight, but I'll try to get some screen shots up tomorrow. They won't be particularly high quality - just pics of my tv - but they'll get the point across.
Edit Edit: ...or I could just use the snapshot function that's built into the game to get amazing quality shots. That works too :p

Also, th3shark uploaded the readme that has a list of all of the skins right [here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=VK9jzeBQ) and mmhawk607 posted a bunch of screen shots. Thanks to both of you. As I said, I will be posting a whole bunch of screenshots later, but right now I need to go to work. 


LAST EDIT: Well, turns out that if you get too much download traffic on dropbox, they suspend your account. The link that I posted here no longer works, so I hope that everyone that got a chance to download it has fun. Otherwise, I'm sorry if I got anyone's hopes up. If I can find another way to upload the file, I'll make another post and share it again (I'll be sure to add pics next time). If anyone knows of a good/cheap way to share files over 400mb in size, please let me know. "	t5_2qiep	True

But I was curious as to how many people still play SSB64 with the same kind of vigor that modern day Melee players reach.


IMO the fact that the grab is as fast as it is makes it a very clever game of rock paper scissors. You aren't royally penalized for missing a grab like in every other version (unless your samus, yoshi, or link), so the action is almost always faster pace.

Without having a mid-air dodge, you can still deflect most non Bomb Items with a precise attack or shield bump in the right direction. (This being supplemented with an air dodge in melee, and a catch feature in brawl)


I live in Northern California and me and my friends have been competitively smashing SSB64 for the past 4 years or so. I was curious if there was a 64 scene around here at all. We'd love to test our might against some other players.

So it sounds like updates more akin to the old Dojo are still a possibility (albeit much less frequently released, it seems). Is that how my fellow Smashers are interpreting this? We've already seen a significant reveal with Olimar, but I take this to mean we may have the occasional post about new items, stages, etc. with a little more depth than just a picture and a caption. If that's the case, I'm very encouraged!

Larger reveals seemed inevitable as the months went on, but with this post, I think we can expect some beefier updates sooner rather than later."	t5_2qiep	True
1373875265.0	1ibt8x	Post EVO reminder for interested players	NMWShrieK	46	7	2	The best way to get involved in the competitive community is to follow the links under community resources on the right side.  Regional Facebook groups and SmashBoards are the best way to find local players.  The competitive community can be quite insular at times--not in that they aren't welcoming of good players, but that new players aren't sought out enough.  I hope you all enjoyed Evo as much as I did.  Ultimately, the goal of Evo was to get our community exposure.  So I hope you interested players who aren't yet part of the competitive scene will show up to tournaments and continue to help sustain our wonderful community.	t5_2qiep	True

The connection here is made by two very strong and obvious data points. This is because Olimar 1) was released right on the Japanese Pikmin 3 release, and 2) because he has a link to the Pikmin 3 website at the bottom of his character page on [smashbros.com.](http://www.smashbros.com/us/characters/pikmin.html)  This also applies to Luigi except with [Mario and Luigi: Dream Team](http://www.smashbros.com/us/characters/luigi.html). 

Edit:Villager was also revealed within a week of his game being released in the U.S, giving even more evidence to support a trend I'm predicting. He does not have a link to his game in his website, and he was revealed along several other characters at E3, which is why he wasn't included in the original post.

I think that in the coming months we can expect to see the reveal of several other characters to promote their games that are coming out. People are saying that Yoshi not having been revealed yet is fishy. Did you know that he has a game coming out [soon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_7?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=yoshi's%20new%20island&amp;sprefix=yoshi's%2Caps%2C208)? He'll probably be confirmed around the release date of his game to promote that. Other characters that make sense to be revealed soon are Puff(more likely) or Mewtwo/Newtwo(less likely) for the worldwide release of X and Y in October; Zelda or maybe even Toon Link (I know it's unlikely, but it is a handheld game) for a link between worlds in November; Diddy Kong for Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze; Peach for Super Mario 3DWorld; and maybe even Sonic for his Nintendo exclusive Sonic: Lost World.

 This still leaves Captain Falcon and Ness, although they've been perfect attendance secret characters, so I won't lose any sleep over them having not been revealed yet.

TL;DR
Nintendo is using it's strongest franchise to add a little hype to its game's releases. Just check the bottom of Luigi and Olimar's character pages in the website for links to their upcoming games and notice the reveal date of the character and it is quite obvious."	t5_2qiep	True

What you will require:
roughly 2 beers per person and Super Smash Bros.

How To Play:
Start a game.
This can be played with both stock and time, they are just slightly different.
Every time you die, once you leave the screen you start drinking. This means as soon as your bubble disappears. So, if your character if flying off into the sunset, you should be drinking during that time.
Continue to drink until your character falls off their platform
(you still have a couple seconds of invincibility to drop your beer and grab your controller)
If you forget and jump off your platform without drinking, you must drink for five seconds. During this time you are exposed to attack, but you can use the joystick for evasion.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STOCK AND TIME:
If you are eliminated from a stock game then you must drink with the other players when any of them die."	t5_2qiep	True

*Black, Navy T-Shirt: $16*

*Black, Navy Hoodie: $26.50*

*Navy Tank Top: $17*

Since the Captain Falcon shirt campaign reached its goal, I am going to go ahead and start releasing the other designs! I am pleased to announce that the the first up is the heavily requested Falco!

The shirts will run for much longer than before, giving you and others more time to buy. However, because Captain Falcon was by far the most popular in all of the polls, I expect other characters to sell less. Because of this, the campaign goals are lower, and the price is higher by just $1. I hope this will not be too much of a change. 

I plan to have several designs going at once, usually with ~2 new designs premiering at the same time. I will hopefully be able to introduce a 2nd new design soon, to sell alongside Falco. I also plan to introduce new waves of designs every 1-1.5 weeks, so there'll be plenty for everyone! As always, thank you all so much for your support. It's been really amazing getting the chance to do something I love for the community I spend my time in! Here's to a great EVO!

I've recently developed a livestream listing on the sidebar to check what livestreams are currently live, and it updates every 15-20 minutes. It works exactly like /r/tf2 in case you want another example.

What this does is, you enter your twitch.tv username into the ""Contact Details"" portion of your Smashboards account. Your twitch.tv username is then tied to your profile. Every 15-20 minutes, our crawler will scan for Smash streams with the game set on your twitch.tv page as ""Super Smash Bros."", ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"", ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl"" or the name of the 4th Smash game when it is released.

Not only does this go on the front page of [Smashboards](http://www.smashboards.com/), but it will also be tweeted automatically to our [@ssblivestreams](http://www.twitter.com/ssblivestreams) twitter feed. If you want to give that a follow to get notifications on your twitter feed for Smash streams, go right ahead!

(Please be aware, if you link your twitch.tv username to your Smashboards profile, and you are either repeatedly setting your twitch.tv game in your dashboards to Smash but not streaming it, or just purposefully doing something malicious with it, the stream will be removed from the list. Thanks.)

I want to let you know that this can be fixed with very small changes that can drastically step up your game not only against new people, but also with new challenges and technical skills!




First we need to focus on the biggest problem: You.
You might not realize it, but it is very possible that the biggest problem with your progression is yourself, this can be due to how to react to certain things like new opponents, challenges (tech,timing,spacing) , and of course the biggest one of all...DEFEAT. 



I remember when i reacted harsh on myself all the time because i couldn't get that wavedash to come out of shield, or that up smash out of wavedash, or even falling for the same read over and over again; it really got depressing. [This Guide](http://www.smashboards.com/threads/fluxwolfs-guide-to-stepping-up-your-game-mental-strategies-v1-0.129236/#post-3424953) by [FluxWolf](http://smashboards.com/members/fluxwolf.48178/) helped me out in so many ways on dealing with all of those things. 



After reading it for the first time i decided i had nothing to loose, i gave it a shot and to my surprise it really worked! I was calm all the time, all my moves came out, everything seemed to fit together, and it all just felt like second nature; i was making a big deal out of my results and put myself down for it every time, this only made me play worse and worse to the point that i got mad and had to put down the controller and just go for a walk. I know this is a long read and i apologize; its my first post on this subreddit and i hope it helps you as much as it helped me.

PLEASE give it a read, i know its long but trust me it is worth it!



TL;DR: Your attitude reflects greatly on your performance, like it or not. So it is in your best interest to face new challenges with a positive attitude; You can do this!

##The Past

Started off innocently enough with just a Facebook poll.  There many games listed there, including the serious FGC flagship titles and other...not-so-serious titles.  One of the games listed happened to be Super Smash Bros. Melee.

I'm not too sure how it took off.  Some smashers shared the link around saying stuff like ""hey, wouldn't it be cool if Melee got into EVO""?  So it spread around, slowly but surely gaining momentum.  I will say that when I voted for it, I had no idea what was going to come next.

Someone made a smashboards post about it.  It EXPLODED.  A giant organized effort came from smashers sharing the link every which way asking all of their smasher friends to vote for it until Melee was not only in 1st place, but that it absolutely **dominated** the Facebook poll.  IIRC, we managed to double the votes of the runnerups, which includes easily recognizable games such as SF4 and UMVC3 (though obviously, they didn't even need to be in the poll to be in EVO lol).

The poll never guaranteed entry into EVO though.  Perhaps with how overwhelming the community response was to the poll though, Mr. Wizard and whoever else works with him must've taken some interest in it.  As such, after announcing 7 games in the lineup for EVO, he also announced that an *eighth* game would also be chosen: the one who donated the most to a breast cancer reasearch donation fund.

In the early days of the donation fund, efforts were somewhat lackluster.  One thing that many smashers had trouble dealing was the fact that My Little Pony: Fighting is Magic was dominating the early stages of the donation fund.  It seemed hopeless: MLP fans were known for being huge on charity and they seemed to have an almost of surmountable lead of $5k (lol) that was exponentially growing compared to Melee's measly $2k.

However, issues came up with the fact that Fighting is Magic was not even a fully developed game.  The developers themselves urged their fans to vote for other games and Mr. Wizard removed the game from the lineup, instead offering it an exhibition position if it still managed to win the donation drive.  Needless to say though, support for it drastically waned.

Melee started taking off, but it was closely followed by another surprise competitor; I probably wouldn't be the first to say I was surprised to see *Skullgirls* take to the ring as our main competitor.

It became a back-and-forth struggle, and every day was spent just trying to one-up the other for donations in both communities.  Both communities organized donation events, donation incentives, and more to garner as much money as possible, and both communities planned decisive snipes at the very last moments of the donation drive.

Close to the end of the donation drive, both communities remained stagnant in their donation drives, both Melee and Skullgirls in the $30k range.  Possibly the biggest surprise was seeing *Street Fighter II Turbo* suddenly jump to $33k in one night, establishing themselves as a potentially threatening new rival!  Though it later turns out that was all they could really muster.

The night of the donation drive was probably the most tense.  Melee had a stream podcast called *Melee it on Me* where they organized one last effort to crush the donation drive.  Skullgirls had their own stream where the developer and the voice-actors themselves were getting involved in organizing community effort.  On that day, donations flooded in from both communities, upwards $60k before the sniping happened.

From my personal experience watching it, I remember watching Skullgirls reach $72k and lost some hope.  Even after the main announcement for the ""Spirit Bomb"", we were still in the $60k range!  Where were those thousands of dollards supposed to come from?

Didn't have to wait long for the explosion to really happen.  Somewhat losing hope, I refreshed Melee's page indicating it's donation numbers.  $75k?  That put us in the lead!  I refreshed again.  $80k!  Holy shit, Melee is bringing in the big money.  When the numbers reached the $90k range, I shit myself and spent the rest of the minutes leading up the end of the donation drive screaming, whooping, and hollering for joy.

It was a great day for Melee that day.  A great day for anyone who loves Smash, really.

##The Present

In just one week leading up to EVO, Nintendo made a shocking decision and ordered a cease-and-desist to EVO in regards to streaming Melee at EVO.

This outraged countless people.  For Smashers, it was a heavy blow.  Many were hoping for Melee get large amounts of exposure at EVO, hopefully garnering more widespread interest in the competitive Smash community.  Many others just wanted to see their favorite top players duke it out in the biggest Smash tournament to date.  It was a huge backhand to the Smash community.

Competitive smashers were not the only ones who saw injustice in this decision.  Countless others, regardless of even whether they appreciated Smash or not, saw this as one of the most beloved video game companies in history betraying one of their most loyal fanbases.  The organized effort to overturn Nintendo's decision was overwhelming.

In a matter of *hours*, Nintendo decided to revoke their decision.  Thank Nintendo for the quick response.  Thank people outside the smash community for showing support regardless of their thoughts on competitive smash.  And thank the community, for being so passionate and so thoughtful of the game that has brought them all together.

##The Future

EVO is upon us.  For all those going to compete in the bracket, good luck in all of your matches, and try your hardest no matter what.

For those streaming not-top-8, go out there and grab some good matches!  EVO is the largest smash tournament in history, so there will be PLENTY of matches that would make any stream-viewer's pants wet.

For the stream-watchers, have fun watching the best players the world has to offer duke it out for supremacy.

@Everyone, get hype.

What upsets do you think might happen?

* Who wants to see XYZ as a playable character in SSB4?
* Check out this moveset I created for XYZ!
* Wouldn't XYZ be an awesome feature to have in SSB4?
  
This is still only the second iteration of these ""official"" discussion threads, so let us know how this is going.

I felt that being able to unlock everyone in subspace emmisary was convenient, but also a big step down from the challenge of unlocking them in the first two games. So what I was thinking was they could have unlockable skins, which would work like Wario in Brawl on the character select screen. This could allow them to have Twilight Princess Link and Skyward Sword Link, Dr. Mario back as a skin for Mario, different power suits for Samus, and all kinds of cool stuff. Plenty of opportunity for fan-catering and whatnot.

 So I imagine these unlockables would be pretty desirable (or at least more desirable than trophies and music), and we could bring back some of the challenge (and replay value) that way."	t5_2qiep	True

Basically, you have a copy of the tier list. Each player selects a character from the lowest tier, and plays a match. Winner keeps the stock like a crew battle, loser selects a character from the next highest tier, and continues, until someone loses with a top tier character.

We played the teams version, which was insanely fun. Kirby swallowciding my teammate's actual tertiary Bowser while my Pichu traded usmash with opponent Ness's sweetspot bair and both of us died.

It's interesting when my partner's main is top tier and mine is mid tier. We went Samus Ganon in preparation to counterpick our opponent's inevitable Ice Climbers(you have to play Ice Climbers at one point), and then lost our entire lead when we were forced to go double Ice Climbers against Peach Falcon.

I recommend trying this in any game, I'm sure Brawl would be fun with the increased number of tiers, it's a great way to play with people who enjoy using secondaries across many tiers."	t5_2qiep	True

1365361030.0	1bv73h	Playing Melee/Brawl at 60fps with no lag &amp; not interlaced at 30hz	ShortFuse	41	6	15	"Let's get this out of the way, LCD/LED monitors have lag and even if you find an LCD monitor with low response rate, monitor still needs to upconvert the 480p signal to whatever its native resolution is (720p/768p/1080p).

CRT TVs only output at one refresh rate and are interlaced. 480i. That's interlaced. This means you are, in fact, seeing only full frames 30 per second. The pre 2004 GameCubes and Wiis have the component connection. Now, it is very hard to find gamecube component cables, but if you have one, you're in luck. If not, you have to use your Wii with component connection.

To achieve a lagless 60fps 480p display, you need something capable of displaying at 480p. Now, LCD monitors can do this and HDTVs, but we know the terrible lag they can have.

The solution actually comes from old CRT computer monitors. They will display at 480p with no upscaling needed. There is a factor of converting the component YPbPr to RGBHV. Any other conversion will resort in a DAC which will incur latency. This is basically converting Component RCA to VGA DSub. If you are handy with a soldering icon, you can extract the H and V signals from the GameCube cable (link later) but if not, a component to VGA adapter would do the trick. ~$40-$100.

But I will say this, once you play in 480p, you will never go back.

GameCube Component to RGBHV :

While using Mario, if you use the c-stick to smash in the opposite direction your facing, he takes an extra step for added range. If you smash in the opposite direction using the ""over-A"" method, he wont take the extra step.

2. You can tilt bowser's and charizards head while using their fire breath. It just never occurred to me to try i guess, even though it seems obvious now.

3. You are suppose to press B to easily end the air glide that pit and charizard can do. Again, seems obvious now.

4. You can pick up snake's box and throw it during his taunt.

5. I just discovered this one yesterday: sometimes electrode wont explode when he comes out, he just makes a sad face and goes away. this one took me by surprise so much that i goggled it. it happens, but its really rare.

I just think its awesome how this game can be pretty old and im still finding new things about it.

Id love to learn more if anyone else has any interesting bits of knowledge from ANY of the smash games.

1365264042.0	1bstj3	An updated Project M comprehensive stage build (77 stages + many improvements)	Garbagehead4	36	6	29	"Hello, r/smashbros, I'm back with an updated version of my Project M 2.5b comprehensive stage build! There were a number of issues with the original version that I wanted to get sorted out as soon as possible. The end result is a build that has a much cleaner, professional feel to it, as well as better stages overall. 
This is also a great place to get started if you're new to Project M; I've arranged the download so that anyone with an 2GB SD card and a Wii can start from scratch. No homebrew, prerequisite installations, or code modifying required.

There is a very fine line between an annoying stage and an endearing one -- the latter of which all 77 stages included can ideally lay claim to. That said, this does NOT mean every stage must be 'neutral'. The goal of this build is to seek balance and quality in the stage selection. If every stage were akin to Smashville or FD, quality stages as they are, it would make for an extremely boring game. All of the [stages from version 1.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1aoegg/a_comprehensive_project_m_stage_build_77_stages/) are included, unless otherwise noted below in the change list. Enjoy!


**This build is designed around Project M version 2.5b (no wifi) (Hackless Wii)**


Riivolution and Dolphin users: You're on your own with this one, I have no knowledge of how this will work with them :P

**REASONS TO DOWNLOAD:**

If you want a cumulative collection of stages from the entire Smash series, and then some (77 total). It's like the greatest hits album of stages, plus new remixes and unreleased content. Version 2.0 now has a cleaner interface and better quality overall, so if you downloaded 1.0 this would be a great time to upgrade. This build is perfect if you typically choose your stages manually and aren't planning to use your copy of Project M in a tournament. Lastly, if you're a complete n00b to Project M, this is a great opportunity to get started.

**REASONS TO NOT DOWNLOAD:**

If random stage selection and stage striking are critical to your gameplay. Both of these options still have issues. Many of the preview images on the stage select screen are of low resolution to prevent freezing; if the low quality bothers you, it probably isn't a good idea to download. If you have a ton of custom content already and don't want to go through the hassle of sorting it out, download as you see fit.

**DOWNLOAD OPTION #1**


1. Download the .rar file: https://rapidshare.com/files/3508877620/PMStageBuild2.0.rar (approx. 600MB)
2. If the download link is unavailable, try download option #2.
3. Extract all the files to an empty 2 GB SD card.
4. Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already, load up stage builder, and enjoy.


**DOWNLOAD OPTION #2**


1. Download the .rar file: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1XVf-zdlELwbDJRWEhMUnBoQUE/edit (approx. 600MB)
2. Extract all the files to an empty 2 GB SD card.
3. Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already, load up stage builder, and enjoy.

**STAGE LIST**

[Go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1aoegg/a_comprehensive_project_m_stage_build_77_stages/) to see what stages are included. All are the same unless indicated in the change list below.


**CHANGE LIST**

* Metal Harbor Shipdeck has been replaced with a neutralized Spear Pillar. The Shipdeck's novelty was good and all, considering I'm a big SA2 fan, but it needed to go. The blast zones were enormous, and the plain stage design made it feel anything but unique. The other metal harbor stage was kept because the staggered platforms led to more interesting matches. Therefore, I replaced the Shipdeck with a much less annoying Spear Pillar. The floor of the 'basement' is entirely fall through, so as to discourage camping and insanely high damage percentages. Also, Pokemon do not appear at random and kill you, unlike the Spear pillar in Brawl. The BRSTM for Spear pillar is the Pokemon theme song (season 1).
* Sector Z has been replaced with [SSE: Halberd Interior](http://i367.photobucket.com/albums/oo113/EternalYoshi/al_091208_1249binout.jpg). Sector Z is essentially a slightly larger version of Corneria; it didn't make much sense to have two nearly identical stages. The interesting platform layout of Halberd Interior should make for better matches in the long run. The BRSTM for Halberd Interior is: [Tyven - Seven Lions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pyrMpHWClY)
* Final Destination 64 has been replaced with [Castlevania: Clock Tower](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=9235). The physical layout of the stages is very similar, so there weren't any sweeping changes here. While the Clock Tower is visaully more appealing, its Lylat Cruise-esque ledge can be a problem from time to time. 
* Super Smash Land: Underground has been replaced with [Super Smash Land: Dr. Wily's Castle](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=30930). Underground was removed because it was a cramped and awkward stage to fight on. Dr. Wily's Castle retains a unique platform layout while allowing adequate breathing room. **THIS STAGE IS FOR 2-PLAYER MATCHES ONLY** There seems to be a glitch with certain characters spawning on this stage. Characters will die randomly at the start of a 3 or 4 player match. This can be alleviated by using the stock control option for players 3 and 4.
* The Temple of Time and Super Smash Land have been swapped on the stage select screen. This was done so that characters would appear 3D in the Temple, and 2D in Smash Land. The converse was the case in version 1.0, which didn't make much sense. The Megaman music is now paired with its proper stage. 
* Fourside has been reverted to its original (Melee) form. There are plenty of other stages in this build that have been 'neutralized', and Fourside didn't really need to be. This brings up once again the dispute between 'endearing' and 'annoying'. Fourside was not neutral while at the same time it was rarely annoying. By reviving the original Fourside, I feel that it adds to the overall variety of this build without sacrificing quality.
* Skyworld has been reverted to its original texture. The dark texture made the platforms a bit harder to see. On top of that, I thought the texture was bland and added nothing to the stage. If you want the dark texture back, feel free to find it on BrawlVault.

* WarioWare has also been reverted to its original texture. The villains background was too distracting.

* The Bulborb on Distant Planet is now friendly and will no longer eat you.

* Stage names on the stage select screen (SSS) have been corrected and uniform in appearance. ""Whirlpool Islands"" has been corrected to ""The Whirl Islands"", ""Sonic Casino Zone"" has been corrected to ""Techno Base Zone"", and unnecessary ""Beta"" subtitle was removed from Brinstar Depths. ""Chibi-Robo"" has been changed to ""Chibi-Robo Living Room"". All names are now the same font and size, greatly improving the appearance of the SSS.
* Icons on the SSS have been redone for maximum clarity and their borders are now uniform in appearance. Some of the icons in version 1.0 were blurry and/or had a darker border, all resolutions were optimized and all issues were fixed. SSE: Jungle now has the proper icon and preview for its Tallon Overworld texture.
* Preview images display only the stages. Certain images depicted characters on the stage in version 1.0, these have been airbrushed out. The icon and preview image for Mushroom Kingdom now has the walkoff ledges removed. 
* In-game music titles have been added wherever possible. Certain titles were impossible to add, because the sound file replaced was not in-game music to begin with. For example, the music that normally plays during the game over screen was replaced with Peach's Castle 64 (Z51). The game over file was never meant to be played during a match, therefore it doesn't have an in-game music title. When a match is started with one of these 'titleless' songs, the title simply displays a musical eighth-note and nothing else. If anyone knows how to manually add these titles in, I'd love to know.

* Menu 1 (X02) has been replaced with: [Stand Up - The Prodigy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w86qjdBnaQ) ( aka the Project M 'theme song')
* Castlevania music has been added to Dracula's Castle (Replacing Luigi's Mansion Theme).
* The BRSTM for Yoshi's Island (Melee) has been changed to: [Levels (Super Mario World Remix) - Avicii](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_apb7EcsWgc) 
* The volume of the Vs. Red BRSTM on Mewtwo's Stadium has been lowered to a tolerable level.
* The BRSTM for Whirl Islands has been replaced with: [Pika Girl - DJ S3RL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCrLMwDz5qE)
* The BRSTM for Battlefield Ver. 2 has been changed to [Super Mario 64 - Devastation's Doorway (OC remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD8z2liq9ok)
* Mona's Pizza JP has been changed to Gangnam Style
* Mike's Song JP has been changed to What Is Love?

**PROBLEMS AND HELP**

If there are any problems with the build or the download, please let me know in the comments! If you have any questions regarding importing stages, BRSTMs, SSS modifications, or in-game music titles, feel free to ask.

Not all the stages are perfect; if there's some that are a chore to play on, let me know! Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
