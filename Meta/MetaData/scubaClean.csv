RunDogRun2006	96	11	35	"After two separate attempts to get the open water certification and either my work schedule or the weather not co-operating, I have finally been certified in open water diving and wanted to share this achievement.  Next step is to choose a place to go diving, preferably in the Caribbean that's also a fairly economic choice.  Any suggestions?  I was kinda thinking Roatan

edit:
Thank you everyone for the advice and for being excited for me.  Yes, I am from the states and have heard about most of the places that have been suggested but didn't really think about most of them for my choice destination.  Also, big thanks to those of you who also suggested dives that would be easy for a beginner.  I forgot to think that like most everything, scuba diving has different levels of difficulty and what might be good for a advanced diver may not be so friendly for a beginner.
I can't wait to go diving in a warm place unlike the quarry I did my certifications dives in."	t5_2qhii	True

Remember your rediquette, and don't reveal any identifying information. 

1)Where you're from, (City, Province/State, Country),
2)What level diver are you, 
3)How long you have been diving, and approx how many dives do you have under your belt,

I'll start
1)Where are you from? **Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada**
2)What level diver are you? **Advanced Open Water**
3)How long you have been diving, and approx how many dives do you have under your belt? **Been diving for almost 5 years, and have somewhere between 120-150 dives to my name**

Hopefully once we've got some data, one of those clever internet kids can even slap together an infographic map or something...

1327304939.0	osmxm	Lost a friend this weekend.	skoorbevad	52	7	16	"One of my best friends passed unexpectedly in his bed on early Saturday morning.  He was a long time caver and cave diver who introduced me to each one -- kicking and screaming.

He got me into SCUBA after having explored dry caves with him for a while.  I told him there was no way in hell I would ever dive into a cave, but he had a way of getting you hooked on some new hobby without you realizing it until it was too late.  My friend and I started diving back in the middle of 2009 with the goal in mind of acquiring enough experience and training to one day be able to cave dive with him -- we had a three man team that trusted each other.

My friend and I were just two months away from completing out NAUI Cave I certification and making that happen.  He was going to take off work and make it down to Florida and do the dives with us.  We were all looking forward to it.

Now, we'll never be able to do that.  His death is wrenching on me for a number of reasons, but that one just rises to the top every time.  We were so close, and he was so excited to get to do that with us.

I haven't spoken with my other diver friend about diving since the news this weekend obviously, that's the last thing on our minds... but I hope he doesn't fizzle out.  I know just hanging up the tanks would be the last thing Chris wanted.  We want to put a few of his ashes in the back of one of his favorite caves.

Just had to share that, it won't really mean anything to anybody here I'm sure, but typing it out helps.

Here's a non-diving-related picture I snapped of him one day at the bottom of Neversink, which is a giant 162-ft. open air pit in Jackson County, Alabama (like I said, we got our roots in dry caving): http://i.imgur.com/dKtPx.jpg"	t5_2qhii	True

Well one dive around an artificial reef we ran into another group from the same dive centre being led by a DM called Jackie. The site was mostly macro stuff so most of what we were looking at was pretty tiny. At one point i was watching Sookie and Jackie called her over. He pointed to something tiny on a piece of submerged wood, I was too far away to see what he was pointing at and evidently it was so small that Sookie couldn't see it either. She looked at him puzzled. Jackie was pretty insistent so she looked closer and closer till her face was inches away from where he was pointing but she still couldn't see it. When her face was almost touching the wood he slowly retracted his second finger and extended his middle one so he was flipping her the bird from about an inch away from her face. When she realised what he'd done she drew back and started beating him around the head and shoulders with her metal pointing stick while he laughed hysterically. Her furious expression and his absolute joy had me laughing so hard I nearly spat out my reg.	t5_2qhii	True

In 1976, Montreal hosted the Olympic games.  The city build a brand new stadium with several pools in it.  One of those pools is designed for scuba diving.

The indoor pool consists of three tiers.  One at every 15 feet.  The bottom of the pool is 45ft deep.  It is one of the deepest of its kind in North America.  We dive there during the winter, when it's often too cold outside, or to test out new gear.  It's also used for police training.

Late last year, we found out from a posting on the city's website, that the pool is closing to make room for 2 (more) gymnasiums.

It would mean a lot to the Montreal diving community for this pool to stay open.  If you can, please sign the petition over here: https://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-3467/index.html

1333914773.0	rzm9d	My friend passed away Thursday, rebreather accident. r/scuba, I could really use your help.	veilside000	37	1	34	"Hey Divers,

My buddy Ryan was a commercial diver and scuba instructor, was working in Bermuda at a diveshop, and was testing out a new closed-circuit rebreather when he had an accident and passed away.


A few pieces of information have come in, mostly from [news reports](http://bermudasun.bm/m/Articles.aspx?ArticleID=57838) , that say he was in shallow water (9 feet/4 meters) and that he was in close proximity to the shore.


I've been trying to comb the internet to find an explanation for how this could have happened... how rebreather accidents are only prevalent in shallow water... as well as shedding light on how he could have had an accident with brand new equipment.


I've heard from several people that rebreathers kill, that they're dangerous, and without proper training they can be deadly. By many accounts Ryan had received ample training on rebreathers but I'm not sure if this was his first time using one.



So r/scuba, with your knowledge, I was wondering if you give me some insight on what could have gone wrong, what he was possibly experiencing down there, and any other cases/incidents that you could relate this to. Myself and my friends are quite in rough shape, we've lost a pretty awesome dude, and this would mean a lot if I could get some more information about how I lost a friend.



Thanks everyone, any help would be greatly appreciated.

1370943288.0	1g40rb	My single wierdest story. Enjoy /r/scuba.	Superplaner	38	7	18	"Back when I was 20 I was working as a Diving Instructor in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt. I was a sweet gig, diving in low labour cost countries always is, none of the hard work, all of the fun. In May a lovely family comes on a daytrip on the boat I'm working on, Father is an avid diver, mother isn't, two daughter only just learned to dive, all super-nice people though.

I guess they had a good time with me because they left me a hefty tip. The next morning (supposedly my day off) my boss calls me. Says I have to work, I'm doing a privete liveaboard with guests who requested me personally. This was a sweet deal, our center had a system where if you did a good enough job to be requested personally, there was an extra €50/day in it for you.

I get down to the center to find my lovely guests from the day before waiting for me along with a collegue of mine who will also be coming along (we never did liveaboards with only one instructor in case of sickness etc). They're all payed up for a 5 day trip, private boat, private instructor, the whole nine yards.

They were staying for two weeks so we weren't leaving until the next day. I spend some time with them planning a route, suggesting some dives that are out of reach of the normal day trips and checking out if they have any special requests. Other than asking me if I can get some alcohol on board, nothing special. I spend the rest of the day packing shit and raiding the hotel fridge for booze. 

The trip itself was rather uneventful, had some awsome dives like a night and subsequent dawn dive on the SS Thistlegorm, did a nitrox course with them and saw some beautiful feather tails and reef sharks. We get back the they insist I come to dinner with them, this isn't too unusual so I tag along. Here's where shit started going south. 

After dinner we met up with some of my collegues at the Camel Bar. Mike(it's Mike, right? It's been ten years) the bartender made some cocktails and everyone got reasonably drunk. At some point their parents headed home but the daughters stayed. I think I might have promised to bring them back to the hotel safe and sound. Not long after this, my memory gets very fuzzy. I remember one of my collegues suggesting we hit the casino and not much after that.

I woke up slowly. My back hurt like a motherfucker and I felt absolutely terrible. Sun is rising over the sea. It takes me several second to realize that I can't see the sea from my bed. I'm watching the sun rise because I'm not actually in my bed. I am in a sun bed with the younger daugther from the night before and I have no idea where the fuck I am. I've worked in Sharm for a while. I know the beaches around town and the hotels. This isn't one of them. I am also barefoot, I know this because my feet are ice cold. Barefoot and in a tuxedo.

We get up and I gather, after some initial confusion and awkwardness, that we took a cab, no she doesn't know where. Big help that is. In my pockets I have two cheeseburgers from McDonalds, a few 1€ tokens, about €50 in cash and a receipt for a rented tux. At least that explains the fucking tuxedo. I walk up to the hotel and finally realize that we aren't actually in Sharm, we're in fucking Dahab, about 100 kms north of Sharm. I borrow the phone at the front desk and call my boss. Might as well come clean. He laughs and says he'll send someone to pick me up ones the drivers have picked up the guests. While we wait we have breakfast at the hotel and I apologize profusely, trying to convince her not to have her father fucking murder me (as I probably would had it been my daughter). She's surprisingly chill about the whole thing.

Eventually my collegue Amer picks us up and drives us back to the center in Sharm where my boss and her family are waiting. After more profuse apologies, they send me home to sleep it off. I have to ask the landlord to unlock my door because I have no clue where my keys, clothes, phone or wallet is. That mystery is soon resolved, they're spread all over my living room. I change out of the tux and shower. As I go in to my room I notice that something is off. On the bed is a hefty chunk of cash, to be precise, there's 2181€ there along with a receipt from the casino. Apparently I was lucky. There's also a pair of very small red panties there and two used condoms. Apparently I had sex, presumably with my lady for the evening. 

My shoes and socks are nowhere to be found. In the next few days, I pieced things together with the help of my coworkers. Apparently we weren't allowed in the casino because of the dresscode so in my drunken wisdom, I went and found a tailor, payed him extra to open up the shop, rent me a tux and went back. I won close to 3000€ but apparently blew nearly 1000 on taxis, drinks and... yes, McDonalds. Then I got in a cab and asked him to drive me to the Paradise Hotel rather than Paradise resorts. When asked if I was really sure and if I knew that Paradise Hotel was in Dahab I was apparently adamant about it.

1352524021.0	12y9wh	Anyone have any questions about diving with a rebreather?	sirket	32	6	43	"I recently got my rebreather certification and while no expert- I figured I would answer questions if anyone is interested.

Edit: Wow- I was not expecting so much interest.

Let me add some more information:

First off- diving with a rebreather is a bit weird. It's quiet. Like really quiet. You can hear other rebreather divers talking because it's so quiet. You can hear the mushroom valves in the mouthpiece opening and closing it's so quiet. Fish aren't scared of you. Sometimes they just sort of swim up to you and stare because you aren't making any bubbles to scare them away.

Second- buoyancy control is a pain in the ***. All the awesome buoyancy control you develop as an open circuit diver goes right out the window. When you inhale or exhale- the total air volume doesn't change. It either goes into your lungs from the counter-lungs, or into the counter-lungs from your lungs. Ascending or descending requires adding or removing air from your BCD (or dry suit) and/or swimming up or down. It's a very strange feeling. That said- once you get below about 40 feet the pressure difference becomes small enough that you can hover effortlessly. These units really shine between 60 and 100 feet though."	t5_2qhii	True

We dived a heap of wrecks and reefs over a week from a liveaboard.  Boat was awesome, great cabins, food, people, facilities...   The motorbike/car photos are from the SS Thistlegorm - bombed by the Germans with a full load of cargo.

This is known as one of the more rigorous sci diving programs on the west coast (only definitively second after Humbolt). The class consisted of 4 full days in the pool, 10 training dives, and then 6 final dives as a practical. The practical took place in one of the few accessible spots in big sur, where we camped and dived for 4 days. The final two dives took data that are going into a long-term dataset for the area. In addition to our normal gear, we had to carry a 30cmx30cm quadrat, a meter bar, a 30m meter tape, and a 10 foot chain. This all had to be clipped off while we crawled through endless piles of merciless giant kelp, and then we had to work through a thick understory of Pterogophyra once we got to the bottom. 

Next week, I am starting some work for a local graduate student to do seagrass transplant experiments in a local estuary. We will be diving in low-vis waters, running transcects and transplanting seagrasses. 

If anybody has any questions about scientific diving, and the taskloading it includes, feel free to ask! Here's a picture of our [dive class](http://imgur.com/wcHrZXi), I'm fifth from the right with the tall hair and blue jacket. "	t5_2qhii	True

* Commercial Diver

Here are the rules:

1. You can only have one icon at a time
2. Dive Instructors **MUST** Prove their status by messaging the mods with either an image of their certification or a link and information to validate.
3. We know that some of the nitrox colored flag based icons are pre-reqs for the certs they adhere to, but wanted to give options to the users. 

We will be adding more icons in the future that will be available to all divers those icons currently include; Shipwrecks, Wetsuit, Tanks, Sharks, Turtles, cameras and more. If you'd like to submit an image it must be 25X25 pixels in 72dpi and msg it to the mods, we will add it to the queue for review and then determine when and if it will be added.

In order to choose your Icon just reply to this thread with your choice, please denote Standard flag or Nitrox colored flag. For Example:

    I would like a Nitrox Rescue Diver flag.


That request would result in the rescue diver flag with the Nitrox colors. We will try to answer your request as quickly as possible, if it does not show up on your posts within 3 days please msg us (as opposed to reposting in this thread)

**EDIT:** Dive Shop has been added, If you work at a dive store and prefer to have that icon you can request it
**EDIT2:** Commercial Diver badge has been added, you are free to request a change to the full helmet/face mask badge.

**--------------------------------**

Descending towards the sea floor is a spiritual experience. Emerald rays of sun glitter like tapestry on my skin. I sink deeper, and the glow fades into the infinite darkness, enveloping me in navy blue. The silence is vast, profound, broken only by the soft sounds of breathing. Life stirs in the shadows, the motion attracting my eye in the gloom. My every movement is slow, controlled, much like those of an astronaut. 

As I land on the bottom, I sink to my knees, sending up great plumes of sand that swirl lazily in the deep. To my left lies a field of sand and sea grass, speckled by colorful coral islands that rise like mountains from the plain. To my right there is a sudden drop; as I move to look over the edge of this great underwater cliff, an endless chasm yawns back at me. Observing the unknown is one of the great pleasures that scuba diving can bring.

Last summer I was diving with my friend Cole in the British Virgin Islands, at a site called “Painted Walls”. We were swimming with some other dive pairs when we spotted a small cave entrance everyone else had been passing by. I glanced over at Cole, and we both immediately knew we had to explore. We paused at the cave entrance, realizing we faced such threats as fire coral, jellyfish, sharks, lobsters, octopuses, lionfish, and myriad other marine life. We both understood that exploring the unknown would be worth it, so I shrugged. “He who hesitates is lost”, right? We entered the fissure, not sure what to expect, and found ourselves in a gradually ascending natural tunnel between two boulders. We turned a corner, and were virtually blinded by the spectacle before us. Sunlight streaming through the exit danced off the walls and ceiling of the tunnel, turning what was murky grey algae at depth into a stunning portrait of intense crimson, vivid yellow, and sunburst orange. What could have been just a glance towards a featureless cave opening turned into one of my most memorable diving experiences. 

Diving partners put their lives in each other’s hands on every dive, and as such they must trust one another implicitly. My dive buddy Cole is one those kids who always enjoys what he is doing, who always threatens to make things interesting. Imagine a stereotypical “surfer bro” from California, with shaggy blonde hair, board shorts, and a tank top; that is Cole. As a diver, he resembles a performance sports car: fast and exhilarating, but subject to loss of control. 

Later in the summer we dove at a site named “Playgrounds”, where towering boulders haphazardly stacked on top of each other promised hundreds of small passageways to explore. This was Cole’s Promised Land— he quickly started zipping around the site, wiggling his way through tunnels and under overhangs, rapidly expending his energy. A diver who goes deeper than 60 feet always runs the risk of contracting nitrogen narcosis, the probability of which is increased if, like Cole, one is exerting oneself. Being “narc’d” produces a state similar to alcohol intoxication, where impaired reasoning and decreased motor control can become dangerous. At one point I was a little way behind him capturing the spectacle on camera, when I saw him stop short and frantically wave his arms to stop his forward momentum. As I hurried over to see what had happened, I watched Cole crazily rip his knife from its sheath, and square off against some unknown foe. He had been swimming so fast that he barely missed colliding with an eight-foot nurse shark, which, now startled, had turned to stare at Cole. I arrived at the scene and desperately tried to stop him from stabbing the shark. I grabbed his wrists and held them behind his back, wresting control of the knife and managing not to cut either of us in the process. I got the feeling that the shark was laughing at us, and we both watched as it fled into the darkness.

One of the things that initially drew me to scuba diving was the aura of danger. The ability to assess and choose what risks I want to take has definitely allowed me to make better choices, and have more fun, on my dives. I know that all of my experience underwater will help me in my life, my job, and my career above water. In business as well as engineering, it is important to take risks to advance one’s position. But it is just as important to know how much risk to take. Edison never would have invented the incandescent light bulb if he did not risk failure 2,000 times, just as Ford never would have engineered the first automobile if he did not risk his economic security. Diving helps me contemplate the far-reaching consequences of my actions, and this training will carry over into my adult life. I know one thing for sure—I’ll never stop diving."	t5_2qhii	True

It would be divided into three parts: a website, where you could register for an account and read reviews about dive spots or leave ratings yourself, as well as review your dive logs. An android app, where you could review your dive logs and plan dives, and a desktop app that could pull data from your dive computer and log it to your account. Would that be something people would be interested in? If so, how much would you be willing to pay for it? I've found multiple apps/websites that do one part or another of this, but nothing that puts it all together in one easy to use interface.	t5_2qhii	True

1331754129.0	qwm63	Quit Job to Scuba - From OW to Instructor - Advice welcome	ClassyDemon	22	0	40	"I left my career (temporarily or permanently - remains to be seen) in order to chase the feeling I can only get when Scuba diving - I want that quality in my life because life is too short. My loose plan, which will change as I learn more and start the process, is take two or three trips to someplace warm, to get AOW and any specialty courses completed. Then I will complete my DM and Instructor certifications on two separate trips, each as long as it takes to get certified and gain experience. At the end of my certification I'll either a) move to a warm location (I live in Boston now) or b) decide it was an awesome experience and go back to work in technology. Since I'm in a relationship I can't live in the Caribbean since my boyfriend works in technology and wants to stay in the states. Therefore I need at least one trip to be in the US so I can get a feel for culture/vibe (Florida or San Diego?). I could use advice on:

1. Best way and locations to trade working for free diving and free/discounted certifications.
2. Florida versus San Diego (or some other places in the US you like)
3. Best places to dive and train in Caribbean
4. Any specific recommendations and contacts in Florida or Caribbean
5. Any guidance on DM or Instructor training

Any other advice and commentary is welcome. Please note: I realize this is not going to make me money already so no need to warn me. I'm not in it for the money. I'm in it to be happier and I believe I am well prepared. Many thanks! 

EDIT: Added some additional questions and that that  I plan on taking as long as it takes to get the certifications and gain enough experience to ensure safety. I'm not on a specific time line, I'm just not entirely sure how long it will take so I guestimated 9 months which was clearly not even close. This is not only about the goal for me, it's also about the journey and self discovery. Thanks everyone for the well wishes and great advice and input! Keep it coming please.

EDIT (May 20, 2012): I got sidetracked from reddit for awhile, but came back today to read all the very insightful advice, comments, well wishes and so on. I appreciate the thought folks have put into advising me; truly I do. I am on my way to Utila, Honduras, to enter a divemaster program. There were several reputable shops with which I've been in touch, so I'm waiting to meet in person to choose (which is outside my comfort zone for sure, but best, I think). I'm also planning to complete the AOW to divemaster program in about 10 weeks, which is longer than most take (6-8 seems to be the average). Then I will reevaluate from there. Very excited to see and experience what's to come. Thanks everyone!

EDIT (Nov 2012): Thanks again everyone. I am a divemaster. I'm happy to report that the original reasons I chose to pursue this were satisfied with my venture, but I definitely saw some things that gave me pause. First, I will say that it's not often you run across those fulfilling moments where you make a difference in someone's life. It happens, but most of the time people just want to dive and they are required by the dive shop to have a divemaster. Thankfully I also naturally found myself taking care of them and not minding it. The biggest challenge I had was taking on people who didn't stick to the plan. So for anyone else thinking about this, watch out for people who either know how to dive or think they do because you may have to chase after them and/or figure out how to negotiate under water about, for example, being more conservative about depth. This usually has more to do with a dive shop than you, so observe whether or not your dive shop interviews its customers about expectations. My experience is that they do not, but my experience is limited. Why didn't I get my instructor level? Well, I didn't love Utila. I did think it was excellent for my purposes which was to get my divemaster and hedge my bets by getting unlimited dives and checking out the scene. But I just wasn't super impressed, not because I doubt the ability of instructors but because of PADI. I suspected this all along but I just was unimpressed with the DM program. It's a series of checkmarks. There's little passing on of wisdom that goes on. It's pretty much, dive a ton, check the box (navigation, swimming tests, lead dives, etc.) and get your DM. I'm sorry but I'm almost 40 years old and I have always mentored people in every job I've held, whether it was Wendy's in my high school/college years or as a technical professional later on. There is sadly so little mentoring in PADI from what I can see. Probably the reason why is because there is no incentive and these guys make so little. Oh - that was another thing that turned me off: The amount of BS that goes on in a diveshop is ridiculous. 

Here's the very interesting thing for those who are looking for this as a lifestyle - it's easy to live like this. You can live on very little, barter, even create your own side business. What I found about these very small places is that it's like living where entrepreneurship is easier than in mainstream society.  However, if you don't want to do that, just don't. You can make it work and live without any extravagances. I was fine without warm showers. But if you need them as well as air conditioning, you may be out of luck. :) 

Basically I realized that if I do this professionally, I will need to own my own place because of my standards about how to run a business- this is not out of the question - but I will have to wait a few more years of employment in my original profession to make this happen. The surprise? Well, I expected that I may not want to pursue this as a career because of the fact that so many people said the joy would be taken away once I was a professional. To the contrary, my most memorable moments were when I was working with people who were...terrible. Why? Because I was a part of an amazing experience for them. "	t5_2qhii	True

He liked my pictures and stories and videos, but he was also only 3. He could swim, and was a good swimmer, so it doesn't make sense.

[trip report]	Anjin	23	2	20	"The island is small (40 square miles: http://g.co/maps/6xegn) and pretty undeveloped. I was told that only 5% of people have electricity, only like 6,000 people live there, and they have about an average of 20 visitors at any time - most not tourists. There are 3 hotels and 3 restaurants, one at each hotel - you probably get the idea that there's not a whole lot going on.  
  
So what is there to do there? Dive. The entire island is surrounded by a fringing reef that because of the low number of visitors, and the low amount of development pollution, is incredibly healthy. There aren't really dives sites, you just kind of jump into the water and swim left or right, shallower or deeper, and everywhere around you, everything is covered in hard corals. I went down to like 110 and I could see going down into the depths row after row of giant plate corals. Taking macro pictures was difficult in the extreme because there was almost no dead stuff or rocks to grab ahold of, and I always had the fear that if I didn't pay attention I'd ram my head into the sharp edge of a fan of hard coral.  
  
I hadn't heard of the place before I won airfare at the LA SCUBA show this past summer, so I figured that a trip report would be a good idea to spread the word. I'm guessing it won't stay like it is forever.

After diving for just over 30 minutes (30-40ft depth average) she had already used 2500psi and needed to go. I was upset to a certain degree because I still had 2000psi left and it was frustrating having to surface so quickly. Are there any specific tricks she could use for better air conservation?

**Edit** Thank you everyone for all the input! My sister does have a minor case of anxiety disorder which I'm sure is contributing to her air consumption. We live about 100 miles apart so it's difficult for me to help her with exercise and yoga but I will certainly encourage her and help her with her stress. Thank you for all the tips, I'll be sure to share them with her. If my budget allows, we'll be out in the water again in the next couple weeks!"	t5_2qhii	True

1307017256.0	hpvao	Just earned our open water... getting ready for our first trip!	AdShooter	20	0	12	"I've been following /r/scuba for a about a month now and I have to say, every post has been great! Two weeks ago my wife and I earned our open water certification. Next stop is a trip to Cayman Brac courtesy with the help of [The Dive Pirates](http://www.divepirates.org/). This wonderful organization helps disabled and handicap (mostly veterans, but some civilians as you will learn) divers acquire their open water certification and to experience their first dive trip. My family has been involved with them for many years, serving on their board and holding officer positions, and in my case being their event photographer. 

After I got married, my wife, who is limb deficient, also became involved and this year we were chosen for the trip(well, she was... and she chose me as her dive buddy). I want to congratulate my wife most of all for working hard to get a regular open water certification rather than an adaptive diver open water certification. I know some of the drills were more difficult for her than they were for me, but her perseverance was very inspiring. 

I'll be posting updates about the trip here if anyone will be interested in knowing how it is going. The trip is going to be quite the experience as we'll be diving with a variety of divers, from limb deficient to full quadriplegics. We leave on June 18.

Also, if any of you would like more information on the Dive Pirates, for volunteer opportunities and what not, let me know and I'll get you in touch with the organizers.

I had a few problems, terrified girlfriend, a guy (me) that gets sick every time he gets on a boat. This community has been nothing but supportive. My now wife and I have recently just finished our open water certs on our honeymoon. Not only has this subreddit provided some awesome advice to help me combat my sea sickness and allow my wife to over come our fears, you recommend an awesome dive company while we were on vacation in Vietnam. Here are just a few pics and 1 vid of our trip. Thanks again, and we look forward to more diving adventures!
