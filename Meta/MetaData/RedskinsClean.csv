1355426185.0	14ss1h	IAm Lorenzo Alexander, linebacker for the Washington Redskins, AMA	Redskinsdotcom	510	86	238	"I attended St. Mary’s High School in Berkeley, Calif., before going on to play football for the University of California, where I received the Brick Muller Award as the team’s most valuable defensive lineman. Coming out of college, I signed with the Panthers (2005), but have found my home with the Redskins and am now in my seventh year with the team. Serving as team captain, I have played in 76 career games and compiled 5.5 sacks, 56 special teams tackles, and am fortunate enough to be a two-time winner of the Redskins Walter Payton Man of the Year Award (2010, 2011). 

I founded the ACES Foundation, which supports youth through emphasizing self-accountability and teaching them to take pride in their community and striving for educational excellence while promoting a healthy mind and body through sports. I also work closely with the Washington Redskins Charitable Foundation and joined the POTUS and First Lady at the 2010 White House Easter Egg Roll to help kids learn the value of good health. I've only got about 20 minutes because I have to get back to work to prepare for the Browns, but ask me anything about the team, my upbringing, or my work in the community.

Feel free to head over to **[THEIR THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1hi8cz/rcowboys_and_rredskins_official_flair_wager/)** to talk some smack.

***PLEASE UPVOTE TO KEEP ON TOP (I DON'T EARN KARMA FOR THIS)***

The wager is as follows:

1. A nice comment about the other team at the end of every comment in italics. (Try to keep it ""clean"" as mods requested - **This applies for /r/NFL and other NFL subs**) 
1. Changing all flair (ONLY FOR SUBS, NOT /r/NFL DUE TO COMPLAINING) to the other team's logo.
1. Switch subreddit headers

These will all last for one week, from the day after defeat (Monday) until the following Monday. Meaning that the next game day thread will be covered in the other team's shit.

We played much better in the 2nd, especially on Offense, but you guys probably edged us on the balance. I was very impressed with Griffin's maturity, especially on that last drive. We blitzed several players up the gut on the 2nd play of that drive and he calmly found Fred Davis for a huge one.

But guys. GUYS.

We were up against the reigning super-bowl champions. A team that made the 49ers look like a JV high school practice squad just one week ago. The Giants are, as hard as it is to admit, a better team.

We're playing with a rookie QB and a rookie RB starting. We suffered several huge injuries both before this game and during this game. We had no right stepping into the Giants stadium and putting up a fight.

But we did. The Redskins gave the NYG one hell of a battle. We converted on numerous 4th downs. RG3 showed incredible athleticism and heart, taking us down-field in the clutch. The fact that we lost a game this close to the Giants is a god-damn miracle, and certainly should give all skins fans hope that our squad can run with the best. 

Hold your heads high, friends. We are the best Redskins team in over a decade, regardless of our record.  RG3 is a rookie and he's playing like an MVP. Our future is bright. Keep your spirits up, keep your hopes up, and keep on routing as hard as you can for the Washington Redskins. 

Hail.

I completely understand that this is a huge hot-button topic and I completely understand why there are strong, even heated arguments to be heard from both sides. What I don't understand though is why things have to devolve into bickering and name calling everyime a large thread about the subject pops up. 

We obviously can't just forbid people from talking about it but we can however ask that nobody submit new threads on the subject. It's been beaten to death and theres not a lot of common ground to be found at this point. /r/NFL [seems to agree as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1dhkmp/please_read_the_redskins_name_controversy/). 

If something official comes out from either The Redskins orginization or the NFL then sure, lets discuss official changes. But in the meantime leave it alone and if it comes up in a thread because someone mentioned it then just keep it civil. There seems to be atleast three or four ""what do you think the new name should be!?"" threads popping up every week, a lot of them we already delete because there are so many. 

If you want to talk about a possible name change and whether or not it's needed then keep it in one of the older threads already made and please keep it civil. I really dont want to have to delete every comment in every thread and censor people because a few can't behave and debate like adults.

Those sentiments are understandable, and should be expected after the horror show we saw on Sunday.  The Rams game was pretty much worst case scenario all around, and it sucks. It still sucks

But I don't want to add to the negativity.  I just wanted to take the time to just wish Mr. Orakpo, my favorite NFL player, a healthy and speedy recovery.  It's always tough injuring the same part of your body that you had hurt previously, but with this guy's work ethic and drive, I assume he'll be back and even better next year.  2013 is his contract year, in fact.

If you can find a TV replay of the play, RG3 is hugging Crawford and giving him words of encouragement and you can clearly see him tearing up.

Pretty badass player in my opinion. His heart is in the game.

Do NOT send any more messages, as they will not he considered for the VIP pass drawing. Winners will be notified by today at 4 PM, and the thread will be updated again when they have been notified.
_______________________
**Final Edit:** That's that!  Those who've won the passes have been notified.  If you've received no word either way, reply again to /u/RedskinsCampMeetup for an update.

IMPORTANT: If you've received a pass, and for whatever reason you can't make it down to camp, PLEASE NOTIFY /u/RedskinsCampMeetup!  There are others who could certainly like to take advantage of this offer, and we could re-purpose your pass for them.

IF YOU DID NOT WIN A PASS:  As I mention above, you could still be in the running, so keep checking on /r/redskins for updates.  And I can't stress enough that this meetup is bigger than the passes themselves!  Please come on down and support the team!  It'd make me proud to see an army of Redditors from D.C., Maryland, and Virginia assemble in Richmond to watch our boys tune up to defend their NFC East Championship title.  I'll be mingling with both groups, and I'd love to meet the people I've been chatting with for almost 2 years. :)

___________________

Also, more excitingly, after some PM and email tag, Fred Smoot has announced he will be joining us for the meetup! Your own FredSmoot21, a former Redskins great will be in attendance for camp on Wednesday, and he might bring a +1 who you'd also be interested in meeting. Please, whether you've been awarded a pass or not, come on down and make your presence felt. This is going to be a blast!

Hello, Redskins faithful!  Myself and fellow /r/NFL mod and Skins fan /u/ugnaught will be hosting a Reddit NFL meetup down in Richmond on Wednesday, August 14th. Practice starts promptly at 12:40 PM.

I know what you're thinking.  ""Ramses, you boob, I work during the week.  Why not make this a weekend trip?""  Well, subscribers, several months ago, Reddit founder (and our burgundy and gold brother) /u/kn0thing approached the Redskins social media team, inviting them to host AMAs in /r/redskins, /r/nfl, and /r/ama.  The same social media team he talked to has reached out to /r/redskins again, and has offered us **50 VIP access passes** for the afternoon of the 14th.  Yeah, THAT'S why.  The passes will get you much closer to the team, get you spots on the autograph line, get you access to complementary refreshments, and generally make you feel cooler than everyone else because you're wearing a lanyard that says EXPLICITLY that you are important.  I know, right?

So here's the deal.  The meetup is for EVERYONE who has/can get that Wednesday off.  Come on down and show your support for the team, get some pics, hit the food trucks, surround yourself with fellow fans, and get psyched for the new season.  It might be tricky, but I'd love to get us all in one spot at least for a bit to get a huge group pic.  If you're going to play hookie from work, do not pose for the group pic.

If you want to throw your name in the hat for the VIP access passes, please send a PM to /u/RedskinsCampMeetup with your name and an email address where you can be reached.  This is so the team can confirm your identity and reserve a pass for you personally at the social media tent.  You will need a photo ID to receive your pass.  If we get 50 or fewer applicants, every man jack will get a VIP pass. :)  If we get more than 50, we will select at random who will receive the passes.

* Camp facility info: http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/training-camp/index.html

* Parking and visitors tips from WaPo: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/07/24/redskins-training-camp-in-richmond-if-youre-going/

* Some common sense stuff: Check the weather (disposable ponchos cost nothing and you won't regret having one), dress appropriately (it can get muddy, DON'T wear nice shoes), bring water and snacks if you don't plan to budget for concessions, and lawn chairs if you want a place to sit. Practice is at 12:40, but get there EARLY if you want to find a good spot.  D.C. to Richmond is 1.5 to 2.5 hours depending on our state's oh-so-predictable traffic.

Please feel free to use this thread to ask questions, coordinate carpools, and make recommendations. If you've been to camp already this year, PLEASE share your experiences and make suggestions on meeting spots, parking, or any information you think is useful.  That's about it.  We'll see you guys a week from tomorrow. **HAIL!**


**EDIT:**

Answering a couple of commonly asked questions.  We will be making the selections on Friday afternoon, so you'll know then whether you've won the passes or not.  We've already gotten WELL OVER 50 requests, so this will come to a drawing. **PLEASE HAVE ANY SUBMISSIONS SENT TO US BY FRIDAY AT NOON. THAT IS THE CUTTOFF.**

We've also gotten a lot of requests from people who'd like more than one pass, but unfortunately we can only provide one pass per request.  If your account was created **after** this original post was created, it will be eliminated from the drawing.  Sorry, but we can't have people loading the proverbial ballot box."	t5_2r4wc	True

1349807342.0	117hqg	A letter, to my dearest Kai Forbath....	Drunken_Black_Belt	67	7	11	"Dear Kai,

It isn't easy to write this.  Hearing your name as our new kicker, I was left with mixed feelings. Pain, confusion, but maybe somewhere deep down, hope....

I won't pretend to know you. But, dare I say it? Im a little excited to get to know you.  So much promise for us.  But I'm worried.  I've given my heart before, and been hurt.  No, Shh. Don't speak. Let me finish.  I know we both have pasts. I've run around with kickers in the past. Sure it often started great, seeming like this was it. I had finally found someone who could do what needed be done to get that ball between the uprights, the uprights of my heart.  But it always quickly soured.  And it hurts.  This time it was easier. A month ago the name Cundiff was on my heart, and it made me smile. But I quickly learned that my latest infatuation wasn't kicking the ball, only kicking me in my balls. Metaphorically of course.

And I realize you have a past as well Kai Forbath.  Had always heard good things about you, but other teams found you wanting. So you'll excuse me if I am scared.  I don't want to hurt anymore.  I'm willing to give you time, if you are willing to give me PAT's.  And while 30 and 40 yarders are expected, maybe, occasionally you could throw in a 50+ yarder?  To help me learn to love again, to feel complete again.

Please Kai, be gentle.  I don't want to keep feeling like this.

Love,
A Redskin Fan.

DustBreakOverlord	70	7	52	"Here is the link to the article which has given me a bit of confidence regarding RG's knee: 

http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/wp/2013/01/10/james-andrews-rgiii-already-wants-to-start-rehab/

I've been obsessed with RG's knee. With figuring out why, how, wtf...etc. We all have, because we care about the team and that dude's future.

I need to live my life now. There is more playoff football to watch and there is much more shit we could all do with our lives besides obsess over this dudes knee.

What's done is done. All I can do is put my faith in RG's work ethic, put my faith in the specialists ability to provide a path to full rehab, put my faith in RG's ability to use his brain to avoid situations like the ATL hit and the B'more hit, and hope for the best.

I'm a sceptic who can easily err on the side of pessimism. But, after reading everything I could find about RG's injury...I have very very high hopes that his recovery will be handled amazingly and with fantastic results.

Even more so, I have faith in the path that the Redskins are on now, regardless of who our QB is for the 2013 season start.

Let's watch the precious last moments of the current NFL season, enjoy our lives and look forward to watching the Skins improve year over year.

**Q: General Question: What was your ""Welcome to the NFL"" moment?**

A: It took me to the facility after I got drafted, they were walking me around and took me to the training room and the cold tub room, and they showed me these grey tins. I thought they were joking, the cold tanks they had in the league were the ones that we had in high school. It was my welcome to the NFL moment - you might not all have the best equipment but you have to make it work. - RGIII

--
**Q: Addressed to anyone... Do you think college players should receive some kind of financial compensation for their work, or is the lure of a multi-million dollar contract when they leave school enough?**

A: That's a whole issue on it's own. Not every sport makes money for their school, football definitely does but you can't pay one athlete and not another. But there's always going to be a problem - if they get paid, it's not enough. And if they don't, they should be paid. -RGIII

--
**Q: General question: 1) What's your favorite video game? 2) If you weren't a football player, what would you be doing?**

A: My favorite video game is Assassins Creed and NCAA and Madden. Truthfull if I wasn't a football player, I'd be in law school. Fictionally, I'd be a professional ping pong player. -RGIII

--
**Q: General question: Who is the one current player (collegiate or professional) that you would not want to line up against?**

A: If it was just me and another guy on the field by ourselves, probably Mario Williams. - RGIII

--
**Q: To anybody- Who was the player you looked up to as a role model as a child?**

A: Michael Jordan. - RGIII

--
**Q: What's the most frustrating thing about playing football professionally; interpret that however you would like.**

A: You're provided with a stage to help people and inspire people, but at the same time you're criticized for whatever you say. -RGIII

--
**Q: General Question-When looking at your journey to the heisman and the nfl, how much do you think natural talent played in? Or did you really have to work for it?**

A: I think every athlete has to work for it. Everyone's going to be blessed with some natural talent, be it speed, mental, height, weight - but it's how you harness and use that talent is what counts. -RGIII

--
**Q: General Question: What was it like to shake the hands of all the previous winners when you won the Heisman trophy? Any memorable remaks from the former winners?**

A: They all told me welcome to the family. It's a moment that not everyone gets to participate it. I really take it to the heart and will never forget it. -RGIII

--
**Q: To all: Favorite NFL stadium to play in? Least favorite?**

A: Favorite: Fedex Field, Least: Don't have one. -RGIII

--
**Q: To anyone: what was it like walking onto the field for the first time as a starter?**

A: A dream come true. Turn your dreams into reality and you go out there to play with the best of the best. It's what you live for. -RGIII

--
**Q: Who was your funniest teammate?**

A: Chris C. last year. -RGIII

--
**Q: To all- What is your favorite memory from your high school football days?**

A: Growing up with the guys that you played with, you're with these guys for almost 12 years of your life. That's the memorable part for me. -RGIII

--
**Q: RG3, which would you value more: your Heisman trophy or the Lombardi trophy?**

A: Super Bowl, it's the pinnacle. Although some look at the Heisman as the pinnacle of college awards. -RGIII

--
**Q: RG3, what extra work do you do either during the season or offseason that you believe helps you the most? By the way, best of luck this season! Keep having a speedy recovery!**

A: Just not forgetting what I did to get me where I am. Just cause you're at the next level doesn't mean you don't stop doing the things you did at the lower levels. -RGIII

--
**Q: RG3, what socks are you wearing?**

A: I''m wearing some bright neon socks with a nice design on the back. -RGIII

--
**Q: What other sport would you want to play if it wasn't football?**

A: Basketball, I thought about it. It was my first love. I started on varsity as a freshman and I had numerous offers to play college basketball. -RGIII

I was small for my age and was always picked last for football games at recess...so I sort of had an internal bias towards the game. I wanted to be good at it but I couldn't, so I refused to watch it.  

Now my family (mainly my father) is a Skins family through and through, so when we drafted Sean my mom would always tell me ""Taylor, you should get that jersey, it has your name on it!"" I would always roll my eyes and say something to the tune of ""That's his last name Mom...blah blah blah...angst."" One day I decided to watch a Redskins game in full, first time I had done this, and I made sure to pay attention to the guy with my not technically correct name on his jersey.  

Long story short, I saw a force of nature on the field. Someone who was so exciting to watch, just like Robert is today, that I had to stay glued to the TV. No matter what the score I'd stay in front of that set, his raw talent could change the game (see that crazy Dallas game with the kick block, you know the one). I finally saw what people got from football, watching men perform feats that we could only dream of and, by playing with friends, trying to emulate such feats.  

I haven't missed a game since that day and I'd like to thank Mr. Taylor for that gift. Rest in peace.

Feel free to head over to **[THEIR THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/eagles/comments/1hjg1w/official_signup_to_participate_in_the_reagles_vs/)** to talk some smack.

***PLEASE UPVOTE TO KEEP ON TOP (I DON'T EARN KARMA FOR THIS)***

The wager is as follows:

1. A nice comment about the other team at the end of every comment in italics. (Try to keep it ""clean"" as mods requested - **This applies for /r/NFL and other NFL subs**) 
1. Changing all flair (ONLY FOR SUBS, NOT /r/NFL DUE TO COMPLAINING) to the other team's logo.
1. ~~Switch subreddit headers~~ - Eagles sub mods are being weak about this

These will all last for one week, from the day after defeat (Monday) until the following Monday. Meaning that the next game day thread will be covered in the other team's shit.

We will have the main lounge area on the ground floor - 13 booths, multiple tables, four big armchairs, 8 - 12 televisions, sound for all of the games, and great food and drink specials for us exclusively! 

We will also be celebrating on Saturday the 26th for the Redskins/Broncos game on the 27th, and getting a big tailgating group together.  

I will keep updating as plans solidify.  We have a Facebook group ""RedskinsfansofDenver"" that will stay updated.  It would be awesome to get a reddit meetup going!

D-hall - I'd love to replace him, but there's nobody to replace him with right now.

Haslett - this guy was making strides with our defense before we got obliterated by 1) injuries and 2) the not often brought up salary cap penalties.  We should have at least one, maybe two very solid players in that secondary that we just don't because of the cap issue.  And even then, we've had some decent games.  Giants was a good game, not his fault at the end.  Falcons we played good enough to win.  I think punishing him under the circumstances he's been put in is premature.

Danny Smith - I see the most reason here.  I don't like Banks, I don't like blocked punts.  But that said - Banks had a decent game and Kai Forbath is playing very damn well.  So what are you gonna do, fire him in the middle of the season to send a message?  That never works.

Now our D can't stay off the field for more than 3 minutes before they have to trot back out.  It feels no different than any year in the past decade.  **But it is.**

I am STUNNED by the ""fire Shanny,"" and ""Kyle knows nothing about calling plays,"" and ""axe them both and start over!"" talk I've heard in the past couple of weeks.  Our team finally, *finally* has management that abstains from what we've been bitching about for 13 years.  They didn't trade youth for expensive has-beens that'll move jerseys.  They converted currency into quality draft picks.  They've replaced prima donnas with captains and team players.  They've begun to address both lines.  THE LINES!

Fire them!?  We've been floundering for this long precisely because we've had a revolving door of coaches who don't stay long enough to get the team walking in one direction.  No cohesive vision, no respect for a credible authority figure, and poor Jason Campbell (stay scrappy, kid) learning a new offense every six minutes.  **Fun fact:** Since Snyder bought the team in '99, exactly ONE head coach has had longer than 2 years before getting yanked.  One.  His name was Joe Gibbs, and despite the fact that (Hogs forgive me) his mind for the game was not exactly compatible with the new NFL, HE STILL TOOK US TO THE PLAYOFFS TWICE IN 4 YEARS.  That is what a stable environment can do, even for a team built by Danny and Vinny!

We got shut out last week, and I felt that pain with you.  Despite the absence of offensive momentum, I might be the only Skins fan who actually *likes* our QB situation.  Not because I like our QBs (eww), but because there was no good move to be made in free agency or the draft.  We couldn't hit on Newton, and everyone else was a question mark.  People rave about Dalton, but forget that he didn't come packaged with A.J. Green.  Gabbert, Ponder, Locker, Mallet, Kapernick... all huge question marks.  This team is too thin at too many positions to blow an early pick on a QB that's 50/50, **especially** with knowledge of the next year's depth of talent at QB.

Hasslebeck's getting very old, and while he's preforming well, the end of his tenure with Seattle gave us no reason to believe he would.  Oakland drastically overpaid for Palmer considering he's going to play about 8 games for them.  A #1 pick (and maybe more) for half a season of *possibly* good production is a Cerrato move, and I'm thrilled we didn't make it.

I know the offensive unit looks like a bunch of monkey poo at the moment, but this is a **process.**  13 years of mismanagement weren’t going to be undone in 2.  Complaining about the current state of the team is like taking your car to the mechanic because it keeps stalling, seeing the partially dismantled engine during the repair, and saying, “OMG WTF IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN!!!1!”  We finally have some grownups running the show, and if they’re as efficient and productive with FA and draft acquisitions next year as they were this year, we might not be dominant, but expect to see some fireworks.  For now, stay strong.  Don’t be Dannys.  I’m out.

1365170199.0	1bqdps	I'm more excited for next season than I am for Breaking Bad. Here are a couple reasons for why you should be also.	jkangg	47	1	34	"1. Our star QB is coming off of a terrible injury and sudden departure from the playoffs and will be exponentially motivated to show the world that he can play at a high level without getting injured.

2. We have the Sex Cannon back, along with Cousins. Those two can tear it up in the pocket if need be, and we now have a backup in the read option with Pat White. Name me one team that has more depth at QB this offseason, just one.

3. Garcon's foot injury should be fully healed. He's the Redskins best receiver, without a doubt. He's electrifying, physical, speedy and makes sick catches like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxPvFAY6hj4). We also get to see Fred Davis tear it up after missing the second half of the season. I know he's not a media darling or mature to a certain standard, but he brings a level of physicality that the Redskins severely need in the receiving corps. This guy is a straight up bull. Also, he did say he's going to make every other single team that didn't sign him pay, so it goes without saying that he's going to be motivated. 

4. Adam Carriker and Brian Orakpo are back! Rob Jackson, Barry Cofield and Ryan Kerrigan really had time to develop last year and were two of the reasons why we were able to slide by with our leaking secondary. With Adam Carriker eating up space, Brian Orakpo bull rushing and eating people, Rob Jackson tricking the shit out of QB's, intercepting them then licking their tears, Ryan Kerrigan snatching his own tipped balls then running them back for TD's, and Perry Riley bringing physicality and making tackles out of nowhere we have one of the most versatile and balanced, no, I think we have the BEST 3-4 in the league. Chris Neild too!

5. One of the major reasons why our secondary allowed so many big plays last year is because we had no hard-hitting safeties to punish deep routes. [Brandon Meriweather](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfPEjI1cKkc) really has a knack for finding the ball, but more importantly he's a punisher. Welcome back Brandon! Please stay out of trouble and don't get injured!

6. We don't have many draft picks. You might ask why I say this excites me, but look at it this way. We had one of the most rewarding drafts last year. RGIII, Alfmo, Kirk Cousins. Went from rebuilding mode, 4-12 to NFC East Champions and we kept all our rookies. Tell me one team that drafted better than us, just one. With less rookies coming in to the team, the coaches and the players get to focus more on refinement and building team chemistry and less on teaching/mentoring rookies(not to mention more cap space). Guys, for the first time in more than five years, we aren't in rebuilding mode anymore. We don't need to rely on the draft for hope anymore, wake up! We are the defending NFC East Champions and RGIII will lead us to the promise-land!

7. This is the best Redskins team I have seen since 1991. 

Edit:

We get to play elite playoff contenders like the Packers, Broncos, Falcons and 49ers this year. Our schedule is definitely tougher after taking home the NFC East crown, but these games are going to show us what the Redskins are made of.

P.S. Can we get a countdown in our sidebar for when we get to see our Skins play again? I CAN'T FUCKING 
WAIT!

Comments ranged from [Sherman talking about how he is not scared of any of the Skins WRs](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000121629/article/richard-sherman-not-worried-about-washington-redskins)
to [Brandon Browner talking about how he is going to smack Santana Moss around](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dDtbFRnWb4A)...

When asked about the comments Garcon responded with:

*""Facing the Seahawks' physical corners ""will be good matchup, a good battle,'' Garcon said. ""They're going to play their game. We're going to play our game. We're going to see what we have to do to make plays and score points.''*

Hankerson responded:

*""We're not worried about what they've got going on over there. We have a quality group of guys who can all go out and make plays. We can't make this bigger than it is. They have a great defense. If we have all 11 guys playing on the same page, it'll be hard to stop us.''*

The Redskins have been surprisingly quiet &amp; not gotten dragged into it. All week. Just how we like it. There is no reason to get sucked into a shit talking battle. Let the play on the field talk.

We need to follow the same lead. I know they are antagonizing us, harassing us in our own sub-reddit, but let's just let the play on the field talk. After the game I am sure they will quiet down with their tail between their legs.

Our boy from Muncie, Indiana has become quite the player in just his second year in the league.  When we took him with the 16th pick, we all knew how much hope the Redskins defensive minds were putting on him, given the fact that we needed a complement to Rak, as well as a way to boost our pass rush.  His 2011 season stats were good (7.5 sacks, 4 forced fumbles, and a legendary pick-six against Eli Manning), but not considered great when compared to guys like Aldon Smith, Von Miller, and J.J. Watt--all pass-rushing beasts who came out of the same draft as Kerrigan did.

Going into 2012, the hopes were on Rak and Kerrigan to spearhead our third year in Haslett's system.  But with the injury to #98 early in the season, it fell to Kerrigan to be our bulk of our OLB/DE presence in the backfield.  Ryan's had some good stretches in 2012 (including his pick-six against Atlanta and his legendary sack of Romo on the Thanksgiving game).  Sometimes he had quiet stretches too.  But over the last six games, he has come on strong with 4 sacks, 3 passes defended, and 2 forced fumbles.  If you watched the game against the Iggles today, he was just ridiculous with the pressure he got on Foles.

He's really coming into his own now, and his play will only get better.  I love this man, he's going to be one of the cornerstones of our D for years to come.

**EDIT: Some very bitter and pathetic individuals are down-voting comments so show them how it's really done by UP-VOTING comments like crazy! Just because you don't have parade doesn't mean you have to rain on ours. And please fellow Skins-fans, do not even entertain the idea of going to any other sub to down-vote or stir things up in response to this. Let the assholes be assholes all by themselves.** 

We're posting early to get in on all the pre-game chatter! If you're at the game, get loud! If you're watching from home or at a sports bar then hell, get loud there too!

The Redskins are coming off seven straight wins including a huge victory at home which sealed the NFC EAST division title and knocked off The Dallas Cowboys from playoff contention. Now they'll host the red-hot Seattle Seahawks who come roaring into the playoffs as one of the most feared teams in the NFC. 

Arguably the two best rookie QB's will lead their respective teams into battle. This should be an intensely competitive brawl as both of these amazing young talents want it bad and are good enough to get it done, the real story however will be how well these defenses respond and play against similar read-option offenses featuring two of the best RB's in the league.

Our standard operating procedure for memes has basically been to remove them, take them eighy miles out and bury them six feet deep. Then later we build a gazebo over the corpses so nobody will find them. 

Theres a good place for NFL related memes and thats [/r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu). They dig that kind of thing over there. 

We've had a nice little influx of fans recently and the number of memes submitted has skyrocketed. I've lost count of how many ""the most interesting QB in the world"" pictures I've removed since Monday night. 

All that being said, I'm an open minded guy and if the demand for Redskins related memes remains inexplicably high then I would be open to just doing a weekly Meme thread similiar to how /r/NFL has weekly GIF/IMAGES threads to keep everything neat and tidy in one place so it's not flooding the front page.

Seems like every year Skins fan seem overly optimistic, but this year I think that optimism is truly warranted. A solid young core of players, with many of them looking to make a step up this year. RGIII is the real deal. Defense isn't bad either. I think in 4-5 years or so when Brady, Peyton, and Brees begin to retire, Rodgers, RGIII, and probably Cam will be the best 3 quarterbacks in the league. I could even see the Skins winning the NFC East this year. The only thing I'm not 100% on is the #1 WR, I think having a bigbody go-to guy would make guys like Garcon, Moss, and the rest much better, but I think RGIII has enough pieces to make it work.

I've wandered over into ""enemy territory"" to see what the reaction was to our new found loss of cap space.  While I'm not happy about the cap hit the one heartening thing I've found is that the Redskins fans seem to be just as belligerent about this situation as the Cowboys fans are (and rightfully so).  What upsets me the most about this whole situation is the timing of it. If we (Cowboys, Redskins) broke the rules, fine, I can deal with the consequences. Even the fact that other teams may have taken advantage and aren't getting punished, fine, I can deal with that too. But to enact the punishment 24 hours before free-agency begins is absolute crap. This could honestly ruin free agency and even the draft for both teams.  The way I see it is even if legal action is taken and the teams are successful, it will already be too late. The high impact free agents that both teams will need their cap room for will be signed and off the market. The damage will done.  Anything done retroactively will almost be another slap in the face as we can't go back and re-resign free agents.  The NFL knows what its doing and anything after the fact will be like the asshole who cuts in front of you in line and then says, ""OH!? Were you waiting here? Sorry!""


As an outsider looking in I don't know nearly enough about the Redskins to make deeply informed comments but from what I see the team was headed in the right direction.  It was a lot of picks to give up although realistically the team only lost 3.  However, from what I can tell RGIII seems to be the real deal with the perfect combination of smarts, character, and athleticism.  In addition, with the cap room the Redskins had the team seemed poised to throw all sorts of money at big name WR(s) and possibly additional OL help to reboot the offense.  However, now that the cap space has been cut I'm wondering what you think the Redskins will do to adjust to this crapy situation.  Does the team follow through and finalize the trade for the #2 overall or do you rescind your offer and account for the lack of cap space? 


As a couple asides, I would first like to say how much your RGIII ""HOPE"" picture made me laugh.  Also, of all the NFC East teams I think the Redskins are the team that I hate the least.  I always like watching Cowboys-Redskins games because regardless of talent they always seem to be close and most importantly entertaining.  In the end I hope all this cap crap works out and both teams are able to recover from it.  Also, I can't help but wonder that if the Cowboys and Redskins have to deal with this kind of asshole behavior from the league for paying players ON the books, what the hell is the league going to do to the Saints for paying players off the books?

1366833157.0	1d14pt	Shanahan's draft history and who we could pick for our RT spot	AlcoholicZebra	39	3	15	"We know that Shanahan loves his athletic lineman, we know he loves his Zone Blocking, and we know there are certain traits that Shanny looks for in his lineman.

Going back to 2004 (so the past 9 drafts), we see Shanny draft lineman who are well ahead of the curve in the agility drills.  The Shuttle and the 3 Cone make up the Agility Score.  If you're wondering, he's drafted 14 total lineman.  5 have been OT's (below), and 6 of the 9 Guards or Centers have had an agility score of 12.29 or lower.  Josh LeRibeus got that 12.29.

* Ryan Clady - 11.8

* Selvish Capers - 11.95

* Trent Williams - 11.96

* Tom Compton - 12.19

* Ryan Harris - 12.3

NFL Average for an OT's agility score - 12.51 (lower is better)

If we consider Ryan Harris to be the absolute slowest Shanny is willing to draft at OT, than here are the 2013 OT candidates for our team:

* Lane Johnson - 11.83

* David Quessenberry - 11.94

* Eric Fisher - 12.03

* Tanner Hawkinson - 12.03

* Justin Pugh - 12.08

* Luke Joeckel - 12.08

* Braden Brown - 12.13

* Vinston Painter - 12.27

* Reid Fragel - 12.3

Guys just outside of the cutoff at 12.34 are Nick Becton and Terron Armstead (why not, let's include both of them)

So let's seperate these prospects by draft estimates and ignore the 3 guys that are probably going in the Top 10 picks.  We can now ballpark in what round Shanny might draft a RT depending on whose still available.  Some guys are sort of in-between rounds, so I'll include them in both round.

**Round 2:**

Terron Armstead

Justin Pugh

**Round 3:**

Justin Pugh

David Quessenberry

**Round 4:**

David Quessenberry

Vinston Painter

Reid Fragel

**Round 5:**

Vinston Painter

**Round 6:**

Nick Becton

**Round 7:**

Nick Becton

I'm not saying we should be happy he's gone, but he probably wasn't going to get an opportunity like this in Washington and he sure as hell earned one.

The Shanahans have been dialing up our offense to be 4th in the league!! That is beyond amazing.  Kyle that was some brilliant play calling against the Browns, that PA Bootleg play you implemented in the second quarter probably won us the game.  After coming off a horrible first quarter to then make some adjustments to fit Kirk's playing style you did amazing!  Also the pistol read option... need i say more.

**defense**

HOLY CRAP you guys have been coming up HUGE.  Special thanks to Hasslet for changing it around and fitting the players (back to back great second halves).  Also to ROB MOTHERFUCKING JACKSON who has been tearing it up with the BIG(i can not stress BIG enough here) turnovers!  Kerrigan of course with the big batted passes each game.  and Flether for making Weeden pay for the bad pass.

**offense**

You guys are amazing!  Thanks to all the Rookies/ Sophomores  and new additions to the team, you guys have been fantastic.  And i am  not just talking about RG3, Morris, and Kirk.  But Robinson, Crawford, Hankerson, Niles Paul, and Royster (sorry for any i missed any).  Also thanks to our receiving core Moss, Garcon (that was a BULLSHIT TAUNT CALL BTW), and Morgan for always coming up big when we need them.

**special teams**  

You guys just keep coming up big on the kick returns and punt returns,  Keep making them earn the rest of the field.  Also King Kai!

**edit** changed Helu to Royster, was my mistake.

I just want everyone to be aware that as RG3 continues to have great success, there will be more and more haters coming out. Hell, we've already seen some serious backlash against the RG3 ""circklejerk,"" that  people in /r/nfl are getting frustrated about.

I just want us all to remember that we are a highly intelligent, modest fan-base. While it may not seem fair, every post we make on /r/nfl is inadvertently a reflection of the entire fan base.

While things are starting to get a little nasty (specifically with Colt fans arguing Luck v. RG3), it our duty to remain calm and let RG3 speak for himself.

Anyways, apologies for the rant. I just don't want to see our sudden success lead people to think we are like Cowboy fans."	t5_2r4wc	True

He mentions that he spends a lot of time on twitter and tries to read every single tweet. What if we spam him asking him to do an IAMA in our subreddit? I doubt it will happen but he's just crazy enough to do it if it catches his attention..... 

Tweet something like: 

@TheCooleyZone Please visit and chat with us at reddit.com/r/redskins!  

Or whatever you want really, just shamelessly plug our subreddit so he see's it. Just looking at his twitter he takes a lot of time to respond to his fans. And I guess it wouldn't hurt if we got some other Skin's fans to see the link and join our ranks. I think it would be fun to try either way. Or tell me to fuck off with my stupid idea, either or.

1374975693.0	1j6yza	Here are some tips about how to approach Skins training camp, from someone working the camp!	skins_worker	36	4	15	"1. Autographs - RGIII has gone to the endzone closer to the main building each day so far, so get a frontrow standing space there before the chaos starts. Be prepared to get shoved, and definitely don't bring a chair. Chairs have to be folded up about 2 hours before practice at 3:20 begins. If you can get his autograph, try moving back to the 50 yard line and talk to the longsnapper Nick Sunberg. Easily the nicest guy on the team, and that's not a knock on the other players. Just a great guy who loves interacting with the fans way beyond when he's supposed to.

2. Gear - bring something to get signed, of course. Footballs and jerseys are the easiest. Bring plenty of water bottles and food so that you don't pay the ridiculous inside prices, and don't risk losing your spot. Do not bring a chair unless you intend to sit on the hill or the back endzone - two places with great views, but virtually no chance of autographs. If you are going to the standing areas by the sidelines, bring a blanket to sit on instead.

3. Bring your kids! The guy in charge of running the training camp is all about getting kids involved with the Skins. There is a kids zone that is going great from everything I’ve heard. There is a special viewing area at the far endzone for kids only, so their view will not be blocked. After practice, the players choose one or two kids apiece to take onto the field and meet the most popular players, which is amazing.

4. Be prepared for heat and yelling! Things get hot with the sun beating down and having very little space to yourself, so don’t come too early if you can’t handle the conditions. Be prepared for employees to be loud, because people love to break the rules and try to ruin everybody else’s fun for their own benefit. Don’t knock the employees for the negligence of guests; most of the people working with you are unpaid volunteers!

Have fun! It's a great time once the players eventually hit the field."	t5_2r4wc	True

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvAh-IYEVZo:

Towards the end of the game, a cowboy went down with a head/neck injury. There was a long break in the game.  My buddy and I are sitting diagonally across from where the skins come out.  He suggests we go over and see if we could get a high five or anything so we do.  For those of you who haven't seen the lower level there is a little wall before you get to the 2 front rows.  He foolishly goes over while facing a security guard, I turn the other way (Game is over now btw).  For some reason taylor comes over to the guy next to me.  I'm stoked, I plat him on the shoulders, say good game and all that, not thinking to get him to sign the jersey I'm wearing.  

http://i.imgur.com/iVgjwSf.jpg

He starts to go to the tunnel when someone throws a jersey in front of him.  He stops, picks it up and starts to sign it.  I run over to where he is, and ask if he would sign mine as well.  He goes ""Allright baby!"" (I don't know why, but whatever).  And signs it across the front.

ThatChrisDodge	51	23	16	"Sure, I hope we beat those fucking fucks as much as any other Redskins fan but I also really respect those fucking fucks and the majority of Seahawks fans who have visited /r/Redskins have been super cool. We wouldn't have added user flair for all 32 teams if we didn't want rival fans to participate in threads. 

So please, be nice and respectful. Trash talking is fine, we're football fans after-all but it doesn't need to be so hateful and it certainly doesn't need to ever become personal. Please take a moment and remember we're fans, we're not out there on the field every week so there's no need to take it that personally. 

There have been a few obnoxious fans sure, and we've dealt fatal ban hammer blows to those few but I've seen just as many Redskins fans act just as obnoxious the other way. Keep that passion and fire our proud fan-base is known for but please also keep it classy.... to an extent. 

If you see fans of any other teams fans being abusive or obnoxious just report it by hitting that report button or messaging the mods and we'll be on it like a Redskins CB on a Tony Romo pass attempt. See that, that was some classy trash-talking and not once did I have to use a racial slur or drag someones sexuality into it. It's that easy folks. 

Have a good weekend and I'll see you all Sunday at the game-thread!

1375580731.0	1jnoza	A couple of observations from training camp today	easy_Money	37	8	16	"Got to watch a majority of the practice and a few things really stood out in my eyes

-Kirk Cousins looked great. Had a couple of scrimmage touchdowns including a ~ 40 yd bomb in the back of the end zone. Made several connections to Moss and it looks like they've got great chemistry. 

-Speaking of Moss, he got by far the most looks of any receiver and made some excellent grabs. 

-RGIII looked pretty good. On one play the O Line broke down and he very nimbly got loose and connected for a decent gain. However, it appeared as if he was very limited in reps, in fact at one point Cousins and Rexy took a few snaps and the drill ended and he walked up to Kyle with his hands up like ""is that it? What about my turn?""

-Orackpo looked strong, however very limited in reps.

-Kerrigan was downright explosive and mowed over just about anyone he was matched up against.

It's late for me to be the first to say congratulations to you guys for the tremendous progress the Redskins showed this year.  But let me say it anyway: congratulations.  If Griffin can stay healthy, he and Morris may be excellent for years.  And Shanahan, of course, is a proven winner who seems to be following his formula for success.

That said, the mods weren't aware of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Redskins/comments/15j4cm/cowboys_fan_here_any_bet_any_takers/) and wouldn't have supported it if we were.  He obviously is a kid or a blowhard, and this post is an embarrassment to sports fans and an affront to reality.

I won't apologize for his conduct, because of course I didn't have anything to do with it.  But this kind of post doesn't encourage the spirit of healthy competitiveness that lies at the heart of every sports rivalry.

The first Cowboys game I ever noticed was [this one](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197212310was.htm).  Over the years, I've seen a lot of excellent Cowboys/Redskins games and a lot of dogs.  I've seen each team rise and fall in precisely the manner the NFL seems to like its teams to develop.

I don't know how many years I have left (none of us do), but I anticipate a lot more entertainment from this rivalry and a lot of good-natured ribbing from fans of both sides.  If I never see or hear of another comment like this guy's, I won't mind a bit.

1346950353.0	zgg9w	Thoughts on our division rivals from last night.	AlcoholicZebra	34	3	14	"The good and the bad from the Giants-Cowboys game.

Cowboys:

* Good.  Their o-line looks bad.  The Tackles looked average and the Guards and Center looked worse.

* Good.  Murray couldn't do much until the Giants d-line completely wore down.

* Good.  Romo struggled when the pocket collapsed, but only when the outside rushers held contain.  Given how Orakpo and Kerrigan normally pass rush, this shouldn't be as much of a problem for us.

* Bad.  Romo's still Romo, he's incredibly dangerous outside of the pocket, and he'll find ways to get out of the pocket no matter what.

* Bad.  Their defense looked very good.  The corners are far improved from last season, but it's still too early to tell how good they actually are.  Giants only have 2 receivers, and Cruz had 3 drops.

* Bad.  Dez Bryant turned it up a notch, his route running looks better than I remembered.

Giants:

* Good.  Their Tackles looked atrocious in both run blocking and pass blocking.  Their Guards were also struggling, but not quite as poorly as the Tackles.  Blitzes were putting a lot of pressure on Eli.  The o-line got dominated in those 2 goalline situations.

* Good. Wilson has fumble-itis, and apparently that was also a huge problem in college.

* Good.  We can expect Cruz to rebound from his drops issues, but they still only have 2 receivers.  Mario Manningham's departure really hurt them.  Hixon had a good catch, but that's about it.

* Good.  Their secondary blew.  They had to use Justin Tryon a fair amount, yeah, the guy who couldn't make it with us.  He played terribly.  Rolle took bad angles.  Webster played so-so, but then again maybe that's just because Dez Bryant looked nasty with how he set up his routes.  Coe was meh.  They really need Amukamara back.  And the injury to the other corner, Thomas hurts them.

* Good.  Osi and Tuck weren't a factor.  Their d-line started hot but wore down heavily as the game went on.  Marvin Austin and Chris Canty might be back by the time we play them though.

* Good.  Their linebackers were not good in coverage.  On Ogletree's first TD, that was entirely because the linebackers were either completely out of position, or just a terrible defensive call.  The safeties looked like they were in Cover 2 and were where they were supposed to be, but one of the linebackers should have been deep mid.  Instead, they were all about 5-10 yards in front of the end zone, meaning Ogletree was gifted an easy opportunity to get behind them, which any WR in the league should be able to do.

* Bad.  JPP looks even more like an animal.

* Bad.  Cruz won't drop those passes again, and he was able to get open enough to trouble any defense.

* Bad.  Before Keith Rivers got hurt, he looked like he could be a threat blitzing or near the LOS.

TL;DR

Cowboys can now also vie for winning the division, but both teams showcase weaknesses we could exploit."	t5_2r4wc	True
1345516430.0	yk5es	Griffin, Cousins, and expectations.	RamsesToo	31	4	18	"So the season is almost upon us, and Skins coverage is picking up, and as usual I am compelled to chime in with my positions to counteract the media's ""crazy."" And if this is anything like last year many of you will chime in to counteract MY ""crazy,"" so here we go.

First, and this is the easiest thing to dispel, is the super dramatic locker room splitting QB controversy that totally exists right now.  Cousins went Donkey Kong on Chitown the other night. For 30 minutes of football, he's looked more poised in the pocket than Griffin has.  As everyone has pointed out, this is due in great part to the fact that he was playing the Bears 2nd and 3rd team defenders.  Cousins would have looked a lot less cool with Lance Briggs and Julius Peppers breathing down his neck.  I believe he also looks more comfortable than Griff for the same reason Andrew Luck does.  What both of them are doing now in the NFL is a LOT closer to what was asked of them in college than what was asked of Griffin.  Griff spent a whole lot of his time at Baylor taking snaps from shotgun rather than taking the ball from under center and dropping back.  Luck, Cousins, and others are simply enhancing skills they have been cultivating for years, while Griffin is picking them up from scratch.  Cousins might actually be more ""NFL ready"" than Griff based on the kind of offenses they ran, but of course the ceiling on Griffin is about a mile higher than the one on Cousins.  I'm MORE than happy to see Cousins flourish in the background.  We'll either have a suitable backup for years to come, OR he'll be showcased during blowouts, preseason games, and when injury strikes (knock on wood in hope that it never does), and some QB hungry team will give us more than the 4th rounder we spent on him.

The second insane thing is the idea that Griffin has taken a step back in this second game.  Whaaa?  He hasn't taken a step back, because he hasn't taken a step of any kind.  He's a rookie who's thrown the ball 14 times in 2 games that don't count.  This year is NOT about Robert Griffin showing us what he's got.  This is ONLY about him learning extraordinarily painful lessons.  This is about him throwing picks.  This is about him losing the ball on runs because he didn't tuck it in.  This is about him staying upright like an idiot when he should have slid.  My dad used to say ""nothing will teach a person to respect fire like getting burned.""  This year is about RGIII getting burned.  He's a rookie, and that's exactly what he's supposed to look like.  He's going to make dumb mistakes, and realistically, he's not going to look as good as Cam Newton did making them.  Griffin is extremely rough around the edges right now, and this year is about sanding those edges down.  Once he's relearned his role as a QB, THEN we'll be able to exploit his usefulness as a dual threat.

That second one is my favorite kind of prediction.  I either look like the calm, rational adult who knew what was going to happen, or I'm wrong, but screw you, buddy, my QB is doing totally awesome right now; you can't even hurt my feelings. Anyway, good luck to us all in the coming season.  Hail!"	t5_2r4wc	True

***
The Redskins are red hot after three straight division wins but still need to make up some ground in the playoff race. They'll look to do just that against a Ravens team hobbled by injuries and suspect on the road. The Redskins need this one to keep pressure on the New York Giants in the NFC EAST division race as well as stay relevant in the wild-card discussion. 

Strap in folks, it's the battle of the beltway and every game is a playoff game with four weeks remaining on the year!

I thought this couldn't be right.  I must have made some silly game choices, but I went back and reviewed, even changed some games that could be a tossup.  

You guys still came out on top.

Let's look at the Cowboys.  They're playing subpar and they have been all year.  I've watched a lot of of their games and they just don't finish games.  They play a stretch of tough games @Bengals, Steelers, and Saints and I doubt they will win any of them.  They'll beat Philly but there's almost no way they sweep you guys, at worst you guys split the series.  

To the Giants.  Because of 07 and last year the media seems to love the idea that the Giants will strengthen up in their last few games, squeak into the playoffs, then dominate their way to the superbowl.  

This won't happen this year.  Their schedule it too tough.  In fact, its possible they don't win a single game till week 17.  I'm aware they beat Falcons and Packers on the road last year in the playoffs, but I don't see both of these happening this year.  Saints have OBLITERATED the Giants in the Brees era.  

Best case they go 9-7, but if you guys take care of business against them at home, which I believe you will, you'd still have the advantage.

Best scenario for you guys, I believe you only lose 1 more game, probably to Ravens.  And even worst case you drop two games, but I have Giants with the same range (9-7 to 8-8) and if you guys take care of business against them you guys have the tiebreaker advantage.  I believe the Cowboys will at best be 8-8 and most likely worse.

I thought some of you might appreciate this from an outside perspective.  Cheers."	t5_2r4wc	True

There is no measure for how useful the following piece of information is.  **ARRIVE EARLY.**  It's late summer, and you're going to hit vacation traffic on I-95.  Yes, even on a Wednesday.  And odds are, you're parking a fair distance from the facility and walking or shuttling there.  Practice starts at 12:40 PM, and you want to be there BEFORE that.  If you live in D.C., Maryland, or NoVA and you leave after 8 AM, you are BEGGING to have a bad spot on the sideline or miss the beginning of practice entirely.  I'm going to be on the road at 7.  Get up and get going!

You also need a poncho.  There are disposable ones you can get from the supermarket.  They're dirt cheap, and you will not regret having one.  Thunderstorms can kick up pretty fast this time of year.  Be prepared.

If you don't want to budget for concessions and drinks, bring some!  There's a bag search at the entrance, but you're allowed to bring water and snacks. But there is a no glass bottle policy, I believe.


* For those who did NOT win VIP passes:

I've done extensive scouting and asked a lot of questions, but in the general area there is no real way of fencing off a place for one group of people.  The other hitch is that with people leaving from different points of origin and arriving at different times, gathering together will be tricky.  I'm trying to get self adhesive name tags with the Snoo (the Reddit alien) printed on them and some Sharpies at the social media tent so when everyone checks in, pass or no pass, you can identify yourself as being a part of this meetup, which will help us all to connect and gather up.  I really do want this event to be bigger than the very generous giveaway the team extended to us.  I will post a meetup thread on Wednesday morning to serve as a way for people to organize.  ""I'm on the left side of the far end zone, get at me!"" etc.

* For those who did win a VIP pass.

You need to pick yours up at the social media tent.  When entering the facility, [you will pass through an archway that looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/QgAj2kO.jpg)  That HAYUUGGEE tent to the left of it is the Redskins Team Store.  Just beyond THAT tent is the social media tent.  That's where you'll show your ID and receive your pass.   Then, you head on over.  It's a smaller area, gathering up should be much easier.

That's about it!  Please, PLEASE feel free to ask questions and make useful suggestions here, and again, use this thread to discuss carpooling options or your thoughts on meeting up. Richmonders, if you've got insights that I'm leaving out, clue us in!"	t5_2r4wc	True

That being said though, Manning is certainly the type to do that, but it's not the type of solution that we were hoping for.

I'm curious about which quarterbacks are going to make a name for themselves next year - Barkley seems like a solid college quarterback, but USC quarterbacks have not been faring too well in the NFL as of late.

At least we will have either Luck or RGIII going into next season (If RGIII rises to the #1 spot, great for him, but Luck has been generating hype since last offseason.) This feels like a better offseason than previous, and I wouldn't mind keeping Shanahan around, just to see which direction he is pushing the team in.

***
Greetings and salutations subscribers of /r/Redskins! I want to thank you all for being the best community in the /r/NFL family. Seriously, I've made the rounds to just about every other NFL subreddit and nearly all of them are either filled with fans stupidly arguing with each other or just inactive. We have a community filled with awesome fans that get along and submit great content consistently. 

That having been said, there are a few things we want to reiterate before the start of the season. This subreddit has grown quite a bit and will continue to do so which means we'll have an influx of new people not familiar with the posting guidelines and some basic community rules. We also expect more outside fans coming in this season during gamethreads so we've added rival team flair. 

So, here are the basics and if everyone continues to do as they have been we'll be just fine.
***
- As always, please do not downvote based on team affiliation. We want to encourage rival fans to visit and contribute in gamethreads so long as conversation remains civil and they aren't being offense or harassing anyone. 

- Anyone can create gamethreads, please refer to [/r/NFL's posting guidlines](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/help/faqs/NFL#Gamethreads) in regards to posting gamethreads.

- In fact, just follow all of the [/r/NFL guidlines](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/qm0hx/new_guidelines_for_rnfl_please_read/) and you'll be fine, our guidelines here are basically those almost verbatim. 

- No memes, we cannot delete those fast enough when we see them pop up. Please report them if you see them and in this case feel free to be judge, jury and executioner with the downvote button if it hasn't been deleted yet. We like good content that sparks good conversation, there are other places for NFL memes like [/r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu](/r/nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu) or [/r/nflcirclejerk](/r/nflcirclejerk) 

- Speaking of things we can't deleted fast enough please keep an eye out for spam, recently we've been hit with several links where OP is creating multiple accounts and submitting links to certain sports blogs to try and get hits on their site. A few that have popped up here include sportsrant and greatrealfootball or something along those lines. They went unnoticed for a little while but they're on our radar now thanks to reports and messages from /r/Redskins members. This is a problem all across the /r/NFL community as they're creating fake accounts and spamming every football sub they can. So please keep an eye out and report anything suspicious. 

- We keep an eye out as best we can but we miss things and aren't able to be logged in 24/7 so to an extent you're our eyes and ears so please report abuse, harassment, spam and any other type of violation to general guidelines and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) so we can take care of it. 

-  We want to welcome RamsesToo as our newest /r/Redskins mod. He'll be helping FatRob and myself keep watch in this amazing community and as of right now we're all set for mods but if and when we decide to add anyone else we'll take the ""we'll find you approach"".

- If you have ideas please feel free to let us know, anything you think might benefit the community we want to hear about. Feedback from the community has led to us creating awesome flair and our banners are all user created and submitted as well. 

*** 
In closing, thank you all so much for making this such an awesome community and keep it up through the 2012 season!

Can be draft picks, coaching changes, free agents, people let go....lets hear it!

Cut:  
Banks - seriously, F that dude.  As charles barkley would say, ""That dude is turruble""

Cooley - As much as I love Cooley, his role on the team has been so limited that I wouldn't be surprised that he is not brought back next season, especially with Fred Davis coming back and Paulsen being very productive in the absence of Davis.

Moss -  this might be a long shot, but I would imagine the skins would continue to try and upgrade their receiving corps this off season.  Moss, while still productive, is getting older...I just cant see them keeping him on board without asking him to take a pay cut.  I think Santana has a couple good years in him, so I am hoping that they make room for him to stay.

Jammal Brown - Did he even make it on the field at all this season?  I dont know the details of his contract, but I know it was somewhere around 20 million for 4 or 5 years.  If he isnt healthy (and can stay healthy) I couldnt imagine the Redskins keeping him.

Merriweather - Ugh....this guy has so much fire, but he is made of glass.  He was able to play for roughly 2.5 quarters this year.  



Im putting it out there right now, but I think Fletcher retires.  He had a great season, and somehow managed to play at a high level even though he was banged up for most of the season.  I think he passes the torch in the off season.



Here's to a great season guys!  Looking forward to the future."	t5_2r4wc	True

RGIII and Morris deserve all the credit they're getting, but just wanted to give some credit to Garcon.  The offense seems to function much more smoothly when he's on the field.

1352157291.0	12p10t	NOT Shanahan's fault.	cbritter93	29	6	43	"Certain sports pundits around espn studios have recently asserted that Mike Shanahan needs to go (Stephen A. Smith). I couldn't disagree more. Yes, the team is 3-6 fresh off a defeat by a 1 win team BUT what can Shanahan has done the best he has with a roster absolutely decimated by injuries. Orakpo, Garcon, Carriker, Lichtensteiger, Davis, Helu, Meriweather, the list goes on and on. Every NFL team deals with injuries, but the amount we've been dealt has been somewhat comical. Every since Snyder handed Shanahan the reigns with regards to drafting and having a big role in roster management, I've noticed a HUGE increase in the employment of logic in these decisions, a rare quality in the Snyder era. He drafted Alfred Morris, the 3rd leading rusher in the NFL in the 6th round. He made the right decision drafting RG3. He made good signings with Josh Morgan/Garcon (garcon hasn't panned out yet due to injuries but played well in the little time we've seen him), and most of all he got rid of McNabb and Haynesworthless, and other useless salary-cap rapers. Im as pissed off as anyone else, but Shanahan is not the one to point fingers at, if anyone its Jim Haslett or DeAngelo Hall.
that is all.
