While listening to the Giants game, John Miller just said that your current 42-8 stretch over the past 50 games is the best in major league baseball since 1942. Holy shit!

50 games ago you guys were 12 games below .500 — and now look at you, you fucking bastards!

I know I'm supposed to hate you guys, but this is a great story. It's good for the game.

You guys have a really swell subreddit here, it kinda makes the Padres' look and feel like a minor league team's.  Really good stuff over here.  Your team will be fine, the hitters will start hitting, and everything will take care of itself.  You guys have too good of a lineup not to be successful.  I miss Adrian.  He's good.  And Houston Street is a home run allowing bitch who really shouldn't be closing for us, so i guess that something that you guys relish on.  Vin Scully has an angelic voice and I sometimes watch Dodger streams instead of ours when we play you guys for the sake of him (shhhh).  Ugh what else can I say?  Puig is the Cuban Jesus?  At least we didn't lose the series to y'all.  Good luck in the future.  Peaceeee"	t5_2ra0i	True

Shortly after this nutty run began, I got some rather bad news about my health.  Since then, the news has gotten a bit worse.  Right now, the likely best case scenario is that I'll have to live the rest of my life with medication.  Worst case scenario is that I'm headed to organ transplantville and my lifespan just got drastically reduced. 

Before this, I was in great health.  Overnight, things came crashing down.  Obviously, this has been pretty heavy.  You guys have no idea how this run and /r/dodgers has helped keep my spirits up.  Instead of panicking and losing my shit, I spend a lot of time reading every news article and blog post out there about the Dodgers.  The goofy bullshit posts here have been essential in helping me laugh.

So, thanks a lot, Dodgers and Dodgerbros.  You guys are LITERALLY the only thing keeping me alive.  Well, maybe not, but you guys are pretty damn important.

Last year was exciting, however now there are hundreds of people on /r/orioles that haven't watched baseball in 15 years downvoting and talking down to anyone that tries to talk objectively about the team (The /r/Orioles hive mind is that all the Orioles are all-stars and Buck Showalter is the new Earl Weaver). It's fine that we have new fans, in fact I welcome it...but...I guess it doesn't help that our moderators are absentee.

 I talked to one of your members over on /r/baseball who highly endorsed the community here. I said I'd move in. It was a joke but I realized I don't have a Nat'l League team. 

So why not. 

Go Dodgers!

1375510831.0	1jm522	Reading the Yankees subreddit drama, and I wanted to take a moment to thank the mods here for making this such a nice place to be.	nayrrrrr	66	6	35	I know I don't really take part in the threads but I've been checking in here for a couple years and I've never even really noticed the mods. It's like they say about umpires, if you are doing your job right, nobody notices. So thanks guys for putting in all the work you do and making this a place where people feel like they can say anything without reprisal. So job well done and keep up the good work. It's appreciated.	t5_2ra0i	True

1375301668.0	1jg09g	So I have a bit of a confession..	jlopez24	55	11	25	"So I've always been ashamed to admit this, but I love Puig. Everything about him really just.. gets me going. From his intense energy to his amazing fielding skills, I just love everything about him. How hard he runs bases, how fast he is in the field, the power in his swings, his emotion during his celebrations, his bat flips. Ah yes! His bat flips! Every time Puig steps in the batter box I pray for a home run, nay, even a [single](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRRQhDfSWdU), to watch his legendary bat flip. I really wish every single player in the Majors did this. Runner on first, pitcher up to bat, sac bunt? Bat flip. Team down 13-0, grounder to short? Bat flip. Strike out? Bat flip. Forget to bat flip? Have ball boy bring you the bat and flip it from wherever you are. It just adds a sense of excitement. A challenge, even, to see who flips their bat the best. I know I'm a Dbacks fan, but I just really wanted to share my excitement about bat flipping to my fellow Dodgers fans.

1373484467.0	1i109e	The study of the rise and fall of Puigmania throughout MLB	Dinosauringg	58	11	39	"June 3rd, 2013. The entire MLB world is anxious to see what Yasiel Puig, Cuban mystery for the LA Dodgers, will do in his first ABs against Major League pitching. The nation hawks at his two home runs the next day, and for a week almost everyone is baseball is engulfed in the hype and great start. 

But a week later, he's still hot, and people begin to grow bored of it. 

It goes completely against all logic, when something is exciting, it should continue to excite you, but for Yasiel Puig, he stayed hot, and he stayed superhuman, but quickly much of the baseball world had it's fill. A world that was once watching with eyes wide the home run races of the 90's was growing tired of a phenom that exceeded expectations. The conversations went from ""He's hot, and exciting, but don't expect this all year"" to ""He's going to fall and I don't expect him to hit above .270.""

Despite hitting over .400 through almost the full month of June, MLB fans remained certain that he would fall and be sent back to the minors and fade into obscurity.

Even though it's now been a little over a month and he's started to walk and steal while retaining his other skills (and his .400+ BA) baseball fans expect him to be little more than Jeff Francouer. 

But why do people hate him just a few weeks after loving him? People will point to jealousy, but I think it's more than that.

They're upset that he hasn't died out. He's still making highlight plays and multi-hit games. He's still stealing bases.

They're upset that his clubhouse loves him. The man was supposed to have attitude issues, he wasn't supposed to make friends with team mates and love the fans. He was supposed to be an immature prick, he isn't allowed to hang out with Robinson Cano and CC Sabathia..

They're upset that he isn't the villain, so they started to drum up stories where he is. They're trying to find the negative, instead of the positive.

He ignored Luis Gonzales, of course he shouldn't have, but he did. He doesn't like the Diamondbacks, a team that has trash talked his, full of stars who taunt opposing players more than any other team. It's no wonder he doesn't enjoy the company of a team that called his pitcher chicken shit and finger wagged him twice, or a team that threw at his pitchers head and complained when he wasn't suspended. 

It's weird that major league fans can be so fickle when nothing has changed. The same fans that watched, holding their breath as the same three guys year after year hit steroid-aided home runs."	t5_2ra0i	True

Games remaining after this series: Dodgers: 21 Giants: 22.

If the Giants win 2 out of 3, the Dodgers will have 21 games to make up 5 1/2 games. If they sweep, no point in counting because that shit is over.

So assuming the Giants play .500 baseball (11-11) the rest of the way, the Dodgers would have to go 16-5 to force a one game playoff. Not likely. Really makes you realize how much they blew it losing these past two to San Diego.

Anyway, a Dodger sweep is obviously ideal, but winning this series is an ABSOLUTE MUST.

Imagine if the situation were reversed.  What if Matt Kemp were suddenly hit with a 50-game suspension for substance abuse?

I think we can all agree that as in love, war, and baseball this is just and acceptable. that said, I'm not a fan of flaunting that in the oppositions face or trash-talking. I believe in skewering the opposition within your own ranks, having fun, and not making it personal. at the end of the day, we're all fans of the game first and the teams second (I think). 

the fact that it came down to the second to last game for the Dodgers speaks to how hard they played. the Giants took a number of significant knocks (injuries, the whole Melky thing -- regardless of how you see it, had the potential to derail the team, etc). but with Kemp's injuries and other stuff you guys had your own problems to overcome.

the trading of sweeps was pretty amazing and I think the rivalry brings out the best in our respective teams just as, sometimes, it brings out the worst in the fans.

anyhow, I raise my glass to you guys here at /r/dodgers and thank you for a good season and for being polite hosts.

1372442506.0	1h9fq9	Let's end the debate. There are 3,299 of us. Letr's get Puig into this damn All-Star game	lesbiancocksucker	47	9	54	"To be honest, I didn't care much until the recent wave of indignant r/baseball posters, and Bruce Bochy especially, decided to be so vocal in poo-pooing Puig's legitimacy....  


And I didn't really care much even then.....but just imagine him looking like a star on a field of All-Stars? Imagine him hitting the game winning homer? Imagine if the Dodgers made the playoffs and used that home field advantage?  

All of this is crazy to say, but Puig's growing legend has been unbelievable as it is. This can only make it grow.  

As of June 23, Puig was not in the top 15 in Outfield balloting. We can't count on getting him into the game in **any** way besides voting him in.  

The third spot, as of 5 days ago, had 2.3 million votes.  

How much can /r/dodgers contribute to his total? 500,000?  

I'm going to assume that half of us participate...that's 1650 fans voting.  

Now, let's say we all use 10 email accounts to vote 35 times for each account. That's 350 votes each, totaling 577,500 votes. That's a huge chunk. I'll be using more than 10 accounts myself.  

The whole stuffing the box is kind of lame....but when the Giants are trying to vote in every single position, what the hell? How do we look if we can't even vote in the guy who has almost single handedly turned our season around?  

The Dodgers are feeding off his energy. The kid deserves it. Let's do this. "	t5_2ra0i	True

And I understand that a lot of is literally due to geographical reasons, most of the major studios/papers/etc. are based on the east coast. The numbers/ratings probably show more interesting baseball with the east coast teams than the west coast, blah blah blah. I get it. It happens.

But...

We're 14-6 in the month of May. On a six-game winning streak. 7-2 *without* Matt Kemp. There seems to be a new hero each night. Winning *with* great pitching, winning *in spite of* our pitching, winning with rookies, etc. etc.

Here are some screenshots of the baseball pages of some major sports websites (just after 8am, Los Angeles time):

* **[ESPN.com](http://i.imgur.com/Uk66K.jpg)** - A headline on the right-hand column, the Dodger Stadium fight ahead of our comeback win.

* **[Yahoo Sports](http://imgur.com/2x3sa)** - Yahoo's baseball page always seems to highlight the Dodgers pretty well.

* **[CBS Sports](http://imgur.com/Ni8Sx)** - Second line on ""Top Headlines""

* **[MLB.com](http://imgur.com/dzDxe)** - Second line in ""Latest Headlines."" I think at the time of that screen grab, we were the second in that slideshow.

* **[CNNsi.com](http://imgur.com/jC0yc)** - Only mention of the Dodgers is regarding the fight at the stadium.

God, just imagine if we were the Yankees, Phillies or Red Sox. The headlines would be screaming each day about how incredible we are, ""how in the world are we doing it?!?!,"" with all sorts of 'analysis' on how bright the Dodgers future looks, a new hero being hailed each night, etc.

Anyway. Most importantly, I'm incredibly happy with the way we've been playing. I'm sure all of our players have gained confidence in knowing that we can win games *without* Matt Kemp and knowing how much better they'll be once they Kemp comes back. And Kemp, of course, knowing that he doesn't have to rush back.

&gt;
&gt;But I’ll never say anything bad about Vin Scully, especially after what I saw Wednesday. Scully walked over to the Giants clubhouse in the afternoon to congratulate Bruce Bochy and wish him luck in the postseason. Bochy was on the phone and Scully, a legend, waited patiently in a corner as a few coaches came over to shake his hand. He left before getting a chance to talk to Bochy, but made sure to stop by and leave a message with one of the coaches.
&gt;
&gt;“Please congratulate him, and tell him that I wish you guys the best of luck in the postseason,” Scully said.
&gt;That’s some serious class.

And as the season winds down, I want to say a special thank you to those users who I see here and on /r/baseball frequently and consistently, like Fustrate, Atraktape, ShakeNBakey, canada_dryer, LeeroyJenkins, Unexpected_Finale, and KevinDurden, just to name a few. I'm proud to be associated with a fan base that includes you guys. You keep it informative, respectful, and classy, and have a passion for this franchise that I can safely say matches mine, no easy feat ;). I feel like even though we've never met in person we still know each other, and that's what reddit as a whole is aimed at, so it's great to see.

In addition, I want every visitor to this subreddit to show some appreciation for the moderators. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but I believe the number of subscribers to /r/Dodgers has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, and they have done a fantastic job with the design and look of the page. They've added the banner, upcoming and recent schedule, and the standings to the page, cleaned up and added tons of relevant links to the sidebar, added copious amounts of options for flair and turned upvotes to upVins and downvotes to downBarrys. They added official game chat threads to keep us all talking and together. They don't tolerate the douchebags that give our fan base a bad name and openly welcome any fan to participate in our threads. All the aesthetic changes took place in the course of a few months, and they've all done an amazing job in regards to that and everything else. A tip of my hat to all of you.

No matter the outcome, this season has been one to remember. It's the most franchise changing year since the FOX takeover and Piazza trade, and I can't wait to see what lies in wait for us and the team in the offseason. To r/Dodgers, my favorite subreddit of them all.

~Sincerely, EnsignObvious

1361152001.0	18q2xn	Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw now the best starting pitching duo in baseball - ESPN Insider	RanByMyGun	42	6	7	"When the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Zack Greinke this offseason, he gave them -- along with lefty Clayton Kershaw -- one of the top front ends of a rotation in baseball. Together, the duo is arguably the best one-two punch in the game, a pair truly capable of winning four games in a seven-game series.

Are they the best in the game? I decided to pore through some advanced metrics (and sprinkle in a little subjectivity) to determine the top five duos in the game right now.

To determine these rankings, I selected the top two of each rotation based on the player's projected WAR totals, courtesy of Dan Szymborski's ZiPS system, which has just finished running over at FanGraphs.

I also took the combined WAR (FanGraphs' version) of each duo for the past three seasons. I use three seasons, because any one season can be subject to statistical flukes, so when possible -- as it is here -- three years makes for a better sample.

However, WAR isn't the end-all be-all, so we want a couple of other metrics as well. A pitcher's peripheral statistics, such as strikeouts and walks, often hold a great deal of predictive value, but rather than dividing them by each other, as K/BB does, it's better to subtract the two percentages from each other. This not only gives it more predictive value (which you can read more about), but it also makes more sense intuitively, as you are using the same sample in your denominator -- total batters faced. (For a full statistical breakdown, check scroll to the bottom.)

Finally, we want to have a projected rate stat to account for the fact that not all pitchers are projected to have the same workload. For instance, ZiPS projects Gio Gonzalez to toss 200 innings this year, but projects Kershaw to toss 221 2/3, a large difference. Therefore, we'll use the ZiPS projected ERA for each duo. By using all four of these metrics, we can get a more complete picture of how the duos have performed, and how they may be expected to perform.

Here are the top five pitching duos in baseball right now:

1. Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke

Indeed, the Dodgers' new duo is the No. 1 team on the list. No pair of pitchers that a team can put together can match the 10.4 WAR that ZiPS projects Kershaw and Greinke to achieve this season. The Nats might come close if Strasburg were pegged for more innings pitched, but it remains to be seen if the nanny state Washington placed him in will lead to the 200-inning season they expect from him.

Like the Phillies, Los Angeles has a pair of very efficient pitchers. It's become de rigeur to doubt Greinke, but he has been worth at least 4.0 WAR (per FanGraphs) in each of the past five seasons, giving him an exemplary track record. It's that track record that makes him more bankable than Scherzer or Strasburg, who have just a single season of domination under their belts. And while Kershaw didn't match his brilliant 2011 season in the same fashion that Verlander did, he joins Verlander as one of two pitchers to notch a WAR projection north of six wins.

The Dodgers have the best balance of past track record and future projection, and that puts them in position to tip the scales in their favor. L.A. may not have the best overall rotation, but with Kershaw and Greinke, they are going to be tough to beat.

.2. Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels

You could make the argument that Roy Halladay deserves to be placed here rather than Hamels, but coming off a down year, Hamels has a higher projected WAR than does Halladay. And certainly Hamels is no slouch, as among the No. 2 starters as defined by this exercise, only Mat Latos has a higher projected WAR for 2013.

Lee and Hamels form the most efficient pairing. Both rarely waste bullets, particularly Lee, whose 3.9 percent walk rate is easily the game's lowest over the past three years. Over those past three years, they have been the most valuable duo, and there is little reason to expect much of a drop-off this season. Lee received attention for his drop in wins last season, but if there's any reason for worry among Phillies fans, it's that both his K-rate and swinging strike percentage fell last season. But he also was able to limit his walks more, which dampened most of the negative effect.

.3. Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer

Last season was Scherzer's coming-out party, as the young righty -- who was part of the famed three-way trade that also involved Curtis Granderson, Austin Jackson and Ian Kennedy -- saw his strikeout rate skyrocket. Instead of making contact on more than 78 percent of the pitches they swung at, opposing hitters were only able to connect on 74 percent of Scherzer's pitches in 2012, a number that was good for fourth in the game among qualified starters.

As for Verlander, he essentially duplicated his Cy Young Award-winning season, though the instinct of writers who wanted to want to craft a different narrative led them to select David Price for the honor instead. Still, few are going to do it better than Verlander, who ZiPS projects to have the most WAR among starting pitchers this season.

.4. Gio Gonzalez and Stephen Strasburg

Strasburg is at once the reason to be wary and optimistic for the Nationals. There isn't a starter in baseball who has a better FIP- projection than Strasburg's 58 FIP- heading into this season. But Strasburg also has the thinnest track record, thanks to Tommy John surgery that cost him most of the 2011 season.

As a result, he has just just 251 1/3 innings pitched in the majors, and not one season with 30 starts. On the other side is Gonzalez, who made a lot of strides last season but still walked batters at a rate above that of league average. The two may top this chart a year from now, but at the moment it is prudent to exercise a little caution.

.5. Jered Weaver and C.J. Wilson

Weaver and Wilson have been very productive over the past three years, and likely will be again this season. Both rank in the top 10 in WAR over the past three seasons, placing them in the top five as a duo. But where they fail to reach the top is in their strikeout and walk ability.

Collectively, their strikeout and walk rates are middling, though the walk rate can be laid at the feet of Wilson much more so than Weaver. Though Weaver doesn't walk many, he does a poor job of keeping the ball on the ground, but thanks to his ballpark and outfield defense, this isn't the issue for him that it would be on a different team.

We've had the same banner since early last year, and as cool as it is, we (your humble moderators) think it's time for a change.

After months of hard work (aka procrastination), and minutes of typing, the time is upon us! We want to see what you, the Best Damn Redditors in the Universe, can come up with. Should it have our current boatload of stars? Legends of the past? Cornelius? You decide.

Judging will be completely unfair and biased... meaning we'll pick the one we like the best ;) or if there are more than one that stick out, we'll give them quasi-equal time in the header. Remember this is a benevolent dictatorship, so I/we can do whatever I/we want! On the flip side, if all we get are images of Juan Pierre, we'll forget this ever happened :)

**To enter, submit your header as a regular submission in this sub** so you at least get karma out of it. Then, **[message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDodgers)** to make sure we know about it.

**Requirements:**

- There must be a blank-ish space on the left side large enough for Snoo (the reddit alien) to fit in. He's a separate image that sit on top of the header.
- It should fade to a solid color, preferably black, on the right side. Our header is aligned on the left side of the screen, and if you have a huge monitor, an abruptly cut image looks tacky.
- It should be around 170 pixels tall, and at least 1300 pixels wide.

**Prizes are...** hmm. Credit for your contribution, of course. And everyone who enters gets some link karma out of it, hopefully. If there's one we absolutely love, there might even be a physical prize of some sort!

**Tips:**

- Use your browser's developer tools to insert your image as the header here to see how it'll look.
- Score more runs than your opponents. Oh wait, that's just a tip for the Dodgers...
- Have fun (ya, that's original, Fustrate!)

1369932801.0	1fcgmb	Clayton Kershaw projected by ESPN to win the most games this season (20 games) [ESPN Insider]	BaronVonChang	36	4	18	"Unlike home runs and stolen bases and most offensive statistics, for that matter, pitcher wins are not a good gauge of a player's true ability. They just aren't. We could compare myriad sets of pitchers in this space with similar statistics in ERA, WHIP, strikeout rate and more, and then you'd see that some of these guys have five or six wins, while others inexplicably have two or three. There's Matt Moore and Patrick Corbin off to monster starts and Cole Hamels sputtering away sans run support. I can't make the case Hamels has been better, but just because someone has or hasn't won games through 10 starts tells us nothing about the remaining 22 or so starts. 

So it is that I'll take a shot at predicting the final leaderboard in pitchers' wins. I know it's silly, but it's fun, and it continues the theme of projection week, with home runs and stolen bases already off the board. This will not be a ranking of Player Rater value, but rather just wins, and hopefully this will give you an idea of which pitchers I like more than others. 


* 1 (tie) Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers (20 projected wins): He's the best pitcher in the game, for both real-life and fantasy purposes, and I see him becoming more fortunate in the wins category as the season progresses and his team modestly improves.


* #1 (tie) Yu Darvish, Texas Rangers (20): Um, he's pretty good, too! He gets plenty of run support, and as we've seen, he's capable of pitching deeper into games. I say Darvish wins the strikeout title as well. 


* 3 Adam Wainwright, St. Louis Cardinals (19): Darvish was my AL Cy Young pick back in Feburary, and here was my NL pick. No reason to switch now! Wainwright has been a big winner before, but more important, he should reach 230 innings again. More innings, more shots for wins. 


* 4(tie) Matt Moore, Tampa Bay Rays (18): He's obviously off to a great start when it comes to wins, and while he has been a bit fortunate considering his walk rate, there's room for improvement. I'm selling high on Corbin, but not so much with Moore. 


* 4 (tie) Jordan Zimmermann, Washington Nationals (18): Similarly, Zimmermann's strikeout rate has room for considerable growth based on his 2012 figures, so while his xFIP tells us regression is ahead, he'll keep winning games for a team that is about to take off. 


* 4 (tie) Lance Lynn, Cardinals (18): Obviously I see the Cardinals continuing to thrive this season. Watch Lynn pitch and he doesn't seem special. He even lost his rotation spot briefly last season. But he also won 18 games, and the Cardinals have the bullpen to hold his leads. I think he wins 18 again. 


* 4 (tie) Jon Lester, Boston Red Sox (18): Nothing in his numbers concerns me, and he actually has produced a consistent xFIP over the past few years. The team around him, however, is much improved. This gift will keep on giving, and he'll win more than talented teammate Clay Buchholz. 


* 8 (tie) Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander, Detroit Tigers (17 each): Yeah, Scherzer has a microscopic WHIP and more strikeouts while Verlander is putting way too many men on base, but I say they end up in the same place for the eventual AL Central champs. 


* 8 (tie) CC Sabathia and Hiroki Kuroda, New York Yankees (17): The last time the hefty lefty failed to win half of his starts in a season was 2008, when he still won 17 games. He'll do it again here in 32 starts. Teammate Kuroda is more of a health concern at 38, but he's pitching better than last season, when he was healthy enough to win 16 games. 


Best of the rest: There's nothing wrong with Corbin, but it's hard to imagine him keeping up this wins pace, and the team's bullpen is a looming issue as well. Well, unless you think Heath Bell is reliable. … The nightmare second half for Justin Masterson last season (5.60 ERA) is still on my mind. … I thought about Chicago White Sox lefty Chris Sale and right-hander Jake Peavy, but isn't it wishful thinking to expect more than 30 starts for each? … Like the White Sox, New York Mets ace Matt Harvey pitches for a below-average team, and while not every guy on a bad team fails to win, it's also tough to expect Harvey to keep his ERA this low for six months. He might not even get the chance to pitch regularly in September. … As for Mr. Hamels, all he needs to do is see how many wins Cliff Lee earned in 2012, because he's that guy this year. By the way, I say Lee wins 15 this year. … I want to pick James Shields to win in the high-teens, but he just has too far to go at this point. … Same with Cincinnati Reds ace Johnny Cueto, though I like his team better.

last update

- /u/CynCity323 has organized a group seating/food deal for us. 
- so for now, we are scratching off the picnic/potluck idea. 
- please go to http://www.reddit.com/r/Dodgers/comments/1f1ecs/group_vs_suite_the_list/ and sign up!



**UPDATE 2.0**
May 24th, 2013 15:35

- Thank you for participating in survey. We had total 40 responses and this is the result. http://bit.ly/1agOLp2
- The date has been set to ***July 27th, 2013 Saturday***
- We are not going to be sitting all together, since we will be gathering before the game.
- I am in process of bringing in some sponsors for this meet-up. In order to do so, we need to make this meet-up big. Big, as in 150+ people showing up. Sponsors are not necessary and is NOT the priority for this meet-up. But I think it will be very cool to get some recognition. (with that said, does anyone have connection to Dodgers or any corporate who might be interested?)
- I am going to make another survey/spreadsheet for things we need for the picnic, and what people are bringing for the potluck
- Mods, please update the link/text on top with the new date.


**UPDATE 1.3**
May 18th, 2013 23:31

- I've gotten 32 survey responses so far. 18 more, then we will have our official date.

- If the response number does NOT reach 50 by May 24th, I will go ahead and pick the date with most vote.


**UPDATE 1.2**

- Thank you for the sticky link!
- I will close the survey once I get about 50 responses

**UPDATE 1.1**
Please go to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jDEzu-hoKuxyWIdcwAKAdbZsI6B5Un6qm8skp1cGxzg/viewform

and let me know which dates are good for you



**UPDATE 1.0**

- it will be one of the Saturday games
- i am looking into which Saturday game has good ticket price, so we can all sit together like last time.
- /u/Ryan3772 suggested a Softball event, which we can arrange separately.Ryan, will you take charge on this?

-------------------------------------------------


Let's be honest,
we all had a blast at the mega meetup (except the those who couldn't make it)

Since our meetup, I've been thinking about the next one.
so here's my idea,

I think one word I had in mind was 'family'.  

the rough idea is this, 

- picnic/pot luck BBQ at the park (BYOB and BOYM)
- chill, play catch, etc
- game at 6pm

this means, you can bring your kids, and don't have to be 21+ join the pre-game festivity
Good thing is, there's a park really close to the stadium, where we can easily walk up to the stadium.


to make sure to have as many people as possible at the meet up, we should set a date sometime in July/Aug/September.  Doing so will give plenty of time for people who are coming from far away.

what do you guy think?
