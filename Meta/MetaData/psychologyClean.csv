The more and more we hear about the TSA in the news, the more I'm inclined to see that they aren't a regulated security body, but rather a stop-gap measure to promote a presence of ""concern and security"" while also burning money like its their job. 

With the latest story of the pat-down of a 4year old in a Kansas airport, I feel that I can pose an argument that the TSA appears to be a government ran copy of the Stanford Prison Experiments. [relevant materials](http://www.prisonexp.org/)

This isn't supposed to be a discussion about the mishandling of a government body, but a discussion about the similarities between them.

Perhaps it is a reflection on some of the institutes that people have or have not studied in but I see a lot of comments answering questions lack proper research and insight and have also strayed away from the principles of scientific validity. I have no problem with lay psychologists commenting on this subreddit but generally lay psychologist are not up to date with current findings in psychology. 

It seems to me that people overly refer to 1) Freud and Jung, 2) Attachment Theory and 3) Cognitive Dissonance to explain almost every psychological phenomenon under the sun. To the lay person who comes here looking for a valid and reliable answer to their questions I would certainly argue that Freud and Jung, moreso Freud are outdated and completely pseudoscientific, attachment theory does not explain everything in later life and cognitive dissonance does not answer every question about attitudes. Comments that frequently refer to these ideas do in some cases propagate psychological misinformation which does nothing for the reputation of the discipline. My headache is already painful enough from hearing people babble about the id, the subconscious and the oedipus complex that I'd rather not hear from it on reddit, however this seems to be a subreddit where it happens.

/r/psychology could be a great subreddit but these type of comments drive me away from it to other subreddits like /r/Neuropsychology , /r/neuroscience , /r/cogsci  and /r/BehaviorAnalysis where almost every comment made is supported with a scientific article or journal. This could be a great subreddit where current psychological articles are discussed and argued. It could also be a crossroads/meeting point for the different branches of psychology but sadly it is not. 

I appreciate the work the mods do and the time they give to keep this subreddit going but I would also appreciate rules regarding posting comments and a comment removal system for pseudoscience like on /r/askscience . 

Please comment for a good discussion.

tldr; I have a beef with how people answer wide ranging questions on this subreddit with almost the same theoretical standpoint everytime. Psychology is a science, not a discipline of philosophers."	t5_2qhcz	True

1343538160.0	xbwyu	Would r/psychology be interested in seeing videos I created while in a state of psychosis?  I am schizophrenic. 	fearachieved	646	106	89	"My goal in life is to study the mind.  I realize that I may become my own biggest ally in this endeavor.  About a year and a half ago, I overdosed on crystal meth, and launched into a period of psychosis (during which time I was completely sober) that lasted for about a year.  

I am still not completely recovered, but am much better now.  You see, the problem is, I have always had mental issues, ever since I can remember.  My family has a history of schizophrenia to boot (mom and grandma).  So basically I have been and will continue to deal with these issues possibly for the rest of my life.  

As of now, I have been in psychiatric care for about a year total, though it was very on and off (I kept ceasing to go, because I wanted to hold onto the belief I could fix myself).  I was very recently diagnosed with schizophrenia.  

During my period of most intense psychosis, I hallucinated often, experienced the worst terror I have ever experienced in my life, was extremely paranoid, and created elaborate delusions to explain what was happening.  I wrote constantly, and never talked to anyone save my parents and sister. Socializing was pretty much impossible.  I couldn't talk to my old friends, because I had forgotten how to be the person they knew.   

Right now, I still haven't looked back at what I wrote.  I am afraid that I am still too unstable to be able to look at it without believing it again.  

I have not watched the videos either.  I know what they contain generally though.  As I never talked to anyone about my feelings, what I was going through, etc, I really wanted to document what I was going through on my camera.  I pretty much talked to my future self.  I felt like I was on a mission to tell my future self things at times.  I talked things out because saying them out loud helped me think about them.  And if I had them on camera I knew that I could prove the thoughts had actually happened.  

So, I'm wondering....if I uploaded them to youtube, do you think they would be worth watching?  Do you think they need context?  Should I also somehow work in what I was like before/after this period of time?  I'm looking for ideas...also wondering if it is a good idea at all to make these public.  

I plan to recover.  I plan to return to UC Berkeley, my beloved school which for now I am forced to be separated from.  I plan to go back and finish my degree in cognitive science.  But for now, I feel I may be of use to others interested in studying schizophrenia.

1. The source of the research and the funding

2. The researchers who had contact with the participants

3. The individuals or objects studied and how they were selected

4. The exact nature of the measurements made on questions asked

5. The setting in which the measurements were taken

6. Differences in the groups being compared, in addition to the factor of interest

7. The extent or size of any claimed effects or differences.

Taken from *Seeing Through Statistics* by Jessica Utts

**In addition, you need to question sources that:**

Are funded by someone selling something

Uses tricks (distortions of graphs, relative phrasing like ""twice as likely"") to make results look more dramatic.

Don't include statistics behind averages (i.e.: error bars)

Are based on personal testimony

Don't cite sources

**TL;DR:** Just because some jackwagon has ""doctor"" in front of his name does't mean he isn't speculating. Speculation ≠ science.

DucoNihilum	489	92	124	"We've reached a big milestone since this sub started, and with so many subscribers we risk diluting the content from where it should be.

A lot of posts in this subreddit lately don't really drive home the scientific spirit that I personally think this subreddit should have. 

I've tried moderating them in the past, however I have been increasingly more busy - and with just two moderators this is a lot to handle. Not to mention that there is some disagreement about the rules, even within moderators.

So as a community, I Think we should discuss the current rules, and where we want to see things go. Then, potentially recruit another moderator who agrees to abide by these rules with the two current moderators.

I can tell you that the 1 one moderator, who apparently started this subreddit, has not done any moderator actions in the past several months to several years. I personally have never seen him do anything since I started modding this sub, but maybe I just don't pay attention.

I can tell you that the number 2 moderator hasn't done any moderator actions in 2 weeks.

I can tell you that I personally have not done any in a hand full of months. 

I have been very busy with things lately so I haven't been able to respond to questions or remove spam or unqualified posts as much. I would still like to contribute to this subreddit, as a moderator, driving it in the right direction but we need consensus as to what is and is not acceptable material. Honestly I have grown somewhat apathetic. We need to find out what rules work and STICK WITH THEM. 

I helped create the rules in the sidebar excluding image posts, psychological advice, and pseudo-science. 

I think these rules should stand and should be ENFORCED. Now, what does the community think? "	t5_2qhcz	True

1344345713.0	xtl8j	Do you believe there's a lot of undiagnosed people who have strong enough mental abilities to cope with their mental illness?	Commander_Cute	378	84	176	"The topic is pretty poorly written but this is a subject I haven't been fully able to process clearly in my head either. It is something that interests me very much, though, so I want to write about it even though it might not appear fully clear to you. I hope you can get the idea.

For a long time I've pondered if amongst us exist people who for example have schizophrenic features but they never come across as mentally ill because they're able to cope with their symptoms. This idea arises from my own life: my family roots have history of schizophrenia and I had bad ""delusion attacks"" when I was just a child. The delusions affected me in a way that I couldn't sleep at night time or be alone at home. Well, I never talked about them to anybody and slowly the delusional thinking withered away (in about 1-2 years from when it started). I still sometimes have mild attacks but somehow I can ""stand outside"" when these attacks take place. In other words, I guess they don't drive me fully delusional because I can deal with them with strong meta cognition. Other symptoms I have is meaningless word chains looping in my head which can cause mild apathy.

I wonder if these kind of symptoms can be called ""mental illnesses"" if they don't clearly cause any harm to the individual. It's pretty certain, though, that if I ever talked with a psychologist about these symptoms, they would very likely consider at least some sort of mild diagnosis for me. 

So, can strong mental abilities be a bless for some people who genetically are very much likely to have some mental illness and probably already have had symptoms of such illness? Can some people just ""deal with"" their mental illness in a way that it doesn't make their life less enjoyable - or it might even make it more enjoyable? I've read definitions of mental illnesses, though, and there often reads that it's only illness if it worsens the individual's life's sensibleness."	t5_2qhcz	True

1341178421.0	vw753	What I've learned as a research assistant in a clinical psych study		319	39	51	"I'm part of a clinical psych study regarding psychological stress, resilience, and overall long-term health. My role includes interviewing participants and transcribing recorded interviews to text files. I hear the life stories of dozens upon dozens of people from all different backgrounds, and it has made me realize a few things:

-Everyone has a story, and no matter how that person may seem in passing, it's likely that we have no idea what others have been through and what they have overcome. Do your best never to make assumptions in passing, because you never know if that guy taking forever in line in Starbucks suffers everyday after sacrificing his mental health for the sake of a loved one. 

-This is not an absolute rule, but many people who have been through the worst turn out to be the best. Based on my experience, the participants who report the most horrifying stories are also the most aware of others. Empathy, compassion, and interestingly enough, pragmatism leaks through their thoughts and actions. It is inspiring. 

-In daily life, many of us operate as if everyone else is a total dumbass. A lot of us lean towards cynicism, especially when we watch some obese man in Chipotle tear the employees new ones because he didn't get extra sour cream. However, the more I listen to these stories, the more firmly I set my belief that cynicism isn't a totally justified view. There is a balance. 

I just felt like sharing. I know this has nothing to do with the clinical purpose of our project, however I love the fact that working in this study has helped make me more conscientious and inspired to better myself. "	t5_2qhcz	True

So I end up staying up, but still don't actually accomplish anything.

Basically, I go to work, do my job, go home, eat dinner, then sit on my ass doing absolutely nothing for the next several hours.  For some reason I just wouldn't go to bed until the wee hours of the night.

It's difficult to explain, but I think I tell myself, ""you haven't done anything today.  Do something, then you can go to bed,"" except that's as far as I get.  I don't actually end up doing anything, I just sit on my lazy ass and browse reddit or jerk off.  Then it's 2AM and I think, ""well, it's too late to do anything now, so I'll go to bed.""

Then I started going to the gym.  Yeah, working out made me tired, but I think there's more to it than that.  I feel like I actually did something worthwhile.  I don't feel like another day went by where I did absolutely nothing for myself or anyone else.  I can go to bed at 11 or 12 because I feel accomplished.

It sounds like a generic nature-nurture problem and I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.

To say that there's a ""nature"" element to pedophilia then I guess you need some biological connections, things that couldn't have just come from bad parenting and abuse. They could have come from inheriting genes for pedophilia, or experiencing an environment in the womb that led to pedophilia, or a combination of both.

Apparently there are some. I'm just going off this article I read here: http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/local/la-me-pedophiles-20130115. A summary of the biological connections is basically:

* 30% of pedophiles are left-handed or ambidextrous, triple the general rate

* pedophiles are nearly an inch shorter on average

* pedophiles are below the average IQ by 10 points

* In one study, compared with men with criminal histories but no sex offenses, pedophiles had less white matter, the connective circuitry of the brain. Also seeing a child sets off the same neural response that men typically experience around an attractive woman.

EDIT: For the above 4, as pointed out below in the comments, remember that the the samples where this data come from might not be representative.

* There was a case of a man who suddenly had pedophilic urges around the same time he had a brain tumor. They went away, but then when the tumor came back, the urges did too.

* The treatments don't work and it can't be cured, just like you can't make straight people gay or gay people straight. (because you can't just change their brain structure?)

What do you think about it being considered a sexual orientation?

EDIT: Some of the mentioned studies I could find.

http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/the-psychology-of-paedophilia/4717436

His response is:

&gt; ""People, I don't think, learn to be sexually interested in children; we learn not to be, by and large. So, acting on sexual interest in a child is really a failure of restraint.""

This is the first time I've heard paedophilia described not as an aberration, but something that is common to everyone, but from which most of us have *learned to restrain ourselves*. It seems to indicate that any relative lack of child sexual abuse is simply a cultural phenomenon.

Is this ""failure of restraint"" idea commonly held in psychology? And, if so, why is it not spoken about more openly, instead of the commonly heard view that paedophilia (as in the attraction as separate to the abuse) is an aberrant condition?

From Steven Pinker's ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"":
 
""One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the illusion of the unified self comes from the neuroscientists Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Sperry, who showed that when surgeons cut the corpus callosum joining the cerebral hemispheres, they literally cut the self in two, and each hemisphere can exercise free will without the other one's advice or consent. Even more disconcertingly, the left hemisphere constantly weaves a coherent but false account of the behavior chosen without its knowledge by the right. For example, if an experimenter flashes the command ""WALK"" to the right hemisphere (by keeping it in the part of the visual field that only the right hemisphere can see), the person will comply with the request and begin to walk out of the room. But when the person (specifically, the person's left hemisphere) is asked why he just got up, he will say, in all sincerity, ""To get a Coke""--rather than ""I don't really know"" or ""The urge just came over me"" or ""You've been testing me for years since I had the surgery, and sometimes you get me to do things but I don't know exactly what you asked me to do."" Similarly, if the patient's left hemisphere is shown a chicken and his right hemisphere is shown a snowfall, and both hemispheres have to select a picture that goes with what they see (each using a different hand), the left hemisphere picks a claw (correctly) and the right picks and shovel (also correctly). But when the left hemisphere is asked why the whole person made those choices, it blithely says ""Oh, that's simple. The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and you need a shovel to clean out the chicken shed. **The spooky part is that we have no reason to think that the baloney-generator in the patient's left hemisphere is behaving any differently from ours as we make sense of the inclinations emanating from the rest of our brains. The conscious mind --the self or soul-- is a spin doctor, not the commander in chief""**.

I'm posting because today i've essentially come to an understanding that i need my meds. 

I've been prescribed Abilify(aripriprazole) for some time now, it's effect is very much subliminal, so much so that i doubt to myself whether i need it, however, whenever i cease ""taking the pills"" i unerringly never fail to deteriorate, becoming very ""unstable"".

It's not that i've had a lightening bolt realisation here, it's more a case that after a prolonged period of association with very helpful mental health workers which ended recently, the penny has now finally dropped, i need head-meds as much as i need other medication for my physical ailments (they always said as much)

The struggle against taking medication was wrong-headed, i thought abilify was putting a barrier between me and reality, now i frame it as a matter of me taking personal responsibility for my own mental health by taking medication rather than skeptically disavowing their efficacy. 

Furthermore, i wanted to dissociate myself from the whole circus concerning mental health, with labels as such like. I don't now appropriate a relevant label for myself - i wouldn't know what would apply anyhow, but now i acknowledge i have a deficit that mean i can't make it on my own.

Anyhow, i don't seek to offer universally applicable advice here, all i guess i'm saying is if the tablets work for you keep on taking them.

tl;dr - was ill, decides to keep on taking meds as a preventative measure.

Thanks for reading

Potential positives

* Direct unwanted advice questions away from /r/psychology

 
* Allow users to get some simple advice from professionals, or at least enthusiasts. There could be a tag describing the 'level of dedication' so to speak of people who answer questions. EG: PhD, BS, PsyD etc verified by mods. 


* Separates  psychological advice from communities that may be less capable of doing so, or at the very least may be less targeted toward these kinds of questions. 

Potential negatives

* Legal issues if someone gives some terrible advice

* I feel like the advice would mostly end in '.... and I can't really help you on the internet, you should see a real therapist'

* People feeling like the quick snippet on Reddit would replace any needed therapy

&gt;I wish it would have been another, how long will they mourn me my brother?

This got me thinking: why wish for somebody else to die instead? Why not just wish to, you know, not die? And the more I thought about it, the more I started seeing just how prevalent this idea is. When Lincoln was assassinated, Mary Todd was heard crying that it should have been her instead of him. And of course, TV Tropes has a whole section about this line of thinking, which they call [""Balancing Death's Books](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancingDeathsBooks)."" So it seems to me that there is a pervasive view in society that when it's somebody's ""turn to go,"" that a death must occur, even if it's the death of somebody besides the one who's ""meant"" to die. 

Why do we see this line of thinking? Honestly I'm not sure, but it reminds me of what economists call a [Zero Sum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). In a zero sum game, a win for me is a loss for you, and vice versa. If we both bet money at a hand of poker, and you win and take the whole pot, that's a zero sum game. And similarly, it seems to me that sometimes we have a tendency to view death in the same way. If somebody is supposed to die, only the death of another person can prevent it. Deaths can be exchanged, but only for another death. Someone dies so somebody else can live. Somebody lives because somebody else died instead of them. Zero sum. 

But I'm a cognitive scientist, not an economist, and the psychology of death isn't one of my research areas. So what do you think? Does this belief that death must ""balance the books"" reflect a zero-sum mindset? And if so, what does that tell us about how we view death and dying?

My primary interest has been in clinical psychology (specifically going for a PHD) but after endless hours of research and talking with professionals, I'm not so sure anymore. Some other options I've been considering were an MSW as they can essentially do very similar things a clinical psychologist could do, the only thing I'm worried about is the poor salary. I don't want to go the Psy.D route as these programs are just way too expensive. Unfortunately as the years have gone by, now I'm not even so sure I want to pursue something psychology related (I've been looking up various options such as physical therapy, speech pathology, and even a physician). Ughh, I'm a total wreck. I hope this isn't as discombobulated as I think it is, but if anyone can give me some insight on this I would greatly appreciate it. Preferably someone who has either gone through something similar or is involved in one of these fields I mentioned (particularly clinical psychology and social work).

EDIT: I just wanted to clarify that I do intend on pursuing something on the graduate level, just no idea what yet :(

UPDATE: Wow, did not expect to get this much feedback from you guys, you've all been so much help, i love how caring this community is.

Hey there /r/psychology! I love psychology and I love discussing psychology. I also realize that effective communication of findings to the general public lags about 50 years. I know that most redditors are better informed than this, but I was still compelled to start a series of posts summarizing findings in psychology. I chose all my favorite articles, put them in a pool, and drew out Donnellan, Burt, Levendosky, &amp; Klump, 2008. I think it is a good balance of broad and interesting. The original idea for this series was “Articles You Should Know,” but since a large part of science is replication, a series of articles replicating the same finding is far more valuable than any single article.

**Articles:** Donnellan, M. B., Burt, S. A., Levendosky, A. A., &amp; Klump, K. L. (2008). ""Genes, personality, and attachment in adults: A multivariate behavioral genetic analysis"": Erratum. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34(4), 578-578.

And many more!

**Research Question:** To what extent do genetics contribute to personality?

**Method:** Twin studies work like this: we take a bunch of twins - some identical (MZ) and some fraternal (DZ). We expect MZ twins to share all genes and DZ twins to share (on average) half of their genes. As a simple example, if MZ twins have identical scores on a measure and DZ twins have a 50% overlap on that measure, then that measure assesses something that is 100% genetic. With this information, we can compare the relative similarities of MZ and DZ twins and calculate the heritability.

**Personality Assessment:** These studies assessed personality according to the Five Factor Model, which is currently the most popular model of personality (Google scholar shows 2,651 citations of the Costa &amp; McCrae 1992 paper that played a large role in popularizing it). The five factors are Extraversion (Warmth, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity, Excitement Seeking, Positive Emotion), Agreeableness (Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty, Tendermindedness), Neuroticism (Anxiety, Hostility, Depression, Self-consciousness, Impulsiveness, Vulnerability to Stress), Conscientiousness (Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, Deliberation), and Openness (to Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings, Actions, Ideas, Values). This model has been related to everything from social functioning to career success to mental illness, etc.

**Results:** Personality traits are about 50% genetic. Depending on the study they vary from .3 to .6. For example, D, B, L, &amp; K 2008 found Openness to have the highest .58 and Conscientiousness to have the lowest .40. 

**Implications:** We are not tabula rasa, but on average have a large part of our personality genetically determined. Or at least twins do. I also see this as having sort of deterministic implications. In other words, even though we may think we are approaching decisions in as objective and rational a way as possible, there are actually genetic factors that are influencing our behaviors.

Chumly	195	38	70	"I work in a state mental health facility in New England. There is one patient in particular that I spend a lot of time with. I cant go into too much detail because of confidentiality, but one day recently this patient was having a very bad day. His anger issues are very intense, and on this day he had progressed from anger to a confused rage. He had been pounding his hands on the wall, throwing chairs and bellowing, and I had gotten in very close and was talking to him calmly and quietly in an effort to avoid having a help call and a take down and the eventual restraint. 
During this process, as I had a very tight hold on him partly to control him and partly to help anchor him, I watched his face change into an almost completely different version of himself. His physiognomy actually appeared to rearrange itself. His face narrowed considerably and his eyes sunk back. His cheekbones appeared longer and his jawline was much more pronounced. His face remained this way for almost a minute while his hands shook and his breathing became more rapid and shallow. I kept my grip and continued to talk to him, and he gradually relaxed and his face returned to normal.
I know that sometimes people can look very different when they are angry, but this was the first time I had actually been only inches away from someones face and witnessed the change.
Is there a name for this process?

Some additional info - This patient is mildly retarded, but quite aware. He has a good vocabulary, writing skills, and has empathy towards others. He is generous to a fault, and can construct a pretty good joke. He has poor impulse control, and an astonishing rage that scares people. He and I get along very well."	t5_2qhcz	True

1279007838.0	coyk9	"""Reverse anger"" :: a term in Japanese for which we need a pithy English equivalent "	mellowmonk	176	21	87	"*Gyakugire*, which literally means ""reverse anger,"" refers to the phenomenon in which a person who has done something wrong gets angry when rightly confronted with his mistake or transgression -- i.e., using anger to scare off his accusers and shift blame away from himself.

Note that this is not feigned indignation, nor is it angry defiance (""Yeah I did it. So fucking what!""). 

A perfect example: On a document project I was involved with, we ended up printing a couple hundred copies of a non-final, typo-ridden version because the designer sent the wrong file to the printing vendor. 

(He had a habit of saving a new version to his desktop every time a change was made. As a result, his desktop was cluttered with dozens and dozens of version files, most with the auto-assigned filenames as he wouldn't bother to put in a time stamp, etc.)

When confronted, he exploded in anger, saying goddammit, he was sick and tired of this stupid project, and why the hell did we make him work on it? He's not going to put up with this crap any more, etc. etc. No admission of guilt, nor any denial either. 

Anyway, he ranted long and hard, and even ranted to his supervisor that he was sick of it, and being a top designer, he actually got his boss to promise not to make him work on that particular document (produced annually) ever again. And he never did.

So the *gyakugire* strategy worked for him.

Politicians use fake indignation all the time, but this is slightly different. Or is it?

DucoNihilum	199	46	62	"So I noticed a bad trend here, and I wanted to stop it now. I understand not everyone here is going to be fully academic, and that is OK. I do, however, feel that most of the mods here would agree with me that we should introduce new users to psychology to what psychology really is, perhaps without being /too/ dry. 

That being said, we should discuss real psychology here. Not philosophy, not religion, not pseudo scientific ""brain hacks"" that have no verified data, and actually contradict what the field of psychology actually studies. 

Because everyone wants to learn, for right now I am fine with people asking questions. Most self posts hit the spam queue here though, and why is that? Because most people who are making self posts aren't asking about a particular phenomena in psychology, or help with grad school - they want a free therapist. 

Even the therapists among us can't accurately treat any of you with a quick post to reddit besides asking you to see a therapist. There's a very real chance your side of the story isn't accurate (you might have cognitive distortions) and poking and prodding you in public, calling you out on your distortions, or getting as personal as therapy gets (very personal) isn't appropriate here. The only other option would be to allow people to give generally bad advice with little to know background, rapport, analysis, or back and forth - which wouldn't really help you anyways, now would it? 

Go ahead and bring any questions or concerns here, or if you want, message the moderators.

If your posts gets caught in the spam queue and you've read the (new) sidebar and your post actually does belong, please go ahead and message us with a link to the post in question and why you think we should approve it.

I'd never heard of it until recently."	d17c17l	177	39	88	"So, for a couple of years now, I've been battling anxiety and depression and possibly ADHD (the ADHD could be a result of the anxiety and depression, honestly). Recently, I saw a great psychiatrist and she explained to me that, including my mild OCD, I seem to have a thing called obsessive paralysis. What it means, basically, is that I think so much that I can't put my thoughts into actions. Obsession can also lead to a lot of anxiety and depression.

She told me about this sector in the middle area of the brain that deals a lot of serotonin and other funtions, but unfortunately I forget what it was called - I only remember that she said it was composed of three sectors, each with their own function.

What she told me next was interesting: She said that in just about everyone, say more than 90% of people, this area of the brain is not very active at all. But in people like me, she said this area tends to be a perpetual motion machine, a reactor that never cools down, and therefore there are bad mental affects from this area being in overdrive.

She wants to treat it with two low-dose medications: an antidepressant and an anti-psychotic (Prozac and Zyprexa, specifically). Then, after I develop quite the tolerance to these two medications, she wants to put me on an ADHD medication. I have high hopes, because this is not a system of medicating that I have tried. Though I'm not asking for any medical advice here, but opinions are welcome... I came *mainly* to share the knowledge that I currently have about this condition and thought it might be of interest to all of you here at r/psychology.

Here's a link to a pdf article about the condition, though it's not the greatest. I couldn't find the one that my psychiatrist recommended I read.
http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dau/robersts_jan-feb10.pdf

Let me know what you think about this condition or if you know any more about it than I do, I'd be happy to discuss!

Alright, I am sure many of you have seen the Kony video. Regardless of your personal opinion on it, I think most of us can agree that the impact it has made on facebook and around the world is profound. The question is: why was the video so effective? What elements of the video caused such a great movement among the masses?

I think most of us can also agree that the video is very well produced. The editing is clever, the voiceover is motivating, and the message hits home for most of us. To add to the appeal, the director adds his unusually cute child in there even though he has absolutely nothing to do with the cause. What is about this video that makes everyone want to take action, in terms of psychology of course. 

Is it the relative ease of ""liking"" something on fb, combined with the satisfaction one receives when they perceive they are doing something good (dopamine release), AND having a since of belonging with your friends?

This has nothing to do with the content or cause of the video, but the way it was produced and why it was so effective. This is an open discussion, so anything goes.

Hey guys. I'm looking for some genuine, constructive feedback.

I came up with judg.me because I noticed how most of us often wonder not about how ""hot"" we look, but how others *perceive* us. E.g. how differently would you be perceived if you had a faux hawk as opposed to being bald? Do those glasses make you look more ""nerdy""? Does having popped collars really make you look like a douchebag? judg.me lets you find out (and the truth could be painful!).

In the interest of usability, users can be judged on only 2 scales: the social scale (introvert-&gt;extrovert) and the intellectual scale (dense-&gt;smart). Users judge you based on how sociable and intellectual they think you are.

I'm very interested in what you guys think about the 2 scales used. Could it be better represented? Should other scales be used?

I'd appreciate any comments or feedback. Thanks."	t5_2qhcz	True

I constantly hear or read people making ridiculous claims or assertions based on myths, over-simplified explanations, or personal experience. 

Last semester I got into an argument with my roommate and a friends of ours, whom are education/Spanish and religious studies majors, and insisted that manic depression was different from bipolar disorder. They claimed that they both had family members that had been diagnosed in the 90s with manic depression, and would not at all listen when I tried to explain that ""manic depression"" was merely an older, now-obsolete term for what we now call bipolar disorder.

Speaking of disorders, don't even get me started about self-diagnosed disorders. I cringe every time I hear someone say ""I like to have things neat. I'm so OCD!"" As someone that has been diagnosed and re-diagnosed with moderate-level AD/HD and is prescribed Vyvanse, I get legitimately offended every time I hear someone with no education or standing in the field of psychology explain to me that such a disorder does not exist and I'm just lazy. I understand that AD/HD is a controversial subject that has been prone to over-diagnosis and over-prescription of medication, but when someone with no knowledge or understanding of clinical or abnormal psychology speaks as if they're an expert, it really gets to me.

PenguinPerson	141	21	36	"Would you guys be interested if I posted up cases (I will try source real cases) and let you guys try diagnose the mental disorder/disorders in question? I would derive the final answer from the DSM, but encourage people not to use it for their answers as the point is to see if you can figure it out yourselves. I know some of you are more qualified than others to do this, but I think it's a great mental exercise. Plus if you are studying abnormal psychology more cases would probably relate to your interests.

If you post your own case challenges, I can add your links to the case list as well for increased exposure.

Current cases:

Warning some cases may have already been successfully diagnosed. I suggest you avoid the comments thread until you have your own diagnosis.

(x-post from r/sex)	blackberrydoughnuts	146	26	76	"(I posted this on r/sex, and at someone's suggestion I've cross posted to r/psychology and r/asksocialscience. I also cleaned up the language slightly in case this sub wasn't into slang terms.)

I'm curious how much of our turn-ons and desires and attitudes towards sex are social, and how much is innate. I was reading about a man who had never seen a woman in his life:

&gt; Another clue to the monks' attitude to women is provided by the writings of Robert Curzon, an English traveller who visited Athos in the 1840s. On his wanderings around the monasteries, Curzon came across a man who had been left as a foundling on the peninsula, and thereafter been brought up by the monks. This experience meant the man had spent all his life in Athos, and therefore had no idea what women looked like. The only idea of the female body that the man possessed was derived from icons of the Blessed Virgin. Perhaps that is why the man asked Curzon if all women had haloes.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jun/17/gender.uk

&gt; Another experiment with monkeys who were brought up without mothers found them lacking in maternal behavior toward their own offspring. A similar study showed that monkeys brought up without other monkeys of the opposite sex had no interest in mating-all of which suggests that both mothering and mating behavior are learned, not instinctual.

http://jackiewhiting.net/collab/exploratory/motherhood.htm

What kind of effect do you think it would have on a person's sexuality to be isolated from the opposite sex? Would it affect someone's orientation? Would it change how strong their sex drive is?

Would a straight man who had never seen a woman before get erect if he saw a naked woman as an adult?

Would he want to have sex with her?

Would he be turned on by or interested in the sight and smell of her sexual organs?

Would he instinctively know how intercourse worked?

He'd probably figure out that rubbing his sex organs felt good. Would he think about any fantasies while he did so? Would he come up with the idea of a female body without ever seeing one?

Would he be more likely to be attracted to men, or to sexually experiment with them? Would he be more likely to be asexual?

What if he were gay? Would he grow up thinking that everyone was gay? Would he think that was the only way things could be?

And same questions for a woman who had never seen men before.

I know this is all speculative, but I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Even in a verbal assault people seem to have these reactions. So what about the people who tense up and shut down not knowing whether to fight or run for it? What if it's entirely situational? 


An example:


My mother starts attacking me, verbally, for not washing the dishes.  I'm at home, a comfort zone, and I know mother well enough to assess the threat level. I generally and stupidly choose to 'fight'.


Now say I'm out running errands and I accidentally bump another car as I'm trying to park. The owner of the car sees and immediately starts attacking me, again verbally. I'm out in public being shouted at by a stranger. I don't run, nor do I stand my ground. I just stand there silently. I'm going through so many scenarios in my head of what to do and the outcomes of each that my thoughts become too loud to even hear the other person. Eventually I'm able to respond, but it's delayed. 



Any ideas as to why I would just freeze up? Are there any articles that look into the flight or fight response with a third delayed response?

I used to be heavily into viewing gore pictures/video, and I noticed that when I would see something that really affected me (recently, the video of the Chinese girl Yue Yue being run over twice) I would feel detached and slightly depressed for up to several weeks, thinking and ""reliving"" the video in my head.

It got me to wondering if simply viewing images and video online could create at least a mild form of PTSD. I am especially referring to people who have the job of looking at this sort of content (those who filter content for websites, for example) all the time.

I don't mean to downplay anyone who has actually been in combat or in a real-life violent situation, but I feel like there might be something to this. Any case history or evidence?

Although I think there are aspects of psychology that could be strengthened, I also think this is a tremendously important field.  Those 75 million people in the US are suffering a wide range of ailments, and one thing we know is that something (i.e., therapy, counseling, etc.) is better than nothing. So, if you're passionate about working the field, go for it (doesn't matter if it's as a MSW, MA in counseling, PhD in counseling/psychology, or PsyD).

It sounds like the in-group out-group pressure that people exert, but in my own life I have observed it on more individual levels.

For example, when a friend of mine was getting into Islam, I constantly felt the need to point out the things he was doing or how it was inconsistent with his past views (quitting alcohol and pork, praying).  I realized it was uncalled for, and I was being a jerk, but it was hard to stop.   Also, I see this all the time with ex-lovers, when they say ""you never used to..."" or ""so now you're just _____ all of a sudden"".

I could think of a few explanations for this behavior.  One being that people have certain roles and each other's lives, and once they are established, it is difficult to deal with those roles changing.  Or, it could be a resistance to a change in some sort of social hierarchy.

They may talk about how happy they are and even how nice your actions were, but never will you hear ""thank you"".

Same thing with ""sorry"". Some people, regardless of how serious the error, will not say ""sorry"". I'm sure they ARE apologetic, but they can't bring themselves to utter the word. Instead, they will often switch blame or try to claim the issue isn't as grave.

My best guess is that this is a self-esteem issue. Pride. Their self-image is too fragile to admit weakness.

And it's sad, because you can almost feel like they WANT to say those words. I'm sure they have difficulty with other words too. Please, I love you, etc.

What do the psychologists think?

EDIT: Some really great answers.  I did want to clarify one thing as some people are confused about my use of the word ""misfire"" and think that it means that I'm speaking negatively about it.  

A ""misfire"" is simply a term used to denote an action derived from trait that it wasn't originally selected for. I.e. our ancestors never knew what reddit is, but they had social hierarchies. A positioning instinct within social hierarchies of the past translated to an instinct today to collect ""karma"" would be a ""misfiring"".

Human fascination with sports would be another example of an evolutionary misfiring as it plays out tribal warring instincts. That doesn't mean sports are ""bad"", it's just a misfire."	t5_2qhcz	True

The reason I'm asking though, is from a personal point of view.

Here's the story.

I tried to break up with my last girlfriend 3 or 4 times. Meaning, I actually said ""I think we should break up."" Through lengthy discussions, she agreed to do things differently and we stayed together. So basically, it was a ridiculously conflicted relationship. Lots and lots conflict, and misunderstandings, and tons of communication, and figuring each other out. She hurt my feelings more than anyone ever in my life... it was always unintentional... but still.

We broke up last Christmas, because she can't live on PEI yet (she's from Montreal)... and its the only place I want to be.

Fast forward to now. I have a beautiful, caring, funny, amazing girlfriend, and we've been together since March. And yet, I spend at least a little time each day, thinking about my ex, checking to see if she's updated her profile pic on facebook, wondering how she's doing... missing her basically.

It sucks. I feel like I'm cheating on my current girlfriend. Obviously, I'm not... but it feels that way a bit.

SO - ""Why do people keep going back to people that made them miserable?""

1338165160.0	u7yzi	I've had a number of girlfriends threaten suicide and I have a question.	suicide_question	135	36	150	"Throwaway. Hi. Ive actually had a number of girlfriends threaten to kill themselves. Those that did came from abusive parent relationships, they'd been sexually abused in their childhood. I responded with extreme urgency and as much care as I could each time. And was duly manipulated. They turned out to be false threats. I treated them like they were real threats. 

Now I have a number of people telling me that people who actually do commit suicide don't advertise it or threaten it. As a result of that I'm not sure how to feel. Am I a fool or did I do the right thing? (The right thing has varied from being completely manipulated the first relationship where that happened, to immediately seeking professional help for the next one where it happened.)

It created an extreme amount of anxiety in me each time it did happen and ended up destroying the relationship. First time it happened I became a martyr, and that blew up in my face as my partner had been diagnosed as a borderliner [I didnt know what that meant at the time but I do now] and used it as continuous leverage.

The next time it happened (two relationships later, different woman) I immediately brought her in for professional help. I refused to be manipulated but I tried to help. The threat destroyed our relationship. I felt blackmailed. 

Now family &amp; friends tell me open suicide threats are not valid. I'm not sure what to think of myself as a result, i was operating on the idea of hopefully erring on the side of caution. Am I a fool or did I do the right thing? Is what friends and family are telling me even true?

Dear All, thank you very much for your responses... this whole post has served an important purpose.. it broke me out of the depression I was in and opened my mind. Thanks alot for your participation! We all chewed the shit really well and thanks. As far as the statement my friends and family made regarding the issue, well, an old quote is creeping into a little corner of my mind and wont go away... little too strongly worded for my case, but it approaches the truth a little:

So I'm a psych major in college and I really like these kinds of things. I've noticed in a lot of things (notably music, sports, politics, news... list goes on and on) that people have this unbreakable notion that the past is somehow a priori better. People will say things like, ""there will never be another musician like ____"" or ""there will never be another *insert basketball/baseball/hockey player*"" (e.g babe ruth, etc) or ""politics used to be so fair and honorable, we'll never get that golden age back."" It seems like somehow people have this notion that because something happened in the past it is unreachable in the present. 

It's almost like a strong feeling of nostalgia, but what's crazy is that it effects people who weren't even alive in the period they are referencing.  I think a good example of this is that recently a lot of ad campaigns have been focusing on presenting, say, an alcoholic drink, at an old-time party where the ad might start off black and white and then go color but it's clear that the party being presented is from like 1930... because somehow parties from the olden days are just ""better"", more ""manly"" or whatever the right word is.

Are there any articles you guys can recommend on this phenomenon, or any studies confirming/rejecting my observation?"	t5_2qhcz	True

It was a very unique feeling which both scared me and fascinated me at the same time. Basically what happened was that I woke up in the middle of the night, but was completely unable to move any muscles or make any noise. My girlfriend, who was lying next to me, was breathing, and slowly the sound of her breathing morphed into something else. The sound was sort of alienlike with a lot of reverb, echoing in our bedroom. At first I was a bit afraid, seeing that I've never experienced anything similar, but at the same time I was very aware of what was happening (I've read about it before). This calmed me down and when I after about 30 seconds got out of the state, I managed to get back into it and repeated the course of events perhaps two more times before I was fully awake and conscious. It's very hard to describe the feeling. It scared me but was at the same time very tempting.

After a little light googling I found that, since parts of my brain was still sleeping, I was awake while dreaming. Hence the hypnopompic audiohallucination (which was basically a dream) and the paralysis (seeing that you are in almost all cases unable to move during REM-sleep).

I've heard stories of other people being completely horrified by this phenomena, but to me it was more of an amazing experience. I am very curious to know if you have anything similar to share, what are your impressions/opinions/experiences of sleep paralysis?

**TL;DR Last night I experienced muscular paralysis and hallucination, what similar experiences have you had?**
