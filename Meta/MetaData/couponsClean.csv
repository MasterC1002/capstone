1366723933.0	1cxmtf	Print while you can! 50 cent flip flops and free mens t-shirts at Target.	TheKrystalShip	113	29	32	"There are some awesome coupons on Target's website right now, that will likely be taken down and changed shortly. There is a $2 off any flip flop or flat sandal coupon, and Target sells it's flip flops for $2.50. There are also some great deals in clearance right now.

Also, there is a $3 off one mens Champion t-shirt coupon. These are usually marked around $7.99, but a lot of them went on clearance. The ones that I personally saw were at $2.98 and $3.98, making some of them as low as free. There is also a coupon for $3 off one womens Champion t-shirt, regularly $9.99 on sale this week for $6 making them only $3 after the coupon. 

Print these while you can, because Target store coupons are often short lived.

Edit: I do not agree in photocopying and reposting an imgur link to a coupon AT ALL. Regardless of what any of you say, this is NOT legal. At the very least, it's not something that's condoned by Target. Do what you will but please don't do it on this thread.

1360703946.0	18ef3h	Making Money with Extrabucks Deals &amp; Coupons at CVS	jainagirl	71	15	19	"I also posted this to /frugal but I know couponers can appreciate this as well. This is one way I am frugal with my money. I basically use ""monopoly money"" at CVS in the form of Extrabucks and rarely pay out of pocket for anything. Each week I buy items using coupons and Extrabucks and keep getting Extrabucks back. I always find things I can USE to turn my Extrabucks around with. Vitamins, deodorants, lotion, food, etc always have Extrabucks deals depending on the weekly sale. In November I got free headphones and a tv remote. In December I got free socks. 

**Example 1:** A few weeks ago Nivea lotion was part of an Extrabucks deal where you buy any 2 Nivea lotions, get back $6. Well, the blue lotion tins on sale for .99 cents were part of this deal. Buy 2 Nivea tins, pay $1.98, get back $6 in Extrabucks. I did this deal twice so I received a $12 Extrabucks reward after paying $3.96 for lotion = $8 profit. http://imgur.com/JtD2evv

**Example 2:** Today I made $5 in CVS bucks by picking up 2 Conair curling irons on sale this week! They are normally $10 each and my store had them displayed as 50% off making them $4.99 AND you could combine that deal with getting back $5 in extra bucks. (Normally clearance items don't allow you extrabucks back but this one does.) This essential made them free, you pay tax only. http://imgur.com/VAKmTMM

HOWEVER, they are ringing up at my local store as 2.49 (75% off). The limit for getting extrabucks back is 2 for this deal (always reference the sale tag). That means I bought 2 Conair curling irons, paid $2.49 each for them and got back $10 = $5 profit to spend on whatever I want. http://imgur.com/n43bCLP

**Example 3 (for /coupons only):** Many times I find deals on toothpaste for example where if you buy a $3 tube of Colgate Toothpaste you will get $2 in Extrabucks back. Don't be afraid to use a coupon with this! $1 off Colgate toothpaste coupon plus the $2 you get in Extrabucks makes it FREE! :)

Safeway and Walgreens in my area (Northern California) will not take coupons that exceed the value of the item.  Case in point, I tried to buy a package of soap along with some other items that I was not using coupons for. Soap was priced at $0.99 and I had a $1 off coupon. Safeway and Walgreens would not take the $1 off coupon because it was one penny over the cost of the soap.  I pointed out that cashiers have the ability to adjust down the value of the coupon to $0.99. They won't (or don't know how to) do it and act like I am crazy for suggesting it.  Furthermore, they act like I am trying the cheat the store by using coupons.  I let them know its their corporate coupon policy to mark down the coupon value. It doesn't matter; they won't do it.  A few times the manager has come over and wouldn't do it either.

Interestingly, I tried the deal at Lucky Supermarket where the item was on sale for $0.96.  The cash register computer took the coupon and automatically adjusted the value down to $0.96.

Has anyone successfully had a cashier manually adjust a coupon value down? What are your tips for success? Cashiers are not friendly in my area and generally do not help customers. Does having a print out of the coupon policy actually help or do the cashiers become more aggressive?"	t5_2qt5n	True

Purchase 6 Pagoda Express Entrees. They are frozen, and with the other oriental microwaveable meals. 
Use 6 .75 cent coupons, found [here](http://www.coupons.com/couponweb/Offers.aspx?pid=13903&amp;zid=xh20&amp;nid=10&amp;cid=17794169). Stop &amp; Shop's policy is to only double 4 like coupons, but they doubled all 6 of mine when I just went yesterday. 

So your total is 6 entrees X $2 each = $12 - $9 (if all 6 of your coupons double like mine did) - $5 instant savings. Making your final total a $2 credit!

The reason for this is there has been an increase in the number of 0-day account posts, and they've all been spam. If you made a new account to post a great coupon you found you have two options:

* [PM us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23coupons&amp;subject=New%20account%20wanting%20to%20post). Include the link you want to post in the message and we will make a determination (it'll probably be fine, spammers generally don't contact the guys in charge), or
* wait a while, do some redditing, get some time and karma under your belt so we can see that you're here to stay.

As I waited in the other line the store manager approached me and told me I was only allowed to get one bottle. I told her I would use cash for one transaction and my credit card for the next ( Mind you I wasn't paying anything at all for it). She gave me an attitude and I noticed all the cashiers were extremely rude and rolled their eyes as my total came out to $0.00. Everything was legit. Not to mention the security guard followed me around the store the second time I came in. I was not doing anything illegal I just took advantage of the coupons that were on the actually Target website,  but it really bothered me on how they treated me. I felt like they viewed me as a theif.  What do you suggest I do next time, find another Target? I just want to know if any of you savers have experienced this?	t5_2qt5n	True

I live in Bellevue, WA if that matters, I know a lot of the coupons are region specific. And my household is just my boyfriend and I, so we don't need any baby coupons or anything like that...(although I have to admit I can't believe some of the deals on diapers!)

1321849245.0	mjrrp	Update: First coupon shopping trip: Not a complete disaster..  FU Walmart.	alwyne	27	10	18	"[Original link here, asking for tips on how to begin!](http://www.reddit.com/r/coupons/comments/m36j6/wondering_how_to_begin/)

Soo..  I ended up going to Wal-mart with a pile of competitor store ads and several manu. coupons.  I had my shopping list in hand that included:

* Item name
* Maximum size of item I could get (oz? etc)
* Price matched amount with competitor ad
* Any coupons that would also be applied
* Total price to be paid.

I was pumped about making this trip something to remember, because I'd pre-planned so much and this was one of my first major shopping trips.  I was going to save about 50% of my bill (not bad for a first timer!).

I grabbed my items and made my way to the checkout (about an hour long process as everyone and their dog was in the store!).  Upon reaching the cashier, I tell him that I am going to be price-matching my items and asked him to kindly go slowly because I wanted to make sure -I- didn't do something wrong.  The cashier gives me a strange look, says it will be a fun transaction, and asks me for my ads!...

Wha?  I'm a new couponer and am well-versed in Wal-mart coupon-fu as I've just studied it!  I give him a strange look and say, ""Your policy doesn't require the ads..""  He chuckles and says that they do, in fact, need the ads.

Ugh.  I brought the ads for -my- benefit (to double check myself) not for his -- What would have happened had I not brought the ads?  Was he only asking to ""look"" at them because I had them handy and he wanted to make my life miserable?....

I turned a slight shade of red and told him I didn't want to go through the hassle of finding every single item (again) in my ads simply for HIM and proceeded to repack up my items and go to a different cashier.

Second cashier didn't even give me two looks about the items (well, for one she did.. apparently, it was a really slick deal on Oreos (1.66 for a big pack of double stuffs!) and she requested to see my ad for that price.  Since it was about a 2$ difference on price, I can see where she was concerned I was ""screwing"" her..  I showed off the ad (3/5) and off we went!)  

In total, I saved a bunch of monies..  felt exhilarated by the process, and am happy it is over.  I am glad I didn't dump my groceries with the first cashier and walk out of the store when he demanded my ads.. I would have missed out on all of my deals!  On that note, I didn't realize that the deals at some stores (CVS, Walgreens, local grocery stores) were so amazing and that their prices could be -so much lower- than Wal-marts.  Granted, I got a lot of name-brand products for cheaper than dirt.. and the manufacturer Q's helped a ton!

I don't know if I'll price match at WM again -- I don't want to end up with a cashier like numero 1 again.

Anyone else have fun ""first timer"" stories? :)

1368055847.0	1dyros	Any Physicians Formula fans out there? Great deal at CVS this week. No coupons needed (but they'll make it even better).	thingsthingsthings	22	5	5	"If you have a CVS card, all PF stuff is $6 off. This includes coverup sticks (light, yellow, and green). Makes them $.49 to $.79 cents apiece.

The mineral powder is normally $14 or so at my store, but you can snag it for $8 this week.

You don't need any coupons -- if you have a store card, the $6 comes off automatically at the register. To sweeten the deal, if you scan your card at the Big Red Machine (the machine that spits out coupons), some people are getting coupons good for $7 off any PF purchase or $3 off any PF purchase.

All of this is good through Saturday. I picked up 7 concealers, some liquid liner (just to try), a nice eyeshadow palette for hazel eyes, and something else (is it bad that I can't remember?!)

Anyway, I hope some of you find this post useful. Also, if you really want to go nuts, there's a manufacturer's coupon for $1 off any PF product in many 4/28 coupon circulars (if you still have your Sunday paper from that date).

And, don't forget -- if you DO get a coupon from the Big Red Machine, you can stack it with the $1/1 coupon from the 4/28 sunday circular (I think it was RP, but I'm not sure). This will give you even more savings.

Happy shopping!

You can't get the points if you buy Stop and Shop gift cards, only cards to other stores. OR generic MAsterCard/Visa dgift cards.

 In theory, I think I can go in the store, buy $150 dollars in MasterCard to get 300 gas points. And then use the Mastercard to buy my food later, which will give me more points.

I personally am on a Ketogenic diet, so there's only part of my food supply that can be saved on with coupons, but things like butter/oil/cheese can be found I guess.

But she is not on my diet, so good deals on just about ANYTHING could be worth it.

Plus deals on cleaning supplies etc would of course be useful.

I guess what I'm looking for is a site that is the ""Idiots guide to saving money via coupons"".  We showed up at our grocery store today and they had a flier that we found some good deals in, including a promotion where you buy a bulk package of chicken breasts (something we would buy anyway) and we got: Can of cream of chicken soup, 2L of diet root beer, 1lbs box of rice, take and bake cookies, shredded cheese, bag of frozen green beans, and a aluminum baking pan free.

That was a lot of fun, kind of like a treasure hunt.  After that experience I realize that we need to come up with a system...and there has GOT to be a community of people that discuss these systems...ANY advice, links etc would be GREATLY appreciated.

(BTW the store was a Tops grocery store if you'd like to have the same fun treasure hunt.)"	t5_2qt5n	True

(My wife is new to this and thought I would try and help.)		14	3	11	"I have already been insanely impressed with what my wife has gotten for free/nearly free. We are subscribed to the the daily paper in my area (which provides her with one set of red plum, smart something or other and P&amp;G... forgive me for my little knowledge).

Today she got a bunch of stuff because she had a 4 dollar off razors coupon, which she found some for 2 bucks and where buy one get one free. So she was able to buy 6 bucks worth of stuff due to her having two coupons. I asked her why she didn't do 4 (believe that was the max for the store) and she said it was due to her not having that many coupons.

She told me she can get double coupon sunday papers at kroger for 3 bucks. I know we have made more than 3 bucks from savings already... but is there an easier way to get 2/3/4 sets of the weekly coupon books without purchasing entire newspapers? I feel wierd buying a paper and throwing 95% of the paper away for 2/3 little coupon books inside.

Also sorry if this is frowned upon. I read through the description here and also through both ""read this""/""read more here"" sections and didn't see anything about just asking questions.

**TL:DR: Wife started couponing trying to find best way to help get 3 or 4 of the coupon books without begging neighbors/etc.**"	t5_2qt5n	True

Yesterday (I'm a mini extreme couponer) I scored about 19 boxes of cereal, some for as low as .80 a box!  Thanks to the fact that they double coupons up to $1.  But you can only use one type of coupon per family member per day.

It's my senior year in high school and I'm trying to end it with a bang of sorts... through Men's Wearhouse, I am trying to earn $25,000 for my school, $25,000 to put towards college, and some apple gear to use in school and for the various music and video production I do.

I've applied to the likes of Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, USC, and Northwestern -- none of which are cheap -- and it appears as though my prospects of attending one of these may succumb to their price tags...

I've become a prom rep for Men's Wearhouse with the hopes of alleviating these financial concerns and the stress of debt. To win, I must refer the most amount of people to use the following code in renting a tux, saving them $40 and helping me achieve my goal. 

3879325

Saving the cash is as simple as providing the code -- thats all. Last year's winner apparently got 3,000 individuals to use their code... I think i can do better; my goal is 4,000. To all that can help.. please do, and save yourself (and your friends) some cash.

EDIT 1: Thank you to consideracynic, I just remembered: this code can be used for ALL rentals, not just those for prom.  Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, Quinceneras, whatever the hell you can think of -- everyone saves $40.  Deal ends June 30th."	t5_2qt5n	True

As I've been searching store mail-outs for deals, I've finally come across something.

CVS has Gillette Venus razors on sale for $8.99 w/ card and $4.00 extrabucks (essentially making them $4.99). Although this is a fantastic deal, I see that there is a MFR coupon out to take another $2.00 off, making them $2.99! However, this coupon is nowhere to be found in my local Sunday Paper's coupons...

At pretty much all Speedway gas station if you get a FUEL card and put either the amount you want or sometimes up to $50?, which I think gives you bonus points, and use it at the card slot thing outside at the pump it will automatically lower it -$0.03. At SOME speedways if you use your rewards card (not the credit card, that'd save more) it will either notice its you for points or also take off another 0.03 for a total savings of $0.06. If you sign up for their debit at pump to your card thing I think it does this too, but worse case use the fuel pump card and you at LEAST save 0.03	t5_2qt5n	True

I had thought my order went through, and when I went to go track my order, there was no order there and went to their website, and saw that the items were still in the cart! I was sure that I had clicked on ""order"" and thought everything had gone through, but I guess it didn't.

Anyway, my point is, I was buying stuff that I really needed, and now the 25% discount no longer stands. I have an AE store in my town, however, the stuff that I needed was actually through their other site, Aerie, and my store does not carry Aerie, and the actual Aerie store here closed a few months ago. I know that some people get sent discounts in varying amounts, anywhere from 15-40% off. I have a 15% off coupon, but would prefer it to be more, if possible because obviously, it would be nice to get as good a deal as I thought I was getting when I thought the order went through. I searched online and found no better than a 15% code-would anyone happen to have a higher discount code that they either a) know of or b) have, but aren't planning on using and could PM to me?

TL;DR Anyone have an AE/Aerie coupon code that's more than 15% off that they aren't going to use?

The last guy profiled on the show bought 1100 boxes of Total cereal, for almost free. The retail value of the cereal was around $4,000. He then donated all of the cereal to a local food bank. My question for the frugal reddit community is... Would this man be able to claim the retail value of that donation as a charitable tax write off for his federal income taxes? Or would he only be able to claim the amount of money that he spent on the cereal?

1316832528.0	kpps9	Anyone in the Sarasota, Florida area? I have amazing coupons to give you for free! 	Lolleh	12	9	1	"I have 5 ""Enjoy the city"" coupon books that have coupons restricted to the Sarasota, Florida area. I got these books during a really awesome sale and they had really amazing Winn-Dixie coupons that are not area restricted. So now I'm left with really amazing coupons that I can't use! (I live in Palm Beach county)

Here's a preview of the book: http://issuu.com/enjoythecityinc./docs/sarasota_bradenton_fall_11?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Fcolor%2Flayout.xml&amp;backgroundColor=000000&amp;showFlipBtn=true

You'll get all of the coupons EXCEPT the Winn-Dixie coupons (I only ordered the books for the Winn-Dixie coupons). I'm just asking for you to pay for Shipping, which is $5 flat rate (I'm a poor college student who started couponing to save money). 

I'm really jealous I can't use these coupons and I hope some lucky Reddiors in Sarasota can use these. Most of these coupons are for free stuff!!"	t5_2qt5n	True
