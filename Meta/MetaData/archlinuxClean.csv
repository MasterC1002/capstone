Svenstaro	157	19	67	"Arch now has more users than ever before but our numbers of package maintainers didn't increase that much. Lately, a few TUs (trusted users) have gone inactive without notice. 

A TU's duty is to keep [community] updated and to moderate AUR. We do not handle [core] or [extra], that is for the developers to do (but packages can be moved among all official repos if required).

Currently, [these](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Trusted_Users) are the people maintaining all of [community], nearly 4000 packages.

Sadly, we also have around [150 orphans](http://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&amp;repo=Community&amp;q=&amp;maintainer=orphan&amp;last_update=&amp;flagged=&amp;limit=50) in [community] and around [700 orphans](http://www.archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&amp;repo=Community&amp;repo=Community-Testing&amp;repo=Core&amp;repo=Extra&amp;repo=Multilib&amp;repo=Multilib-Testing&amp;repo=Testing&amp;q=&amp;maintainer=orphan&amp;last_update=&amp;flagged=&amp;limit=50) in total.

It would be cool to have some more people helping out here. To put our efforts into perspective, in Arch the average maintainer has around 100 packages to take care of. In Debian, which has thousands of developers, each package usually has a whole team of people caring for it.

To become TU, you should read the [TU bylaws](https://aur.archlinux.org/trusted-user/TUbylaws.html). You are required to find a sponsor (another TU) and to write an application to the aur-general mailing list. The requirements for a TU in a nutshell:

* don't be a dick
* understand and embrace the Arch way
* at least basic scripting experience
* maintain a few packages in AUR with good, clean PKGBUILDs
* ~~like ponies~~

I've been an on-off Linux user for about 15 years now, after starting with Slackware, which I struggled with - eventually causing me to give up and go back to using Windows for a few years. 

For the past couple of years I've been dual booting Ubuntu and Windows. I've also tried Debian.
Ubuntu is a great distro, loved how easy it was to set up, and was overawed by apt (back in my Slackware days I was compiling everything from source, trying to resolve dependencies on my own using software magazine cover CDs!). However, it feels so bloated, and any problems I had were fixed by trawling forums and copying commands verbatim, I had very little clue as to how the system worked.
Whilst waiting ages for Windows to shut down after accidentally booting into it (I realised this was the only reason I ever booted Windows) and then booting into Ubuntu (which whilst faster still feels pretty slow) I remembered my Slackware days where I could be at a command prompt within a minute, and that was on a Pentium 2.

I briefly considered trying Slackware again, but my memories of hunting for software on CDs, typing ./configure and then being confused for hours put me off.

After a but of research I discovered Arch. It sounded like the distro I've been looking for, so in a rash decision, I backed up my files, booted gparted and partitioned my drive ready for my glorious single boot Arch.

The learning started there, in those few minutes I learned more about the benefits of splitting the file system across different partitions, and using different file systems than in the past 15 years.

The installation itself was pretty straightforward when following the Beginners Guide, and again, it was educational. I could see what Daemons were going to run, I understood what each of them did. I learned about backgrounding Daemons, learned so much.

After the install I realised that I was going to have to spend some time getting my Broadcom wireless working (had to do this in Debian and older Ubuntu releases), and whilst it took a few more steps under Arch I found that I understood my system, understood why this particular wireless chipset was a bit of a pain.
Now, after about 4 hours I have an great setup that boots me into an Xfce desktop with very little else other than my web browser and Eclipse, no Solitaire games, no post it note applets, not even a display manager. I ran the top command and almost wet myself. 

I'm sure you get posts like this all the time from excited new users, but I just wanted to share my story!

1366717984.0	1cxhqj	Multiseat Gaming Guide	dardyfella	98	12	16	"Late one night I had an idea to run a gaming-capable multiseat setup. Ever since then I've been looking around for a solution and I found three possible solutions:

* https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=105450
* https://github.com/fenghaitao/xserver-with-gl-accelerated-xephyr
* Multiseat with 2 or more graphics cards

I was unsatisfied with the hackish nature of using multiple X pointers and I was unable to get it working properly anyway whilst the OpenGL accelerated Xephyr fork was 3 years old and buying a second graphics card was out of the question. I was about to give up until I stumbled across another possible solution - Xephyr with VirtualGL.

For those new to multiseating, multiseating is the practice of having multiple users simultaneously using one PC with separate inputs per user (and potentially separate monitors per user). Xephyr, a nestable X server, spawns a child X server within a parent X server. You can attach a physical keyboard and mouse to it and those inputs will be locked to the Xephyr X server. Xephyr is your standard solution when it comes to multiseating - it's been around for a while. Xephyr however doesn't support hardware-accelerated OpenGL much to my dismay.

Enter VirtualGL.

In short, VirtualGL allows you to forward OpenGL calls to a remote server (in this case, we'll be using localhost). This allows you to bypass the fact that Xephyr doesn't support hardware-accelerated OpenGL. The possibilities are endless - a split-screen Steam console is one possibility. Bringing one PC and multiple monitors/keyboard/mice to a LAN party is another.

I've tested it with both native Quake 3 (ioquake3-git - ioquake3 wouldn't compile properly for me) and Warcraft 3 launched with WINE. The framerates seem ok and there aren't any input issues as long as you tie physical keyboards/mice to the Xephyr X servers. Scrots are below:

http://imgur.com/He05tHz,YWxKLgV,7RsEYm0,VTcv62I

Enough of my yapping - here's the guide to setting this up.


NOTE: Chances are you will need a beefy PC for this to work. Here are the specs of the PC I used to test the games: 

* Intel Core i7-3820
* ASUS P9X79
* 1 x AMD 7970
* 32GB of RAM
* 1 x SSD
* 1 x Monitor

NOTE: I'm going to assume you are running Arch Linux and you know what X is and how to install packages and install from PKGBUILDs. All packages listed here (with the exception of TurboVNC and AMD Catalyst drivers) are available from the Arch Linux repositories. I'm not going to go into detail with setting up WINE for Warcraft 3 because the information is already out there.

NOTE: You'll need N+1 keyboards and N+1 mice where N is the number of seats. The extra one keyboard and mouse is for managing the primary X server so you can start Xephyr servers and launch X applications. You can follow this guide if you only have one monitor - it'll just get a little cramped.

Step 1:Install a graphics driver if you don't have one installed already. NVIDIA users - I don't know what the best driver is for 3D performance but I'm going to guess it'll be the proprietary one. AMD users - install either catalyst-total if you've got a card older than the 7xxx series or install catalyst-test if you have one of the newer 7xxx series cards. Intel users - I have no idea if this will even be worth the time for you but you can always give it a go. 7xxx users may also have to downgrade their xf86-input-evdev and xorg-server packages to accommodate catalyst-test.

Step 2: Setup your X config (I used aticonfig --initial to generate my xorg.conf - I don't know what you NVIDIA users do). It doesn't need to be too fancy just as long as X uses our graphics driver we installed from step 1. Install mesa-demos and run glxgears or launch a 3D game to be sure that your X server has hardware acceleration.

Step 3: Install the following packages:
If you have a 32-bit Arch Linux installation:

    pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr virtualgl

If you have a 64-bit Arch Linux installation:

    pacman -S xorg-server-xephyr virtualgl lib32-virtualgl

Step 4: Run 'vglserver_config' as root. Follow the answers.

    Press 1 to Configure server for use with VirtualGL
    Answer 'Yes' to Restrict 3D X server access to vglusers group (recommended)?
    Answer 'Yes' to Restrict framebuffer device access to vglusers group (recommended)?
    Answer 'Yes' to Disable XTEST extension (recommended)?
    Press X to Exit.

Step 5: Add the user you log into X with into the vglusers group.

    usermod -aG vglusers USERNAME

Step 6: Logout, restart X and log back in to X.

Step 7: Launch N+1 terminals.

Step 8: Now launch Xephyr N times, once per terminal, incrementing the display number and changing the keyboard and mouse inputs each time you run the command. For example - we want to run two Xephyr servers or seats because we have two extra mice and two extra keyboards. So we'd run the following commands in two separate terminals:

    sudo Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1024x768 :1 -mouse evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-MOUSE-1 -keybd evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-KEYBOARD-1

    sudo Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1024x768 :2 -mouse evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-MOUSE-2 -keybd evdev,,,device=/dev/input/by-id/USB-KEYBOARD-2

You'll want to select the USB mouse devices that have 'event-mouse' at the end of the device id.

Running the commands with sudo is necessary because we need to rights to gain access to the USB devices however we still need rights to launch X-based programs within our primary or parent X server. We must also increment the display option or display identifier (:1, :2, :3 and so on) so we have some way of distinguishing between the X servers. Our primary X server that we first log into is almost always display identifier 0 or :0


After running these two commands you should see two black windows appear. You won't be able to use the keyboard and mouse just yet - we've got to launch an X application within our Xephyr servers.

Step 9: Paste the following text into our spare terminal and press enter:

    DISPLAY="":1""

Doing this modifies the display variable which allows us to launch a X application underneath a different X server - in this case one of our Xephyr servers. To launch X applications in another Xephyr session, change the number in the above variable. To return to launching X applications in our primary X server, change the number to 0.

Step 10: Launch an X application within our spare terminal.
You can launch just about anything here - a window manager, a terminal emulator. You should see the result in one of the Xephyr servers and you should be able to use the keyboard and mouse you've assigned to the Xephyr server. If you want to run an X application as a different user within the Xephyr server you must prefix it with sudo -u USERNAME X_APPLICATION. I had to do this to get Frozen Throne running in my second Xephyr server because it complained about Frozen Throne already running in the first Xephyr server. Keep in mind also that the user must be a part of the vglusers group if you decide to use different users underneath each Xephyr server.

Step 11: Launch a 3D application.
You can either do this step from inside the Xephyr server or from our spare terminal in our primary X server. To do so you must prefix the command for the 3D application with 'vglrun'. For example:

    vglrun glxgears

    vglrun quake3

    vglrun wine Frozen\ Throne.exe

Step 12: Congratulations or it didn't work and OP sucks.
It either worked for you or it didn't. If it didn't work for you try something simple like vglrun glxgears inside your primary X server and then inside one of the Xephyr servers and see if that works and then move up to a native 3D game like Quake 3 and if you really get stuck you should make a post and I'll try and guide you through it. Finally: a funny fact about this guide: I had more trouble installing Arch Linux with a UEFI boot loader than I did getting gaming-capable multiseat working.

The next update to this guide (if I don't lose my mind trying to understand the black magic that is Sound on Linux) will be sorting out sound and have sound from each Xephyr server come out on separate audio jacks on one audio device/card (if such a thing is even possible) or separate audio devices/cards (much more plausible). Exploring TurboVNC and the possibilities it brings is also something I want to do."	t5_2qrzu	True

1325981293.0	o7b2v	Thank you Arch!	delboy83uk	99	19	37	"I've been a linux user for about 4 years now, my distribution of choice has always been ubuntu. The reason being it was the easy to install and it all just worked. I was by no means a linux guru and very rarely used the terminal, often using it to just copy and paste commands into or apt-get a program. 

Now my PC is a now ageing Vaio laptop and the switch to Unity made my laptop run extremely slow. That combined with the fact that I really didn't like it meant I was going to have to abandon my distro of choice.  

I made the switch to Mint as it still used ubuntu and had kept gnome 2. All was well until Mint 12 and the dawn of gnome 3, again my laptop was chugging.

So ANOTHER distro was needed, after much searching I settled on crunchbang. It's a very nice distro it ran quickly and was IMO very slick looking. 

After the shock of no restricted drivers installer, it was my daily runner for about 2 weeks. I came to love openbox, it's amazing. I did have a major issue though, the stable build of debian is now getting rather long in the tooth, there was a coupe of programs that I simply couldn't install as there were too many out of date dependencies.

So I went looking for yet another distribution, I'd seen alot of people mention Arch. It was a rolling release so always upto date and had this fancy thing called the AUR. and when I saw there was an Archbang version the switch was made. This again was used for about 2 week's I had a very strange issue with the laptop resetting instead of powering down and another couple of niggles. These were enough for me to take the plunge.

I was going to so a fresh install of Arch from scratch. This may be trivial to some people but to me it seemed like climbing a mountain. I'd have to set up EVERYTHING. 

Well that was four days ago, i now have a fully working system,  all niggles ironed out. No rebooting, brightness finally works! (This was the one thing that confused me the most the wiki was actually more confusing than helpful on this.)

I can honestly say I've learnt more in the last four days setting up my arch install than using ubuntu for four years. I' not detracting from Ubuntu here for an absolute begginer who just wants their computer to work with no fuss it's still great. 

I have a new found confidence in using my linux system, I'm still googling and reading lot's but I feel like a powerhouse of linux knowledge compared to five days ago.

I'll stop rambling now and just say,

Thanks to all who contribute to the arch wiki, the people in the forum and IRC and the people who maintain the AUR. You guys are awesome and I wouldn't have this amazing software on my PC without you.

TL;DR Noob installs Arch, loves it, wants to say thanks :)

A large part of the systemd thing is that making an init system is a lot of work.  Eight years ago Arch only had 15 volunteers.  Now we have 60, but there are probably a hundred times more end users [ed: *than there were 8 years ago, silly rickisen*].  People trying to run full disk encryption across multiple LVM volumes with a squashfs /usr or other such fancy setups that are a whole lot of work to support.  If RedHat wants to do the dirty work, we will probably let them.

But here is the thing - a big part of Arch is that everything should be supported and switching subsystems should be easy.  Look at switching logins, shells, window managers.  Look at how easy it is to switch between OSSv4, ALSA and Pulse.

If someone maintains it, it will exist in Arch.  If you really want Arch to use SystemFoo, step up and maintain it.  Make your own fork on AUR, get other people using it, become a TU, make it an official package.  If a dev really likes your work, you might be able to skip those last few steps.

I started using Arch because it was an almost pure meritocracy.  It takes remarkably little to become part of the distribution, particularly compared to becoming a Debian packager.  Arch is receptive to flexibility and there is always room for more options."	t5_2qrzu	True

1368193030.0	1e2fv1	Just installed arch linux yesterday - WOW!	ponchedeburro	105	30	39	"So I just installed arch linux yesterday.

My linux history so far started with mandrake back in 2003, where after I tried using Gentoo for a few months in 2005 and then with Ubuntu 6.06 I started my long use of Ubuntu. I recently jumped to Debian a year ago. I must say that Ubuntu and Debian really does a lot for you during installation and every-day use. 

Even though I have been using linux for nearly a decade now I feel like I learned a lot just by installing arch linux and customizing my awesome (the wm) setup. I haven't gotten my wireless to work just yet which is what I'm gonna have fun with tonight. Even though it is a little work and I would have no idea how to do it without a guide or such, I am actually looking forward to learning about it. And the arch wiki is just so good - well written and elaborates on nearly anything about everything.

I hope it doesn't sound like I am saying that I don't like Ubuntu or Debian. I really feel they have a place in the linux community, they're awesome beginner systems. I have been using them a long time without too much prior knowledge and I haven't been forced to do any tinkering behind the scenes.

But with the install of arch linux I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my linux journey: learning to tinker. It does also help that it is such a light-weight awesome system with a very good package manager and insanely good community."	t5_2qrzu	True

&gt; **If your current password was created with shadow version prior to 4.1.4.3-3 (2011-11-26) you are using MD5. To start using a SHA-512 hash you just need to change your password with passwd.**


A quick look at *my personal* '**/etc/shadow**' file showed I was using MD5 hashes, and running:

    sudo passwd &lt;user&gt;

and specifying my same password truly updated the '**/etc/shadow**' file entry to a SHA-512 hash. (FYI: only reason I ran '**sudo**' above was so I could specify the *same password*, otherwise '**passwd**' will complain = **Password unchanged**)



sooo, this information is *only relevant* to anyone that has not done a fresh Arch install since 2011-11-26 (or hasn't updated their password since then). a quick search of [/r/archlinux](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux) and a scan of [ArchLinux.org's past News articles](http://www.archlinux.org/news/) I don't see anything referencing this (very helpful, IMHO) piece of information. I'm not saying it's flat-out not there, I just am not seeing it other then on the [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SHA_password_hashes). (I know, you archlinux devs+mods got a whole shit-ton of things going on!)

long time Arch user here, although I never posted anything in this sub.

Yesterday I noticed the [fsf website lists Archlinux as a non-free distribution](http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html), saying that the Linux kernel Arch uses contains proprietary blobs.

I was a little surprised to find out, and actually a bit skeptical. I always assumed that a default Arch install would be in fact all foss, but looking around on the wiki I haven't found anything that confirms that. I only found a couple of paragraphs in which it's explained how Arch gives you freedom to choose to [install non-free software or not](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#Freedom), and that it's [built with openness in mind](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way#Openness). It's a bit blurry imo (maybe deliberately), and doesn't rule out the fsf claims.

So, does anybody know which are (if any) those blobs?

Thanks

Shazzbot	71	10	26	"I've wanted to hop on over to a Linux distro for a long while now, and I was inspired to give Arch Linux a try after reading about the Arch Way. I was intrigued by the idea of the AUR and rolling releases, not to mention being able to easily switch between desktop environments. But singlehandedly, the biggest allure of Arch was the idea of building an operating system that fits me from the ground up; twisting and tinkering with all of the nuts and bolts of the OS.

So I gave it a shot, burned an ISO, and fired up the code crackpipe. Figuring out the very specific issues of my laptop and Xorg was frustrating, but after being on Windows for most of my life, I can say now that I enjoyed the new challenges that Arch presented to me. This installation really humbled me, and I have to say that I've learned a lot about Linux in the process.

1328536899.0	pd5nt	Why do you use Arch?	hairy_asian	72	13	127	"Hello people

I've been using Linux for a few years now. I was a Linux Mint user but with all the recent upstream issues with Gnome and Ubuntu I decided to move to openSUSE which I'm using now. It's a great distro and I'm loving KDE but ever since Gnome 3  and Unity I've been looking for a distro that gives more control to the user.

I've been researching Arch for a little while now to see if it is the distro for me. I have had look at the wiki and I definitely like the philosophy of the Arch Way. Having rolling updates as well is a big bonus for me.

Now I've read some reviews and I've read the wiki but it would be really good to hear from some fellow redditors, who use Arch for their main distro, about their experience. Why do you use Arch?

And one last thing, I don't mind having a tinker with an OS if that means I can get the distro I want, but from what I have read about the nature of Arch, I am a bit worried if the maintenance is more trouble than its worth. Is bug fixing and editing config files a very frequent occurence in Arch to the point that it's just frustrating?

Thank you for any thoughts!




**Edit**: Thanks everyone for your input! There are some really helpful insights here and the more I hear everyone talk about the pros of Arch, the more I feel like becoming an Archer! I'm definitely going to try it out myself now.

**Edit 2**: Well, after what was probably a good 6-8 hours of setting things up, I now have a functioning Arch install running a minimal KDE! I thought the installation was going to be time consuming, but that was pretty straightforward in the end, it was getting everything else up and running after that.

After running Arch for a little while now, I'm beginning to see what everyone was raving about. I haven't seen KDE run as smooth as I have on Arch. Pacman is great! I like the fact that once I get this system fully functional, I won't have to download another ISO again for an update. All I think I gotta do now is get a fully working GUI wireless manager and GUI sound manager and I'll be set. Thanks for all your recommendations!

I have added games that some other redditors have gotten working according to their comments, so it's no longer just games that I've gotten to work. Also take a look at /u/feilen's comments below for some really useful tweaks. 

If you find that any of these games *don't* work, please say so!

Games run perfectly unless stated, are in no particular order within categories and no information about dependencies that were required to run the games is given unless such dependencies are not self-evident in error messages. Some games are ""Steam-only"" (see below); those that are available on Steam and elsewhere should be assumed to work on all platforms unless stated otherwise — bullets that only relate to Steam technical issues are marked accordingly.

/u/flying-sheep's contributions:

* *SPAZ* 

* *Steel Storm* 

— Apparently some graphics bugs using Steam version, but otherwise OK.

* *Limbo*

— This isn't a native game; it's a CrossOver games WINE wrapper with the Windows executable(s). No problems reported with it, though.

* *Botanicula*

* *Vessel*

— Not too fast and looks oddly low-res on native solution, otherwise nice (you have to manually edit the gamepad config)

* *The Binding of Isaac, Wrath of the Lamb-bundled version*

— The game often won't launch (Flash problem?) but when it does, it's fine apart from the fact that it won't render full-screen. 

— Custom-made [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tboi-wotl/) — apparently a bit slow (Flash?) but still faster than other versions.

— Uses Nixstaller for installation, which seems to require explicit 'sudo' permissions and just hangs without them.

— Need to cd to '/usr/local/games/Grimrock' (or installation location) and execute Grimrock.bin.x86_64 directly, or create symbolic link, due to shortcut problem. 

* *Frozen Synapse*

* *Cave Story +*

* *Bastion*

— Another Nixstaller/sudo issue.

— The game runs at 60FPS on Windows with a Steam launch option that I forget now — it's normally locked at 48FPS. As Bastion is not currently available on Steam-for-Linux I haven't been able to dig out that option from Google and test it, and to me the HiB Linux version tested here does appear to be locked at 48 itself (though without an active frame rate counter I can't say for sure).

* *Torchlight*

— Works fine if using the 'torchlight-hib' package from the AUR.

* *Shatter*

— Nixstaller/sudo again. Not found a better way. 

* *Shank 2*

— Game executable apparently won't launch sometimes without root permissions — fairly sure the right value exported for LIB_GL_MESA (or somesuch) will correct this but have yet to test.

— /u/flying-sheep's custom-made [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/shank2/)

* *Dungeons of Dredmor*

* *FTL*

* *Frozen Synapse*

* *Jamestown*

* *Dungeon Defenders*

— Need to run 'ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command' before running through terminal. 

— Game doesn't work in full-screen mode and crashes often, but this seems to be true across distros — apparently fixes are on the way. 

* *Dynamite Jack*

* *Minecraft*

**Steam-only games** (Note: Steam games require 32-bit versions of graphics drivers (in my case, Nvidia) in addition to 64-bit versions — and also often require ""export sdl_audiodriver=alsa"" before running in order to get audio working. Also note that some duplicates appear here as the Steam versions are taken to be independent of the DRM-free standalone installers). 

* *Unity of Command*

— Had to remove libpangoft2-1.0.so.0 from ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Unity of Command Demo/bin to resolve fonts issue (thanks /u/zoku88). 

— Add 'sdl-fullscreen' as a launch option in Steam to run in 'proper' full-screen mode. 

* *Team Fortress 2* 

* *Waveform*

* *Serious Sam 3*

— Performance is a bit poor: the game seems to stutter quite a lot with VSync on but tearing occurs without it on my system, and there is no triple buffering in the game itself. Check out /u/feilen's comments below for some useful tips on how to enable system-wide triple buffering for Nvidia cards — not sure about other GPUs. 

* *Killing Floor* 

* *Cubemen*

**Other games**

* *Baldur's Gate 2* (via GOG) 

— See post by /u/crayZsaaron [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/baldursgate/comments/155cpx/how_to_get_gogs_baldurs_gate_ii_complete_running/)

* *Resonance* (via GOG)

—  Non-native (sort of). Followed this guide — http://www.gog.com/forum/resonance/resonance_linux_gamers — but installed innoextract through the AUR. Works perfectly, no WINE.

I've been using Kernel.org as my mirror for Arch and Debian for years.

Is there anything to be worried about or is it just a knee-jerk reaction on my part?

1314634473.0	jy2l0	How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Gentoo	jdhore1	96	43	63	"I have a feeling i'll likely get flamed for this or downvoted beyond the 7th circle of hell, but i think maybe this could be useful to people. Or not. Yay, apathy! Anyway.

I've been a Archlinux user for well over 3 years by this point. I think it's a pretty good distro, but people seem to forget all the mistakes. These mistakes are why i switched to Gentoo which i'll make more note of in the later part of this post.

* **The /usr/bin/python -&gt; python3 switch** - Python 3 is in no way ready to become /usr/bin/python ANYWHERE and every distro besides Arch seems to realize that. Even the hardcore Python3 fans say Python3 is still a few YEARS away from being usable as /usr/bin/python. Yes, Arch is bleeding edge and all that, but that's no excuse. I was trying to run a python app on a Archlinux server (WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT?!) and it was basically broken with no hope in Arch and we decided to just reformat the server to Debian. Also, WeeChat as an example had to add a bunch of new variables and stuff to their python plugin to make it work with Arch's /usr/bin/python being python3. Not because it was ported to python3, but because it was hacked up to use /usr/bin/python2 on Arch and /usr/bin/python everywhere else, basically.
* **The GNOME3 fiasco** - I know, this has been said a million times now, but GNOME3 is shit IMO. However on Arch, it was pushed WAY too early IMO and there currently is no real way to get GNOME2. I know there's Mate, but Mate is really the wrong way to do a fork. Also, because of Arch's stupid policies of doing rebuilds for every soname bump instead of multiple, versioned packages for a library or slotting like Gentoo, you can't just IgnorePkg all the GNOME packages and update your system as normal. If you want to do that, you have to watch VERY closely when a soname rebuild happens and rebuild the relevant GNOME packages yourself and go through hell on big bumps like libpng.
* **Optdepends** - I'm a developer, just think of how this sounds. Parts of your application on Archlinux will be linked against libraries that may or may not exist on a users' system. That is just RETARDED. I'm sorry, but there's no other word for it.
* I already touched on soname rebuilds and i think it's better to do versioned libraries or slotting as i said, so i'm not going to go over it again.
* **The ridiculous stabilization process** - As we all probably know, most packages don't hit testing at all, just really soname rebuilds, new versions of core packages and a big suite upgrade (like KDE 4.6 -&gt; 4.7 or GNOME 2.30 -&gt; 2.32). I think this is a mistake, but we'll let that slide. For the packages that do require signoffs, the process is simply 2 signoffs per arch. It doesn't have to have been in the repo for a certain amount of time, the devs don't have to check the bugtracker or forums for users having (possibly massive) issues. This is a HUGE mistake IMO. This is partially why i recommend NO ONE run Archlinux on a server.
* **Bleeding edge to a degree that breaks things** - As of a while ago, for probably about 2 weeks, jre/jdk(7) was the only closed-source Java package and (IIRC) there's a MASSIVE bug in Java 7 that still hasn't been fixed. They've fixed this, but it still got into the tree for a while. Perl 5.14 is currently stable in Arch (and a core package on top of that) which means if you're an Android dev/ROM maker, you can not build Android from source on Archlinux because part pf the build is broken due to perl 5.14 changing stuff and some regular old perl modules won't build. There are just 2 examples, but i'm sure i could find a lot more if i chose to.

Now. Why I went to Gentoo and why you should too:

1. The compile times aren't really an issue anymore if you have a modern system. Computers have gotten a lot faster, software hasn't gotten all that much bigger. If i were to just count compile times for my stage3 install + X + Alsa + GNOME + Xulrunner + Firefox (not built against xulrunner, so basically double the xulrunner compile time, also, you don't have to compile Firefox, there's firefox-bin) + other sundry apps on my Desktop which is effectively a Core i7 with 8 ""cores"", it was MAYBE 2 hours. A bit more because i was faffing about trying to get my USE flags and stuff just so, but i'm anal. I also installed pretty much the same setup (main difference: firefox-bin instead of firefox) on my beater laptop which is a 2.2GhZ single-core Celeron and it took less than 8 hours.
2. Gentoo is **NOT** for ricers. Sure, there are ricers using it, there are ricers using Arch too, but 95% (probably more) of Gentoo users are just using simple, sane CFLAGS.
3. Gentoo's biggest gain is not performance. I want to make that clear. The performance is a nice bonus, but 8 hours of compiling for a 1 second speed increase when opening Firefox is not what it's about.
4. Gentoo is actually stable. For a package to go into the stable tree, it must have been in the tree for at least 30 days and have no new bugs against it (that aren't also against the stable version). This keeps Gentoo EXTREMELY stable (effectively, as much so as Debian Stable), but it's SO EASY and POSSIBLE to pull in single packages from testing that even for a desktop, it's great. I don't care about my Glibc being bleeding-edge, but I do want my bleeding-edge git and vim...I can do that on Gentoo.
5. Gentoo is truly simple. As one example, data for installed packages is stored in a set of plain-text files in the /var/db/pkg/* directories and because of it being that simple, there are 3 package managers you can use with Gentoo and unlike Arch, they're not all just frontends to the same primary package manager.
6. Relating to #3 and #4, what makes Gentoo so great is **CHOICE**. You get to choose what dependencies and features of a package you want, you get to choose what version of a package you want (pretty much forever with only a tiny bit of work if need be) and that is absolutely awesome.

Really, switching to Gentoo is one of the best decisions i've ever made and i'm going to switch more of my boxes to it when I have time.

This should go at the bottom, but tl;dr's are always best at the bottom. I'm happy to help any prospective Gentoo users learn more and possibly switch and i'm happy to discuss this more with y'all, let's keep it constructive though, eh?

**tl;dr - You should really read the whole post, but it seems like Arch is going down a hole of getting worse and worse and Gentoo may in fact be entering its golden age (possibly again).**"	t5_2qrzu	True

One of the tips they tell you in the wiki is that you should read the pkgbuild before you install something from the AUR. I have one issue with that. I look at the pkgbuild and I don't know what I'm reading. I can see that the pkgbuild nominates a server to download packages from but I have no idea what it's actually pulling from the net.

I guess my main question is, what do you look out for in the pkgbuild which could appear to be malicious?

I moved to Arch for ~~stability~~ (Arch is more bleeding edge than I had initially thought so never mind), and this sort of scares me, as I don't want to have to repair Arch during the school year if a project is due. 

How often should I be updating? ASAP, or what? Or just not at all (that sounds like a bad idea). Thanks for the help.

For me, it's everything about it; the package manager is not invasive unlike apt and is reasonably fast. The PKGBUILD layout makes sense and it didn't take long for me to understand it and make my own packages.
Then there's the control aspect of it.

If I install a package, it doesn't automatically run as a daemon. This was (and still is in a way) a thing I really had trouble understanding why anyone would ever want to have the system automatically start a daemon once installed. It just seems so.. non-Unixy.

Then there's the rolling release aspect of it. Full releases haven't ever made sense for me.

Oh and the fact that most things are fairly vanilla. The package maintainers don't touch things that don't need to be touched. It's KISS  when it's best.

And finally, can someone explain to me why my boss thinks that Arch is unstable? I've used Arch since the middle of 2009 and haven't had my Arch system(s) break in a way that wasn't caused by my own misconfiguration. The only scenario I can recall would have been the version update of libjpeg and libpng back in late 2009 that broke a ton of AUR packages.

1370058394.0	1fg3y9	Guide to running Windows 7 in QEMU		49	11	17	"I was trying to get this working earlier and found it a bit confusing, so here's a little guide that might come in handy for people who are forced to use Windoze for work or school. For those who are unfamiliar, QEMU is a pretty simple, straightforward virtual machine manager that works with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine hypervisor built into Linux.

First install the QEMU package.

    # pacman -S qemu

Next create the disk image that Windows will be installed into. I would recommend keeping the disk image and install ISO in the same folder, mine is ~/machines/windows. I created a 40GB image, which will plenty for what I need, but you might want more or less. I would also use the qcow2 format, which doesn't automatically take up all the space you've allotted before the virtual machine uses it.

    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 40G

Next you'll need to either copy a Windows 7 ISO from a disc or download a legal ISO from Microsoft. If the former, insert your Windows disc and, preferably in the machine-specific folder you created for the disk image, copy the iso to your hard drive. The device name of your ODD will likely be /dev/sr0, but if it's something different make sure to modify the command.

    $ dd if=/dev/sr0 of=install.iso

If you don't have a CD, you'll need to download an official ISO from Microsoft. Make sure you download the version that matches your serial key. If you don't have a key, there's something you can use called Daz Loader, but I won't condone that in my post (wink, wink). Download the ISO [here](http://www.w7forums.com/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads-t12325.html). Rename it to something sane like **install.iso** and move it to the folder you have the disk image saved in.

Next you need to enable KVM, which will allow the virtual machine to access your hardware much more directly than software emulation. To use KVM, you need an Intel processor with VT-x capability or an AMD processor with AMD-V. If the former, enter

    # modprobe kvm_intel

If the latter:

    # modprobe kvm_amd

We also probably want these modules to load at boot. To set this up, make a .conf file in modprobe.d called something that describes what it loads. Mine is vt-x.conf, but it doesn't matter what it's called.

    # nano /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf

In this file, add either

    kvm_intel

or

    kvm_amd

depending on your processor. Now the modules will be present after a reboot.

From here on out I'm going to assume your disk image is called disk.qcow2, your ISO is called install.iso, and you are in the folder containing both of these files. Now we can start up the virtual machine. I'm assuming that you're running this on a 64-bit system (if not, try ""qemu-i386"" instead of ""qemu-system-x8664"". I set the memory that the virtual machine can use to 4096MB, which is around half the total RAM of my system. Again, modify this based on your system and how much RAM you think the VM needs (keeping in mind that Windows requires 1GB of RAM for i386 and 2GB for x86_ 64).

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -cdrom install.iso -boot d disk.qcow2

This will start the VM in a new window. Go through the install process. Once everything is running, you can begin the hellish Windows Update process. You'll probably have to check and install updates three or four times before they're all covered. Now you've got Windows up and running on your machine, quarantined from your pure, virginal Linux system.

To start your VM after shutting it down, you will need to specify all the attributes again, besides for the install ISO. I have a script called windows.sh with the following contents:

    qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -vga std -daemonize ~/machines/windows/disk.qcow2

This adds a few commands that make the script more useful. ""-vga std"" lets the machine's resolution be adjusted beyond 1024x768. ""-daemonize"" detaches the QEMU process from the terminal, so that you don't have to leave it open while your machine is running.

Some more handy tips: press ctrl-alt to free the mouse from the virtual machine, and ctrl-alt-2 to open the QEMU command line, which allows commands like ""quit"".

Good luck!

EDIT: 
Some further notes:

If you using a tiling window manager, I would recommend setting qemu-system-x86_64 to float automatically, or else Windows will look blurry and distorted due to it's been resized.

SOUND: So I've been playing around with sound for a while, and I believe I've found the solution. I'm going to do a full reinstall before I confirm anything, of course. After trying a bunch of things, the necessary steps seem to be as follows.

First you need to set the QEMU audio driver to ALSA, since it defaults to OSS and makes sound not work.

    $ export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=alsa

You probably want this to be persistent, so add a line to your .bash_profile, .profile, or whatever autostart file you use.

    $ nano ~/.bash_profile

Add line:

    export QEMU_AUDIO_DRV=alsa

Now that the QEMU audio is set right, boot Windows 7 with the -soundhw ac97 command:

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -vga std -daemonize -soundhw ac97 ~/machines/windows/disk.qcow2

Download the Realtek AC97 driver for Windows 7 from [this page](http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=23&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false). Download this file on the Windows machine, not the host.

Right click &gt; ""Extract all"" from the .zip you just downloaded

Run the executable named ""setup"" in the folder you just extracted

This will run the whole install process, then ask you to reboot. After you reboot you should hear the ear-grating Windows startup noise and sound should work fine."	t5_2qrzu	True

1336823769.0	tjjwr	archlinux: a how-to in troubleshooting for newcomers.	zendeavor	58	20	15	"hi, i'm zendeavor. you may have seen me on #archlinux and i'm an asshole. what follows is the reason why i hate your ignorant questions and inability to help yourself. it also doubles as an introduction to arch, and a how-to for troubleshooting (because if you don't do these things before you show up in irc, you're going to waste *everyone's* time while we send you on a hunt for the errors and logs we need. then we'll flame you. deal with it.)

so, i hear you like arch. that's great, welcome to the community! have you used linux before? if no, then you've chosen a **fantastic**, *user-friendly* distribution from which to build a strong foundation of knowledge and experience. don't believe me? you're just scared. the beginner's guide is long, the installation guide is dense, the wiki is overloaded with information. i understand how this can make you wary.

if you have used linux before, was it based on ubuntu? yes? i'm sorry for your misfortune. i mean no ill-will, but you've been misled about how computing works in a linux environment so it's best if you just forget you wasted all that time. i feel the same about coming to arch from ubuntu-spins as i do about coming to linux from windows or osx. the difficulty is not in learning linux(arch) but is derived from *forgetting* windows/osx(ubuntu). are you ready to get started? let's begin.

there's only one thing you need to understand: **troubleshooting**. how does one learn to troubleshoot? well, it's really common sense, but let me guide you through a few steps.

so you've encountered an erroneous application in your system; congratulations! here's what to do.

ask yourself, first; is this a graphical application, or a commandline application? if it's graphical...**stop clicking it** because that won't help anyone determine a problem and when you come crying for our assistance, here's the first thing we'll say. *run the program from your terminal and show us any relevant errors or warnings it prints.* this applies to both types of apps, so abuse your newfound power with each.

did this spit out any reasonably useful information? if yes, **google the errors and warnings exactly as they printed on your screen** and then, if the results are too narrow, widen them by removing references to details of your specific machine; this includes absolute paths, process ids, timestamps, and a variety of other things that you will easily spot.

if no useful information is printed, then it's time to hit the manpage. we're looking for two specific words. *debug* and *verbose*. generally, you can just assume that -v == verbosity (and multiple occurrences of -v, such as -vvv, or -v -v -v will be higher levels of verbosity) but sometimes it is a synonym for --version. the -d flag takes on a multitude of different meanings, such as daemonize(background the process after starting, almost like appending `&amp;' to the command), debug(self-explanatory), or even detach[ed] (in tmux, -d is a common flag used for starting a window or session without immediately focusing it). so for simplicity's sake, just check the manpage. it takes less than a minute, and if we have to do it **for you** then we're going to be irritated(and you may get no help at all if we determine that you are a help vampire). so now you've looked that over, try running the application again with verbosity and debug levels cranked up. now try google again.

still stuck? that's okay, you're trying and that is **all** we ask of you. another trick is to try googling the symptoms you are experiencing, and the application name ""in quotes"", e.g. ""myapp"" crashes when i open a plaintext file. use google's search options to narrow it down, if this problem did not exist before by choosing to search for results from the past week or month. also, maybe just throw in ""archlinux"" as an extra search keyword. you should notice a trend! see if you can spot it real quick..........

did you figure it out? lots of results will be from arch's bbs! this is a hint that maybe you should check there for similar problems and potential solutions if or when google fails you. so that's your next task. check the arch bbs and wiki for more help before coming to us in #archlinux =]

still no fixes? that's okay, as long as you're still with me here. now you want to check something else that's very simple. do you suspect a recent update to the package/software/system introduced the problem? don't downgrade yet! instead, try `less /var/log/pacman.log` and then hit G. capital g. it will drop you down the end of the log. j and k scroll, or you can use the arrow keys. use '/' or '?' to search for a term forward or backward, respectively. see what packages were upgraded lately, and determine their relationship with the program you are having problems with. **then** and **only then** is it okay to try downgrading, but for a specific reason. we want to determine if this is a bug introduced in an updated package. so you will use something akin to `pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/package-version.string.pkg.tar.xz` and try to run your program again. does the problem persist? if no, congratulations! you now have a bug to report to us at bugs.archlinux.org, so please assist the community by doing so. if the issue still occurs, you can try downgrading the libraries or other dependencies of the application in question and further pinpoint a problem, but i would never expect you to go this far, usually not worth the trouble involved because so many other apps may have to be downgraded in the process...quite a rabbit hole. also, pacman often spits out information regarding the packages you install if some manual intervention is desirable or necessary. this should be in the pacman log as well, but if it's not you can check the post_install() function from the $pkg.install script(this is easiest to find by using the [abs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ABS_-_The_Arch_Build_System)). alternatively, you can just install the package again and pacman will print it neatly to your console. verify that you have taken any necessary steps outlined there.

the next step is to check your configurations. did you change any settings recently? change them back and see if the problem still occurs. then, take care of your [pacnews](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacnew_and_Pacsave_Files) and try the program again.

the final step is almost completely optional. **almost**. generally no one gets irritated if you leave this one out, but i mention it for completeness' sake. check bugtrackers. look at arch's [own](http://bugs.archlinux.org) and the bugtracker of the application in question(sorry, you'll have to google that one, but a quick hint can be found with `pacman -Si pkgname`)

if you're still stuck, you may now come see us in irc! simply drop by, and ask your question **directly**. no metaquestions(anyone here? anyone use this program? anyone know if this program has a bug?) because they won't help anyone. be sure to tell us what you have already done to troubleshoot or fix the problem, or otherwise you will have to field a half-dozen questions from us like ""did you check the bbs? did you google it? does the bug persist in older versions? have you done a `pacman -Syu` recently? did you check our wiki page yet?"" and that is undesirable. so let us know what you've done, drop us a link or two to results that offered solutions that did not work for you, and also drop us a link to a pastebin of some error or warning output from your console(we are partial to [sprunge](http://sprunge.us) and [gist](http://gist.github.com), for what it's worth. pastebin.com is discouraged). be patient, and someone will be there soon to help you out. the beautiful thing is that we will be capable of getting right down to the root of the problem much quicker than if we had to hold your hand through all these steps, so we all can spend much less time on the problem and will have you back in working condition in a shorter timeframe than would otherwise be possible!

and that's it! if you follow these steps, you will inevitably be solving problems **all by yourself**. some experience is required to get the hang of this task, but as you can see it's really not so monumental. with experiences comes wisdom and knowledge and i can tell you from my *own* experiences, this will become second nature to you after exercising these practices only a few times.

so please, help yourself before you come asking for someone to spoonfeed you solutions. arch is not for the faint of heart. it requires some determination on the end-user's behalf. trust me though. it pays off big."	t5_2qrzu	True

1266680898.0	b4e9i	Cause /r/archlinux should know...	gnuvince	47	11	15	"Two months ago, I started going to school again and because my new apartment is not very big, I left my desktop PC at my parents' place and bought a Laptop (MSI CR600).

I'd been using Arch Linux for about 6 months at home at that point, but I installed Ubuntu on the laptop because I figured I would have less problems with exotic hardware since Ubuntu is currently the most popular distribution.

As soon as the installation was finished, I was getting weird ata messages at the console every 10 seconds.  Since I was always in X and that it didn't seem to affect the rest of the system, I just ignored it.

I then tried to configure my wireless card, a Ralink RT3090.  The driver is available only in Linux 2.6.32; Karmic ships with 2.6.31. Doh!  Fortunately, I found a PPA repository with the driver.  The installation worked flawlessly and I was quickly able to connect to my network with wicd.

Fast forward a month and a half, I perform an `apt-get upgrade` and I see that the rt3090-dkms package has been updated.  I reboot my laptop and as soon as wicd tries to connect to my network, kernel panic.  (wicd wasn't updated.)

I tried reverting to the old package version, but it wouldn't install because the module couldn't be built against the kernel (which had a couple of packaging updates).

I talked with the developers of wicd and with the maintainer of the rt3090-dkms package and neither party knew why this happened or how I could fix it.

Being fed up with not being to use my wireless card, I installed Arch this weekend.  The kernel that was installed was 2.6.32 and my wireless card was (almost) instantly usable.  I installed wicd and in 3 seconds I was connected and my kernel was still humming happily.  Bonus points, I don't have the ata errors anymore either.  One big pacman command later and my laptop was fully functional with all my software and configurations.

The actual development of PKGBUILDer started at the end of August 2011, and it has improved greatly since then.  I just released 2.1.4.4.  Although the numbering started at 2.0, because 1.0 is the version number for the original Perl “script” (rewritten in 10 lines of Bash).  Since then, nearly every line changed in some way.  I did not make too many public announcements, though, since I believed that it was not quite ready for that.  2.1.4.0 was a release which was neatly ready for primetime.  With help of fosskers (the guy behind aura, another AUR helper, that was also announced here lately), I fixed the last bugs, added downgrade functionalities and I think I got it right this time.

PKGBUILDer is an AUR helper with many useful features.  They include:

 * `pb` wrapper for pacman and PKGBUILDer (`-Shv` are taken and worked with, everything else is dropped down to pacman)
 * pacman-style output (`-S` flag activates)
 * translations support (looking for translators, the docs contain a guide)
 * user-friendly
 * no useless questions, it b
 * very, VERY fast (AUR) `-[Sy]u`
 * AUR downgrade warnings with `-[Sy]u`
 * Python 3 + pyalpm, meaning everyting is using a nice library rather than cheap pacman calls. (I do call `makepkg` though, but I cannot do anything else.  I also ask the shell to take the dependencies out, because (ba)sh is too complex to be parsed by other things)

I’d love to see some comments, hints and contributions.  Thanks in advance!

Too bad, that conflicts with the Haskell libs needed by xmonad.  Even using only the 3rd party Haskell repos gives issues (Yes, I've -Rcns everything from standard Arch repos).  The whole thing gives me flashbacks of dependency hell on Slackware.

And the problem isn't just with xmonad/git-annex.  There's been a few times where I want to build just xmonad-darcs from a fresh install, and it's turtles all the way down with dep issues, build errors, etc.  What a headache.

1365686782.0	1c4sf8	Are tools like Laptop Mode Tools needed with modern kernels?	vassie	37	2	16	"Hello

I have been running Arch (with KDE) on my Dell Latitude E6400 for a few months now and am very happy with it, however I was reading up about [Laptop Mode Tools](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop_Mode_Tools), it says you should have a CPU frequency driver installed so I installed cpupower, however the wiki entry for [CPU Frequency Scaling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_Frequency_Scaling) sates

&gt;Since kernel 3.4 the necessary modules are loaded automatically and the recommended ondemand governor is enabled by default.

With this in mind, do I really need Laptop Mode Tools?

If so, what tips, recommendations do you have on running Arch on a laptop (especially an E6400)?

They're as close to a ""vanilla"" install as I can make them without making them non-functional on EC2. But here's the list of differences between the EC2 builds and a stock install:

* Kernel modules included in initrd, some of which are only there for the initial bootstrap (which I do in KVM): virtio virtio-blk virtio-net virtio-pci virtio-ring xen-blkfront xen-fbfront xen-kbdfront xen-netfront xen-pcifront xen-privcmd button ipmi-msghandler ipmi-poweroff

* Packages removed: initscripts, sysvinit

* Extra packages installed: netcfg, openssh, dhclient, ec2-keyring, ec2-pacman-mirrors, rng-tools, systemd-sysvcompat

* Added an extra package source for ec2-specific packages. the repository currently contains: ec2-keyring, ec2-pacman-mirrors, package-query, yaourt.  I'm working on porting cloud-init to Arch Linux so that we don't use the really funky rc.local setup I have it currently using.

* systemd used instead of sysvinit. I also have a flag in my build process which allows me to build it with sysvinit as the default, but I think since systemd is the future I'll keep that the default for now.

* Additional services enabled at boot: rngd, sshd, netcfg 

* User's public key is pulled from the EC2 instance metadata service at startup, and added to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

* SSH configured with 'PasswordAuthentication no', enforcing public key authentication

* pacman loads (and automatically lsigns) the 'archlinux' and 'ec2' keyrings on the first boot (the latter keyring contains my public key used for package signing in the ec2 repo).

* pacman mirror list is automatically selected at boot based on a list I created (based on rankmirrors run on instances in each region). These lists are provided by the package ec2-pacman-mirrors, which is in the ec2 repo.

* dhclient is used instead of dhcpcd for robustness reasons. I found that dhcpcd gave up too quickly if it tried to do a DHCPREQUEST when the vif wasn't completely up, making the EC2 instance inaccessible.

* dhclient is configured to retry forever, and request the following dhcp options: subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name, interface-mtu, fqdn

* /usr/bin/pinentry is symlinked to /usr/bin/pinentry-curses instead of the default pinentry-gtk, since gtk isn't available in this install and the primary access method is SSH.

There is one major caveat I know of at the moment. If you launch one of these and create an EBS AMI snapshot based on your instance, any launches of the derived AMI can only be accessed by your SSH key pair. This means you effectively cannot share any derived AMIs unless you first remove /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/* before snapshotting. This is one of the reasons I'm investigating cloud-init.

Anyway, please try it out and let me know what you think. I welcome feedback.  Send any Arch Linux on EC2 specific bug reports to me via reddit for now. If this takes off I'll see if I can get a proper bug tracker somewhere."	t5_2qrzu	True

Now I am running flashplayer-10.3-183, and it works great, no R-B inversion and strange flash on black regions of the screen.

I have put the x86_64 file here: http://www.liacs.nl/~tgehrman/flashplugin-10.3.183.7-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz, so if you trust me then you can grab a copy, and if you don't, then I suppose maybe you could ask a friend.

Just letting you know that it works fine, and I guess I'll stick with it until adobe fixes it, or until I die, whichever comes first...

1331647421.0	quj25	Looking for a new terminal emulator. Any suggestions?	The-Good-Doctor	32	2	62	"Since installing Arch for the first time, I find myself with an unexpected problem: Since so little has been chosen for me already, I have more choice than I know what to do with. Not that this is a bad thing, in fact I'm using it as an opportunity to explore software I haven't used before. Right now I'm trying to find a good terminal emulator, and I'd appreciate some suggestions.

Most of the time, I've stuck with Gnome Terminal, since it's often the default. What I like about it:

* copy/paste from the clipboard across applications with ctrl+shift+c and ctrl+shift+v.
* multiple tabs, and the ability to bind my own key combinations to switching tabs
* can choose a custom font and a font rendering style (through the Gnome preferences menu) that is respected by the terminal

What I don't like about it:

* Annoying to copy my color scheme preferences from one machine to another, since Gnome Terminal doesn't seem to use xresources.
* The way it handles alt-key combinations is apparently different from other terminals in a way that Vim doesn't like.
* Having to use the Gnome preferences menu to tweak the font settings, rather than having a simple config file I can copy from one machine to another.
* I seem to recall that there were a few other minor annoyances, but I can't think of them right now.

Another important thing to note is that I'm not using Gnome in my Arch install, so I don't see the point in using its terminal emulator. I'm using xterm right now, but I'm finding it annoying when I want to copy something from my web browser into the terminal (e.g. URLs, script snippets), and I also miss having tabs.

I don't really need a lot of features, but the clipboard support is important to me, and I'd really like to be able to use an xresources dotfile to configure it. I find tabs very useful, but I could probably survive without them if I had to. A lightweight solution would be nice, but I don't have a particular need for something especially lean.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a terminal that would work well for my needs?

I'm not really sure how to explain what I mean, but here's a shot.

I've installed Tiling WMs in the past, and they're not quite my ideal. I've noticed that my favorite way of managing windows is for me to have the window extend from the top to the bottom of the screen, and overlap with other windows to the left and right, with no window completely covering the others. It's sort of like a tab system for windows, but I can partially see the contents of all of them. To activate, I just click on the one I'd like to see.

Ideally it would have window controls on the exposed side of the window, and would be able to intelligently rearrange the windows so that all of them can be accessed at once. For instance if I have three windows open, and I raise the first, then the last, the middle window should slide over to the left or the right part of the screen so that it would remain visible, instead of getting lost like it does in a floating WM.

I don't know if it's exactly as efficient as a tiling window manager, but I do know that with large, multiple monitors I very rarely maximize or minimize anything.

how exactly does this second part work?

Aura is a package manager for Arch Linux with full support for installing and upgrading AUR packages.
With version 1.1 it has many new features to make managing your system easier.

## New with Version 1.1
 * `--save` option. Stores a record of all installed packages.
 * `--restore` option. Restores a state stored with `--save`. Good for reversing system breakage.
 * `-k` suboption of `-A`. Shows PKGBUILD diffs when installing / upgrading.
 * `--aurignore` option. Ignores given AUR packages when installing / upgrading.
 * Bash and zsh completions now available.
 * Aura now reads pacman-color's /etc/pacman.d/color.conf if available. This affects the colours in `-Ai` and `-As`.
 * Aura now stores the most recent PKGBUILD when installing a package. This is so `-Ak` has something to diff with when upgrading next.
 * Much cleaner code.

## On the Horizon
 * Fish completions.
 * Reworked PKGBUILD parser.
 * Haskell binding to libalpm.

A big thanks to all of Aura's users! I couldn't have got this far without your support.

1346217920.0	z089z	My trusty arch desktop is nearly perfect as I see it. But I wish I knew how to fix one small annoyance.		29	3	65	"I have an old dell desktop, one with the 915 intel display EDIT: and a NVIDIA Geforce 8400GS(Which I havent set up yet)

Anyways, the old intel hasn't failed me yet.

The problem is, when I shutdown my computer. It just starts right back up. It even happened on my previous linux distros, but never happened when I used to have Windows a couple years ago.


Anybody know any tricks I could try? I cant seem to find anything relevant on the subject. Ive searched but nothing seems to fix it.


I know as soon as the bios comes up I can just press power again and it will stay down, but it just bothers me.


Also Im using the new systemd set up.



Edit: I have included the ""i915"" module. That didnt help.

Edit2: Ill also try to remove my dlink wifi card and an nvidia geforce 8400 card too (Both currently not in use). I ran across something in google that mentioned this happening with certain graphics cards. Still though.There must be a workaround, cause I may need to enable those cards in the future.

Edit 3:Removing the graphics card allows it to shutdown. Which sucks because i want to migrate to that card... Any suggestions?

Edit 4: Still no luck with any of the suggestions, everyone that gave advice, I upvoted. Thanks everyone. And if anyone else thinks they might know, please chime in!

Edit 5: I'm now actually using the NVIDIA card with fully working nvidia drivers, and the problem continues. Like I said, everything is functional except for shutdown..

Am I missing out?	johnmcdonnell	37	10	55	"I recently started running Arch on my iMac at work with `xmonad` and `dzen` making up pretty much my entire interface. This is my first linux desktop experience. I'm not interested in a desktop interface, per se, but some administrative things seem to be a hassle without one. For example I haven't gotten `gnome-keychain` to work (although admittedly I haven't tried very hard) and I haven't figured out a good solution for making my screen locker go on automatically after a period of inactivity.

Gnome seems to have millions of features I don't want/need, and uses `xml` for config which I'm allergic to. I was looking at maybe using lxde, but looking at the feature lists, etc., it seems mostly oriented around wrapping things up in a gui which isn't my goal.

I guess my basic question is, do desktop managers have important administrative features I'm missing out on? Or do they mostly just wrap up linux configuration with gui control panels?

For some reason I switched from arch and went back to trying other distros like ubuntu, fedora ect... Why did I ever leave? After using arch every other distro leaves a lot to be desired. Ubuntu always has some sort of annoying bug due to its heavily patched packages (in 11.10 the annoying bug winner is 3 finger tap on my touchpad doesn't work at all due to a debian patch in the xorg synaptic driver)

I tried fedora 16, but quickly hated that. I actually enjoyed using F15, but 16 seems like a sloppy release. Several of the gnome-shell extensions in the official repos weren't even compatible with gnome 3.2 for example, and for some reason my favorite gnome-shell-mediaplayer extension flat out refused to load, even though it worked fin in every other gnome 3.2 distro I'd tried among other issues.

Arch seems like its still by far the best gnome 3 experience you can get, and the aur really makes my life easier.

Hey fellow Arch lovers. Thanks for all the help [the first time around.](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/l62wo/so_close_yet_so_far_away_problems_with_arch/)

I've been blissfully using Arch for over a month now. I'm dual-booting on a Macbook Pro. However this morning, upon waking as usual, booting up my Arch install yielded the dreaded:


GRUB _


...much to my horror. Most of the battle with the Arch install the first time around was from GRUB, and not arch itself. Eventually through some perfect sequence of events the GRUB menu would load, and from there I had my Arch. As of this morning it seems GRUB finally had enough of me.

I've been across all edges of the internet to try and find a solution. No amount of reinstalling GRUB has worked. I suspected my device.map file was funny, but upon another grub-install it restored to the same thing (which does not show my partitions. I couldn't determine what a device.map file is ""supposed"" to look like.)

I love Arch way too much to give it up, and I've done too much setting up, etc, in this install to wipe it and start over from scratch. What could the problem be? Could an update have messed something up? Is my MBR shot? I just have no idea.

Please and thank you for any help you can offer.


**EDIT:** Can someone who dual-boots satisfy my curiosity and post their device.map?

**EDIT 2:** On a Macbook Pro booting with REFIT. I then choose Linux, and get the GRUB _

**EDIT 3:** In my REFIT menu I've always had THREE choices:

* Boot MAC OS X from Macintosh HD

* Boot Linux from HD

* Boot Linux from Partition 3

The second option is the one I always used with Arch. I think it's a leftover (somehow) of my Mint install (which I no longer have), but it always worked so I used it. NOW the second option stops at the Tux logo about half the time, the other half making it to the GRUB _ state. The third option which I had never before tried makes it to GRUB _ every time. What's going on here? Partition 3 is incidentally where Arch, and GRUB, are installed.

**EDIT 4:** I tried booting with both a USB plugged in AND the Arch live CD in. When I selected the third boot option (boot from partition 3), **the Live CD loaded** which it would not do normally. Is my internal device map / partition table f-ed?

**SOLVED** FINALLY. Turned out the MBR was fucked. Had to poke around on my OSX side. Using:

sudo fdisk -u /dev/disk0

cleared up the MBR. Reinstalling GRUB one last time fixed everything up. Thanks for all your patience!"	t5_2qrzu	True

Connections picked up faster than nm-applet, and I didn't have to play the guessing game with nm-applet in dwm because I didn't have to worry about a system tray icon.

Now, I constantly dread putting my computer to sleep. When I wake it up, I go over to Wicd, scan the network list, and click connect on *any* network. Wicd takes about 2-3 *minutes* to authenticate, and fails getting an IP address. After trying for maybe 4 or 5 times, it works. Rebooting fixes it until I sleep again... at the moment, it's just faster to reboot than it is to keep trying to connect until it just works.

I've tried installing dhclient and using it instead of dhcpd, but that doesn't work. What am I doing wrong here? As much as I love my computer when it manages to connect, waiting for 15 minutes before my computer gets a connection is a bit unreasonable.

I have interest in programming, I love roguelikes, and I've always been interested in hacker culture too. I decided the other day to finally just install ubuntu and mess around a bit. I installed a few things, downloaded and compiled and played liberal crime squad via SVN in terminal, basically just silly things for a few hours. Looking at /r/unixporn there's some really really nice layouts there. I'm student graphic designer, and I just love looking at things like that. So I said fuck it, I'm just going straight to arch. 

I tried installing last night via CD, ran into some issues of it not finding the drive on the 30s search or whatever that is, eventually got it to work, had some weird update issues that I think is because I didn't put in my own mirror-list/edit it, the one it was trying to connect to, it couldn't connect apparently, but it kept going anyways so I think my install was kinda botched anyways. I was also trying to install on my USB hdd which was probably a silly idea anyways without trying to install for a USB manner. I figured I would try though either way. I think I managed to get through the entire install process, but for obvious reasons I can't boot into it via USB HDD.

Also in the process setting up the swap partition, I accidentally formatted my windows drive, which was amusing in a way, I was planning on reformatting anyways. 

Losing is fun, I plan on trying again tonight.

But I do have a question, and that is, even though my USB HDD is somewhat slow compared to a regular HDD, how much does that effect the performance of it all? Or would it be better/easier to just make a linux partition on one of my drives. Also, say my 3 drives are full partition spaces, would I have to wipe the entire thing to make a new small partition, or can it just slice it from the free space?

EDIT: Whelp, 5-6 hours later this next day, and I got it all working perfectly, and using the xfce DE for right now, take that arch.

But those dependencies are actually needed so I don't know what it's complaining about. When installing their arch binary and doing pacman -Qi openteacher it displayed those as dependencies.

The wiki was not enough so I also looked at http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bo/boa-constructor/PKGBUILD when creating mine.

I followed one guide for installing Arch via FTP maybe a year ago. And I have booted Arch maybe dozen or so times, :(

Now, a relatively lot of time later, I have quite a lot free time during the Summer break, so I decided to try to focus more on Arch. But I have few issues. 

Since I haven't used Arch (nor other distro) for a long time, I forgot many of the ""things"". So, I have a dilemma, should I try to install Arch again, from scratch, and build it again to my needs, or there is some way to delete any additional packages I installed (like KDE) and have a ""clear"" copy of core Arch files? I know some basic pacman commands which get me a list of installed packages (long list), but there is quite a few of them, and I don't really know (nor remember) which ones did I install additionally and which ones are some system packages.

EDIT: Up and running on that ""old"" arch, details in one of the posts below :)

1296367952.0	fbox1	Outliner Lighto, the console-based outliner, now on Arch :-)	badsectoracula	26	2	6	"I [mentioned the program a couple of days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/fanz1/so_i_wrote_this_console_outliner_program_in/) in the /r/linux subreddit, but here is a small repeat of what it is about: Outliner Lighto is a console-based outliner (an outliner is an hierarchical text editor, or an editor of a tree structure with text in each node if you like - it can be used for todo lists, tasks, calendars, addresses, documents, blog articles or whatever else you can think that belongs to some sort of hierarchy or list). As a program it is inspired by (and is similar to) hnb, although it has a few more and a few less features.

I'm using Arch Linux and today i decided to see if i can put it in AUR since i see all sorts of interesting stuff there. Well, one hour later the tool is available as the `ol-git` package (i don't have a versioned release yet so i followed the `-git` naming that seems to be used for such packages). It downloads the source from the [git repository](https://github.com/badsector/ol), builds it with [FreePascal](http://freepascal.org/), installs the binaries for the program and a utility to convert hnb files and finally docs and manpages for the program, the utility and the file format. I believe it is a generally complete package, but i would *really* like feedback on it, since it is the first package i ever make (for any distribution, not just Arch).

Now, having said the above, i must confess that coming from a Debian (and Ubuntu) background this feels like having too much power :-P. I mean, here i am just one hour after learning these things and the program is already available for people to install with `yaourt` or similar front-ends. This is a great contrast to my Debian experience of having my Nikwi game being added in the repositories more than a year later after i made the release (i'll add it in AUR at some point later, but it needs *much* more work than Outliner Lighto, mostly because it is a codebase i haven't touched since 2006).

Anyway. I would like to hear comments about my PKGBUILD file (and it's effects :-P). Beyond installing it (it depends on the FreePascal compiler so you might not want to install that) you can also check it online [via the Github browser](https://github.com/badsector/ol/blob/master/dists/arch/PKGBUILD) since i made it part of the source code repository."	t5_2qrzu	True

My netbook has had Arch since the day the machine came home.  I'll admit I'm a lazy admin and never give a shit as long as things work.  Lately I've had them both out in places without internet and gotten quite bored, and noticed a HUGE difference between the two.  Both have 2gb.  The Arch box was using around 300mb of RAM on boot, with manual startx, chromium, pidgin, and a terminal up.  The Ubuntu box with the near-same setup was using 1700+ of the 2gb.

This irritated me so I resolved to wipe the drive and go for Arch.  Now, on a boot without GUI (openbox/tint2/feh btw) the machine is using 41mb!! WOW.  Once I startx and chromium, batterymon, nm-applet, volwheel, a term, and pidgin pop up, it's still only about 140mb.  My machine has never run cooler or smoother.

This is just icing on the cake: My cable, which is rated/charged at 4mb, and was hitting 4.5 on the Ubuntu install, is now clocking 9-10mb on wifi, which is faster than the cable co even offers.  Any ideas how/why?

I got myself a running version of arch, everything works and to be honest it was actually rather easy. I can program a bit(Java, python) and following the installation guide it was rather fun to install arch. I liked that I had control of whatever was happening. I was not seeing some green progress bar slide slowly to 100%. It was also nice to do the 'command version' of my ubuntu installation.

  
Anyways, it is installed, i'm using grub 3 because I like the looks but considering a tiling WM. But my 19"" screen probably won't really allow that. But I'm looking for things to customize on my system, I liked using the terminal but now I got a completely working system.

1364339077.0	1b2nor	Stable Arch-like alternative	bakeonmypie	33	11	64	"I've been running an arch system for about two/three years. I updated last night and when I booted this morning arch complained about not being able to find /dev/sda1 and then dropped me to rootfs recovery prompt, which is about as useful as handing me a wooden spoon (it did wish me good luck though, cheers arch). There were no devices in /dev.

I booted into fallback mode and it said the same thing but about sda3 so I tried systemRescueCD which allowed me to boot up into my system successfully.

Then I tried changing my fstab to use UUID instead of /dev/sd* but that never worked so found a solution online which used mkinitpcio to recompil linux using with chroot and reinstalling udev and the kernel and then pacman complained about signatures and- why am I still using Arch Linux?

I work from home at the moment and my computer is my work machine and not my toy. I'm not saying Arch is a toy OS but I certainly had fun using it! Unfortunately I just don't have the time to manage such a system any more.

My only problem is that I use a simple set up and I can't seem to find anything that will give me the simplicity of Arch:
- I use dwm, xterm and no login manager
- I like systemd
- I use the aur for managing non-standard packages
- the Arch wiki

I'm thinking about moving to Debian but it seems to be very all or nothing:
Stable - outdated, useful new features are ignored (I run the house server on Debian stable)
Unstable - ""pfft you're on your own, we have no idea""

What's a good working os that will allow me to use a simple, useful set up? Debian testing maybe? I don't have time to fiddle about with recompiling my kernel anymore. :(

Edit: So I booted in with my SystemRescueCd today, ran an update and, like magic, it fixed everything. Wat. Still, I think I'm going to move to Debian Wheezy and then update twice a year when I have some free time. Like I said before, I just can't put any more effort into to using/learning Arch.

A lot of them are crunchbang setups but I was also interested to find that there is an archbang distro. I am keen to give it a shot.

Now I've used arch before so I've been through the process of getting my wi-fi and DE up and running as well as filling out the appropriate .conf files. I understand that Archbang makes this process a lot easier.

My main questions are for people who have used both Arch Linux and Archbang:


• Is the install really that much easier?

• How much configuration is needed at install compared to a normal Arch Linux install?

• Are updates still the same? As in, does Pacman -Syu still pull packages from the same repositories or does Archbang maintain software in its own repos?

• Am I just being lazy installing Archbang?

Thank for reading!


*Edit: Thanks for the tips guys. I ended up doing an Arch install with a basic openbox tint2 setup. A bit more mucking around with installing this time without the AIF but the wiki was great which is one of the things I love about arch.

Some details for you:
I'm running KDE
I have installed some font packages (ttf-liberation, ttf-dejavu, and some others)
I tried installing the ttf-win7-fonts AUR package but I get an error that says ""arial.ttf was not found in the build directory and is not a URL.""


Bottom line is this:  I loved the look I had on Ubuntu 10.04 with GNOME 2.  The fonts looked beautiful.  The theme was nice.  About the only thing I changed from the defaults in Ubuntu 10.04 was that I moved the window minimize, maximize and close buttons back to the upper right corner.

Here is a link to a screenshot of what my Ubuntu 10.04 system looked like: http://i.imgur.com/qfegi.png

Here is what my current Arch system looks like: http://i.imgur.com/xZA4Q.png

It looks a lot worse on other websites too.

I'd like to tackle the font issue first, then move on to my other issue which is the default theme in KDE is ugly too.  Any suggestions?

It is a really simple and easy to use script to change the backlight on your screen. It takes 1 argument, and that is the lightness percent you prefer (for example ""light 25"" gives 25% lightness).

It automatically decides which controller to use based on its precision, also it uses sudo where available so you dont have to type 5 extra letters.

I purchased a Lenovo Thinkpad X220 (with DOS preinstalled to avoid the MS tax, pretty cool on Lenovo's part: http://shop.lenovo.com/us/thinkpad-laptops-with-dos.shtml ), and was stupid enough to select ""Thinkpad b/g/n"" as the wireless card, instead of the other option, an Intel one.

Long story short, the current Arch ISO has no drivers for either of the network interfaces this way (ethernet or wireless), which is a pain in the butt. The good news is newer kernel versions have them, so all that's needed to enable both drivers is download one of the Release Engineering snapshots (I went with the latest one, http://releng.archlinux.org/isos/2011.06.10/) and you're set.

Everything works like a charm: graphics, sound, sleep, hibernate, the hardware keys, the touchpad... as usual with Thinkpads, the keyboard is a pleasure to use and the battery (6 cell) lasts a good 6 hours, and all for a pretty damn good price. Heartily recommended as an Arch box.

* Does ArchLinux come with the new KDE 4.4 and ext4?
* I have two partitions /, /home. I need the contents of the latter (~ 70 GB; Can I do this without copying?).
* I need Chromium plus all my stuff on it (bookmarks, history and passwords).

Samba has stumped me. I'm trying to access files on my Windows 7 desktop computer connected to a LAN cable through my Arch netbook connected to wifi. I followed all of the steps listed here:

As well as doing a ton of Googling/troubleshooting for the past 2 hours, but obviously I'm still doing something wrong. When I run ""smbclient //D-PC/Users/Mark/Desktop/Artists -U root"" and enter the password I set I get: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE. I made sure the password I set was right with smbpasswd. It doesn't work when I try the same command above as ""mab"" (my Arch username). 





I've also tried ""sudo mount -t cifs //D-PC/Users/Mark/Desktop/Artists /mnt/windows -o user=Mark,password=abc123,homegroup=HOMEGROUP"" but all I get is: 


mount error: ""could not resolve address for D-PC: unknown error""





I believe everything should be set up on the Windows side of things. The homegroup and name seems fine, and I can see my netbook on the network map, the folder options are fine and homegroup sharing settings, too, so... 





My /etc/samba/smb.conf: 




    GNU nano 2.2.6           File: /etc/samba/smb.conf

Now that i upgraded to gigabit i noticed performance problems with it. With sshfs I get about 8MB/s, with scp i get about 60MB/s. Changing cyphers doesn't help.

So I would like some alternative to sshfs with the same kind of flexibilities, with the speed of nfs.

I don't like nfs, it's rather complicated to setup(given that i have a ton of filesystems on my server, I don't want to export them individually).

So here are my requirements:

* Something easy to setup on the server without having to export each fs manually.
* Something as fast as nfs
* Preferrably something that doesn't require a funky network setup to use(ideally i can just use it over the ssh port). Samba gets disqualified because of that
* Something that supports/translates server side symlinks

sshfs was perfect till now, but that performance problem blocks me from having a lot of stuff in my /home on an sshfs share."	t5_2qrzu	True

This makes one's workflow with multiple monitors a bit more flexible, since you have finer control over what you're seeing. (This has become an absolute *must* since I've added a third monitor.)

Unfortunately, this breaks the EWMH spec in some ways and results in all available pagers being quite confusing. So I've spent the last two days creating a special pager (configurable in Python and supports dynamic workspace management) that will work with Openbox Multihead. (And theoretically, any future window manager that adopts my new atom _NET_VISIBLE_DESKTOPS.)

This pager will **also work with single head users using regular Openbox**. (But not multihead users using regular Openbox.)

Most of my ideas were inspired by Xmonad. Particularly its desktop model, along with the DynamicWorkspaces and Prompt contrib modules.

The following are links to my ""Community Contribution"" threads where the particulars are explained.

* [Pager Multihead](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=124528) --- [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/cnZeq)

Nothing has changed with my router settings or Arch other than the use of Crashplan for local backups.  I discovered that Crashplan can cause inotify watch issues and was receiving ""No space left on device"" errors when running systemctl commands so I greatly increased the maximum inode values.  This has lessened the occurrence of the No space left errors but I am still getting them randomly.  I have since disabled the crashplan backup server in hopes that it was somehow the issues but that did not help either.

To test that it is the desktop when Arch is running I wait until connectivity issues arise and then verify it with my laptop and with a PS3 running Hulu.  Both devices fail to make consistent successful outbound connections.  If I turn off the ethernet connection manually inside Arch, almost instantly connectivity returns to all other devices.

At this point I am completely at a loss and will try any suggestions.  Here is my current PC setup as well as the network situation.  If anything is unclear please yell at me and tell me to fix it.  Any help/suggestions are greatly appreciated.

+ SPI firewall off, all other settings handled by main router

**PC:**

+ Arch / Win 7 dual boot - assigned static IP by the main router

+ Windows and Arch are on separate hard disks

+ Windows can run indefinitely and causes no connectivity issues

Again no issues until about a week ago and I cannot wait to fix this as I only use Windows for gaming so its killing any work from home.

**Update**
[Dmesg](http://pastebin.com/cUiKuFUA) and [journalctl](http://pastebin.com/yyEfZpZY) outputs
  
I have tried enabling and disabling my media server as well as crashplan but they do not seem to help.  I have also now tried pinging both routers from multiple devices and when the desktop shuts down the connections for everyone the packet loss occurs when attempting to reach my main router (Router 1) but the devices tested have no problem reaching the bridge(Router 2)  which is wirelessly connected to the network and hardwired only to the desktop. Thanks again.

**Update 2**

I saw the post concerning the move to netctl and I made the transition and decided the check for updates before a reboot.  Updated systemd and after the reboot I have a much better situation.  I will get occasional drops but it is no longer crippling other devices and is fully functional 90% of the time.  Not the best resolution but something I can live with at the moment as I am rather busy.  Thanks for the suggestions.

**Update 3**

New kernel update came through today and the ~10% packet loss seems to have completely disappeared.  Sorry for no concrete conclusion but things seem to have resumed operating normally."	t5_2qrzu	True

However my PC is feeling pretty slow now and my laptop has been deceased for a few months now.

However I have a couple of worries:

* Will an SSD work fine, and be FAST with Arch? (Pretty sure it will just want to check)
* Will it be possible to use my existing eyefinity setup? (Three monitors with an ATI card)
* Will it be possible to game on three monitors?
* Do you think the Source engine will come to Linux?

I have followed the Unofficial Beginner's Guide and I have finished installing xorg and a wm.
I have taken a few deviations - I have not created three partitions for /boot, /home etc - I have put everything in a single partition. Reason is that I already have multiple partitions containing OS's that I use - ubuntu in my case,. and I didn't want to disturb that too much.
 
There are a few issues that I hope someone can help me with.

1. Arch always boots in readonly mode. I have to remount the partition read-write every time.
2. My fstab only contains only one line for /tmp. There is no reference to Arch's main partition - /dev/sda3 in my case. Is this normal? Should I be running genfstab again?
3. I have to bring up eth0 manually every time I boot. dhcpcd etc. I saw that I could add this to rc.conf, but I have no /etc/rc/conf. Is this normal? Sould I just create one?
4. I installed slim as the login manager. I don't have a good experience with slim on ubuntu - but I didn't know what else to choose from that list (in the wiki). Can anyone suggest any other login manager? I intend to play around with ArchLinux a lot - but the login manager is something that I would like if it ""just worked""
5. I have just finished installing xorg and a wm (awesome) and I was just about to set X to launch automatically. But then I found that I have no inittab. Is this normal? Should I just create /etc/inittab myself? Is there an example file file available anywhere? Is there  way to autogenerate this based on my setup?

thanks.

I looked for reviews of i3 online or any comparisons between the two but couldn't find anything worthwhile. I know that i3 does manual tiling while Xmonad does dynamic, and I played with i3 for a bit the other day and thought I could get used to it, but I was just wondering if any of you have done the same thing, or just could give a review of your experience with i3.

1367210564.0	1dbi8r	Trouble with Dvorak keyboard layout	xkbd	22	6	4	"Hi r/ArchLinux! I am having a bit of a headache trying to set up the keyboard layouts on my machine. I have used the Dvorak keyboard with UK punctuation keyboard layout for a long while now but cannot get it to work at my terminal. After installing Arch I have discovered that there are actually two different variants of the Dvorak UK keymap:

* [Dvorak UK layout with US punctuation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/KB_United_Kingdom_Dvorak.svg)
* [Dvorak UK layout with UK punctuation](http://www.tarind.com/ukdvorak.png)

As luck would have it, the US punctuation version is the only one to exist in ""console""; the dvorak-uk.map.gz in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/dvorak, which I load up with:

    sudo loadkeys dvorak-uk

The above keymap maintains most US punctuation keys with a few minor changes such as adding a sterling symbol. On the other hand, in xorg, the Dvorak UK layout with UK punctuation can be loaded by using:

    setxkbymap gb -variant dvorak

and it brings up the Dvorak UK layout that I normally use perfectly. As far as I am aware, the US punctuation version is not available in xorg, and the UK punctuation version not available in console. This is especially annoying in console as the all important pipe key on a UK keyboard is on a separate key to the left of Z which can't be accessed in US layouts. 

Is there any way I could export my X keymap to a .map file for use in the console? I have searched far and wide for a UK punctuation .map file but have only found a Windows .klc. I never noticed there was another variant in use before as I have only ever used Linux with X11 before installing Arch. I'm lead to believe that xkb composes the keymap on the fly as I can't find an equivalent map file in /usr/share/X11/xkb or any of its subdirectories, for example. I am aware I could go to the troubles of making my own .map file, but knowing that I can use the UK punctuation keymap in X of course makes me think there must be a quicker solution by somehow exporting the keymap from X :) Thanks for reading through all this!

Hello, I'm experiencing an error I find hard to explain... I'm running a fresh 64 bit install of Arch, fully updated. Installed Xorg, Nvidia 313 drivers, KDE, openbox (using as wm inside KDE), skype and netflix-desktop. And of course: Chromium. 

I keep getting random hangs when opening new tabs and sometimes copy-pasting text. When opening tabs it starts to render the tab, but stops 10-20% into the animation. I'm not sure how to explain it any better than that. 

I tried running Chromium in debug mode with no output that seemed related to the issue. I have to kill the processes chromium has spawned to get it to stop completely and to start it again. 

The odd thing about this is I started experiencing this using openbox only a while back ago. Back then I thought it was related to me installing Unity and it's odd *-ubuntu packages and removing it again. I ended up formatting when I didn't find a solution, and it started happening the same day as I reinstalled Arch. I did not back up anything and started with a clean home directory.

Anyone experience anything like this? I'm at a loss here :/

1315235564.0	k5dqf	Arch Unexplainable Issue	Rakmos	23	4	13	"So I am very fond of arch, and the philosophy, but I am running into this same problem continually that I cannot seem to determine the cause of.

The problem occurs when booting from the arch install disk as well as arch itself (post installation).

**Description:**
Since I always do a netinstall, I select my packages and I am off downloading for a good ~30 minutes.  Occasionally, I will come back from the other room to see the monitor turned off (amber light for the power button).  When I hit a key on the keyboard it sometimes will turn the monitor back on, and other times it will not.

To get around the install, I just chose a smaller selection of packages so as to avoid the issue of my monitor never coming back on.  

After installing arch, the same thing happens, but instead I can be in the middle of using my computer.  Again, the monitor power light will go amber with a completely black screen.

I have attempted unplugging and plugging in my keyboard and mouse, in addition to cycling the power on my monitor.  The only thing that I can ever do though is just hit the reset button on my computer.  

I have tried looking in dmesg, as well as several other logs in  /var/logs, but I cannot seem to find the culprit.

Has anyone seen an issue like this in the past??

It is also important to note that occasionally when this happens a fan (not sure which one since I am usually a bit perturbed when it occurs) in my case spins up and just stays running at full blast until I kill the power.

Any help or advice would be much appreciated.

EDIT:  Thanks for the advice!!  The setterm -powerdown 0 -powersave off fixed part of the issue.  It now appears the only time that my screen blacks out is if my graphics card fan spins up and doesn't stop, thereby leading my to believe it is a graphics driver issue.  I will try the proprietary drivers for Nvidia to see if they work any better.

**EDIT 2:**  I would just like to say that my issue has been fully resolved!!  Thanks Arch subreddit, you have been most helpful!!  (It was the open source nvidia drivers that were causing the issues.  Let this be a warning to others with an nvidia card -- and more specifically, an nvidia 9800GTX.)"	t5_2qrzu	True

I am using Ubuntu 8.04 and my laptop works great. However recently I have been encountering issues with out of date software due to the age of my distro ( LTS........). Now that 10.04 is coming I will be upgrading again, however I dont like the direction where Lucid is going style wise and content wise and the idea of changing distro is becoming more and more appealing. I spent last night on the Wiki pages reading up and it does seem daunting but changeling 

I have read that the wiki pages on arch are top quality for any level but I am writing my PhD soon and I don't want to have to spend loads of time fiddling to get everything working perfectly again. My Linux level is ok ( well I dont know) I am comfortable with the command line but I have become overly reliant on the copy paste method of doing stuff from the interwebs, which I feel is holding me back (yet making life easier!) 

So my question is

1: Is arch readily accessible quick to get into a working reliable everyday desktop space?

2: What linux level is recommended to fully exploit Arch over just firing an Ubuntu CD into my drive

Note: I know that by using Arch my linux experience will sky rocket quickly but as I said there is a PhD to be done and that has priority at the moment.

** *EDIT* **  Wow thanks for the support and advice, I am not surprised however this is something that I have come to expect from the Linux community over the years :) 
I am going to give Chakra a shot this weekend, giving up 40gig or so and give it a good run while keeping a stable Ubuntu setup.
Again thanks for the advice it is much appreciated

The Arch wiki says using ""pacman -S $(pacman -Ssq ttf)"" will install all True-type fonts. Everything downloaded fine but when it began to install I saw a massive spike.

This time I tried the command again same problem. All my RAM was used up and now my swap was filling up. It seemed to just keep increases so I canceled. Even after canceling my computer was still using about 3.5GB of RAM and 2GB of swap space so I rebooted again. Any ideas?

**Edit:** I concluded that is it has something to do with ""Updating font cache... done"" Some fonts do that and some don't. For that fonts that don't, they install fast with no memory spike.

**Edit-2:** Now I think this is a MATE problem. The program ""mate-settings-daemon"" is where all the memory is going. The fix is just to disable X and all the memory goes back to normal.

1364069416.0	1avj6w	Best Possible Audio Quality 	GoPuer	21	4	11	"I'm a little confused as to how exactly to achieve the best possible audio quality with my current setup. I'm currently running the latest version of Arch Linux on my Acer AO722-BZ197. It's a netbook, so the default sound card is pretty bad, but almost my entire library of music is FLAC and I do happen to own a decent pair of headphones (Shure SRH 840s). I've read up on the subject, but I'm a little confused on a few points.





 In my /etc/asound.conf and my ~/.asoundrc I have the ""defaults.pcm.rate_converter"" set to ""samplerate_best,"" but I'm a little confused as to how that interacts with my preferred music player (DeadBeef). Several people have said that I should disable ALSA resampling through DeadBeef as well as disable the Resampler (Secret Rabbit Code), but wouldn't that disable the ""samplerate_best"" part of ALSA, too? I'm a little confused as to how the two interact. 






Also, I mentioned above that my netbook's soundcard is nothing special (I believe it just supports 48000), but I listen to quite a bit of vinyl rips which is in 96000. If I have resampling on, will it resample all of my music to 48000? From what I've read, the way I understand it, having the ""sampelrate_best"" will resample everything to 48000hz, and for most people who listen to CD rips (in 44100) that's fine, but will it negatively affect the sound quality of my vinyl rips? Or will it not matter since my sound card doesn't support 96000hz anyway? 






Lastly, I don't think I've changed anything else except for the /etc/asound.conf. Are there any other settings I could change for better audio quality?

I had just updated (-Syu) so I figured that the update must have broken something. I checked the daemons list and indeed lxdm was listed as loaded but failed. I tried restarting manually using
   
    sudo systemctl start lxdm.service

I was going to install another dm but then I realized the machine wasn't connected to the internet.  I tried using nmcli and wifi-menu to connect but no luck. When I tried iwconfig the only response was 

    lo: no wireless interface
I tried using wireless but even ifconfig only turns up lo

    lspci | grep net
turns up both my wireless and wired networking cards but the os seems to have forgotten they exist . Any suggestions?
I could just make a new install medium, boot it and arch-chroot in to fix it but I'm not sure what I could do besides installing a new dm, and that wouldn't fix the network problem.

So I have two different Samsung printers on two different machines running Arch (both fully up to date). The models are ML-1710 and ML-1630.

Now for some reason, when I print to them (using CUPS to host them) they will successfully print one job... and then not anymore again until I manually restart the printer or the daemon.

This literally only happens to me with Samsung printers. I've had success with both Epson and Lexmark printers... just not Samsung.

Is there something special I need to do to make Samsung printers work? I've found bug reports about the issue, but they're several years old and were marked as 'fixed'... which I guess they really aren't.

Start up Gnome, look in **System Settings**, **Brightness and Lock**, if you have that set to **Dim screen to save power**, and **Turn screen off when inactive for** (my case 10mins)

Problem is, the screen never switches off. After firing up the multitail log on */var/log/errors.log* I get this line:

    mklabel msdos

    quit

Is this an okay way to go about this, and/or is there a way to do this with fdisk or gdisk?

**Two:** When creating the partition Windows will be on, what partition type should I choose? I went with 07 (NTFS), but I'm wondering if this was correct and also whether I could just leave the space blank instead of creating a specific partition.

**Three:** The GRUB page on the Arch wiki has an example entry for Windows, but it's for XP. Will the same entry work for W7? It is as follows:

    # (2) Windows XP

    menuentry ""Windows XP"" {

      set root=""(hd0,3)""

      chainloader +1

    }

Also, is that first line a comment, and if so, can I delete it?

Thanks for helping out!

EDIT: After finishing the Windows installation, it appears to have overwritten GRUB somehow so that it can't be accessed. Is there a way to fix this?

**BIG EDIT:** Got everything working. Here's the steps I had to take, in case anyone stumbles upon this post in the future:

1. Convert GPT disk to MBR. I did this with the Arch CD, by running ""parted /dev/sda"", and in parted, running ""mklabel msdos"" and answering ""yes"" to the question about whether the disk was GPT.

2. Create partition scheme with cfdisk. I created a 70GB partition, then a 15GB bootable partition, and then filled the rest of the space with another partition. I then delete the first partition to make it unallocated space.

3. After partitioning, shutting down and booting the Windows disk, then installing Windows in the 70GB unallocated space

4. After installing Windows, booting the Arch disk and installing on the two partitions I made earlier (i.e. checking their numbers in cfdisk, formatting both as ext4, mounting the first [/dev/sda3] on /mnt and the second [sda4] on /mnt/home.

5. Before running ""grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"" at the end of the install, finding the Windows system reserved partition in cfdisk and noting its number (in my case, /dev/sda1). Then creating a file ""/boot/grub/custom.cfg"" and adding the entry I pasted above (minus the commented line, and replacing 0,3 with 0,1 to match my partition scheme."	t5_2qrzu	True

in the wiki article
[systemd/User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User). However the
information is spotty and I have run into problems. For now it seems as
`systemd --user is` launched as my user, daoo. But it does not start xorg or any of
the services I have placed in `~/.config/systemd/user/*.target/`.

I noticed I could switch to tty2, login and start the services (`systemctl
--user start xorg wm.target stuff.target`). Though my `~/.zprofile` is not
executed and since I use it to modify `$PATH` some other programs fail later.
However I noticed it is possible to set `$PATH` using xmonad.service, though
this does nothing for SSH sessions. Which is the preferable way to change
`$PATH`?

However, I'm somewhat new to linux. I've used Ubuntu before and have fiddled with terminal, but I've never stuck with it because I feel like Ubuntu is bloated and slow. I've always had issues with lag and unresponsiveness, even on my mid level desktop.

That being said, I naturally gravitated towards Arch Linux. Who wouldn't want to cut down on stuff you don't use, and build your OS to your own standards?

I am however, a bit worried I won't have the know how to do this. I know I could just download someone else's .iso that's similar to what I want... but that defeats the purpose of having my own setup and learning how to do all of this.

 I figured that I might be able to come here for a couple of pointers and tips; stuff I should be ready for when I start this.

So...

* How much do I actually have to know about terminal commands/linux to do this?
* I'm looking for a lightweight distro (will end up using on RPi and my Chromebook), what Window Manager/Desktop Environment combinations should I avoid?
* What are the most important choices I'll have to make?
* How stable are Arch Linux builds (used to weird internet issues, freezing, etc on Ubuntu)?

*""The use of noatime, nodiratime or relatime can help disk performance for ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystems. Linux by default keeps a record (writes to the disk) every times it reads from the disk atime. This was more purposeful when Linux was being used for servers; it doesn't have much value for desktop use. The worst thing about the default atime option is that even reading a file from the page cache (reading from memory instead of the disk) will still result in a disk write! Using the noatime option fully disables writing file access times to the disk every time you read a file. This works well for almost all applications, except for a rare few like Mutt that need the such information.""*

 I checked my fstab and saw that this is not on by default so I was wondering whether I could enable it for my root, home and the 2nd internal drive partition without any side effects. Is that considered safe practice? 

PS : I managed to mount my second internal drive by using the options *defaults,user*. Up to now, what I had to do was go to nautilus and enter my root password in order to mount the drive. Are the options I put in the fstab correct? I read somethings about noexec, nouid which are implied in the defaults option, but I dont really know what they mean, and I also read that the *user* option overrides them.

1313202689.0	jhdco	A complaint in the hope of a solution	sublimepua	24	9	16	"On May of 2011, an update to X.Org was pushed into core that made working with a netbook very difficult. I have an acer with 250gb HDD, 2GB RAM and a 1.6Ghz processor. For all but the most taxing tasks, it it quite snappy. The obvious limitation is the screen. Cue linux. There is a feature of X.Org that allows one to scale the screen upwards, to have a higher virtual resolution. I've used it to artificially upgrade video performance on laptops, desktops, and netbooks for a while. 
The syntax is as follows: 
xrandr --output [screen name] --mode [current resolution] --scale [decimal of scaling percentage] --panning [new resolution]
For my 1024x600 screen, it is
xrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1024x600 --scale 1.25x1.25 --panning 1280x750


Arch was for a long time my favorite linux distribution. The update in march made panning not work any more; the mouse becomes trapped within a border the size of the original screen, situated in the upper left.  When this update was pushed through, the arch forums were ablaze with help threads looking for an answer. I was the only one motivated enough to post a bug report. Despite the attention surrounding it, and the fact that it makes netbooks very hard to use, it was flagged as a low priority and ignored by the X.Org package maintainer. 

https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/24274

I did some testing to confirm it was not an intel driver update, but indeed the xorg package, and it is. I emailed the package maintainer, submitted a bug report, annoyed some devs on the freenode channel, and basically got referred from one dev to another as they all told me it wasn't their area of expertise and that I should fix it myself. Despite an attempt at teaching myself the entire X.org subsystem, I came up empty handed.The attention died down. I accepted that to use my netbook, I would have to switch distributions. I have been running gentoo with their X.Org updated to the same version and its working fine. It must be some patching done by the arch devs itself that broke it. Yes, this issue is that important to some of us that we will leave arch rather than have our computers crippled. Nowadays, all I hear about it is a tri-weekly comment on the bug report confirming it and asking why it has not been fixed. 

Why hasn't it been fixed? I will try to fix it again, if any devs familiar with X.Org would be willing to help me. I miss arch. I miss the speed. I miss the simplicity. I miss the adherence to the philosophy of simplicity. May I ask that the people who maintain the package at least try to fix it?

EDIT: Does anyone know how I can contact Jan de Groot? He seems to be the real maintainer. 

EDIT 2: It appears that this problem was first noticed around 5.14.11

I'm currently running the latest version of Arch on a Acer Aspire One 722-BZ197 Netbook and a Crucial M4 64GB (latest firmware) Solid State Drive. I'm thinking of doing a clean reinstall for separate reasons, but before I started I wanted to make sure I understood how to partition my SSD correctly. 





Here's my ""df -h"" currently:

    Filesystem    Size    Used     Avail     Use%      Mounted on
    /dev/sda1      16G    6.2G      8.7G      42%         /
    dev                1.8G    0          1.8G       0%         /dev
    run                1.8G    584K     1.8G      1%           /run

I don't remember exactly how or why I partitioned it that way or if it's even correct, but that's what I got out of all of the reddit posts/wiki guides last time I did a clean install. And if I recall correctly I should have all of the flags properly set up and whatnot. 





Is there anything I should change this time around? As far as storage and partition sizes are concerned, I don't store a whole lot of stuff on my SSD, I have an external HDD for that, so are there any things I could do to make the system more efficient? It is a netbook so I do use the hibernate feature quite frequently, does that affect how I should partition the swap? I guess I'm still a little lost when it comes to this kind of stuff.

edit: whoops, should by ""installation process"" in the title.  sorry :(
edit 2: problem mostly solved, I'm now wondering how to figure out why ""fallback"" mode works for grub, and what I need to modify to get the normal boot to work

edit3:  Solved! thanks!

I've gotten so far with dual-booting ArchLinux, I'm so close, I just have trouble booting.  Here's what I've done so far:

* I followed the Macbook wiki and general install guide until the reboot section
* Within the guide, I'm choosing to do EFI boot, and I'm creating the extra HFS+ partition to install grub on (so I can just use the Mac bootloader)
* I installed grub, and I did the method that puts the config on the efi partition (which is not sda1, it's the new hfs+ partition that has the SystemVersion)
* Did the default config for mkinitcpio, plus keyboard

Now things looked good, and I can see the volume when I hold ALT when booting.  However, I could not boot from the volume at first, it would just keep sending me to Mac. I tried:

* I folder blessed the new boot volume and the grub efi
* I did not mount bless or use the --setBoot option

Now, when I boot from the volume I get the grub2 boot prompt! hooray!

However, I immediately get the error that it ""cannot find the boot device 'UUID-&lt;giant uuid string&gt;"".  It also complains that it can't fsck it, and then enters an emergency shell.  Any ideas?

edit updated info:

The uuid matches sda6, and I'm also getting the messages:
&gt;I8041: No controller found

&gt;HC with no IRQ

&gt;Check BIOS/PCI setup!

I'm not using encryption, I have these partitions:

* sda1 - mac efi
* sda2 - osx
* sda3 - arch boot efi (hfs+)
* sda4 - /boot (ext4)
* sda5 - swap
* sda6 - / (ext4)
* sda7 - /home (ext4)

I've been using Ubuntu for the past few years, mainly out of laziness, but I had some spare time over the holiday season and wanted to try something new.

Is it common to use ABS? What separates it from using deb-src in Ubuntu? Is it comparable to Gentoo's emerge? Do most of you run the default kernel, or do you compile your own?

Now that I have a running system, can you give me any hints that will demonstrate the superiority of Arch? I liked building the system from the ground up, but can you give me a better idea of what sets it apart from an Ubuntu/Debian netinstall?

I guess a major advantage might be the rolling release nature of Arch, but when I was using Gentoo some years ago, I encountered a level of dependency hell that still sends shivers down my spine. Is this a common occurrence once you've installed too many packages from the AUR?

I plan on enjoying Arch during my holidays, but I'm not sure if I'll stick with Ubuntu when I get back to school and my workstation, perhaps you can help me take full advantage to my hardware and this interesting software stack.

I'm having a problem with a common application from the repositories (it's not important for this what the app is, I'm just using it as a general example). It was working previously, and is still working partially. When it stopped working, the first thing I did was google the output to see if anyone had had similar problems and found a solution. The top twenty or so I found either weren't the same problem, or similar but had no answers. What I googled couldn't get much more general, either.

Next, I tried IRC a few times. I was polite, explained my problem, what I had tried, and posted the relevant command line errors. Pretty much got ignored. Ok, I get that the right people aren't always in there.

So I tried the Arch forums. Posted, lots of detail beyond just the errors. No answers there either.

I read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/tjjwr/archlinux_a_howto_in_troubleshooting_for_newcomers/) a while ago, and it really is kind of inspiring.

    # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

&gt; NOTE: The file path is /boot/grub/grub.cfg, NOT /boot/grub/i386-pc/grub.cfg

        }


**:: security ::**

&gt; If you want to secure GRUB2 so it is not possible for anyone to change boot parameters or use the command line, you can add a user/password combination to GRUB2's configuration files. To do this, run the command grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2. Enter a password and confirm it.

    # grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

        the output will look like this ;;
                PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.C8ABD3E93C4DFC83138B0C7A3D719BC650E6234310DA069E6FDB0DD4156313DA3D0D9BFFC2846C21D5A2DDA515114CF6378F8A064C94198D0618E70D23717E82.509BFA8A4217EAD0B33C87432524C0B6B64B34FBAD22D3E6E6874D9B101996C5F98AB1746FE7C7199147ECF4ABD8661C222EEEDB7D14A843261FFF2C07B1269A

&gt; Then, add the following to **/etc/grub.d/00_header**:

        cat &lt;&lt; EOF
        
        set superusers=""username""
        password_pbkdf2 username &lt;password&gt;
        
        EOF

&gt; where &lt;password&gt; is the string generated by grub-mkpasswd_pbkdf2.
&gt; Regenerate your configuration file. Your GRUB2 command line, boot parameters and all boot entries are now protected.
&gt; This can be relaxed and further customized with more users as described in the ""Security"" part of the GRUB manual.

                mine looked like so ;;

                        cat &lt;&lt; EOF

1318671105.0	ld155	Total Linux noob diving headfirst into one of the most difficult distributions. My ongoing story.	Stahrk	20	7	35	"Day 1: Decide to finally get around to learning Linux. Install Ubuntu 11.04 alongside Win7. Things go swimmingly. Some issues, but they're resolved with a bit of googling.

Day 2: Ubuntu updates to 11.10, removing any shred of dignity they had left regarding Unity and GNOME, and jump on the idiot Apple bandwagon. I blanch, and then boot back into Windows, likely never to touch Ubuntu again.

Day 3: Reinvigorated by the stream of hate for Ubuntu on the forums, I decide to try a different distro. 'Something that will let me learn from the ground up' I say to myself. Thus, Arch Linux finds itself onto a bootable CD.

Night 3: Holy shit.

Day 4: Managed to complete an install of Arch on my laptop. Several issues arose before this was successful.

1. I could not pick packages, because I had opted to manually partition the drives (and was reasonably successful), but Arch didn't like that. Instead, I had to let it auto-configure, though I got it close enough to my specs that I'm okay with it.

2. My wireless card was not connecting from the get-go. Had to find documentation on how to associate it with the network and allow it to connect. Finally succeeded.

3. After finishing the installation successfully, realized that I had forgotten to install the wireless-tools package that was so conveniently located on the bootable disk, but hadn't been installed onto my drives. Forced to reinstall with aforementioned package. Figured the other stuff can wait (though I tossed the sudo package in there because it looked familiar)

Night 4: The learning experience continues. Glad I have my desktop while I make my laptop explode with this. 

Update 1 - Night 4: Currently baffled by the fact that my wireless card unassociates itself with the network on every reboot. Have to figure out a way to fix that. Also unable to create or write to files without being logged in as root. - FIXED

Update 2 - Night 5: Fixed my wireless, but was then convinced to change to wicd rather than the default network manager. Everything went to shit. I can still connect just fine with dhcpcd wlan0, but I don't actually get access to the internet, despite registering an IP address. On top of that, wicd just hangs at ""Validating authentication"", despite all entered information being correct. Urk. - FIXED

Update 3 - Night 5: We have a working GNOME desktop environment, functional internet, and firefox installed. Hurrah me! Now to tweak and tweak and tweak.

Update 4 - Night 6: Many tweaks completed. Currently baffled by both conky and themes for gnome. I can't seem to change the window or title bar colors in any way, nor am I able to make conky transparent. Massive pain in the rear.

1314241748.0	jtmnk	Techniques for using (tiling) window managers efficiently	stack_underflow	17	3	28	"I've been using awesome for about half a year now and recently started using dwm as a backup (specifically for some program that doesn't behave correctly in awesome).

One of the first things I had noticed was dwm by default didn't have any function that allowed you to move to the left or right of the currently selected tag. In awesome, this is done with the mod+{left,right} arrows (which I've remapped to mod+{h,l} to feel more vim like, and since I never resize windows).

When I went on dwm's irc channel to inquire about this, I got flamed for not understanding how tags works (which I don't blame them for, since I never actually read up on how to use them, and just learned by messing around). Someone then pointed me towards a link that sort of explained how they should be used.

After reading it I understood why 'moving to the left or right' of a tag didn't really make sense (but I still ended up finding a patch for it since I find it an easy way to navigate between tagged windows).

This got me thinking about how people use tags in tiling window managers. Is it more efficient to treat them as labeled workspaces? For example, having ' term | vim | web | media | ... ', and having certain programs or activities bound to those tags? I've found that this method, while more organized, kind of restricts how dynamic your workflow can be. On the other hand, leaving the tags unlabeled and deciding on the fly what a tag should be used for seems less restrictive and allows you to further divide a task and then pull the sub-divisions into focus when you need them. Although I do find it convenient to set certain programs to open under a predetermined tag, so that they doesn't distract me if I happened to run them while in the middle of something else.

after 4 hours last night of trying desperately everything I could find or think of to get my machine connected to the internet so I could download packages, I gave up and installed Kubuntu. Even that was a hassle, as I had to mount the USB-install disk in /cdrom/, and add it as a repository before I could get the broadcom card working of it (11 dependencies, and no internet to get them off of, it wasn't a matter of simply installing a .deb file).

1. Is there a way to make module-role-ducking just duck everything else but the application that triggered the ducking?

2. Is there a way to set a global default role for any application which does not specify one?

3. If 1 and 2 are negative, how to manually set the role of an application at launch-time?

Ducking seems like an interesting feature, but roles are so fucked up usability-wise (if you're using an exotic application (not that I would qualify mplayer as exotic), or if you're not using .desktop files, then too bad for you!), I am starting to give up.

1370215069.0	1fjoau	Can't stop fsck from running on root partition on every boot.	hacker_sam	16	4	13	"Ok, so after looking around for a while, I'm at a loss. Recently, my boots would hang every time due to an fsck on my root partition giving a 'WRITE SAME failed' error and would sit there for hours manually zeroing. Couldn't find any solutions for this, so I tried something else.
I converted my root partition to btrfs because it likes to take care of itself and doesn't want fsck run on it. On boot, fsck still tries to run but gives me the error message 'fsck.btrfs not found'. I know there isn't a fsck option for btrfs but I can not figure out how to stop fsck from running on boot every time.

After the filesystem conversion to btrfs I did recreate by /etc/fstab and grub.cfg. I know the last entry in the /etc/fstab columns should be set to 0 to tell fsck to ignore it. I've had this set to 0 every time and fsck still runs.

1367705088.0	1dp7xh	Advice transferring Arch to new SSD, using in addition to old HDD	Esoteric_Wombat	16	4	6	"I'm getting a 30gb mSATA drive for my T530. I would like to use this as my primary OS drive, and then use the old hard drive as a backup of the ssd, and as storage for music, videos, and other media.
  
My current hard drive configuration has 3 partitions- first the root partition, then swap, then home.
  
The plan is to have a root (including home) and a swap partition on the SSD, and transfer everything from the old root partition to the new. Transfer all the dot files from the old /home to the new one, and mount the old /home to the new /home as something like /files. Now everything system related is on the ssd, and all the large media files are on the HDD, but accessible from home.
  
On the HDD I want to delete the old swap partition, enlarge the old root partition, and turn that into a backup for the SSD. I don't really know the best way to set up a backup like that.
  
Questions:  
Is this a good way to go about transferring to the SSD? I'm pretty sure I can just transfer files over, and then mark the new partition as bootable.  
Is there a particular program I should consider for transferring files?  
What would be a good way to configure the backup partition/backup process?  
I have read through the SSD wiki page. The SSD has TRIM support, so I'll enable that. I realize minimizing read/write is a concern, so I'll reduce swappiness for the swap partition, but apart from that, is there anything I really have to do? If the SSD dies after 3 or 4 years from overuse then I'll be fine with buying a new one. Doing things like putting /var on the HDD seems needlessly complicated.

Just about 5184 hours. Update the drives firmware from the website. I just posted about this on the arch forms as well. If you don't have an M4,good luck.


I'm having a problem and I'm not quite sure what's wrong because this has never happened before... 





So I just reinstalled Arch Linux. Clean install, latest install media and whatnot. Followed all of the directions on the wiki, made sure everything was partitioned correctly and aligned (I'm on an SSD) and all that. Set up my system and everything seemed to be working great! but I've noticed that after maybe ~20 minutes my system will go into read only mode and I'm not sure why. For example, when I try and do ""sudo pacman -Syu"" I get ""sudo: unable to open /var/db/sudo/mab/2: Read-only file system"" and ""error: no usable package repositories configured."" Can't copy or move or edit any files at all. Completely read only. 





I'm not sure what the problem is, but I figure it has something to do with my drive setup. I haven't configured copy paste from terminal yet, but I set up my system so to have a 1007kb boot partition, 16G root partition, 8G SWAP, and 35G home partition. I followed all of the wiki directions when using cgdisk and everything should be properly aligned in 2048 blocks (sic?) 




As for my /etc/fstab... I currently have /dev/sda1 (root) with ""rw,noatime,discard,data=ordered"" and ""0 1."" For /dev/sda3 (home) I have the same options but ""0 2."" Both are ext4 and mounted in the right places. I mentioned above that I'm using an SSD, which is why I have the discard and noatime flags, but I was having the same read only problem with the default fstab settings, too (relatime and no discard, iirc). 





I apologize if this doesn't help very much, but I'm a little confused as to what the problem is. Right now if I restart the computer I starts in read and write mode, but after a short while it will lock into read only mode. Again, I'm not sure what the problem is (which is why I'm asking here), so if you need any information I'll be more then happy to provide it.

Squidamatron	18	6	34	"At the moment I've got an install of Arch on my typical BIOS based motherboard [XFX 750i], but I also dual boot with Windows 7 and the Q6600 just doesn't cut it for some games any more. So I seek an upgrade.

Anyways, I've read through the Arch wiki on UEFI and the GRUB2 installation process with UEFI and I feel fairly comfortable with the instructions that it gives. Though there is a difference between reading and actual application. That said, I've never done this before or dealt with UEFI and Linux.

So, has anyone moved a HDD with some distribution installed from a typical BIOS motherboard to a UEFI motherboard? And what tips/additional information do you have? Or just any additional information that could help would be nice!

Some additional info/questions:

Following the Arch Wiki a couple years ago, my /boot is on its own partition. I recall reading that this could cause some issues if it was too small. Is this true? At the moment, by /boot is 99MB in size according to df -h. I'm not sure what compelled me to make it that size...

I'm **not** currently using GRUB2. I'm using the older GRUB [pacman shows 0.97-21]

The wiki mentioned kernel config options. Would these go in mkinitcpio.conf? I can only assume I'd need to chroot in and recompile the kernel with these options or do it before moving the HDD, right?

I'm looking at buying [MSI's Z77A-GD65](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130643) if it makes any difference.

The wiki was great, I learned more in one night than I had in a year of using ubuntu and then mint and I almost have a machine configured exactly as I want! (with multilib stuff I have needed/wanted but couldn't have before to boot!)

So I installed nautilus, got it configured the way I wanted. Happy days! then I went to browse my network:/// and...poop. it fails saying it doesn't know how to handle ""network:///"". So I googled and I'm told to install samba, gvfs...

yet, nope not working. 

Any suggestions of where I could look for more info, I'm (reasonably) getting a ton of Ubuntu answers which don't really apply. A straight up solution would also be awesome as well. If you need me to run output commands to check something just say.

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT:** gvfs-smb has been installed. gnome-vfs has been installed. A quick google search suggested the same, but it did not help =/

I just noticed I can't even access the trash in nautilus.

1307912608.0	hxzos	A follow up to introducing my friends to archlinux.		23	12	52	"It was, quite honestly, a failure. And I am not sure why. They installed ArchBang so it wasn't that they couldn't get through the install. I think it's just that they are not Linux users. They never would go out of their way to learn things themselves, they were always looking for the answer. Or they would just put it off until they forgot about it.

Video games also played a part. They weren't willing to give up playing video games. They did dual boot their computers, but from what I've seen they only boot into Windows because it's more convenient for them. 

Another thing that I noticed was just the lack of interest. I think they liked the idea of being Linux users more than they actually wanted to learn about it.

I was more than willing to help them out when they really needed it. But I was pretty short with them when they would ask something trivial. I would generally tell them to figure it out. From my experience that has been the best way to learn. That being said, I was more than willing to sit around with them and play around with things. 

I feel like I have failed the Linux community.

 Do you think this is just their personality? Or do you think that I did something wrong in the way the I approached it? Or do you think that I just chose the wrong distribution? Or maybe because we're 18 and they're just not ready to more to Linux?

1375383135.0	1jifoz	Get your Asus laptop display brightness keys working natively	qwerty12_1	13	3	6	"In Linux, my N55SL's (Intel Sandy Bridge with its HD 3000 driving the display) brightness keys work, but the brightness level that they set is not synchronized with Linux. So, if I use Fn+F5 to lower my brightness, my brightness will indeed lower, but both GNOME's Power Control Center applet and KDE's Battery Plasmoid do not change to reflect the new brightness level and this causes oddities when the DE attempts to change the brightness. 

I tried the usual fixes (setting `acpi_osi` etc. and the ones listed [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_Graphics#Backlight_not_fully_adjusting.2C_or_adjusting_at_all_after_resume) to no avail), until I realised asus-laptop - the kernel driver that listens for ASUS hotkey events - was not getting the [keycodes it expected](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c#L135).

I worked around this by making my DSDT send the keycodes that asus-laptop likes to see.

1. Obtain your current DSDT table: `cp /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT ./DSDT.dat`

2. Install `acpica` from the AUR. The version in there is out of date: you may want to change the version to 20130725 which is, as of writing, the latest version.

3. Use iasl to decompile the table: `iasl -d DSDT.dat`

4. Open up the resulting DSDT.dsl file with your favourite text editor and locate methods _Q0E ([original](http://slexy.org/view/s2b65dWp2a)) which is called when you press Fn+Display Brightness Down and _Q0F ([original](http://slexy.org/view/s2I8QPvMfw)) which is called on Fn+Brightness Up.

5.  I changed the methods to these:

        Method (_Q0E, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Qxx: EC Query
        {
            //The If (LGreaterEqual (OSFG, OSVT)) condition and its section was removed completely as that code is intended for Windows Vista and above
            If (ATKP) //Hotkey driver attached
            {
                \_SB.ATKD.IANE (0x20) //Send 0x20 keypress
            }

            Return (One)
        }


        Method (_Q0F, 0, NotSerialized)  // _Qxx: EC Query
        {
            If (ATKP)
            {
                \_SB.ATKD.IANE (0x2F)
            }

            Return (One)
        }

6. You may need to fix some errors in your DSDT. Thankfully, the only errors I get are that `pnp0c14` should be `PNP0C14`.

7. Compile the new dsdt: `iasl DSDT.dsl`

8. If it all went well, you should see a DSDT.aml in your current directory. The ArchWiki has very good instructions on how to load your custom DSDT table every time Arch starts: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DSDT#Loading_at_runtime

9. After rebooting, if it went well you should see your DE's brightness notification show up when you press your brighness keys.

The downside to this is that you can't use your brightness keys to set the brighness in a console any more, but I pretty much spend all my time in X anyway.

Hi,

I've recently been trying to install Arch Linux alongside Windows 8 on my laptop with a UEFI motherboard, but I've run into a few problems.

To start with I formatted a USB drive, copied the files from the latest .iso into it and booted it. I just get the error ""No loader found. Configuration files in \loader\entries\*.conf are needed."" The same error appears if I try and boot from a DVD. After some googling, it turns out this is an error that sometimes occurs with gummiboot on UEFI systems, and the fix suggested was to use rEFInd instead.

I followed the instructions to set up rEFInd, and this time when I booted, I was actually presented with a boot menu and the option to boot Arch Linux. And it does indeed start to boot, but then this is what I get:

It gets stuck in that loop indefinitely and doesn't let me into any prompt. Apparently there's a common ""30 second"" error with /dev/disk/by-label if the USB drive is labelled incorrectly, but my error is slightly different (I couldn't find it on google) and my drive seems to be labelled correctly (ARCH_201302).

I was advised to try [booting the ISO from RAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Installation_Media#Boot_the_entire_ISO_from_RAM), but after following the steps in the above guide, I couldn't get my USB drive to boot at all. After some more googling, I find out that the current release of syslinux (used in the aforementioned guide) doesn't support UEFI. But the latest release candidate does. Except they don't offer a download for binaries, and for the life of me, after lots of stuffing around and frying my brain I cannot figure out how to build the Makefiles in Windows. I can't guarantee that I'd be able boot with the latest syslinux binaries anyway.

Basically I'm wondering if anyone has any idea on how I should proceed here, as I've run out of options that I know of. I'm also having a hard time finding any other instances of my problems on google.

If it helps, my specifications are:

&gt;ASUS F501a laptop

&gt;BIOS: X501a1.211

&gt;Processor: Intel Pentium B970, 2.3GHz

&gt;RAM: 4GB

&gt;HDD: 500GB

&gt;(Came with) Windows 8 64-bit 6.2, build 9200

&gt;And yes, I've disabled Secureboot.

Any ideas would be really appreciated. As you can probably tell, this is the first time I've tried to install Arch, and I'm totally stuck."	t5_2qrzu	True

I've looked on the Arch wiki and I'm not sure if using one of the [full backup](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backup_Programs#Non-incremental_backups) programs or simply [using DD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disk_Cloning) would be the best solution.

It's my understanding that I do following:

1) Graceful shutdown of the server:
    shutdown -h now

2) Pull the stick out, plug it into the ubuntu machine

3) I'm assuming it will automount

4) Then, I need to type some commands to fully back it up - filesystem is ext3 so not sure if that factors into it.

1352560165.0	12yqh0	A couple of annoying issues I can't seem to resolve (battery and networking related)	Captain_Nubsy	15	4	17	"I have my laptop dual booted with Windows 7 and Arch. I love Arch. I haven't used Windows on this in some time. However, there are a few things I can't figure out and they make using the system a challenge at times.


The first is battery life. I'm using a brand new Thinkpad W530 with a 9 cell battery. I'm lucky if I get 2-3hrs of battery use. As a matter of fact, I make sure it's charged up before I go to bed. In the morning, I get up, and before I go to class, I check up on what I missed overnight. In ~40min - 1hr of just internet (FB, Twitter, baseball blogs, etc), the battery percentage goes from ~97% to somewhere in the 70's. To me that seems very excessive. To the point where when I'm on campus, I try to sit next to an outlet because I don't want to risk it.

I'm using Gnome3 for my desktop. I also have laptop-mode-tools installed and that's configured except for the screen dimming because I usually do that myself anyway. I also have in my grub line:

    pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 

but that seems to have done nothing. On Powertop, all the tunables except VM writeback is listed as good, and yet I'm still getting a discharge rate of nearly 20W.

Is there anything else I can change that will make this last like it should? The thing is, I like my comforts. I like my DE, and I like being able to use the screen backlight. So going graphic-less or turning the light off isn't a great suggestion.

The second problem is with networking. The thing is, it's intermittent. When I'm home, no problems. On the train, I have no problems. However, at school, I can't seem to stay connected to the network for more than a few moments. Now, our network isn't known for being the best, but all of my friends (on Windows) stay connected fine. 

This one is really frustrating, and I just don't get it. I'm not sure what other information may be needed to figure this one out, so let me know and I'll provide what I can.

1318175994.0	l62wo	So close... yet so far away. Problems with Arch installation on a Mac	fosskers	15	2	57	"Hello fine, handsome people. I ask for help quite humbly. I have been at this for twelve hours, and have finally thrown in the proverbial towel.

I am trying to install Arch alongside OSX on my macbook. Was a Mint user before this, and had good experiences, but I've been thinking about the switch to Arch for a while now.

I have read *everything* there is to be read about this process, yet Arch still doesn't want to behave. Or rather, GRUB does not. I've been through the install about 10 times, and tried just about everything, but attempting to load Arch through refit (and then through grub) just hasn't worked. I also had to hack the grub install because:

* On the selection screen to choose the partition to place grub in, I was *only* given the choice of /dev/sda, which every guide said not to do. My partitions did not show up on this screen, as I know they're supposed to.

I only have three partitions:

* sda1: Unique mac thing (Fat32)

* sda2: Main OSX partition (HST+ or whatever)

* sda3: Area for linux (ext4)


I stopped bothering with a swap after nothing was working. Basically two things are happening:

* GRUB doesn't install the way it's supposed to, from within the Arch installer.

* After hacking an install and getting apparent ""success"" Arch still doesn't load. Either I get nothing but a GRUB prompt, or a failure saying No such partition. I tried once to turn my back on the guide and install grub to /dev/sda, at which point I got farther into a boot than before, but in the end it complained /dev/sda3 couldn't be found. Wonderful.


Please, what is going on here? I just want to be one of the cool kids.

EDIT: I have woken up! A good sleep refilled my patience meter. Time to check the comments.

EDIT2: Anyone willing to skype with me through the install? (I've got two computers)

EDIT3: Going to try making a separate partition for /boot (ext2), get grub in there, put arch in as ext4, then see what happens.

**Results of EDIT3** Choosing ""Boot to Linux"" in refit seems successful at first, and I see ""Loading stage 2..."", but then it just drops into a GRUB shell, giving me nothing but ""grub&gt;"" to work with. Is there a way to proceed from here?

EDIT4: **GRUB LIVES!**

Now I just need to convince grub that /dev/sda3 actually exists...

EDIT5: Going to bed for now. It was a very Archy weekend. (I'm so close...)

I've been using Ubuntu for over a year and today I decided to install Arch Linux with Gnome 3. I really like Arch, but I'm outraged because of Gnome 3... I just can't stand the fact that the only way to customize it is by using gnome-tweak-tool, dconf-editor or by these few poor Gnome Shell extensions.

I'm thinking about installing xfce, but I've got a few requirements and I don't know if xfce fulfills them:

1. A program like Gnome Do. I love Gnome Do and my DE must have a similar thing.
* A program like [Music Applet](http://www.kuliniewicz.org/music-applet/). Music Applet provides a quick way to see to which song I'm listening to and to pause my music player (and skip songs).
* Does xfce work with compiz and awn?
* How well does xfce work with two monitors?
* Can I run Google Chrome, Pidgin, Clementine and Thunderbird without need to run separate things (for example: if you want to run Amarok under Gnome, you must run a few KDE apps)?

Sorry if my questions are a little noobish, but I'm really fed up with Gnome 3 and I'm too tired to search for answers; also, tommorow I must pass my math exam :(
Thanks in advance for your replies.

I've had a few trouble, but everything is fixed by reading the Wiki and looking around the forum. There is one however that I still can't fix. Brightness (backlight) setting. 

First my laptop specifications:  

* ASUS A43SV (on some region its called K43SV)
* Core i3
* 4GB RAM (Arch x64)
* GT540M (2GB VRAM) not NVIDIA optimus, thank god.
  
Most post in the forum that I encounter is dealing with ASUS laptop cannot change brightness using the fn keys. Well my laptop is doing that just fine. My problem is that, after rebooting, the brightness level go up to 100% again. And I have to turn it down everytime I boot into it.  
  
Is there any fix about this, or maybe this is how it supposed to work (I use XFCE), and I have to use startup script or something. I'm under the impression that if you set brightness, the setting is saved in the hardware (BIOS?) and not by the OS? Much like Desktop Monitor.

EDIT: I also have tried the ""acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor"" stuff. And it rarely sticks. It works one time (set my brightness all the way down), after that,  when I set it back up, it turned down again after reboot.

I'll start with the reason I want to do this as maybe there's a better solution. Ideally I'd like to keep kde installed and just not update it with my normal updates, yet update the libs needed. The reason is that I'd like it installed because every now and then I'll use it, but everytime I do a pacman -Syu often times half the stuff is kde related, and also I normally use xfce and slim as my login manager, everytime kde gets updated it changes itself to be the default login session which is simply annoying making me reset it after each system update. 

Afaik really the only thing I care about related to kde is kdevelop, but when I try to do a pacman -R kde it complains the libs are needed by so and so. So in so far as removing it, how would I go about this? Do I need to uninstall kdevelop and then reinstall it? Is there a better solution that doesn't require removing it at all?

Recently the power was cut (I think?) due to some people messing with the breakers to do construction elsewhere in the house.

Just last weekend I installed an APC UPS backup battery with a USB connection since the server runs a RAID that can easily get messed up if the computer isn't shutdown properly. Due to a number of complications, I was unable to really test it much after installation before having to leave.

Anyway, my theory is, power was cut, the server automatically hibernated and turned off the battery, and then came out of hibernate when the power was restored. That, or the battery shutdown before the server could complete hibernation resulting in a journal recovery and fsck scan on reboot (like I said, didn't get to test this much).

Anyway, the server didn't come back online so I had my parents take a picture of what it was displaying on its monitor. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/q7icb.png) is that picture.

So from what I can tell, something has happened with systemd... but I'm not entirely sure what. I can't find any information online either.

I'm aware that Windows 7 will overwrite GRUB, so I've gotten Gparted for partitioning, SuperGRUB for rewriting GRUB, and of course the Windows 7 CD. 

But it turns out my partitioning table looks like this:

/dev/sda2 - swap
/dev/sda3 - /
/dev/sda4 - /home

And I guess when I created them, they were all primary partitions and I didn't anticipate that it would be a problem in the future. But apparently Windows 7 won't install on anything but a primary partition, and I'm only allowed a maximum of 4 primary partitions. Is there any way to do this without having to reinstall Arch? I just got it to the point where I love it, but I really do need Windows 7 on this laptop as a fallback just in case something goes wrong.

I'm guessing I will have to backup my /home, then somehow delete the partition, change it to extended (possibly add the swap to the extended partition), then map the /home (and swap) on the fdisk or whatnot, but I'm not sure of the way to really do that.

The problem is that its DLNA support is limited to a few formats that almost no one uses. This has forced me to transcode pretty much every file that I play on my TV. However, since the TV and computer both plug into the wireless router, this means that when an HD video file is being transcoded, wireless throughput drops to almost nothing.

My solution, since I do not have any way to set up VLANs, was to just buy another NIC for my computer, and connect the TV directly to the computer, and then NAT the TV's IP address to the main interface's IP using iptables so the TV can still get out to the internet.

1329452275.0	ptexm	Demoted packages and AUR helpers	sporkexec	15	4	7	"This applies to yaourt and packer, at least.

Often when a package is obsoleted and moved out of the official repositories, some kind community member will pick up the slack and maintain it on the AUR. Things like hal and a handful of [multilib] packages like lib32-db come to mind.

The trouble with this is that when somebody runs `packer -Syu` or `yaourt -Syua`, these packages are upgraded, even when the package was *never explicitly installed.* Of course, you should always review everything from the AUR, read `PKGBUILD`s, etc. This doesn't change that, but there will always be people who can't be bothered to do it, or implicitly trust packages with important names (libraries, system tools, etc).

For example, [tcp_wrappers has over 500 votes](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=52064) and probably thousands of users, because it was a damned-near mandatory package in [core] which was dropped. This creates an extremely low barrier to entry where a malicious package could be installed by many users just by uploading the right package at the right time to the AUR.

I realize the burden to prevent this does not fall upon Arch devs. It falls upon users first to read what they install, and the authors of AUR helpers second if they want to guard against this. But how **can** AUR helpers guard against this? AFAICT pacman's local db doesn't track the origin repository of a package. Nor can it be looked up in the sync db, because it has been removed. Is there anything we can do about this or a sensible workaround?"	t5_2qrzu	True

1295232369.0	f3k29	Random computer freezes with Arch, unsure of cause or solution.  Anyone think they can help?	Cuzit	15	3	53	"On my [laptop, an Asus G73jh](http://www.asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=8je5Ot4HBnKOdT81), I'm using Arch (2.6.36-ARCH) with Gnome, compiz-fusion, and emerald as my window manager.  The laptop has an ATI Radeon 5870 video card, which I'm using the latest Catalyst drivers for from the AUR.

The problem is that the entire system occasionally and randomly just freezes.  The entire computer.  No mouse, no keyboard movement, nothing happening on screen; even trying to kill the X server with CTRL+ALT+Backspace doesn't work.  I want to assume it has something to do with Catalyst, but I can't be sure.  It happens randomly, and nothing in particular seems to cause it.  Sometimes I'm just redditing on Firefox, sometimes playing Minecraft, sometimes doing nothing at all (I'll close the lid and come back in an hour or two to find an unresponsive computer).  Because of this, I can't narrow it down definitively to know what the problem is, but my intuition says it could be a misconfigured xorg.conf or something related to the drivers.

If you need more details, logs, etc. comment and I will update this post.  I'm going to post my [xorg.conf](http://www.cuzitproductions.webs.com/xorg.conf), [rc.conf](http://cuzitproductions.webs.com/rc.conf), and my [xorg log](http://cuzitproductions.webs.com/Xorg.0.log) for now.  If any other information or logs are required, request them.  If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it, as this is very annoying.

(On a side note, if anyone can help me get TF2 running with this graphics card, that would be awesome, too.  It goes black on the loading screen and in the main menu the graphics are fuzzy and miscolored, so you can't see anything.  OpenGL is functional, however.)

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the suggestions, everyone.  I'm going to bed now, but in the morning I'm going to use all of your suggestions to see if I can solve my problem, or at the very least narrow the cause down a bit.  Thanks everyone!

**EDIT2:** Due to my [little mistake](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/f3k29/random_computer_freezes_with_arch_unsure_of_cause/c1d5ote), I'm going to have to reinstall Arch.  I'm going to do that tomorrow and try to narrow the problem down a bit.  For example, I will start with the open source drivers, use them for a while, switch to Catalyst, and see if my system starts freezing after that.  If so, it's something to do with Catalyst.  I refuse to believe the issue can't be resolved, as the Catalyst drivers have worked *flawlessly* for me on other distros with similar setups, so why wouldn't they on Arch?  I'll try to have some new information to post tomorrow sometime as I will hopefully be able to narrow down the problem.  Again, thanks for the help, everyone!

**EDIT3:** Big thanks to NihilisticAbandon, who has been privately messaging me with advice over the last couple of days.  I believe the problem has been resolved - I haven't had the laptop freeze in a while.  I'm afraid to say definitively that the problem is gone, however, but in all cases it seems to be.  If anyone else has any problems similar to mine, I'm afraid I can't tell you what I did to solve this problem; making a stupid mistake and wiping my hard drive (see Edit2, above), I had to reformat Arch.  Other than the annoyance of having to redo everything, not only on Arch but on Windows as well, everything seems to be working much better than before, and I'm not sure why.  It's the magic of reformatting, I guess. * shrugs *  I do regret not learning much from this experience, as it doesn't give me any advice to pass along to fellow Linux users who may encounter a problem similar to mine, but I'm glad that it seems to be resolved.  Hopefully there will not need to be an edit4 because the problem came back. :D

Currently, the first thing I see after the boot output ends is SLiM, which I have set up with a default user, so all I have to do is type my password and press enter. Afterwards, I see i3.

There seems to be a lot of lag time between the boot output and SLiM and between SLiM and i3. Would it be wise to skip the display manager step and boot straight into i3? Is this common?

Would this approach be secure? Also, is it possible to still get a password prompt? I was thinking that having i3 and i3lock pop up at the same time would be a good idea, since as soon as I finished typing in my password, i3 would instantly be behind it.

Is there any good reason not to skip the display manager? It seems to just be a waste of time for anyone with only one user on their system.

This is my second time installing archlinux, the first time I was runing arch+awesome and it was a very pleasant experience. 

I then went to Mint for awhile last month because my worked wanted to try something on it (that was after the /bin/ merge with /sbin) and now I'm back onto arch + awesome again.

This time, with arch x64 and awesome, I noticed some things are a bit different.  Take for example, when I open up firefox, and I write a lengthy email and I wish to click on a text in the middle to fix an error, I click, nothing happens, then finally after 4 seconds I see the blinking cursor.

With the terminal (I'm running the urxvt-unicode-patched found in aur), when ever I exit it, sometimes it hangs and just shows a black box with none of the ""user@hostname"", just a black box and after some time it disappears.

With awesome manager, when I try to switch to different tags/workspaces by cycling wiht my hotkeys, there is a stall too.

Then my favourite part of arch is that, I'm so used to having it shutdown immediately.  Like, with my last archlinux+awesome set up, I just binded the keys ""ctrl+esc"" to do ""systemctl poweroff"" and it does so without any problems and the shutdown is done in 3 seconds (love, love LOVE it).  Now, when I do, the screen goes black, and it kind of hangs at a black screen with a _ cursor blinking at the top left, after 40 seconds it shuts down.

I did notice something different when I boot this time, it says ""kvm"" disabled by kernel this time around.  Perhaps that plays a role?

Any help will appreciated, thanks in advance.

While I'm using my Arch install for development, I'm able to hop on Mumble and chat.  Today I installed the android-sdk from the AUR.  I had mumble open whilst installing the sdk - thinking nothing of it (if that could be a problem?).  When I talked to my friends for the first time (after the installation of the SDK was complete), they said I sounded terrible.  The descriptions were anything from a robot to a wookie.  

So I started troubleshooting: I ran through the audio wizard in Mumble and I sounded great.  I rebooted into Windows and logged into Mumble.  They said I sounded just fine.  When I rebooted back to Arch, I had the same problem.  I've uninstalled and re-installed mumble and all its dependencies to no avail.  I'm not sure what else I can check.

So I checked the prerequisites for android-sdk:

java-runtime

lib32-alsa-lib

lib32-libstdc++5

lib32-libxv

lib32-ncurses

lib32-openal

lib32-sdl

lib32-zlib

swt

I'm wondering if lib32-alsa-lib could have some effect?  I just say this because the name contains alsa - not really any other reasons.  If you wizards could help me troubleshoot this, that'd be great.  I'm not sure what direction to even go.

Thanks!

After connecting my surround system to my desktop, I've been trying to get surround sound working on my system. I installed pulseaudio, and hey presto, minecraft had surround sound. Then, last night, when I went to log in again, my login would hang indefinitely. I removed pulseaudio, but then today learned that the issue was that I hadn't started avahi daemon. I added avahi-daemon to my rc.conf, reinstalled pulse, and was able to log in again.

However: minecraft is now in stereo. I can't figure out how to make it work otherwise, and I don't have any other programs that generate surround sound (speaker-test -D surround51 -c 6 works fine, but I don't think that's pulse, and I *must* specify surround51). I tried installing pulseaudio-alsa (which I apparently should have installed from the start?) but that did noting perceptable. Any ideas?

I should add that minecraft was in stereo before installing pulseaudio the first time, and that I've tried setting default-sample-channels = 6. Also in the pasystray GUI, the output is set to Analog Surround 5.1 Output + Analog Stereo Input

Anyways, I am working on my (college) senior design project.  The way my college works is that I (as a computer engineer) work with 3 other electrical engineers on our senior design project. I won't go into too much depth about our project while we are still working on it.

I (as the lone computer engineer) am in charge of all the code writing, and since our project will at some point require us to write device drivers, I decided that I would prefer working in Linux environments as I am highly comfortable with it.  Progress on my end has been steadily coming, meanwhile my group members have finished most of their work ahead of schedule.  So a group member has been reassigned to start working on GUI.  I up til now, I have been working entirely on a CLI program.

About 30 minutes ago, one of our advisors started asking some questions about our roles, and my scumbag team member said he was planning on working on Windows.  I looked over to him a bit confused, as he started talking about installing GCC on Wndows.  I really didn't want to say anything in front of our advisor. Our advisor (not an idiot) knew that GCC was a *nix tool, and required Cygwin to run on Windows, so he started asking scumbag team member about it, who clearly having no idea what was going on said that Cygwin wasn't needed, that he should be able to just work with GCC with Eclipse on Windows.  

At this point, I could no longer hold my tongue, and I asked him why he didn't want to dedicate about 10GB to a Linux environment for our development seeing as all our development thus far has been related to *nix based environments.  He replied ""I don't have a legitimate copy of Linux.""

**edit:** I wanted to add some more clarification. We as a group decided on using an ubuntu solution mostly due to my familarity with linux.  They weren't willing to work in arch because of the small chance that a package update could create problems down the road.

His first project was to work with a grad student to decode a usb stream and write a linux kernel module for this usb device.  He finished that part of the project 2 weeks ago.  And he has seen me working on my linux laptop. He decided that he wanted to program in windows because he already had it, and didn't bother asking anyone about how feasible it would be.  I thought i was clear when we reassigned tasks that working under linux was more or less the only feasible solution. 

**edit to fix spelling, typing reliably on a tablet is harder than I thought.**

**edit3:** You have done a more than convincing job of letting me know I handled the situation incorrectly.  After thinking about it for a good while, I agree.  I honestly think he caught me more by surprise than anything else, because he never thought to discuss this with anyone before hand frustrated me as the team leader that this was being brought up to our advisor before I had ever heard the plans and could provide some input.  We have another meeting setup for tomorrow, and I intend to apologize to him then.  It's kinda late now, and I still have more work to do.  Oh, college life."	t5_2qrzu	True

1321991027.0	mlsx3	Trouble booting the Arch install ISO off of a USB stick from GRUB 2	Klink-a-dink-dink	12	2	12	"**SOLVED!** See solution [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/mlsx3/trouble_booting_the_arch_install_iso_off_of_a_usb/c3258co?context=3)

**Goal:** Have a multiboot USB stick that can boot to multiple Linux distros through GRUB 2's ISO-booting feature.

**The Issue:** I can't get the Arch Linux install ISO to boot properly.

I've formatted the stick, installed GRUB on it, and I've got the ISO on it (I followed [this guide](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/)). But here's where I'm running in to trouble:

It boots, successfully mounts the ISO and loads the kernel (and I assume the initrd because it never complains about it) but as soon as it tries to read `/arch/aitab` it fails.

I think the issue is my grub.cfg. I tried copying the one from the pendrivelinux tutorial, but there's no Arch option, so I tried to create one based off of it's advice: copying the APPEND options from the ISO's syslinux.cfg file. On the Arch Install ISO, that reads: `archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201108`

When I tried those options, it complained at the ""Waiting for boot device"" stage. It couldn't find `/dev/disk/by-label/ARCH_201108.` I realized that there was a discussion going on [here,](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=78171) and using some of their .cfg's I changed the archisolabel option to the actual label for the USB device, which is MULTITOOL. I also added the `ramdisk_size` and `locale` options.

It should be noted that this discussion ended *before* the official install ISO had loopback support, which it [does now.](http://www.archlinux.org/news/20110819-installation-media/)

When I tried the `archisolabel=MULTITOOL` option, I got further! It didn't fail after waiting 30 seconds! It just failed immediately. Great. Apparently it can't find `/bootmnt/arch/aitab`. Using ls on the ramfs, I realized that it had mounted the USB stick itself, not the ISO filesystem.

So, in summary, I can successfully mount the ISO from GRUB, GRUB boots the kernel, loads the inird, but then doesn't quite realize it should be mounting the ISO for the actual filesystem. (Or, if I go with the original options, doesn't realize that it should mount the USB stick to mount the ISO.)

Here's my grub.cfg on the stick:

    set timeout=10
    set default=0
    
    menuentry ""Arch Linux x86_64 Core Install ISO isofrom"" {
     loopback loop /isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso 
     linux (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz isofrom=/isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=ARCH_201108 ramdisk_size=75% locale=en_US.UTF-8
     initrd (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/archiso.img
    }
    menuentry ""Arch Linux x86_64 Core Install ISO isofrom multitool"" {
     loopback loop /isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso 
     linux (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz isofrom=/isos/archlinux-2011.08.19-core-x86_64.iso archisobasedir=arch archisolabel=MULTITOOL ramdisk_size=75% locale=en_US.UTF-8
     initrd (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/archiso.img
    }

I'd appreciate any advice on the matter, especially from anyone involved with release engineering (I'm almost certain I just don't have the right kernel parameters here).

I quite like Gnome 3, although I do acknowledge that it feels ""unfinished"" in some respects (more so in the 3.0 release).

As Arch is 'rolling release', the new packages always arrive fairly quickly. I was a bit put off by the fact that such a major new release was arriving just like any other update, although I knew this was going to happen. It wasn't that bad in hindsight.

However, I realised that I would be something like an ""early adopter"" as many ""conservative"" distros hadn't picked up Gnome 3 (yet). Gnome 2 was pretty much feature-complete when I installed it, but with Gnome 3 I would be ""watching"" the development of the DE *while I'm using it*.

**tl;dr:** I didn't have to adopt my workflow a lot when switching from Gnome 2 to Gnome 3. It actually improved with the workspaces and stuff. Was your workflow kind of hindered when you were ""confronted"" with KDE 4 and did you seek any alternatives, hold off upgrading?"	t5_2qrzu	True

1317335300.0	kvsfm	"Need a little help with my triple-head xorg
configuration"	jgottula	11	0	6	"Recently I decided to make the switch from AMD's proprietary catalyst/fglrx driver to the open source radeon driver. In short, I'm sick of dealing with poor/incomplete Linux support by companies like AMD (not to mention I won't stand for any more random X server freezes that cause me to lose all my work; the log file always cites the same line within some piece of AMD source code that I can't diagnose, modify, or report with any reasonable chance of seeing the problem fixed). I'm not using any 3D-heavy applications on Linux anyway, so I figure the right move is to start using the open source drivers.

Uninstalling and installing the drivers was easy. More difficult is getting the X configuration just right. I'm running three monitors off of my Radeon HD 5750: two off the VGA ports, and one off the DisplayPort (this being one of the supported triple-head configurations). All three monitors have 1280x1024 resolution, so the total resolution should be 3840x1024. Setting up a proper triple-monitor configuration on the proprietary driver was relatively trivial: just use AMD's graphical tool and have it save out to xorg.conf. Worked just fine. Unfortunately, now I have to set up the multihead configuration manually and no matter what I do, I can't even get things working like they were before.

At first I tried modifying my old xorg.conf file, just modifying the *Driver* line to say *radeon* rather than *fglrx*. Inexplicably, this gave me cloned output (where all three monitors show the same 1280x1024 image). Not helpful. Here's my old xorg.conf file:  http://pastebin.ca/2085389

Then I used KDE's monitor configuration tool, which is entirely capable of producing a working, perfect triple head configuration. Unfortunately, it only changes things on a per-session basis (and it doesn't touch the login manager so it's still cloned 1280x1024). I'd really prefer to have this in my xorg.conf file, as before.

So, I looked out on the interwebs for instructions on how to set up a multihead configuration. I wrote my own xorg.conf file using a few different pages' instructions, but no matter which set of instructions I tried to follow, I always ended up with cloned output. As usual, the dumb old X server acts like nothing is wrong and doesn't give me any helpful diagnostic information on why my configuration is wrong. (The day when Wayland replaces X and all its archaic baggage can't come soon enough; hopefully its way of configuring monitors won't be as head-bashingly terrible as X's.)

At one point, I managed to find a way of configuring my xorg.conf file that didn't result in cloned output; instead, this one made a 1280x1024 output on my middle monitor with nothing on the left or right ones (no idea why). It's closer to being the right thing, but I have no idea how to tweak it to get there and X isn't helping me out. Here's this xorg.conf: http://pastebin.ca/2085419

Does anyone know how to work from either of these configuration files to get the output I want? Or have a really good resource on how to set up multihead X configurations using open source drivers that might actually work for me? I can provide Xorg log files or other information if it would be helpful. Thanks!"	t5_2qrzu	True

I have a TP-LINK wireless card in so that I can switch connection and use any one at a time. I have to do this because the connections are not so stable And one might get down for a extended period of time, which is unacceptable to me.

I have 2 Internet connections. 1Mbps each (believe me that is the best I can get). I have 2 routers running, both are TP-Link, one at channel 1 another at channel 6. I use OpenDNS, as the default DNS are also god damn awful. 

And I don't even get 60KB up on any of them. But easily get 128KB on my laptop and netbook. 

This is my new build for my home office and some occasional gaming in mind

Configuration:

* Core i5 2310, Intel DH67CL Motherboard

* 500w Thermaltake Power supply

* 8GB Ram

* 3 disk drives

* HD Radeon 6750 PCIe graphics card


Help me out please :(

EDIT: 
Forgot to mention one other very important point. The wireless card gets missing randomly. After a Reboot it is detected again. this one happens both in Windows and Linux. And this always happens

I have a question for you guys...

* **Has anyone with an Arch system been able  to successfully install the ARM toolchain for Android kernel development?**

* **Also, has anyone been able to build Android from source (AOSP) or CyanogenMod from source under Arch? **

I ask because, it seems neither is possible under Arch... I've searched the forums and though there is a thread about the ARM toolchain, it basically died after the first 5 posts or so; with not much info. I know the Arch community is extremely knowledgeable, so if someone has the answers -- by all means do give me a run down of what I'd have to do to get this working.

Also, I currently own an EVO just to put it out there AND I was previous Arch user, but went to Ubuntu because I wasn't (at the time) able to figure out how to setup Arch to do the above, so I figured since Google uses Ubuntu as the native system to compile source and what not... I would too and switched to Ubuntu. However, lately Ubuntu has been giving me a headache and I'm realizing how much I really miss the ""rolling"" release mentality that Arch is based on. I know I could probably switch to LMDE for rolling releases, but I'd rather use Arch instead.

I would like very much to get back into using Arch... with with the requirement that the above two things can be done successfully.

So a few of may remember that a few days ago i had trouble installing the catalyst driver for my machine. Well, thanks to lots of help i got it down.

Ever since I have installed it though my resolution has been extremely wacked. Running Xandr does nothing.

Thank you for your help. If you need any more information just ask, I will be glad to provide.

Edit: I am slowly adding more information.

1024x768        0.0* 

I just ran the pacman -Syu command so currently eveything is up to date.

edit 2:

I restarted my computer and now when i boot up it goes to a black screen after showing the bios and then loads some things. goes to a straight black screen, lucky i had linux mint on live cd or i would not be posting right now. HELP!!

Edit:3

So using a archlinux live usb i uninstalled catalyst and catalyst utils using

    pacman -Ru catalyst catalyst-utils

was able to get back to my computer I am now attempting to reinstall

Edit:4 

So i reinstalled catalyst again, I will run you guys by with the exact commands i used.

    sudo pacman -Syu
    sudo pacman -S catalyst catalyst-utils
    sudo aticonfig --initial
    sudo aticonfig --initial=check
    sudo reboot

So the computer reboots and would you guess it, black screen again. Now i have a couple of hunches, clearly I am doing something wrong.

I could be using the wrong driver, so heres my video card according to the command

1350528851.0	11o3qb	Trouble Installing [Help]	mpa1212	10	1	5	"So I had a go at installing Arch today, it did not go very well.
I have Windows 7 dual-booting with Wubi installed Kubuntu
I felt well prepared, I had read the Beginners Guide a couple times, installed Arch in a virtual machine and done quite a bit of research on many of the things that you touch when in installing (Partitions, filesystems, looking at their tips and troubleshooting.)
So to prepare for the install I freed up space on my main Hard Drive, backed up the personal files (pictures,musics).
Then I started Gparted in a LiveCD of Ubuntu, and partitioned the harddrives into Boot, root, /var and /home. This is where it went wrong. Gparted took its time partitioning then suddenly closed, but it seemed to have completed its job because the partitions showed up in the explorer (blanking on its name). So I rebooted, to make sure all was going well (in windows) which it was not. Windows ran its check and detected errors, then restarted the computer. After the startup screen (before BIOS) all that would be displayed was a _ blinking in the top right corner. After trial and error(spamming f12 over and over on the starting screen after restarting) I got Arch to boot from the LiveCD (as my computer won't boot from USB for some reason) and started mounting the partitions and everything was working (going through the Beginners Guide) until I reached setting up mirrors, which when I tried to open Nano would result  in an error complaining about the Terminal and linux (but the linux would switch depending on xterm (?)). I managed to open it with Vi (first time using Vi) and see that everything looked ok. The big trouble started when I tried to update,download or synch packages (pacman and pacstrap). No matter what I did it would not verify the keys (Tried pacman-key -init, checking the time (which was correct) and a large amount of googleing).


TL:DR Tried installing Arch, managed to mess up windows (presumibly) and couldn't get Arch working (Vi had some upstream error, nano about terminal and TERM, packages wouldn't verify). 

Any ideas of what I can do to fix Windows and get Arch up and running and what went wrong? 
I have a Arch CD and Ubuntu lying around, along with another computer if needed. Prove to be the helpful community that Arch boasts

Edit 1:The data which was important is fine, on a second harddrive along with an external one.
As for what happens at start up what happens is that when I turn the computer on a screen that displays a brand name and f2 for setup, f12 for boot menu. After a loading bar finishes it doesn't go into BIOS it just goes black and displays a flashing ""_"". The only way I can get it to go into the boot menu is from pressing f2 and f12 repeatedly then BIOS will start and it will ask me where to boot from. For whatever reason it has always refused to boot from a USB. 
When I boot from the hard drive Windows is on it gives an error and asks to boot from a floppy. If I try to put the Windows CD in it asks to install windows or repair, and when I try to repair Windows it says the CD isnt compatible with my version of windows (both windows 7).
I can get into Ubuntu from the CD which runs fine.


Edit/Update 2: Got Arch working! What I did was turn all the partitions I had into unallocated space then used Arch's partitioner while installing, then just followed the Beginners guide. Thanks for the help!

One solution would be something like Wubi, but apparently its Ubuntu specific, and it doesn't install on its own filesystem proper.

The best solution might be to install some boot manager like grub to boot from the USB or even from a disk image file directly on the hard disk, and from then on continue with a dual boot installation as usual.

Have found out that grub now runs in cygwin, but I have been able to find detailed information on how to use it from windows.  It seems like it needs a separate /boot partition and am not sure how to create that when I only have windows on the system.  

Another idea that I have had is to install coLinux, then use that to re-partition the drive, install grub, and then use that to install the dual-boot system that I want.

Anyways, at this point I am not sure which direction to take, which way will yield the best results.  My intermediate goal is to have a dual-boot ArchLinux/windows system, and then get rid of Windows altogether if I can get the wireless and the rest of the hardware to work.

- Pidgin (echo cancel not working either)

- Ekiga (crashed frequently, no Jingle support)
- Linphone (good, but no Jingle support)

I was thinking about trying harder to setup PulseAudio properly so that Empathy or Pidgin get echo cancel. Alternatively I might be able to get Jingle support with Asterisk, so Linphone might be an option. Any experience with this?

I have a radeon 7750 HD graphics card and two monitors in portrait orientation. I'd like to rotate my screens in arch, but I can't seem to get it working. Screen 1 is DVI-1 and Screen 2 is VGA-0. I've tried xrandr --output DVI-1 --rotate right (and left) with no changes. I've also tried it with arandr but all it does is rotate my mouse cursor. Any ideas?"	t5_2qrzu	True
1373638583.0	1i5jer	Dual boot, Encryption and Hybrid MBR?	deusexcaelo	7	0	8	"So I've been planning out my install, because I want to go back to using Arch, and I'm having a bit of trouble on how to set it up. Originally, I had already partitioned and installed Arch on a hybrid MBR setup with an empty partition for Windows (which means I haven't installed Windows yet then).

So what I want to do is this: Install Arch with the Hybrid MBR (I'm on BIOS, duet doesn't work) and dm-crypt, install Windows then TrueCrypt, and then restore GRUB2 for the bootloader. I'm not sure if it's possible, so I wanted to ask you guys."	t5_2qrzu	True
1373147725.0	1hrq3m	[Help] Having to run every mirror-based command twice?	XZQT	12	3	16	"I've had my install up and running for a couple of weeks and chose Arch as my first distro to completely replace Windows with. Anyway, during the install I uncommented all the mirrors in ~/mirrorlist from the UK (since that's where I am) and then proceeded to run pacstrap as specified in the install guide.

During the install (and in *every* time I've run pacman -Syu/-Syy since) updates will fail the first time, like such:
    
    error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from mirror.bytemark.co.uk : Could not resolve host: mirror.bytemark.co.uk
    error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from archlinux.mirrors.uk2.net : Could not resolve host: archlinux.mirrors.uk2.net
    error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from mirror.cinosure.com : Could not resolve host: mirror.cinosure.com
    error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from www.mirrorservice.org : Could not resolve host: www.mirrorservice.org
    error: failed retrieving file 'core.db' from mirror.us.leaseweb.net : Could not resolve host: mirror.us.leaseweb.net
    ^C
    Interrupt signal received

Nevertheless, the exact same commands will work *perfectly* after I interrupt that and run them again for a second time, despite the fact nothing has changed in any way:

     core                     102.8 KiB   902K/s 00:00 [######################] 100%

     multilib                 106.1 KiB   907K/s 00:00 [######################] 100%
Another issue I have that may be related to that is sometimes (not always, as with pacman) on Firefox a website will flat out fail to load the first time but then load instantaneously upon refresh (yet this issue isn't as annoying as the update one) 

I know my internet speed shouldn't be the bottleneck so I was just hoping for advice in correcting this issue. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

**EDIT: As of 31st July 2013, I managed to solve this problem thanks to /u/eyko. The root cause is a dodgy Intel wireless driver and by [disabling IPV6 via this method](http://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1hrq3m/help_having_to_run_every_mirrorbased_command_twice/cb2r2o9) the problem is solved** 
*(although you need to edit /etc/default, not /defaults as eyko misspelt)*. 

**Note that I couldn't get this to work in Syslinux so I switched to GRUB.** 

**I hope this can help someone else out in the future.**

1373140213.0	1hri3w	Strange issue- hanging on shutdown, corruption after hard reboot	calzoneman	10	3	7	"I've had an issue happen several times now, usually after updating but not always (so I can't fully assume that updating causes the issue).

The basis of the issue is that I will execute a `systemctl poweroff` or `systemctl reboot`, and my system will hang at a blinking cursor.  While in this state, I cannot access other TTYs with Alt+F#, nor does the magic sysrq appear to have any effect (I enabled it in `/etc/sysctl.conf`).

After a while of waiting and nothing happening, I manually powercycle the machine, and I see an expected message about recovering the ext4 journal.  Often, however, there are corrupt files following an update and I will have to chroot in from a CD and reinstall those packages with the `--force` option.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this issue, or tips for not breaking packages when it occurs?

My hard drive layout is like so:

`/dev/sda1` - ext4, 100GB, mounted at `/`

`/dev/sda2` - ntfs, 500GB, mounted at `/mnt/data` via fstab

`/dev/sdb1` - ntfs, 245GB, mounted at `/mnt/win7` via fstab

EDIT: I previously had the `quiet` option set on the kernel, but I turned that off so that if the issue occurs again I might get better information out of it."	t5_2qrzu	True
1372889606.0	1hlh3l	Need help on first install of Arch	darknesspanther	12	6	12	My roommate's grandparents gave us an old model imac which I decided to install arch linux on to try it out. Everything has been running smoothly until I tried to install the bootloader. The imac has an EFI motherboard instead of BIOS, so I was following the instructions for installing on EFI. However, when I try to set up the efi bootloaders, the system tells me that it won't load the EFI variables because the computer didn't boot in EFI (it booted from the live cd), but I can't boot from EFI because the bootloader isn't installed because the cd doesn't boot from EFI. It seems like I'm caught in a catch 22 here. If anyone knows of a way around this or something that I'm (very likely) doing wrong it would be greatly appreciated.	t5_2qrzu	True
