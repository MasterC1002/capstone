Give your man a massage without using your hands. Before you begin, slowly undress your partner, but make sure that he stays warm. Then, keeping your hands at your side or behind your back, stroke his body (all except for his penis) with your face, hair, and breasts. Once he's totally relaxed, rub your breasts against his penis and he'll happily rise to the occasion. —Nitya Lacroix, author of The Art of Tantric Sex

**I decided I'd actually try this.**

I leaned from my computer, flashing my biggest smile, looking from my desk to my boyfriend who was sprawled on the bed. ""Can I give you a massage..... "" He saw the cosmo tab open and was like ""fuck, what is it this time"". . At first, it's ""hey yeah, massages are sexy, boobs are sexy, combining them will be good!"". It did not end up like that. He, full credit to him, agreed to actually let me mash my face into his shoulder. It was incredibly unsexy. I felt like a stubborn mountain goat ramming my increasingly matted hair into his back. I tried putting my arms to the side and smashing my boobs, trying to get some kind of reaction - it was just hilariously unflattering, partially because I kept losing my balance. My long hair getting mashed in between us ended up lightly grabbing his skin and being a little painful.

Excellent. I endeavor to know myself better, so this should be informative. I shall play along to the best of my ability.

It might be worth noting that the 55 things (flagged with annoying bolded numbers I'll remove, when I don't just skip the 'advice' outright) are actually all personality traits, often conflicting ones. So you might be tasked with discerning from subtle cues if your boyfriend is a music box **665** or a shattered chandelier **666**, and it's quite clearly impossible to be both.

If you learn 55 things from this, number 56 is you're dating someone with more faces than Lon Chaney.

&gt; If you're curious about the new dude in your life but know better than to grill him with 20 questions, 

Oh, so you're *not* at the point where you're [having sex yet](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitCosmoSays/comments/185e0g/cosmo_says_if_you_havent_had_sex_in_awhile_andor/c8bvejj)?

&gt; You don't have to date a guy for six months to get the lowdown on who he really is. With the right clues, you can size him up in 10 minutes. 

Men are so simple like that. 

&gt; ""A man's actions — especially the ones you see in unguarded moments when he's not going out of his way to try to impress you (or doesn't realize you're watching) 

We're not at item 1 and we've already played the voyeuristic stalker card. Good job!

&gt; — can speak volumes about his character and personality traits,"" says Rita Benasutti, PhD, a psychotherapist who specializes in couple's issues. 

It wasn't my idea, our therapist said I should spy on you! 

Would now be a good time to mention that some people become shrinks to figure out why *they* are broken? 

&gt; To help you decode a guy you've just started seeing, Cosmo called on a team of experts 

I want you to remember that phrase. A TEAM OF EXPERTS.

&gt; **His Favorite Sport**

Feverish masturbation. 

Actually, they mean actual sports, the things that few people do rather than everyone. Though there's an odd disconnect where they contrast ""solo sportsmen"" with ""fans of mainstream sports"", as opposed to ""player of mainstream sports"". But it seems to be more a grammatical failing than an implication that a marathon runner and an armchair quarterback are physical equals. 

&gt; As for the guy who's just not into sports at all, ""he's an independent thinker, usually on the sensitive side.""

Of course, this shoots my grammar-mercy in the foot, since they count ""running"" in the solo category, so presumably a person who's not into sports at all is one who gets no exercise, but I don't think of lazy people as independent thinkers. Or, the entire section was meant to be *fans* of sports, and the writer just twisted the words of the expert badly. Speaking of, our sporting expert was...

&gt; relationship-skills coach Steve Nakamoto, author of *Men Are Like Fish: What Every Woman Needs to Know About Catching a Man*. 

Rather than blaming my vile personality and corpse-like visage for my bachelorhood, I prefer to blame other people. For instance, as a child, several of the older women in my life repeatedly said I would never remain single because ""Some girl will get her hooks into you!"" I suffered some small trauma from that statement. This guy's not helping.

&gt; **How Long He's Been Hanging with His Friends**

Er... depends on the friend, really. Anywhere from ""Since I was a teenager"" to ""Since I started my current job"" depending on the friend. My pals are not a single unchanging collective group. 

With the vagueness of these so far maybe one man *can* embody all 55 traits without contradiction.

&gt; A guy who has been friends with the same posse since he was 10 years old can certainly claim loyalty as one of his strong suits. But ""you better like what you see, because he's probably not great with change,"" says dating coach Liz H. Kelly, author of *Smart Man Hunting*. ""And be patient, because it will take a while for you to win his trust."" 

I find placing food nearby and holding still helps earn the trust of the wild dudebro. 

&gt; If your date has buddies from all areas of his life — i.e., college, the gym, work — don't be afraid to drag him to your cousin's wedding. 

Wait, *what*? Explain, please.

&gt; ""He has no problem schmoozing strangers and adapts to new situations easily.""

Okay, as a diehard introvert let me say fuck you. Having friends from different aspects of one's life and ""schmoozing"" have nothing to do with one another. One is people you see many times and have common ground with, and the other is strangers you will never see again because the wedding invitees of your girlfriend's cousin's future husband probably have less in common with you than a random slice of the population does.

&gt; **Credit vs. Cash**

Card 1 or card 2? I'm torn. Actually, I generally pay cash for small things. It's easier and my bank doesn't bitch me out for wearing out my debit card. (Up yours, Royal Bank.) 

&gt; A guy who likes to flash his plastic craves status. ""He may be ambitious and confident. He'll reach his financial goals,"" says Rob Ronin, Psy.D., a licensed clinical psychologist and registered financial consultant. 

A guy who flashes credit cards a lot to his date has either already reached his goals or will *never attain them*.

Hold up... ""licensed clinical psychologist and registered financial consultant""? *Really?* 

&gt; ""If he always pays in cash, he's self-sufficient and independent,"" which might make him a difficult dude to corner. 

Or he doesn't want to be tracked, or he was burned by identity theft, or his credit sucks....

&gt; And if his wallet is dry? Here's a guy who's dependent on others to take care of him.

Or you know, recession. Or do they mean someone who's always getting his date to pay? That's not ""dependent"", that's a leech.

&gt; **His Bad Habits**

I told you, feverish masturbation!

&gt; Gambling men are risk-takers, which can make them a lot of fun. 

Because sitting next to your date for three hours watching him pull a lever and bum twenties is *great* fun. Been there, done that, never doing that again.

&gt; ""But their over-the-top optimism that they'll come out ahead makes it difficult for them to face reality,"" says Mitchell Parks, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville. 

Really? I wasn't aware that a gambling addiction led to a detachment from reality. Thank you, doctor.

&gt; ""Hard-core smokers tend to be anxious,"" says Dr. Parks, so it can be hard to pin them down for couple-time. 

No worries, if he gets anxious he can always light another one up. I hear smokers can also be *very* hot in bed, though usually only if they're also....

&gt; And if he's a boozer, he could be hiding his insecurity behind his buzz.

So, not ""boozer"" like has a drink at night but ""boozer"" like *alcoholic*? Maybe he's insecure about his CRIPPLING LIFE-RUINING ADDICTION. Just a guess.

None of these are habits, they're all addictions! Why would one further psychoanalyze someone who's already exhibiting the surest sign of an addictive and self-destructive personality? Why isn't one running away very fast?

I thought we stopped calling addictions ""bad habits"" (and thus sins of similar intensity to nose-picking) when I was about twelve.

&gt; **His Communication Style**

Grunts.

&gt; When your date opts to email you — rather than call — he could be a hard nut to crack. ""The fact that he chooses a communication method that allows him to edit what he says signals that he might not want to show his true self,"" says Jeff Bryson, PhD, professor of psychology at San Diego State University. 

Before telephones everyone was a hard nut to crack, what with letters and all.

&gt; An IM addict 

You can edit IMs before you send them too, you know that? They don't go one character at a time.

&gt; craves your nonstop attention and needs that instant assurance that you're there for him. 

Do you do understand what ""asynchronous communication"" is? IMs are less instant than a telephone call, and little different from e-mail. You can wait to reply to a text, but you're caught on the phone the second you pick it up. 

30 IMs in as many minutes? Yes, that's needy. But so is 30 phone calls or 30 e-mails.

&gt; And the phone fan? He might be a little old-fashioned and likes to do things by the book. But, according to Bryson, ""He's not afraid of intimacy.""

Great, you're broken no matter what you use to communicate. Apparently using your cell phone to TALK to people makes you ""old fashioned""? 

&gt; **The Clothes You Wear That Turn Him On**

Something with Velcro down the front for easy tearing-open.

&gt; If your fave T-shirt and jeans or a cute little sundress do more for him than your slinky black number, you're dating an earthy, laid-back guy who likes equally laid-back, low-maintenance chicks. 

Maybe he likes the color.

&gt; A man who's wowed by a woman who likes to get dolled up in high-end designer duds places a high priority on prestige. 

What about a man who's wowed by a woman who likes to get dolled up in duds that aren't insanely expensive? Is there a space in this world for the man who doesn't need to know who you're wearing?

&gt; And a guy who wants a Carmen Electra-sexy girl on his arm is looking for an ego boost. ""He places a lot of value on being admired and envied.""

I wasn't aware that ""a Carmen Electra-sexy girl"" was a form of clothing. Did someone shoot Carmen and turn her into a stole? 

&gt; **How He Likes to Party**

Party like 'sexy' party or party like 'social' party? Because it's completely naked either way.

&gt; He might be gorgeous, but if he can't cut loose with his friends, he's probably uptight and self-conscious, 

Okay, as a diehard introvert let me AGAIN say fuck you. 

Also, here's a question: How does a ""night out with the boys"" differ from ""cutting loose with his friends""? Because even my cold, dark, damaged, introverted heart arranges for weekly ""nights out with the boys"". Call it a party? Hell no.

Oh, and apparently party animals are needy and attention-craving. So I guess they IM a lot?

&gt; **How He Deals with Traffic**

Once again, I must say ""feverish masturbation"". Though only at red lights because of the hands-free laws.

&gt; If he constantly weaves in and out of cars, tailgates slowpokes, and flips other drivers the bird, 

He's a fucking douche. 

&gt; ""it's pretty clear that he has a problem with aggression,"" says Leon James, PhD, professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii and author of *Road Rage and Aggressive Driving*. 

Why are we consulting a doctor focusing on *road rage* for relationship advice? 

&gt; If he's able to exude Zenlike calm when stuck in gridlock, ""he's likely to have more self-control.""

Oh, so the sweating when I take Valium is actually liquid Zen? I'll have to bottle it and sell it to gullible Buddhists. And they're all gullible - none of them noticed when I met the Buddha on the road and killed him. 

Shame those hands-free laws weren't one year sooner.

&gt; **If He Always Initiates Sex**

After ""feverish masturbation"" three times, I'm certainly not initiating sex now!

&gt; Does your guy jump your bones whenever, well, he gets a boner? ""He's probably confident in your mutual attraction,"" according to sexologist Sandor Gardos, MD. 

His names are almost anagrams, my arguments are invalid.

&gt; Surprisingly, however, he could also be on the conservative side and believe in traditional gender roles. As for the guy who waits for you to green-light him before making his move, 

Wait, are we talking about rape? The ""jump your bones whenever he gets a boner"" was a little aggressive, but now you're saying that's also the opposite of ""waiting for you to green-light him"".... I feel *very* uncomfortable right now.

&gt; ""he's likely to be an eager-to-please person or still healing a damaged ego from some serious rejection in his past.""

Or maybe he's not a rapist!

&gt; **What Time He Prefers to Have Sex**

When I'm erect. Works better.

&gt; You're dating a spontaneous go-getter if he's bent on a.m. booty. 

""Bent on""? As in ""determined, approaching obsession""? Please, enough squicky rapiness!

But sometimes it's just that getting older means it doesn't get up as often and not using the morning wood seems... a bit ungrateful.

&gt; While his high energy makes him a blast, his need for instant gratification might grate on your nerves. 

It's worse when he IMs you at a party while he fucks you in the morning.

&gt; If he only wants nighttime nooky, he's probably a romantic at heart but a little tame, explains sex therapist Carole Altman, PhD, author of Electrify Your Sex Life. Don't expect the Kama Sutra, but prepare for long, sensual sack sessions.

Have you *read* the Kama Sutra? Some of that shit takes a long time to set up! And is as useful as Cosmo's sex advice.

(TIL that men only have sex at one time in the day without ever changing.)

&gt; **What He Orders in a Restaurant**

More relevant is how he treats the wait staff. But... meh, salad. I'm certainly not ordering spaghetti. I don't need the added challenge of pasta handling skills on top of first date banter.

&gt; A meat-and-potatoes-type guy is usually steady and dependable, says image coach Dianne Daniels, author of *Polish and Presence: 31 Days to a New Image*. 

An *image coach*? I... Brain. Hurt.

&gt; ""But he's also a little unadventurous."" If your date goes for exotic dishes, ""you're with someone who makes spontaneity a priority and could easily get bored with the status quo.""

I'm surprised an image coach didn't come up with the obvious ""if he orders an exotic dish he's showing off for his date"". 

Also: Salad is neither meat-and-potatoes nor exotic. Once again, I am an aberration from Cosmo's image of the norm.

&gt; **Neat Freak or Messy Man**

I'm more of a clutter bunny.

&gt; A guy who puts his dirty socks in the hamper is one thing; a guy who color-codes them in his drawer is something else. 

Yes, he has an orange cat that eats lasagna. And even he is taken.

&gt; ""This man is way too fastidious to have fun,"" explains Daniels, ""and he'll expect you to be just as neat."" 

So, the lesson here is to go through your date's sock drawer. Where does this fit into the titular 10 minutes? 

&gt; A mildly messy man is looser and more open-minded. But if the inside of his shower has never seen a scrub brush, he may be immature or just plain lazy, and do you really want to see what shape his sheets are in?

Well, seeing as you're already going through his bedroom drawers, the condition of the bed sheets should be obvious.

It's preposterous that a guy will get to know you. You're condemned to being *wild* and ... *different*.

&gt;A mere glance at my Facebook wall reveals that all my friends in new relationships are blonde, and all the engaged-to-be-marrieds just happen to be brunette. Coincidence? I think not! It is clear: I have to change my hair color.

But which to choose?! Do I go blonde to ease into a new relationship, or brunette to show I'm serious?

&gt;In public, I don't really recognize myself with light hair. I worry the rest of my look doesn't really live up to my hair.

Don't worry, now that you've changed your hair color, romance isn't far behind. And that's all you wanted, right?

&gt;""It's more sexually aggressive, and yet, it's kind of icy at the same time,"" Adam says.

Huh?

&gt;""I think the issue is hair dye,"" says Sean. ""Everybody does it, but with brunettes, you often can't tell. I usually associate blonde with 'fake,' and that leads to this presumption of unwholesomeness. I would guess that most men have a blonde fantasy, but brunettes seem closer to nature.""

Soooo blonde wasn't the way to go after all? Well, fuck me.

How does one patent dating advice? Anyway, this has nothing to do with hair. I like you, Eva.

While not Cosmo or such, it's clearly written as if it were in that august publication. So I guess this is Cosmo fan-fic, in a sense. The *Fifty Shades of Gr-however-you-spell-it* to Cosmo's *Twilight*. And just like *Fifty Shades*, the main character must want to get smacked around a bit because I can't think of any other reason to write what amounts to a hit piece aimed at 3ish% of the male population. 

&gt; Does Your Man Have A Secret? – How To Tell If Your Boyfriend is Gay

Two easy ways: 
1) You see him fucking a guy.
2) You see a guy fucking him.

More exotic techniques have been reported involving fortunate Frenchmen, but the Gaul Gangbanger is a skittish beast, who has yet to fall for even our most accurate stuffed decoys.

&gt; Girls, there’s a little secret that some of your boyfriends/husbands are hiding. They’re gay. 

I'm not going to make fun of the rest of this paragraph because it talks about homosexuals (though only males) facing persecution in many parts of the world, and societal or familial pressures in most of the rest. Unfortunately, while most of us knew that from watching the news (or God forbid, on Reddit), Guest has decided on a far better source, revealed in the next paragraph: 

&gt; How do I know all of this? Because many of my gay friends have sexual trysts with married men on a regular basis! 

So, you hang around with only gay men and homewreckers, huh? 

&gt; While there is a small number of men who are completely straight acting and could fool anyone with the most advanced gaydar system, there is an even larger number of men who’s hips have more swing than a Six Flags amusement park. 

I was going to point out how offensive that comment is, but then I hit ""more swing than a Six Flags amusement park."" While not the amusement park sort myself, when I think of Six Flags Over Sheboygan or whatever, I think of the coasters, not the... swings? Well, there is that kid ride that's a boat that swings, I guess. Or has Six Flags become some sort of den for people who swap spouses? 

I live down the street from a swinger's club. Boy, was the accountant next door *pissed* that he was sharing a parking lot with them. For guys who are stereotypically boring, they have a distressing amount of rage on tap when they need it.

&gt; Girls, I don’t care what anyone says, there is no such thing as an effeminate straight man.

I personally am grateful there's billions of people, as individual ones keep giving me reasons to never speak to them.

&gt; If you think you’re found a sensitive, caring man who isn’t a sex fiend because you’ve been dating for 6 months and he hasn’t tried to sleep with you, he’s gay. 

I don't know what's more offensive, assuming that all men have a hellfire-fueled sex drive or assuming that all women don't.

&gt; No man is THAT considerate. If you’re married to a man and his behavior has all the earmarks of an affair, it may not be with a woman.

Because you gotta give the stink-eye to every single twenty-year-old in a pair of low-risers, not just the females.

&gt; Since my best gay friend 

I wonder if he knows my best Negro friend? 

&gt; sleeps with a seemingly enormous number of married men each month, 

Okay, I'm starting to doubt this guy exists, but if he does he's almost certainly lying. His many conquests are all married to his roomie's Canadian girlfriend. It's an excuse for why you never see him with them.

&gt; he’s helped me to compile some tips. The top 20 reasons your man may be gay. Now, it’s obvious that much of this list is tongue in cheek, 

So I've sat through 5 paragraphs of offensive personal fantasy for no reason. Gee, thanks, now I'm going to have to repost this on another site just to waste other people's time so I can feel I'm not alone in this.

&gt; but there are serious signs mixed in also. 

I love it when things do that. Just last week I was bandaging up a sucking chest wound and the emergency instructions said ""Step 5: Stick your finger in and see if the lungs feel squishy."" Boy, was I embarrassed when Step 6 was ""Gotcha!""

&gt; - He will not touch you or reluctantly touches you.

So was that one of the tongs-in-cheek ones? It certainly would be if the author recognized the existence of bisexuals, but apparently she thinks a roll of 3 on the Kinsey table means ""Roll again."" 

&gt; - He listens to showtunes, Madonna, Cher, Judy Garland, and Barbra Streisand.

And it was a homosexual male who helped you compile this list? Your real gay friend, he has a really bad lisp, doesn't he? And he wears pink or leather. or pink leather? And he calls you ""girlfri-eh-eh-end!"" a lot? Because I am sure he doesn't exist now. 

&gt; - His profession is one of the following: visual merchandiser, interior decorator, florist, event planner, ballet dancer, piano bar singer, beautician, CEO of a major fashion or cosmetics label, or works at Bloomingdale’s, Saks Fifth Avenue or Barney’s.

Yeah, the janitor at Saks is always *such* a flamer. Also... CEO? Really? Is everyone married to a CEO? Also, as far as cosmetics labels go, I guess the entire Faktorowicz family was living in denial. (You know the patriarch better as ""Max Factor"". His sons and later grandsons were all part of the family business.) Oh, and Ronald Perelman (no, not Hellboy), who's had more wives than Six Flags has swing. 

...

SEE HOW STUPID IT SOUNDS?

Though now that I think about it, I can't name a cosmetics CEO who's not Jewish. Maybe the Jewish banking conspiracy is that they're all in the closet together?

&gt; - Doesn’t know what the difference is between a tight end and a fullback

I know this one! It's directorial shorthand in gay porn, right? The fullback gets behind the tight end and....

&gt; - You’re out in the park playing baseball and all he wants to do is to be in the outfield.

That doesn't even make sense. It's like Guest is mashing her face in her magic keyboard with the special ""Sports Metaphor"" hotkey.

&gt; - He says he’s ‘metrosexual’ but he’s had more manicures and pedicures in the last month than you’ve had in the last year.
&gt; - You go shopping and he knows more about designer handbags than you do.
&gt; - He owns more designer handbags than you do.

That's less homosexual and more ""needlessly expensive transvestite"".

&gt; - You go to the video store and he suggests a chick flick.
&gt; - You look over during the mushy part of the chick flick and he asks you for a tissue.
&gt; - He owns plaid Ralph Lauren shorts that he likes to wear with a pink polo with the collar up and penny loafers without socks. And he’s put the pennies in.
&gt; - You come home from work and he’s redecorated in a pink motif.

PINK! I SO FUCKING CALLED IT!

Sorry, I'm out. This article has defeated me and ended my lucrative career as a general Internet douchebag before it could even begin. Maybe I should go back to snarking Cosmo.

If you want your eyes to bleed a bit more, the rest of the ""signs"": 

&gt; - You go to a bar and he orders a cosmopolitan.
&gt; - He punctuates every sentence with, ‘But I’m not gay.’
&gt; - You go shopping and he knows the difference between 400 and 600 count Egyptian and Suprema cotton.
&gt; - He wears male cosmetics.
&gt; - You open his medicine cabinet and he’s got more skin and hair products than you do.
&gt; - His favorite talk shows are Oprah and Ellen.
&gt; - He has a collection of John Waters DVD’s.
&gt; - You go to Starbucks and he orders a tall, double-cup, extra hot, no foam, soy, sugar-free vanilla latte.

Wow. Just, wow. I have no words. Though, I know someone who might be able to judge. [Eiki-sama?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R64JZ7pEZ4)

""Never Gain Weight During Marriage Because You Might Get Fatter Than Your Husband"""	hvisla	131	19	52	"&gt;* Since getting hitched five years ago, I've packed 25 pounds onto my 5'3"" frame, reaching 165 pounds and trading my size 8s for 12s. I never thought I'd really ""let myself go"" (my blood boils at that phrase), but I have lost touch with my old self.
&gt;
&gt;* I had recently read a new study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science that found that marriages are happier when the wife is the skinnier party — and it made me question how my weight gain was affecting my own marriage.
&gt;
&gt;* When I complained that we didn't have sex as often, my husband nodded to my yoga pants and said, ""Babe, you still turn me on. But I need something more to get me going."" His blunt comment really hurt — because he was right.
&gt;
&gt;* We've made a habit of dancing around the subject of my fuller body. But one rainy afternoon, my husband and I were cleaning, and he found an old photo of me wearing a sheer Cavalli blouse and skinny jeans. ""Damn, you were hot,"" he gushed. ""If you looked like this, we'd have 10 kids by now.""

I'm more sad that this woman feels like she needs to be smaller not just for herself, but so her husband finds her attractive. I also wonder if she liked her body at all before putting on weight, because a relatively small weight gain doesn't usually faze someone to this point who's already embraced their body for what it is. :/"	t5_2w1fs	True

**The A-Z of kinky (Abridged)** 

&gt;I (i.e. you): are you turned by you? There are lot of fetishes that involve self-love and some of the more random include autovampirism (imagining yourself as a vampire) or autozoophilia (imagining yourself as an animal or plush toy). Learning to love yourself (even if it's as a vamp) is never a bad thing, so try spending sometime imagining yourself in different fantasies and see what happens...

God damn did that get a little out there fast. Leaping straight towards furry territory pretty fast there cosmo. 

&gt;Objectophilia: Is your BF hot for his car? Some peeps can get turned on by objects (and we’re not talking vibrators). Anything from sofas to the fridge can be a hot spot for certain dudes, although even just experiencing true love with your fave handbag qualifies as objectophilia. If your BF is attracted to certain pieces of furniture like the table, why not move the party from the bed to the dining room?

He said he liked the new couch - LET'S HAVE SEX ON IT. Sigh Cosmo, you can actually like something without having to fetishise it. 

&gt; TENS unit: This is a medical-device-gone-kinky - it sends out electric currents. Its ability to create steady but adjustable (!) tingling sensations means it’s favoured by some fetishist for the not-so-medical aim of getting off.

This shit is actually pretty fucking important to get right. Side effects include death, burning and tissue damage, although that seems to be more if you have heart conditions, place the electrodes on certain areas (pacemakers, necks, inside you) or you don't know what you're doing. It's some pretty serious BDSM shit. Don't for the love of god just tell some poor girl to by devices to electrocute herself or her partner without mentioning that people need to do their fucking research. 

&gt; YOLO: You only live once, so don’t be scared to try anything you think will play into your fantasies.

The people writing this have degrees. 

&gt;Zoophilia: Do you find the idea of pretending to be a cat, and (possibly) wearing a collar or lapping milk out of the bowl kinda sexy? If you do, then you’re into zoophilia, which means you like to role play as an animal. This is different from bestiality, where the person actually wants to have sex with animals, and that’s just gross!

Yeah cosmo... That's not zoophilia. Wanting to role play as an animal is one thing, but the technical definition of zoophilia is sexual attraction to animals. Indeed one reader (CAZZIE25) jumped in and made the following comment:
&gt; Umm... Zoophilia actually IS sex with animals... you may want to change that - ""zoo"" meaning animals, and ""philia"" meaning friendship or love. It is defined as sex between a human and a non-human, or having a preference for sex with animals. You might want to check out Krafft-Ebing who coined the term in Psychopathia Sexualis. As it stands you are encouraging bestiality, or at least a desire for sex with animals. Whilst zoophilia and bestiality are considered synonymous terms, it has been argued that zoophilia is the DESIRE for sex with animals and bestiality is the ACT of having sex with animals. At best, you could make this about talking about people who have a fetish for animal skin or fur but it's pushing the boundaries of the word. What you have defined as zoophilia is actually just called animal-play, puppy-play, pony-play etc but is widely considered either a component of role-play or part of the 'Furry' fetish. Regardless Zoophilia is a synonym for bestiality, you have just given it an incorrect definition, hence you are suggesting your audience 'try something new' by considering sex with animals... :S

Goat rape? One's gotta be goat rape. 

&gt; In the beginning, guys go out of their way to show they care with blatant, over-the-top gestures. Learn why you shouldn't panic when, over time, his actions take a surprising turn.

Like goat rape. 

&gt; ""The wooing stage is about selling himself and putting his best foot forward,"" says Calgary, Canada, sexologist Trina Read, PhD.

Well, you're not doing your job. I must be within your sexologist range and I do not feel one iota more sexed. (What is the range on a sexologist? Damn Tyranid units, I never remember the numbers....)

Also, it's not only the guy ""selling himself"". Division of sexes is very close to a 50/50 balance - this is not a 'buyer's market' for either gender. 

&gt; **1. He shows his vulnerability.**

Okay, we're obviously easing into this with a not-strange thing that people do with friends, not just guys with girlfriends. The list will get more interesting to read as we go on. Like *The King in Yellow*.

&gt; ""Most men want to appear strong and in control, but behind that facade, they want to be nurtured,"" says Henry Cloud, PhD, author of *How to Get a Date Worth Keeping*.

One thing is definitely true: Henry Cloud did write that book.

&gt; **2. He takes fights to the finish.** 

Turning into Popeye? Yes, that certainly is strange.

&gt; ""Many men feel overwhelmed fighting with their partners,"" says Don Ferguson, PhD, author of *Reptiles in Love*.

You're switching experts at rate of one per three paragraphs, Cosmo. Highly-detailed cherry picking or extra ads between the ads? I'm not sure enough to put money down on either outcome.

&gt; So if your man steps outside his comfort zone to duke it out with you (verbally, of course)

Gee, thanks for that parenthetical addon. Really big of you.

&gt; ""Couples build intimacy through conflict,"" says Ferguson. ""It's how they deepen their knowledge of each other."" The trick is knowing how to fight fair. It's not about name-calling, blaming or even winning. 

If neither person is name-calling, blaming, or attempting to win, then it's not really an argument, is it? Hell, it barely reaches into ""debate"". It's a ""discussion"", or a ""chat"". I have rougher games of Scrabble than that.

Well, Cosmo's idea of sex often wanders away from ""mutual pleasant stimulation of sex organs"", invariably losing either ""pleasant"" or ""sex"" along the way. I guess it's only fair that their definiton of ""argument"" is ""~~emotional~~ discussion between ~~conflicting~~ people"".

&gt; **3. He guards his guy habits.**

Like peeing standing up?

&gt; Men are fiercely protective of their buddy time.

""Having friends"" is neither a ""guy"" thing, nor a ""habit""! 

[Hey! I think I found](http://s91291220.onlinehome.us/formica/foreveralonegirl.jpg) Cosmo's writers! Or their readership....

&gt; ""His fears about losing his independence may lead to his need to assert his autonomy so he can prove to himself — and to you — that love hasn't taken away his freedom,"" says Deborah Anapol, PhD, author of *The Seven Natural Laws of Love*. 

PhD count: 4

&gt; The best way to deal with these new interruptions in your 24/7 together time is to give him some slack. Matt, 31, can vouch for that. 

Who the fuck are you? No PhD, I ignore you. Away with thee!

&gt; **4. He stops talking as much.**

Well thank God. 

&gt; So when you start dating a dude who's willing to talk to you for hours on end, sharing all the juicy details of his life, you probably feel like you've snagged a rare gem. That is, until you're an actual couple and he adopts a monosyllabic conversation MO.

I've known people who never get to that ""shut up"" phase. Yes, your boss three jobs ago was a prick and you threw a toolbox at him. you already told me that one twice. Was it *really* necessary to call me out of the bathroom for this story? 

&gt; **5. He wants less sex.**

Cosmo normally devotes pages to averting this cardinal sin. 

&gt; That's what Lucy, 28, discovered. ""In the beginning, Peter and I had tons of amazing sex,"" she recalls. 

Nice choice of a fake name there. Claaaaassy.

&gt; ""So after a while, when he'd occasionally spend the night and just go to sleep, I got worried. One night, when we got home late from a party and he didn't want to get it on, I called him on it. He looked at me like I was crazy, then explained that he was simply tired — no big deal."" 

So, he got home late after spending the entire night interacting with you and other people, and he wanted to climb into a quiet bed and sleep rather than stay up for even longer having sex with the person who was probably already the primary focus of his attention for the past several hours. Well, *obviously* he's secretly gay.

This should not be a revelation at age 28. 18, maybe. Not 28. He had reason to look at you like you were crazy, because he was only then realizing that every relationship you had didn't make the half-year milestone and that *you are the one common factor in all those failures*. 

&gt; **6. Goat rape.**

Nah, fooling. Well, maybe. 

&gt; **6. He shows his kinky side.**

&gt; As you and your guy get closer, you may not be having as much sex, but you can definitely have much better sex. ...when your man feels tight with you, 

Not the best choice of slang, there, either.

&gt; So don't judge or reject him when he does bring up some new erotic ideas. Of course, you don't have to indulge him either. But be gentle when you turn him down. Simply saying something like, ""That just doesn't turn me on"" should suffice. Then you can counter his suggestion with one of your own. It will help ease any discomfort he might feel about being shot down, and you will probably get what you want in bed as well. 

So. shoot him down and immediately use his guilt at having some shameful fetish to push him to indulge your own? 

&gt; Even if you don't turn him down, communicating your desires will improve your lust life...and boost your bond. 

THEY USED THE C WORD!

Eugh, not much to be said about these. This is normal relationship stuff. Hell, half of it is normal *people* stuff.

Not every night is the night of your 5th date, when everyone still does their best to impress and no one farts. It's not ""strange"", not even ""kinda strange"". And the scary thing? IT HAPPENS BOTH WAYS! He's not talking as much about himself? NEITHER ARE YOU! He wants time for himself? SO DO YOU! There will be less, but more relaxed sex. There will be more ""alone time"". There will be more verbal shorthand and less need to provide biographical info. Occasionally your personalities will clash because you are not photocopies of each other. In essense, there comes a point where both of you stop being ""a stranger who's got a stranglehold on your hormones"" and start being *friends*. 

If you are both NOT doing these things, there is something wrong somewhere. "	t5_2w1fs	True

**Wanted**: a restaurant with good food, dim lighting, a table in the back with a long tablecloth… and inattentive service so my boyfriend can attempt to give me a ***Big O*** without the waiter realizing it.

But alas, when one searches for this on Google Maps, nothing comes up. So after **pounding** the pavement for one *week* straight, D. and I finally found a restaurant with so-so food, dim lighting, and a table in the back… unfortunately without a long tablecloth. 

It wasn't perfect, but I had to complete the challenge. **Who knew that of all the things Cosmo has tasked me with, this would be one of the most difficult?** 

In preparation for the evening, I had put on a loose mini dress and gone commando. I had also packed something in my bag. A ""***cleansing***"" wipe. *New York City heatwave + traipsing around said city sans skivvies = the need for a cleansing wipe*. 

After sitting down in a booth in the back, D. and I sussed out our surroundings. If we sat on the same side of the booth and he sort of leaned forward and lifted his legs a little, he could get a hand between my legs without anyone noticing (fingers crossed). I hit the bathroom, got myself in tip-top shape then walked back to the table, taking in the view. Yikes, **people would see.** Not necessarily my business. **But that funny business was happening.** 

I relayed this to D. 

""If there were no chance of being caught, it wouldn't be interesting,"" he said. 

**""You're finger blasting me in a crowded restaurant in Manhattan. I don't think we need the entire clientele watching to make this interesting.""**

But he had a point. The idea was that we could get caught at any moment. **That's supposed to make it extra-hot, right?** 

We ordered drinks, I chugged half of mine, and turned to D. ""Let's do this."" 

*He let out a little squeal* and I immediately chastised him for making a scene. D. promised to keep a straight face and even used his left hand to pick up his drink while his right hand reached for my thigh. As soon as he got under my skirt and was touching my upper thigh, I **giggled**. *Loudly*. The booth in front of us turned around. ^Whoooops. 

After I calmed myself down, D. tried again. I strategically placed my napkin over the area, he hiked my dress up and **went for *it***. 

He *jabbed* his hand in the general right direction, but kept hitting the area above my clitoris. 

""Enough meetings on my mound,"" I said. ""Move an inch south."" 

***I'm pretty sure the granny two tables away knew exactly what I was talking about. But she seemed to approve.*** 

D. contorted his hand and managed to get to the bullseye. And ladies, let me tell you,* I got turned on right away.* I didn't expect to since I had been so nervous and wired. He rubbed my button using two fingers and since I couldn't make a peep, I just put on this **goofy** grin while trying to look really busy with other things. Nothing going on here. Just taking a sip of my wine. Why, no, my boyfriend's hand is not up my skirt, I'm simply eating a forkful of salad like one does at a restaurant. 

And then suddenly our lovely server was coming at us. 

""Stopstopstopstopserveriscomingserveriscomingserveriscoming,"" I said, panicked. 

*""Well, that wasn't my goal. But I'm glad someone is."" *
D. slid his hand back to his own lap. I don't think the server noticed. 

This happened, oh, four more times, and I became convinced—conspiracy theory style—that the entire restaurant staff knew what was going on. I swore the busboy was smirking at us, I was sure the chef who came out to talk to the hostess only did so to get a look at my spread knees, and I would have put money on the fact that our server was texting the rest of the people in the kitchen, ""**U have to come see this!**"" 

We decided to wait till our main course was served to avoid being caught red-*handed* again. Once our dishes were on the table, I leaned back in the booth and spread my legs slightly. D. came up with a totally new manual stimulation technique: his palm is facing down and he makes a loose fist so that his knuckles are aimed at me. He spreads the knuckles on his pointer and middle finger a fraction of an inch and places them around my clitoris. He rubs up and down and side to side. (I don't know if you can imagine it, but the parts of those two fingers below the knuckle were laying flat against my labia as he worked my button.) **[Ah. Mah. Zing.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTQvnhNVgxQ)** It felt really different than when he uses the tips of his fingers, plus he also covered so much more ground. 

***Unfortch***, our server was way too attentive for D. to bring me to climax. (If you try this challenge, go to a restaurant where the server will leave you alone for 20 minutes.) But as soon as D. and I got back to my apartment, he threw me down on the bed, lifted up my dress completely and went to town. I was so primed from all of that foreplay that I orgasmed in what might have been record time. I attribute it to him using his patented new move—*I’ve been referring to it as the Knuckle Ball, but that feels utterly unsexy.* Any ideas for a better name?

Aesthetically, hygienically, and for the sanity of women everywhere – YES, a left-up toilet seat is the **most offensive, irritating faux pas a man can possibly make.** Akin to being caught in the rain, pouring the crumby bits of your cereal into your bowl, hearing a knife scraping a plate...  Ok, you get the picture. 

First of all, it’s *usually* disgusting. It actually glares at you with its splashes round the rim, (among other offensive things...) Nope, it’s not something I want to touch, even with a toilet paper glove. Returning the seat to its natural position is just good manners. It’s totally reasonable to ask your man to be considerate and pop down the lid. Yes, you can argue why should he have to put it down but if (heaven forbid), he’s made the seat less than peachy clean, then he should DEFO be the one having to deal with it.

Plus, it just looks nicer. As Web Editor Pat correctly pointed out, you don’t see the toilet seat left up in a bathroom showroom. (I was being serious when I said that left-up lid glares at you.)

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for compromise here. One staffer’s friend has a rule where the lid and seat have to be replaced, so everyone has to touch something, thus averting WWIII. This seems like a pretty fair deal. Perhaps this is something to suggest next time you get the rage when you see the throne with its lid up. And breeeathe. 


&gt;**Deputy Features Editor, Rosie Mullender, says it’s time to step away from the toilet (figuratively speaking)**

Right. Ladies. It’s 2012. We’re facing the collapse of the global economy, mass unemployment, the battle to close the pay gap, endless pressures to be perfect and the prospect of The Voice being re-commissioned. Yet still – still – we care about whether a guy puts the loo seat down?

Admittedly, I feel a slight **twinge of annoyance if a man leaves it up**. It doesn’t look pretty, and we’ve all had it drummed into us by our mums to leave it down.

But the main argument against it seems to be, ‘Why should I have to touch the seat?’ Well, why should he? Why isn’t the rule that women have to put it down, then lift it afterwards? As someone who has worked as a cleaner in university halls, I can confirm that w**hen men live alone, they basically just go everywhere, like a fire hose** – so frankly, we should be grateful that they bother to lift the seat at all.

A quick straw poll round the office almost resorted into actual **fisticuffs*** breaking out on top of photocopier. Cosmo’s Web Editor, Pat, sees it as a metaphor for a man’s entire inner landscape – **if he’s selfish in the bathroom, it’ll probably extend to the rest of his life, and he’ll be shown the door.** While our Features Director, Fiona, isn’t bothered either – but admits to leaving all her kitchen cupboards open, which is basically the girl equivalent.

It’s clearly a contentious issue. But if your man is funny, kind, interesting, thoughtful and sexy (and if not, why are you with him?), I really don’t see why a loo seat should be capable of causing so much kerfuffle. In fact, I’d probably let a man like that leave the kitchen cupboards open, too.

1358064023.0	16hfbs	So, everyone knows men are animals. Well heres how to train your boyfriend. 	leeceia	27	5	4	"Taken, word for word, from http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/relationship-advice/train-boyfriend

That’s why Cosmo uncovered time-tested methods used by the most successful animal trainers on the planet. Then we got top psychologists to show you how to apply those techniques to your guy. Read on and you will soon be able to teach him some new tricks.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 1: He’s Allergic to Chores**
Indulge His Playfulness

**As Used on Chimpanzees**
These primates are big mischief makers, so getting them to calm down can be a real bitch. Luckily, if you indulge their silly side, you have a good shot at getting them to pay attention. “When we need the chimps to perform a task, we get on their level and play with them for 5 or 10 minutes,” says Eugene Cussons, rescue director on Animal Planet’s Escape to Chimp Eden. Once they’ve had some fun, they’re more willing to heed commands because they instinctively know it’s their turn to return the favor.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
No matter how old they are, men never quite lose touch with the playful, naughty boy within. Too bad they often pick the worst times to bring out that brat — like when you’re running late for work or need them to do something around the house. To get what you need done, “indulge him with a few minutes of acting goofy,” says Anthony Riche, PhD, author of Finally! How to Stop Dating Losers Forever. Then tell him you’ll finish playing with him later, as long as he takes out the trash or does whatever else you need him to do. Since his mind and body are now surging with feel-good chemicals from your brief, fun exchange, he’s less likely to wrinkle his nose at the request, says Riche. Use this technique consistently and, over time, he’ll be less likely to associate chores with drudgery.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 2: He Lacks Social Graces**
Reward the Good, Ignore the Bad

**As Used on Dogs**
Pretraining, a pup will sniff crotches and paw at people’s legs. The instinct is to shoo it away, but that only makes it want to sniff and paw more. “Instead, trainers reward the dog when it behaves and ignore any actions they don’t like,” says Sutherland. Since dogs crave affection, they slowly begin to avoid bad habits and opt for good ones.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Perhaps your man could use some finessing when it comes to social situations too — say, to curb his habit of telling off-color jokes. When he engages in unseemly behavior, your immediate reaction might be to tell him to knock it off already. But that tactic invariably falls on deaf ears.

“Men don’t want to be treated like children, and if you correct him, he’ll feel like you’re mothering him,” says Patricia Covalt, PhD, author of What Smart Couples Know. Instead, ignore him when he’s being obnoxious, and give him some PDA (think a kiss or a tap on the butt) when he’s acting sweet. Since guys — like dogs — aim to please, he’ll instinctively begin to avoid the behavior that makes you freeze him out. One caveat: Timing is crucial. Be sure to reward him at the exact moment he engages in a positive behavior; otherwise, he won’t be able to make the appropriate connection.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 3: He Bolts When You Argue**
Keep a Cool Head

**As Used on Horses**
Beneath the powerful stallion exterior lies a skittish animal. “That’s why they generally respond well to a calming voice and touch from trainers,” says Patricia Barlow-Irick, PhD, equine-behavior specialist in New Mexico.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Like horses, men seem to be hardwired to want to bolt at the first sound of irritation. So even if he’s been working your last nerve, try to approach him in a cool, collected manner (remember, as hard as it sounds, this is all going to benefit you in the end). For instance, if you are pissed that he hasn’t been planning enough date nights or can’t stand when he forgets to call while he’s out, your instinct might be to yell or get huffy. Instead, keep your composure by taking a few minutes alone before you approach him, then speak in a quiet, even-toned voice. “Calmly telling him what he did wrong will make it easier for him to tune in to what you’re saying,” says Covalt. Touch also plays a crucial role in this scenario: Place your hand on his as you speak. Not only does this buffer the blow of your words, but it also mimics the comforting way a trainer strokes a horse’s mane to calm the animal down.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 4: He Stands His Ground**
Use Proper Body Language

**As Used on Cougars**
When trainers want a cougar to bend to their will, they find a middle ground. “Instead of trying to submit or dominate a cougar, trainers try to form a cooperative relationship,” says Sutherland. They walk tall with squared-off shoulders. This stance ensures that the trainers don’t look like prey but they’re not threatening either.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
Even the most liberated guy can feel emasculated by a fearless chick. So when you’re having a sticky conversation with him, he might be unconsciously bristling at your body language. “If you’re standing really close to him with your hands on your hips and your feet wide apart, he’ll get defensive and instinctively want to fight back,” says body-language expert Patti Wood, author of Success Signals. Similarly, if you stand meekly and tilt your head while talking to him, he might take it as a sign that you’re too submissive. “The best way to stay on equal ground is to stand with good posture, your head up, and an open frame so he sees you as being on the same level as he is. This way, he’ll be more apt to want to talk things through with you,” says Wood.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 5: He Won’t Drag His Ass Off the Couch**
Approach Him at the Right Time

**As Used on Lions**
Lions are, in a word, lazy. According to trainers, they sleep for up to 20 hours a day and only move when they see it as beneficial to themselves. “Trying to get a lion to do something when it’s in resting mode can be very difficult and even dangerous,” says lion wrangler Dave Salmoni, host of Animal Planet’s After the Attack. “That’s why we make use of the animal’s active time instead of trying to force it into doing something it doesn’t want to when it’s chilling.”

**Apply It to Your Guy**
A man in veg-out mode is unlikely to move his rear no matter how much you try to engage him. “You have to gauge when he’s in a productive mood and then pounce to get him to do what you want,” says Riche. If you notice that he prefers working out in the morning, that’s a good time to ask him to help you clean when he’s finished. If you need something done during his downtime and don’t want to wait, bribe him. “Motivate him by making it worth his while,” says Riche. When you feel like you haven’t been able to have a heart-to-heart but he’s in a coma in front of the TV, try plying him with his favorite snack. If his cravings for the food outweigh his interest in the TV, he’ll eventually cave.

**BOYFRIEND BUMMER 6: He’s Not Romantic**
Take Baby Steps

**As Used on Elephants**
These mammals can learn a variety of tasks but only on an incremental time line. “A trainer would never expect an animal to learn something without teaching it how to do it,” says Sutherland. For example, if trainers want an elephant to paint as part of a circus act, they’ll first show the animal how to curl its trunk around the brush. Next, they’ll have it dip the brush into the paint. Only then would they show it how to create brush strokes. Animal trainers call this process of using small steps toward learning a new behavior successive approximations.

**Apply It to Your Guy**
The average guy is plenty romantic, but he’s not hardwired to plan out the little details. So if you can’t remember the last time he put together a sexy night in for you both, you’ll have to show him the way. Start by staging your apartment with cues that get you going, like candles and a sultry soundtrack. Have your favorite chilled wine on hand so you can ask him to open it before dinner. This creates a ritual in his mind. Eventually, not only will he get a sense of what your romantic needs are, but he’ll also start making a game plan of his own.

&gt;**If you're unsure of a comment that you want to make during a game, it's best not to say it**. Some women ask questions and make record-scratching comments causing all the guys to glance uneasily at one another. If you're not a sports fan, but you're attending the game, think of yourself as a first week employee in a business meeting.

If I can get my act together, anybody linking to the site will have the article they linked made into a screen cap for them and be sent the imgur link so they can repost and still get karma.
