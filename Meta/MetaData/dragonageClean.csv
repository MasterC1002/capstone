- ***[Kinlochhold Mods Her Game](http://kinlochhold.tumblr.com/post/50097911708/kinlochhold-mods-her-game-master-post)***

---

**Game Play and Environment**:

- [Improved Atmosphere](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/577) - Thanks /u/cirion5!
**Important Note**: Imrpoved Atmosphere can sometimes cause missing thumbnails. The fix for that can be found [here](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/826). Thanks to /u/Ganrao for pointing this out.
- [Dragon Age Redesigned](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/686) – Adds a lot of environmental changes, and updates some of the weirder faces in the game, as well as makes small changes to more accurately reflect events and dialogue. Several variants available.
- [Character Respecialization](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/14) - Adds a raven to most areas with free respec potions.
- [Lock Bash](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/301) - Bash through locks on chests and doors you can't pick.
- [No Helmet Hack](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/202) - Hide helmets for your party.
- [Beyond Ferelden Chest](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/61) - A storage chest for your party camp.
- [Sleeping Tent](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/735) – A tent for your Warden in camp. Note: This appears to spawn in the same location as the chest, which render one or both unusable. I would pick and choose between this mod and the Beyond Ferelden Chest.
- [Dalish Elves Beautified](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1343)
- [Skip the Fade](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/816) - Gives you all the same stat points, etc. All you have to do is run through the companion and final cutscenes/fights.
- [Forced Deathblows](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/220) - Because deathblows are awesome. Can also be used to turn off deathblows almost completely.
- [Auto-Loot](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/28) - Screw the dialogue box.
- [Dalish Mage Origin](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/764)
- [Dragon Age Class and Specialization Pack](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1399)
- [Awakening in the OC](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/920) - Adds the essential features of Awakening to the base game. I would **not** recommend this for beginners. It's very easy to mess up your game and likely has a slough of comparability issues.
- ***[Sleep Until Dawn](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3722)*** - Lets your Warden go to bed (including some interaction with your love interest), and creates a Dawn state for camp.
- ***[Beat the Hell out of Howe](http://social.bioware.com/project/3746/#files)*** - For all your Human Noble vengeance needs.

**Game Fixes** (There are many, but these are the ones I use):

- [Dialogue Tweaks](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/336) - Fixes some dialogue options that are slightly not contextually appropriate and adds in responses that should really be in the game, fixes some references.
- [Two Spec Sten](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/486) - Because he somehow only gets one Specialization point.
- [MADD Gift Guide](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/385) - Adds a notation of the intended companion for preferred gifts. Be warned: it spoils the identity of the Mystery Companion if you've never finished the game before.
- [Make Console Commands Visible](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1110) - Some mods and game bug fixes require you to type things into the console, but the console is naturally invisible, which causes some problems. This will let you see the console text. Make sure you also grab the linked fonts.erf file.
- [Advanced Tactics](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/181) - Fixes and deepens the tactics system.
- [Combat Tweaks](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/354) - Smooths out skills and makes them balanced. Makes some of the more terrible skills actually useful.
- [White Teeth](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/44) - Because some of the teeth textures are really distracting.
- [Symmetrical Massive Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/836) - This mod was actually made by our very own /u/svk151! Lets you pick one shoulder style and one glove style for the Massive armor.
- ***[Effects Handler](http://social.bioware.com/project/2715/)*** - Includes quite a few handy tweaks and removes effects out of combat.

**Extended Gameplay**:

- ***[Baldur's Gate II Redux](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1836)*** - Irenicus' Dungeon from Baldur's Gate II. Huge, amazing mod.
- ***[Alley of Murders](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/615)*** - ""Experience the dangerous underbelly of Denerim's streets by investigating a series of murders that will see you battle thieves, murderers, darkspawn and more.""
- ***[Dark Times - Act I](http://social.bioware.com/project/2157/)*** - ""A search for a cure to the eventual death sentence that comes as a result of the Joining leads the Grey Warden to the Confederacy of Malkuth, a loose collection of city states which exists south of Ferelden, beyond the Uncharted Territories."" NOTE: This is a torrent file, you will need a program to open it, such as [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/). Look for the required file under the ""Files"" tab, labeled 
Torrent Dark Times Act One v1_07.rar
- ***[Quests and Legends](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/2040/)*** (Thanks /u/Shabutaro!) - HUGE game extension, and apparently extremely well done, including full voice acting.


**Create A Character Enhancement**:

- [Bidelle's Cosmetics](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/473)
- [Vibrant Colors](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/153) - Adds a ton more colors for hairstyles and eyes, as well as a bright white tattoo color that kinda glows. 
- [Eyebrow Presets](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1321)
- [Tucked Hair](http://social.bioware.com/project/2595/) - Most vanilla hairstyles, now tucked behind the ears.
- [LOTC Hairstyle Collection](http://social.bioware.com/project/3766/) - You can see some images under ""discussions.""
- [Anto Hairstyles](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3480)
- [Hairstyle Day](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3552)
- [More Hairstyles](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/392)
- [Don't Worry, Be Hairy](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/555)
- [Beautiful People Hair REN](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/750)

**Armor**:

- [The Phoenix Armory for Females](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1660) - Has some game-breaking stats and are available extremely early on, but it has three levels of stats (including a very limited set available at Ostagar). And, they're lovely. Females only.
- [Dusk Mage Robes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/589) - Again, game-breaking stats, though there is a version with milder stats, they're still pretty over powered.
- [Ivory Tower and Nightfall Bloom](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/645) - For your Arcane Warrior.
- [Underworld Armory](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1533) - Adds some more armors to the game, armor models originally from an Oblivion mod.
- [The Witcher Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1876)
- ***[The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3838/?)***
- [Wings of Velvet Mage Robes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/712) - Thanks /u/cirion5!
- [HSLI Sexy Mage Robes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1342) (**NSFW**) - These are not lore friendly, but some people really like these, and they are very well animated. 
- [HSLI Sexy Outfits](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3369) (**Semi-NSFW**) - More lore friendly (but not by much).
- [HSLI Revenant Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1846) - Allows you to wear Revenant Armor. Semi-NSFW version available.
- [HSLI Darkspawn Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1791) - Allows you to wear Darkspawn armor. SFW.


**Companion and NPC Appearance Tweaks** (there are MANY but these are my favorites):

- [Sacred Ashes Companions](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/463) - Updates Morrigan, Leliana, and/or Sten to more closely resemble their appearance in the Sacred Ashes trailer.
- [Morrigan Sacred Ashes Robes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1902) - Replaces Morrigan's armor with her kickass trailer armor. Especially useful if you're not a fan of her vanilla, cleavage-heavy robes, but want to keep her looking unique.
- [DA2 Flemeth and Isabela in DA:O](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/2636) - If you are bothered by the huge redesign they did on these characters but prefer the DA2 models, or just want some consistency.
- [Armor of the Devout](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1018) - New armor specific to Leliana available at the site of Andraste's Ashes, with an extra, similar set for Zevran or your rogue PC.
- [Leliana's Sacred Ashes Trailer Armor](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1444)
- [Armor of the Sten](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1185) - Special armor for Sten, found in Lothering.
- [Tranquil Tattoos](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3643/) - Replicates the forehead tattoos present on Tranquil mages in DAII.
- [DA2 Style Qunari in DA:O](http://social.bioware.com/project/4592/) - Works on Sten, too.
- ***[Grey Wardens of Ferelden](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3258/)*** - Replaces the armor of every Grey Warden in the game with a class appropriate version of the Grey Warden armor from DA2, and spawns a class-appropriate set in your inventory upon joining the Wardens. It even changes the armor of every warden in the Soldier's Peak DLC. Extremely well done, but as far as I can tell, all the armor is low level. **There are also weapons in this mod.**

**New Companion**:

- [Ser Gilmore NPC](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/851) - Someone went through and completely fleshed out Ser Gilmore from the Human Noble origin to make him a companion. It's not voiced by the same actor for the rest of the game, but the sheer effort required is amazing.
- [Ser Gilmore for Awakening](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3210) is also available. With continuity.
- [Karmas Origins Companions](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1617) - Lets you recruit pretty much anyone, ever.

**Dog**:

- [Extra Dog Slot](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/664) - Adds your dog as a permanent, summonable companion, much like in DA2. Makes the game a bit easier.
- **[Dog Gifts Tweak](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/635/)** - Dog's approval is pretty much stuck at +100, making gifts useless. This mod makes each gift add stats instead.
- **[Mabari Recolors](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/2981/)** - Make your best friend fashion forward.
- **[Extended Dog Talents](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1361/)** - When you reach a high enough level, you run out of talents for Dog. Now you won't.

**Romance Expansions** (Note: by romance I don't mean the sex cut scenes, I mean more meaningful interactions and extended story points):

- [Extended Zevran Romance](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/2054) - Lots of small extended scenes.
- [Extended Alistair Romance](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1166) - More small scenes, including a special scene for each origin. Very sweet.
- [First Night with Alistair](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1420)
- [More visible Alistair kiss](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1549) - Because seriously... his armor is huge.
- [Cullen Romance Option](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1949) - A very well done mod, if you wanted to follow up on hitting on Cullen as a mage. Adds a scene when you first see him, when you leave, and during Broken Circle.
- [Free Love](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/127) - Allows females to romance Morrigan, though be warned: she will refer to your character with male pronouns, and she will still proposition you for the dark ritual, allowing you to lesbian conceive. Also allows for males to romance Alistair, but again, he will refer to you with female pronouns. This affects party banter, too.
- [Polygamey](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/259) - Allows you to romance anyone and everyone (this is all four available romances, if you use the previous mod). No jealousy. Allows the threesome/foursome with Isabela, even if companions aren't hardened.
- ***[Alistair's Nightmare](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3723)*** - This is a companion mod for Sleep Until Dawn, and requires that mod for this to work. Adds an extremely well done cutscene to the game, triggered after certain conditions are met.

**Romance Expansions continued (Spoilers for ending)** (Thanks to /u/ItamiOzanare for formatting help):

- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1839)  [Royal Wedding - For all your female human noble needs.](/spoiler)
- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1985) [Zevran Wedding - For Dalish elves only, for now.](/spoiler)
- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1077)  [Gate Kisses - Especially good way to say goodbye to your romances if you're going to go fall on your sword.](/spoiler)
- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3597)  [Funeral Kiss - Extends the PC's funeral, if you romanced Alistair and made him king.](/spoiler)
- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/3368) [Alistair Funeral - If you decide to sacrifice Alistair.](/spoiler)
- [Link](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1611) [The Dark Ritual - I will note that I don't think this one is good enough at their dialogue pulling, but it's still the best version of this scene I've found, a scene that I felt was sorely missing from the game. There is a video of the scene available on the download page, and it's pretty easy to find on YouTube as well.](/spoiler)


**Naked people (All links NSFW)**:

- [Natural Bodies](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/554)

**Edited or Extended Sex Scenes (All links NSFW)**:

- [Milder Romance Scenes](http://social.bioware.com/project/2418/) - Yes, these make the sex scenes *less* explicit.
- [Special ""first time"" cut scene for Alistair](http://social.bioware.com/project/2874/)
- [Many flavors of extended/kinkier sex scenes](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/548) - Fairly well animated, if you're into that.
- [Rendezvous at the Tavern](http://dragonage.nexusmods.com/mods/1587) - Again this is a lot kinkier. Adds a rather remarkable number of new, fully animated and dialogued sex scenes available at The Pearl. "	t5_2r8lo	True

I don't think it was nearly as polished, and felt a bit rushed. But overall, I liked Hawke, and I liked the combat. The story had its higher points, but it could have been an over all better game. So I was fine with most reviews of it at about 8.5. So I seem to see two spectrums on the game, some love it, but a lot hate its existence. Why do you like, or dislike Dragon age 2?	t5_2r8lo	True

[Spoilers]	officerbigmac	119	36	64	"I understand that there was too much recycled environments, but for the most part, I thought it was a great, game, especially the story telling. After finishing the game, I actually felt almost the same degree of ""separation anxiety"" I that tend to get for games like DA:O or the Mass Effect series.

The story-line was amazing, the Mage-Templar issue captured my attention and had me conflicted until the very end. The parts where Hawke's mother dies by Quentin and Anders becoming a terrorist (can't believe I didn't realize that he was technically an abomination until it was too late) ultimately lead me to side with the templars... but in the end, I still didn't feel like there was ""right choice"".

Combat wise, I didn't mind the continuous waves of enemies. As a DW rogue, I just learnt to conserve my cooldowns and only use it at the right times. My only complaint is nightmare mode being too ridiculous with the friendly fire damages. Ex. I can't seem to bring Fenris along without him 1HKO almost any other melee party members in game, even Aveline.

Events like zombie mom dying and sibling getting kidnapped actually made me feel quite angry and furious at the in-game NPCs. Overall, in my opinion, if I game can make me experience such emotions, it must've been a pretty good game."	t5_2r8lo	True

1. The combat. I love the tactics system. I love pausing and deciding what the party member will do. I am not good at combat in other games; it tends to move too quickly for me to think. This allows time for me to breathe and decide what I want to do next!

2. I love the NPC personalities - they seem so fully realized and interesting. Also the party banter is so fun.

3. I love the art style. I have modded it up some with better textures but I loved the way the game looked without it - now it just looks better.

4. I love the Origins. I played the Mage one, it was meh...but loved the Dwarf Origins. They were both so cool. In fact, I just dig the Dwarves, period.


I've not played through the whole game, only gotten as far as Ostagar in my game and watched some LPs of a bit more of the game, but have not seen the ending or much of the story. Really looking forward to diving in.

I am doing a Let's Play of this game - my love note to it I suppose - just posted the first few episodes today. I am a storyteller and **deep** roleplayer so this is right up my alley. 

Here's the [first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WzaDu_DsH8&amp;list=PLvwrEqwe9aSXze4woQaJckc54_UASKFvp&amp;index=1). I am hoping to receive lots of tips and tricks from smart DA players in comments. "	t5_2r8lo	True

Self post - no karma. Please feel free to upvote for visibility.

As said, I spent a few hours coming up with a survey for the choices you make in the games. Personally I was wondering how the Reddit community played the games, so I had been planning on doing this quite some time ago.

[Link to the survey](https://qtrial.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_1XHUJvm4jCaQuvb)

The survey has 56 questions, so it should take you about 10 minutes to answer it completely. Due to lack of lasting decisions in DA2, the majority of questions is about DA:O, so don't worry about the size of the second page. 

Depending on the reception I will deliver results after a significant number has answered it (I'm guessing about 100 should be sufficient) or if the post is a week old (That would be Tuesday, the 23rd of October), whatever takes longer. 

Also, feel free to post the survey to non-redditor friends and family!

EDIT: Thanks for the amount of submissions! The survey is now roughly 24 hours old, and 205 people have already answered it. I honestly didn't think it'd go so quickly. In accordance with my plans for the weekend (and to be fair towards those who don't visit this subreddit daily) I'll keep the post up until Sunday morning of GMT and spend my lazy Sunday summing up the results. If everything goes well, you Americans will be able to spend your hangover over some pretty graphs."	t5_2r8lo	True

First I will have to apologize for an inconvenience. When I opened up Qualtrics today I saw that 305 people had answered the survey, and that Qualtrics had suspended viewing the results until I fork over 2500$. Luckily I had an old tab from yesterday still opened on my tablet, so I had insight to the answers of the first 243 people who answered. If you posted some time after yesterday afternoon I'm afraid your answers aren't represented in the graphs, sorry for that. Also the graphs aren't that pretty as hoped, I had to use a web-based program as lifesaver.

[So without further ado, here's the album with the relevant questions.](http://imgur.com/a/SUo9r)

Note that I did not include some questions of the survey, in this case responses were nearly 100% towards one answer. 

Reading through the comments was pretty interesting. The points frequently brought up were:

* Return of old characters (Alistair and Morrigan were specificially requested several times, wheras Oghren was specifically excluded).

* A polished game; no repeated dungeons, better character shaping etc.

* Story-wise the hivemind wants to go back to how things were in Origins, regarding combat it sways more towards the faster DA2 style.

* More character interactions, better romances including sex scenes and post-coital continuation of them, the ability to dress them, ideas like a Chasind character were brought up.

* Decisions should weigh more again and actually affect the story ending.

* Less plot devices, you should be able to actually avoid certain things.

* Hawke and the Warden need to make a reappearance.

* Possibility to interrupt conversations like in Mass Effect.

If you still have questiones feel free to ask!

FillionMyMind	81	21	41	"I should note that I'm new to Dragon Age, and just plowed through both games over the last two weeks. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of both games!

Origins was great stuff, don't get me wrong. I've heard comparisons to Baldur's Gate, but since I haven't played that, I found the game reminiscent of Star Wars: KOTOR in all of the best ways possible. I loved the characters and the scale of the world, the writing was excellent, the gameplay was challenging, and there was so much to see and do! I thought the graphics could have been better from a technical perspective, the plot was somewhat simple, and a game ending glitch almost made me give up (my Xbox kept freezing on the Archdemon fight :( ), but overall I had a great time playing it!

Dragon Age 2 is obviously a very different beast, but I thought it made a lot more improvements than it got credit for. I thought the narrative setup was a lot more intriguing, and I liked how everything came together at the end. The combat might not have been as deep per se, but I thought it was a lot more gratifying. It was fast, flashy, and fun, and I liked how some of the mechanics were streamlined with potion and poison making. Spending hours in the Tactics screen felt great because I could almost play it as fast paced action game (I know it's not what many of the fans wanted, but I appreciated it!) The characters were just about as good as Origins in my opinion. Merrill is one of my new favorite characters, Varric was hilarious throughout (I loved his nicknames for your squadmates), and even characters I didn't care for at first grew on me quite a bit by the end (Anders and Aveline in particular). The only thing that almost did it in for me was the repetition. I had read complaints all over the internet about how Bioware reused mansion, dungeon, underground, and outdoor layouts throughout the game, but I had no idea they were reused THAT much. I saw that stupid dock hideout and outdoor cave system more times than I could count, and I'd get ticked every time a rock wall was mysteriously blocking off the door in a cave I had just been in a little while ago. Although I liked the idea of the city and day/night cycles, it got a little long in the tooth for me after a while as well. In the end though, I loved the new things DA2 had to offer, and I'm glad I got to experience it after the ""hate train"" stop rolling. I imagine this place was as bad as r/masseffect was after ME3's ending started getting attention.

Tl;dr: I loved what both games had to offer, and I'm now eagerly anticipating Dragon Age 3!"	t5_2r8lo	True

Edit. It seems like having a voice actor was a big hit for most people. I am also wondering what is the most hated thing about da2 for you guys. Just one thing in general that you guys think they could have done better with a little more time. For me it is most likely having different dungeons, instead of the same building over and over again. "	t5_2r8lo	True

I guess I'm asking if anyone whilst roleplaying on the templar side of things has ever felt it was really the better or morally more acceptable option.

This may be due to the fact that I really enjoyed playing as a mage, and they are by far the most powerful class in the game for any group to have. It's very common to come to the conclusion your best party would be Rogue/Warrior/Magex2.

Apart from that it always seemed to me that the templars are portrayed consistently as overzealous 'captors'. Looking at your party from DA:O you have a cynical ex-templar, an apostate, the player-character who could be a mage, and an elder mage who has a spirit inhabit her.

I think my first playthrough of these games being a mage Warden/Hawke and generally being diplomatic and heroic has made it unlikely for me to actively help the templars in the coming war.

“Spending too much time there starts to make me feel negative- not just about the games we make, but about myself and life in general,

1339870696.0	v59wm	A word of hope for Dragon Age 3	Antrix32	54	11	41	"As we all know, there are many who were less than satisfied with Dragon Age 2, the successor to a game that, most agree, was a fine addition to the genre, and was indeed a spiritual successor to games like Baldurs gate and Icewind dale.

what was the reason for this decline in quality? simply put, it was the time it took to make each game. Dragon Age origins began development in 2004, and was released in 2009, a total of 6 year, with atleast 3 or 4 dedicated to post concepts, and actual development of the game engine. 

Dragon age 2 started development in late 2009, and was finished late 2010, and released early 2011. This is a total of 1-2 years of development, with an estimated *one year* of work on the actual engine. This is obviously a drastic decline in time of development, and the results show.

Some blame EA for the time restraints, and maybe there right. But there is hope. 

Dragon age 3 started development approximately slightly before, and slightly after, the release of Dragon age 2. This was in march 2011. It is already March 2012, and there has yet to be an official announcement, and only rumors, speculation, and minor details. 

In fact, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said that Dragon Age III is expected to be released time in 2014. This would be a total of 4 years development time. This is *quadruple* the time it took to finish Dragon age 2, and almost as long as it took  to finish origins. 

With much of the lore already set down, and the engine already built, 4  years is more than enough time to build properly structured game, that could go back to the quality of Origins. 

Many people dont want to get their hopes up..i can see why. But I for one, am exited to see where Dragon age 3 goes. Companions are getting equipment again, the game wont take place in one city, possibilities of multiplayer...I'm defiantly anxious to see where this goes"	t5_2r8lo	True

1358548716.0	16udsw	So, the lyrium idol. And dwarves. Wall of text.	Vyralas	47	5	36	"FIRST OF ALL. SPOILERS. If I have to tag everything I'll basically turn half the text black.

Alright. I checked if this has been asked before and I didn't find anything which I found surprising.

I wanted to talk/ask what you think about... the idol. Made out of red lyrium. First of all why does it have such power and normal lyrium doesn't? Why has something like this never been mentioned so far until Hawk stumbles upon the idol? I had to go to the wiki to find a bit more information on it. We all know the story of Bartrand and Meredith going insane due to being in contact with it BUT the main thing I wanted to ask/talk about is its' ability to animate objects or statues as it is in DA2. What do you think about it?

After some time and one and a half playthroughs of DA2 I suddenly remembered what Caridin once said: To animate his golems he needed souls of living creatures. I was curious about this because apparently this red, ""Primeval"" lyrium completely ignores that fact which to me speaks of power FAR greater than that of normal lyrium. It grants Meredith amazing powers which she can control almost effortlessly even though she isn't a mage. She easily does sky-high leaps and brings alot of statues back to life. What bugged me is that ACCORDING TO THE WIKI... it was KNOWN that this form of lyrium grants great powers yet nobody tried to find any of it. Even after Caridin found that he needs souls to make his golems, even during that golden age and so many dwarves were sacrificed noone thought of the option to maybe go and find some red lyrium to end this. Yes I read the ""at the cost of their sanity."" part but if you can figure out how to strap a soul to a rock you can most likely figure out how NOT to lose your sanity while using the primeval lyrium. WIKI:

&gt; *It is known to give its user supernatural abilities at the cost of their sanity.It also seems to greatly enhance any magical abilities in its possessor, for example granting the ability to animate inanimate objects such as statues, and the power of limited flight.*

I also had... another idea: What if... the magisters of Tevinter actually used THIS kind of lyrium to get to the golden/black city? Seeing what such a small idol could do, imagine a large quantity in the hands of the most powerful mages at that time - the Tevinter magisters?

I also really wanted to give an explanation to the ""singing"" Bartrand was hearing but I've got nothing. I found it interesting because both Bartrand and the Mother who were insane referred to some sort of ""song"" which they craved to hear again. But I'm dry. Maybe I'm just trying to turn the nothing into something. Ideas? I love reading people's opinions here... well most of them.

**TL;DR:** Okay, fine. Half of you won't read that wall of text anyway.
It was known that red lyrium is super powerful, why wasn't it researched at all?
Could the magisters at Tevinters have used the red lyrium to get into the golden/black city?

WHEW. Redditing is hard.

Not sure if there were any rules to predictions or speculation, but after completing Dragon Age 2, I wanted to make some speculations for the future of Dragon Age.

WARNING: Wall of Text, large use of spoiler tags, and desperate attempts at making everything make sense.

tl;dr: Shits about to go down, and the Seeker is going to be a central part of fixing it


At the end of DA: O, the Warden, and party [slay the Archdemon](/spoiler), according to a survey made about a month ago [the vast majority of players had their Warden survive](/spoiler), (link to survey will be in comments). 

Regardless of the battle against the Archdemon, the player will assume the role of Warden-Commander of Ferelden in Awakening. During the player's quest in the Amaranthine arling, s/he encounters the Architect, [a sentient darkspawn, with great plans for his race](/spoiler). His plans have already been seen with [Mother, and the Disciples, sentient darkspawn, created by using the blood of Grey Wardens](/spoiler), and during the Final Battle of Awakening, it is revealed that [the Architect attempted to slay the Archdemon of the Fifth Blight, before the blight could begin, but instead quickened the process, causing the Fifth Blight to happen](/spoiler). It is to be believed regardless of the actions of the Warden-Commander against the [Architect](/spoiler) that some of his [Disciples still live, helping to give other darkspawn sentience](/spoiler). I'll explain the importance of this later on.

At the end of Witch Hunt [the player has a number of ways to deal with Morrigan, either following her through the Eluvian, or ""killing"" her](/spoiler). Both actions could be responsible for the Warden's [sudden disappearance](/spoiler), whether through the obvious, or through grief, as they come to terms with [Morrigan's fate](/spoiler)

Without further ado, let's move onto Dragon Age 2, including Legacy DLC:

When the dust settles from the actions of Hawke in Act 3 of DA2, we discover that [Two seekers are currently searching for the Hero of Ferelden, and Hawke (Leliana and Cassandra Pentaghast, respectively)](/spoiler). With the [Mage/Templar War](/spoiler) in it's opening stages, the possibility of the Fade being torn open all across Thedas is possible [as observed in the Blackmarsh in Awakening](/spoiler). 

Finally we move onto Sandal, sweet, adorable, innocent Sandal. Whose importance may not even be recognized by the Chantry. After Hawke moves into his/her estate in Act 2 of DA2, Sandal has something very dark to say (link to youtube clip will be in comments). Here is the largest part of the prophecy and maybe the most important [""One day the magic will come back. All of it. Everyone will be just like they were. The shadows will part, and the skies will open wide.""](/spoiler), Sandal seems to predict that long ago [everyone had magic, human, elf, even dwarf](/spoiler), the only major event that could possibly take the magic away was the [Tevintir Magisters entering the Golden City of the Maker, causing him to flee the city, turning it black, turning the Magisters into the first Darkspawn](/spoiler).

Now back to the [Architect, his disciples, and further events in the Dragon Age](/spoiler). I cannot remember who said it, if it was said at all, [but iirc someone or something talks of the terrible beauty of the Archdemons' song, and the way it draws in the darkspawn](/spoiler). With the [disciples, and Architect creating darkspawn free from the call of the Archdemons, it can be believed that the sound will be magnified to those who remain, giving them a larger desire to find the two remaining Archdemons, and along with the very possible escape of Corypheus, one of the first darkspawn,] (/spoiler). These combined factors make it look like that Thedas could experience one incredibly massive blight with [both Archdemons present](/spoiler), or maybe two (smaller) Blights happening in the Dragon Age.

So far, we know we'll be playing as a Seeker in DA3, sent to find someone of great importance [similar to what Leliana and Cassandra are doing during DA2](/spoiler). Who of great importance is currently unaccounted for that we, as the players know of? A few jump to mind, Flemeth, Maric [Alistair is currently searching for Maric as well, leading to my belief that Alistair could also being searched for](/spoiler), I should note that [I am, not counting the Hero or Hawke as both are already being searched for](/spoiler), and finally [Larius/Janeka](/spoiler), whoever the player sided with at the end of Legacy to discover the fate of [Corypheus, who may or may not have possessed one of the](/spoiler). I believe that the possibility of having a mission in the Deep Roads, where the player encounters members of the Legion of the Dead, who make note of the apparent lack of darkspawn, even in the areas they once had full control over. Further travelling into the Deeproads could bring the player in contact with a [sentient darkspawn](/spoiler) who believes that the Architect's plans are causing things to stir, deep beneath the Earth. This forces the player to warn the Chantry, and try to get peace between the warring [mages and templars, gain the aid of the Qunari, and cease tensions between Orlais and Ferelden](/spoiler).

In conclusion, I believe that we will see one, maybe two more games in the main series. DA3 will focus on getting every major character together, and DA4 will focus on the final, large conflicts of the Dragon Age."	t5_2r8lo	True

I've already cherry picked some of the most interesting tiddly-bits that I came across while reading. I'm currently halfway through the book and should be done by the time I wake up tomorrow to (hopefully) answer questions. Here are some interesting things I've learned:

* The Alamarri tribes that would eventually become Fereldans crossed the Frostback Mountains in -2415 Ancient, claiming to be fleeing a ""Shadow Goddess"". I wonder if this Shadow Goddess could be Flemeth?

* Intelligent, talking darkspawn like Corypheus and the Architect are first discovered in -191 Ancient. Corypheus is captured by the strangely named Grey Warden ""Sashamiri""- any guess as to what ethnicity someone with that name might be?

* Nevarra, which, despite its Spanish-sounding name, seems to be mostly inspired by Prussia (if we hold the other Free Marcher states to be similar to pre-Imperial German states, Nevarra becoming a nation and going to war with the setting's France-analogue marks it as Prussia) though with some Dutch influence (nobles have the word ""Van"" in their names, and their low-lying city of Cumberland has a somewhat Amsterdam feel) and strangely, Egyptian, because the nation mummifies their dead. A group mage-priests known as the Mortalitasi who originated with the Tevinter advisor to Nevarra's first king, preside over mummification of the dead and advising nobles of the nation, and they may or may not be necromancers, cultists or blood mages. Nevarran families often construct elaborate tombs for their dead and the ""Great Necropolis"" outside of Nevarra city is almost as large as the city itself.

* Seems like Antiva has some Arabic or Indian influence, at least in its names. One of its queens was ""Asha Subira Bahadur, Gana of Ayesleigh""- I've got no idea what ""Gana"" means in this context, if it's a made up word like ""teyrn"" or not.

* The island of Estwatch in the Amaranthine has a surprising amount of lore for something not mentioned before this book. Once a Tevinter stronghold, it was lost during the blight and has sat unclaimed by any single state for centuries, and is instead a haven for pirates in the mold of real-world Tortuga, along with Llomerryn. I get the feeling that it is either going to appear in DAIII or was intended to appear in the scrapped DAII expansion, what with DAII's focus on pirates through Isabela.

* Due to the close ties between the Dwarves and Tevinter Empires, dwarves in Tevinter have a very interesting position. The dwarves form a fifth social class in Tevinter all to their own (the other four being Atlus mages, mages who come from mage families that trace their lines back to the original dreamers, Laetan mages, mages who are born to nonmagical parents or otherwise non-ancient mage bloodlines, Soporati, the non-mage citizens, and slaves, with the subclass of freed slaves known as Liberati), the Ambassadoria. The dwarven embassy in Minrathous is considered one of the grandest structures in Thedas and all other Tevinter cities have a major dwarf embassy as well- most of the embassies are subterranean and so dwarves are not considered surfacers if they visit Tevinter, with some dwarves spending their entire lives within the embassy. All dwarves in the Imperium, even those who have been born there, are considered foreign dignitaries. The Ambassadoria has a body of representatives that acts as a lobby group to advise the Archon and negotiate lyrium trade.

* Par Vollen, now the center of Qunari society in Thedas, does have a native human population who seem to have willingly converted to the Qun. In the island's jungles, there are preserved and mathematically perfect pyramids aligned with the constitutions which have hieroglyphics that featured horned figures, leading some to speculate that these humans may have welcomed the Qunari as gods. This civilization may be the ""Fex"" Gaider alluded to in a PAX East interview ages ago.

* Gryphons are native to Seheron, according to Fog Warrior legends.

* Those who die in the service of the chantry in an exalted march are known as ""Exalted"" and receive a special place at the side of the maker according to the chantry. The ""Anointed"", those who have spent their whole lives in exceptional service to the chantry, are said to be by his hand. The only ""Anointed"" mentioned in the book so far is Cordilius Drakon, founder of the Andrastian Chantry and worshiped almost equally with Andraste within Orlais

* According to the book, the templar order is only ""mostly human"" and ""mostly male"". With Meredith Stannard providing an obvious exception to the ""male"" bit, it stands to reason that there are a handful of Elven Andrastian templars.

* There are both male and female priests in the Imperial Chantry, and they are allowed to wed and have children- though almost all Black Divines have been men, that doesn't rule out female Tevinter Grand Clerics or the like. Religious leadership is informally a family affair, much like Tevinter politics.

* Kal-Sharok does not recognize the king of Orzammar, and its head of state is the elected Paragon Elect, selected from their assembly not for great deeds as Orzammar's paragons, but great promises of what they will do when leading their people. Rather than get monumental statues, Kal-Sharok's paragons are honored with carvings."	t5_2r8lo	True

1311702047.0	j0c7o	Dragon Age 2: Legacy review	wseeg	47	8	25	"First of all let me say I really liked *Dragon Age: Origins*, and *Dragon Age 2*. I played *2* several times through and got a lot out of it.

Also, I think it's ridiculous but also necessary that I do this: I am in no way affiliated with BioWare/EA and am writing this review completely of my own opinion...

*Legacy* is the first quest based DLC for the widely panned *Dragon Age 2*. Priced at $10, I was able to complete the quest line in about four hours. It's pretty clear from the start that *Legacy* attempts to recapture some of the ""old magic"" from *DA:O*. Starting the DLC off is a little shaky... you approach a large warden statue in your house, they ask if you want to play *Legacy*, you pick your party and are all of the sudden in a desert. The DLC starts off a little slow and plain, seeming much like most quests in *2*. Once I got ""underground"", though, I found myself filled with the same awe from first heading into the Deep Roads or finding Andraste's Tomb in *DA:O*. *Legacy* is a bonafide dungeon crawl, and a pretty good one at that. The dungeon aims to shower you in loot, as you find tons of good items for all your classes, along with piles of gold to spend on some of the more pricey items back in Kirkwall. The DLC certainly feels like a reward of sorts... I played *Legacy* at the very beginning of Act III. It was a great interlude from the main plot to just go kick some ass and get gear. As mentioned before, the setting is a lot of fun, and they litter the place with codex entries that fill you in on what's around you as your party members add flavor dialogue. It should be mentioned that if you're a Grey Warden nut, you'll definitely enjoy some more of this Grey Warden history at the least.The fights are a lot of fun, ranging from land tactics to hordes of monsters to just a few big ones and everything in between. *Legacy* sets the pacing right, allowing you to hack and slash through monsters to get to a point where a tactical pause allows you to make the most of your next move. I played on Hard and only died once. I've got some air tight tactics programmed for my party though, and regardless of not dying, I was definitely sighing a breath of relief after a few fights. It was a decent amount of challenge for veterans, and I'm sure it will help newer players really start to understand the importance of tactics and where they stand.

There's not a lot of character development in this DLC, with my party of Anders, Varric, and Fenris, no one ever gained friendship or rivalry points based on my actions, even though their dialogue made it pretty clear how they felt about situations. I'm glad they don't mess with that actually, because there's plenty of that going on in Kirkwall. It's nice to take whoever you want to go bash some heads without worrying about the moral consequences. The plot has a few side quests that in my opinion sort of fizzle out, but are at the very least interesting for a time. The main plot is just fine, giving you a choice to make between two big things, which I think both end up the same way more or less.

So is *Legacy* worth the $10? Hard to say, really. Some may still be feeling stiffed from the $60 price tag of the original. On the other hand you could look at it as the cost of a movie ticket to get you into a four hour movie... not bad. I have to say I felt it was worth it, but that opinion will obviously change from person to person.

Will *Legacy* make *DA:O* die hards see the light when it comes to *DA2*? Probably not. The whole point of *Legacy* is to add some spice to the main game, which if you hated in the first place, this isn't going to change... However, if you played through *DA2* planning to never touch it again, but get a craving for a good old fashioned *DA:O* dungeon crawl, *Legacy* will definitely scratch that itch.

TL,DR: A fun dungeon crawl reminiscent of *Dragon Age: Origins*, but probably not going to make any new fans out of the *Dragon Age 2* naysayers. "	t5_2r8lo	True

Reading the Stolen Throne and talking to a lot of NPC's helped flesh out Loghain a lot as well.

Also, it seems odd that you'd execute your main political rival in front of everybody and his own daughter and not even spare him a trial; make the Warden look bad. Alistair's little rant if you consider making Loghain a Warden doesn't help endear Alistair to me either. 

In most of my playthroughs I end up killing him though, because I don't want to lose Alistair and Loghain's trust is at question.

This includes all DLCs relevant to the story of the warden and the champion, so all together it would be: origins, awakening, golems, witch hunt, 2, assassin, and legacy. But the coolest part of my whole Dragon Age experience was reflecting back and wittnessing the complex events I created without realizing it. My entire Dragon age story revolves around one crazy family starting the mage-templar war and plunging Thedas into chaos. Both of my charters were mages, both were part of the same family (Amell), and both are largely responsible for the series of events that started with the warden's harrowing and ended with the explosion of the kirkwall chantry. Starting from the beginning, my warden decided to side with Jowan in his origin because bros before hoes. This lead to my warden witnessing the tyranny of the templars (making Jowan tranquil, enforcing the right of annulment) and the desperation of the mages (Jowan resorting to blood magic, Uldred and his crew summoning demons). After visiting the ashes of Andraste and realizing that she too was simply a mage herself, my Warden began hating what the chantry and templars had become. For his boon, my Warden chose to liberate the Ferelden circle, which could be viewed as an ignition for the events to come. Eventually my warden passes these ideas of independence on to an already resentful Anders in awakening and introduces him to Justice. Seeing as how Wynne was able to form a benevolent pact with a spirit, the warden advises Justice to find a willing human host instead of a dead one. So Anders and Justice merge and create Vengeance. Now onwards to Dragon Age 2, my champion is an apostate on the run from templars and is caught in the middle of a crazy war in an insane, experimental Tervinter city (Band of Three). Witnessing the persecution of his brethren, my champion urges the mages to rebel and encourages Anders to act. Anders blows up the chantry and my champion sides with the templars, becoming a hero and rallying cry in the eyes of all magickers in Thedas. And so the wars begin... So I did infer a few things like the forming of Vengeance thing, but in the end it becomes one big set of unfortunate events of how a crazy mage family started possibly one of the greatest conflicts ever. I'm hoping I can play as a mage from the Amell family in DA3 and continue my epic, but we'll wait and see. Here's a screenshot of my characters if you're interested: http://i46.tinypic.com/ip137p.png (warden is an arcane warrior, hence the armor). tl;dr: Played dragon age for a week straight, lost my mind and fabricated a story of how the Amell family of mages was the ignition and catalyst of the Mage-Templar war."	t5_2r8lo	True

1357294003.0	15y0f1	Mages &amp; Golems: A look at pity in DA:O	Kitchen_accessories	47	15	23	"Abominations and golems are pretty damned scary things in the Dragon Age universe. On the one hand, you've got a 10-foot tall stone giant, and on the other you've got a crazed and demon-possessed mage. Yet, according to the poll at the top of /r/dragonage, the majority of respondents not only sided with Caridin in destroying the anvil, but saved the mages from the Right of Annulment. 

I am also guilty of this. Really, it's hard to say no to Caridin the sad golem. However, when you think about it, the Anvil of the Void really is worth saving. The dwarves have been caged in a corner since the advent of the Darkspawn, only gaining respite during the relatively short period of time when golems were accessible. Were the Anvil of the Void to be recovered, perhaps the Darkspawn could be hunted down and wiped out, thus preventing another Blight from ever even occurring.

However, the representative for this seemingly worthy cause is Branka, the woman who sacrificed a number of lives, including her lover, Hespith, to find it. Clearly, she is deluded, consumed and corrupted in pursuit of the Anvil.

Opposite her is Caridin, telling a story of how the Anvil was used and abused and turned against him. Truly, this is a sad story of a man (dwarf) who did not realize the magnitude of his actions until it was too late. Between crazy-ass Branka and betrayed-yet noble Caridin, it is easy to come to the conclusion that too many souls have been lost to the Anvil, and no more should be risked.

However, a simple cost-benefit analysis would likely put preserving the Anvil on top. Not only can the dwarves of Orzamar at last recover their ancestral homelands, but the world could be spared any further blights. There is the risk of a despot abusing the golems to eliminate political enemies, yes, but that risk is no greater than, say, sparing the potentially demon-possessed mages at the Circle of Magi.

When Irving tells the templars that the Circle is clear of demons, there is no reason to believe him when Cullen accuses him of being a maleficarum or abomination. Yet we do. By a large margin, respondents chose to spare the Circle. Why do we come to this decision?

Pity. Both the mages and Caridin are parties victimized by circumstance. The mages were attacked by demons, whilst Caridin was forced to become a golem. On the other side of the argument is paranoid and disturbed templar Cullen and amoral Paragon Branka; and while one might pity Cullen's fate, neither of their attitudes is very relatable.

As I said, I understand choosing Caridin and the mages. In nearly all of my playthroughs , I do exactly that. When you truly look at the options, though, they do somewhat oppose each other on an ideological level.

**tl;dr Preserving the anvil is clearly benficial but risky, as it could be abused, much the same as saving the mages, who could be abominations.  However, we don't because we pity Caridin and the mages and don't relate to Branka and Cullen. Thoughts?**"	t5_2r8lo	True

1374883359.0	1j4qwl	Companion predictions for Inquisiton: Getting the band back together (spoilers)	Pattonesque	39	6	69	"Bioware have their issues, but one thing they've generally been consistent on is creating memorable party companions. Though there's very little information on Inquisition's party members so far (aside from some concept art which, if Matt Rhodes' recent post is any indication, could just be more for the feel of the game than anything else), I think we can make some pretty reasonable predictions for what the party's going to look like, just based on past Bioware titles:

* You'll have at least six companions

* At least two will be warriors -- one sword-and-shield, one two-handed. You'll probably get the sword-and-shield one first.

* At least two will be rogues -- one dual-wielder, one archer. You'll probably get the archer first.

* At least two will be mages -- one healing-focused, one damage focused. Which one you get first will probably vary.

* At least one will be a dwarf, at least one will be an elf. 

* There will probably be one or two redundancies -- you had two two-handed warriors (and Shale) in Origins and two archers in DA2 (plus whichever sibling is still alive).

It's likely that at least a few characters who've already been established will show up as party members in Inquisition, although we can whittle down the list pretty quickly. An awful lot of your companions in the base games can be dead by the end of DA2 (everyone except Varric, Aveline, Isabela, and I think Sebastian for Hawke, and everyone except Sten, Morrigan, Oghren, and Leliana for the Warden), and even though Bioware has brought dead characters back before, I doubt they'd put a formerly-dead character in your party. That'd be a bit too on-the-nose in dispelling the illusion that your choices matter.

Anyway, you can probably dismiss a few of those left alive out of hand:

* **Sten** is busy being the new Arishok (if they stick the comic canon, which I think they will in this case). 

* **Morrigan** is probably going to be playing an NPC role, perhaps similar to Flemeth.

* **Leliana** is probably too busy being a Seeker, traipsing about Thedas as a lone wolf. Also she's a former romance option for the Warden, and I can't see them potentially doubling up on that. Too many variables.

* **Oghren** has already been a companion in two games, and there's really nowhere else for his story to go. You want characters who aren't fully explored -- do you really want to hear Oghren telling the same old stories again?

* **Sebastian** might work if he's a Chantry brother, but if he's a Prince of Starkhaven, that job seems a bit too important. He's out.

* **Isabela** is probably out 'cause she's a former romance option for Hawke, but other than that she doesn't have anything specifically preventing them from using her. She feels more like a cameo or sidequest appearance though.

* **Aveline** is secretly one of my favorites from DA2, but her story's pretty much told already.

We know from the trailer that two DA2 characters will show up in Inquisition: Cassandra and Varric.

* **Cassandra** feels like a maybe to me. You could use her for either warrior slot, and she's clearly important, but she might be in a non-party role -- she's pretty high-ranking, so maybe as an allied general.

* **Varric**, I think, is the most likely full party member from either game to make a return as a companion. He gives the Inquisitor a connection to Hawke, we still don't know *that* much about him so there's room for more character development, and he was probably the most well-received character from DA2. He's your rogue archer and possibly one of your first companions.

As for temporary party members or former NPCs, I have a reasonable feeling about two in particular becoming companions:

* **Tallis** had an entire DLC dedicated to her, is played by a well-known (but not prohibitively expensive) actress, could fit as a part of the inevitable Qunari storyline, and aside from a half-assed bit in MOTA is not romantically attached to a previous NPC. Plus, the post-MOTA codex entry on her is explicit about saying that Hawke is ""sure we haven't seen the last of Tallis"". 

* **Cullen** is inexplicably a fan favorite (he's OK, I guess?), gives the Inquisitor a connection to the Warden AND Hawke, can probably be easily removed from where we last saw him in Kirkwall, gives the player a Templar perspective, and could be introduced early, which fits perfectly as a sword-and-shield warrior.

Long-shots:

* **Finn** seems like a good fit considering he's an expert on Eluvians, which might end up being important to this story, but no one really remembers him.

* **Velanna** never actually died in Awakening, you know -- if you leave her at the keep, a section of the wall falls on her but no one ever finds her body. *Another* Dalish keeper mage seems like overkill at this point, though. EDIT: someone pointed out that you can gank her when you first meet her. Oh well!

The final roster could look like anything, but I feel pretty confident that at least one of Varric, Tallis, or Cullen will be a companion, with possibly more than one. YMMV. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious the rest of y'all will quickly point out."	t5_2r8lo	True

This evening I played through Return to Ostagar, and figured since I was down that way I would go ahead and go after Flemeth for Morrigan.  So I took Wynne, Alistair, and Leliana.  Alistair is specced for sword and shield tanking, Wynne is a healer, and Leliana is an archer.  
  
At first it was horrible.  I kept getting my butt handed to me despite my best efforts at micromanaging.  I finally decided to park all three squad mates a reasonable distance from each other so that Flemeth's fire breath would only get them one at a time.  And I gave Alistair a bow, figuring I would just slash away with Yusaris.  
  
Well, this worked completely beyond my expectations.  Flemeth kept breathing fire at Alistair, Wynne kept healing him and me, I kept slashing, and Leliana kept firing arrows.  The thing I didn't realize was, while I had ordered Alistair to Hold Position, I had forgotten to make him switch to his bow.  So he was just standing there, shield in hand, drawing all her aggro without actually doing any damage to her.  Meanwhile Flemeth wasn't completely ignoring me, but she wasn't doing me much damage either.  I whittled her health down to nothing and finally got the climb on top and stab animation.  
  
In the aftermath, I almost felt bad about winning that way."	t5_2r8lo	True

I recently finished Dragon Age II for the second time. For all its flaws, I really enjoyed the game, especially when it came to the characters. Rather than in Dragon Age: Origins (Which I do think is the superior game) where I spent my time comparing each companion to a companion in other Bioware games, i felt the companions were (for the most part) very well fleshed out in DA II. There were shades of grey. Take Merrill. Merrill is nice, sweet, working hard toward her goal of restoring her clan and never failing to look out for her friends as well. She doesn't presume much, and is generally very friendly. She's also a blood mage who's convinced dealing with demons is the way to go. So it's hard to easily slip Merrill into the usual good/bad category.

Or, for another example, Cullen. Who would have thought I would sympathize with Cullen. He's very dedicated to his job, and clearly harbors some anti-mage tendencies. But he also, critically, has doubts. The doubts make the characters. Flaws make characters.

Unfortunately, I think Bioware totally dropped the ball on Meredith and Orsino. The ending overall felt like it was trying to hard to ""darker."" Bioware is trying to go against the morally superior ending of DA: Origins and give us a ""no-win scenario."" Except the scenario is this: a mage has blown up the chantry, so Meredith demands all mages in the city must die. Now, even ignoring this is like demanding all Chechnyans in America must die after the Boston bombings, either Hawke is a mage, and it makes no sense to side with Meredith, or Hawke's sister is a mage, and Hawke might in some scenarios be forced to kill his/her sister. I really felt like it wasn't much of a choice.

The writers obviously felt this way too, which is why the truly awful Orsino boss fight was added in with him revealing he sponsored your mother's murder. Now, even if this information was given when the player could still choose to help Orsino or Meredith, I think it made the ending worse. Instead of grey vs grey, you have black vs black. A crazy genocidal maniac vs a crazy genocidal blood mage. I finished the game by going: I hate everyone, so why should I be invested in Meredith vs Orsino? Why should I care about their squabble? They are both awful.

See, I think in trying to create a darker ending, Bioware failed. They gave us so many morally grey characters, but couldn't succeed in their main antagonists. If Cullen was the Knight-Commander, and Anders was the first enchanter, then they would both be GREY characters. And I might have felt that siding with the Templars was sensible, rather than idiotic. 

Sorry for the long rant, but I'm disappointed. Bioware got so close, their character creation improved so much, but then they jumped down a ditch and ruined the ending."	t5_2r8lo	True

However, in Da 2 the ending is rather clouded. Most people think siding with the mages is the better 'moral option', but I also think siding with the templars can be a better outcome for Thedas.

The characters, lore, and plotline interested me in the way only BioWare games can, and the concept of chronicling the story of the champion over a span of years intrigued me.

The combat left much to be desired, and I wasn't a big fan of the inventory system either.

Now, I never played the original Dragon Age. I know, I know, I just missed it and never went back after playing the second one. Is this why I don't see DA 2 as a disappointment? Is it simply because I didn't experience the glory of the original? Or do I actually just enjoy a game that most do not?

1328283424.0	p9bwf	So, about DA3...	kalazar	31	2	35	"(Spoilers, Obv.)

In an attempt to stimulate some discussion in /r/dragonage, I bring up the following point;

It seems we're done with DA2 as of right now. There's no DLC in the future(unless they surprise us with something), there probably won't be an ""Awakening"" type expansion, and there's little in the way of information about DA3. With that in mind...

What is it you'd want out of DA3? BW has said they're looking specifically at taking elements out of DA:O and DA2, what do you think those elements are? What things would you love for them to bring over? What *wouldn't* you want? What new, as of now unannounced, things would you be interested in seeing(new class, not gonna happen, but just as an example)? 

Note: I'm *really* not interested in *another* ""DA:O was better than DA2! Don't bring *anything* from DA2!"" discussion. So please, please, please don't just go on about that.

Secondly, what do you think is going on? We've got some *really* interesting loose ends from DA:O and DA2. Do you think DA3 will cover them all?

Anyway, I'm hoping for more of the tactical elements of DA:O, but still keeping the fast-paced, exciting animation of DA2. And I'd like to have the epic story of DA:O(given how DA2 ended, I think this is pretty much unavoidable though) but keep some of the intimacy of DA2s party members. Oh, I'd also love to see the talent trees from DA2 kept.

As for things added in, I'd really like to see the ability to change my marching order. I mean, when I'm *not* playing a tank, I shouldn't be first into combat. But at the same time, I want to be controlling my dude. It's a small thing, but maybe it could work out."	t5_2r8lo	True

In Origins, since your character wasn't voiced, you didn't exactly need a preset name. Technically when you were introducing yourself, you used character's first-name, while not actually *saying* it.
 
But how exactly will this work in Inquisition, considering the player character will be fully voiced? Won't it be awkward? Imagine constantly introducing yourself as just your title, ""The Inquisitor"", or simply have like 0 NPC's actually *ask* for your name (which might make it even more awkward) It just... Seems kinda weird to me.
 
I looked up if Bioware has addressed this at all, and [the best thing I got was a tweet from Mike Laidlaw.](http://puu.sh/45aUT.png) He states that ""We've handled it in every game up to now"", but from what I understand, a ""preset name"" means that your character will be given a default name that people will address you as, such as Hawke or Shepard. So, I'm not quite sure what he meant in that tweet.
 
So I was just wondering your guys' thoughts on this. Do you think I'm overthinking this? Do you think Bioware will handle this well? Do you think they'll change their minds once they start writing the ingame dialogue, and just make a race-friendly last name? Or am I just stupid and not understand what they mean by ""preset name""?

I bought Dragon Age: Origins and loved it. I beat it twice along with several DLCs. I am also nearing the end of Awakening. I love the way the game works and to me, the story goes above all. 

I've pretty much spoilt myself the entire story of DA 2 apart from some details since I dont quite know the characters. I felt that it didnt make much sense with the several jumps in time, but that is probably because I never played it. 

So I ask, should I buy Dragon Age 2, along with DLC? Is it worth it? I heard a lot of hate regarding the fact that it is much worse than Origin or the recycled dungeons, but I want to know if it is overall an enjoyable experience.

Can the story compensate for these shortcomings?

1369440638.0	1f04vl	Idle musing on Grey Wardens, dragons, and possibly Flemeth, Witches of the Wilds and the Old God Baby	MisanthropeX	36	8	16	"I'm replaying DA:O and doing the bit where one goes into the Wilds for blood, and remember Duncan mentioning that the seals on the grey warden chest can only be opened by a grey warden, and of course, Morrigan was able to get them. Now, she *claims* the magic on the seals wore off, but to be perfectly honest, I don't think there are any examples of magic just ""wearing off"" in the franchise: ancient curses, veil tears, runes, etc, have a tendency to stick around.

Now, knowing what we know thanks to the trilogy of comics done by Gaider and also World of Thedas, we know dragons are kind of a big thing in the setting... fitting, since it *is* called ""dragon age"" after all. Most specifically, the blood of dragons is called the ""blood of the earth"" by Yavana, a witch of the wilds and one of Flemeth's daughters, and that King Calenhad drank the blood of a dragon during a ritual provided over by Flemeth to become a super-powerful reaver and use that power to unite Fereldan.

Now, while a lot of hullabaloo is made of the Grey Wardens having darkspawn blood/taint in them... we often gloss over the fact that it is *archdemon* blood that gives them their power, as a drop of blood from an archdemon is used in the joining ritual. And archdemons are... dragons. Tainted dragons, but dragons nonetheless, and it is this dragon blood which seemingly allows them to keep their wits and not become ghouls immediately (perhaps being related to the ability of Archdemons to maintain their intelligence when tainted and lead blights, and also the self-awareness of Disciples). Grey Wardens, then, are theoretically just as influenced by dragons as they are darkspawn.

Now, let's get to Flemeth. Information from World of Thedas specifies that when an archdemon is slain with no grey warden around, their soul/essence/consciousness/whatever goes into the nearest darkspawn and then shapeshifts that darkspawn into another high dragon. Combined with the fact that Flemeth tells Hawke that she may in fact BE a dragon and that her human form is just a shapeshifted ruse- this has lead a lot of people to theorize that she is one of the remaining old gods. The Witches of the Wilds, if they are Flemeth's biological daughters, could therefore also have the blood of dragons in them, much like how Calenhad's blood was passed down to Cailan, Maric and Alistair. If the seal on the Grey Warden scrolls were somehow set to react to the presence of *dragon blood* in the Wardens, it could be that Flemeth or Morrigan were able to open the seals.

What other similarities could a Witch of the Wilds have to a Grey Warden due to possibly having dragon blood in their system? How would a witch of the wilds react to being tainted, if they could be? There are also two beings in the setting who might have a ""double dose"" of dragon blood in them, or actually, one who definitely does and one who could have a *triple* dose. There's Alistair, of the dragon-empowered Theirin bloodline, and also the Old God Baby, who's the son of a potentially dragon-blooded Witch of the Wilds, a dragon-blood enhanced warden, and said warden could potentially be the already double-dragon-blooded (say that three times fast) Alistair.


Some stuff to think about, at least.


EDIT: I just remembered two more things: one, that Alistair's mother may or may not be the Grey Warden mage Fiona, who would logically already have archdemon blood in her system, and two, if the Warden so chose, he could take Kolgrim's offer to drink dragon blood and become a reaver himself, so that could also bring about more implications on the amount of dragon blood in the OGB's system, potentially."	t5_2r8lo	True
1367099885.0	1d8l75	Solo Nightmare Shapeshifter. No AW. No primal magic. No kiting.	Belthazzar	37	11	8	"Hey guys,

Ultimate Edition came out on Steam so I bought it since I had DA only on console and it was one of my favorite games at the time (havent played for a good year and a half though :P)

So I created new character and went on. During Loethering, when I hit lvl 7, I was wondering what to pick and then I got inspired to finally do a full nightmare solo run (I attempted it before on several characters, my best was walking bomb kite build, which I accidently deleted). 
I have put on myself couple limitations.

* No primal magic. My first nightmare finish was on mage who just spammed primal spells. Too easy. Too boring.

* No AW. All my mages had first or second spec AW. Even though there is no way to make my character look good in robes, I just have to try it with cloth. **EDIT:** I have picked AW as second spec because it puts Shapeshifter's autoattack on comparable levels with Warrior/Rogue. However, I only use Combat Magic active, **still wearing robes+staff**.

* No kiting. I kited enough. It's time to play like a man.

* Potions allowed. I know many people want to do potionless solo runs, but I dont have patience for that.

And since everybody says that Magic Shapeshifter sucks, I decided to prove the naysayers wrong (although I never played it before :P). 
And I have to admit one thing. Shapeshifter is *amazing*.

For the build:

First and foremost, I am mage, not manbearpigbee, so I use magic to kill things. When I face big groups, I have created new cheese.
**Death Magic + Death Cloud + Force Field**

Death Magic is great since it works in Force Field. Death Cloud is freaking badass spell. It feels epic everytime I cast down this blackness. Run into it's centre like I have no fear. And then Force Fielding myself looking at those fools lost in darkness dying. *Slowly*.

This kills every white-level mob and brings under 50% HP yellow ones. 

Then it's time for Shapeshifting.

Shapeshifing is incredible in one scenario: dueling. Switching between spider and bear can make fights quite easy even vs strongest opponets (you know the vial guy in Mage Tower? He was my nightmare since he always instakilled my characters. But he didnt instakill bearman). Every form is amazing even before lvl 12. And with Overwhelm. Oh my.

For attributes I just yank everything into Magic (+couple points into cunning. I like to persuade people)

For items:
I have everything I can with +healing effects (currently I have +35%), so Death Magic and Drain Life work great.
Rest it's mostly magic&gt;everything else.

Progress:
Mage Tower done (f*** templars).
Orzammar halfway done.
Redcliff 1/3 done (yeah I tend to travel)
bunch of dlcs done.

So far nothing was really problematic. My biggest challenge was the bounty hunter fight right when you want to enter Orzammar. Those guys hurt for how long they live. But the kill on them was really spectacular imo.
I casted Deathcloud on top of them right before they engaged me. Then I ran in near the mage. In the second he casted Fireball, I countered with Force Field on myself, knocking him and the rest of his friends down inside the cloud and dying swallowed by burning and darkness. All that was left alive was the yellow guy, who got eaten by spiderman. Whole fight took just few moments, but I reloaded there couple dozen times just to get perfect position on the mage to die within the cloud. If he didnt cast first fireball, the plan wouldnt work, because he would walk out of the cloud and I wouldnt survive.

Well, back to the game ^^"	t5_2r8lo	True

(CrossPosted from r/Mass Effect)	fiveforchaos	42	14	60	"So I don't think it's much of a secret that Bioware has some fallback archetypes as far as character models go. You've the got the gruff warrior from martially focused society (Wrex, Sten, Canderous), the synthetic being with some interesting opinions on its Organic creators (HK-47, Shale, Legion), the cute, naive yet talented girl leaving a close knit sheltered society to venture out on her own (Merill, Leliana, Tali).

There's also some very common themes, particularly between Dragon Age and Mass Effect. The conflict between freedom (particularly of those who could be dangerous) vs. safety for example is everywhere in those games, from the locked up Mages, to the Genophage inflicted Krogans.

It makes me kind of wonder how the characters from the two series would react to the issues, conflicts, and other characters in each other's games. I think it would be fascinating to just sit some of these characters down and let them have a discussion with one another. Shale and Legion talking about their relationships with organics, Tali and Merrill reminiscing about life in their outcast societies...

1341185528.0	vwd1s	Qunari with and without horns?	ForkBreaker	32	5	29	"This has been bugging me for a while, as most exprienced Dragon Age players may have noticed the Qunari in the Origins games look kind of like regular big and tall people, whereas in the 2nd game they are pale, horned, devil-like ""persons"". 

Is there a good explanation for this? I read somewhere that the Qunari born without horns are destined to succeed in the way of the Qun or something like that, which would explain why Sten in Origins has no horns. It also makes sense that the Arishok would send him on the mission to Ferelden since he is born with ""luck"". 

And that would have been enough for an explanation if Sten had been the only Qunari in Origins. However he isn't. There are numerous others throughout Origins and Awakening. For example Sten's companions that you meet in the Fade in his nightmare. Sure they could be born the same as him but it really seems odd since that ""born with no horns"" thing is from what I've heard very rare. Also there are alot of Mercenaries that are Qunari, or to be exact Tal-Vashoth in Origins. Sure, most Tal-Vashoth remove their horns but do really every single one of them care about that, I mean, they arn't following any of the rules of the Qun anyways, so why not keep the horns? Still these are not all of the Qunari that are encountered throughout the Origins games and is it really just a coincidence that none of them have horns?

However there is another theory, could it be that the Qunari in the Origins and 2 are different ""kinds"" of Qunari, just as there are different ethnicities of humans. Even if this is the fact it would seem weird that it just happens to be that there are only one of the two kinds of Qunari in each game.

Honestly I have very little actual facts about this and mostly theories, and that's why I ask you people about any ideas as to why the Qunari look so different in the two games. 

Also, my apologies if there are any typos or grammatical errors in this text as my native language is not English and my autocorrect is set to Swedish when typing this. (Yeah I wrote this on my phone, phew...)"	t5_2r8lo	True
1329347851.0	prf64	Should Dragon Age be more like Skyrim?	MyNameIsChar	34	8	33	"To say that I enjoy Dragon Age would be like saying that I enjoy breathing, or drinking water. I've played Dragon Age to an almost fanatical level; I regularly surf the official Bioware forums, I've participated in numerous Forum RPGs set in Thedas, I've even got into fights over which companions are best (Leliana and Merrill FTW). So imagine my horror when I read [this article about Dragon Age being 'more like' Skyrim.](http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a357257/next-dragon-age-could-be-more-like-skyrim-says-bioware.html)

Now, now, don't get riled. I enjoyed the Norway Simulator as much as any other Dragonborn, but it simply isn't in the same realm that the Dragon Age franchise resides in. Skyrim can never scratch the itch that came over me the first time I watched my blood splattered alter ego distribute an industrial grade portion of whup ass on a Darkspawn and it lies in the massive open world that gives the game the amazing accolades it deserves.

Bethesda and Bioware have separate and incredibly unique talents.

Bethesda-with its games like Skyrim and Fallout- know that people buy their games for the massive open worlds they make with such ease, because of this they focus most of their energy on it. It is just this that makes their games successful and they are fun to explore, but the characters they fill their worlds with are so transparent that they break the immersion, at least for me.

Bioware knows that the characters who fill the world are just as important-if not more so- than the world itself. The Jarls, Bandits and innumerable other baddies that assailed me whilst exploring the beautiful land of Skyrim could have just as easily been made of cardboard, they were there for me to kill and loot; nothing more. There was no internal anguish when I cut down a companion, nor when I pillaged villages. There was too much world and not enough substance to it.

This is what I fear Dragon Age becoming.

While Skyrim is broad, Dragon Age is focused. The people in Skyrim give you quests, the inhabitants of Thedas send you on adventures.

I remember well the pain in my companion's eyes as they looked on during my funeral. I wept openly when I made a mistake that made Leliana turn on me as we searched for Andraste's Ashes. I found myself cursing a Knight Commander Meredith as we battled to the death. I laughed at Alistair's dry sarcasm. I felt betrayal when my companions turned on me. When Merrill told me of her incredibly loneliness I cried with her, and grinned when she smiled at me.

I WAS the Warden, I AM Hawke. I can never be Dragonborn. "	t5_2r8lo	True
1305718573.0	he4s9	Why doesn't anyone mind when you become a blood mage? (DAO spoilers)	fourthirds	30	4	27	"I picked up DAO on a recent steam sale and I'm really enjoying it - definitely a worthy successor to BG2. However, one thing that really bugs me about the game is the disconnect between the storyline attitude towards blood magic and the actual use of blood magic by the player. In the story, the templars and the circle of mages are all about hunting down apostates and dishing out instant death to anyone who even thinks about blood magic. In conversations with your party members they're always talking about how dangerous blood magic is and how it's evil and blah blah blah.

But then, you can learn blood magic yourself and start using it constantly, and no one even comments. I've got a party of 3 mages who all use blood magic (even the peace-and-love Wynne) and Alistair the templar and no one says anything. When you duel Loghain in front of everyone in the realm at the Landsmeet, you can spray blood your everywhere as you mind control him into eating his own face, and nobody says boo about it.

I decided to play the PC as someone who would use blood magic in order to defend innocents and protect the realm, expecting to have a lot of difficult conversations where I'd have to justify my use of blood magic and defend against zealous templar. Instead, no one seems to give a shit even when I possess a popular warlord in the middle of city hall.

I still really enjoy the game, but the lack of consequences for the PC doing blood magic seems like a big omission. It'd be like if Luke Skywalker started using force lightning on Chewbacca during the medal ceremony and nobody said anything."	t5_2r8lo	True

Mad_Hatter96	30	4	16	"Just a thought I had about all the Dragon Age: Origins ""Origin Characters""  that you play as to become the Grey Warden. we often see the events between the origins connect to the main storyline, some more than others. I just thought it would be interesting if you came to Ostagar with all the origins together, and you were a party that grew closer with each other.

Sort of an AU where a dwarven commoner, a dwarven prince, a human noble, a dalish elf, a city elf, and a mage from the circle all meet up and survive the battle of Ostagar together. The differences in history and views would make a very interesting band of saviors.

I'm not sure if there would still be the regular band with Morrigan, Alistair, Leliana, etc. to join them but the Origin group would be really cool, at least in my mind.

Any thoughts on this? obviously its not a real thing but it can't hurt to have an awesome imaginary scenario of them working together

Edit: Thank you Frost Falcon for correcting the typo

Edit2: Just to clarify that the only way for most of the origin characters to be saved is because of duncan, but since the events of each origin usually have a bit of time apart from each other it was my thought that perhaps he made a trip through the countryside gathering each recruit in their hour of need and brought them all together. The Noble Origin shows that there was more than just Duncan traveling around the region, so its entirely possible he could have been making house calls to all of his old friends and recruiting Grey Wardens from each location."	t5_2r8lo	True

1346974440.0	zh62f	What I would like to see in Dragon Age 3 and beyond and what I liked in DA2 (Fighting Style) 	notsosubtle_	33	7	33	"I would think that in the next two years Dragon Age 3 would wrap up. So this may be more of a plea for Dragon Age 4.

I loved the fighting style in Dragon Age 2. The expansions started to add in more tactics to it but the quality of the fighting styles got better with DA2. Dragon Age Origins may have had more realism for great sword fighters but let's not beat the realism drum. We are fighting creatures that have been shat out from various fantasy races because we drank blood and a large corrupted dragon is pissed at us. 

I will use the Rogue as an example. I didn't mind the tactic of having to get behind and stay behind someone. It added a bit of realism and tactics that I personally hadn't found in a recent rpg. If you went with a bow, you started out barely doing damage. After a while you could make an orge stumble and charge you because you hit for an 1/8 of his health in one shot. 

My only problem with fighting with daggers in DA:O was that you basically became a fighter with daggers about 3/4 of the way through. This carried over to the expansions for DA:O as well. Dragon Age 2 offered fast paced fighting that made you keep up with everything and everyone around you. It much harder to do in DA:2 in my own opinion but by far more fun. I felt like a ninja in Dragon Age 2. (fantasy hollywood style ninja mind you) From dropping a smoke bomb and popping up behind someone to stab them to going into stealth and attacking from the shadows. It was fast and fun. 

For two handed fighters you took a beating early in DA:O because heaven help you if you missed a swing and you were fighting someone with two weapons. They would get in about four hits before you could come back around for the next swing. It was ponderous and slow but I did build a character and had a ton of fun with it. DA:2 brought fast fighting with this style to. I felt like Conan swinging my sword. Cutting through enemies and leaping through the air to attack the next group. Hitting them all at once and swinging so hard I could hit someone a few steps back. (they had that in both DA:O and DA2). 

To me it was an overall improvement on the whole fighting part of the game. My one and only complaint was that they took out two weapon fighters. I looked forward to using the two weapon style but with the updated style of DA2. I was pissed when I didn't find it. I tried the two handed great sword warrior and I was pleased. I still miss the two weapon fighting style. No Drizzt for DA2. Hopefully 3 will have this. 

How they can expand on the fighting roles is a mystery to me. I want two weapons to make a come back for DA3. I would love to see the movements and attacks for this style. High damage and lower defense is fine with me. Especially when it would be a room clearer. Killing faster than a two handed fighter would be fun to see.

I want to see more styles added to the current ones. They did this for Mark of the Assassin. I have not played this yet. I did read where Talia had her own fighting style and it was something they would have added in future expansions. Hopefully 3 will bring more styles. I loved the jump in fighting styles. I would hate to see skyrim style fighting. I know they said they wanted to do more of a skyrim style game (without the thousands of glitches and dead pan characters).

1333211516.0	rmidg	I just finished Mass Effect 1-3 and loved them.  Will I enjoy DA2?	the_federalist	31	4	53	"A little background:

I played DA:O before the Mass Effect series.  I can't express how much I loved DAO.  When I played the DA2 demo I was seriously disappointed because of how different the game was.

A lot of people complained that BioWare had ""mass effected"" DA2.  I decided to play the Mass Effect series to see what they were saying about the dialogue wheel, etc.

Thing is, I loved Mass Effect.  It's not the same as DAO but still a great series.

So.  Assuming that I take DA2 as a stand-alone game, does it stack up, story-telling, relationship, and companion-wise, with Mass Effect 2 and 3?

1301687527.0	ggn7g	Thoughts after playing through a couple times. Spoilers, natch! 	stuffandwhatnot	28	2	47	"Oh my, this got long. 

First off, I liked it. Rather a lot I suppose, since I've played it through a couple of times. I loved--LOVED--Origins and I am enamored with the whole Thedas society, mythology, and world. I won't spend time on the cons (repetitiveness, same maps every freakin' time, bugs up the wahoo, etc.), which have all been discussed in detail elsewhere.

**Romance**

I appreciated having all the romanceable (except for Sebastian) characters available no matter whether I played a male or female Hawke. Of course, if you want to romance a male character, your choices are limited to Broody Elferson or Rage McMage, and your female choices are Weirdo Jitteryelf or Sleazy Nopants... but I appreciated the effort.

I was bummed that the two most appealing companion characters (Varric and Aveline) were not available romantically. In my mind, Hawke's carrying on a raging affair with Varric the whole time and he's just telling Cassandra all that other stuff to cover. Heh.

**Companions**

They all grew on me. I was a big Alistair fangirl and at first I missed having a sweet goofball in the bunch, but I ended up getting attached to them. 

* Fenris. I like playing mages, so his hateon for mages got to me at first. Then I decided it was my personal goal to get him to 100 friendly so I could force him go fight for mage rights, and in the process of getting him there, he grew on me. Partially because I love his voice.

* Anders. Oh, Anders. His story really did break my heart. He was such a fun goofball in Awakening. When he asked for sela petrae and drakestone, I KNEW it. I thought, 'shit, he's got the gaatlok formula and he's gonna blow up the Gallows!' Then when he asked for help distracting the grand cleric, I actually said out loud, 'you dumb fuck!'. 

* Merrill. Creeped me out. But her story really is kind of tragic. Definitely was more sympathetic on the second play. Also, she's voiced by Gwen from Torchwood, so there's that. 

* Isabela. My least favorite companion. I should try using her more to see if she's got any redeeming qualities. Right now, the only reason I see for getting her friendly is so she comes back with the book. She does make for some funny companion dialogue though.

* Aveline. I looooove Aveline! I think the love began when she said, ""Bit of a tit, your brother."" I was BUMMED that they let you flirt with her but she only has eyes for Donnic. 

* Varric. If he was romanceable, Hawke would been all up on that hairy chest before you could say 'Bianca'. 'nuff said.

**Setting/theories**

Templars... I was under the impression from Origins (and correct me if I'm wrong) that Templars, being a religious order of holy warriors, were either not allowed to marry or at least it was heavily discouraged. My reasons for thinking this being Alistair's chaste upbringing into templar-dom, and the scene in the Circle tower where the templar is being tempted by the desire demon. She doesn't tempt him with money or sex or power, but with a wife and children. A home. Then also there's Cullen's distress over the appearance of the Warden (if you played a female mage warden). 

Like I said before, I really like the world/societies/mythologies of Thedas. I'm intrigued by the whole series of 'Enigma of Kirkwall' codex entries. They say that the veil is thin around Kirkwall, that the magisters deliberately thinned it further by massive secret blood sacrifices (thousands of slaves just disappearing, grooves built into the sewers for blood to flow), that the city is laid out in a series of glyphs and signs, and ends by implying some Forgotten One god or demon is behind it all.  

Then Hawke ends up delving deeper into the Deep Roads than anyone and discovering a primeval thaig, unknown to dwarven lore. A... Forgotten thaig, perhaps? With a creepy powerful lyrium idol representing some... Forgotten Thing?

Then Leliana says the Elthina has to leave because they have intel that outside forces are at work and her life is in danger. 

So then is Anders just a mere pawn in some greater game? (Which would only make his story more tragic.) After all, the destruction of the Chantry and everyone in it could definitely qualify as a massive blood sacrifice, of the kind unseen since the days of the magisters...

Speaking of Anders, the timeline for Anders doesn't quite work out. Origins takes place over a year, which in DA2 is the year Hawke works as a mercenary or smuggler. Then Awakening takes place six months after Origins. So... when did the Wardens make Anders give up his cat (a cat that the Warden-Commander/Hero of Ferelden/king of Ferelden's mistress [who was a freakin' mage in my import, ffs] GAVE to him)? When did he merge with Justice? How did he go from goofy goofball to Ragey Magepants in... no time at all?     

**Superficial shallowness**


The hair... Oh Maker, the hair. The hair choices for Lady Hawke are abysmal. Why why why can't we use the hair on the default Marian Hawke but change the features? Those lyrium-addict-blue eyes are creepifying. The only hair I halfway like is the short Cassandra Pentaghast style.

The clothing choices for mages are fuuuuug-ly up till you get the Champion robes.

Knight-Captain Cullen. Love. Him. I'd dig a game with him as a companion/romanceable option. Just sayin'. 

Okay, **tl:dr:** It's flawed and I'm hoping for bug fixes soon, but I liked it and will play the next one. "	t5_2r8lo	True

I have completed almost all the endings, I am currently finishing up female human noble (become queen with Alistar). ( I am aware of some spelling mistakes on names; I am to lazy to figure out how to spell them correctly.)

The choices I made on my favourite play through were: 
I was a Dwarf Noble Warrior out wanted to join the wardens and then was exiled from my kingdom. A pond leaving Lothering I went to get my Elvish allies. I helped the Eleves, but made Zathrien kill himself to end the curse. The only real reason I did this is because I wanted to have a charismatic good leader and this seemed like the moral choice to make. I then went to the  mages tower and saved the circle. Again seemed like the correct moral choice. I also felt like having the support of the mages would be more beneficial to me than having the templars. I then went to Redcliff and killed Connor's demon in the fade. After I had the two thirds of my army ready for war, I proceeded back to Orzamar where I put Bhelen on the throne, even though he had betrayed me. The reason I did this was because Harrowmont would make a poor king. He is too caught up in tradition, where Bhelen would be the more beneficial choice to have for the Dwarven race to survive. I also destroyed the Anvil for the sole reason of it would cause more harm than good to my people. I then went to Denerim and put Alistar on the throne alongside with Anora and made Loghain take the joining. In the final battle I made Loghain take the killing blow against the arch demon to redeem his sins. The only boon I asked for was support against the darkspawn; With Bhelen taking his reforms he already would have pushed the darkspawn back with the support of the Humans, the Dwarfs could finally take back a large chunk of the deep roads. 

So that is my favourite play through, please give tell me what you did and why you made each big decision. "	t5_2r8lo	True

I (a mage, in case it matters somehow) sided with Harrowmont and when it came time to settle the vote in the assembly, Bhelen attacked and all the deshyrs began to fight. But for some reason most of them were using staves. It struck me as odd when I saw them standing around with them, but assumed they were purely ceremonial until the fighting broke out. Once combat began they started using them, actually attacking with them and firing projectiles and everything. I haven't seen this addressed anywhere, and I'm just wondering if there's any explanation for this apparent contradiction.

She's sweet, caring, funny and naive one minute and the next she's verbally sparring with Fenris and Anders.

She's such a tragic character at times that it hurts just to be there when everything is going wrong for her and it makes me want to help her. Making a pact with any demon/spirit is a big deal, but Merrill didn't just go for your run-of-the-mill Desire Demon, she went for the second baddest there is, a Pride Demon. 

Plus, I have a thing for elves. 

I like rivalmances a little more than romances, on the whole, but as far as Merrill's rivalmance goes it's not as good as, say Fenris's rivalmance. So I usually go with her romance instead. At the end of the day it just kinda feels like she's given into Hawke and he/she is just rolling over her. I would turn her rivalmance up 2000% if I could. "	t5_2r8lo	True

Also when you die in the world of Dragon Age apparently you go to the makers side or at least into the fade and in the Inquisition trailer we see the fade ripping open and demons and such come rushing out.

Actually, the mages weren't evil. It was a misunderstanding.

In the high time of the Tevinter Imperium, the elves were immortal. And as bored, immortal beings, they attempted to become like the Maker in wisdom and power and strength. The Tevinter mages, seeing the pridefulness of the elves, risked everything to reach the Golden City in an effort to warn the Maker that the immortal elves were attempting to recreate themselves in His image.

Unfortunately, the Maker did not give heed to the Tevinter mages, instead casting them down for the hubris that they showed in entering his sacred realm. It was only after casting the Tevinter mages down that the Maker realized his error, but it was too late: the darkspawn had already been let loose upon the world.

The Maker did heed the mages' warning and brought the elves in contact with humanity, the event that would bring about the slow decline of elven civilization. And then the Maker fled, ashamed at his pride and the destruction it would cause in the world.

I would like to start off by saying that this is the most frustrating place my mage has ever gone to, partly as my fault because i totally skilled him badly (made him the primary healer and everytime i have to take morrigan, my dps mage, out for someone else for a special event or something such as the deep roads my damage and aoe capabities are nonexistant)


But i am currently on the part where the dwarf woman (i forgot her name) voices over everything and i just want to say: what the fuck?! i did not expect the dwarven arc to be the most brutal and gruesome of them all. i thought the mage tower seemed pretty rough with the massacre of everyone there, or even the elves treatment of the werewolves, but holy crap this is just a crazy place! i no longer regret not having played a dwarf character yet. this seems too much even compared to the infighting in Orzammar

TL;DR Dwarves are scary as hell

Edit: WTF THIS BROODMOTHER OMG EW

Edit2: BRANKA IS CRAZIER THAN OGHREN

Edit3: I can't even do this boss battle this is ridiculious too many anti-magic guys lol

Edit:4 I'm going to try and do the boss battle again later today. also i read up on some things about the decision  between saving and destroying the anvil and man the dwarven storyline is so complicated. Elves were a simple dispute to solve, mages just needed some saving, arl needed some silly urn, but dwarves need to have a game for just them or something because their quest line is realllly long.

Edit5: I finished the dwarven coronation awhile ago and wow i don't even know if i chose the right one (I picked Bhelen because he supported the casteless)."	t5_2r8lo	True
1373224168.0	1htdbz	Dragon Age Origins: How to make a rogue effective?	Besthealer	25	4	13	"**EDIT:** Thank you for all your suggestions. The key thing I learnt from the guides was use of the Momentum ability for dual-wield rogues: it was something I overlooked before as the upkeep was huge and it drained constant stamina. However I have started using it and it annihilates like no other! The stamina drainage is completely negligible (either that or broken) and the damage increase is amazing.
_________
I have played DA:O many times but only ever completed it once. I am trying to play it again on the hard difficulty so as to make use of strategic decisions, healing potions and the like. However, every time I make a rogue, either as an Archer or as a Melee I find them completely useless. I find archers do much less damage than a mage and have a fraction of the utility, and the melee variety don't hit as hard as a 2h warrior and also die much faster.

I have run through the game with 2 Warriors 2 Mages and 1 Warrior 3 Mages before due to not being able to use rogues correctly. I would love to employ either a ranged or melee rogue so to make use of the extra skill points, stealthing, and things like that.

Also I want the rogue to be effective early on in the game, not told that ""at level 15+ rogues are good"".

""If we really have to go somewhere urban, let’s not go to Kirkwall, Let’s go somewhere new. Maybe somewhere a little more... French.""

I was playing through D2 today when I found this gem. In Act 3 Bodhan tells you that he and Sandal is leaving for Orlais (Sandal is going to go serve the emperor.)

1256314694.0	9x2v0	Which platform should I get this game for?	arkx	26	5	24	"I've been a PC gamer for a long time and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of BioWare's games since the first Baldur's Gate. All the Infinity Engine games are especially close to my heart.

Times have changed since then. Most of the new exciting games are released on consoles and I've long since switched my main gaming platform to Xbox360 and PS3.

Here is my dilemma. I truly don't know which of these three platforms I should get this game for. Judging from what I've seen so far PC seems like the best option - keyboard and mouse just fit these games really well. Then again, Jade Empire and Mass Effect work beautifully on Xbox360. Most of the new games these days are developed for the consoles and their respective PC ports are just that -- ports. I haven't played Mass Effect on PC so I wouldn't know whether BioWare has jumped on this bandwagon yet -- do they still respect PC as a gaming platform, knowing that it makes them very little money compared to the consoles?

I'd be very interested in hearing what reddit has to say regarding this. The official answer will of course be ""they're all equal"", but this is rarely the truth. Does any of you know of any major differences between the different versions? Which platform are you going to get it for?"	t5_2r8lo	True
1375546087.0	1jmq4n	So I'm finally playing Dragon Age 2 [Spoilers]...	Kitten_Pryde	39	18	39	"Originally I was holding out, since everyone was saying how bad of a game it was. I played, or at least tried to play, Dragon Age: Origins, but it was impossible to me. It's like playing Mass Effect 1 again. I hated the game play, but fell in love with the story and especially the characters. So, I finally decided to play Dragon Age 2 for the first time. At first, I was going to import my half-assed character, but decided against it. Playing even part of DA:O was extremely helpful since I know a lot of things, such as Aveline's name, and I met a few characters, like Flemeth, Alistar, and Zevron, and currently it's extremely fun. I'm not really seeing where all the hate comes, perhaps it's the ending. I know I'm nearing the end since Merrill keeps breaking the 4th wall and pretty much rubbing the fact into my face.

Some things I enjoyed so far:

* The characters. Some I hate, some I love. It's all wonderful, though, I do miss Morrigan... and my dog Hades.

* Hawke has a voice! I hated not having a voice as the Warden in DA:O, just like in Skyrim. I never really end up caring about my character or anything when I can't hear what they're saying.

* The dialogue wheel was pretty helpful, but I still saved before every conversation just in case I fuck up somewhere.

* The game play is fun. I kinda wrecked my A button on one controller when I got too heated in a battle. What? My sister was in danger. Anyway, the same thing happened to my X button from Mass Effect.

* The length of the game is great. I know I'm nearing the end, but I still love it. I wish it was longer actually. I never buy DLC, but I think I might make an exception.

* Family. I thought that was a great addition. I know I had a family in DA:O, but they all died in 10 mins. Well, like 45 mins for me, I had no idea where to go because the map was so bad. Anyway, I actually grew attached to my sister and mother, but my brother can go eat some shit. I never liked him.

* The map as, previously stated, was just something that bothered me in DA:O. I hated it. I really like the improved map.

* Toggle-able helmets. I have never once seen a cool helmet, not even the Champion's {At least on female rogues.}

* The default faces. I normally love making my characters, but I could never get it right. I've always pictured all of my bad-ass characters with short black hair, like Hawke's, and blue eyes, like Hawke's, and some kind of marking or tattoo on their face, like Hawke's. I love it. I wish more games gave that hair style for girls.

Some things I wish that were changed/different/bothered me:

* For some reason, my party stopped interacting with each other now that I'm at the end. I'm pretty bummed, since I *loved* when they banter. Reminds me of Morrigan and Alistar. Maybe it's because I always carry around the same people. I don't know.

* Like Leliana in DA:O, Isabela and Fenris are never really mentioned as recruit-able, which bothered me a bit. I did get both of them, and Leliana in DA:O by pure luck, and Isabela ended up being a favorite of mine. I'd be pissed if I missed her. I just want some warning, that's all.

* Copy/Paste caves/environments in general. Sure, this ended up helping in the long run, since the same team means the same tactics every battle, but I really hated how it was all just... the same.

* Gifts. Sure, I only abused them to stop having my friends hate me *Cough* Morrigan *Cough,* but I still miss them. Not like these petty 2 gifts per character, I miss having mounds and mounds of gifts I'd throw at them. Fun.

* One of these battles made me want to chuck my Xbox out the window. I have no idea why that one ass-wipe {Can't remember his name} was so tough, but there were enemies just... Flooding. The High Dragon was easier then that bullshit.

* 0 sexual preferences. Sure that worked to my favor, but still. When I like characters, I still want them to be human. This goes for that. I know it's a bit nit-picky.

* Armor ratings are so obscure. Isabela wears cloth. Literal cloth. There is one actual armor piece, and she still had a higher armor rating then me for the longest time. We're both the same class doing the same shit, too.

* As far as I know, once you get Champion's Armor, you're good to go. I just killed the High Dragon, and got the chest plate {Final piece I needed, I was holding out on killing the high dragon} and went from 200-300 something AR to 618 AR.

* Losing Bethany. I thought I had it *all* figured out. I thought that I had the best team ever. Then they took Bethany from me and threw her in the Circle. She literally was all I ever wanted in a mage, and there isn't a single good replacement mage. Now, I have Merrill as a replacement, but she's a piss-poor replacement at that. I've seen Beth twice since she got taken, and not a single one had been either and epic reunion or her finally joining me again.

I'll spruce up the list a bit later, but so far this is what I like and dislike.

Edit: Just finished the game, adding to the lists. I'll just add things as I think of them now. I'm also thinking of getting some DLC, which is rare for me.

Liked:

* The final battles were nice. Like, it was nice to see everyone come and help.

* I had Beth back. It may have been for one battle, but I never lost a single one. I've never been so excited to recruit a character before.

* I forgot to mention this before, but Aveline had some of the *funniest* missions. Like when she's trying to get a date with that guard. It's even more hilarious if you bring along Isabela, who is always on my squad. They have some of the best dialogue together.

Disliked:

* I have no idea what happened to Hawke. Varric just said that all split up, except Isabela stayed with me, and that was that. Horribly confused, kinda disappointed me. Then there was 10 seconds of Leliana it looked and sounded like. I have no idea if there are multiple endings or not, but if there are, I either got the horribly bad ending, or the best ending. Everyone lived, so I guess it's the best?

* 0 time to prep for the final battle. There were no red flags being flared. I was running low on health potions and I thought I was just going to settle an argument, then things spontaneously combusted as I walked to their argument. 0 warning, 0 prep, I was just thrown into battle.

* They never really elaborated on Sandal... which was a bit disappointing since he... you know... killed all those blood-magic things."	t5_2r8lo	True

I've seen people on here complain about the animation style, and maybe that particular style isn't for you; that's okay.  I think they tried to mix Dragon Age's art with anime, and while I think it turned out well, other people may not agree.  While the first few minutes of seeing that style was a bit startling, I got used to it as the movie went on and just enjoyed the story.

The voice acting was really good as well.  I admit that I may be biased on this particular point, seeing as I like anime and Funimation.  I'm used to hearing Funimation's voice actors, and a few of my favorites were in the movie.  

There were a few points where I frowned and audibly said, ""Cassandra, you a dumb-ass bitch,"" but characters *are* supposed to have flaws and whatnot.  I enjoyed the other characters and wished I could have seen more of them.  

I think my biggest complaint was that there were ***not enough elves***.  But I'm a weirdo and I really, really like elves, so that might not be a problem for most people.

I'll start (PC):

* loading screens everywhere, even during a dialogue! Is my computer just plain slow or did you notice it, too?

* combat is more chaotic, with more emphasis on say 'immersion' but less on tactics. Without a good overview of the battlefield, it'll be hard to put some tactics from DA:O into good use (like scouting ahead with an invisible rogue and then SotC on the enemy group). I guess it won't be an issue on lower difficulties but I'm worried that either ""hard"" will be easier now or it will be much harder because of the action-orientation. That's ""hard"" to tell from the demo, though.

* The wheel dialogue is okay for inquries, but I miss having the option of knowing what Hawke is about to say in the other, more ""violent"" options. In Origins, you could read the witty response, but say the good thing (because deep down you're the good one). Here, not so much. 

* I find the new skill system okay. Interesting twist by needing friendship with Hawke for some skills.

I have a general idea why but nothing really concrete in my reasoning. I think it's the politics of the whole thing. 

Don't get me wrong. I love getting into political areas of the games and I love the Thaig parts. That area of it is one of my favorites. I have to trudge my way through Orzammar doing their political backstabbing for the Dwarves just to get to go to the Thaig. 

The first time I played Origins and stumbled my way through Orzammar was the worst time I had in the whole series. 

Dwarves are one of my favorite Tolkien creatures. It feels wrong to be so unexcited about them when in Orzammar. Elsewhere, they are great. I love Oghren. Varric is one of my favorite characters in anything ever. I wish I could get excited about Orzammar.

For games like Mass Effect, another Bioware title, this system works well because you play as the same character throughout all three games.

But Dragon Age is different. You play as three different characters in the main games. But you are still you. You have the same morals and ideas about the goings on in Thedas. I personally abhor blood magic and don't use it. I was also merciful in both games. Basically they are how I would act. But they're different people, so why should they have the same morals? 

Also, you know the choices you made in DA:O and DA:2. Hawke wouldn't know every choice the Warden made and the Inquisitor wouldn't know what Hawke did. 

Now to my thoughts on the issue. Would it be possible to import other peoples save games via the Dragon Age servers? This would open up different quests and surprises waiting for you in DA:I. You could upload your save games and use someone elses saves for your game. This would be a feature you could opt out of if you weren't comfortable with it of course.

Anyways, it seemed to me that in the Mass Effect games, that the romance part of it was very childish and came off badly. You pick the right dialogue and you get rewarded with a blue chick banging Shepherd. It was rather corny and wasn't done well at all, in my opinion. 

I think Bioware learned a little from Mass Effect, but as far as Romance went, it felt like the childish Mass Effect had grown into a little more mature teenage version of the same. 

Non party characters never said anything about it. Wouldn't your Warden being in an intimate relationship with an Apostate Mage, a wanted criminal in Orlais, an Antivan Crow or the man who you support to be king be a great deal of political ammunition to use against you? 

It just feels to me like the child laughing at seeing pee pee parts in Mass Effect grew into a pimply teenager in Dragon Age.

- The cut and paste levels. It took away from the magic.
- The crazy amount of humans you killed in this game...it felt like I was killing thieves, bandits, and who-knows what every second. 
- The *Profanes were pretty neat, I wish they incorporated them more. (Hopefully DA3?)
- The Music really was pretty bad. There was not ONE memorable piece, and a lot of it seemed lazily slapped together. DA1 had some awesome music, like I am the One, and Leillana's song.
- Felt pretty cramped, only staying within Kirkwall, left the whole ADVENTURE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD bit out.

PROS!

- Graphics were greatly improved, looked more fluid.
- The combat is more involved and fast-paced!
- Hawke can now talk! And he's funny, badass, or serious.
- The companions seemed to have more depth to them, and I liked how you could visit them at their respective houses.

- The talent trees were pretty cool, as well as the Loyalty bars. 
- How some decisions in DA:O were seen in this game.
- The Qunari and Elf redesign.


OVERALL

I really liked it, and spent over 35 hours beating it, and I will most likely try it again. I felt the mage/templar feud was very well thought out, and I had some serious difficulty choosing a side. I had to put my controller down and actually think about it. BioWare definitely is on to something with this series, once the third one come out, I bet they will address all the problems fans have pointed out. Otherwise, I enjoyed it a lot, and I would say it's on the same level as Origins, but for different reasons. "	t5_2r8lo	True

Hi everyone,

So a couple of days ago i was seeking a RPG game because i never really played one before and wanted to go for a try. I was at the shop, searching first for Fallout 3 but wasn't there, so i brought DA2 (had a cheap price). A lot of people told me before that is wasn't so good and maybe the worst Bioware Game.

**Anyway i tried, and i must say that after 5 hours of game non stop i really like this game ! Maybe it is because i've never played a real RPG before, but anyway i love the gameplay action very agressive, the tactical approach, story etc.**

*So I was wondering why do people really don't like it? I'm I the only one who thinks its a great game ? I've never played DA1 before, so maybe that's why.

Oh and, I don't understand completely the past of Hawke, must i play DA1 to learn more on background ?*"	t5_2r8lo	True

I am currently making a character for the Dragon Age RPG. I want to ensure my background is all lore appropriate, so I need to ask a few questions to those of you more familiar with the lore:

Is it conceivable that a male noble would deny their own male child born to a duster?

Is it conceivable that a duster woman would hide the fact their son is noble born or would pretty much any duster woman jump at the chance to enter the noble class?

Basically I want a character born from the rape of a casteless woman by a warrior caste but he does not want the son immediately. He later changes his mind after the child is older but the mother has hidden the child and the father kills the child's mother and adoptive father.

His goal in life is to find and kill his birth father (since the DA RPG puts a lot of focus on goals for your character)."	t5_2r8lo	True
1365279701.0	1btaoz	Your opinions on the ethics and consequences of 'hardening'. DA:O	Katow-joismycousin	22	5	20	"This is a difficult moral choice for me during the course of this game. See here for a brief explanation: http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Hardened.

Playing the game a  bit of a 'good guy' my first instinct on this one was to leave my friends unhardened. It seemed it was just a way of making them assholes and willing to go along with deviant behaviour.

Now I am undecided based on what I have seen and read. Is hardening bad? One of the things I like about this game is that there is no generic good/evil morality system as in so many Bioware (among others) RPG's. There are actions and consequences. Sometimes there are even no consequences if you don't get caught!

So let's discuss this shall we? Alistair is a sweet and kind of dopey guy with a strong sense of right and wrong that borders on the naive. Yet even he admits when you meet him that the Wardens must do extreme things to stop the Blight. His actions lack conviction though. As I was playing mostly 'good guy' I usually managed to keep him sweet but when I tried to recruit Loghain he let his personal vendetta get in the way. If the PC was actually being morally flexible for the sake of pragmatism that would be one thing, but letting a broken, defeated man live isn't hurting anyone or anything except Alistair's bitter feelings.

I was disappointed. Even in the page linked above it mentions a consequence of 'hardening' to be him being more inclined to put personal feeling ahead of duty, but that's what's already happening! So for those among you who have played this scenario out please give me your opinions. How much of a dick is 'hardened' King Alistair?

As for Leliana I think her faith is touching, but again perhaps misguided. It's clear the Chantry are no bunch of Angels and being committed  to such a rigid, often cruel, religion seems more dangerous in the long run than allowing her to embrace her love of adventure and intrigue.

So what say you people? Does 'hardening' have a bad rep? Could it simply be a way of convincing your capable but misguided companions that all is not well with their naive world views? You could argue the cause of opening their minds and setting them free! Or is this just giving them an excuse to be dicks?

Please give in game examples to bolster your arguments if you can think of any. I'd really love to read what you think on this subject!"	t5_2r8lo	True

What do I do with it? Is there anything worth buying? Is it worth donating any (all?) to the Redcliffe knights? Does cash carry over to the DLC campaigns and can I use it there?

First: What do you all think of that Architect's deal and whether that decision is going to have any big consequences later? I wanted ask him so many questions about his goals, but felt like I had so little info to go on. I eventually decided to turn him down since he made no promise to stop experimenting on people or stealing women to make them brood mothers or taking wardens for their blood. I hesitated mostly because while a thinking general can potentially negotiate peace, he never gave me any impression that he would be willing to do so, and was afraid I'd end up with an endless blight led by a smart leader, instead of the normal wave of mindless monsters every few hundred years. But then my companions (Nathanial and Oghren) disapproved my choice and made me doubt my reasoning. 

Second: What happened at the end of Witch Hunt? I talked to Morrigan, she told me the book we were looking for was nearby, plus an item I'd find very interesting. Then she went through the mirror and credits. What was the interesting item? Why did the Tevinter statue tell Finn they'd never speak again? He seemed fine in my game, and wanted to go back to the tower. Do we know what happened after the credits?

I think it's safe to assume that most here are fans of the game. I'm considering purchasing it. I have a question or two before I do, however.


1.) As a primarily final fantasy fan, how would this compare? I watched the IGN review and the battle system reminded me of FF12... a kind of mmo-styled rpg look.

2.) The battle system on there lead me to wonder, is it an mmo or a single-player rpg? (I'd prefer the latter)

EDIT 3.) Also, I'm a hugely story-driven kind of guy. Is it jawsome? 


I haven't given the various postings about this game too much of a look for fear of spoilers, so any help would be appreciated. If it's a single-player rpg where I can create my own main character, that seems like it would be pretty neat.

-----------------
When Anlessa awoke, she found herself in a soft feather bed in a cozy room, lit with radiant light streaming in from tall windows facing East.  The morning light was warm and heartening, and she found herself smiling just by looking around the room… her room.  A light buzzing from the foot of the bed drew her attention, and she peeked over the footboard to see her Mabari dozing away on the rug, bathing in a pool of sunlight.

Anlessa grinned and slipped out of bed, sneaking up on the hound as stealthily as possible, and pouncing on him in a surprise attack.  The hound yelped, then snarled, powerful jaws snapping fruitlessly as she laughed and hid her face behind his great neck, her arms wrapped tightly beneath his forelegs.

“You’re so ferocious!” she mocked, tickling his belly as he struggled to right himself.  “Such a ferocious puppy, you are!”

Finally submitting to his mistress, the Mabari whined pitifully and she released him to right himself and bound about the room.  “Yes, yes,” she responded to his plaintive barks, “We’ll go get breakfast from Nan shortly.  Hold your horses.”

Anlessa threw open her wardrobe to decide what to wear for the day, and was greeted by a multitude of fine brightly-dyed gowns in silks, linens and wools.  She considered carefully, trying to ignore an itching at the base of her skull that was making her uneasy, and more than a bit uncomfortable.  Something wasn’t quite right – what was it?  Sharp barks from her hound drew her out of her reverie, and a commanding knock sounded on her door.

“Anlessa!” cried a voice from the corridor outside, “Please tell me you’re not still sleeping in there at this time of day.”

The voice was familiar, and Anlessa felt her heart jump into her throat when she heard it.  Suddenly, she was feeling nauseous; hope and fear warring within her heart as she began to remember why simply waking up in her own room was no longer considered ‘normal.’

“Mother…?”

The door opened and the matron of the Cousland clan stepped in with every bit of poise and propriety that Anlessa had remembered her bearing.  Her steel grey hair was tightly pulled into an intricate and elegantly braided bun at the back of her head, and she gazed upon her daughter with stern but loving eyes.  Seeing the shock on her daughter’s face, her countenance softened and she smiled gently.  “Oh, dear girl.  You look like you’ve seen a ghost.  Did you have that nightmare, again?”

Anlessa watched in disbelief as her mother walked to her and put her arms around her, giving her a firm and reassuring embrace.  She pulled her only daughter tight to her bosom, pressing her cheek warmly against the girl’s.  “My poor dear.  I loathe seeing you suffer from these wretched dreams.  Even after seeing your father and brother return from Ostagar with your own eyes, you still fear their loss, it seems.”

Anlessa broke her mother’s embrace and sat on her bed in shock, trying desperately to remember the dream she awoke from, clinging to it as she struggled to understand what her mother was saying.  The Teyrna shouldn’t be here, and neither should the rest of her family.  “They returned?  But father never made it – Arl Howe…”

Eleanor sat gently next to her daughter, taking the girl’s hand in hers and patting it reassuringly.  “Renden Howe joined your father and brother as planned and took our combined forces to Ostagar, my dear.  You know this.  You stayed behind and had an altogether uneventful time here at the castle while Lady Landry and I traveled to Denerim together to enjoy the markets.  Our men returned triumphant with the fiends defeated just two months later.”

“But the Blight, the Grey Wardens –“

Eleanor shook her head and sighed, as if she’d had to explain this dozens of times before.  “There was never any Blight.  Our own Ser Gilmore was recruited into the ranks of the Grey Wardens, and joined their forces at Ostagar.  They soundly defeated the incursion, which retreated immediately back underground.  It was no more than a surface raid, from what your father reported.”

As her mother spoke, Anlessa found it easier to remember this dream – the smell of the castle burning, the pain of the Joining, waking in the Wilds to discover a witch she had once thought was no more than a myth had saved her from certain demise.  The more she concentrated, the easier it was to remember, and to recognize where her true reality lay.  Looking at her mother sternly, she rose and pronounced, “It is a lie.  I am a Grey Warden, I survived Ostagar, I will stop this Blight, and I have a duty that lies before me.”

Eleanor stood in anger and grasped her daughter by the shoulders, shaking her firmly.  From the floor, a low pitiful whine sounded from the Mabari.  “Stop this!  Your duty is here, to Highever, and to your family.  Your duty is to serve your father and I, and to marry and continue the Cousland family line.  You must stop with this childish game of make-believe in which you aim to be savior of the world, Anlessa!”

Anlessa’s lip jutted forward in defiance as she struggled to hold her emotions in check.  “My duty is to protect this country from the Blight, and to take our vengeance on Arl Howe, Mother.  You know this.  I know you do.”

The woman before her deflated, and she sat slowly on the feather bed as clouds passed overhead and the glorious light in the room dimmed.  With sad eyes, she looked to the floor and shook her head.  Her skin paled visibly as she replied, “My child, you were always so strong willed.  There’s no telling you anything when you have your mind set on your goals.”

Anlessa smiled, and kneeled before her mother, taking the woman’s cold hands in her own.  Squeezing gently, she replied, “I learned that from you, Mother.  I can’t thank you enough for all that you’ve taught me.”

Dark circles developed slowly under the Teyrna’s eyes.  “You won’t stay?  Fergus will be here shortly.  I know your father would want to see you, as well.  We’ve missed you so.”

Tears stung at the back of Anlessa’s eyes, and she blinked them back as she shook her head.  “No, Mother.  I cannot waste any more time, here – no matter how desperately I may want to.”

Eleanor leaned down, her chilled blue lips pressed to her daughter’s forehead as the girl sighed audibly, holding her emotions in check at the familiar touch.  “Then go, my daughter.  Take the blessings of your family with you.”  She looked down at the young woman and brushed wisps of raven-black hair from the girl’s face.  “My beautiful girl.  I am so proud of you.”

Anlessa was then completely alone, the room dark as pitch and stained with the soot from a long-dead fire, her bed burned to no more than cinders as she knelt beside it.  Hanging her head in anguish and regret, Anlessa wept."	t5_2r8lo	True

1347463884.0	zrpoa	Thoughts on the future?	adokretz	17	0	33	"So we're in the middle of a dry period, basically waiting for anything hinting at DA:3. What are your expectations to a possible DA:3? Are you expecting a new Origins kind of game, or an ""established"" character like Hawke. Have you given up on the series? If so, do you have any ideas to what a new series could give us that a new DA game couldn't?

I'll share my opinions. I loved Origins, and I thought DA:2 was a fine game. A disappointment, even though it was a good game. I do believe that the series is much alive and if they make a magnificent 3 they could give the series a rebirth and maybe even start a trilogy, with a character following through (like Shepard in Mass Effect). I would like to choose my background like in Origins, race would be cool as well but it's not a must. I liked Hawke, but I think too much was decided beforehand. You might disagree, and that's fine. But please elaborate on it, then.

I would love a voiced character following through to the next game, making the many choices of the series much more important, if they decide that this won't be the last game (which we all hope for, I think). I didn't feel too much of my choices in DA:2 as I had hoped, and it could be fixed with a character being imported into the next game in the series.

I think it's safe and unquestionable to say that another DA game is inevitable, there's so much lore yet to explore (I've unpurposely become great lyricist just now). I want to hear your opinion(s).

Merrill got killed, but took out a lot of the floor enemies, which I as Hawke finished off. By the time I got up the stairs it was Arishok and one of his people versus Anders, Aveline, and Hawke. Someone (Anders?) froze him and by the time I got up there with Hawke, he was pretty much done for.

1341954401.0	wcjr3	Dragon Age Pen and Paper. (Story Inside)	AlludingIllusion	18	0	5	"So I've been GMing the pen and paper version of Dragon Age. For anyone that has never tried a pen and paper game, this is a good, simplified start in a universe that I adore.  I thought I'd offer one of my more...interesting experiences with the game.  Note that I'm not going to describe every roll and check that occurred.

*Setup: I GM a group of 4 adventurers. A human apostate (Jericho), elf circle mage (Elora), human warrior (Rylin), and elf rogue (Achima).  They are quite an obnoxious bunch and had been causing a lot of trouble for people.*

*Key Facts: Only Rylin wears steel armor; the rest wear leather or none.*

I had the group meet a female elf seeking safe passage and they offered to take her through part of the Bannorn to get to her home.  The group traveled on with her and eventually nighttime game and so they made camp in an abandoned tower.

The elf offered everyone in the group some wine and jerky. Elora and Jericho both drank some of the wine without reservations.  Achima and Rylin declined.  Immediately after, Achima stayed up to guard while the rest of the group went to sleep.  The elf stayed up with her.

After some time the elf came up to Achima who then failed both a perception and dex test to see a hidden blade and to dodge it.  The elf stabbed Achima with a poison blade who then immediately went limp and fell to the group paralyzed but awake.  

Rylin heard the noise and stood up yelling.  Both Elora and Jericho woke up but were also paralyzed and failed constitution tests on the poison.  Only Rylin stood between this elf and her killing the entire group.

The elf threw a hidden vile of a green substance as Rylin charged her.  It hit him directly in the chest and the vile burst on his armor.  It was at this point that the liquid starting burning through his armor and some of it managed to fall onto Achima, burning through her armor as well.  

Rylin ""stunted"" or ""critted"" the elf and lopped her in half.  He immediately ripped all the clothes and armor off Achima to prevent any damage to her.  He then searched the dead elf women but rolled horribly.  He found a file of white swirling liquid and a vile of green liquid, similar to that which was thrown at him.  He also found a crow tattooed on her arm as well as an assortment of scars.

Rylin thought that one of them was the antidote so he poured some of both of them on the ground.  Each of the substances fizzed and bubbled on the dirt.  Rylin, not thinking very much, poured some of the white liquid into Jericho's mouth (a little bit of bad blood exists between the two) at which point Jericho failed a constitution check and he begin vomiting uncontrollably.

Rylin panicked because Jericho started vomiting blood.  Rylin proceeded to try and force some of the green liquid down the throat of the vomiting Jericho.  This failed miserably as Jericho just vomited it back onto Rylin's armor which started to burn and melt like earlier.

Rylin proceeded to take off his arm and run around the room in a panic.  He then re-searched the dead elf's lower half where he rolled well enough to notice a compartment on the elf's boots.  Instead of searching for a means to open the compartment he bashed it in with his sword and a loud crack was heard. 

Immediately after bashing it in with his sword, a purple liquid started seeping from the compartment (he had broken the vile inside).  Knowing that Jericho was in immediate danger, Rylin ripped the boot off and ran over to Jericho who was still failing constitution checks and had began taking damage.

Here's where it gets ridiculous: Rylin decided the only way he could save Jericho was to get this purple liquid (which was the antidote) into Jericho by any means possible.  Rylin took off his gauntlets and  rubbed the purple liquid all over his hands, ripped off Jericho's pants, and shoved his hand up Jericho's anus.  I had Rylin roll to see if any damage was done, Rylin rolled so high on both attack and damage that he rendered Jericho unconscious.

The day ended up being saved but at the Jericho's cost.  Many jokes were made after that point and a new ""bromance"" was formed.

I could not stop laughing throughout this entire encounter. It was not how I saw the situation going at all. But yeah, that's one of my most *interesting* moments in the Pen and Paper game. Sorry for the length.

**TLDR: Group gets poisoned.  Mage is vomiting and on verge of death. Warrior decides best way to administer antidote is to cover his hand in the antidote and ANALY FIST the Mage, rendering him unconscious but cured.**

1340487985.0	vhyh3	Where do you think DA3 will and what would you like to be in it?	LonnieIII	17	1	30	"There's a lot of heat building up. You've got the Qunari who, if I recall correctly, are already at war with the Tevinter Imperium plus, as stated by Sten, plan on invading Ferelden eventually. You also have the Mage/Templar war going on, thanks to Anders, with the Seekers of the Chantry apparently looking for both Hawke and the Hero of Ferelden. Then there's the issue of Morrigan's child and where they're going to with that. To top it all off you still have the Darkspawn with two remaining Archdemons. Do you guys think they'll have DA3 be a shit storm that you alone have to fix or do you feel like putting all of that into one game will feel like they're trying to rush through the series? What if the last two Archdemons are found around the same time? Would that be an interesting new fight or would it be lame and feel rushed? What about characters to play as and teammates? I thought it might be interesting if they had 4 Dragon Age games and you could play as four of your main characters. So you have the Hero of Ferelden (or Savior, as stated in the epilogue of DA:Awakening), Hawke, Morrigan's child (I believe that they'll make the child a playable character) and then a fourth main character (I don't know who could fit that role. Commander Shepard, I guess lol :P) But anyway, playing as all four of your customized characters I think could be cool.

Those are just some of my thoughts. Any other opinions on what could/should be in the third one?

1340385517.0	vfzbu	Is there a trick to DA:O's combat? Or is it simply supposed to be hard?		21	3	33	"I picked up DA:O (1) during a recent sale and started my first playthrough on Normal difficulty. And I find the combat to be excessively hard at times.

Mind you, I didn't stumble into this unprepared. I consider myself somewhat of a cRPG veteran, having played pretty much all of Bioware's RPGs, the various Fallouts, Arcanum, Sacred etc. I don't mind a challenge and I enjoy a well done difficulty curve (solo-playthrough of BG2/ToB on a higher difficulty with a Fighter/Mage/Thief was highly entertaining), and I usually prepare my party for combat - synnergies, decent balance of melee/ranged and the likes.

Yet in most fights in DA:O, I'll have to start using Heals mere seconds into the fight. I'm currently running with Alistair, Morrigan, my dog and a Rogue as my PC, all of them around lvl 8. I just had to drop the difficulty to ""Easy"" because I really wasn't in the mood to slough out the fight against that elven assassin; Alistair had barely connected with the first few enemies and he was half dead already. Or that fight in Redcliffe before you enter the castle; the Revenant took my half a dozen tries and even on the successful attempt, I blew through at least a dozen healing poultices. With Alistair using Threaten, he gets demolished even quicker; if I'm not using it, the rest of my party gets smashed.

I try using the terrain, flanking the enemies, buying and equipping better weapons and armor whenever I run across a new merchant but all of that usually devolves into frantically hitting heals and hoping to drop the baddies before they drop me. Combat really isn't fun like that.

So am I making some fundamental mistake there, have I missed something? Or is the game simply supposed to be that hard even on Normal?"	t5_2r8lo	True

**[1) Aveline](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Aveline) Human Warrior (f)**

Aveline Vallen is a soldier, a master of sword and shield, and a tireless guardian... to a point. The daughter of an exiled chevalier, Aveline is not the knight her father wished her to be. Although fully trained in chivalrous combat, she was raised in the shadow of a lost life and will not lose another for the sake of honor. Protecting her adopted home of Kirkwall becomes a chosen duty, not a privileged calling. The people she stands for will not be wasted on lost causes or protecting the foolish from themselves. Pride can be bandaged like any other wound—when threats are dead and everyone is safely home.

**[2) Fenris](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Fenris) Elf Warrior (m)**

Once slave to a Tevinter magister, Fenris was altered: lyrium was burned into his flesh, its magic both stripping his memory as well as changing him forever. He became a living weapon, and eventually used his power to escape his chains. Now he finds himself in a strange land with no friends—and a former master that refuses to let him be.

**[3) Isabella](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Isabela)  Human Rogue (f)**

Isabela is the pirate scourge of two coastlines, four nations, and countless tavern floors. She's equally skilled with dagger and insult, and it's hard to know which cuts deeper. It's rare to see her in one place for long, but with her ship reduced to timbers, Isabela's had to content herself with whatever bounty Kirkwall has to offer. And that means no end of headaches for the rich and foolish, and no end of amusement for her. She's as desired as she is feared, which is to say, a lot and often. Fall on her blade, or at her feet—a win is a win, in her book. Shipwrecked, hounded, Isabela hasn't decided if she's cornered yet. She's having too much fun.

Also, she was in Dragon Age: Origins - she teaches the *dueling* specialization in the Denerim tavern.

**[4) Merrill](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Merrill) Elf Mage (f)**

Merrill is the apprentice of the clan's Keeper, Marethari. She is interested in recovering the elves' lost lore and possesses some knowledge of the elves' old magic. 

She was also involved in the Daelish Elf origin in Dragon Age: Origins.

**[5) Varric](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Varric) Dwarf Rogue (m)**

Words are his trade, exaggeration his specialty—Varric can make or break a legend without lifting a finger. Born into a merchant guild, Varric never knew a dwarven homeland, and has never worked the Stone. He prefers a warm tavern fire, a mug that never empties, a willing audience, and an unwilling subject. He can spin a grand story of Ancestors and Paragons—or anything you like—but it’s not out of reverence. Truth is just another commodity. History is written by the victors, but it can also be written by Varric, who then decides the victors. If you want profit, look to his brother, Bartrand, a scoundrel with a true head for business. But if you want to be remembered, Varric is your man.

Varric also serves as the game narrator.  (I already like this guy)

**[6)  Anders](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Anders) [{Featuring Justice?}](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Justice)  Human Mage (m), Spirit of the Fade**

Anders, the light-hearted rebel mage from Dragon Age: Origins, Awakening, has changed. Urged by his friend Justice to fight the Circle of Magi more actively, Anders agreed to become Justice's human host… only to find that his anger at the Circle warped Justice into the demonic spirit of Vengeance. Now Anders must struggle mentally and physically to maintain his control over the demon within... at least long enough to see the Circle of Magi overturned forever.

Despite the various epilogues of Awakening, Anders left the Wardens to live in Kirkwall, where he uses his healing abilities to aid refugees in the city.

Justice at some point urged his friend Anders to fight the Circle of Magi more actively, and Anders agreed to become Justice's human host… only to find that his anger at the Circle turned Justice into a demon.


**[7) Sebastian Vael](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Sebastian_Vael) Human Rogue (m)**

Sworn to the priesthood as a boy, Sebastian is forced to re-enter the viper's nest of princely politics when his family is brutally murdered, leaving him as the sole surviving heir.

Sebastian is a downloadable content character.

**[8a) Bethany Hawke](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Bethany) Human Mage (f)**

Bethany Hawke is Hawke's younger sister and Carver's fraternal twin. Bethany is an apostate mage; she received her magical training from her father, who was also an apostate.  Bethany will have one of several facial structures, depending on which preset the player starts character creation with for their Hawke. Furthermore her skin tone will also be matched with Hawke's while her hair will always be black to prevent clash of dark skin and fair hair. The same applies for Carver and Leandra.

If the player is a mage, Bethany will die in place of Carver.

**[8b) Carver Hawke](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Carver) Human Warrior (m)**

Carver Hawke is Hawke's younger brother, and Bethany's fraternal twin. Carver is a warrior.  Carver will have one of several facial structures, depending on which preset the player starts character creation with for their Hawke.

Carver can be killed during the attack on Lothering when an Ogre smashes his head. However, if Hawke is a mage, then Bethany will die in Carver's place

My part is Main (Wizard), Alistair, Wynn and Liliana. Aside from the obvious chest benefits, Liliana is my primary anti-mage weapon. She quickly crosses the line and goes into the backfield, stuns the target and proceeds to chain-backstab them.

I've added paralysis runes to her weapons and this helps generate those backstab's as well. Right now I'm getting backstab's in the 40-50 point range, and with double daggers she attacks like lightning. 

I'm level 15 or 16 and I'm almost tempted to go with a double rogue party because they just pour out the single target dps. I can shatter 2, 3 and sometimes 4 enemies off a single cone of cold, and the ability to stop a mage from casting Chain Lightning or Fireball has really made a difference.

Personally, I think specifying the appropriate aggression setting plus setting up a rule where the character heals itself with a potion or spell if it gets sufficiently hurt will make a huge difference especially in boss battles, and you can set up your warrior or dog to go after anything that tries to melee your wizard, too, but there are still a lot of leeway there to get an optimal setup.

I dispatched the Broodmother without failing once, but Branka and her golems are giving far more trouble. Anyone on here completed nightmare and have any advice?

My party is me (a mage focussed on battlefield control - healing and paralysis), Oghren, Shale as the tank and Morrigan for more damaging spells. I'm restricted to two health poultices, and can't go back to an older save because I'm stupid. 

The Golems seem almost impossible to kill, but I've done it (once). Thing is, by the time I'm there, I've expended all my resources and half the party are dead. Branka then just steamrolls through everyone I have. I figure if I could kill the golems faster, I'd be able to deal with her better (hopefully), but those guys are pretty powerful on their own.

First is Connor at the end DA:O when talking to Arl Eamon he asks if the warden noticed Connor behaving strangely. So I was wondering if anyone had any clue what was up with that. Side note I got the lyrium and sent Jowain in to kill the demon no talking just attacked.  

The other is a bit of a odd theory. The short version Flemeth is Andraste. There's not a lot of substantial evidence but a lot of coincidental/anecdotal evidence. First is there is some hints in DA:O that Andraste is a mage (the book you can give Wynne along with some dialog). Using her magic we know she can create more then one of herself and she can abandon her body and poses a new one allowing the urn of sacred ashes to exist. We also know that a fragment of the original guardians believe the dragon is Andraste reborn and that dragon is the same type of dragon that Flemeth can change into. The dalish have a unique title for her and have respect for her although she is a human (or at least looks like one most of the time) so it is possible that they remember to respect/fear her but not know she is Andraste because of lost records and stories. Lastly we know stories have been changed and fabricated and even though they are old dose not mean they are true given Morigan's claim that the stories about he mother are mostly false. 

So dose any one else have a kinda odd theorys to share? "	t5_2r8lo	True

So my plan for the playthrough is this:
Romance Leliana and get the ""Wine, Woman and Song"" achievement (which I for some reason don't have although I have romanced her before, possible bug?), romance Morrigan and break it off with Leliana (already have ""Witch Gone Wild"" but Morrigan's fun so whatever), romance Zevran, get the ""Easy Lover"" achievement and break it off with Morrigan, have a foursome at the Pearl, kill Leliana at the Urn and perform the Ultimate Sacrifice to go out with a boom.

In that order.
So, first things first, is it possible at all to romance three people in one playthrough? Also, can I have the foursome at the Pearl even if I have already dumped Leliana when I go there, is the hardening and approval the only criteria for her to accept? 
We all know DA:O has its bugs when it comes to approval and romances so if there are any that might mess with my evil mastermind plan I'd love to be informed of them.

1372462576.0	1ha4st	What are your character hooks?	the_atheist_roommate	18	3	0	"When I'm making a new character, I often use achievements as a starting point for their personality. For example, the Great Minds Think Alike achievement, where you have to be friends or rivals with 4 characters, is really good for this. These kinds of achievements can double as combat challenges, since I can't always default to the party I'm most comfortable with.

I thought it might be fun to come up with our own ""achievements""/challenges. Some examples might be:

**Bloody Hypocrite:** rise to power in Kirkwall and Starkhaven as a blood mage (I want to do this one after my current playthrough)

**All Spirits Are Dangerous:** neither you nor your companions may take skills in the Spirit Healer or Blood Magic trees when leveling up, nor may they take the specialization bonus from either school

**Chantry Boy/Girl:** chests in buildings may not be looted, because stealing is wrong

**Protective:** unless they are required, the player's LI may not participate in any combat - if this results in them not having enough of a relationship with the PC, then the PC has an unrequited crush or a broken heart

I really love taking up a role as a specific character inbetween other like-minded individuals. I would suggest written roleplay through either a forum or something similar. 

Story, Year, Setting, Location .. Everything will be decided on a later date but I would love to hear ideas.

It'd require somewhat maturity to be able to work as it takes a lot of effort to actually become succesful and fun for **everyone**.

1350614551.0	11q6wt	Viability of a Strength Based Rogue in Origins?	LightningStack	18	3	27	"After playing both a DW warrior and a DW cunning based rogue, I've found that the rogue far out classes the DW warrior in pure DPS due in no small part to the back-stab multiplier. On the other hand, the warrior had significantly higher survivability do to high grade armor. Which got me thinking: what if you were to combine the survivability of a warrior with the back-stab potential of a rogue. 

Attributes: First, points in dex to get the DW talents (min 36). Minimum 38 strength to wear Evon the Great's Mail with Wade's Superior gloves &amp; boots which will give you a low fatigue rating. The remainder in cunning to get IV coercion and added armor penetration. 

Specializations: Duelist &amp; Bard up until distraction. 

Talents: Obviously all of the DW tree. Almost all in the Dirty Fighting tree except Feign Death. All but one skill in the Dirty Fighting Tree could be used effectively since only Lethality is cunning dependent. 

Result: Dirty Fighting, Riposte and Distraction will set up your Coup de Grace passive scoring an instant back-stab. Suppose the enemy doesn't get stunned, which is the case of most elite bosses. No worries! You're strength based rogue can go toe to toe with that Revenant until your tank takes the aggro so you can swoop behind for the back-stab. 

Of course this is all theoretical but, it seems somewhat viable. Has anyone tried this? If so, how effective were you at dispatching things?

It is an unnatural high, but not dangerous. How could they know? They look at us like monsters, not people with hearts. To their eyes we are all potential monsters. I know I am not a monster, but sometimes I wonder. I have been in the Circle for only ten years. I was not taken in till I was 10. I know that magic can hurt people, but cannot a sword do the same? I hear of mages who rebel against our overlords, use blood magic to get their ways. I would never do that, could never do that. I can’t help but sometimes imagine it though, but only in private. Those eyes….they can see into your very thoughts, and I don’t want the next rite of tranquility done just because I thought of it.  I sometimes wonder if I could ever run away. I wouldn’t resort to blood magic to do it, not that our watchers care.  Where would I go? Somewhere away from circles perhaps.  I have read about the Tevinter Imperium, about how terrible and wild it is there. No, they may admire mages there, but not even a mage could escape the evil they infested themselves with. See, I am getting stared at because I lost myself in daydreams. Why are they in the Library anyway? Do they think we will pick up and book and just start turning into an abomination? My mentor wouldn’t be pleased that I’m not studying, but what does she care? She’s under their thumbs like an insect. If she doesn’t obey them, she will be squashed. Maybe if I go to my room instead? I will tell them I have a headache. Although they won’t actually ask me what’s wrong- it’s hard not to answer their hard stares. Why is the First Enchanter coming over to me? Have I done something wrong? He can’t know that I was the one who froze the privy stalls in the dormitory, on a dare.  He wants me to come with him, he looks sad. I’m starting to panic; Templars are everywhere, why am I going to the Harrowing Chamber? I’m not ready for that! No….everything is wrong. Why are the Tranquil here? The atmosphere is stifling. The First Enchanter says only two words, and I know what is wrong. He’s sorry? I know now what is happening, it is the Rite of Tranquility. No! I won’t do it. I haven’t done anything wrong, but they won’t listen to my pleas. I ask them, over and over again, why they are doing this. They draw their swords because I resist. My blood rushes, I can hear it in my ears. It carries so much magic in it. I know what I have to do. With great ferocity I bite down on my arm, causing blood to spill out. I will kill them, the ones who have pushed me to this evil. I will kill the Templars.

Now I have a laptop capable of running modern games so I grabbed what was one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of my life when I saw it on sale. Previously, I started the awakening expansion with excitement right after finishing the main game, psyched that my time as the Grey Warden was not over. However, that enthusiasm soon turned to boredom. I can't remember why exactly but something about it just didn't feel right to me, it was not the same. I stopped and never looked back after about an hour or two. A few months later I played Witch Hunt when it came out, which I found to pretty much suck but was worth it to see Morrigan at the end....

1339168533.0	urnwd	DA2 vs DA:O	Actus3	28	14	48	"I played DA2 frequently and thoroughly the past six months, and very much enjoyed the game. I played the whole campaign as a Mage, Rogue, 2H Warrior and Sword and Board Warrior. I bought all the DLC. Then I read some threads in here that Origins was even better, so a few days ago I bought the DA:O Ultimate edition. 

I was shocked at my gameplay experience. I've made it through about an hour of gameplay, and I'm ready to quit. I'm bored. I'm posting this to solicit your opinion as to whether I should keep trying, or quit based on what I like in a game. Here are the things that are bugging me:

* The immersiveness of the dialogue/story is lost for me, mostly because my character just stares, mute at the character with whom I'm interacting.
* There seems to be no purpose to the dialogue. Often there are five or more options, and no consequences or difference in picking any of the choices. 
* The dialogue is LONG. I was listening to characters' entire speeches on my 3rd run through with DA2, and now I'm skipping portions of dialogue on my 1st run.
* I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with the tradeskills - am I really going to be setting traps at some point?

I don't know, the speed of the story is just not compelling to me (I started as a mage), like DA:2 is, where you're grabbed by the throat and sent down raging rapids along the storyline. This feels more like poling a raft through a swamp.

Thoughts? I should mention that I'm a casual gamer with two kids and can't play for more than an hour or two (max) at a time."	t5_2r8lo	True
1338775418.0	ujhfs	UPDATE: Nub to DA:O	naked_avenger	19	6	30	"I have to say, I made a great decision purchasing this game. Someone suggested I give my newbie impressions of the game, so I shall!

First off, I'm only a few hours in the Human Warrior storyline, just leaving the area where I acquire Sten. The story is engaging. I'm enjoying it greatly. It's a little difficult for me to keep track of the universe, given that I'm so familiar with the Final Fantasy universe, but the Codex makes it easy to check to cure my confusion. The characters certainly are a draw and I appreciate the focus on character development. The casual commentary as I run around is fantastic. Alistair in particular is probably my favorite at this point. 

I do like the mmo style battle system. As I referenced on the other thread, it reminds me of FF12. I still prefer FF12 battling because I feel it looks cleaner, but that could be due to the fact that I'm playing on a ps3 and cannot quite get a high enough camera angle. I also prefer FF12's gambit system more, but that may be due to the fact that I'm not as familiar with the Tactics system at this point. (Admittedly, I'm playing on Casual mode simply so I can enjoy the story, so take that into consideration)

I'm not a fan of the excessive blood splatter, not because I frown upon it, as I actually prefer blood be shown, but because it's more akin to a Japanese splatter film. It seems a little ridiculous to cut a wolf once, and suddenly my entire party has blood everywhere. It does add some comical value in the heart felt scenes after a battle. I look deeply into Liliana's eyes, as she speaks with blood draped across her mouth. I guess she got her red wings, eh? :P

Another lighter grievance is when I'm purchasing gear, I can only check it against the character I'm currently controlling. Granted, that may be because I haven't thought about hitting R1 or something (which I just thought of), so that could be little more than newbie bitching on my part. 

It's been suggested that I try each race's initial story line before I move one, but I can't do it. I'm too engaged. I can already tell that I will absolutely be replaying this, so I'll wait until then.

My friend, Mike, turned me onto DA:O saying it was a great RPG. So I picked it up from GameStop today and popped it in. I've been playing for about an hour or two and have been struggling a bit to understand how exactly the combat works. 

I'm sorry if I'm a bit confusing, but the tutorial didn't really explain things all that much for me.

* I understand [these](http://i.imgur.com/xwqpYe8.png) sorta represent skills and are quick commands to get them. - But when I active some of them, I don't know if they're working or not. 

* I know that I can [switch in between characters](http://i.imgur.com/fdJ5SJk.png), like to my dog, but what's the point? And is it necessary or can I just play as my character the entire game? 

* Things are a bit hectic when playing on the console. I believe because it might be in real-time? (correct me if I'm wrong), can I make it turn based or something like on the PC? -- Also combat seems a bit slow, is it suppose to be? 

---

Again, I'm so sorry for my stupidity, I have played Bioware RPGs in the past, but it's been 7 years and I'm a bit clueless. Please help.

There are quite a few posts that are great to read through, getting different interpretations of characters and story events is always refreshing. Anyways, the past couple of days i've noticed that there is not a lot of Templar support on the forums. This is understandable of course, as the Templars are seen as oppressors and tyrants by most of your party in DA2. I've always respected the Templar order for what it is. 

Like any large organization there are bad seeds, this is unavoidable, but at it's core the Templar Order exists to protect the magi from themselves and from demons. Cullen is an example of a ""good"" Templar, seen very clearly if you side with the [Templars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcikSLufaHg&amp;feature=related) at the end of the game. Many of the Templars you face in DA2 are the evil and sadistic ones that are too afraid of mages to understand what their primary goal really is, to protect.

I suppose this post is to discuss what /r/da thinks of the Templar Order, it'd be interesting to find out. I've always thought of them as a necessary force that is as imperfect as the world it is in.

I played through Origins and really enjoyed it, and I have Awakenings and DA2.  When I went to start up Awakenings, I saw that there was the option to import my warden from origins.  At the end of Origins, [Alistair became king, my warden rejected Morrigan's proposition, he got it on with all available but stayed in a relationship with Zevran, and sacrificed himself to destroy the Archdemon.](/spoiler)

My question is, do these conditions at the end remain as part of the story in Awakenings, and eventually 2?  I did start off with importing and played for about five minutes, but didn't like [that no one seemed to be reacting to my apparently resurrected/zombie warden.](/spoiler)  I imagine that if I simply start with a new warden for Awakenings, they will just give me some standardized version of the history in Origins.  I'd really like to have the best of both worlds and [leave my warden dead while still importing my other storyline points](/spoiler), but I imagine that's not a possibility.

So does anything I've mentioned even matter as far as the story in the subsequent games?  Or am I trying too hard to leave my own storyline as-is when it won't end up mattering that much?  I'm a huge fan of the Mass Effect series, so I was assuming that the decision making in this game is as important as it was in Mass Effect.  Any clarification/advice would be much appreciated.

&gt; Loghain: I am no longer a teyrn, nor even a knight. Address me without a title, as you would any other Grey Warden. 

&gt; Zevran: So just Loghain, then?

&gt; Loghain: I thought you looked familiar.

&gt; Zevran: I'm terribly broken up over it.

Loghain: Gracious as you please. Drier than dust.


And for DA2, the bitterness-o-rama of following a Fenris romance with an [Anders](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Anders/Dialogue#Anders_and_Fenris) one. I just love how it so perfectly sets up...let's see...Fenris hating mages and Fenris shredding people to work through his frustrations.

1311873693.0	j2cga	Wishing Your Origins Ending Had More Impact...		14	3	4	"So who else really, really hopes that EA will have the decency to make your origins file actually relevant to future sequels? I had a human noble rogue who was a complete Machiavellian sociopath, but who fell in love with Morrigan utterly. She was the first and only thing that ever elicited emotion in him. He was otherwise just concerned with ruthless efficiency and obtaining max power. I was extremely satisfied to see them go into the Black City together to raise their demon child together, and I want to know what is going on with that... The idea of Morrigan and my Warden overcoming their natures (for want of a better phrase) and finally trusting and accepting another soul seems so poetic, if not also devastating, potentially, to the DA story line. Who knows what they would do with an arch demon baby, in the Black City, no less.... It just seems like a love story, in a dark, macabre way...

So I suppose what I am asking is this: How do you think EA will implement (read:fuck up) the story-import mechanic... Do you think your origins and da2 files will actually shape the larger gameworld we will hopefully see in future games, or are they just going to determine small references to things.... Because Morrigan going into the Black City seems very, very important to me. I wonder if Flemeth even knows shes doing this... and with my Warden, no less... 

EDIT: I mean, you can either kill Leliana outright or pretty much lead her to kill herself due to a broken heart in certain outcomes, but when you import such a file form origins OH LOOK, THERE SHE IS IN DA2! SURPRISE! She even had such a personality as to suggest that the hardening/softening RP decision you make for her in origins didn't even occur. This is just carelessness and lack of consideration for lore, in my opinion, and I'm hoping future games have more of a spirit of epic and emotive story telling and not just ""BUTTON-AWESOME!""

I use a bow and arrow and I have my archery tree maxed out and I invested the rest of my ability points into the Assassin tree.

~I will post the others later today~

The battle isn't the one-on-one, I don't have that option to do so (Although I hear that fighting him one-on-one is harder). Like I said the battles are quick (around 2 mins). It's the Qunari mages that get the most of me. 

By the time I kill the mages I'm almost dead, use a health potion, Arishok attacks, I'm half dead again, can't heal, start running around to waste time to heal again, mage spawns from nowhere, kills me.

""As the Chantry’s oppression of the mages comes to a head in the opening of Inquisition, a Fade tear splits the sky, leading dragons and other monsters into the fray, “and that kicks off the events."" Following that, nations plunge into war, and “the decision is made to bring back an inquisition to find out what’s going on and stop this,” 

The ""Nations"" part intrigues me obviously it is most likely going to be set in Orlais but I have seen some people say that from the trailer it looks like the Anderfels as well and obviously we also see the Qunari in the trailer also. Now if the Qunari are in it is there then a possibility of involvement from Tevinter? Maybe even Rivain which has a Qunari settlement (even though they have a peace treaty there may still be some of the population of Rivain that want the Qunari gone).

1370990638.0	1g5m9b	DA3 Open World thoughts?	ForkBreaker	21	10	13	"So, at E3 it was revealed that Dragon Age Inquisition will as opposed to earlier games in the series be a free-roaming open world RPG. This opens up a lot of possibilities and gives the player a bigger sense of freedom when it comes to traveling.
That said, I do **not** approve of this. I believe it was stated some time ago that Ferelden is supposed to be (don't quote me on this) about the size of England. Orlais, the country Inquisition will take place in (along with possibly other regions as well?) is a lot bigger, but even if its size was equal to that of Ferelden it would be nearly impossible to create a game world as big as England. Considering every inch of it would need detail as well, it's not very likely BioWare have succeded in creating such a vast open world. 

So what do you think of this? I personally think this decision will completely shatter the ""logic"" of the universe (yeah it's a fantasy game, but that does not mean it can't be true to *its own* universe), being able to walk from one edge of the map to the other in an hour will in my opinion sort of ruin the feel of traveling with your party miles after miles to get to whatever abandoned ruin you're headed for and again, more importantly it does not make sense that Orlais would be that small to being with. Now I'm not claiming it's going to be small fom gameplay point of view, to be fair we don't even know exactly how big this open world will be, but the fact that it will be one open world just sort of ruined the hype for me.

The friendly mage NPCs spam fireball at it - it's a fire demon let me remind you. Due to playing on hard(friendly AoEs hurt friendlies), they nearly wipe out my party doing this since fireball does a ton of damage then CCs you and does the same amount of damage for a duration.

I manage to pull through it due to my Wynne surviving and reviving/healing us up while we got out of the way of the IDIOT NPC mages. :/

So later in the same area(mage tower), there's a bunch of fade areas you go through solo. I'm going through it fine and then I get to two hostile mages that run out a door and attack me. One of them starts to cast fireball and I try to stop him with crushing prison, but he resists. So I run around a corner...and the fireball follows me around the corner, and kills me while I'm knocked down by it with its burn damage.

I just want people to agree with me that fireball is a stupid spell and it's not my fault so I can move on with my game reminding myself that it's just horribly imbalanced so I shouldn't expect not to randomly die on occasion(I was trying to go through the game w/out ever ""wiping"" and this was my first death).

If there's some build I could viably expect to go through w/out ever wiping, please share - though I haven't unlocked many specializations like arcane warrior or blood mage yet.

1319375033.0	llzg3	My theory about the qunari	LiudvikasT	16	5	12	"I'm currently playing Dragon Age 2 and no matter what you say about the game, I loved to learn more about the qunari. They are fascinating indeed, but their origin is largely unknown.

And my hypothesis is this: they are aliens who crash-landed on the planet, several hundred years ago.
Why do I think so? Let me tell:

1. They appeared rather recently - four centuries ago. Before that no one has any information about them. It's hard to imagine someone like them could hide for long. So the best guess is that they did not live on the planet before that
2. While the whole world is very familiar with magic, the qunari appear to be on the opposite side. Whatever few mages they have, they distrust and even those mages themselves are incomparably weaker than their human/elven counterparts. It would suggest that qunari only recently found out about it. I assume that lyrium is a mineral, that is responsible for magic abilities of some humans. While it's abundant on this planet, it was probably non-existent on their homeworld. When they arrived the contact with the mineral caused some individuals to develop abilities unknown to the qunari. Possibly creating a lot of abominations in the process. And so the qunari deemed magic to be extremely dangerous, even more so than the other races.
3. They appear to be more technologically advanced than other races. They have access to gunpowder, advanced poisons, cannons, navy and so on. While it's not exactly space age technology we must consider that without the worldwide industry to support them, that is about the best a technologically advanced race could do.
4. Lower population. As little as 4 centuries had hard time to increase their population to a size the other races enjoy.


So I assume this is what happened:

At least 4-5 centuries ago a qunari spaceship crashed and they were stranded, with no hope to repair it with resources available to them and with morale declining among the crew, highest ranking officer Ashkaari Koslun saw that without a purpose his crew would scatter in all directions, never to return. And the purpose is clear of course, to push forward technology and industry of the local population so some future descendants could return home. It was obvious that this task would take more than a single generation and with their technology and any evidence gone any future generations would have hard time believing their origins, it would at best turn into myths if not disappear completely. So he created a religion - The Qun. Any society that could send them into space soon, needed to be unquestioning and with single goal. Religion is an obvious choice to achieve it.
So time passed and they began their war to unite the world, it didn't go as planned though, they didn't expect mages, which were a match even to their great technological advantage. With time passing their origins were forgotten as it was predicted and now even with core principles of their mission intact no one knows their true purpose even though they still strive to achieve it. A master plan indeed."	t5_2r8lo	True

I played a mage and went against the templars every step of the way, and uncovered all of Meredith's bulshit, up until the final battle, where I sided with the templars. Why ? Even though it was unjust, it was by far the lesser evil. 

Go with the templars, and you doom (almost) all the mages, even ones who were absolutely innocent, but you have to admit that the vast majority of them is corrupted, and you know that even Orsino is not clean at all, he is just more subtle than Meredith. Agreed, they were forced into this state by the templars, but they are too many blood mages/abominations. 

Side with the mages, you wipe out the templars, and after everything that went down, topped by what Anders did, you will only get the people against you, seems logical that more and more templars from other lands will come to end the situation and mages everywhere will suffer more from this act; not to mention all the abominations that run free.

Every strategy I've read on that battle, urges either a battlemage or some kind of mage tank.  They always spoke ill of rogues.  And how do I march into battle?  As a damn rogue.


My golem was the first to fall, but the Harvester was weakened enough to begin the second phase of the battle; I accidentally inflicted friendly fire when I used Dworkin's explosives (carried over from my character's misadventures during the Awakening expansion), which knocked out my dwarven allies.  (At this point, I figure it's futile to struggle, but something tells me to see if I can't turn the tide.  I humor this seemingly foolhardy thought.)  So, it's me, a group a skeletons, and the Harvester, all running after me (with Harvey in its lesser form).  I dropped what grenades I had, spammed regular health poultices, and spammed the ""Strength of Stone"" mode (earned via the Legionnaire Scout specialization).  I gulped down stamina vials (I forget the correct name of the item) and unloaded that one attack that enables a constant flurry of strokes, each of which draining from your stamina reserve.  (Again, with the names and the forgetting; at the end of my day.)


Finally, it's down me the Harvester which seemed to only want to jump around one area away from me, and the one boss-level skeleton that was in ""red mode,"" stronger than me by a few points, harder to hit, and constantly snapping at my heels as I try to evade him.  Seeing a moment to turn the tide, I attacked this ""harvested skeleton"" and eat away at his health bar.  Five minutes and 20+ standard health poultices later, I could then finally devote all of my attention on Harvey.  And I did.  He was caught in a loop of leaping around the room in the same pattern for a few minutes.  I attacked him with one or two swings as he approaches me, and repeat until he has a sliver of life left.  He suddenly abandoned that pattern, and rushed into my sword.  As if to end this dance in acceptance of his fate.

That trophy award sound made my evening.  If you read up to this point, thanks for taking the time.  Now, I can move on to DA2... (except, there's the one trophy left in that Darkspawn Chronicles DLC that doesn't count toward the platinum, apparently.  Time enough for another day.)"	t5_2r8lo	True

Everyone in the game has distinct goals, however.  One wants to slay a dragon, another wants to free their family from slavery, two are mages searching for objects of power.

- **Mindless trash mobs**. Dungeon Keeper implemented fear for trash mobs ages ago. Even SWTOR many times make people non-hostile when you beat them. They have no excuse. You don't get to present yourself as a story-based game studios if you make the protagonist kill fifteen citizens because of an argument (Before you find Anders, a group of Fereldans try to stop you. So you just kill them all. They all fight until their last breath. You suffer no consequences). DA2 is supposed to be about the rise to power of a citizen living in a politically complex situation. You can't say your story tries to approach city life if you allow the protagonist to kill hundreds of people over the years with no consequence. That's why orcs, goblins and darkspawn exist in the first place: what works for mindless beasts doesn't work for humans. Every human death outside of warzones has to mean something.

- **Loot**. It works for nobodies like the Lone Wanderer or the Spirit Monk. It doesn't work for Commander Shepard or for the Inquisitor, who have large, wealthy organizations backing them up. Buying your own thing is ok. Looting an assassin you just defended yourself from to look for clues is ok. Looting people as a general mechanism for trash like a cabbage and 2 copper coins isn't.

- **Isabela's tits**. Or anyone's for that matter outside of intimate scenes. I don't care if David Gaider says it's ""her personality"" (which is bull anyway - it's the personality the art dude, Shane Whathisname, decided to bestow upon her. She's a character from a videogame. The people who write and draw her decide those things—not ""her"". Don't even start with the ""it's her choice"" bullshit). I'm wearing shorts and flip flops right now. Doesn't mean I would wear that if my friend the Inquisitor asked if I could help killing demons. What's this, a fashion magazine? Design adequate gear that fits her personality instead. **EDIT:** Look at [the concept art in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1iwdlq/matt_rhodes_dragon_age_and_mass_effect_concept/).

The problem is following tradition is easier. Programmers know how to program combat, loot etc. Classic RPG stuff. Writers know how to pace scenes with filler combat in-between. Everyone is used to killing trash as simply the thing the player does between conversations. If combat has to make sense storywise, you have to come up with something else for the player to do.

I picked up where I left off and went right ahead into the Circle, eventually I got to the Fade. Since I don't like that part of the game very much, I had the ""Skip the Fade"" mod installed since some time back to not have to endure the hours it takes to get though all those puzzles.

The thing is that I brought Ser Gilmore with me into the fade, with ""Skip the Fade"" loaded, and what I did not know was that those two have a tendency to conflict, so now I'm stuck in Leliana's Nightmare, I can't use the Fade Pedestal( nothing happens when I interact with it), my autosaves only reach as far back as to Morrigan's Nightmare which in my case is right before that, it doesn't work simply unloading Rory and/or Skip the Fade, as that only allows me to get to the first ""room"" of the Fade where you meet Niall, and I can not use the console to teleport myself anywhere since the console does not work at all for me.

I am completely clueless as to what I should do, I have no idea how to untangle myself out of this situation. So if anyone has any idea at all as to what I can do, that'd be greatly appreciated. Below I'll provide a list of all the mods I have loaded that I know of, in case it is in fact not a conflict between ""Ser Gilmore"" and ""Skip the Fade"" but between other mods.

But now that I'm in Awakening, I feel like my mage is just goddamn untouchable! With Draining Aura I can just invest a ton in deepening my mana pool and bosses can never really hurt me all that much, and things like Hand of Winter and Repulsion Field make large numbers of weak enemies total jokes. I think the only time I've died so far was when I tried to take down the lightning-dragon in the Blackmarsh. I actually don't even bother trying to heal my party since they just get in the way of all my awesome AoE spells. 

Has this been everyone else's experience? How about with other classes, does Awakening's faster leveling just make everyone's life easier? Should I try ramping up the difficulty?

1320424304.0	m0fi3	Reconciling Roleplaying wants with Min/Maxing needs on Nightmare Mode	sage_of_majic	10	1	17	"Hi everyone, I recently got back into Dragon Age: Origins after playing DA2 and am having some difficulties creating my character. Let me preface by saying that the most important part of the game for me is roleplaying and my favourite character archetype to play is the wise wizard. When I played Neverwinter I made an intelligent, wise, well spoken but psychically frail Wizard/Cleric and I'd like to do something similar in Dragon Age. The problem arises when choosing where to place attributes. Ideally, I'd like to have a mage with maxed out cunning but the only character who would do that would be a rouge. I don't just want my character to be smart I want him to be wise and interested in the mysteries of magic and the fade. Normally I would just gimp my character but I want to challenge myself on nightmare mode so my questions are thus: How much cunning do I need to unlock all the hidden dialogue options? Would a healing mage keeping cunning, magic and willpower at a 1:1:1 ratio be viable in nightmare mode?

edit: Also, I imagine I'll want to do the same thing in Dragon Age 2 so if I could get the answers for both games that would be extra helpful

Story: While 2 has a more complex and paralleled story, i prefer Origins. Origins had choices change the world, as well as it being simple, but ultimately engaged.
Pacing: 2 fails at this with immense flair. the first 12 hours are grinding for damn money so you can go on a quest so you can GET ON WITH THE STORY.
Characters: i never got Wynne or Lelianne. ever. i had Morrigan, Alistair, Zevran, Sten, and the dog. a dysfunctional party that suited my every need. and i liked them all. 2 had Varric, Fenris, and Merril. i liked only those three. anders is a shitlock and Aveline was never engaging. and carver was annoying as well.
Combat: now we have the meat of both games. 2 is faster, origins is much more flexible. all through 2 i was forced to wield a staff and wear a robe, until i got the champion's armor. But the combat simply pleased me more. Origins was a bit more muddled, but i loved my tank-mage that could wield spellweaver and wore heavy armor.

I have finished DA twice. I have fought :
1. The Archdemon in Denerim
2. The High Dragon during the quest for the Ashes.
3. Flemeth at the request of Morrigan.
4. Arcane Horror
5. Revenant
etc etc.
But out of all these foes nobody has kicked my ass, no wait, my entire party's ass like Ser Cauthrien. I manage to kill her entire entourage, only to be killed by her. Force Field doesn't hold her for long, Cone of Cold is resisted most of the time, when it does work, it freezes her for a couple of seconds at best. She resists Horror, Waking Nightmare stuns her for a second or two. I hit her with everything but still end up dead with the rest of my party.

I'm not at home right now to check but I think in the party selection I only saw slots for 3 chars in the party.

I haven't played Dragon Age in a while, but just found this subreddit, and thought I'd share with you (what I think is) a very interesting build I did for my Awakening playthrough.

I can't remember the specifics, but I noticed that the rogue was very poorly built as a class.  It seemed to rely on the backstab mechanic to deal a lot of critical damage, but its two weapon trees (and combat in DA:O is very reliant on weapon trees), Two-weapon Fighting and Archery both cannot use backstab at all (or at least you can't while using dual striking, which seemed to be a talent one would always want on).

So I decided to forgo both of the weapon trees and focus only on the non-weapon talent trees, and it was sort of awesome.  I could stun easily, and use my allies to hold enemies in place so I could backstab and do huge piles of critical damage.  

In the end, I discovered you had enough talent points to *just* fill all of the Rogue trees, including Heartseeker.  I picked the Assassin, Duelist, Shadow, and maybe legionnaire scout (I can't remember how many specialization points you get), all of which gave me great active and passive abilities.

I was able to use a shield with the Legion of the Dead Heraldry, pick some badass light armor (I could even use heavy armor if I wanted; I had enough strength), and I believe Vigilance.

I know I could have picked a fighter, but this seemed (and was) much more fun than playing a straight shield-fighter.

As for controls, I am having issues coming from the ease of use that is the 360 controller to the cumbersome keyboard. I know I know, don't have a heart attack now. Yes I can do more with the keyboard. My issue comes in where I am not a fan of having to click on an enemy or item to attack or pick it up. On the 360, you just had to look in the general direction, the item or enemy name you wanted to interact with had to have a health bar or name pop up and all you had to do was press the action button. Much less time consuming than having to position my cursor over the object. I know it's probably something I have to get used to and will come to be comfortable with. I guess my problems more with the mouse than the keyboard. I'm fine with the movement, I just can't get used to lining up perfectly Everytime to issue an action. 

My second issue I hold with contempt, having to press tab to see where books and such are. On the 360, these items are glowing just like any pile of loot. Is there a mod to make the pc do the same? 

Yes I have seen the mod for the auto loot. I have also heard it has issues but that was in a 900 day old post. Are these issues worked out? How easy is auto-loot to use? Is there a console command that loots the area you are in? 

Character Respec. I have seen this but I was curious how it works. Does it allow you to redistribute attribute and talent points? Is there a console command that does this for you? 

I already have the Skip the Fade mod installed. 

What tips can you give me with the PC version? Anything would help. Thank you "	t5_2r8lo	True

Are his plans actually plausible? If they could come to fruition, would it be something that would be morally justified? Obviously this is a leading question and will be more based on personal beliefs than a pure ""right"" answer. 

I find it hard to get behind the Architect myself. I recognize that it may be the only way for peaceful cohabitation with the Darkspawn, but it seems to come at the cost not only of many lives, but deep cultural losses as well.

I get inside the tower and near instantly get mowed down by all the archers and mage in the room.  And there in lies my problem with the game.  The inability for my party to stay alive.  Regardless of how I micromanage them, or let them run free, or setup combat tactics.  Everyone just gets destroyed.

So it's unbelievably frustrating to fight the same fight 4 or 5 times, for every fight.  I can understand a boss fight taking a few tries to get the tactics right... but every fight!?  Just starts to feel like it's all random and you just have to hope for the numbers of hits to roll in your favor.

I'm playing a mage. I didn't want to be the classic Evocation Pew Pew mage.  But rather do stuff like Entropy with the fun Drain Life, Horror spells and eventually spec Blood Mage.  But it seems like the game would rather push me to using Fire Balls and Healing spells. Maybe I should have named my character Fizban and had at it. Bleh.

**tl:dr;** My party always dies quickly on every fight, no matter how much I micromanage.

Edit:  Took everyone's advice.  Loaded everyone down with tactics to drink Pots when their health was low and really started focusing on choosing my cohorts actions for them, rather than letting the AI.  The game has gotten loads more fun and now I can actually move through the story at a much better pace, and now seeing how awesome it is.  The ogre fight at the top of the tower was amazing.

1376079729.0	1k1qrx	"They're called ""Qunari"""	IX_Hispana	19	11	24	"You can call this my attempt at becoming the king of the nerds.

I've heard a few times people refer to the race of ox-men who invaded Kirkwall ""Kossith"", most recently in the ""what race are you going to play?"" thread. The idea is that Qunari is only the religion and ""Kossith"" is the name of the species. Here's why it's a bad idea.

Qunari is a bit like ""Elven"". When you ask the Dalish guarding their camp who they are, they say they're ""the last of the Elven"". You point out you've seen lots of other elves in the city. She replies that those have given up their identity to live among shemlen, so they're ""Elven"" no more. It's a cultural identity firmly tied to a species.

Likewise, the oxmen are Qunari. (Only difference is they accept every species into the Qun, whereas """"Elven"" is elf-exclusive). Qunari that are not followers of the Qun are exactly that: Qunari that don't follow the Qun, just like we have atheist Jews here on planet Earth. Simple as that. As for Qunari from other species, we can specify that if we want to avoid confusion. Qunari elf, Qunari human. When we say ""Qunari"" in general, it is a safe bet to think that we're talking about their species. And we can always tell one meaning from the other from the context. For example, [here is Sten comparing the strength of human teeth and Qunari teeth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UB8Og8ZzuA#t=24m50s). That shows the term Qunari is also used to refer to them, not only to their beliefs.

What is ""Kossith"" then? Honestly, I have no idea. I have never heard the word in the game, never read a codex entry that included it. Qunari definitely don't call themselves that (they call themselves Qunari), nor do the denizens of Ferelden and the Free Marches (who call them Qunari).

1364234378.0	1azi1i	A few questions about Dragon Age 2 (no spoilers please!)	ordeath	11	5	6	"Hi guys,

I picked up and installed DA2 a while ago, played for a few hours and then kind of forgot about it.  Mainly because I kept hearing about how it wasn't nearly as good as DA:O, which I love to bits. But I just decided to play it anyway, especially since many people were also slamming Mass Effect 2 and I ended up loving it nearly as much as ME1.

So I just restarted DA2 and feel a little lost.  I'm worried about Googling for answers and getting spoilers so I thought I'd ask here.

**Side Quests and Secondary Quests**

There are about a gajillion ""side quests"", ""secondary quests"" ""premium quests"" etc showing up on my Journal.  What I want to know is, are any of these critical for the main story? I know by definition a ""side quest"" usually isn't, but what about secondary quests?  I kind of want to make sure all the companions are recruited and their stories fleshed out, and to complete the main story as thoroughly as possible. I don't want to get bogged down in too many fetch/kill errands if the only payoff will be loot or XP. But having been burned a few times in Mass Effect by either not getting to a quest on time or ignoring a seemingly minor request (Wrex's family armor...), I don't want to have that experience ever again.

**Conversation Wheel Options**

It appears that Hawke's responses are similar to Mass Effect's Paragon-Neutral-Renegade options, with little icons that tell you which is which--very helpful! What I want to know is, can I mix and match responses without negative repercussions? Or do I have to max out one or the other? Of course with companions I know I should try to have a consistent relationship (if for no other reason than to unlock special skills), but with NPCs I would really like to role-play more naturally, responding as appropriate to victims and villains. But would this affects Hawke's main story arc, or makes a particular ending difficult to achieve?

**Selling Loot**

I know I must be overlooking the obvious, but where are the merchants I can sell all my junk to? The ones in town just talk when I right click on them."	t5_2r8lo	True

I consider it my favourite game and now I'm thinking about dipping into my savings and buying the Ultimate Edition from Steam as an early birthday present to cheer myself up.

But before I do that I just wanted to ask about some of the system requirements. My PC is pretty crappy but it can run the game on low to medium settings (which I'm OK with, I love the story) but the problem is that I'm low on space on my Hard Drive.

I have a 500Gb HDD with 3 partitions - C (50Gb), D, and E - I have 56Gb free on E (the partition where my Steam folder is), but my C partition only has 2.5Gb to spare (possibly part of the reason my PC is slow). I've heard that the game creates C:\Users\User\Documents\BioWare and that it stores quite a bit in there (didn't really pay attention when I had it installed and I didn't have the DLCs).

So I'm asking for some help, could you check how large the BioWare folder is (if you have the game installed at the moment) and let me know. Also, on a totally unrelated note, is there some way to rearrange HDD partitions without formatting and reinstalling Windows?

Thanks in advance for your help."	t5_2r8lo	True

I've done this about 10 times and picked all the positive (joking/heart) options and I still cannot get her in a relationship. I have also investigated and gone through all of those scripts to no avail.

The forums are unhelpful. All I can find are things about people just talking about the fooling around scene (which I can get to). The wiki just says she can be romanced (the love way), but whenever I try, it just won't work.

I'm on my second play-through of DA2, this time as a mage, and I'm having a much easier time on Hard with a mage than I did on Normal-Hard as a Rogue.  I'm a Force Mage / Blood Mage combination, and I'm currently running with Fenris, Isabela, and Anders.  I just finished an area full of lyrium smugglers and it went beautifully.  Anders and I stood back, working from a distance, while Fenris and Isabela were in the thick of things.  I would set down a Gravitic Ring where enemies were running towards, then Pull of the Abyss when they were slowed down and stuck there, so that they fell on their butts.  Then a quick Fist of the Maker on the cluster of them, followed by a Chain Lightning.  Then I started picking out the foremen among them, using Crushing Prison and Hex of Torment.  Someone had broken free of the crowd by then and was running toward me.  I used Horror on him right when Anders used a Glyph of Paralysis on him, so he was frozen in front of me for me to pick off with basic attacks.

My boyfriend's behind me, swearing at his PC over a Starcraft II match, while I'm gleefully cackling about destroying enemies right and left.  I think my favorite role has been this glass cannon mage, for crowd control.  That has been easier and more rewarding than picking off individual enemies as a rogue in my previous play-through.  The varterral battle was downright easy as a Force Mage because the bastard never got a chance to move; he was slow and stuck in one spot for almost the whole battle, because of my spells.

1257447425.0	a1cou	PlayStation 3 Dragon Age: Origin Impressions	threepio	14	6	6	"I managed to score a copy of the collector's edition for PS3 yesterday. I'll be picking it up on Steam as well, but I do enjoy Achievements/Trophies and I wanted a big screen / 5.1 surround sound experience for my first playthrough.



**Out of the Box: Collector's Edition**

For an extra $10 I'm surprised that anyone is buying the standard edition; the collector's edition delivers for me. The packaging is quite attractive. 

For the PS3 it still sports the old PlayStation logo - a bit odd considering the brand revamp happened almost two months ago. The slip case is attractive, and the metal tin looks great with the screened art. Everything's packed quite tightly inside - manual, cloth map, two discs, and two pieces of paper for the included bonus content.

I was very impressed with the manual; it doesn't compare to Baldur's Gate I or II (I still have those on my bookshelf and leaf through them from time to time. Volo and Elminster crack me up) but it's got a sufficient quantity of information to get you started. The cloth map is an ever so *slight* disappointment: it's shedding threads on my coffee table as we speak. I was hoping the edges would be finished; I'm going to have to either frame this or fold it up and not handle it or it'll be gone before you know it.

The DLC on PS3 is a chore. Downloading each piece of content boots you out of the game into the PlayStation Store Lite Edition that will only let you download that piece of content. You have to go through the process of downloading the item, waiting for it to install, then popping back into the game to choose the next piece. It's a right pain in the ass when you've got half a dozen chunks of content from the CE, Dragon Age Journeys, and the Character Creator. Checking under Dragon Age in the PS Store yields no available content - something that would have made it easy to download the items you have rights too. I suppose they have to verify your EA account, but it's still restrictive and a right pain in the ass. It felt like the game was trying my patience when I was getting set up.

I did buy the optional content for $7. We usually pay more for these items in Canada, so I took the opportunity while it was $7. Downloaded and installed in the same process, took about five minutes.


**Gameplay So Far**

I can't really do much here other than chime in with everyone else: it's great. Like really, really good. This is a statement made amongst some really fantastic PS3 gaming (Uncharted 2, Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time, Borderlands). It delivers the goods.



**Video Performance**

It's true that the frame rate becomes janky at times. You just feel like you're moving a little slowly. That said, I'm bringing up the radial menu so often that it's not something I'm overly concerned with. I don't miss the overhead view as much as I thought I would. I'm sure I'll enjoy it on PC, but I love being in the thick of the action on my 42"" plasma at the moment.

It has to be said that the colours and the textures are fantastic. I went with the PS3 version after reading several reviews that said the Xbox version felt washed out and the low res textures on it were bothering reviewers. I can't speak to the Xbox version, but the PS3 version looks wonderful. I'm so pleased with the whole host of colours other than brown and grey - there are roaring rich fires that glint off of armor, deep red blood, ominous greens and blues. In short: Dragon Age: Origins does away with the next gen filter and gives the colour gamut of your HDTV a workout.

There are some glitches and tearing, but they're few in number and brief in duration.


**Audio**

If you're looking for immersive audio, DA:O has it. Music is subtle, sounds are realistic, and the 5.1 surround is always active. I chose a bit of a smarmy character voice (I'm rolling a bard first time around) so I'm hearing things like ""Because we're that AWESOME!"" or something similar - it's a bit odd but I'm going with it. 

I had to turn the sound down later in the evening for fear of irritating my neighbors. Let's just say that the bass is very, very present.


**Social Networking and Enhanced Content**

DA:O did something quite different when it has come to marketing. Setting up a sub-reddit on reddit was a smart, fun movie - giving gamers an uncensored place to speak frankly about the game. The Bioware Social network is another interesting move - instead of turning responsibility over to a third party, Bioware has decided to own that piece of the pie (and take responsibility, to a degree, for what happens there).

Finally, Dragon Age Journeys was a master-stroke; a 2D adventure to get gamers prepped for the 3D experience - and one that fleshes out the backstory of the game and offers bonuses for the 3D version. It's clear that EA/Bioware are looking to build a brand and a franchise out of Dragon Age - and that's something that I have no problem with, given the smart interconnections that they've managed to create.


**Conclusions thus far**

I can feel really good about recommending this game. With a pedigree that hails two of my favourite games of all times at its root, I had high hopes for DA:O. So far it has delivered everything it promised and then some. With six separate storylines I can see this as a game that some gamers (myself included) will lose themselves in for months (and perhaps years) to come."	t5_2r8lo	True

I love this game so much but feel that I won't be able to make it through another playthrough without getting bored, although I really would like to. 

Are there any mods you can suggest that would mix up the playthrough or things I can do to bring some variation into the way I play the game? (Only mods I am using is Character Respecialisation and 2 bug fixing mods)

Does this mean we're gonna see DA2 style combat, even though they've said that it will be more tactical?

Or are they in a sort of a middle ground, where the combat will go fast, yet pausing and thinking it through will be essential?

If I had to choose a combat style, it'll be Origins. Though the DA2 was fun to play as well. What do you guys think?"	t5_2r8lo	True

1369618350.0	1f41y9	First playthrough build help?	justmerriwether	13	5	19	"So this is my first playthrough (although my second stab at getting into this game) and I decided to play an elf warrior, which I know is not necessarily the ideal race/class match up, but I love elves and I assumed that warrior would be an easier class for my first playthrough.

I'm about ten hours in now, just got to the circle tower to get help saving the Arl's son/abomination. 

I've been finding that I'm doing less damage, dying faster, and just generally not performing nearly as well as my party members, despite the fact that Alistair, The closest comparison, has lower strength and lower constitution. We're both sword and shield style (I haven't messed around much with their leveling up and left it to auto). He's been wearing the same splintmail since the beginning, whereas I've moved up to heavy chainmail. My fatigue is 10%, his is like 3.

Any help in guiding my build would be appreciated. I normally like to just play through the first time on my own, but the fact that my ai team keeps outperforming me is really dampening my enjoyment. Alistair even snagged that first epic ogre execution in ostagar because I'd been killed moments earlier.

If I left out anything that might help you give me better advice (I'm sure I have) just ask

The focused characters were awesome. So does Dragon Age 2 share this pattern??

Apparently I'm supposed to see some sort of a campaign selection in the main menu, but there isn't one. 
Is there ANY way I can play this thing without buying the digital download of Awakening ? if there isn't, is Awakening worth paying $40 for the digital version rather the $9 I spent on the used disc ?
