I recently realized I had gotten quite a [collection](http://s3.amazonaws.com/images.couchsurfing.us/AJHTVMF/16283693_l_f9f4061c7551fa715261bfedd4eab769.jpg) (they're almost all of Portuguese places, plus Paris and London on the right). So.. I was wondering if anyone would like to help me with this and send me a touristic map of where they're from. Transportation (train/bus/metro routes) maps would also be great. Thanks a lot, and if there's anything from Lisboa (Portugal) you'd want (not our touristic map though, it's pretty fugly) ask ahead!	t5_2qiwh	True

Xpost from r/AskHistorians"	irishGOP413	12	1	15	I guess I'm just curious if there is anyone that works to make accurate and detailed historical models of cities or even geographical regions. By models, I mean 3-D computer models that take into account topography, historical period, and architecture to create a vivid landscape. I mean, with the archeological and architectural data we have for older sites (i.e. Ancient Rome), and pictures, scale drawings, and old maps we have for more recent sites and times (i.e. Detroit), is this possible? Is anyone working on it? Is there some sort of database for such materials? I just feel that if we were able to get a feel for these historical periods, they might be easier and more interesting for young students of history to learn about.	t5_2qiwh	True

There's GIS software, but that I don't know where to even begin with that.

The specific project I have in mind is the growth/fall of populations of the American midwest over the past 40ish years.

1319577465.0	lovpm	Not sure what this would be called.. but trying to find a map of countries where the countries are written in their native name	jesusisthe1lol	13	3	9	"I have been google'n for days, but I can't seem to find this type of map that I'm looking for. My girlfriend has said that she has seen a nice printed one before and liked it. I would like to find one for her birthday..

As described in my title, it's a map of countries where the countries are written in their native name.
The closest that I have found is [this map](http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-maps/image/world-political-native-name.jpg), but that's not quite right... For example, Argentina would be written as ""República Argentina""

Has anyone come across a map like this? Does anyone have any suggestions for a better way to search for this?

Thank you!"	t5_2qiwh	True

Here's a [great video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1GyZbvnRMU).

What I don't understand is how Indianola is treated on Google maps. Look [here.](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=indianola,+Tx&amp;ll=28.515159,-96.507039&amp;spn=0.013726,0.028174&amp;client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hnear=Indianola,+Calhoun,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=16)

See all the streets and lots?

Now look at the [satellite view.](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=indianola,+Tx&amp;ll=28.515159,-96.507039&amp;spn=0.013726,0.028174&amp;client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hnear=Indianola,+Calhoun,+Texas&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=16)

How and why would Google maps incorporate the layout of the disappeared town—especially one that would not be on any modern map that would be used as a source?

I used a mind-mapping program called ""[TheBrain](http://www.thebrain.com/)"" to connect all the dots and wikipedia for basic connections between genres. If you're curious, [here's a preview](http://imgur.com/a/Bh7To) of what the map looks like in TheBrain.

There are a lot of inaccuracies, I'm sure, but that's one reason I want to share the files!

I understand that in the case of French Guiana and other overseas territories of France, there is a some sort of autonomy.

Yet unlike American states, which are always shown as a single country (including Alaska and Hawaii), French Guiana consistently shows as a separate entity from France in topical maps.

Hello, as my title suggests I am looking for maps of Japan and Tokyo ranging from 1947-1965. I am working on my Masters' in history, specifically Post-war Japanese detective fiction, and these maps would be very helpful to establish the scope, both broad and intimate, of the action which takes place. Note, original Japanese maps or English language are perfectly fine. An added bonus would be maps from each of the relevant periods (the late, post-war 1940's, the 1950's, and the early 1960's). Any help would be greatly appreciated, or if there is a more applicable sub-reddit to request such aid that would also be appreciated.

An in advance thank you to anyone who takes the time to check this out, or pass it on to someone they think may be interested or able to help. 

Be awesome,

He was a completely broke college student at the time and he couldn't afford it, and he never saw it again. I've been hearing about it for years, and what he remembered for certain was that it was an equal-area projection, sponsored by the OAS (it might have been the UN) and it had, along the border and in the empty spaces, old projections according to who was in power at that point in history.

Now, I'm fairly certain it was a Gall-Peters projection, but I can't find a map that also has that historical side to it. I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit knows what map I'm talking about or knows of one that is similar. Thanks to everyone in advance!

I really like maps and associate memories of places I've been with the respective maps. I would like to put some maps of regions important to me on my wall(s). Obviously there aren't printed maps available for all regions I have in mind and not in the quality I would like them.  
Do you know of a way to achieve that goal? I know one can stitch together maps from google maps segments, but I would like to define which ""layers"" to show like in Google Earth. There is also the problem with maps from Google not really being printer friendly as I only can obtain pixel images but would prefer vector formats to get sharper results.  
I kind of expect that what I want isn't possible at the moment.  
I just found [MapOSMatic](http://maposmatic.org/) (via [OSM on Paper](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_on_Paper)).

My original plan was to assign each plot a value in a grid, A1, A2, A3…  B1, B2… etc. Now I realize that even if I have bended rows that snake around somewhat, doing this is still close to impossible. The drawing I included is just a fake example, but it shows that some areas are simply too scattered. My next plan was to get a length of rope and break the cemetery up into quadrants or blocks, but I am not experienced with doing this. 


As you can see, some of the cemetery can easily be categorized using a column and row system, other areas not so much. I have no topographic or aerial view and limited equipment. I generally could use experienced advice and a better approach to how I am going to do this. Any other advice on software etc would be greatly appreciated. I know a lot of people on reddit are good with this type of problem solving.

I'm not a super great map-maker, and the process I'd used to create the original map array was pretty messy, so I figured I could write a map generator which could do the job for (and better than) me. For my purposes, it turned out pretty good. It forges a 3D-based terrain through up to 20 levels and produces either a text array or a color topographical map. A friend commented that it was pretty cool and maybe others would benefit from it, so I polished it up a little bit. I wrote it all in raw JavaScript while commuting back and forth to work on the ferry boat. It's not perfect, but I hope someone finds some use for it.

I'm looking for a map of raised sea levels in ~2080-2100 that shows modern political boundaries, ideally without country names. Everything I find is either very local or regional or is a purely topographical map.

Perfect case would be just white for land and blue for sea, with toggleable current borders and country names (or two maps- one with and one without)

(My personal reason for choosing that program for my thesis is because I know how to use it, but that's not very scientific ;)


*Edit: c&amp;p my comment below to give a better impression of what I'm looking for:*

I'm looking specifically at its application in mapping and, to a lesser extent, how it compares to other raster software. Also who uses it (amateur cartographers, journalists, scientists from other fields, professional cartographers?) and for what; and what would be an incentive to use PS instead of specialised software -- I think a lot of people use it because it's so well known and there are a lot of tutorials for it online; it might also be more easily available than specialised programs. But I have to back these claims up. So far I've found that it is used almost universally for finishing touches, but without the Geographic Imager plug-in it's missing some important functionalities like georeferencing support, geographical metadata and reprojection capabilities.

Obviously, that's a big hindrance to economic integration; conversely, one might expect unusually deep economic integration between places that are far apart but where shipping is easier. 

Are there any maps that convey this? I'm thinking you could make a cool one that converts cost to distance so, for example, most major seaports are located quite close to each other, while inaccessible inland areas are extremely far away. Alternatively, one could specify ""iso-shipping-cost"" lines that show, centered on a given location, points that cost the same amount to ship to. For the earlier example of certain African countries, from an African port they'd share an isocost line with China."	t5_2qiwh	True

To that end I'm looking for maps that show portions of Eurasia - especially maps that go into Persia and India. Stuff like these.

I feel the need to inform you that I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for what I am going to ask you, but it is the closest thing I found.

So, here it goes. I am writing a book, and I would very much need a proper place to create my story. In other words, I need the setting. In my mind, it would be best if it were somewhere in the UK, but anywhere with the appropriate description of the place would be good.

I need it to be somewhere at the seaside. The action takes place in a really small village, which is linked to major city. Also, although I do not think it can be ""located"" on a map, I would need a lighthouse, that would guide over the village. And near the lighthouse, there should be an abandoned house. Or whatever, a house that lies alone from the village.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/yu7gd.jpg) is a picture of how it would look the best. I do apologise in advance for my crappy drawing, I have never been talented in that domain. But this is the best I could come up with.

My question states as followed: is there a *real existing* place out there in the world, so that I can use that location as my setting, or not and I should just create the place?

I want to thank you for the time you've taken to read this post, and hopefully for the time that you were willing to give to find such a place. Thank you once again!"	t5_2qiwh	True

I've been looking for something that is compatible with my MacBook but with no luck (its a few years old, and running OSX 10.6.8).  The shortcoming I have is that I don't have the time (or wherewithal) to create maps from scratch.  I need to overlay them on an existing world map; preferably with cities/town/rivers/etc already on it.

I've been editing my own in google maps but I don't really like the UI.  The thing is I want to create regional maps that also include sub-regions and detailed info about them.  If you put too many shapes/markers into google maps it splits them up into multiple pages and makes the resulting maps difficult to read.  It would be fine if you could custom control what goes on what page, but it does not give you that ability. It is also pretty slow when creating “shapes” when you have (what it considers) too many points in a ""shape"".

I've tried [""Ortelius""](https://www.mapdiva.com/) and it does not seem to fit my purposes (IMO).  I’ve also looked into [imapbuilder](www.imapbuilder.com).  It actually looks pretty good for my purposes, but it is friggin expensive!  I can’t use the regular software because it is only for windows, and the Gmap editor (which I like) is $529!  The monthly options are pretty ridiculous.

I also cross posted in /r/wine.

Could any owners of these atlases (or any other of course!), tell me what they like and don't like? What the style of the maps is? Do they look modern, or more traditional style? How legible are the maps, and is the detail to your liking? That sort of thing.

I plan on buying the [print version of the CIA factbook](http://www.amazon.com/CIA-World-Factbook-2013/dp/1616088230/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348797805&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=cia+world+factbook+2013) to augment my atlas experience."	t5_2qiwh	True

CozyHeartPenguin	2	0	3	"I like to collect old original maps and I've decided I need to start cataloging them all on the internet, maybe create a blog or at least have digital copies if my home burns down. Either way, I have a few maps which I won't be able to just pass through a scanner with ease and I have two major issues to solve:

The worst problem is a 1920's Oil Field Map of Signal Hill/Long Beach, CA. The map is about 2'x6' and it is mounted on a piece of 1"" foam core. The only two options I can think of for creating a digital version are taking pictures or using a handheld scanner. Both seem like they might lose some of the quality and there would be a lot of edge matching to create one seamless image.

I also have a 1940's map book with about 60 maps all over Southern California. It is in amazing condition and I do not like the idea of folding over the pages to press it into a typical flat bed scanner. I know there are V-shaped scanners for books, but I have never seen one that can handle 11x17 books, nor do I know where to find someone who offers that service.

I was hoping the community might have a few other options that would result in high quality scans without too much work. Thanks!"	t5_2qiwh	True
