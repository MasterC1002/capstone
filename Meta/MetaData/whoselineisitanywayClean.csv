*Get. The fuck. Over it.*

""Wah Drew was so perfect! How could they do this without Drew?!""

Because it's TV and that's how shit works. And people bitched about Drew when he started hosting because he was a fat, annoying American.

""Those 90210 ads sucked! I'm worried about the quality of the show based solely on them!""

Ads are terrible by nature. These would be no different. And if I was doing a televised improv show I wouldn't put the good bits that make it into the show on ads either. Save the good stuff for air.

""Aisha sucks! She's on the talk and has a vagina and is not Drew!""

She's Lana on Archer and therefore gets a comedic pass on anything she ever does, but I'll still defend her. She's funny. Listen to the ""You Made it Weird"" episode with her on it. She's gonna fit right in with this group. She auditioned and got the role for a reason.

""I hope _____ comes back or I'm killing myself in protest!""

Slow down, Speedy. 10 episodes have been picked up for this trial run. I've seen at least 67 names thrown around for the above comment and I don't think the math adds up. Something about a missing decimal. Anyway, it all boils down to one thing...

Get over it, watch it, love/hate it, continue/stop watching the new episodes, and be happy we've been given a chance to see improv at this level on TV again.

1374633945.0	1ixi83	Something is off with the new Whose line.	Neon_42	150	38	116	"I think we've all noticed that there is something off with the new Whose line. 3 episodes in and its very much not the same show. Not that we'd expect the exact same show back, but that the new version could be better. I'd like this to be a discussion on things that are not going well and things we think they could do better. 

Here is my list of things that I've found particularly off about the show in no particular order:

1) The guest stars
    - maybe its just me but I really hate the guest stars already. It is nice every once in a while but 3 episodes in a row it kinda grinds on me. Not to mention it doesn't feel very spontaneous. If they know that a guest star is coming they can prepare in some way. I'm sure it is possible to keep it a secret, and they might keep it from the performers, but never the less it doesn't feel like improv if it happens every episode. 

2) Hashtags
    - The hashtags don't add anything to the show. I personally find them a bit of a distraction and a poor production choice, but I guess they are easy enough to ignore. 
 
3) Run time
    - I've looked into the run times of the new episodes and the old ones. The new episodes run for about 20:00 minutes where the old ones run for about 22:00 minutes maybe a bit less. I think this slows down the time between games which really helps. If there is a pause with a bit of banter between performers and hosts it makes transitions a lot smoother between games. It also allows for some tension to build before the punch lines.  

4) Host interaction
    - I like Aisha Tyler but she doesn't interact very much with the performers like Drew did. One of the best parts of the old US version was the repertoire between the host and the performers. This isn't necessarily Aisha's fault.  I'm willing to let this one sit as it might take time for these folks to get comfortable with each other.  I have taken notice and will be watching for improvement. 

5) Winners
    - For the love of god pick a winner at the end. I don't like how everybody wins and we all have a good time and sing songs just like in primary school. I liked the randomness of this from the older show and I'd like them to bring it back. Waiting through a commercial  to come back with the guest and read the credits makes me feel like I've been cheated. Pick a winner and do a game with the host. In addition if they could do without the commercial before the credits that would be great. I feel that was an annoyance in the older version too. 


A few of these things are going to have to change or they will probably lose my viewership. 

What are your thoughts and feelings?

I think the weaknesses are structural, like they're making her overexplain the show and the games. The space used for hashtags would be better used for reminders of what each character is supposed to be doing, like it was in the old days.

And she'd have more time for repartee/interaction if she didn't have to keep introducing guest stars. Or if she was able to go into the audience and bring people down.

My only quibble is she should adopt Drew's ""the points are like..."" because it's such a familiar and easy joke.

So I decided to put a stopwatch on the new episodes, because it seemed like it was all talk from Aisha and commercials.  What I wanted to time was the real time that they were doing a skit.  I've included in this the guessing after 'Let's Make a Date,' but not the set-up to the game or the banter after a scene.  And just because the time was so low, I decided to include them reading the credits.

New first episode, total time that the performers were doing a skit: 12 minutes, 42 seconds.

Finding an older episode was a whole lot harder since of course they killed all of the old episodes, never mind that's why they were able to revive it.  But I managed to find the Robin Williams episode and timed it in the same way.  This was not because I was looking for that one, but simply because it was a complete episode that I managed to find.  

That time: 16 minutes, 23 seconds.

I should also note that the new episode's total run time was only half a minute shorter.  So, yeah, if you thought the new episode seemed a whole lot shorter, it wasn't you."	t5_2tayg	True

Not that it was bad, but as you've grown up your taste has clearly changed. Well Reddit, this is NOT one of those shows. 

If anything, this show has become even funnier for me. I'll admit, when I was younger there were a good amount of jokes I didn't understand, though there were many that brought me to tears (happy tears). Now that I'm 22, I understand everything so much better and am consistently wowed at how awesome this show is. 

Oh and the American version is way funnier. Sorry."	t5_2tayg	True

Two line vocabulary

Sound effects (both the normal version and the audience version)

I think it's probably pretty difficult to jump into a show like that, especially when you've never done it before. The first episode she seemed very uptight and more analytical than you're supposed to be on a show like this (like after Lauren Cohen kicked Wayne -- ""Well, on the Walking Dead they do their stunts and I Think that some of that came back to her and blah blah blah not really funny at all"")

She also seemed very loud with all the laughter... I don't know just not what Drew would ever do. Not saying she has to be an exact copy of Drew but it was just sort of annoying.

The episode she seemed to have sort of gotten a better idea of what to do though and I thought she did a lot better. She started joking around and sort of surprised me with several of her responses and whatnot. Hopefully she figured out it wasn't a talk show; it's a show where you make as many quick jokes as you can and some fail but most some can get people chuckling. She just needs to realize that she really doesn't actually do anything and has to try to get in and out quickly without killing the vibe of the show.

Do you think it would read better if they were in the format 'The points don't matter, just like a good looking radio presenter' , or do you think it better suits the current way of 'Just like a good looking radio presenter, the points don't matter'

First off, I'm not particularly fond of Aisha Tyler as the host, I really don't think she's all that funny. Secondly, I find that it reduces the quality of the guest stars by having one EVERY single episode. I liked it better when it was more audience involvement and an occasional guest star. Thirdly, I like some of the new scenes, like sideways scene, but they need more variety. I'd also like the old Irish drinking songs and the hoedowns back.

Don't get me wrong, the show is still very funny but, in my opinion, could be funnier if they kept parts of the old format.

1) Where are the audience suggestions? With the old show, the host would ask about 2 times per show for audience suggestions. Now, there aren't any. For me, it's what made it funnier.

2) It seems to already be a little bit repetitive. For example, the 3 sideway scenes are almost identical (first cut is a creepy-scary scene and the cut after is an acrobatic-kungfu scene).

3) Already a lack in the variety of games. With 25 games played to date, only 14 different games were played.

4) As pointed out already, new guests on every show may be too much.

1345058330.0	y9ymy	How should we use the new wiki system at /r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway?	Ytoabn	11	1	4	"Some of you may not be aware that Reddit has recently implemented a [Wiki System](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/y9ulv/moderators_try_out_a_beta_of_the_new_wiki_system/) that every subreddit can use. What's out there right now is simply a beta test, and will be wiped out when the real deal is ready. Still, this brings us to the question: Should we try to setup a wiki for this subreddit.

On the one hand there's already plenty of existing resource: whoselineonline.org, wikipedia.org, [Raezeman](http://www.youtube.com/user/Raezeman) and [12Medbe](http://www.youtube.com/user/12Medbe)'s YouTube Accounts. There may be no need to duplicate all the work they've already done. Not to mention it would be a LOT of work no matter how small the project consider we're talking about a show with hundreds of hours of footage.

On the other hand we could try to build a wiki that would not only keep track of every episode and game, but also maybe keep track of different jokes and quotes. People are always asking for the source, but truthfully I'm not always able to find it. Maybe the Wiki could be used to give a source to all the clips, images, and quotes floating out there.

Sound off and let us know how we should use this wiki. Keep in mind that no matter what we decide the wiki is still in beta, so we wouldn't be able to make any progress on any kind of project til it's stable."	t5_2tayg	True

[This is an enhanced version](http://i.imgur.com/rW5Lt) so the text is more legible. It says ""To Becky xx Love+Luck Josie Lawrence"". 
[This is the back of the photo](http://imgur.com/2WENQ), which has also been manipulated to sharpen the text. (It's not actually that gross. It's been in the same picture frame from home to home for twenty years.) It says: 
Dear Becky 
Thanks for your letter. 
In answer to your questions - No I am not married! 
I choose the amount of shows I wish to do so that's why I'm not always on the programme. 
love Josie x 
Here's the story. In 1992, Whose Line is it Anyway ran on Comedy Central in the states. I was twelve. I caught the second episode after school one day, and found myself hooked. Josie Lawrence was quickly one of my greatest heroines. 
I penned her a letter and enclosed a button that I had made for her (a cow wearing sunglasses, classy). I slapped two stamps on it and having no idea who to address it to, I wrote as follows: 
Hat Trick Studios 
C/O Josie Lawrence 
Somewhere in England 
Two weeks later, I received a letter from England. I thought that it was from my pen-pal that I had at the time. The back of the envelope said ""PS - Thanks for the lovely button!"" Inside was the reply from Josie.

1343824851.0	xi48h	Want to play a Whose Line Game with other Redditors? Check out /r/ScenesFromAHat &amp; /r/RedditImprov	Ytoabn	10	2	2	"If you've ever wanted to try your own one liners during Scenes from a Hat, or had your own perfect World's Worst but never got a chance to tell anyone, try out these subreddits:

/r/ScenesFromAHat focuses exclusively on the Scenes from a Hat game. Redditors are invited to start a thread with a Scene that might get pulled out of Drew or Clive's All American Hat. From there, every one can jump in and comment with a clever line. This game works extremely well on Reddit as the voting system can be used to decide the best line.

/r/RedditImprov has an expanded focus on nearly any Improv game, both those seen on Whose Line and ones that are used more by other Improv groups. Scenes from a Hat are welcome here as well as World's Worst, If You Know What I Mean, or Sentences. 

I'm introducing these two subreddits along with an announcement for /r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway. I believe these two subreddits already have the Whose Line Games down pretty well, and I like that there's a separate subreddit for it. Therefore /r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway will stay dedicated to videos and images, and any posts that want to play Whose Line games will be redirected to /r/ScenesFromAHat and /r/RedditImprov . Not a very big announcement since the community in general seems to be focused on videos and images, but I just wanted to make it official and clear.

**/r/WhoseLineIsItAnyway is for videos and images from Whose Line Is It Anyway and any other shows featuring the Whose Line cast.** We also welcome self posts asking questions or requesting a certain clip. Self posts that want to play Whose Line type games with Redditors should go to /r/ScenesFromAHat or /r/RedditImprov .

Miss_Aviya	10	12	6	"I am new to this subreddit so please excuse me if these things have been brought up before, but I felt like discussing with people the new season of Whose Line. Since I don't really know people that are into it I figured it was worth posting here.

I guess the first thing most people notice is the new host, Aisha. I've seen a lot of people kind of bashing on her as a host and as a part of the Whose Line crew. I do agree with most people that she doesn't seem to fit the flow of the show. She almost seems to rush it. Also she does not take part in the games herself. Why I liked Drew so much was because I didn't feel like I was watching a tv show as much as it felt like I was just watching a bunch of friends be funny together. Their banter and jokes with one another was part of what made the show so special.


Secondly, the celebrity guest appearances are every episode and personally I do not like that. I miss the crowd interaction, the awkwardness and pure gold of normal peoples reactions.

Another thing is the new games. I do like some, like the ""special mat"" game.. I forgot it's actual name, but they lay on the ground and perform a scene. It is a great concept and it's a ton of fun to watch as Colin looks like hes performing intense physical stunts.

However, games like ""What's in the bag?"" that game is just horrid. Ryan took a womans purse from the audience and literally threw her pills on the floor. Nothing about that game was entertaining to me, but perhaps others liked it.

I am extremely happy to see Whose Line back on tv. It is truly a delightful show that I love. I feel with some minor tweaks it could easily be another hit tv show. I do kind of worry that they won't make the much need tweaks and will continue to run the show as is. I don't know if it will last if they do that."	t5_2tayg	True
