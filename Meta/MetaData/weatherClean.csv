There seem to be a lot of threads--some duplicate--of single images or videos of the [devastating tornado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Moore_tornado) in Moore, OK, yesterday. I thought it'd be good to have a single thread dedicated to the topic to cut down on the number of Moore-related pic/video topics.

I'll start.

A while back I posted this link: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/weather/comments/1ft2el/while_waiting_for_reddit_ownership_of/

For an official Andrea thread, something I plan to do in /r/tropicalweather all throughout tropical season. Many of you liked it and thought it was a good idea. My request for /r/tropicalweather has gone through and will feature some of the same mods as /r/weather. It will be a place to focus on tropical weather during hurricane season!

If any of you would like to contribute with things like CSS, meteorological analysis (I'm looking for official meteorologists to give flair to!), etc. at /r/tropicalweather, or even help moderate, I would be very thankful! It always seemed silly that there was no dedicated tropical weather subreddit, as the tropical weather forums on the internet are HUGE and filled with information. Here is my welcome to the new subreddit posted in /r/tropicalweather:

http://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1gajtb/welcome_to_rtropicalweather_help_set_up_this/


Come on by and post suggestions, make your own posts, etc.

I'll be working hard on getting the subreddit up and going."	t5_2qi0i	True

1360349742.0	1859k4	Blizzard of '78 is in the news. Here's how my family survived. Redditors who remember, add your story.	TheKolbrin	33	4	7	"My mother and I were visiting a family friend, Carl, 50 miles north of home when it started. Back then radar technology was not what it is today and you got little notice on storms. Carls house was in the country and had woodburners and fireplace and was pretty well stocked. Power went out about mid-day of the blizzard. The wind blew so hard that the house was literally shaking and windows rattling so hard we thought they would break. It was so loud we nearly had to yell to be heard.

Looking out the front window you could see nothing - not even a large pine tree about 4ft away. Solid looking wall of white - going sideways.

By next morning Carl had to climb out the kitchen window to tackle the 4+ ft of snow that had piled up against the doors and then froze solid. 

Mid-morning some neighbors came by with snowmobiles pulling sleds - taking grocery orders for the little local grocery that the owner had opened for people down the hill. I went with them. Power poles were down everywhere and we had to be very careful trying to avoid downed lines.

The grocery had no power but the owner was there handing out bread - 2 loaves per household - and milk plus whatever else. He put his meat in milk crates and set them outside. 

Meanwhile my Grandmother was alone in their big house out in the country. Grandfather was in Germany at the time. We could not contact her- phones were out with the electric. Their house had a big fireplace but it was in a big open living/dining room so we were worried.

Finally my Vietnam vet Uncle was able to hike 1/2 mile to his neighbors -who had a Bulldozer and farm tank of gas. He later said he thought he was going to die just trying to get there. They were about 10 miles from my grandmothers - and they wrapped the cab in plastic, bundled up and drove that damn bulldozer all the way to grandmas. 

They found her feeding wood into the fireplace but it was still only 38 degrees in the house. On the lowest floor of the house the only source of running water that she had been using- the 'little' bathroom in the basement- pipes had finally just frozen up. So they put gran in a couple of sleeping bags and took her back to my Uncles - saving a guy stuck in a truck along the way.

My dad rescued 12 people from nearly buried cars on the freeway on his way home the day the blizzard started. He had a four wheel drive vehicle. He dropped them all off at a hotel at the last freeway exit before his house. The hotel had no power - but it did have some rooms, food and blankets.

So those are just a few of the things that happened with my family in the Blizzard of '78.

70% of the city is without power.

06:03 - St Bernards reporting 12 inches of rain so far. More expected.

06:57 - St John the Baptist Parish - water has been shut off.
Possible levee breech near hwy 39. People are trying to call 911 but not getting through.

07:00 - current winds at 80mph, Hurricane moving NW at 6mph.

08:00 - water under the eaves of houses in St. Bernard parish.
local shrimp boats rescuing people who didnt evacuate from the area.

08:10 - Levees overtopped in Braithwaite.

News reports lots of trees knocked down, but so-far no widespread levee breeches or any problems encountered during Katrina.  Winds expected to remain 30 - 50mph for the remainder of the day. 

Tornado watch in effect till 4pm CDT

Eye of hurricane now over SW Louisiana. Lots of local footage of surrounding areas. New Orleans is mostly unaffected, but local forecast calls for strong winds with gusts up to 90 mph. Hurricane still moving NW at 6mph.

Lots of conjecture - people saying ""this is just like Katrina"" - but flooding looks like flooding wherever you are.

09:00 - Tornado warning in Mississippi

10:13 - News getting desperate: Interviewing a guy named Isaac and his knocked-down tree. 

10:20 - News interviewed tourists who came to New Orleans just to see what a Category 1 hurricane looks like.

11:40 - Dusk to Dawn curfew in effect. NWS is estimating that flood waters will continue to rise through the day and into the evening.

11:45 - eye of hurricane is 45 mil SW of New Orleans, winds 75 MPH. Isaac moving NW at a very slow 6mph.

12:00 - numerous rescues taking place in Braithwaite - people rescued were shocked at how quickly water rose. Rescue crews working hard to rescue everyone.

12:09 - rescued home-owner reports water raised 6 feet in five minutes: ""Im getting too old for this shit.""

One person rescued by using Facebook to send out calls for help.

13:00 - multiple road closures due to flooding. Officials telling residents of low-lying areas that if they can get out, they should. 

Leaving work for the day, so no further updates to this post. Thanks for all the support. Keep the threads alive and stay safe!

1370543486.0	1ft2el	While waiting for reddit ownership of /r/tropicalweather, I figured I would start an Andrea thread here. (Obs/Models/Updates)	_supernovasky_	26	5	17	"Hey guys! So /r/tropicalweather is an abandoned sub, and I feel like the /r/weather community could benefit from a specialized subreddit dedicated to tropical weather for those of us who live in the coast. I have decided to claim it, and it will take 3 days for the claim to go through. There is a huge need for information about tropical weather, and with 5 different forums on the internet dedicated to tropical weather with over a million posts, I've been quite shocked that there has not been a dedicated tropical weather subreddit. 

I plan on recruiting other tropical weather enthusiasts and giving flair to official meteorologists in the subreddit, but that is for the future once I can get ownership there. Until then, new posts do not even show up in the abandoned sub. So I wanted to post my first tropical storm update post here and allow you guys to run with it. Any suggestions on what resources I should add would be wonderful! And anyone interested in /r/tropicalweather should PM me if they would like to help set up the sub.


So with no further adieu, here is how the thread will work and the relevant info:

----------------


This is the official thread for Andrea. 


This is the first of what I hope to be many official threads in this forum. Once we have mods and meteorologists, the information can be updated much more efficiently and once we have enough subscribers, we can use this sub as a source for good, accurate, up to date information on hurricane preparation, the status of hurricanes, and the aftermath along with ways to help our neighbors in tropical weather prone areas.

With sustained winds of 100mph, gusting to 120 it should be a good show. Most of the forecast models have it running literally right over my house, so there won't be any chasing this time, just a couple beers and a camera.  If it makes landfall after first light I should get some great footage &amp; be able to promptly share it.

1365185695.0	1bqxva	Per request, Cross-Sectional Analysis explained.	Hixt	22	4	1	"Someone asked in /r/meteorology for a good explanation of [this cross-section analysis product](http://i.imgur.com/EZyPjVx.gif) and how to interpret them.  These can be a little hard to understand, so I figured I would go in depth and discuss what’s going on here.  These products can be found at the [CoD NEXLAB](http://weather.cod.edu) site, in the analysis data section, under Cross-Sectional Analysis.  

This product is essentially a cross section of the atmosphere, based on observed data taken by [radiosondes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosonde) (weather balloons), and illustrates how different properties of the atmosphere vary in the vertical and horizontal between two points.  In this image, the two points are Denver, CO and Wilmington, OH.  Those two locations are listed at the top of the image.  The top most location is the left side of the image, and the second location is the right side of the image.  There are a few different ways to identify stations: 4 letter identifiers (KDNR), 5 digit identifiers (72469), and obviously the name of the location.  On the very bottom of the image are numerous 5 digit identifiers that represent various locations between the two main points.  A quick google search can yield what sites those actually are.

The bottom of the image is in gray.  This gray represents the ground.  As you can see, as we move east from Denver, we are decreasing in elevation (makes sense).  The horizontal gray dashed lines are the elevation.  Pressure is labeled on the left, but there are no isobars in the image.  Just know that they go straight across, and it is the elevations that will vary slightly.

There is a legend at the bottom to denote what isopleths are what values, but it’s slightly ambiguous so here are some better descriptions:

The solid red lines represent Theta, or [potential temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_temperature), which is a measure of real heat.  

[Wind barbs](http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/info/about_windbarb.html) represent just what you’d expect, winds at those locations and heights.  It’s important to understand that even though this is a cross section product, and it’s as if you’re looking at the atmosphere from the side, the wind barbs are a horizontal depiction, so it’s as if you’re looking at them from above.  In other words, a wind barb pointing down is really pointing to the south, not into the ground.

The solid green lines represent [Mixing Ratio](http://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=mixing%20ratio), also known as W to us weather geeks.  Just think of this as an absolute measure of moisture in the air.

The solid blue line represents [Wet-Bulb Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature), and we only plot the zero-degree (C) line.  In case you were wondering, it is not the same as the [Dewpoint Temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point), which is not depicted in these images.  The zero-degree line can be helpful for winter forecasting.

Last, but certainly not least are the dashed yellow lines.  These represent Theta-e, or the [Equivalent Potential Temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_potential_temperature).  Theta-e is a measure of total heat.  It takes into account both real heat and moisture.  

We use cross sections like this to help us understand how the atmosphere varies in both the vertical and horizontal.  It’s great for getting an idea of what kind of advection, or horizontal transfers are taking place.  It’s also great for showing how deep certain properties extent above the ground.  Take the mixing ratio line for example, remember that it’s a measure of absolute humidity.  Not only can you see in this image that some places have more moisture than others at the surface, but that this moisture extends into the atmosphere deeper in some places than others.  While there isn’t a great setup currently to show some other neat examples, there will be times when you can see a strong flow advecting higher moisture values into a region, or where subsidence is leading to the intrusion of dry air.  Also, areas where Theta-e decreases with height are convectively unstable, so this can also be used to assess thunderstorm potential.  Like any other meteorological product, this should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools to gain a better understanding of the atmosphere.  These are just useful because they illustrate things in a pretty unique way, and may help bring things to your attention better than other products can."	t5_2qi0i	True

However, I grew up in PA and my experience with hurricanes is, we get a massive amount of rain, a few thunderstorms, wind and not much else. These storms rarely impact us. Now, I live about 20 miles over the boarder in Jersey. I'm actually kind of intimdated by this Irene one, maybe is the media scare tactics, but it seems like we are going to be hit with the eye of the storm and tornadoes, and the whole hurricane experience.

So my question is two-fold. For starters, how bad will it really hit New Jersey? And secondly, what exactly should I be doing in preparation?


TL,DR Hurricane Irene is going to hit NJ...how badly will it hit NJ? What should I do to prepare? 

Edit-- After thought... I live in Flemmington, NJ. Don't know if this impacts how it will hit or not.

So a little back story, I was visiting family down in Baton Rouge and went for a game of golf at the University Course. Beautiful day, but NOAA called for pop up storms that day, but there was a low probability for severe. This was also about a month after I first got certified for spotting. Anyway, this developed right in front if my face as I came around from a green to a tee, like magic. Although it was fairly far and moving away. 

So for those who know better than I do, nothing about this funnel's parent storm looks tornadic. Hell I didn't even see a wall cloud, although it may have been obscured as the rotation was very hard to see unless I was observing through my zoomed camera. Why did this happen? I am assuming if this touched down it probably would have been EF-0, so if this kind of weak development common in small tornadoes? Sorry for rambling it is very early, and I appreciate everyone's input.

 Is it just that the Fujita scale is damage-based and therefore limited to the strength of the structures and items impacted? I.e. a stronger tornado may be rated lower because it didn't hit something capable of showing EF5 damage? I'm not sure I could imagine damage being much more intense than that.

PepeAndMrDuck	17	1	15	"Ever since I can remember, I've been obsessed with weather. Fast forward to college. Feshman year I took an Intro to Weather class, MET1010 at University of Florida. 

Fast forward even more, and I'm a junior with the same major I had declared upon coming in, Biotechnology in the CALS. I'm almost done with this stupid major now, and I plan to go on to grad school or med school, most likely for optometry, but I'm thinking more and more about a career in meteorology as I go along.

I'm a little confused though:
What exactly does a meteorologist *do* if you're not the weatherman in front of the camera? (I'm not comfortable with TV) What kind of physical research opportunities are there that somebody with a biotechnology (includes chemistry/physics/maths/statistics) degree would be suited for? What kind of opportunities and careers would someone with a meteorology-related major that is offered at state schools like UF find in the real world, and with what companies or entities? I have looked for these sorts of classes but couldn't find anything and I'm convinced there's nothing closer to what I want than a physics major, which is something I don't want. To give you an idea of some of the goings on at my school in terms of astrophysics, here's [the page](http://www.phys.ufl.edu/faculty/matcheva.shtml) of my met1010 teacher from freshman year. Wonderful teacher. I asked her the same questions as here, but I believe her answer was to continue with higher physics which is something I don't think would be worthwhile for me at this point.

Another question: I've always dreamt of continuing my biotechnology major for undergrad and then going on to some degree or job where I can mix meteorological science with biological science. Like maybe the research aspect of public health or something. Are there any paths like this that stick out to any of you?
