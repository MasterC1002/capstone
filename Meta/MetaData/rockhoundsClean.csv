1376828618.0	1kloqs	I know this isn't the typical post here, but I really wanted to let this community know you have saved my life and I thought you folks would appreciate my story moreso than another sub.	RockandFossilCurious	68	5	38	"I know this isn't /depression or /self or /confession, but I don't think they'd understand what I'm trying to say. And to anyone who takes the time to read this, thank you :) 

A bit of a back story for context: I was a geology major in college and really took a liking to mineralogy and petrology but due to financial issues, and a mistake on the schools part, I was never able to finish. I am now 6 years out of college, unemployed (minus an art business I have started up to help with a bit of extra income while I'm waiting for ANY call back from a job). I have been clinically depressed for over 10 years and have serious anxiety problems (I'm in the processes of getting medical help so that's not an issue). 

Being so wrapped up in my depression, I was focused on doctors and medication for a long time, not really focusing on physically doing things that would make me happy b/c it was so hard to comprehend being able to do those things, like a wall is put up in front of you and you can't break through it or climb over it (I hope that made sense). 

ANYWAY, the last year I started to realize that when my husband and I went to our local park districts (places we've been going to our whole lives), I'd find really beautiful pieces of granite, gneiss, calcite and quartz crystals, plus many things I have yet to ID. I have **no idea** why, after 5 years of geology courses (and local field trips), I never thought to look in our area for minerals or fossils. We've been going on hikes at these parks for over 15 years and I never once thought to rockhound. Geocaching sure, but for some reason I didn't think we had anything special around here even though we have major rivers and reservoirs and are right next to the Great Lakes with tons of glacial till. **It wasn't until I subscribed to this sub that my life changed**. 

Well, over the course of this past year (2013), I've become *obsessed* (seriously, I have an addiction to it now) with rockhounding for 3 reasons. 

1. You're finding amazing treasures from millions of years ago and can *hold it in your hand*. How INSANE and AMAZING is that??
2. It's been *unbelievably* therapeutic for my anxiety and depression (and is WAY cheaper than a therapist and antidepressants lol). I haven't been suicidal or cut since I started hounding. With the way life has been for us for the last 5 years (illnesses, homelessness and unemployment), that's a HUGE accomplishment. 
3. I get to spend quality bonding time with my husband. He doesn't see all of the things I find amazing like I do, but he appreciates what I'm doing and what I find and is always there to lend a hand when I need to crack a rock open (can't afford a hammer or chisel yet). Not to mention he is more than encouraging of me taking up this hobby and running with it. He even made me a rock box :)

In any case, this subreddit has been nothing but helpful and kind to me and anyone else posting here. You don't often find that on Reddit these days, especially in the more specialized subs. So I wanted to say **thank you** to everyone in this sub that has helped others ID  their specimens and gave their knowledge when asked by others. Just by helping to ID rocks and encouraging others to appreciate what they've found, even if it's just quartz or slag, you've saved a life. **Thank you**, from the bottom of my heart. 

**edit**: I just wanted to add one more thing. I really look forward to posting my finds here to show them off and to get some help with ID's. Looking forward to that gives me great comfort in a time when I don't have that feeling very often :)

**edit #2**: I also forgot to mention that I have learned *so much* from everyone here. I can ID rocks much better than I used to be able to and certain things click now that didn't before, making things much easier on me lol Thank you for teaching me!

**edit #3**: I knew this would be the right place to post this. Thank you *all* so much for your support and words of encouragement. I wish I could express how much posting this and reading your responses have helped me and brightened up my month! I was hesitant to post this but I am beyond glad I did. You guys rock (pun intended) :) Thank you again and I look forward to posting some pieces soon!

**tl;dr: this sub got me into rockhounding after 6 years of being away from the field and 10+ years of severe depression and anxiety and it has saved my life. Thank you :)**"	t5_2rbfx	True

1374690715.0	1iz0ge	Is it a meteorite? A quick guide to self-identification of your meteorwrong.	Sloth269	33	4	7	"In the past 6 months or so, interest in meteorites is way up. I decided to make a small post to show you that your rock is not a meteorite.

My background: I am a researcher at a major American research institution with a meteoritics group. I deal with public inquiries on a daily basis, usually 4 to 5.

Meteorite realities: In the last twenty years, there has been one public inquiry to our institution that actually turned out to be a meteorite.  Quick math shows that is probably 1 out of 20000. The odds are very against your rock being a meteorite.

So where are meteorites found? Almost all meteorites nowadays are found in deserts, with the two biggest collection areas being the Antarctic and Northwest Africa. Besides that, known previous falls and current falls are a good place to find them. Your backyard is not.

So how do you know it is quickly not a meteorite? If it has holes in it, vesicles, weathered out portions, whatever, it is not a meteorite. It is either slag or terrestrial. Simply put, no air in space=no bubbles.

Other things that will immediately tell you it is not a meteorite include the following:
Layering/laminations, very round, very angular, thick crust, presence of quartz,  planar veins, fractures, and many many other things.

By far the best site for meteorite ID online is found [here](http://meteorites.wustl.edu/realities.htm)

How to get a good response from an expert:
The best way to get a response from an expert is to be polite and thorough. Tell me what research you did that made you think it is a meteorite. Show me you did your homework and I will gratefully tell you why you are probably wrong. You should include several well lit photos from multiple angles. Include something for scale! Tell us where you found it. Be as specific as possible. If possible, use a grinder or file to file an edge down. If you see little metal flakes, give us a picture of those! More data is always better.

When writing your request your ID, again be polite and use common sense.

Example of what not to do:
Can u give me a call at xxxxxxxxxhow can I get my meteorite certifieD my name is xxxxxx u can call me xxxx thank u

That is an actual email I received in the last week. You should try to make the ID request as painless as possible for the person. I will not find time to play phone tag with you about your meteowrong and it is nearly impossible to do IDs over the phone anyhow.

Another thing to not do is email the entire meteorite community in one go. Seeing all our colleagues emailed in one shot just means we will all ignore you and/or assume some one else answered you.

Finally, when you get your response, try not to argue with the person. Feel free to give us more information or clarify something, but telling me I am wrong is not going to win me over. We really do know what we are doing for the most part.

Another big thing to remember is that all rocks that fall from the sky are not meteorites. The FAAs dirty little secret is how often stones will get caught in airplane tires and fall off when landing gear is deployed.  Yeah, I believe you that the rock fell from the sky and damaged your siding, but it is not a meteorite.

Feel free to ask me any questions about meteorite ID or the process that goes in to classifying/confirming a meteorite!

I was actually less impressed with the results [at the pit](http://imgur.com/je2uMCE) than I am on the roads. I consistently find more impressive agates and petrified wood pieces on the roads than I do at the pits. 

Aside from that though, here are some pictures of the more interesting pieces I found this time. Please pardon the dishes/my gross finger in the images.

Her territory was the area around Colorado springs, a perfect location from a geological standpoint for a gem nut. Recently, my Grandmother died and we've inherited all her stuff, which includes all of what she had had of my Great-Grandmothers stuff. We found this rock among boxes upon boxes of rocks.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/7VmC0)

Rock hunting is a bit of a thing in my family, and none of us have seen anything quite like this. When we found it, I commented on how odd it was and how it almost resembled a stereotypical meteorite. In me saying so, my mom remembered that my great-grandmother had related to her in that one year, she had found a meteorite. She had cut it in half with her lapidary saw and donated one piece to her local Natural History museum. My family thinks this may be the other half of her meteorite.

Resident geologists, what do you think?

The rock has a volume roughly that of a grapefruit, and is about 10lbs.
It is black, very dense, very smooth to the touch- almost as if shellacked, is attractive to magnets and seems to be speckled with a iron-bearing mineral (which are the parts the magnet sticks to the most).

I took it to a rock shop and were very condescending towards me and made it obvious they didn't even give it a piece of mind. 

I just want to know what it is as it is a very interesting piece and as someone who is just starting out on a geology degree I am eager for and new knowledge I could get."	t5_2rbfx	True

1365797018.0	1c87ae	Pics of rocks are great, but how about sharing some stories.	sixtrees	22	1	26	"I love to look at pics of rocks as much as any other rockhound. But how about sharing some funny or interesting stories of things that have happened while out collecting. Here is something that happened to me.

I was backpacking across Australia years ago, and was getting burnt out from traveling nonstop for a few months. So I got out of Sydney, and traveled north to the small beach town of Coffs Harbour, and stayed there for a while. One day I was out walking the coastline and hiked up a hill with a viewpoint. I could see far to the north there was a semi hidden secluded cove with a high cliff face all around it. I started heading toward that cove while walking along the waters edge collecting beach rocks and shells. The closer I got to the cove the quality of the rocks and shells got better. When I got to the edge of the cove there was a rock wall about chest high to climb over. Well where the rock met the beach it formed sort of a trap for debris that washed up. There were  polished rocks and shells all around. I noticed a few people were laying on the beach in the cove, but I was focused on the rocks. So I would crouch down to pick up a rock, stand back up, and repeat over and over. After a while two guys from the cove side came over the rock wall and walked past me. I smiled at them and nodded. They both looked at me like I was someone they would like to stab in the kidney as they walked past. I didn't think much of it, and I continue to collect stuff, and after a while someone else walks up behind me. He walks up to me and asks ""just what do you think you are doing?"" I tell him I am collecting rocks and shells, and show him a handful of my finds. He looks a bit suspicious of my answer, and says ""well you should know this is a nude beach, and it looks like you are peeping"". Oh my god!!! I had been ducking down and standing up over and over, I am sure if anyone saw me they would think I had been getting my perv on. But I was completely unaware that it was a known nude beach.

tl;dr I was collecting rocks and shells on a beach, but to anyone else it looked like I was perving on nudists.

My child (6F) is fanatically interested in rocks and I do not know where to take it.	bob1980	23	1	25	"As the title describes, my oldest child has found a passion with rocks.  We (wife and I) are very dedicated to providing our children with an environment that they can explore the world around them and do what interests them the most.  To that end, we want to help her cultivate this interest and provide her with the necessary resources and materials.

We have checked out several books on geology and crystals, including one filled with craft ideas, which we have been helping her do (like make your own volcano, build a geologists notebook, grow your own crystals, etc.)  We have also taken several special trips to local areas (indy, IN) for her to dig and search for rocks.  I just do not know enough to answer her questions.  

She also told Santa that she wants a rock polisher for christmas (quite a change from dolls of last year) so that she can shine her rocks to give to friends.

Can someone guide us to the starting point on this journey?  
What resources are available for kids and geology/rockhounding? 
 Is there a recommendation on a rock polisher that would be age appropriate?

1370054040.0	1ffzsl	Alright r/rockhounds, here's my contribution; best of 2013 so far.	PapaShane	18	0	6	"So, this spring has been eventful for me as far as collecting goes.  Here's what I've found!

First off, a few months ago I promised to show the gem cutting work of /u/letstalkaboutrocks...sent in some garnet I collected a few years ago on a trip to the Barton garnet mine in the Adirondacks, got some gorgeous round cuts in return!  [Before](http://i.imgur.com/xfWbE) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/XqY7b8h).  I'm thrilled with them!  Each is 0.4 carats, internally flawless, and a gorgeous deep red.

Next was a trip to a Pennsylvania locale known to have some dinosaur tracks.  Well, the trip was successful!  My buddy and I managed to get a slab or two with some decent Atriepus milfordensis (small dino with three-toed rear footprint) tracks, as well as a few reptile tracks and such scattered in there.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/1ZEIjO0) one on a big slab (note the pen for scale) and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/DW9HH3L) two nice reverse imprints on another slab.  It was my first time finding anything dino-related and I was quite pleased!

After that were a few trips to bone locations throughout Pennsy, found a few chunks of bone and maybe a phytosaur tooth, but not much worth photographing.  My buddy did find some osteoderms (which apparently were bony body armor a la a reptilian armadillo) and a possible jaw bone though, so that was pretty neat.

After that, we tripped to a nearby farm to hunt for quartz crystals.  Yeah yeah I know, quartz is kinda boring, but it was easy and fun to find them and we all found some nice samples.  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/g1vjSaP) the main collection, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/e2xmQUr) are my favorites from that trip.  Will be fun to wrap some and turn them into necklaces and whatnot.  Sorry for not providing a scale, they're pretty small though (the biggest is ~3cm).

The next trip was to a trilobite location.  The trilobite Phacops rana is PA's state fossil, and I was lucky enough to find one all stretched out and in great shape (though missing an eye I guess).  [This picture](http://i.imgur.com/Zpu1axU) has scale included, you can see that it's a decent sized fellow!  I think [this one](http://i.imgur.com/SfdITGJ) is a better pic though (with more quartz in the background).  The same location also provided some nice bivalves [like this one](http://i.imgur.com/TZIZlom), with limonite all over them, some nice big [brachiopods](http://i.imgur.com/HosWca3), a hefty [mollusk](http://i.imgur.com/qNPAKGQ), and a very interesting death bed of bivalves, crinoids, bryozoans, mollusks, and the like.  [Here's a photo from above](http://i.imgur.com/rdC0xuS) and [here's a close-up](http://i.imgur.com/2x2T0sr).

So yeah, that's been my year so far, figured I'd share with people who might be interested!  Also, feel free to add information or correct me if I have any ID's wrong, I'm no paleo buff.

I made this thread yesterday but it seems that the free webhost crapped out on me, so I uploaded it to a new place. I made a rough version of the identification tool I talked about [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rockhounds/comments/1fh1gz/identification_tool_feedback/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rockhounds/comments/1f7xjy/id_like_to_give_back_to_the_community/). It's a very early version, none of the links go anywhere yet and I've probably made some mistakes inputting the mineral information(I got all my info from minerals.net). 

I would really appreciate any and all feedback, questions, comments and complaints so I could make this tool as awesome as possible. I will update everything as I go along and keep everyone informed. Thank you. "	t5_2rbfx	True

1370108690.0	1fh1gz	Identification tool feedback	nostromopassanger	17	1	8	"So I posted a thread not too long ago about creating something for the community([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rockhounds/comments/1f7xjy/id_like_to_give_back_to_the_community/)) and the most upvoted suggestion was an easy to use identification tool. I have made a few mockups in the previous thread, but wasn't getting any feedback so I decided to make a new thread(I tried avoiding it). 

Here are the rough mockups:

http://i.imgur.com/1ZD5901.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/HULiCoL.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/Fb3H7ag.jpg 

So the way I see it work is you are presented with some questions and as you answer them the number of possible rocks gets fewer and fewer, until only one (or very few possibilities) remain. Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions on what you would find useful. 

A member of a different forum suggested the identification process should be as follows:

1)  Metallic or non-metallic luster
2)  Mafic or Felsic 
3)  Hardness (Glass is a 5, determine if it is harder or softer)
4)  Cleavage
5)  Reaction to HCl
6)  Streak test

Any feedback on that? 

Also any feedback on the general direction? Would you use this sort of tool? I've had few other suggestions on what to create and I would like to create something that would benefit the largest amount of rockhounds, so I'm not yet set on any particular idea. "	t5_2rbfx	True

Jasper of every imaginable color, and moss agates by the pound out here. I could spend weeks and fill a truck bed with them. I am currently intrigued by tales of fist-sized chunks of Carnelian and various colors of Jade, but I'm afraid my eye isn't that well trained yet. Lots of chalcedony, and I am very interested to learn more about those white/clear banded agates I have been finding, as they are gorgeous. I want to find a way to cleanly break the larger ones to attempt some jewelry work with them. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Apparently the area sits on an old floodplain for an ancient river than ran from the north, depositing all this igneous and hydrothermal aggregate, over a sedimentary basin.

Also, since I have gotten a few PMs regarding where I have found the fossils and all these agates, I am willing to take people out if they are interested, but the area lies between public and private land, so some of the sections are off limits, but I have access to them. So if you are seriously interested, shoot me a PM and I will give you more info.

Probably a ton or two of it out there ;x	JohnnK	17	1	3	"Was in the garage and noticed a 5 gallon bucket of old mine tailings in the corner. GF made me toss everything in the woods behind the house, I guess I forgot to toss this bucket. Decided I'd take some pics and upload it.

The stuff behind the house is actually a lot more cool looking than this stuff but it's nighttime and most of it is covered with snow. There is probably a ton or two of it out there lol.

Feel free to chime in if anyone knows what any of this stuff is. Aside form the mica and pyrite, I'm not sure what any of it is.





Dunno what this is, maybe some kind of stained or tarnished pyrite? It's very yellow/orange looking.

The black areas on these rocks, under a magnifying glass, contain little specs of what *looks* like gold. They also came from what used to be a gold mine. No idea if it's gold or not, but whatever.

I got a rock tumbler for this past Christmas (FINALLY, I'd always wanted one but forgot as an adult, until my thoughtful husband reminded me how much I needed one in my life). Since then, I've been collecting specimens from around the farm where I grew up, and have been trying my hand at tumbling.

I've learned a lot along the way, and this I think is my first really successful batch. I have become a lot more choosy with what I put in the tumbler, and I think the results came out nicely because of that. So, if it's alright with you, I thought I'd share some of the better pieces out of this set, and ask a few questions as well.

I'll label all the images in the imgur gallery, and some will have questions about identification. I *think* I know what they all are, but I don't know much about them, and any information would be great to know.

I collected all of these in Southwestern Manitoba. Most of the material is scattered on the gravel roads at the farm, and that gravel is almost all taken (to the best of my knowledge) from the nearby gravel pits in Souris, Manitoba. Now that the pits have a new owner, I've heard you can finally actually enter them to rock hound again, so I've got plans to go to the pits directly next weekend and collect first hand, to see what else I can tumble.

In the mean time please enjoy, and if you have more information I'd love to hear it!

My apologies, I left the images at their original size so that the details could be seen. If you need smaller pictures let me know and I'll resize them all.

Everything is from Crawford Mountain (next to Wintergreen Mountain/resort), which is in the Appalachian mountains. Nothing quite as fancy as a lot of you guys are posting, but I have found some kinda neat stuff. Most stuff around here is combined with quartz.  

* [Some stranded epidote/chlorite in quartz](http://i.imgur.com/ZypQf.jpg) The top one is my best piece, it is very reflective and has a beautiful blue-green color.

* [Some more stranded epidote/chlorite in greenstone](http://i.imgur.com/hQvwH.jpg) Big one is kinda neat, carried it down a mountain.

* [Some more epidote/chlorite in quartz](http://i.imgur.com/bUumR.jpg) I have a bunch of these. The color is pretty cool on them, although it kinda sucks in the picture.

* [Some metal in white quartz](http://i.imgur.com/eyMLi.jpg) Not sure what the metal is, probably titanium or graphite. Found an area with lots of these.

* [Amethyst.](http://i.imgur.com/CuQSo.jpg) Not real crystals unfortunately. This stuff is absolutely everywhere... but it isnt really pretty amethyst. There are areas of garnet-turned-amethyst too and tons of small amethyst in shiny schist.

* [big Green/Purple/Red/Orange quartz](http://i.imgur.com/iksPZ.jpg) This stuff isn't pure quartz, it is more... cherty?. The bottom right purple stuff comes mostly in sheets. The orange in the left one is from some copper that is in it (there is a copper mine in the mountain, and all the copper/pyrite is in quartz). 

* [Yellow, red, pink, green, blue, white and purple quartz](http://i.imgur.com/w0xz1.jpg) Just showing off some of the various colors of quartz around here.

* [Melted granite that is cracked and filled with white quartz](http://i.imgur.com/hh54x.jpg). There is a stream with these things all over. This is one of the better melted ones.

* [Purple basalt with epidote greenstone+crystals filling in the gaps, and some white quartz](http://i.imgur.com/E4DXI.jpg). This stuff is pretty much everywhere at the bottom of the mountain. Some have reds in them too in addition to the green/purple/white.

* [Interesting piece of layered epidote greenstone where the layers have split and white quartz has filled in](http://i.imgur.com/x2DnZ.jpg). At the bottom are little epidote crystals. Maybe not pretty, but I think it is really interesting.

* [Layered schist with epidote crystals surrounded by quartz](http://i.imgur.com/cfDrH.jpg). Weird looking but neat.

* [Some blue quartz](http://i.imgur.com/rQu5J.jpg). Not my best blue quartz, but it I forgot to take pictures of my other big pieces and it is dark now.

I have some other stuff from the mountain, but that is a decent sampling of my collection. There is a lot of mica, so there are super shiny schists (gorgeous blue/green colors) but they dont photograph well. 

The valley to one side was heavily used by Native Americans to get through the Appalachian, and I have found 2 items that appear to be Native American in origin.

Anyway, living here has been my introduction to rockhounding.

[This] (http://www.minershop.com/reddit/MSW1681-CLOSE-NAT.jpg) is a close up of some of the crystals that has me mystified; [this] (http://www.minershop.com/reddit/MSW1681-CLOSE-SW.jpg) is the same pic, but under SW again.

Known minerals from these geodes are calcite, quartz, fluorite, and dolomite.  Suspected are sphalerite, anhydrite and maybe others.  The area is a limestone formation (either the Maury shale, or the Warsaw formation).  The shales are soaked in oil (kerogen?) and sometimes when a geode vug was cracked open a light mineral oil would pour out.

Any idea what the large yellow crystal might be?  I know it seems like fluorite, but something tells me no.  And the smaller fluorescent gold crystals?  I'm pretty sure the hydrocarbons are the activators in much of this material, but not sure about much else.

Spiritwalker85	14	2	8	"I was walking through the woods one day near where I live and ran across an area deep in the forest away from any houses, near a dried up creek/stream. The area has tons of crystals all over the ground and inside the ground. I'm guessing they're calcite, I took some photos. The area is about 100ft across I'd say and littered with crystals even digging a couple feet in the ground it's just chock full them. I'll provide some pictures below, I was wondering if anyone has run across this before or happened to know what sort of a place this is.

I'm in central Virginia area.

I haven't had a job in three years, ran out of unemployment after the company I worked for sold out and changed hands. The new company just deigned not to keep us after the sale went through and myself and four other people all lost our jobs after 2 solid years of hard work every day. I got severely depressed and still am to this day. 

Recently, I had to move everything out of my rental house of ten years to live with my mom 120 miles away in the sticks on a budget of $40 and a foodstamp card. All my stuff including most of my rocks are in storage back in my hometown. Needless to say, I'm depressed as hell, bored as hell and at this point I'm too broke to even get a job. So. I managed to bring a few goodies with me that I'd like to try selling. I need car insurance, new license plate tags and gas money (around $550), at which point at least I can drive to get a job or to rockhound up something good to sell, I don't know right now. I also need money to pay for treatment for depression, which at this time my parents are paying for, even though they live on a very limited income.

I don't even go for walks outside because I need new shoes and I don't want to wear these out. *sigh*

Anyway. On to the good stuff.

Rhodochrosite sphere, Peruvian base material, old stock stuff. Gemmy pink crystals with multiple fortifications. Nice polish, this thing is a real piece of art. Never dropped. Roughly 3.1"" across, 2.5 lbs.

So, hydrochloric would be the acid most people would grab, but the problem is that it dissolves the diopside, which can sometimes be poking out of the center of garnets or just look so good you don't want to burn them off.  So, I tried nitric acid, which worked great, but didn't last long at all, then I tried just micro-abradding the calcite away, but that was super time intensive.  Then, a friend told me he tried some phosphoric acid and it worked like a charm.  

I grabbed a bottle of ""PH Down"", which is basically, 30% phosophoric acid.  Wow, it worked beautifully, now I have half of them cleaned and I was saving all the largest pieces for last.  A 14 gallon rubber made container worth, full of big fat pods of calcite to remove.  But I ran out of acid.  So, off to the Hydroponic shop I went to get more.  A friend told me that I could get it much cheaper at the hardware store, but the stuff he had was this green glop, as opposed to PH Down's clear liquid.  But then, checking the prices, I saw that they sell DRY PH Down!  After doing a little bit of math, it all made sense...2.2 pounds of acid for $10.00 vs. a gallon for $35.00.  Now, if you do the math, 2.2 pounds of acid, plus 6.2 pounds of water is nearly a gallon, or around 30% ish, so I figured there was no difference and went home to mix the powder into a gallon jug and start on the next batch.  

Too bad the powder is Urea Phosphate.

Who the hell pissed in my acid?

It is not removing any calcite.  D'oh.  Glad I didn't buy the 16 pound box.

1341804785.0	w93zd	Found garnet and beryl while rock hunting in the Manitoba Whiteshell	Luinbariel	16	1	11	"Just wanted to share some of the pictures of what we found!

I'd been rockhounding in the Whiteshell for a few years, as my husband's family has a cabin in the area and there are a lot of old abandoned quarries and a ton of exposed rock. I'd been finding a lot of various types of quartz (some rose quartz, smokey quartz, etc) and feldspar, as well as mica and the like.

But a couple of months ago someone let me know about a different quarry we hadn't visited yet and, better still... the second quarry hidden about a five minute's walk in the bush behind it. He got me all hyped up while the snow was on the ground about the garnet and beryl that could supposedly be found there.

Finally I got the chance to spend a weekend at the cabin, and wouldn't you know it, we found some after all! In my head of course I was expecting huge fancy crystals, even though he'd warned me the quarries were quite picked over already. I'm just happy we found any at all!

Funnily enough we were all sitting outside afterwards having a barbecue, when we noticed that the stone chimney had bigger garnets all over the thing than any we'd found, and we just never noticed in the many years we'd been there.

This uncle was given the rock about 10 years ago and recently gave it to my co-worker who brought it into the office.  

We are both student interns at the USGS so we figured we could easily have it identified.  That doesn't appear to be the case.  It has stumped every one we have talked to.  We had it send to the Smithsonian for some analysis, while informative, still has everyone stumped.  We sent some samples of it off to have thin sections made, still waiting on those.

Today I found a ton of cool stones left in one of our overgrown gardens. Looks like they have been here a long time, so they are probably from the original owner (all I know is that the original owners were elderly, and the guy had a boat). My guess is that they left them instead of moving them, and none of the other 3 owners noticed them (none of them ever touched the garden... so I am getting it into shape). 

It is a cool find... but it also feels like cheating. I just recently started rockhounding, and I find the hiking/hunting to be my favorite part. I am pretty good at identifying the local stuff, but most/all of these rocks are not from this area.

[These are the rocks I have found so far.](http://i.imgur.com/iqJ4j.jpg) Most likely there are more... some of which I will be able to find, some I wont.

 Anyway, I am studying geology and just got past my intro to geology class and am currently in a mineralogy class. I've found that I have difficulty identifying rocks because a lot of the characteristics of rocks seem up ambiguous at times. It seems like minerals that are just barely above a 7.5 can still be scratched by a knife but the knife takes damage as well. I never know how specific I need to be, if a streak is actually black or very dark grey, if something has perfect cleavage or nearly perfect cleavage. My biggest issue is probably with luster and deciding if something is glassy or pearly or silky. 

Will this stuff improve with time or are there any hints I can be given. I have done some Google searching but most every place I find is exactly like my text books, they give you the same information. 

Another way I might put this is that text books seem to treat geology in terms of black and white, rocks ARE this luster and have this cleavage while rocks in nature differ slightly.

Here's the [GRANITE](http://i.imgur.com/tJTGI.jpg) with some sort of green quartz vein running through it. In the middle of the vein was a fine silvery vein running from top to bottom (arsenopyrite?). Here is a [CLOSEUP](http://i.imgur.com/Tz4Ml.jpg) of the vein.

Here's some [TONOLITE?](http://i.imgur.com/6PTr2.jpg) with a bit of the granite in hand. I only found a bit of this around.

[THIS ONE](http://i.imgur.com/bH1ES.jpg) is pretty cool. There was an area on the wall which was different than the rest. There was some cool mineralization and fluorite, chalcopyrite, more silvery pyrite... the matrix was green in colour. I have no idea. Maybe you can explain to me what you see? :)

I also came across this strange [MINERAL](http://i.imgur.com/cG4Km.jpg). It is black to purple, and leaves what seems to me to be a purple streak. It was hard, but brittle enough that I could grind away at it with my fingernail. Some sort of hematite? 

I thought that it was that stuff that was giving the quartz the purple colour in the previous picture, until I came across this little guy. This has to be [FLUORITE](http://i.imgur.com/5COuQ.jpg), no?

1297395613.0	fj7tg	Thomas Creek, Oregon rockhounding trip report with pictures, 2/10/2011	tomkzinti	15	0	4	"Ok! Trip report! Today I went to [Scio, Oregon](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=scio,+or&amp;aq=&amp;sll=44.949898,-123.007701&amp;sspn=0.01101,0.032852&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Scio,+Linn,+Oregon&amp;ll=44.308127,-119.542236&amp;spn=5.699271,16.820068&amp;z=7) and followed a creek called Thomas Creek up as far as I could into the mountains to look for rocks.

Thomas Creek is famous for containing agates, jasper and petrified wood, especially the petrified wood. I've seen a multi-hundred-pound petrified stump come out of that creek IN TOWN, so yeah, there's potential there. I've also snorkeled in the creek in the same area as the stump was found and pulled out ten+ pounds of wood a day there, but I've never been to the headwaters of Thomas Creek to look for anything...so I figured it was a good idea to have a look.

My Ore-Rock-On DVD shows a place WAY up Thomas Creek where one can supposedly find opalized leaf fossil prints, agate and pet wood, so that was my aim for the day.

I tried looking for creek access points all along the way, but as it would figure, it's all riverfront property on that creek. No Trespassing signs were posted all over the place anywhere the road came close to the creek, and places where I could actually stop and take a look were all bedrock or rip-rap. No gravel. Lots of sand. -le sigh-

---

I stopped first in the town of Scio at a tiny city park along Thomas Creek and took a look at about 100 feet of scarcely-graveled riverbank. [Here's the haul](http://i.imgur.com/6selK.jpg): one yellow seam agate, a few pieces of really porous crap petrified wood and a few red jasper chunks. Also found one rusty old square nail (3"").

---

Second stop was at Shindler's Bridge Drive on Thomas Creek, east of Scio. Found some crap pieces of [pet wood and a few clear agates, one large red jasper.](http://i.imgur.com/u6ASv.jpg) Also found one small well-rounded rock with bits of quartz all over. Had to use a stick to pull pieces out of the creek. Lots of big river rock, very little good stuff on the banks. Almost everything I found came out of the water, and the water was still kind of high.

---

Third stop: [as far as I could go out Thomas Creek Road](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Scio,+OR+97374&amp;daddr=Thomas+Creek+Dr&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FUwkqgIdGHit-CnRgRaIFoq_VDGxYi9bp_OarA%3BFXBCqgIdpCCx-A&amp;mra=mift&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=16&amp;sll=44.712571,-122.609482&amp;sspn=0.011055,0.032852&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.71283,-122.610168&amp;spn=0.176885,0.525627&amp;z=12) along Thomas Creek. It's all riverfront property until the road turns to gravel, then another 500 feet further...and what do you know, [Weyerhauser's](http://i.imgur.com/60La2.jpg) actively logging and has [locked all the gates.](http://i.imgur.com/2AW2r.jpg) DAMMIT. Log trucks came through the [main gate](http://i.imgur.com/GxSoW.jpg) a few times while I was there and I could hear the horns of the logging equipment up the mountain from where I was, just like on Axe Men.

No opal leaf fossils for me. :(

[Looking upstream from the gated bridge](http://i.imgur.com/YAwPv.jpg)

[Looking downstream from the gated bridge](http://i.imgur.com/YAwPv.jpg)

There's good water flow (and that water was EFFING COLD), but I see gravel! On my side, even!

I parked by the main gate and [searched a good 1/4 mile](http://i.imgur.com/thN5w.jpg) down [one side of the riverbank](http://i.imgur.com/uRsI5.jpg) for three hours, came up with some good clear agates, some good jasper, a rock with some blebs of common (non-precious) opal in it, two pieces of common opal/agate and three pieces of carbonized wood. [Here's the haul.](http://i.imgur.com/zzxHA.jpg) There's ample evidence that the area upstream of the creek is fairly well mineralized, minus any granite or black sands in the creek. This is good to know, just for reference.

WTF? I guess the good pet wood just doesn't roll out of the ground and into the creek until further downstream. 

All in all it was a good, quiet day on the creek and I had a pretty good time seeing new places. I also had a good time making this post. :) Thanks for reading!"	t5_2rbfx	True

1366694094.0	1cx2mh	[ID Request] Heavy, black river rock from West Africa	tehsma	12	1	11	"This rock was given to my Mother by her West African friend, who referred to it as a ""Thunderstone"", and said it would protect her from being hit by lightening (lol). **It is very heavy for its size**, and Is apparently a river worn rock. Exact origin is unknown but she thinks it is from Zaire.

 Most obvious is alternating, fine layers which have a sinusoidal habit (one side has most layering). When tilted in the light, every other layer appears to shine brightly. It appears to be relatively fine grained, and contains what are apparently triangular &amp; other polygonal inclusions that break the layered pattern. A few of these inclusions appear to be tinted dark green (Olivine?) but it's hard to tell because it is set in a black rock. The areas that are not covered with the layers have a mottled appearance, with black alternating with light off-white areas.

When inspected with a hand magnifier, there appears to be quite a lot of gold flakes in the various boundaries between the layers.

My gut says this is a rock that has some sort of volcanic origin, perhaps an altered volcanic rock. Beyond that, I'm not sure. I included a series of Photos of the full rock, and also some macro shots which are extreme close ups of various parts, showing the apparent gold, the layering up close, and a few of the angular inclusions. 

Any help solving this mystery would be appreciated!

(I forgot to mention, all these rocks were found on the north shore of Lake Superior, MN near Duluth.)

[image album](http://imgur.com/a/hZx35)

Here are some hopefully adequate photos of recent finds. I hope someone can tell me more about these rocks; I'm unemployed and have an abundance of free time to look for rocks but not much ability to identify them.

#1 and #2 are strange agate examples. Is the white mineral chert? I've found dozens of agates around here, these stand out as unique.

#3 is very difficult to take photos of, for some reason. It is what I assume is basalt with... what is that??? Could it be thompsonite? My 8 year old nephew found it, and lost interest immediately, while I've remained stumped. I haven't seen anything around here before or since.

The last two photos are of the gigantic jasper I found, with an interesting white veined area. This whole rock is a lot larger than it looks, it's bigger than my head.

I also updated the original thread

-

So I cut, polished, and etched the second rock.

Interior matrix is far different than the iron slag rock.

Here are images of the various steps.

Please let me know what you experts think!

So what do you guys think? The second rock certainly has a more spectacular inner matrix - thanks again for everyone's time, effort, and knowledge!

I think I may have found an iron meteorite. I posted in /r/askscience and received a variety of responses, most with an air of healthy skepticism.

I have since cut a slice off of the rock, polished, and attempted to acid etch it to help me ID it. There is an absence of Widmanstatten patterns and Neumann Lines, but a faint crystalline pattern is still evident. (First time attempting any of this stuff so I'm sure my methods weren't as precise as they could have been.)

Before resigning to discouragement, I did some more research and discovered Ataxite meteorites, and more specifically **Chinga Ataxite**. I believe my specimen very much resembles the Chinga Ataxites.

I would greatly appreciate any help ID'ing this strange rock!

Thanks!

I've also recently started rock collecting/hounding, so I figure, why not combine the two? Anyway, here's my idea, let me know if it'd be useful to you or if something like this exists- 

Basically, it's an online catalog of your rock specimens - where you found them, photos, when you found them, whatever other notes you want to put on there. You can share this information and show off your collection, or choose to keep it private. In addition, locations would be connected to google maps, for a visual reference.

Eventually, the site would have a good inventory of good location to hound. You'd be able to search by area or mineral, so if you want to find a specific mineral or if you're new to an area, you know where to look.

I know some of the more interesting rocks can look less interesting when covered with dirt/sand is there any telltale signs like peculiar colors or shapes?

I would love to find an agate assuming they even exist in my area and I'm wondering if one needs to actually crack open the rock to tell if it's an agate? I imagine there's some agate identification guides somewhere out there I'll probably have to look into to.

I've included two photos of the greenish-blue stone, and the color is closer to blue than green. Any help in identifying these would make her extremely happy.

Thanks in advance!

Thanks everyone for the quick replies! Some additional info -

#3 is heavy and glassy - like black glass which reflects silver.
#4 started off as a round stone...my mom thinking it was possibly a geode asked my dad to split it. IT has a subtle purple hue which doesn't really come through in the photo.

He also sold the jars of opal chips (and other samples he collected) at rockhound meets. I have more jars, but they're packed away with other specimens I have no room to display.

Dan here with what should be the start of a series of responses to things you have asked to see!  


On show today are two minerals I collected, one from Franklin, NJ and the other from the Franklin marble quarry.  Here they are in [white light](http://imgur.com/a/JxNGc#0).  The first one is a rock I found partly by accident.  I have a habit of hitting rocks with my hammer.  There doesn't always need to be a reason for me to pop a rock, but sometimes that HULK SMASH feeling is just so satisfying(especially if I have the sledge).  This rock I happened to break and the insides looked different/weird so I put it in the bucket and moved along to other rocks.  It was only later when we checked out the rocks in the fluorescent shed that I could see just how weirdly if fluoresced. The rock is a specimen of calcite, willemite, sphalerite, and possibly dolomite.  What makes it weird is that they are mixed together in some places causing weird quenching of the fluorescence and odd color mixtures in other places.  This rock looks best in [short wave ultraviolet light](http://imgur.com/a/pBRuN#0).  I took the pictures for this album using my macro lens for a DSLR and tel me tell you that it was not easy, especially free-handing it in the dark with slower exposures for the fluorescence, but I enjoyed it a lot regardless!  I took the same rock and shot more of it in [Mid wave UV light](http://imgur.com/a/uBnRi), and [Long wave UV light](http://imgur.com/a/lVCnw).  In mid and long wave the rock doesn't look that great, in mid wave you can see the sphalerite fluorescing in blue/orange dots, but nothing spectacular, and in long wave the camera was picking up a red-ish light or tinge that I couldn't fix tinkering with the in-camera settings, but there was nothing worth seeing in long wave anyway.  


The next rock is probably one of my most uniquely shaped self-finds, an eye-shaped marble-fluorite-norbergite-diopside.  Think ancient Egyptian eyes.  I took photos again in [Short](http://imgur.com/a/R9B2T) [Mid](http://imgur.com/a/Uj1Ia) and [Long](http://imgur.com/a/zB76S) wavelengths.  If you go back to the whitelight photos, the fluorite is purple(non-fluorescing), norbergite is yellow(yellow fluorescing), and the diopside you can't really see well but it's a very very light blue in daylight(bright blue fluorescing).  


There's a lot more that could be said about both of these rocks, but this thread is getting long and I'll try to keep things short and readable!

""No, I mean the *metaphysical* properties of it.""

I just found this subreddit and I'm really excited about it. I've been into rocks to some degree for ages, and I never even thought to search for a related subreddit!

Anyhow, today I am here just to share some pictures from my first time tumbling. This is just after the first round, and they're back in for a second round with a less aggressive grit, so I'm really excited to see what comes up. 

I was kind of worried I would mess it up, since it was my first time and all, but so far I think it's going well. Some of them could have gone through a second round with the larger grit to shape them down a little more, but I am pleased with their shapes as they are (and out of starter grit packets...) so I am pressing on.

All of these are stones I have either found at my parent's farm (near a place known for it's agate and petrified wood pits), at a nearby lake, or at an amethyst mine from Thunder Bay.

Anyway, less talk, more picture!

[I think this one is smoky quartz](http://i230.photobucket.com/albums/ee183/Luinbariel/Rock%20Tumbling/SmokyQuartz.jpg)

I'm not sure on this last one. I found them in the hills of a very rocky area in Whiteshell Provincial Park in Manitoba. They were nestled in an out of the way crack, and had a very interesting grey/brown color to them. We knew the area had been once known for mining radioactive material, and it was the best guess I could come up with.

I also admire calcite's rhombohedral system and all the modified scalenohedral calcites. ;)

With so many to choose from, what's your favorite?"	t5_2rbfx	True
