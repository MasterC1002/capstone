I'd like to thank the people at SciFi, my all time favorite American TV station.  SciFi, you had the best original and syndicated programming around and you really knew your audience.  You found a niche, you did a great job, and things were good.

SyFy?  Well what can I say besides that our relationship has been abusive, deceptive, miserable, and all around a fucking horrible experience.  Thanks for cancelling, mothballing, and ruining the only things I liked on television.  Thanks for taking a small  but popular channel full of things that your core audience loved and removing them from your programming.  Thanks for changing out  Stargate for WWE.  There is nothing that gets my science fiction juices flowing like a bunch of roided-up men in tights touching each other...that was just great.  Thanks for showing Ghost Hunters 4 hours a day - that show is fucking awesome and so much better written then the crap from Roddenberry, Whedon, Rob Cooper and Brad Wright, or any of other myriad of talented people you ignore.  Thanks for showing Scare Tactics instead of ... I hate you.  Oh and Ghost Hunters International?  Really...really?  Cause um, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for making it impossible to catch an episode of your show online until it is 5 weeks old.  Have you heard of Hulu?  Google it.  

I can't wait until you are the CW of television...who am I kidding, at least CW came from UPN who ran Star Trek Voyager to an organized, and well planned 7 seasons.  You can't keep a show in the same fucking time slot for 5 weeks in a row.  

TL:DR -- Sci Fi thanks for the memories, SyFY - let me know when you have the estate sale.

1349025386.0	10ptfc	Dredd is performing poorly at the US box office. Take a chance, grab a few friends and go see it	co_fragment	1750	514	483	"If you're a Dredd fan of any kind, go see the movie. I went ready to be disappointed and left a happy fan.


If all you know of Judge Dredd as a character is the woeful Stallone movie, please do your best to forget it and go see this movie.


If you really don't know the character at all, this is the best introduction you'll ever need. Go see this movie.


If you don't want to watch it on blu-ray in six months and then come on this subreddit and moan that no-one told you of this movie, and how it sucks that they won't make any more because no-one went to see it. Then go see this movie.


The first thing I thought of as a comparison in comicbook movies are the Nolan 'Dark Knight' trilogy. It takes the Judge Dredd story and setting and tries to make it as much of a realistic 'take' as possible. While that means less spectacular settings, that didn't do the Stallone movie any good.

While there's all the usual nitpicking on various details from a fan POV, it gets everything pretty much right about the 'world' of Judge Dredd. The man himself is a complete stone-faced, bastard, bad-ass - Urban was a great choice. Judge Anderson gives a great counterpoint also.

The story is lean and mean, this isn't an origin story, just a day in the life of a Judge. That's not to say it's a dumb movie, but it's an action movie with some brains and heart to boot.

As it should be, it's pretty damn violent, with all the casual brutality of life in Mega City One. There's a lot of gore on show, a lot of it in glorious slow-mo.

I couldn't find it in 2D anywhere near me so I had to go 3D, which I'm glad of. The 3D actually added to the depth of the movie in lots of ways without being of the ""duck! Here comes an axe!"" school of 3D.
Is it perfect? No, there's a few things which I think could have been done better, but it's piddly shit really.

**EDIT - Wow, this blew up! Despite accusations of being a Lionsgate PR rep, corporate shill, Karl Urban's hairdresser, etc. I'm just someone who would simply just like to see some sequels.**

1324663788.0	no4yk	Hey Reddit, my novel is currently no. 1 in the Amazon Kindle Top 100 free sci-fi list. It's available for free to anyone from Amazon until midnight Christmas Eve. Enjoy :)	luciantv	1575	472	436	"**EDIT: Due to the fantastic response from Reddit, the book will stay free until after Christmas (at least two more days). Thanks again for your amazing comments and notes.**

Here's the link to the Amazon page where you can download the book for free. [The God in the Clear Rock](http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Rock-Ancients-Earth-ebook/dp/B004YF1D4E/ref=sr_1_132?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324651269&amp;sr=1-132)

It's more like a modern day Indiana Jones adventure than Dune. Here's the logline:

Mysterious artifact from lost ancient civilization of giants is somehow connected to series of deadly solar storms beginning to hit earth.

There's no strings attached. ~~Until tomorrow night at midnight~~ Until at least after Christmas, it is a completely free download from Amazon and you don't need a Kindle to read it. You can use any computer and anyone can download it. (Foreign countries might need to use the appropriate Amazon site instead of the above link - simply search for my name) This is my gift to Reddit. Merry Christmas :)

EDIT: Wow, what an amazing response from my fellow Redditors. I am grateful and humbled by the wonderful comments and replies. I'm going to try to get the publisher to keep the book for free until after Christmas (so you can tell all your friends to get a free copy). Thanks again Reddit. Have a great holiday :)

EDIT 2: This is just amazing. I wish I could keep typing, but it's getting late in Florida. For everyone who sent me an email address, I will get back to you I promise. It may take me a short while to sort through all of the PMs. Thanks again Reddit. Good Night :)

EDIT 3: Good Morning! Thanks to Reddit, my book is now number one in both the Amazon High-Tech and Adventure Top 100 lists and number 37 in the overall Kindle Top 100 free books. Have a great Christmas and I hope everyone who downloaded the book enjoys it. Reddit, you are the best :)

EDIT 4: I spoke to the publisher and it will remain free for next couple of days. Thanks for all of your great feedback. I am busy finishing the third book in the series now. It should be available in about 90 days. 

**Please feel free to share the link with anyone that wants a free book :)**"	t5_2qh2z	True

1303712291.0	gwtio	Regarding the accuracy of Stormtroopers.	xaxers	1040	372	352	"Stormtrooper accuracy is something of a joke on the internet.  They never seem to hit any important person when they shoot at them, missing constantly.  There's a Cracked article on it, for god's sake.  Everyone has heard the joke.

It's a complete and total lie, and it ignores the relevant details of the events.

To prove that they are, in fact, crack shots, watch the opening sequence in A New Hope.  Here we have a number of stormtroopers charging into a narrow breach into heavy fire, yet they are able to gun down more rebel soldiers in cover than they take in casualties!  This is not amateur night here--this is stone cold killers, destroying their foes mercilessly.  They are so effective that the defenders fall back almost immediately.

Then, the next time their accuracy is mentioned, it is in the examination of the corpses of a bunch of child-sized aliens.  That's right, they were able to kill a number of small targets with expert precision.  Now, it was off-screen, but you cannot get that kind of consistency and precision randomly.  It beggars the imagination to think that their aim is terrible.

So why can they never hit Luke and Leia in the Death Star?  They were ordered *not to*.   The escape was allowed--recall that Tarkin and Vader discussed *exactly that* the minute the Falcon left.  They needed the princess to go to the hidden fortress so they could track them there.  She already had refused to give them accurate coordinates, even as her homeworld was destroyed before her eyes.  She would never break, never talk.  So she had to escape.

Now, killing the one guy escorting her to the ship, or any of the vital crew to the small craft, would be counter-productive to that enterprise.  But, they have to make it look good.  The escape triggered an alarm.  Even if it hadn't (highly unlikely--they command was far too competent at their jobs to let anything slip through), Vader knew that an escape was on--he felt the presence of Obi-wan.  Vader is quite competent, and so would have certainly alerted command to this.  After all, he did have a discussion about it with Tarkin before seeking out Obi-wan. 

The only reasonable conclusion then is that the stormtroopers, fanatically loyal and dedicated to the cause, were ordered to attack *but miss* when doggedly pursuing these escaping prisoners.  And, miss by a small enough margin that it looks good.  Recall the bridge scene--blaster fire was erupting around the edges of the doorframe that they were standing on--inches from serious harm.  Yet, despite that large volume of fire, in single-shot mode, no hits were scored.  And well it was that none did!  Had a single shot hit the princess, it could have killed her.  It could have wounded her severely enough that escaping with her would have been implausible, and they would have instantly been alerted to the fact that it was a set-up.

It nearly was--Leia thought it too easy.  However, any hit would have made it obvious if they *did* escape, since even if it wasn't lethal, it would have dramatically slowed the party down, destroying any illusion.

As such, from A New Hope, all evidence is that they are, in fact, excellent shots and quite loyal, willing to die for the cause without a moment's hesitation on the order of Lord Vader.

One could argue, terribly, that it is simply the quality of the weapon that is a problem.  That is patently absurd.  The Empire has the resources to build a space station the size of a small moon *without being noticed*.  It wasn't public knowledge that the Death Star was built--it came from nowhere and blew up a planet.  No one believed that possible until it happened, which was the point.

This means that they have a logistical train that routinely delivers massive amounts of material across the galaxy, such that it draws little real attention.  This cannot be cheap--the cost of transport alone would be immense.  But they are somehow buying weapons on the cheap?  That makes no sense.  They'd make sure that these things were very accurate, and consistent, before the purchase of every lot.  Their quartermaster corps would see to that, and they must be sufficiently competent to do so because they were able to build a moon in secret.  That's no mean task.  So their weapons must be accurate.

Ignoring that, it still remains the fact that recently looted weapons, from the very racks that these stormtroopers drew from, were quite accurate in the hands of other people who just picked them up and had not drilled extensively on them.  These must be accurate weapons indeed, or the Hand of God Himself intervenes upon every shot ensuring the safety of the heroes and the death of the villains.


Now, consider Empire Strikes Back.  We see very little of the battle of Hoth, but we do see them rapidly assembling a heavy weapon even as they take automatic weapon fire, without a moment's hesitation.  That requires immense discipline and skill.  This goes, again, to demonstrating their intense competency.  You do not acquire such coolness under fire without intense and rigorous training.  Are we then to believe that they train to just set weapons up, but not fire them accurately?  Please.

So, on Cloud City, we again see a large contingent of stormtroopers not hitting the escaping princess and retinue.  Again, this is *clearly by design*.  Darth Vader had the hyperdrive disabled--he asked his subordinates this on his command ship.  They weren't going anywhere.

However, he needed a back-up plan.  They weren't going to leave without Luke, and he wanted his son captured.  So he again ordered them to be allowed to escape, but to make it look good.  They weren't going anywhere anyhow--they'd just be going straight into the shuttle bay of a Star Destroyer, unable to jump to hyperspace.  He knew that Luke had been developing his skills, so it is not unreasonable to assume that he could send a message via the force to effect an extraction.  Luke could flee, and Luke is certainly clever and skilled enough to find a way past guards--or at least, past enough that he could get out.  Then, the Falcon would ""rescue"" him, leave atmosphere, and promptly be captured, leaving Luke firmly in the hands of Vader.

Lobot being able to lead a security detail *anywhere*?  That's either a gross oversight, one that is unbelievable given that Vader himself ordered the Falcon to be disabled, or deliberate.  He knew Calrissian would attempt to break the Princess and Chewie out--why do you think he kept altering the deal, pushing it well beyond the boundaries that Lando would accept?  Did he think that Lando would simply go along with this, without resisting?  Surely not.

This leaves the final movie, Return of the Jedi.  Again, we see nothing but extreme competency and accuracy on the part of the stormtroopers in battle.

During the battle, we never see the results of their pot-shots against rebels or Ewoks, but we do see them laying down a consistent volley of fire, with disciplined shots, and constant ducking back to cover.  One could argue this would mean inaccurate shots, but given the first movie's opening sequence, that is hard to believe.  They were using the sights to aim, instead of firing from the hip, during this fight and on the ship combat, they did not bother aiming carefully.  It's hard to believe they lose any accuracy at all when using a more carefully aimed approach.

So what direct evidence do we have of their shooting?  When Han and Leia are attempting to break into the bunker, two successive pot-shots hit a child-sized object behind partial cover, instant disabling the droid, and inflicting a potentially serious wound on Leia.  Again, these were shots taken under hasty aim against targets behind cover, while shots were going towards them.  This is not an easy thing--ask an infantryman if you disbelieve me.

The evidence is clear--Stormtroopers are quite accurate and effective soldiers, with top of the line equipment.  Claiming otherwise is slander."	t5_2qh2z	True

1254989278.0	9ryys	Star Wars wasn't about the fall and redemption of Anakin, or even the super-spy exploits of R2-D2.  It's really about one man, who inadvertently made of mess of everything.	parallax7d	849	258	375	"The Star Wars double triology is actually a cautionary tale, a warning to all.  It's a story that shows the long term consequences, the 'blow back', the repercussions of acting headstrong and without insight.  It's the story of a single man who's brave and selfless actions ultimately were all in vain.  This epic tragedy takes decades to unfold, so everyone can plainly see the horrendous results of this one man's actions.  This is the story of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The one who peed in the pool.  The one who ruined it for everyone.  The galaxy would never be the same, the naive actions of one doomed them all.

Let's start with Episode I.  Obi-Wan gets owned by a kick to the chest from Darth Maul.  Didn't see that one coming Obi?  Great, now your master is dead.

Obi Wan insisted on training Anakin.  He disregarded instruction of far wiser Jedi in order to satisfy his own sense of honor, or was it guilt over the death of his master?  With Yoda, Obi-Wan dismisses the most critical resource the entire universe has to offer him: the ability to peer into the future.  Yoda's warning of ""grave danger"" apparently means nothing in the face of Obi-Wan's sense of self honor.  

""I have a bad feeling about this.""

Obi-Wan trains the boy, yet is unable to keep him in check.  Obi-Wan lacks the compassion, fidelity and consistency needed to successfully rear a headstrong, energetic youth.  Obi ends up being almost abusively harsh to the boy.  This essentially sets the pattern for Anakin's relationship with authority.  He doesn't respect it, he wants to be cut loose.  Anakin seriously lacks independent self control.

The boy goes dark side.  Obi-Wan tries to cut his losses (literally!) but even fumbles that.  Anakin's baby mama dies.  Now it's on.  The boy didn't want to kill you, but now you've forced his hand.  He will now destroy everything you stand for, with the sort of mechanical efficiency only a force-infused, jedi trained, utterly betrayed, psychopathic, cyborg-with-a-laser-sword can.  Everyone dies. 

Fast forward 20 years.  Obi-Wan runs into Luke being pwned by sand-folk.  He unwittingly gets the message that the empire has captured Princess Leia, and has it's vice grips around the rebel alliance.  Great, Obi-Wan has been sitting around the desert for 2 decades smoking doobies while the last vestiges of the rebellion are inevitably crushed.  It's a good thing you live so close to the boy, so you can not train him.  Let's go to the Death Star now.

Obi-Wan decides to take 3 out of the 4 most important people in the rebellion straight to hell.  Let's visit Leia (a force-less and unimportant girl who gets her planet blown up) on the Death Trap, err.. Star.  He then decides to run off by himself while Luke and co run around aimlessly, into masses of armed baddies.

On the Death Star, laser-swording it up with his old robo-sith buddy, Obi-Wan does the best thing he ever did his entire life, he dies.  This is a boon for all that is good in the world.  At this exact moment the scourge of Obi-Wan is over, and the galaxy begins to heal itself.  From this point forward things start to get better.  

Out of guilt Obi-Wan decides to haunt Luke.  Every five minutes Obi-Wan's ghost voice has to butt in and be all like ""Luke, run"" and ""Luke, the force is with you"", and ""Luke, you didn't finish your corn flakes"".  Luke doesn't know if he's going crazy, so he brushes this aside temporarily so he can blow up the Death Star with a proton torpedo.

The Empire Strikes Back, Luke is lost.  Obi-Wan lets him nearly die, but at the last minute puts down his doobie and tells Luke to go to Dagobah so Yoda can do what he himself should have done in the first place.  Luke survives inside the smelly guts of a tauntaun, the rebel base is destroyed (thanks for the heads up on that by the way, Obi-Wan!), and Luke goes off to Dagobah to be trained by a green muppet cripple, who's brain is raddled by old age yet is still 1,000x better equipped to train the boy than Obi-Wan.  And he does it on a deadline.

Luke saves the rebels, saves his father (who almost turns him to the dark side cause Obi-Wan couldn't deal with sitting Luke down for five minutes and leveling with the boy about what really happened to his father), topples the empire, and all is now right in the world.


At the end of Return of the Jedi, the rebels throw a huge party to celebrate their epic victory.  It's been a decades long struggle, and they deserve to unwind.  Luke is the star, but of course Obi-Wan's ghost has to appear for the first time, just so he can gloat over the good job he did.

Sure, John Carpenter has made some pretty horrible movies in his time. But I recommend this film to anyone who says he is a horrible director. This movie is his masterpiece! 

It has some of the absolute best special effects! Not only for its time, but also compared to today. Its own prequel can't even compare with all of its CGI effects! The movie is perfectly paced as well. It scares you right when it must, and does so in such an unsettling way.

Also, it has Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley. Yep, he's going to give you the diabetes!

[EDIT#1]
A lot of people mistake the newest edition of the film for being a remake. Chronologically it's not. It's supposed to be a prequel. However, it might as well be a remake since all the same character types exist. There's even the hard-ass fly-boy American character in both films. They just added a woman in the newest one. Why make them so similar? Shitty writers.

What level of bigotry would make me feel differently about supporting a person's works?	gotoreddit	908	325	620	"First off, I am *greatly* looking forward to the Ender's Game movie. The stills and trailers released so far look visually amazing. For me, personally, what critically captured my imagination in the novel, which I read as an adult, was the school, Ender's leadership, and the zero-g training room battles. I want to see the battles with spectacular visual detail. If they get that right, and show lots of it, I'll be happy.

With regard to Card's politics, while I tacitly support gay rights, I have never directly involved myself in the issue. I have tended, in fact, to agree with people suggesting that Card's viewpoints should not impact decisions about his books or the movie.  After all, nearly everyone is going to have some ""political"" view that I don't agree with.

*But then I had a thought: What if Card was a self proclaimed Nazi? Is my rather indifferent feelings about him influenced by my less than passionate feelings about gay rights? What level of bigotry does it take for me to inconvenience myself?*

Although it is an uncomfortable thought that I didn't enjoy, it has changed my perspective. Paraphrasing another redditor: We don't call bigotry a ""political"" view when it is based on skin color. We call that racism. Bigotry based on sexual orientation should not be dismissed simply as ""politics"".

If Card simply held his opinions privately, and didn't spend his money and use his platform to promote them, I wouldn't care. But when someone starts actively working to suppress the rights of others, it becomes an altogether different issue.

Personally, I don't think anyone is doing ""bad"" by buying his books or seeing the movie. It is impossible for people to pay attention to the viewpoints of everyone involved in the entertainment they enjoy. I also don't think his viewpoints should influence the level of enjoyment to be had from what he creates. However, at the same time, I think it *is* doing ""good"" to boycott Card and his works, if you can. While I will most likely see the movie, I am also going to be a hypocrite. I will not praise it; I will not promote it; I will try to discourage anyone that isn't dying to see it from seeing it; And I will praise those that speak against it.

And perhaps, to salve my guilt, I'll be a little less tacit and a little more active in my support for gay rights.

*tl;dr:* I'm a hypocrite. Don't see the movie, m'kay... unless you really want to."	t5_2qh2z	True

For years, I've heard this complaint about Sunshine: ""Oh it's really good, but the ending sucks.""

I watched the movie tonight for the first time, and I'm sorry to say, but everyone who says that is wrong. ""Sunshine"" is a science-fiction movie that deserves to be featured in the halls of film history with classics like ""2001.""

I'm guessing that people don't like that the burned man stays alive a credibility-straining long time on the derelict ship, only to reappear to stop the second mission.

The problem is, that's too literal of a reading.

The burned man is not a plot device meant to inject artificial suspense. The burned man is a metaphor.

The burned man represents religion rising up out of the darkness of our past. His goal: to stop science from illuminating all of humankind.

The entire movie is the story of science triumphing over the insanity of religion. Religion that burns its own people alive, like witches at the stake. Religion that lives on, and on, and on - almost longer than can be believed. Religion that distorts reality and clouds the mind with fear. Religion that does not create life, but can only take it away. And religion, or superstition, whose power grows in proportion to the power of science.

Just at the moment where humankind thought it was free of religion, free to make its own destiny, religion returns in fury.  And ultimately, even though religion follows us all the way to the edge of space and time, we don't destroy it. 

We only break free of its grasp.

The entire movie is a metaphor, wrapped in a gripping suspense plot, filled with stellar, organic acting performances from an all-quality cast, painted with outstanding cinematography &amp; VFX, and touched off with brilliant visual homages to science fiction's storied past. 

""Sunshine"" is an absolutely A+ film. It is the sort of science fiction we should all be clamoring for in the theaters. And it's been dismissed so many times.

The ending doesn't suck. The ending is the point of the whole movie.

Surprisingly it is much more reverent to the material than the actual prequels.	megatom0	829	315	194	I'm not kidding when I say that I enjoyed this as parody film. I could tell whoever wrote it was a fan of Star Wars as there were many jokes that referenced some of the minutia and details of the series such as Ilumian Crystals and Holocrons. It even touched on a lot of extended universe stuff for jokes, including a Thrawn joke. As far as a porn it wasn't that great, until the Chewie sex scene where he fucks Eve Laurence as a Storm Trooper, which to me is the epic center piece of the movie. There is of course tons of incest with Vader fucking Leia, Luke gang banging Leia with Solo. You know all the stuff you've thought of for years. Also surprisingly decent CGI, not great for the animated characters but the space battles looked alright. All in all it was better than the prequels.	t5_2qh2z	True

Are there any other ""first encounter"" type novels you guys might recommend? Also - discussion of Childhood's End is welcome!

**EDIT**: WOW - I'm really surprised (and grateful) for all the responses. I've definitely got a lot here that I plan on checking out. Chief among them: 

* Gateway - Frederick Pohl
* The Mote in God's Eye - Niven and Pournell
* The Sparrow - Mary Doria Russell (this one definitely caught my eye after reading a brief spoiler-free synopsis)
* Contact - Sagan
* The Ring Of Charon - Roger Allen 
* The City and the Stars - Arthur C Clarke

Homer answers he ""was just thinking"" 
""That would be a first"" says the goodie-two-shoes employee.
Homer is then sent to check out an over heating pipe , only to find an alien organism nesting in the warm embrace of the power plant.

[Star Wars fan survey](http://misterflibble.polldaddy.com/s/star-wars-fans)

[Star Trek fan survey](http://misterflibble.polldaddy.com/s/star-trek-fans)


I've not set a close date for these yet because I don't know how many people will be willing to participate, but I surely do appreciate those who do!

I'll try x-posting this in /r/StarWars and /r/startrek as well.

Thanks again for your help!

-----

**Edit**:  I was planing on keeping the survey open until August, but since there was so much participation, I may close it after only one week.  I'll write up a report of some kind, though I don't really have a blog or anything to post it on.

* Yes, I am aware the Trek survey is missing the 2009 film in the rating question.  This was because the free version of the site only permits up to 10 options in one question and 10 questions per survey and I simply ran out of spots to put it.  This also means that a lot of questions you would have liked to have been asked weren't in the survey.  I would like to make a longer survey someday.  Someone suggested Google, so I might try that -- or someone else can.

* The questions about Han vs Greedo and Picard vs Kirk are meant to be light-hearted.  Something something jimmies rustled and a u mad.


* The point of these surveys wasn't to come up with a way to decide which was better, nor was it any kind of competition between the two franchises.


This survey was put together, inspired by some banter between me and a friend.  We both made some generalizations about Star Wars fans and Star Trek fans in our discussion.  There were some ""educated"" guesses made on both sides in our debate, and I wanted some statistical data to see which one of us was right or wrong and on which points.


The results are turning out to be interesting.  Some of my assumptions were spot on and others were way off.  So, when I do get around to reporting results, I'll let you know what my predictions were.  Those of you who took this way more seriously than I expected can rofl in my face about how much of a dumbass I was on the hypotheses I got wrong!

-----
**Edit 2**:  The votes have slowed down a lot over the past couple days and you lot seem a bit anxious for results, so I closed the survey as of earthdate 6/27/12.  I'm 3/4 the way through building a workbook with all the data (I can only export if I pay).   Once I get it all together, I'll see about hosting the workbook on Google docs.    Qapla'!

**Edit 3**:  [Here are the data results!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJyJIdXgQ8tdHRPNmh1R2s5VENHaFpwUWFDS1NIcWc)  Much of the color formatting wouldn't transfer on to Google, so you'll have to deal with the blandness of the presentation.  Sorry!  I hope many will find the results interesting. "	t5_2qh2z	True
1374865348.0	1j44li	Battlestar Galactica + Road Trip	Archimedes416	525	121	90	"TL/DR: Went on road trip, wanted BSG tattoo, discover random tattoo artist obsessed with the show.
Here are pics: http://imgur.com/a/lLe6s

A couple Summers ago I decided on a whim to drive across the United States, just me and my hedgehog at the time. I also decided that at some point during my journey I'd get Starbuck's winged tattoo as a sort of souvenir. I had been wanting it for awhile, and this adventure seemed to be a good time to do it.

On my trip, I started entering ""Tattoo"" into my GPS to see what would pop up. Most of the time, a shop I found wouldn't be open at the time I'm passing through, other times the phone number wouldn't work, and one time the GPS led me to a location where a shop didn't even exist! Finally, as I'm traveling through Indiana, I get a hold of a guy who says he has an opening that very day about an hour away from where I am. Perfect. He asks me what I want and I ask him if he's familiar with Battlestar Galactica. I hear silence and then ""Are you kidding me... I LOVE BSG!""

I get to the shop, lo and behold, this one tattoo artist I make contact with throughout the entire US happens to own thousands of dollars worth of props from the show! My tat took about 4 hours... I spent a total of 9 hours with this guy chatting about life, meeting his family, and going from complete strangers to friends. One of the coolest moments of my life...

Edit: He also had dog tags, as well as the first cylon war painting that can be seen hung up in Admiral Adama's office.
