YET the others started teasing me and telling me to ""put those things away"" or ""don't wear something so revealing"". When I pointed out that the other girl was wearing something much lower, they replied, ""Well since she has small boobs, it's ok for her to wear something so low cut. But it's not ok with you."" I was completely outraged by this! Just because you have big or small boobs doesn't mean you have to show them off or keep them hidden.

So the clerk is trying to fit my daughter, who by her measurements ought to be in a 28DD. First suit is way too loose in the ribcage, so they give her another to try. She says, ""um, this one doesn't fit either. ""

""Ohhh, let us see. I bet it looks great! ""

She shows them. Reaction? ""Look at that, you've got cleavage! It looks great! ""

Her response : ""It's denting me in on top. That's not cleavage, it's quadboob.""

This visit the consultant measured me and told me that honestly to get my perfect bra I was not going to find it in this store. She tried putting me in a 34 DDD and a 36 DDD because she told me if I was really wanting a bra from there those were my best options. In the end she was totally honest and told me that my real size is 32 F and even gave me a list of specialty stores to try out, as she would rather have me in a bra that fits properly.

For some context, we have a small menu that our guests can choose from which is predominantly hot food. 

We had run out of eggs, and as they were being cooked on the barbeque outside, I went outside, down the three steps to see if they were ready. Most were, so I grabbed the tray with the cooked eggs and ran back up the stairs. On the last step, there's a small sill for the sliding door, and my foot got caught on it which, obviously, pitched me forward and I stacked it in front of the entire brunch crowd of 25 people, tray of eggs still in hand. 

I managed to save the eggs, but I tripped boobs first into the floor, and I bounced. I. Bounced. Off. The. Floor. My boobs acted as shock absorbers, and I was absolutely fine. No pain, nothing. 

I really shouldn't have been running, paticuarly up stairs, because when I run up stairs, I usually fall over. I just... I can't believe that it actually happened. I think I'm still in a bit of shock.

I developed young and fast, so I was a D cup by the time I was 10. Usually when I got teased it rolled off me pretty easy but I remember there was this one day when I was feeling sensitive or it was just too much for whatever reason and I went home in tears. My mother wasn't home so it fell upon my father to try and ""fix"" it (his response to tears). I didn't want to tell him what was going on because it was about my boobs but he couldn't stand that I was upset and not letting him help. I finally break down and tell him that I'm being teased about the size of my breasts. 


My father huffs and puffs a little while processing this information. He then takes me in his arms and says ""Here's what you do.

1371860866.0	1gtvgk	Real friends don't make you feel bad for having large breasts.	CrysDawn	151	15	64	"I just needed to vent for a minute.  I posted a series of photos on Facebook yesterday, because I took my dachshund to the Vet and he was being cute trying to hide by crawling up my shirt and hiding behind me.  I posted two photos of him doing so, and then one of all the hair he left on the front of my shirt. Granted, most of the picture was breasts, but they were FULLY covered and the photo was far from lewd.

I expected a few jokes or quips about the breasts, but I was really unprepared for one of my friends - a generally nice guy - to pretty much attack me for posting the photo.  I'm not a regular attention-seeking poster of photos, no duckfaces, no constant changes of self-taken photos in different angles showing my cleavage or anything else.  But, I cannot help that I have large breasts.  I cannot help that they stick out in most photos and are more noticeable than anything else.  My feelings are just really hurt.  If someone with a smaller chest posted those photos, it would just be - ""ah, cute puppy"" and ""haha, girl with a hairy chest!"" comments.  Instead, it was belittling and mean.  And it sucks even more that it was done by someone who is usually really nice.

Of course, once I made the comment that I can't help that I have big breasts, instead of apologizing, he just made a joke about that too (typical, ""Oh the poor well endowed girl has it so rough"" BS).  I'm really angry.  Instead of posting a passive aggressive statement, I figured I'd just vent to people who understand.  So, thanks for letting me.  :/ "	t5_2ubfr	True

She is 5'9"" wears a size 12/14 ish and is probably realistically a 34C or D maybe. (I washed her clothes for her and her bra was a 38B. WHAAATT?)  I tried to size her and she refused. She just kept saying that she had given up bras. They were stupid and the straps never stayed up. She had only the one with her and I saw her wear it once for nipple coverage. She is shallow, firm and has PC so her sternum pokes way out. Her whole vacation here was spent in the CUTEST selection of sundresses...braless. One right after the other....adorable strappy and strapless ones. Casual and cute!

I'm all kinda opposite of her. I'm shorter...5'4"" an hourglass... size 12/14 with 34Gs. I literally cant go without a bra under anything. My boobs are soft and pendulous and heavy. They hang low... near my waist. I'm a big waistless bloob without a bra. Anyway....the whole time she was here she was on a crusade to get me to go bra-less. She kept trying to convince me to buy sundresses and just do it. She kept saying nobody would notice or care. Its natural etc. I just kept refusing...I cannot go bra-less under clothes...I just can't....
Sigh....anyway the last day she was here I went out to the kitchen bra-less with my pjs on...to grab some coffee. I had on pj pants and a tshirt. 

She took one look at me and said,"" OMG,WOW! I didn't know it was that BAD! You shouldn't ever go braless! That looks terrible!""

I glared back at her...gave the obligatory,"" I told you so!"" and retreated to my room to put on a bra. 
Sad part? I really wanted to believe her and believe I could go bra-less like her in cute sundresses....but the truth is...never in my life have I worn a dress without a bra. Never in my life have I worn a strapless anything. Never in my life has a spaghetti strap dress worked for me. Never. I've always wanted them too....I think I have smaller boob envy!"	t5_2ubfr	True

Anyway, I cut all those foods out of my diet and have been feeling really great, but I thought it couldn't hurt to have a second opinion from someone with their degree in medicine. More specifically, I went to see a nutritionist.

After the usual spiel about eating three meals a day along with snacks, she asked me about my exercise routine. I admitted that I am pretty sedentary aside from the daily activities associated with being a college student. I told her that I used to love swimming laps, but can no longer do so due to having tubes in my ears for almost four years. Without skipping a beat, she looks me dead in the eye and says that I should start jump roping 500 steps every morning, because that's what she does to stay in shape and she loves it.

In a split second I glanced at my (usually 30FF, but I was currently wearing a 30G Freya) chest, then back at her (estimated 28B or 26C) chest and chuckled silently in my head. Yeah, I'll get riiiiiiight on that..."	t5_2ubfr	True

http://imagethumbnails.milo.com/033/938/010/trimmed/33938667_34028010_trimmed.jpg

That's the shirt^ adorable, right? Anyway, with my BBPs and all, I opted to wear a bandeau underneath to assure there wouldn't be any wardrobe malfunctions. I still did have some cleavage going on, but nothing disturbing, (I'm a classy teen.) Anyway, as I was paying for my ticket, this happened:

Less endowed older girl who I've never met- ""Your bra is showing""

Me- ""Oh, no that's just my bandeau.""

Suddenly in front of about 10 other students SHE STANDS THE FUCK UP AND REACHES INSIDE OF MY SHIRT AND TRIED TO BRING MY BANDEAU UP.

Now the way I have my boobs straddled in there is very intricate and well thought out, so when she tries to do this, she realizes my breasts were not about to budge. So suddenly she takes her hand out of my shirt, points to my bra strap and says, ""see, your bra is showing."" 
It was at that point i shook my head and walked away.

EXCUSE ME FOR HAVING SLIGHTLY LARGE BOOBS.
EXCUSE ME FOR NOT BEING CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO WEAR A STRAPLESS BRA.

1355045389.0	14jjeo	My boobs are so offensive, work is requiring me to wear a uniform.	mdc1307	126	19	99	"This is somewhat a rant/wtf/advice...
I am a bartender at a VFW, which is a bar for veterans that served in a foreign war, in a war zone. Mainly a place for older guys (55+) to go and drink beer and gamble their lives away. When I was hired, I specifically asked my boss if there was a uniform/dress code. He said no, but they would get me a couple of button-up shirts(BBP by itself) just in case I wanted to wear them. 

Fast forward a few months. Still no shirts given to me, but there was a complaint. I was wearing a tank top because it was burning up behind the bar. Said tank top showed no cleavage...until I had to wash dishes. One of the patrons was sitting right in front of the sinks, which are set low, with his wife. Lo and behold, the next day I was informed I would have to start wearing the uniform that I never received. The members voted on this and everything. A meeting about my boobs.

It is now a few months past this event, and I still have no uniform. Every time I wear a form fitting shirt, I am reminded by one patron or another that they have to order me some shirts. Most days, I wear a jacket or sweater just to avoid the comments.

Part of me wants to look at whoever says something about the uniform, and say ""Hey, I have big tits. Get over it."" However, I would like to keep my job. I am trying to think of some passive-aggressive modifications to make to my uniform. Here are a few thoughts:
1. Altering the shirt to be extremely figure flattering and missing the top three buttons or so.
2. Extremely bright colors/tie-dyed. 
3. Clever pun/symbol on the back

TL;DR : The awesomeness of my boobs led to the requirement that I wear a uniform at work. "	t5_2ubfr	True
1354730122.0	14bz9s	Dear Breasts, we really need to work on our communication [half-sarcastic rant]	kmhazz	129	21	15	"Dear Breasts,

As you are aware, winter has started where we live. You were shivering nonstop back in the beginning of November when it started getting cold (as was most of the rest of our body, for that matter), and our old winter coat was too worn out to continue wearing.

As you know, I've been pampering you lately with new and better-fitting bras, which I know you appreciate. I bit the bullet and bought a new coat so we could all be warm together.

I realize that you didn't like the coat that much. You were squished a little bit if I zipped it all the way up, and I understand that this wasn't the most comfortable for you.

However, you must understand that it was the cutest thing I could find that would fit all of us, and with how much preferential treatment I've been giving you lately, I needed to balance your needs with the rest of our body, and I was really hoping you'd take one for the team and deal with it for the sake of everyone else.

Maybe you don't realize it, but those bras I have been buying you lately are the most expensive articles of clothing I own besides my former prom dress and the three-piece suit I used to wear for that old job. Actually, that bra you have on right now? The retail price of that thing is more than everything else I am wearing right now *combined*.

It's for these reasons that I do not understand why, on today of all days (when it is sub-zero and snowing out there) you will not let me zip the coat up without choking myself. I don't think it is fair to the rest of us to have to freeze because you want to through a hissy fit about being squeezed a bit.

Please consider changing your behavior immediately. You know I don't want to get rid of you, but you also know that, if I did want to, I can.

Sincerely yours,

I've been wearing a 36C since my freshman year in high school because my mom was convinced that ""Your breasts don't look that big, and I don't want you in a bigger cup because I don't think you'll fill it so you need to go up a band size.""

And I just sort of accepted it because she pays for my clothes and at least they sort of fit. But then I started having HORRIBLE back pain and we couldn't figure out why and I ended up on this subreddit. So I went to Nordstrom myself, got measured, and it turns out that my underbust is 33 inches which means I'm not even close to a 36. And my cup size is an E. 36C and 34E are NOT sister sizes.

I ended up buying a couple 34Es at Bloomingdale's that were on sale and were super comfortable. I've been in the right size bra for like two weeks and I have almost no back pain. But now my mom doesn't believe that I'm actually that size, because she doesn't understand that cup sizes differ based on the band size. She's convinced because she wears a 40D that I can't be a D or bigger than a D because I have less breast tissue than her. So she wants me to return the amazing bras that have reduced my back pain and buy 38Cs. 

Note: I'm 5'2"" and I weigh 118 pounds.

I even showed her the difference between the way the 36Cs were fitting and the way a 34E fits - I have none of that underarm ""fat"" that's really just breast tissue with nowhere to go, the straps aren't holding them up anymore because the band is doing its job, I'm filling up the cup without spilling over anywhere, and the gore lies flat. 

She still insists that I'm in the wrong size and that going up a band size will be a better fit. So I'm frustrated.

This all came about because one morning my husband was getting ready for work and could not find his boots.  He has a men's size 12, these are not small boots.  We looked everywhere and were baffled.  Finally, after about 15 minutes I glace over by the bed and see my bra on the floor.  I know the risks involved with it being on the floor, broken underwires are the worst.  So I pick it up, and there were his boots! We seriously could not see them under the bra it was really embarrassing, but he found it really funny and loves to tell the story. 	t5_2ubfr	True

Yesterday I was playing with the dog in the park, and walk into a tree. Some how during the time I untangle myself and the dog I drop the leash. My dog runs off and I tried to chase her down. OHGODWHY.jpg My boobs where bouncing like bad checks. Anyways during my corgi chase I hit a kid in the face with my boobs (wasnt paying attention) and effectively tripping over him to land on my face. (My boobs acted as air bags so I only got scraped palms) After I collected my runaway corgi, I apologized to his mom so about a million times and promptly left. I called today to check on him and he is golden and wants to play with my dog.

First, some backstory: I stumbled upon this subreddit one day about a year ago when clicking the random subreddit button out of boredom. As someone who enjoys boobs, I started reading some of the posts and the links on the sidebar and learned a lot very quickly about the world of bra sizing. I read about the correct way to find a bra size and how hard it is to find bras above a DD cup in the U.S. I felt so bad knowing that so many women are in discomfort wearing the wrong bra size, but there was nothing really I could do about it. It’s not like I could just walk up to random women and tell them that they are probably wearing the wrong bra size.

A few months after I had stumbled on bigboobproblems, I started dating my wonderful girlfriend. She is short, curvy and very cute, and has fantastic boobs. On our first date I noticed that she had some quad-boob problems visible slightly through her tank top, and I restrained myself from making a comment or suggestion. For a few months I would occasionally browse bigboobproblems trying to find a story about a boyfriend or husband who brought up getting correctly fitted to their SO, but nothing ever really helped my situation. I knew she wasn’t wearing the right size, but how would I bring it up?

Eventually, as we became more open with each other, especially about sex, it finally felt like the right time to bring it up. I was scared that she would think it was weird that I knew so much about bras and bra sizing, but I felt I had to say something.  So, one day as we were texting back and forth about her getting lingerie for Valentines Day, I asked her what her bra size was so I could look for lingerie as well. I knew that she was probably wearing a 38DD or something close to that, so when she told me that she wore a 36DD I wasn’t that surprised. She said that most stores don’t even carry her size, let alone in any cute styles. She also mentioned that she was pretty sure she was wearing the wrong bra size as well, and that she probably needed to get a larger size. This was the perfect time for me to share my knowledge.

I told her that I knew a fair amount about bra sizing, and that she was more than likely wearing too large of a band and too small of a cup size, as many women are.

She was not weirded out at all, just a little shocked that I knew so much. She said she was aware there were sizes past DD, but thought the larger the bra, the less attractive it was. Shopping online for a bra did not appeal to her either. She was also appreciative of the fact that I know what the struggles are of having larger breasts. The next time we were together I showed her this subreddit and shared links with her on how to be fitted properly. A week or so later we got a measuring tape and I helped measure her using the guide in the side bar. It was a really fun experience and was very sexy. It helps that she has a positive image about her breasts. She ended up being a 34G, which was actually what I had guessed, funny enough.

We went to Nordstrom later that day to look at bras. The selection as far as colors and patterns wasn’t the greatest, but they did have her size in a variety of styles. The lady working there was very helpful, and re-measured her just to be safe. She came up with 34G as well, and had my girlfriend try on a lot of different bras. She ended up purchasing two bras that day, a black Freya Deco AA4234 plunge bra and a red Freya Honey Deco plunge bra. They both fit well and her posture has improved. Her boobs also look great, now that they are actually being supported. She was also excited to learn that there are bikinis and sports bras that will actually fit her boobs.

I really wanted to share my and my girlfriend’s story, and give hope to any guys who are reading and want to help their SO. The experience definitely brought us closer together, and I feel great knowing that she is more comfortable now. Plus, her boobs look better than ever, which is definitely a plus.

Blargh. Just because I got fitted correctly and it's a slightly unusual size doesn't mean that there's 'no chance' I'm the size I am. I'm actually thinking about trying a 32K as there is slight quadboobing in the 32JJ Curvy Kate Romance.

One was on Tumblr, when someone was critizing a [photoshopped picture](http://clementinecuties.tumblr.com/post/45476660049). Quickly the arguments turned from stressing the need to show real bodies with their flaws and differences, to critique of the body type she was shopped into having, namely that ""with those proportions she would snap in half""

I also hear the good old ""if barbie was real"" she would have a waist of 18"" and a bust of 36"", and would therefor have to crawl on all fours... 

On [FullerFigureFullerBust's post on celeb bra sizes](http://fullerfigurefullerbust.com/2012/12/11/celebrity-bra-sizes/) we also saw a lot of comments like ""they would be falling on their faces from the weight of their chests in proportion to the rest of their bodies"" when she suggested sizes like 24K/28F-GG/30FF-J.

And I really have to think... What? Besides having completely exaggerated ideas of what those sizes look like, I really can't think what on earth they are thinking... Bodies don't just snap? And haven't we all seen some examples of [very large busts on small bodies](http://bodygeeks.com/2011/04/wtf-wednesdays-the-top-5-largest-fake-breasts-in-the-world/) (trigger warning for probably bodyshaming article)

The Barbie one, 18"" waist is of course very small, but still not unheard of: You can buy it as a corset size at WhatKatieDid, which is still fairly mainstream.. Assuming a 4-6"" waist reduction, and a slightly larger underbust, ""barbie"" could be a 24HH-26GG, which is not at all an ""impossible"" size. 

I can't imagine why someone would think certain sizes would be impossible to even 'carry' - even if we aren't talking about boobs, haven't we all tried carrying an extremely heavy back-pack, or how about women pregnant with twins? If we can carry that sort of weight, of course we can carry out breasts!! Sure, especially without a good bra, it can be a strain, but not something that will make us crawl on all 4's or literally break unless we also suffer from some pretty severe physical problems....

What on earth do you imagine those people are thinking, when they think bodies can't bear large breasts? They give bodies too little credit!

I've also heard a similar thing happen to other girls, even when they were older. People think that just because you have a body that's ""built for sin"", you're certainly engaging in it.

As a 34G who developed young, I always felt like I was deformed or something. I remember wanting to be a ""normal"" size (34B sounded good) so bad...especially prior to discovering my actual size (38D...I think not). It's hard when you spill out of every single bra you can find and even the ""full figured"" ugly bras do nothing for you.

But today I snapped this pic of myself celebrating the fact that I was wearing a size 10 jean (was in a 16 6 months ago). When i looked at it, my first thought was ""hey, my boobs don't look gross or monstrous, they look perfect!"" 

But why have I always thought they were ""too big""? I think I know why. I think it's because I was given the message that A, B, and C cups were normal sizes. D cups were really big, but still okay to have. But DD was borderline acceptable. But DDD and up and you required a special, hard to find, 70 hook, ugly bra because your breasts were too big to be accommodated for in a normal person lingerie department. 

And forget about cute. Big boobs meant unattractive boobs that were not to be celebrated by lacey or colorful bras. And no cleavage enhancing bras either... big boobs are not sexy boobs.

So my inability to find a bra gave me the idea that my boobs were too big...not normal...something i should feel embarrassed about. Now I have great bras, but they are still very expensive and hard to find. 

But the bra shops have been lying to me! My boobs aren't too big! They look great on my body. My figure isn't a delinquent. I'm so glad that I learned today that my boobs are good boobs...not problem boobs.

It's late. I hope this makes sense. Thanks for letting me have my rant.

1375647147.0	1jp3hh	My Experience at Victoria's Secret	fhocker30	78	9	23	Today I had a free underwear at Victoria's Secret, and on my way in saw their new bra in a 32DDD. I knew it was going to be too small, (30/32 FF/G) but decided to try it on anyway because it was really cute. Back in the fitting room after the failure with the bra the sales associate approached me and asked how it went. I told her it was too small and that's when she decided to fit me herself, because in her opinion NO WAY could I be bigger than a DDD. She was so condescending towards me like I was a little kid or something which pissed me off. I didn't grow my boobs overnight so I'm pretty sure I know what size I am or at least close. I had read on this subreddit about how horribly VS workers fit, so decided to let her just to see what she measured me. She came up with a 34 C. I had to restrain from laughing while she brought me some bras that I quadboobed out of really bad, then eventually working her way up to a 34DD declaring it was a perfect fit. It clearly was not. They are obviously so willing to make money they will try to lie about bra sizes just to sell their stuff. SO FRUSTRATING. I'm not even THAT big... I seriously don't understand why VS doesn't get different sizes to fit a wider range of people.	t5_2ubfr	True

First things first she told me to keep my bra that DOESN'T FIT on whilst she 'measured'. She told me that it looks fine, fits well, and the floating bit? ""Well sometimes certain styles do that."" and also ""well one side fits well, you're a bit uneven aren't you?"" I get that, I do, I'm roughly a cup-size asymmetrical. But I'd rather have a boob that is a little too small for the bra than a boob too big and being constantly squished and pinched.
After not even bothering with the tape measure she went and got two (horribly boring, dowdy, not-for-a-20-year-old) bras in the same ill-fitting size that I was wearing and asked me to try. Absolutely no uplift and, again, didn't sit snugly.
In the end I was the one who suggested going up a cup size. She seemed suprised I suggested, then even more suprised when it actually fit better, though thanks to the design I actually felt worse about myself than before. I only want a pretty bra that actually fits.

The entire time I was trying bras on she was chatting (loudly) to her collegues about ""poor girl, she's too big, we don't even have sizes that big. Don't know what we're going to do really, there's just none that big in stock.""
Brilliant.

So I decided not to buy anything from there. Time for some internet shopping. grr.

1372831232.0	1hjv7j	RANT Someone tried to invalidate my feelings about my big boobs because there are women who pay to augment theirs	lafephi	81	13	58	So a little background. I hit puberty when I was 10, but through my teens and early 20s I was a solid 34A/B cup. Then my body remembered that there some secondary sexual characteristics it forgot and tacked on boobs. I went from a 34B when I was 22, to a 34DD when I was 25, to 34DDD when I was 28, and now that I am 30, I am a 34DDDD(G). It's been hard, as it was a rather sudden change and figuring out how to clothe and support my new anatomy has been challenging, as you all know. Well today, I posted the video that /u/UpsidedownTreetrunk posted to this subreddit earlier today to my FB feed. I thought she was funny and spot on. Then a friend from HS decided she needed to comment. She started talking about studies that show men become stupider around larger breasts (without citing anything), so that must mean having large breasts must be beneficial. I said that everyone is entitled to their opinion and to having the body that they want and are most comfortable in, but in my experience I'd happily go back to a B cup. Then she said that if people are paying to have their breasts augmented then how can having breasts be a bad thing?! I'm just so frustrated! She has no idea the shoulder and neck pain I have (and I think I'm rather lucky as I have pretty good posture and don't hunch my shoulders), how expensive it is to buy bras, how difficult it is to find clothes that fit, or any of the other numerous problems that having big boobs entails. I don't hate my body, I don't hate my breasts, but I do feel like I would go back to being smaller chested if I had the opportunity just I don't have to spend $70 on a sports bra or buy blouses 1 size larger and then pay to have them altered down to fit me properly! And trust me, as soon as I am done having kids, I am definitely going to be looking into breast reduction surgery. I'm just so angry that she shut me down and completely dismissed my feelings and experience because there are people who pay to have their breasts enlarged. Maybe I need an attitude adjustment. Maybe I'm blowing it out of proportion. Thanks for listening /r/bigboobproblems, I just needed to get that off my chest (pun intended!)!	t5_2ubfr	True

I'm not sure how I feel about that moment.

I have a hard time finding shirts, so I usually cheat and dress in layers. I'll wear a camisole with something open over it. (a shrug, a fitted jacket, a short jacket, ect.) With it getting hotter and hotter where I live, I decided to wear something tighter, cooler, and, consequently, more revealing on an outing outdoors.

I was unprepared for all the compliment-insult hybrids,

""You look so good in that shirt!""

""Thanks!""

""You should wear that sort of thing more often. You always wear such baggy clothes.""

""...I do?""



and



""You look great!""

""Really?""

""Yeah, you can really tell you've lost a lot of weight!""

""I haven't lost any... Wait. What?""



and who could forget...



""You should wear more clothes like that. You have a great figure. Show it off.""

""Oh... Well, thanks, but I don't really like wearing stuff like this every day. I'm more comfortable in-""

""But it makes your chest look too big.""

""I don't understand what you want from me.""


And then I arrived home feeling conflicted. I have since been casting the occasional disheartened glance at the wardrobe I was once moderately proud of.

So, I was visiting some (girl) friends for the first time since finding /r/ABraThatFits and the topic of my boobs came up as per usual.

My friends just told me flat out that I wasn't thin enough to wear such a small band so I was really a 38D/40D

I've been friends with these girls since before I've had breasts so I'm used to them mentioning them casually and even grabbing them when they're drunk but I never thought that they'd just, basically, say I was just fat (not that a 40 band is fat, I know it's to do with a person's rib cage size more than their weight but that's what my friends were implying).

I am *sick* of wearing baggy t-shirts that just make me look huge but if I wear anything tailored I feel so self-conscious about the looks/ comments I get I really don't know which one is best. I'm still not confident enough about my body to just wear what I like so this really annoyed me.  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this or anything :/

Thankyou for all your words of support, I appreciated it! Today I went into a branch of Leia in my local city and got a fitting. The woman in the previous post wanted me in a 38GG or 40G, but  after a proper fitting with a lovely girl who completely understood everyting I am now wearing a 36HH (new flair yay).

I am SO comfy. Like seriously. It's untrue. I even took the tag off in the changing room so I could buy the bra and keep it on because NO WAY was I going back. £70 and two bras later my bank balance hurts but my back definitely doesn't!

The bras I bought are a brand I don't think I've seen mentioned here. It's called 'elomi'. I've been through my fair share of brands but this is by far the most comfortable to grace my chest.

This seems so similar to the US plan to make us all think that breasts only come in 32-40 A-D bra sizes... which every woman here can attest to as false! Do they just want to save some money by not having to make a very diverse assortment of bras, or is there more of a social aspect that plays into it? I don't think its fair that I have to import a basic necessity for my body, just as I don't think men should have to search so hard in order to have safe sex.

After an hour of experimentation, I have determined that my boobs can carry:

While I was looking over some bras, I heard a woman and her friend picking out some bras, and one of the women (who looked similar to my weight) said that she wore a 36 band! Luckily her friend was a bit informed, and talked about how at the specialty bra boutique in our town say to wear a tighter band and bigger cups. I'd been fitted there too so I used it as an opportunity to jump into the conversation!

She was very receptive to my advice (which I was nervous about, as she was middle aged and I'm a young looking 20- I could honestly still be a freshman in high school depending on what I'm wearing) and I refitted her from a 36C to a 32E!

""Well, this isn't going to be accurate because the bra you're wearing right now is too big for you, you can tell by all the gapping. You're measuring to a 34 DD-DDD, but you don't look like it at all, so I'm going to say you're a C.""

1361929889.0	19artu	My story of overcoming big boob and posture-related back problems	francesmcgee	63	4	28	"I have suffered from bad posture pretty much my whole life. When I hit puberty and grew breasts it got worse. Eventually, my poor posture contributed to sciatica (tightness, pain, and tingling all down my right side, from my lower back, through my butt, to my toes).  I have been asking doctors about this since I was about 12 and they usually just blow it off or try to prescribe me drugs. Now that I'm 28, I finally found a doctor to take me seriously (the last one laughed at me when I told her I wanted a breast reduction).  This latest doctor ordered an X-ray and physical therapy. Unfortunately, the x-ray shows some disc degeneration. The good news is that my physical therapist is really, really great! She's the first medical professional who has ever taken me seriously when I explain the big boob problems I have (i.e. seeing over my boobs without bending and slouching awkwardly when I'm cooking).  She is actually really excited to help me. I've been seeing her one hour a week for two months now, and while I'm not totally pain-free all the time, I'm 10x better than before. I can actually stand up straight for more than a minute!

I share my story because I imagine that many of you have gone through, or are dealing with, something similar. I'm not a doctor or a physical therapist, so I'm not medically recommending these exercises to everyone. I'm just sharing what worked for me.  (I should also mention that I have only been wearing the right size bra for a year or two. Thanks /r/bigboobproblems for help with this!)

So, my main issue is that my [pelvis is tilted](http://healthhabits.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/anterior-pelvic-tilt2.png), which is a common problem for women with boobs and big butts. To help with this, my PT has given me exercises to strengthen my glutes and my core. Also, there are lots of great exercises for pelvic tilt on YouTube. 

[This is a pretty good picture](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLCRYa2pYFA/TDVT7OW4F5I/AAAAAAAADu4/nf9jDP2JSoQ/s1600/pelvic_tilt.jpg) of the position for the first, and most helpful exercise she taught me. While in this position, squeeze your abs and try to pull your back toward the floor. When you do this, make sure you feel your lowest abdominal muscles contracting . Hold this position for 10 seconds, and do 10 reps. It seems simple, and like you're barely doing anything, but if you do it right, your abs will probably be sore. 

The next one is done almost the same way, but add to it by lifting one foot slightly, putting it back down, and switching feet. It's like marching really lightly. Alternate legs until you've lifted each leg 5 times, and do 5 reps. 

After I got used the two exercises above, she started having me repeat them while laying on a foam roller. It is lined up with my spine and my head rests on the end. 

After those two, add some glute exercises with [the exercise in this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTX15Qk1xTM).  My PT has me do this same exercise, but I tie a red resistance band around my knees.  She has me squeeze my glutes and my abdominals in the same way as above.  I also do 5 sets of 5. 

The last one is similar to an exercise called [Superman](http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=191).  Instead of lifting both arms and legs at the same time, I lift one arm in an L-shape at the same time as the opposite leg. For example, I lay on my stomach with my arms in a goalpost position resting on the floor. I alternate between lifting my right arm and my left leg, and lifting my left arm and right leg. Make sure to squeeze your glutes with doing this one!  This one strengthens the lower back muscles. 

Another thing that has been helping me is stretching my shoulders.  My mom has bothered me for years to put my shoulders back, but they wouldn't go back and down far enough to look normal. To stretch them, stand in a doorway with your arms up like a goalpost and push your body forward. [Here's an image](http://abbottcenter.com/bostonpaintherapy/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/doorwaystretch.jpg) to show you.  

If you have pain from bad posture, I highly recommend seeing a physical therapist before you end up with permanent damage. If you can't, then try doing these exercises or something similar. I can't believe the difference I am feeling and seeing. Another bonus is that the girls at school are all asking me how I have such flat abs now. I haven't even lost any weight, I just look skinnier without the pelvic tilt.

1365042018.0	1bmtxq	Why am I still so hopeful?	spitzsunflower	66	9	17	"When I walk into a regular store I am well aware that anything boob related will not fit.  Yet for some reason I still look at those cute swimsuit tops and exercise tops anyway.  After looking at them for a while, I start justifying in my head about how perhaps they will fit and I should try them on.

Today I saw this adorable swimsuit top and I thought to myself ""let's try on the largest size, you never know, I could be lucky and it would be so worth it if this cute top fit me.""  When I see something cute in a store I just stop being rational about what size I need and I feel compelled to try it on ""just in case it actually fits!!!"" I get even more hopeful when the sales lady says ""Oh yeah those are very booby, they'll work.""  I proceed to try on the top and see that it makes me look like a porn star and that my breasts are literally falling out of the top.  It saddens me to see that this top would be so cute if it actually fit but that I can't buy it because it will never work.

Does anyone else here do this or is it just me?  I am well aware that tops in regular stores don't fit me and I need to buy stuff online, but for some reason my mind stops being rational when I see a cute top and I somehow justify it to myself to try it on.

1349049045.0	10qfuk	This breast-insulated heart needs to let it all out... 	Deminix	63	8	52	"Let me warn you, this isn't going to be pretty. I apologize for the grammar and spelling. I just needed to finally get this off my chest(definite pun)

Big boobs. I absolutely love my big boobs. All my freaking life however I have been made to feel awful for having large boobs. When I was young I got ridiculed for ""stuffing"", ""trying to hard"", and ""attention seeking"" among others. 

Finally as I got older, and the other girls started developing their boobs mine were no longer a thing that people could mock. It was nice for a change.

It didn't take long to realize, as I grew older that this world wasn't built for us. When I was little I couldn't wait for the day when I could buy clothing that would accommodate my breasts. I mean, when you're &gt;15 there wasn't much available in the juniors department(and what was available usually showed off too much cleavage which I would always be getting in trouble for in school). The dream of nice clothes (something different from my over sized t-shirts) was short lived. 

Society continues to cater to woman with small chests. I wish I knew what it was like to enjoy shopping, to be able to walk into a store during the summer to get a gorgeous bathing suit top. To go and buy bras of all different colors and styles. Our common option? Nude. White. Black. Plus we're lucky to find a store that even caters to those! Why the hell is this?! Seriously. Then when I can find a store that sells bras for people like us they cost anywhere between $65-$80. Even then our colors are still commonly limited to three. 

I want to buy a button up shirt, without having to spend  $100+ dollars plus additional tailoring costs. I want those cute bathing suits and bras. AND FOR THE LOVE OF BRAS I want to be able to not feel bad for having big boobs. (because of course the middle school torment never really did end...)

Being on Reddit has been an interesting experience. On the upside, I have found places like this. A small community where I feel like I belong. There aren't many places on here that let me feel that way. All the time, I'm seeing people talking about their love for woman with small breasts. Yet, they never seem to be able to confess their love without putting woman with big boobs down. Woman and Men do it. Always I'm seeing about how our boobs can even be seen as ""disgusting"" ""saggy"" ""ugly"". I even recall someone saying he would never marry a lady with large boobs because a woman with small ones would be better in the long run (or something like that, it was posted awhile back) I think he even went as far to say that we couldn't be trusted. Even if a troll, those words hurt. Those words make me feel ashamed for having these soft, large, carry along pillows. All of this hate, is driving me nuts. I thought when I got older it would change, and it didn't. I know I shouldn't take to heart all this negativity from strangers I don't know I just can't help it.

I have long been following BBP and have been wanting to get myself into a bigger bra but have faced some little opposition from my mother who has a few preconceived notions about boobs. For all of my post-pubescent life, I have been wearing 38Bs, 36Cs, and at the largest a 36DD. As you can imagine, none of these fit correctly. 
Upon telling mom that my correct bra size is about a 34G, she told me I should consider a reduction. While I was slightly offended by this, I can see her motivation. (I am a scholarship swimmer and boobs are drag.) Anyway, she had a little epiphany while watching TLC’s What Not to Wear where she saw a curvaceous woman resized from a 38DD to a 34I. The fact that a properly fitting bra could make boobs look smaller was amazing to her. 
She is now totally on board after I sent her profile view pictures of before (36C) and after (34G). I just wanted to share this with someone who understands the absolute NEED for a properly fitting bra. If I tell my flatter females friends, they will get irritated with me for being conceited.

The same friend's boyfriend told me that, no offense, but bigger boobs just get in the way of everything and that they looked nice but, for guys, they are just a hassle in bed because you have to work around them.
   Another one of the boyfriends piped in and said that bigger boobs are intimidating and not worth it.

   It didn't help that when I got back home to see my boyfriend (and he only has been for a few weeks, so he is still trying to learn my body) tried to play with my boobs with his mouth, tried to lift my boob up a little, and they are so heavy that he used his teeth and accidentally dug in too hard in and made me bleed.
He has been my friend for forever, so I know that he has never been with anyone bigger than a B-cup. He admitted that he doesn't know how to handle bigger boobs.

I just kind of want to crawl in a hole and because my boobs get in the way of everything so I keep accidentally bumping into them and the pain is horrid. 

Has anyone else had any terrible experiences like these?

So today I went shopping. I was supposed to go with my friend who knew I was going to go with a friend, but last minute her mom said she couldn't go. I went on my own, telling my mom that I was Christmas shopping (which I did, but I also bought a bra). I went to Yonkers first and couldn't find anything, so I left and looked at many other stores, but didn't find any DDD's at all. Then I went back to Yonkers and there was this old lady that was really nice and offered me help. I was really nervous and insecure so I didn't really tell her my size. 

Then I found one bra that actually was a 32DDD, and it was $60 :/. I carried it with me for a little bit, and as that nice lady got off her shift she said that there was another lady that could help me. And it really warms my heart that she was that kind and helpful and I feel almost bad that she couldn't do a whole lot. Eventually I decided to ask if they had any other's in that size, and there weren't any so I bought it. 
I almost regret spending that much on a bra, but I think it may be worth it because it actually fits. Thank you all for giving me encouragement. You guys are all really awesome."	t5_2ubfr	True

 So about a month ago I went to a 'superhero themed party at a friend's house and something hilarious happened. We were all sitting around playing kings (card/drinking game) and I was sitting on the floor, leaning both elbows up on the couch so my boobs like jutting off my chest despite the fact that I was wearing a well fitting ladies-t. My friend who threw the party has a roommate with a tick in her arm from nerve damage- so he hand will randomly flinch once in a while causing her to throw things on accident. The roommate happened to be holding a very full solo cup of rum&amp;coke when from across the coffee table (in front of like 12 people) manages to essentially throw her drink out of her hand and all over me. It was all over my face, my entire shirt was soaked through- I was dripping. I just thought she had tripped on something, and I was laughing to hard to care that she was totally just standing around. That's when my friend bursts out ""OMG [ljohnso8] I'm so glad your ENORMOUS tits were there to  absorb all of that BAHAHAHAHAHA"" of course she had had a couple drinks at this point but I (sober) thought this was the funniest thing once I realized she was totally right- the fact that the entirety of the drink landed squarely on my boobs and soaked my shirt (and pants and face) and without them we would have been trying to clean coke out of her couch and carpet for days! 

**tl;dr: got a drink accidentally tossed on me at a party and the host was so glad she didn't have to clean the carpet/couch because  ""OMG [ljohnso8] I'm so glad your ENORMOUS tits were there to absorb all of that BAHAHAHAHAHA"".**

1376372046.0	1k9ez0	[long rant] I cried in a Nordstrom's dressing room today.	onlykindagreen	65	14	55	"So, I've been waiting a while (at least a year) to get some new bras. I repeatedly told my parents that I needed them, but both of them kind of brushed it off for a long time. It wasn't until recently when I showed them that one of my bra straps on one of my two remaining bras had completely frayed and was only held together by the strap-adjuster that they decided I was right. I'm 20, going to be a junior in college, but they still support me completely (which I'm not complaining about!), so I'm not comfortable going on my own and buying hundreds of dollars worth of lingerie without their consent. My mother is also big chested and recently lost a lot of weight, so she agreed that it was time for both of us to get new bras.

After the advice of many women on reddit, we took the trip to Nordstrom. The closest one was 45 minutes from where we live, so my mom left early from work today and we drove down together. 

When we arrived, I was kind of already let down. I mean, I *know* it's just a department store that happens to carry bigger bras, but secretly I had gotten my hopes so high. I thought I could walk right in and be surrounded by bra cups that looked familiar in huge-ness to the ones I had at home. But it was just...normal. 

Of course, that didn't deter us. We walked into the lingerie section and looked about for a few moments before a young, skinny woman came to ask if we needed help. My mom took the opportunity to tell her that we didn't know our size (which wasn't totally true. I had measured my underbust at 36"" and my bust at an average 50"" - 47"" standing and 52"" leaning, which on /r/abrathatfits had been around a K cup). She offered to fit us, which was great since I knew that with such big measurements my calculated size probably wasn't accurate. 

We get into the dressing room, she separates my mom and I and then measures my mom and leaves me alone in the adjacent dressing room. She goes off to find a bra for my mom, and then after several minutes returns. My mom calls me in and I can see that this woman took no bust measurement. I ask my mom what size she has her in, and it's a 38F. Yeah, no. Not even close. We ask her to go up in cup size. 

While she's gone for another (very strangely long) time, my mom tells me that she didn't measure anything but her underbust, then just guessed. This was annoying, but I guess we could try on a lot of bras, right? Well, sort of. She kept bringing *handfuls* of the next size up, without actually fitting us correctly. She would say, oh, 36F doesn't fit you? Let me bring about 10 different 36FF bras! Try on one style, it doesn't fit, take away all of them, leave us for 5-10 minutes, come back with 10 more in a  36G. And this repeated again and again. 

Finally my mom found some bras that she was comfortable in. I didn't love the fit but there was no folding, they supported her, and they were better than any she has and she was happy, so that was good. 

But now that the focus was on me, it only got worse. She was bringing me these huge, full-coverage bras, that looked like they could belong to my grandmother. And none of them fit. At one point she brought some molded cup bras, which I loved, but they were all way too small, maybe a FF cup at best, so before I could try any on, she whisked them away as well. 

I kept trying to go up in cup size, but then the underwire got way too wide, and jabbed into my armpit. No matter what I tried on, my boobs were either bulging out a bit, or folding back near my armpits. And ALL of the bras I tried were lift and separate, and made my boobs look like pointy mountains, pointing me towards opposite ends of the room. I remarked to my mom that I could fit a 2 liter soda bottle between them. 

I was getting frustrated, cooped up in this tiny room, waiting on this girl. I am **20 fucking years old** is it too much to ask for a proper fitting bra? One that gives me cleavage I can show off to my boyfriend? One that makes me feel pretty? One that I can wear a relatively low-cut t-shirt in? Is that too much? It doesn't even have to be lacy or pretty, but please, no more grandma bras. 

So, finally, I was trying on 36J cups, and they were still crappy, just the underwire kept getting wider, rather than the cups getting bigger, and the cups weren't holding all of my boobs and it was a disaster. The woman finally admitted that they didn't go past a JJ cup, and the one I had tried on didn't seem to fit. I mean, she wasn't trying any different styles, so no duh. Clearly this one didn't work, please, something new!

So finally I put on my old bra (which sadly felt better compared to the ones I have been trying on. And, I'm sure many of you know, you *want* to feel like crap when you put on your old bra after a fitting, you most certainly do *not* want to feel relief when this ripped up, stained, unsupportive bra is better than any of these new ones you've been shoving your boobs into). I walked onto the floor to look for myself. Honestly, they didn't have any styles I liked unless they were a C cup at most. Anything bigger than that was almost no padding, and a lot lift-and-separate action. There were even a few Cleo by Panache bras! I got really excited, only to find they go up to a G cup in this store, and that's it. I KNOW they're D-J. The main reason I came to this store specifically was because after reading the fabulous reviews here, I went to the Cleo website and looked up where I could buy them in store. This was the only place near me. And, it was just D-G. I kind of felt like somebody had stepped on my throat.

So I went back into the dressing room with my mother. I tried on one cleo in G for good measure, it was awful. I took it off and I cried. I cried, topless, in front of my mother, in that horrible dressing room. I know it's silly and probably paints me as immature but I couldn't handle it. I got my hopes too far up. I didn't realize it beforehand, but I had secretly been thinking that Nordstom would finally be the end-all-be-all of big boobed bra shopping. I had thought I would walk in and leave with armfulls of wonderful bras. I didn't expect it to be even more frustrating than when a store simply doesn't carry my size.

My mother left and found me several bras. I found one that really fit. **One.** It was a 36HH. And we bought it, but I'm not happy with it. It was the only bra that had no folding in my breast tissue at all. I really fit into it. But, the center underwire pushed quite hard into my chest, not painful, but a little too snug really, and it came up very high, to the top of my breast tissue. And it's some serious lift and separate action, and I didn't like how I looked in profile. My boobs were gone, shoved out to she sides, and just showcased how tubby I was. My mom's condolence was ""well I had to learn to deal with that at your age too."" So I guess that just means I should suck it up and realize I will never have nice round boobs ever again?

We found two other bras. One exactly like one I have at home that I don't love, but I can wear under a tshirt since it's smooth I makes my boobs fold over on the sides, but so did all the other bras and at least this one isn't horrible. And another that I liked the style, but they stopped just below an H cup. So I got a GG cup and just kind of shoved my boobs in there and said that I'd lose the weight to fit into it. I wanted to cry when we checked out. Looking at these bras I was having my parents pay so much money for, that I didn't even love. I was settling because all of my other bras are broken, have underwire that has ripped through and jabs me, or have straps and bands that are stretched to twice their original size. Right now I'm wearing a 38G old bra. I know I'm at least a 36HH. It sucks.

I don't think my mother understood how upsetting it was for me, which was aggravating since she has large boobs as well, and I figured she had at one point gone through something similar. We walked around the large mall for about 10 minutes after checking out, all the while I was trying not to cry. She offered to get food at the food court but I wasn't hungry. The drive home she was normal as usual, and only after almost 30 minutes of my silence did she do a double take and ask ""what's wrong? Are you upset because of the bra thing?"" And I just said yeah and tried to downplay it. 

I know I can order offline and such, I just felt incredibly crushed today. I felt like there's really not a good size that I fit into. If I go up in cup size while staying in my band size, the cup material doesn't get bigger, the underwire just gets wider, so my boobs squish out to the sides and get folded over, whild the wire pokes my underarm fat. I felt really fat. I know I'm way overweight, but seeing my boobs squished into these ugly bras, and seeing my armpit pudge popping out on the sides of every bra, and seeing my back fat bubbling out from these new tight bands was pretty crushing. Especially in the horrible dressing room light. I know I have to lose weight, so maybe one day I'll go back and fit into one of those bras I liked, but I also know bras aren't like clothes, I probably won't just shrink down into pretty-bra sizes even when the weight is gone.

So we got home, I went inside, left my new bras in the car, put on netflix and cried in my living room. Then I curled up and fell asleep and now I'm awake at 1 in the morning and I wanted to tell somebody who would get it.

So...yes..

I know this is such a long rant, and nobody has to read it, I don't blame anyone for skipping, but I wanted to just vent. I really thought I would come home today happy with several new bras, feel happy and pretty and maybe even a little sexy. I didn't expect to feel fat and hopeless and feel like I should never have tried in the first place.

I work at an IT department. When I started, there was no dress code. I never wore revealing clothes, but I did wear some that were lower cut than others (Which I haven't worn after 2 months of working since I caught some coworkers looking down my shirt.) I am a 38 DDD and it's hard to find clothes that fit me. I never show cleavage, and when I do, it is on accedent. When I notice my shirt has been pulled down a little bit, I just tug it back up into place. 


There is another woman who works where I work. She was just promoted. She deserved it, and she is a sweetheart. Today she asked me to come into her office. She had me sit down, and said, ""So I was asked to talk to you by the boss about your clothes. He has had a coworker comment on your breasts and he (the boss) thinks it is inappropriate and wanted me to tell you that you need to wear more covering, loose shirts."" 



I wasn't upset at her. 


I was upset at the fact that because someone said something about my boobs, I can't wear any of my clothes I have now. And now I have to pay money to get the ""official"" work shirts (that no one ever buys because it's $30 a shirt.) Or I can wear pull over hoodies, which can get hot very fast when you are lifting computers and running around the office. 

I wear flattering shirts that make me feel better. I don't wear anything too small or anything. I know it is in a business environment, but I am not showing anything. I am appropriate at all times. It was never my intention to have people stare at my boobs. 



I agreed with her and told her I will dress better.

I'm taking a trip with some friends this weekend, and we were planning on swimming at some really cool spring-fed pool, but I don't really own a swimsuit. (I don't swim much.)

I'm really pretty average-sized overall, and I'm only a 34DD/32E, so I figured if I could find a top in an XL that just ties on, that would work just fine. I went to Target (where a medium top of this description fit me with coverage to spare at a C back in the day)and I tried on two slightly different ones like that and I also found a tankini top in a medium that was pretty generous in the bust that I tried on as well. All were under $20. The XL tie-on tops fit more like a small. I felt like if I sneezed my boob would pop out. The tankini surprisingly fit well in the bust and covered things pretty well, but there was enough extra fabric around the middle that you could have fit another half of me in there! (And it was only a medium! WTF!)

I know that there are plenty of places on the internet where I can get a swimsuit top that fits. I also know that there are specialty shops that carry tops that will fit me. But the former requires knowing more than a week in advance that my friends want to take me out of town, and the latter requires that I invest quite a bit more than $20 in a last-minute purchase of something that I might only use a couple times a year anyway.

I guess I'm just not allowed to take last-minute vacations.

Anyway, if anyone knows where I can pick up a cheap top before Friday that will at least keep me from exposing myself...maybe I won't have another episode where I'm sobbing and yelling ""MY BOOBS ARE NOT THAT BIG!"" over and over at my boyfriend."	t5_2ubfr	True

I've been wearing a 38 D/40 DD for three years, and I found the bra fit guide from MyWifesBusty recently so I thought ""Hey, why not, at least this will confirm."" That guide said that I am actually a 38 E/F. I suppose I wasn't *that* far off, but still enough that I wanted to get some new bras. I'm a broke college student, so I was kind of stressing finding money in my budget for it and complaining to my friend (who is a 36H) and she said ""Oh, I have a whole bunch of bras at that size that don't fit me! Come to my house and try them out."" 

I went home last night with 18 brand new, or nearly new, bras. Eight. Teen. I had 3 before going over there, and they were all very plain and ""everyday"" Vanity Fair bras that I got on a ""Buy two, get one free"" sale at Macy's two summers ago. These are all bows and lace and very, very... sexy. I've never had a bra that did amazing things for my boobs. She was cracking up at me trying them on in the mirror because I was astounded at the Victorian level of cleavage I had going on.

On top of that, she had a bag full of 23 size 34-36 B/C bras that I am going to take to my other friends (both of whom are pumped since they're also students. One of them only has one bra right now!) and I will continue to spread the joy of pretty bras to my friends. Not only is my friend is a bra hoarder, but she had previously convinced herself that she was a B cup. She apparently still has more than what she gave me and the bag for my friends combined. Wat.

Honestly, this may be more bras than I have ever had in my entire life. I've always only had 2-3 at a time, it blows my mind that I could wear a different bra every day for two weeks and still have leftovers.

1367605881.0	1dmtm2	This is why you shouldn't trust a store that measures you over your clothes... (x-post from /r/abrathatfits)	nyx1234	54	14	24	"I made [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-LVey97H8) showing how when you get measured at Victoria's Secret (or other places with similar methods) the bra you're wearing underneath your clothes makes a HUGE difference.

Here are the measurements/bra sizes I could get, depending on the bra I was wearing when I got measured (for if you don't want to/can't watch the video):

1. Braless- 34 overbust, 40 bust, 34DDD
2. 28K PL Mak - 37 overbust, 40 bust, 36D
3. 28JJ Princess - 37 overbust, 39 bust, 36C
4. 30G Deco - 38 overbust, 39.5 bust, 38A/B
5. 34DD Very Sexy Pushup (not shown in the linked video) - 37 over bust, 38 bust, 36B

So seriously, if you go to Lane Bryant, Victoria's Secret, any department store that measures you over your clothes and in a bra... you're going to have a bad time. Even if they take the underbust measurement properly instead of overbust, the bust measurements vary pretty widely as well!"	t5_2ubfr	True

Living as a Teenage Big Foot
	Hi, my name is Taylor and I have big feet. There, I said it. Not like it totally isn't noticeable or anything. For whatever reason, it’s such a taboo topic. I acknowledge that I have big feet, other people acknowledge I have big feet, but God forbid I mention it to another living, breathing organism. What a social abomination! 
	If I ever make a single complaint about my big feet, I’m met with eye rolls, and people telling me they wish they had my problem and that I’d appreciate them when I’m older and blah blah blah. No one actually listens to what I have to say or consider the complications I endlessly endure. Having big feet is an all-consuming, arduous, and sometimes even heinous atrocity.
	Let me present to you problemo numero uno: the looks. If I had a dollar for every time a guy looked at my feet in the hallways, grocery stores, at the bookstore, even out with my boyfriend, I could pay for my entire college tuition…I'm going to a private school. Some of my favorites have to be the guy who looked at my feet through a window of a door at school. My feet weren't even suggestive: I was wearing ballet flats, you got only the slightest bit of toe cleavage. I'd honestly wear those shoes around my grandparents. The other outstandingly memorable situation was a guy at Target who actually did the movie-style check-out in which he lifted up his sunglasses and pedophically ogled to get a better look at my feet. I was wearing Nike High-Tops. There literally wasn't even anything to look at. Simply, it's annoying and unnecessary. It might make me sound like the average attention-craving, bellicose teenage girl, but unless you're a large-footed teenage girl, it’s hard to comprehend the struggles of having big feet. 
	Having big feet, you're often treated like an object. Like nothing you do matters because no one can see past your feet, and no matter what you accomplish, it’s always going to be smaller than your feet. To the vast majority of boys, you're literally just a pair of feet: you're the girl in someone's math class with big feet. The girl in your check out line whose name you can’t remember even though you scanned her debit card and membership card because her only outstanding feature was her feet. Or the girl you passed in the hallway avoiding eye contact because she doesn’t want to draw attention to herself and her feet. I’ve lost count of the number of boys I’ve had conversations with that don’t make eye contact with me once. Instead, they blatantly talk to my feet. Boys, while I appreciate that you “like my anklet”, we both know you mean my feet and not my jewelry.
	And almost worse than teenage boys? Teenage girls. The catty, hateful looks. The venomously snarky comments. The maliciously judgmental questions. Girls that don't have big feet whine and complain and say they want bigger feet so they get more attention, and, no matter how you say it, they don't understand the issues accompanied with big feet. They treat us like we're an entirely different class of females that should be looked down upon, that their boyfriends can’t talk to because we have big feet so we must be morally loose.
	It's also assumed that we think we're better than everyone because we have big feet. That all we do is show them off and use your feet to get ahead. There's the stereotype that girls with big feet are always, 100% of the time, being overtly sexual and inappropriate when we just can't help that we have big feet. Girls with big feet aren't considered serious. Like we're all just bimbos who aren't good for anything except gold-digging and shopping and fawning over our husband who’s only with us because we’re a hot trophy wife with big feet that cooks and cleans in skin-tight dresses. Well you know what? This big-footed girl is majoring in behavioral economics and is going to get her bachelors, masters, and doctorate, wants to be a college professor and write a book or two and make a name for herself. Not on the list? Be someone’s trophy wife.
	To be the trophy wife stereotype, you have to dress like a trophy wife. This means tight clothes, short skirts and dresses, and revealing necklines. This trend is obviously demonstrated just walking through the hallways at school. Essentially, us big-footed girls have two extremes: we can wear the short skirts, tight dresses, and revealing tops everyone else wears, having them appear exponentially more inappropriate on us, or we can go to the other side and wear excessively loose shirts, baggy sweat pants, and colossally humongous sweatshirts that make us look whaleish and apprehensively pusillanimous. There’s no winning either way. There’s such a small gap we have to force ourselves through to find the right clothes that don’t exceed the potential opportunity cost of throwing on sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
	On the topic of clothes: the paramount supportive shoe. It's near impossible to find a pair of shoes that fit well. They'll be long enough, but way too wide. Or they'll be absolutely adorable.... and not in anything more than an itty-bitty-teeny-weeny size. In order to fit larger feet, one needs to order shoes from Europe. The way it works in the US is they only make up to a certain size then just add fractional sizes as opposed to whole sizes increments. So for someone with big feet, you need to order shoes from Europe. Do you know how hard it is to order something that essential online without being able to try it on? Or how expensive cross-continental shipping gets? Or the different size conversion for shoes from your country to another? Or all the forms you need to fill out when you inevitably need to return items? The list of hassles is literally never ends.
	And I can’t forget the unavoidable physical activity. Gym class is like a specialized hell for girls with big feet. Volleyball? Nope. Jumping jacks? Ouch. Running? Nuh-uh. Jump roping? Don't even try it. It's so hard to find the right size sport shoe to wear that it isn't even worth it. It causes physical problems too. It starts with back problems, then goes to shoulder problems that lead to irreversible, irreparable posture problems. High school sports that are oh so necessary to get into college are a struggle comparable to climbing Mount Everest in the middle of a blizzard. It's just a whole lot of no way José. 
	As if all of that isn’t enough, they cause daily embarrassments. Like reaching across a table while eating and having your big feet knock over everything in their way, wrecking-ball style. Or getting unpropitious stains on the underside of your feet and not knowing until someone points it out to you. Or the bizarre gap you get between buttons when wearing a button up shoe. And even worse? Having the buttons pop off in the middle of whatever you’re doing and have to stop in the middle of it to find another shoe. And the way people go about acknowledging it is a whole new level of embarrassment. Like when you tell your track coach you need a bigger uniform top, gracelessly explaining that the upper part of the top is too small, only to have her say, “I KNOW, your feet are HUGE!” Or trying to go tubing with your boyfriend on his family’s boat, only to have them hand you a women’s medium life-preserving-jacket…. that is quickly switched out to a women’s large. Then to a men’s small. Men’s medium. Men’s large. And topping it off at a men’s extra large that still doesn’t close all the way. And the excessively juvenile game of basketball, in which the space between your foot and your sock is the basket and anything flickable is flicked that direction with hopes that it will land in the basket and the flicker will score a point. At which point in time this was considered acceptable, I’d like to know. Because I’d sure like to travel back to then and find the pompous pig who started it and punch him really, really hard. And about liking them when I’m older: yeah, I’m totally dying to have even worse back problems and even more problems shopping and struggling to be “workplace appropriate” and deflecting creepy guys and living out this ceaseless turmoil… Not.
	…Still think I don’t know what I’m talking about and need to just shut up and appreciate it? They do always say that you can’t understand someone else’s point of view until you walk a mile in their shoes. 
	Well, “c’est la vie”. If I spend my whole life walking around putting myself down for it, I’m no better than the others who put me down for it. Besides, you know what they say about people with big feet… we have big socks.

I arrived armed with knowledge of my band size and cup size thanks to the measuring guides here, how the bra should fit, and what's the best shape for me. The lady that owned the shop was amazing and really knew what she was doing. I think I surprised her with how much I knew about bra sizing and fit. 

She felt sorry for me for my size and how hard I was to size but I was able to walk out of there wearing one new bra with two more in tow. Even though I was a first time customer she gave me her special offer for regular customers because she knew how badly I needed the bras. So I got one bra already on sale for $40 and then I got 2 $80 bras one for which she only charged me $40. 

This is the first time I have had a bra fit me perfectly since I started wearing them when I was 10 years old. I feel better, my girls feel better and my husband even said that they look perkier and surprisingly bigger. lol

1358221883.0	16lig8	Water parks, titty issues, and a whole lot of ranting.	almaknight	47	3	21	"So it's time for my winter company party. I'm somewhat new at this place so I feel like I ought to jump on board with anything that'll get me closer to my co-workers, who are an awesome fun bunch to begin with. I like my co-workers and I want to have fun with them.

This year, the company is renting out a water park. I have not owned a proper swimsuit since I was a teenager. Don't get me wrong, I've had many a fun time at the beach or at pool parties wearing booty shorts and a tight tank top, even if a stray boobie were to show up whilst being flipped into the water by friends.

There are a lot of activities and contests, but literally no reason to be there if you're not down to be hanging out with your co-workers in swimwear.

And of course I can't just go buy a swimsuit.

The flier for that party was posted too close to the date for me to justify ordering something online that may not get here in time. I could head to my local nordstrom, but my finances are a little too tight for a $200 swimsuit that I likely won't give two shits about when ""drinking at the beach"" season comes back.

Did I mention it's an alcohol-free event?

I alter my clothes to make me look good. When I decide how to dress, I have control over how I look. 

If I had the same control over my swimsuit (sorry I'm actually really good at diving but I can't enter the back-flip contest cuz my tits will fly out) everything would be gravy.

Why can't we just rent out a bar and sing karaoke? Why?

I'd like to preface this rant/plea for advice with asdfghjkl. That's the verbalized version of how I feel when I try on my graduation dress, and I look - in my eyes at least - fucking bomb in it, but then my mom comes and starts commenting on how the dress shows too much of my boobs.

The fact is, I'm a fat woman with big boobs. Earlier I've covered them up. I can't help with their size or visibility from the dress. No matter how high I hike the dress, it slowly drips down. I actually really freakin' love my boobies, with or without the dress. But now my mom's suggesting I should cover them up with a scarf that covers my chest completely and hangs on my belly, making me look like I'm pregnant with quadruplets.

So, I like my dress&amp;boobs, she doesn't. There shouldn't be a problem here, right? I'm an adult, I can dress any way I want. But listening to her constant reminders of ""they're almost JUMPING at me from that dress!"" hurts me and I sort of start questioning my cleavage. Is it possible that it's too showy? Is there something wrong with showing cleavage? Am I being an attention whore or desperate or whatever? I hate this self-doubt, since I actually think the dress is the best thing I've ever purchased in my life, and without all the criticism I wouldn't even think twice and I'd just look baller on my graduation day, my own special day. Now I'm stuck thinking if I look like a slut or something and if I should cover myself up, and I don't want to think about that while partying.

And to add to this, my mom hates her own boobs too. She has boobs just like mine, big. She's constantly asking me ""how can I make my boobs smaller, is there any exercise I could repeat that would make them smaller?"". I honestly think she's projecting her hate of her boobs back to me, expecting me to hate my chest-baggies as well. Well, I don't!

**TLDR;** I have big boobs and lots of cleavage in my graduation dress. Mom hates her own boobs and doesn't like mine in the dress either, constantly criticizing, making me doubt my awesome dress and awesome boobs. What do?

So, help please? Opinions? Is she right? What can I say to her so that I won't offend her? Every time I try the dress on I feel sad and depressed with her comments, even though deep inside I think I look the most beautiful I've ever looked in my life.

**// Edit.** Thank you for all of your wonderful, kind, encouraging, helpful comments and compliments. This is a great community, you are all great people. :) I will bring up the boob issue with mom the next time I try my dress on, using some of the great arguments you guys provided.

Now I know not all racks carry past F cup, mine seems to think women only need E cups.  So I asked if there was a way to request size options.  

Now I am not a small woman, but I am not a plus size woman either.  I wear a size 10.  I am also 5'9 so it works for me.   But when I asked about them ever having 34HH or anything around there I was told ""We do not carry many plus size bras.""  I was a bit insulted as well...  I do not feel that should be considered plus size and even then my real size is a 32 band but I am between an HH and J, also Nordstrom only carries up to and HH from what I know.  I wear the same band size as most of my female friends (well the ones that are properly fitted)  So it just took me off guard.  Then the woman went and said she wears a 36D (let me tell you she was not a 36D she was smaller frame than me and even if she likes the 36 band she was way bigger than a D cup, I would say an F or FF...)  yet she didn't consider her size plus, just average... UGH BIG BOOBIES DON'T MEAN PLUS SIZE!  

Even then as a woman that has has body image issues all her life I do get a little hurt when I work out hard and stay in shape only to be informed I don't look it.  :(  Luckily my friend was there to cheer me up.  Other wise I am sure I would have been butt hurt for a few hours."	t5_2ubfr	True

I finally have a bra that fits!

I've never had a bra that actually fit well and felt comfortable before, ever since I grew to a DD in 9th grade(I literally grew in 2-3 months, and never stopped.)

My mom never really knew what to do, she's only ever been a small B, she's 5'7"", and I was 5'2"" with a very large chest, so I never had anywhere to turn. I thought bras were supposed to be uncomfortable and big boobs were supposed to give you back pain!

I've been going to Victoria secret and you probably know how that turned out. I've been wearing a 36DD for about 4-5 years, and it's only been the past few months that I knew I shouldn't feel this way- uncomfortable, ashamed, and just unhappy every time I thought about it. 

I finally became fed up with my useless bras and threw them away. I felt frustrated when I even thought of wearing them, but that also left me with no bras.

So since the semester started, I've been wearing some cheapy sports bras I found at Academy, questing for a bra that actually fits. I haven't actually worn anything that wasn't a t-shirt and jeans since August.

I've sent them back twice now, and I finally got my third order today, and I've got to say: AMAZING!!!!

And for comparison to what I've been wearing, I'm actually a 32 GG(UK)! What a difference.

My goodness do they feel nice, and my clothes look great! I can stand, I can bend, I can WALK without spillage! 

I feel ecstatic and I just wanted to share this with you! You ladies are a great community and I just couldn't have gone through with this without you!

I know this isn't a big boob problem, but it would be a crime not to show other big-boobed redditors how amazing it would feel with a good bra, and maybe not have to consider reduction surgery. I know I was thinking about it for awhile.

So, I wanna hear 'em. Tell me your success stories, the first time a bra really fit, how you felt, everything!  I want to keep this good mood aflowin'! (My first post too!)

Today I went to Nordstrom for the first time and felt totally taken care of! The lady was nice and young and felt no shame tugging at different parts of the bra to make sure it fit right. She only had to measure under the bust and glance at my chest, and came back with the perfect size! I walked in wearing a 34DD and walked out in a 30G- I still have it on, and hours later, I've almost forgotten I have boobs! There's not that constant reminder of discomfort on my chest!

1347058997.0	zj3n3	I experience a lot of hatred from other women because of my boobs. I am tired of simply ignoring it, but what else can I do?	procrasturbating_nun	42	2	38	"I am only a 34 D. I know that size doesn't compare to most of the ladies on here, and my problems while similar to yours probably aren't nearly as bad. If I have trouble finding shirts that fit, I can only imagine how difficult it must be for someone with bigger boobs than mine. This is why I am coming to you for advice.

Lately, it seems my boyfriend doesn't want me to go out with *any* cleavage showing. He says it's because he sees other men staring, but it's mostly because he sees other women glaring hatefully at me. He also mentioned it makes him uncomfortable, and that I should stop. One day, a girl who was a bit thinner than me, with boobs much smaller than mine was wearing the exact same dress as me. My boyfriend said she can wear that dress anytime and it's appropriate because you can't see any cleavage. 

I completely ignored his comment. He doesn't buy his own clothes, so I don't trust his judgement when it comes to fashion. However, today while I was at a gas station with him I was wearing a normal tank top and a pair of shorts. I didn't really think anything of it because it's *90 fucking degrees* outside and I don't want to sweat my tits off. To my surprise, I outraged another lady with my outfit. As I was leaving she commented to her son that I was gross and that I should be ashamed of myself. I ignored the comment, but told my boyfriend about it once we were in the car. He actually agreed with her, in a way. He said that I shouldn't leave the house looking like that unless I expect some negative attention. I just can't understand this. I wasn't all done up, I had on zero make-up. I was just a lady in a tank top, what's wrong with that? ( Even if I did take the time to apply make-up, etc. today it still wouldn't give that woman an excuse to behave the way she did. ) This kind of thing happens to me at least three times a week.

Anyway, enough ranting. Is there anything I can do about this?  Even if I wear a shirt that simply fits right someone has something to say about. I hate to admit it, but this is starting to make me angry. I have tired wearing loose fitting clothing, but it looks horrible so it's not very comfortable.

1340040008.0	v8d36	[Rant] Shamed at VS for bra selection.	maidenlush	44	6	20	I went to Victoria's Secret to get a fitting since the most recent bras I bought seemed to be a bit small and causing spillage.  (I know VS isn't exactly the best place to get bras or fittings.)  So I asked to try on a 34DDD bra as my current bra was a 34DD and the band fit perfectly; it was just the cups that I had issues with.  The girl doing my fitting tried to throw me in 38D, 38DD, and 36DD.  I don't see how my ribcage suddenly expanded when the cups were the issue.  After asking again for a 34DDD she finally went to find one with much chagrin.  She came back with a full coverage and a demi so I tried them both on and they fit wonderfully.  I decided to get them both and she told me that at my size I really shouldn't be wearing any demis or balconette bras and that I need to stick to full coverage.  I said that I wanted the demi though for tops that are a bit lower cut and she asked if I thought that was a good idea.  That I would be showing way too much.  I just said that I was a big girl and could dress myself just fine thank you.  ಠ_ಠ    	t5_2ubfr	True

I have this shirt in three colors/patterns. So easy to wear, just throw it on with leggings and a cute pair of shoes, maybe a long open front cardigan on a colder day. 

I wear a medium in this because it's definitely oversized, normally I'm a L/XL. I usually wear it with the tie belt that it comes with but it's cute with other belts too. It's pretty long and may be too long on someone shorter.

I usually don't even attempt in-store bra-shopping and do most of mine online, but since I'm going on a trip in a week and badly needed a strapless bra, I didn't have enough time to order one. So I went to Macy's (I'd previously had sports bra success there) but the minute I told the sales girl my size she just gave me this defeated look and told me not to even try there. So I went to Nordstroms instead, where I had the greatest salesgirl who took one look at my sad, 3-year-old horribly-fitting 36DD, immediately grabbed about 8 (CUTE) bras in my actual size and proceeded to outfit me with two of the best fitting bras I've had in years. They were pricier than I would normally pay online, but my boobs are so happy :) I told my mom about this but she is a 34B and really doesn't get how awesome this feels.

1368073150.0	1dzdid	If you can sew a button you can make your shirt fit!	TARDISkitty	41	5	22	"I have seen so many posts about shirts always being too small for boobs until you get a huge size and hide your waist. I solved this problem for myself years ago and would like to share how. Like I said in the intro the only sewing skill needed is be able to sew a button. The whole process takes about ten minutes. Sorry my shirt is so wrinkly, it's been in my hamper.

[My favorite shirt](http://imgur.com/a/gbWqA)

step 1: find a shirt that fits your boobs

step 2: mark with a safety pin on the shirt(or whatever will pinch the fabric for a few minutes) where your waist is the smallest.

step three: figure out how many inches smaller you would like the shirt to be (i just kinda grab the excess and guess, it doesn't need to be an exact science yet)

step four:lie the shirt flat with the back of the shirt facing you(what people see if they're standing behind you)

step five:at the smallest part of your waist (marked on the shirt) find the very center of the back then fold from both sides toward the center, you can fold a little or a lot.

step six: sew a button at the edge of the fold at the smallest part of your waist(if you want to get really picky here is where you would pin the button so you can still move it) 

step seven: on the opposite fold make a loop with a tiny bit of ribbon(make sure the button will fit through this loop without falling out) sew the ribbon down just like the button(if you're being picky pin it then button the shirt and put it on to see if you would like it tighter/looser)

step eight: iron the folds really well and it looks super cute and keeps it fitted well all day(or a couple wears if you're lazy like me)

If this is confusing at any point please feel free to ask questions, I'm terrible at describing things usually but would really like to help my fellow boobiters out.

Edit: I hope I don't sound rude or aggressive I'm just super excited to help people."	t5_2ubfr	True

I was ""blessed"" with high set, even to slightly full on bottom, very round (no, really, imagine two beach balls) breasts, that are firm, dense, and perky and have upward pointing nipples that are about average size. They retain this shape in and out of bras, and are shallow with very little projection. These are all natural characteristics of my breasts, and I'll throw it out there that my SO absolutely adores them. But I hate them.

I cannot wear bras comfortably. I've learned that this is the way the world works for my breasts. Because they do not, under any circumstances, take the shape of my bras, they instead push the bras into crazy positions, and push the underwire down into my ribs no matter how often I slide it back up into the inframammary fold. This doesn't get better with a tighter band-- 28s ride up on the tightest hook, and 26s kill me on the loosest hook. My cups all have excess fabric that's smooshed flat against my torso as my boobs push the wires away-- doesn't matter if it's a shallow bra like CK Tempt Me or a super projected Cleo.

Another problem is probably just because underwires don't exist to work with my breast shape. I need very wide wires, but not too wide because my breasts are so high set as to force them up into my armpits painfully. I have breast tissue under my armpits, though, so any fabric that's up there needs to be super soft and loose, but I've not found a bra to help with that.

Every bra is painful (all 47 styles I've tried on since visiting r/abrathatfits), so maybe I could try just going without, or wearing just a bralette, right? Except holy boobage. If I'm not wearing a bra, I can't walk without pain from them jiggling, because they're basically antigravity boobs, and so there's no gravity at all to hold them still. The only exception to this ""every bra is painful"" thing is my Panache Sport, but as many of you know, that's not really a bra that can be worn under clothing, and I'd really like to have more options than just that one sports bra.

I just wish my boobs were saggy, and not perky. I wish I could put on a bra, and that if would fit. I wish my boobs were softer, so they could fill the cups instead of mutilating them. Less relevant to bras, I wish my boobs were saggier so people didn't ask me how long ago I ""had them done"". I wish they were saggier so that I could look at the ""real breasts gallery"" and see breasts like mine. I wish they were saggy so that they'd actually look as big as they are, so people would stop saying ""They're not that big,"" or ""Just go braless-- you're not that big.""

I'm just frustrated... Sorry for the rant/sadness/immaturity, guys. I guess it's just something to keep in mind-- everyone wishes something were different about their body, but what if the people who had those things you wish you had wished they had the things you have? (Wow, that's actually a really awkward way to say ""the grass is always greener...""). *sigh* Sometimes I wish I'd never discovered r/abrathatfits, so I could be blissfully unaware of how terrible my shape is while wearing $50 nipple hats in 34C from Victoria's Secret, not knowing that those didn't fit."	t5_2ubfr	True

So this is a bit of a rant, I've recently found this sub and I found myself frustrated beyond belief today. My boobs really aren't *that* big. I'm about a 34 E I think depending on the brand. I **thought** going to a big name department store would yield better results for me rather than going to VS or some bra ""specialty"" place in the mall. 

So I went to Von Maur today and started asking the lovely sales girl about the sizes they carried. She didn't believe I was bigger than a DD and insisted on fitting me. She decided I was a 38 D with some bullshit about sister sizes. 
A. How the hell could I walk in with a 34 band (that fits well) and all of a sudden by her magic math be a full 4 more inches around?!

She gives a few and I try them on and show her the band is sloppy and still my cups runneth over. She is plainly surprised and starts explaining that I should try 34DDD and 34DDDD. My cups runneth over with every bra regardless of brand. Albeit the cute Calvin Klein number was the most comfortable despite the quad boob.

After 30 minutes of trying on bras I left in tears. Even the DDD and DDDD that *almost* fit were plain and ugly. Why can't I have a pretty plunge bra that supports me? Must I only have the option of total coverage which severely limits any shirt or dress with a low neckline?

I know I have options online, but since all bras fit differently I **hate** that I can't try them on and have to pay double the shipping if they don't fit. I have 2 ratty bras from VS that are a 32DD. One has straps that are constantly loosening themselves and the other has a busted underwire. I have nice Chantelle bras I got via bra swap however, they're the super coverage and they're a bit big unless I'm on my period in which case my stupid boobs swell up an additional 2 cup sizes. God knows what will happen when I get pregnant! 

I'm sad, pissed and sick of uncomfortable shitty bras. :( 
**TLDR** Why the hell isn't there a lingerie store in every major city for big busted women?! It should be a basic human right as far as I'm concerned.

Yesterday (Sunday) was the only day I had available for shopping, and I had planned on getting some new dress shoes, a suit jacket, and some new bras. 

So on Sunday morning I looked up the address and hours for the bra store, and then I find out that they're only open Tuesday-Saturday. Awesome. This would have been my first time actually trying on bras that fit in a store. I'm so, so tired of ordering bras online and not even knowing if they'll fit until I've already spent way more money than I'd like to. A lot of the time I'll end up keeping bras that are only 'good enough' since it wouldn't be worth it to pay for overseas return shipping. 

So no new bras. I absolutely needed a suit jacket, since I'm giving a huge presentation next month and none of the skirt + nice blouse outfits I usually wear are formal enough. I always have a really hard time finding tops that will fit right, but I've never had as much trouble finding something as I had with this stupid jacket. None of the stores with nice suits carried anything larger than a size 16, which fit well across the shoulders but were all still way too tight across my chest. So I went to the plus size sections of the department stores, but those had almost no selection in anything below a size 20, and they were enormous in the shoulders and waist, and horrible quality. Even if I got them tailored, the cuts were not at all flattering and the material looked super cheap. 

After about six stores that had nothing that even came close to fitting, I *finally* found one at Lane Bryant. It isn't exactly the style I would have chosen had there been any other options, but it fits across the shoulders, it fits properly around my boobs, and it still gives me a defined waist when it's buttoned. 

The jacket I ended up buying was a size 16, the same size as all of the major brands that didn't have any boob room. If pants can come in long and short, why can't tops come with options like flat or curvy? Some brands of pants are sold by waist and inseam sizes, but jackets still only come in standard sizes. People's torsos vary in size just as much as people's legs do, but there is no effort to sell things based on that, and it makes shopping one of the most frustrating things that I do. I hate it.

Over the past few years I have gained a bit of weight and my chest exploded. I was shoving my tits into a 36DD bra for what seemed like forever. 

Yesterday I had enough. I sucked up my pride and went to a REAL LINGERIE store, owned by a woman who had been properly fitting bras since the beginning of time. 

I went in, she told me to undress down to my bra, and then a miracle happened, she shook my tits into a 40G and I felt better than ever. What I thought were lifeless bags of fat turned back into my perky 23 year old tits. This is awesome. I feel better than ever and it was incredibly dumb that I felt so self conscious as to let a little weight turn me away from wearing properly fitting clothing.

After snapping my 'kind of fitting' (meaning it covered my nipples and it hurt a fraction less than free-boobin' it) 30E (and shamefully having to wear a 32D) while my bra order was on it's way (I measured 26H-HH on the MWB chart and knew I needed new bras so ordered 5 in 26 and 28 bands, G+ cups) I desperately went to a local boutique (Hobart, Tasmania, Australia) which I knew stocked up to 30Gs, looking for a near-fit 28 or small 30 band in F/FF/G to have taken in by my seamstress. The owner who I usually get fitted by was not there. 

I asked for 30Fs or 28FFs to start off with, if they had any. After popping into the changeroom, getting my UB measured - I said 'My underbust is 63cm, or 61cm snug. At least 89cm over.' (correct, she measured me as 62cm under) She popped away and then returned.

First bra she handed me ([Evollove Sweet Blush](http://www.bendonlingerie.com.au/brands/evollove/evollove-sweet-blush-contour-bra-white)) I went to put it on - and saw that the cups were really small. I continued to put the bra on, and then laughed at the mirror. *My nipples were almost busting out...* Turns out she actually brought me a **30DD** instead of a 30F. She said '***I didn't think you would fill an F cup***'. By this point I was getting frustrated. I said 'I haven't even swooped and scooped. Do you think your associate could also take a look at this?' Commence the other lady observing. She said 'It's too big in the back, you need a smaller band size.' [*no shit, it was riding up 2 inches by that point*] 'The gores (the *middle* bit) float (meaning *come away from the body*) sometimes, and it doesn't matter if the wire presses on your boob a little bit at the sides. If it doesn't hurt it's fine.'

I simply said 'I need at least an F cup. If you don't have one, that's fine, just tell me. I've got places to be so I should probably be leaving now anyway.' (blatant lie, I just needed to get out of there before I started yelling at their severe lack of knowledge)

I got her to put my name down in the book to email if any 28FF or Gs came in. I have no idea what she wrote down. *I am ashamed for have recommending people close to me to visit that boutique* after I had great recommendations on sizing and styles from the owner. The owner told me honestly to order 28s or 26s if I could find them, in anywhere from a G to H. This boutique may stock sizes 28-46 AA-FF, but these two barely stocked a gram of knowledge between them.

I visited Myer afterwards and tried on the Evollove Bird Song Contour. Turns out I filled a 30G cup wise. Happily wearing a 26H now that my order has arrived."	t5_2ubfr	True

My best friend had told me about a huge sale at the local Lasenza Express. So slightly-naive teenage me just assumed they'd have my size. Nope.

I walked in to the store alone, my mom was in a different one with my brother. There were two girls working. Both very small bra sizes I'm sure. They both glared at me &amp; didn't acknowledge me otherwise. After ten minutes of searching for a bra that fits, (32 DD here) I finally asked for help. 

What size?

32 DD 
 
Oh, here's one. *hands freshtildeath a 32 D*

No, 32 DD.

*looks at co worker and laughs* 

Oh we don't have that size.

It was at that point I walked out of the store. NO ONE has the right to laugh at another woman's bra size. ESPECIALLY not a self conscious teenager. I went home and I cried. Which isn't unusual, I usually cry after bra shopping. I haven't visited Lasenza since.

After this, I went to a drugstore to fill the prescription that I got. The pharmacy staff did not mention this either. It was only one of the cashiers, who I know from a social group I used to be a part of, that had the nerve to tell me that it was there.

To be honest, I'm less annoyed that I could not see the sticker under my boobs and more annoyed that no one bothered to tell me. Did they just not notice it? Or did they not have the courage to mention it to me?

I'd seen the MyWifeBusty guide so many times, but since I'd been convinced that I was wearing the right size, I never bothered measuring myself. Well, I finally did, and realized that I was several cup sizes off, and it was time to get at least one new bra. Last weekend, I made a trip to Nordstrom with my mother. 

Shopping with my mother is never fun. 

This rant isn't about my experience at Nordstrom. It was fantastic there. I was blown away at their size selection. Never before had I gone bra shopping, and seen sizes that went above an E. The attendant was wonderful, fitted me perfectly (to a 34HH), showed me why my old bra (a 34DDD) did not work for me, and I left the store with [this lovely bra](http://www.panache-lingerie.com/superbra-by-panache/collection/21540681/Full-Cup-Bra). I'm still amazed. I've never worn a bra that fit like this before and gave me so much support. 

So my trip to Nordstrom was a success. It's my mother I'm ranting about. She's always angry that I can't fit into ""cute"" clothes because my boobs won't fit properly in there, and the entire shopping trip always turns into a tirade of ""Disgruntled_Badger, you know if you lost weight, you'd be prettier and be able to wear prettier clothes. This doesn't fit either? Your boobs are too big. I'd love to get these clothes for you if you fit in them. Oh well.""

It's always sucked. I've always been self conscious about my breasts because of it. I wore baggy clothes trying to hide them, and began to slouch because it would cover them better. I've dealt with this my entire life, and I stopped doing my shopping with her. And recently, *out of the blue* she began to tell me that I looked good just the way I was. This freaked me out. I've never heard this from her before in my entire life. But you know what, it felt *good*, finally being validated by my own mother. I was happy. 

So this entire time, my mother thought I was a 34DDD. And I guess that was fine to her. My breasts looked good. I looked good. And *suddenly*, as soon as I'm fit properly, and I explain to her that I need a 34HH bra, she's pissed.

My breasts look good, but as soon as you stick a two-digit number and a letter on them, they're outrageous. Suddenly, they're not fine anymore. Suddenly, they've turned into these monstrous, 50 pound boobs. I mean, excuse me. They are the *same* exact boobs that you were telling me looked good. They have a different letter on them, and now you've changed your mind? Now they're too big, *again?*

As we were leaving, I tried to reason with her. I told her, ""Mom, I don't think I'm that fat. But if these are the way my breasts are, and if they're just this large, then what am I supposed to do about it?""

I want you guys to know that this was the first time I've ever said aloud ""I'm not that fat"". All these years, she'd drilled into my head that big boobs = fat. I know better now. I know it's different with each person. 

But she turned to me, and said, ""You think you're not fat? I want you to look at yourself sometime, and say that again.""

While we walked to the car, she went on, asking me what my problem was. Didn't I want to wear cute bras and clothes? Did I really want to be stuck wearing ""ugly, old-people bras"" for my entire life? Why do I do this to myself? Why do I do this to her? 

At that point, I told her to please stop talking. I didn't want to hear it. I was too upset, and I wasn't in the mood to keep listening to her through the car ride home. We went bra shopping three days ago. She's indeed stopped talking, and hasn't talked to me since then. She's limited our conversations to ""Welcome back home, how was school, do you want dinner?"" *She's* mad at *me*, though I can't think of what I'd done wrong, aside from being big-boobed.  I've already gone back to trying to talk to her normally, but she's still distant. I'm not apologizing, because I hadn't said anything to her. 

Anyway. Sorry, girls. I just needed to get that off my chest. I'm still upset about everything. The whole bra shopping experience was ruined because of my mother's interference, and her cattiness has made the past three days difficult. I talk to my older brother about everything, but I know that his sister's boobs are a subject he cares little for.

tl;dr: Bra shopping was a success; realized how important the alphabet is to my mom.

I think it's probably an attitude passed down from my mother, but I've always thought of the word ""boobs"" as being slightly vulgar (though harmless), like something a boy in middle school would call them. Besides, when I hear someone say ""boobs"" I imagine something gelatinous and heavy jiggling about - like a bag of milk-flavored Jello. Personally I like to call them ""tits"" because it makes them sound small and perky, but I generally don't because, well, they're not. ""Breasts"" sounds really formal and anatomical (like ""vagina"") - which is fine, but you wind up sounding very formal. I usually just say ""my chest"" or ""my chests"", which is pretty comfortable.

1351963038.0	12kjwz	One of my health care providers just cited Howard Stern when trying to talk me out of a breast reduction.	coy_polloi	37	8	8	"It was my (male) psychopharmacist. I have been thinking about getting a reduction for a while, and a few weeks ago I decided to get the ball rolling by talking to my general physician, my counselor, and the guy who prescribes my meds. I felt like I needed to check in with the latter two just in case the insurance companies needed evidence that I was of sound mind (I am on meds for depression, which I don't see as a big deal but they might consider it grounds for rejecting my case. That's how it went when I was on the NHS in the UK).

Anyway, the first two supported my decision, and so did my psychopharmacist the first time around (let's call him Dr. P). He was awkward about it like he is about everything else, but  he basically said that he didn't see why not. Then when I went back to see him a month later, he tells me that he'd been listening to the Howard Stern show on the way to work, and they were talking about breast reduction surgery. One of the people on the show wanted to get one (for reasons familiar to many of us here), but the whole cast of the show was trying to talk her out of it, including one woman there who'd already had one. [Here's the link, if you're interested](http://www.examiner.com/article/howard-stern-show-highlights-kelsey-breast-reduction-debate). He told me that it got him thinking and that I should really think about it and make sure it was what I wanted, because they said on the radio that it could change the shape in a negative way, and if I already had an OK shape I should probably just wait on it. I do **not** have an OK shape, but I really, *really* did not want to keep talking about my breasts with him, so I let it drop.

Ive been with my larger-bust girlfriend for.. Approaching a year now. When we had first met and started dating, her bras were older but not yet needing to be replaced. 

Fast forward to this last week, when we were finally replacing her last one which was becoming just shreds.. She asked me to go along with her, and attempting to be the considerate boyfriend, I agreed to.

1) We found out she had become a 36HH, up from a (EDIT: 36FF, not DD). ( at her last professional fitting )

This was a shock, and a bit of teasing ensued. We knew that they had gotten larger, but not by *that* much.

The shop, even being a decent sized store with wall-to-wall bra's, still did not have cups that large readily available. I was outside the fitting room, and was amused to see the staff frantically check for anything they could.

Eventually they found three different types, she tried them and we walked out with two.

Speaking of two.

2) Prices. Dear lawd, I felt that sting. She had enough to purchase one bra, but as the shop was an hour away, we wanted to get two of them so I agreed to loan her the money for it. I think they cut her a deal for $135 for two bras, down from a regular $160? 


She had warned me of this, but actually hearing the numbers ( and looking at that little bundle of fabric ) made my head spin. But I have seen just how signifigant of a difference a proper fitting bra has made in just the last few days since her purchasing it."	t5_2ubfr	True

So, the other day I made the horrible mistake of asking my mom to take me to get a sports bra.

After trying on about six different bras, from 36D to 40DD (U.S.) at Kmart and listening to my mom blab about my boobs in the middle of the store to my aunt, I finally just begged her to take me home and we left. 

Today, we decided to go to the mall. After walking around inquiring about jobs, I reconnected with my mom and my oldest brother's girlfriend. My mom goes, ""Oh, we should get you fitted while we're here!"" I say okay (even though I really didn't want to after the sports bra experience). First, we go to JC Penny, but there's no fitter available so they hunt me down some bras to try on. 

I try on a 34DD. No luck. Okay, a 36D. Still no luck. Let's try this, a 36DD. LOL NOPE. 

Okay, we're done at JC Penny's. Onward to find my bro's Christmas present. 

Mom: ""Well, let's go to VS and get you measured!"" 

Oh no. Oh hell fucking no. 

What do I end up doing? Going to VS and getting measured. 

They size me at a 38D. According to the size chart here on Reddit, I'm a 34G (That one is a UK). 

Okay, whatever. Head back to where my mom is at. She decides she wants to get measured, head back to VS, find SAME attendant. 

Guess what they put my mom at? 38D. Now, I know looks can be deceiving, but she is not as big as I am. 

I'm so tired of this. I want to cry. My chest hurts, I'm sick of clothes not fitting, my back hurts, my shoulders hurt. I'm starting up school again and I'm going to have all the freshman boys ogling my tits AGAIN. 

As soon as I started getting big in my chest, boys who had previously made fun of me for being awkward and shit were suddenly asking me out. I eventually found a boy who loves me for me. When I tell him he's just dating me for boobs, he's come up with line and says,""Nah, those are just... (cue light boob squeeze) perks!"" Gets me to giggle every time. 

Now, they're talking about driving all the way out to Fredericks of Hollywood or however you spell it to get me measured.

I don't want to feel ashamed and like a freak because of my bra size!

First spoke to my doctor about it when I was 15, at a 28JJ and I was told to wait until they stopped growing.

At 16 they stopped at my current size when I was 60 kilos (about 130 lbs). At 5' 2"" that gave me a BMI of 23.7. I was told to lose weight to see if they would shrink. Of course the stress and body dysmorphia turned that into an eating disorder.

Currently I weigh 45 kilos (100 lbs), BMI of 18, and I'm about to turn 17 in a few weeks. After an appointment I've now been told that I can't have the surgery until I've had children.

My mother was big chested too, and she recently got a reduction due to back pain, I think she used to squeeze into a 38DD and now she's a B/C. I think the problem was that she wasn't wearing the correct fitting bra. Now why is this my problem? Well the first problem is: since the reduction, she's seemed to completely forget what it's like to be big boobed. She's completely insensitive about how I feel about my boobs. She's tried making me wear wired bras to bed. And then there's the problem of the bra's I have. 

Right now, I have 2 bra's that are the 36D's that I described before. Now, before I found this and the proper way to fit a bra (4 months ago), I had gotten 4 new bras, one is weird and makes my boobs spread out on my chest, and just feels like my boobs are just hanging. There's another that was a push up (but one of those that is 'smaller' for bigger cups) and it's got parts that rub me raw. I don't wear either of them, except the first one that I use with gym under a sports bra.

My mother will not buy me any bra's that actually fit, and she certainly won't be open to the idea of ordering some online. Her bra source is Walmart of Target. That being said, she asked me why my band was so high on my back, and all I could say was that it wasn't that big of a deal. It's that high because I'm trying to get the band in the proper place by tightening the straps. But still my bra 'floats' on my boobs and the gore is never on my breastbone. 

Any ideas for how to get my mother to wise up on bra fitting, or at least let her buy me new bras? I've been thinking of actually breaking my bras and/or buying my own while out with friends. 

Edit: So I measured my self and got 32 DDD/F(US) and E(UK). Also, thank you fro the kind offers, but I wouldn't be able to get any bras from other people because my mother would ask where all these packages with bras in them came from and I wouldn't be able to give a good answer.

Now, anyone who has gone to a rock/metal/punk/alternative festival knows that when you go in to see a band, if you want to be anywhere near the front, you mosh, you shove, you get shoved and generally are moving all over the place. 

My boobs allowed me to push people in front of me away (the perks of having fairly insensitive breasts), and they were amazing for getting through crowds. Also, as I went in with only my phone, ID and some money, it went all went into a small phone case, and into the bra. It worked amazingly well. I even forgot it was there on occasion. 

The downside was that I got groped and hugged by lots of strangers, and trying to get into the mosh of one of the bands, the guy behind me used me and my boobs as a battering ram (that really hurt). Also, they didn't have any shirts in the female cut that would fit me.

All of my friends are within the B-C cup range and have no problem walking into a LaSenza or Victoria's secret and walking out with a bra. I used to wear 34DD from those places but my boobs always seemed to peek out from the bottoms and over the tops of the bras..it was super uncomfortable.

Anyways so last year I went to a Toronto store called Change, and the lady there was awesome and I bought 2 bras that actually fit!! I ended up being sized at 34H. The bras were super comfy and supportive. When I told my friends my size they looked so shocked and almost gave me a look of pity at being an H (I honestly don't care what cup size I am, as long as it fits). 

So anyways, I ended up going back to the store about 2 weeks ago because my boobs have grown AGAIN! I was excited because my last experience had been so good. But this time honestly sucked. They didn't have any of my sizes in the bras I wanted (I want more of a t-shirt bra) and the sizes they did have were only super lace or push up bras (which I really don't need). A different lady picked some sizes for me and they sucked. The band was not feeling right and the cups too small; the band was so far away from my chest and my boobs were super squished together falling out of the cup. I showed the saleslady and mentioned that the band of the bra wasn't sitting against my chest, and she said ""Oh, that's fine! It's perfectly normal for bigger chested womens bras not to touch the chest/under the boob"". I just looked at her like wtf, because I know that's NOT right. I didn't end up buying anything, and when I got home I went on bravissimo &amp; ordered a bra from there. I'm just so angry that I can't get the bras I need close to home and I have to resort to ordering bras internationally (and I really hope it fits when it gets here).

Off I went on my bra hunt. Got frustrated at all the max sizes being D's, but hey whats new!

I ended up finding a large sizes department, and went to try them on, grabbed a few 36GGs and headed to the fitting room. Oh dear god. felt like I was attempting to bind my boobs. I had double boob going on and the bra wasn't anywhere near my breast bone.

This was a mistake.

I got a bad feeling as soon as I walked over to the lingerie section and saw not only no one working there, but also no fitting rooms. I ignored it, and started picking through the racks just looking for cups big enough to possibly be mistaken for a hat. There was nothing. Not a Wacoal or anything remotely useful in sight. All they had were Bali bras, up to a 40D, and some misshapen Playtex bras that looked like they might have gone up to a DD. Their sports bras were the arbitrary S, M, L, etc, and a 34 band only came in S and XS. I finally found an employee and asked if they carried larger cup sizes, and she brushed me off with a ""Sometimes Playtex sends us a DDD by mistake."" and a look that made it clear that I was wasting her time. One of her coworkers was standing there and politely asked what size I was looking for. When I told her at least an H cup, she immediately just stared at my chest, speechless, and slowly said that they had some plus size camis with built-in bras that might help. I tried not to laugh, since she'd been nice (really, I did!) but I couldn't help myself. I then thanked her for her time, and went a few stores down to Deb's, where I attempted to try on a pair of jeans that should have fit my waist, but I'll never know because I couldn't get them past my ass.

One girl chimes in with, ""What are you? a D? I am pretty sure they carry those."" So I chuckle and say, ""Actually, I am an F or double FF. Most mainstream stores don't carry my size.""

Another girl at the table literally freaks out because she has never heard of a FF before and she starts saying how she didn't know there was even a size bigger than a DD. I asked her what she assumed large breasted women wear and she said that she's never seen a person that would need larger than a DD before so she's never thought about it (meanwhile, I, who is a 36FF, is sitting directly across the table from her.)

This just made me super annoyed and I felt like I was a weird freak show that they were all staring at in amazement. The girl who was getting very flustered about this new information told me she wears a 36C. Meanwhile, from my experience, I would say she is easily a DD or larger.

It happened a few times, including once when we were all out for a birthday dinner, which sparked a 10 minute conversation between 5 people talking about MY boobs right in front of me like I was some carnival side show! All I could think of was that all this hard work and effort I went through to look pretty and put together was a complete waste; now no one will notice anything else aside from my boobs all night.

Around the 3rd or 4th time, I finally broke down and ended up crying in my friend's room for about 20 minutes, only to have her roommate come in and ""apologize"" since she didn't really understand why I was upset, and then have her boyfriend shut her up when she tried to explain why ****ing huge was a compliment.

I'm mature enough to realize that from her point of view (an easy 32B) saying someone's boobs are big must be a good thing, because she wants bigger boobs (and has told all of us quite a few times). However, I don't believe there is any situation where saying some woman's assets are crazy big is ever going to be a compliment to anyone, EVER!!

I don't run around saying ""wow, your ass looks HUGE in that"" or anything of the sort. A good old fashioned ""nice"" or ""flattering"" would suffice, so why is this so hard to imagine for larger breasted women? It is possible that many of us are super insecure about ourselves and comments like that are most DEFINITELY not helping.

This is going to get some getting used to obviously, as I'm 32G (probably bigger as even that feels too small) on an average frame. Also, it will take a lot of motivation to keep going because this is something society disapproves of. I'm sure I'll get a few outraged looks as I parade my big boobs around town with my nipples showing through. Well, I'm not going to apologize for being a woman and for the breasts nature gave me. 

I understand that for many women in this sub, bras are a lifesaver once they find the right size. However, bras are extremely expensive, and I've already spent far too much money on bras that fit the first few days and then lose their shape or start hurting. I am tired of this quest for *the bra that fits*, and more and more I become convinced that I will never find it. After all, my breasts change sizes all the time, with hormonal changes, weight changes, etc. so I do not think that I have a set size. Add to this the fact that my left boob is almost a cup bigger than my right boob, and finding a proper fitting bra looks next to impossible.

Finally, I've looked at many bra-free websites, including that of the French scientist who conducted the study, and it appears that in many cases, not wearing a bra *eliminated back and shoulder pain*. Now, I've been suffering from back and neck pain for years (I'm only 20!), and I think going bra-free is something that's at least worth trying since nothing else has worked.

If anyone else would like to partake in this experiment with me, I think it would be very helpful to have each other's support through this experience. 

I'm looking forward to hearing what you all think!

EDIT: So I've gone the whole day without wearing a bra, and so far so good. I went out to the grocery store and then to a friend's place, and it all went great! I even ran a little to catch my bus and experienced no pain. I did have some support though, not from a bra but from a spaghetti-strap tank top that has a supportive layer underneath.

1362498651.0	19plus	Swimwear: Must I choose between support or showing off my not so slim figure?	-Misla-	36	8	20	"So, it's only March, and I didn't really think I needed to bother with this until June-July, but now I may be going on a vacation in April, which it prompted me to start looking for some swimwear; I have a sporty swimsuit which I use for weekly laps, but I would like something a little more flatting, colorful and fun for the beach. 

So for the past hour or so, I have been looking all over. Freya, Panache, Elomi, Fantasie, Cleo, Curvy kate, Bravissimo.

And there seems to be two-three trends: 1) most of the offerings are bikinis - which in itself there is nothing wrong with, 2) the few swimsuits and tankinis there are, do not go as equally high in the cup as the binikis and/or the bandsizes start bigger. 3) This is more tast-related, but why a little to much cleavage in some?

* Fantasie: Swimsuits and Tankinis start at 34. Tankinis stop around GG.
* Freya: Bikinis go up to JJ, some tankinis to G, some to HH.
* Curvy Kate: offers full sizes in tankinis too, but only plain colour.
* Elomi: Yeah, they get the coverage, but their tankinis are based on a swimbra, which starts at 34.
* Panache: Yes, finally 30 back and up to J (their Holly swimsuit up to K, actually), some tankinis only to G.
* Bravissimo: Up to K, but only plain colours.
* Cleo: Bikinis up to J, tankinis up to G.

Maybe I'm just being picky and difficult, but I really think it is difficult to find something in my size, 30J/32HH.

I am never ever going to wear a bikini: My tommy is not slim, neither am I, and a bikini top and a bottom would just cut me off at the worst places for my figure. Isn't it enough that I already have to show of my granny over-arms and my thighs when I want to go swimming?!

I am not trying to look sexy when at the beach, I am just trying to find something more colourful and fun than my Speedo Swimsuit. It's not about a modesty-thing, I was raised pretty hippie-y, it's about wanting to look at least the best I can when wearing that little clothing.

My hips is also bigger than my upper body, making a tankini the preferable choice, as you can so much easier make the sizes fit.

Maybe the real reason for this mini-rant is that I have fallen in love with something, that isn't available in my size:
The [Tilly by Cleo](http://www.figleaves.com/uk/product/CL-CW0011/Cleo%20by%20Panache-Tilly-Underwired-Bandeau-Tankini-Dress/?product_id=CL-CW0011&amp;linkid=fig_uk_oiir).
I am seroiusly considering buying it in 30G and see just how incredibly bad it would be, or a 34G and taking the band in, as if that is even possble. :'( I am love-struck.

So - what do others with smaller bandsizes and bigger than GG/bigger than HH cups do for swimwear?

Well if they don't look like your grandmas old underwear or are incredibly boring, they have an astounding amount of push up! like we don't have enough boob material allready!

1344540996.0	xyee9	I just had a *good* bra shopping experience!	Katiroth	30	2	17	"I'm at the smaller end of the big boob spectrum, with my last fitting showing me at 38DD. I had it done at Victoria's Secret, and I -squeezed- into those damn bras, I think mostly because that's the largest size they carry, and they wanted to make a sale. Since then, I've worn the two I bought there, along with super cheap wal-mart bras that -really- didn't fit well (As they weren't even my actual size). Cue the underwire breaking in one VS bra, and the underwire constantly poking me in the other VS bra..and of course, the wal-mart cheapies lasting a very short time.

So yesterday, given that I was making a trip to the BIG CITY (I live 2.5 hours from the closest mall-- go go rural Missouri!), I stopped by Nordstrom, as I remember hearing on this subreddit that it was pretty decent when it came to bras..and of course, the last thing I wanted to do was hit Victoria's Secret again.

Within just a few seconds of looking through the bra racks, there was someone to help me. She asked what size I was looking for, and I replied with ""40 DD."" (thinking I was needing the larger band, since the VS one hurt) She then looked at me a moment and asked what size I was wearing, and I told her 38DD, but it was really uncomfortable in the band now. She started to help me look for pretty 40DD bras, but when I mentioned it was a VS bra, she picked out another 38DD, and asked me try it on.

It fit beautifully. Perfectly. It was comfortable, it looked good-- only problem, it was that ugly peach color, and I am so sick of ugly bras that it's not even funny. Plus it was 70 dollars-- and while I'm willing to spend that on a good bra, I really, really didn't want to.

""Ooh, hold on!"" says the lady, who checks something in her computer. ""The black ones are on clearance right now...oh, we don't have that size in stock. ...Can we ship it to you instead?""

45 dollars for a good bra? Just have to wait an extra two days? HELL YEAH!

The whole experience was great. I didn't feel like I was ""too fat"" to be shopping there, like I had felt at VS. I felt like it was no big deal, asking for a size that wasn't a B or C cup. The saleswoman went out of her way to make sure I didn't pay more than I had to, and treated me like a valued customer-- which, again, was something I really didn't feel like at VS.

Living in the middle of nowhere, I don't have a lot of options when it comes to actual stores I can buy bras from, much less quality ones, and considering the same size can fit so drastically different, I'm hesitant to buy online. And again, I know I'm at the smaller end of the big boob spectrum, so my experience may differ from others...but damn, did it feel good to have a normal, good day of bra shopping."	t5_2ubfr	True

1375075941.0	1j9dib	[RANT] I'm angry that I'm only now in a properly fitted bra	chiodos	31	5	15	"I hit puberty fairly young, I'd say I was about 9. It was noticeable, so I stood out. I got teased, bullied, etc for being the only one my age/grade having breasts at the time. Because of this, I have always been rather self-conscious of my body and breasts. I did my best to hide my body since I was so uncomfortable in it.

I started out with a few 'training bras' and went straight from that to a 34C (when I was about 11 or 12 maybe?). I remember getting fitted, and the woman fitting me tell my mom and I that I was a ""big girl"" for my age, and kept making all these comments about my chest that made me rather uncomfortable. I began to hide myself even more, not wanting to draw anymore attention to myself or my chest.

Eventually, when I grew out of the awkward teenager phase (at 15 or so) I began feeling a bit more comfortable and confident with myself. I did not feel as ugly or awkward. I realized I was spilling out of my bras, so I went with my mom to try and find some new ones. I'm from Canada, so the typical lingerie stores around here are ones such as La Senza, Aerie or La Vie En Rose. All of which are similar to Victoria Secret. I went and was fitted, and was told I was a 34D. I tried some on, and realized it was too small. The sales woman was sure that I couldn't be any larger than that, and so was my mom. They practically refused to allow me to try them on, and since my mom was the one paying, I went with it and stuck with the 34D's. 

I wore them for about two years until I got so fed up with the constant spillage that I went back on my own to be fitted. Since I had bought those bras, I had grown quite a bit and been on and off of various medications which made me both gain weight and made my breasts larger. I got fitted at a similar store as before, and learned that the biggest bra in a 34 they had was a DD. I tried it on, and it felt better than my old bras, but still did not fit. I had a breakdown when I could not find a bra that actually fit, especially when I was fitted and told I would be able to wear a 34DD. I felt like a freak, and was frustrated that I was going to be so uncomfortable in my new bras. 

A few months after buying those, I discovered this subreddit, along with /r/ABraThatFits and my life was changed. I learned how to find your size on your own, and found out I am likely a 32GG. Holy shit. That size exists?! I could not believe it. For one, I did not know that bras were that large. I don't know how I thought other women with breasts bigger than mine wore bras, but I just couldn't believe it. I also was surprised I was a 32, because I had *always* been a 34. I was so relieved to know that bras in my size actually existed!

After discovering my true size, I was set out to find some to try on. But, like I said before, there aren't a lot of places to buy bras like that. Everywhere I had been before did not have my size. I started researching things, asking questions, and eventually made progress on finding bras that fit. I currently own properly fitted bras, and it is the most amazing feeling ever. I cried when I tried on my first properly fitted bra for the first time and was able to wear it for the day and not fall out/be comfortable the entire day in it!

I do get angered quite a bit about all this though... I wish it wasn't so hard to find/afford these bras. I wish I had known about this earlier. I want to help all my friends and make sure they are in the right size too! I'm also annoyed because my breasts are [""omega shaped""](http://www.herroom.com/breast-shape,336,30.html) which is apparently the result of poorly fitted bras! I just don't understand why being *properly* fitted isn't the norm. I really wish it was. It would have saved me years of stress and anxiety over my body.

Sorry for the long rant, but I have been needing to vent. Thank you for reading. 

edit: I would also like to say a thank you to /u/spitzsunflower who donated six or so of her old bras to help me get out of my 34DD's! She gave me a few ranging from 32FF to 34DDD. All of which were a 1000x better than my ratty old ones, and definitely helped with my confidence!"	t5_2ubfr	True

It was actually [this](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=95248&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351580002) dress here from GAP where other people were saying that the bust was way too tight and they had to size up.  :/

I went to a couple other stores and was quite shocked that I wasn't a L or XL in top sizes.  I'm wearing a medium button down right now. I went to the mall and shopped in the medium section of stores for shirts and it was like some weird twilight zone of things fitting.  It was really freaking me out.  

But then I went to H&amp;M and even their largest shirt sizes couldn't contain me, upon which everything was right with the world.

1366489985.0	1cre17	A rant I've needed to say for a while	ifangirlatnight	30	3	8	"OK, so I'm 15 years old and a 32G (UK), I've had big boobs since I was 12/13 and have always got a lot of attention for them. The only way I can hide them is in hoodies 2-3 sizes to big which make me feel swamped by material. I'm tall and a healthy weight so the rest of my body is pretty average - which just seems to draw more attention to the boobs. My face isn't particularly amazing but I wouldn't say it's really ugly either; it wouldn't draw much attention basically.
 I know it probably sounds stupid or petty but I HATE it when people compliment my boobs or when they're the first thing people notice. Everyone seems to think they are being nice when they tell me how ""amazing"" my big boobs are and I get that, really I do. But when they say it I don't feel ""hot"" or ""amazing"". I feel like I'm just a body carrying around this pair of boobs for everyone to stare at. 
  
Example- the other day I was with a few friends who were planning to go out that afternoon. One of them is a bi guy who has taken the role of ""sassy gay friend"" (note he himself built up this image because he enjoys it, it's not some crappy stereotyping). He mentioned something along the lines of ""Only gorgeous people like myself can be seen"" causing us all to laugh. Then he pointed at a few of us and said we should probably bring some paper bags if we're next to him (he's not a douche he's just funny) and pointed to another saying she was fine. To me he said ""You'll pass as long as you show of your tits."". Now I KNOW he was joking and that he doesn't think any of us are ugly and that everyone though he comment was funny but I still felt bad. I would have been fine if I was with the group he said needed a bag but the implication that my boobs are the single good thing about my hit to close to home and I admit it hurt.
 But it's not just that my friends constantly joke and talk about my boobs that I dislike. It's the strangers who just stare. Now I'm not talking about people who glance for a second then look away sheepishly. I'm talking about open glaring at them from across the road. While there's probably more guys than women staring they're not a particularly large majority. However the guys vary in age from about 12-70 and when I see a typical man in his late 30s staring I feel really dirty. A lot of the time with women (and of course some men) it's not even sexual; the best way of describing it is how some old people stare at tattooed, pierced guys with blue hair. Like I'm disgusting and trying too hard for them to notice me.
  It's worth mentioning that I'm by no means a ""slut"". I don't have the body confidence or want the attention it brings. My tops are fitted not skin-tight. I can't wear high necks because it draws more attention to the two lumps covered by straining fabric; however I don't try to show miles of cleavage either. I wear a little make-up when I go out, maybe some eye-liner, mascara and lipstick, but I don't wear so much to make me look older. With my boobs and all I probably do appear older than I am to people I don't know but I refuse to believe I look over 17. My friends tell me it's not other peoples fault they think I'm old enough to stare at my chest, but it's not my fault either!!

Lately been having more issues buying bras than I'd like and my boyfriend suggested this sub-reddit. I thought he was crazy as I didn't think I'd ""qualify"" for it for some reason. Using the sidebar I've sized myself at 34 FF - 34 G and realized that places like La Senza will size you into what they carry as opposed to what you are, which a big contributor to the problem of people not wearing the right size.

Now I'm looking for my real size and found a store to verify it, but the bras were SO expensive. Tried looking at department or popular bra stores and all the DD or sometimes DDD only come in band sizes of 38 and above for the larger cups. 

Looking at the size I am and talking to friends/family it seems that many people are cup sizes larger than the DD that stores carry, so why is it that regular stores do not carry the ""larger"" cup sizes with smaller bands?!
My sister is running into this problem now too. She was sized at 32D and now that she's preggers she's been told she's swelled to an I, but I have a feeling she wasn't a D to start with. Either way she can't even find maternity bras in the maternity stores! That seems so ridiculous to me.

On the issue of bras, the other day I went to a department store to buy a bra in their big sale, it's winter over here so  I wanted something big, comfortable and fugly. The kind of utility bra that provides support, but no frills. I looked through heaps of bras and tried heaps on, and the only one that fit me properly was bright red lace concoction that looks like something you'd find in a bad 18th century themed porno. I was really pissed of by this. 
Maybe other busty ladies had the same idea and got there before me and bought up all the comfy beige sports bras (the only ones I could find that were even close to my size were garish and quite provocative) but I kinda feel like that's a bit of a stretch. The message I took from this visit, is  if you have boobs my size, you have to want to look like some pornographic fantasy, your boobs must be encased in red lace and little black bows. You have to want to look like a whore, because you are a whore.
 
However if you have small ones, you can get sexy bras, elegant bras, cute bras, sports bras, fugly bras, barely there bras, themed bras, funky bras... the list goes on. WHY. I need some variation up in here.

So, after arguing with my mother in the car on the way to Wal Mart, she brought up that she found a new way to measure. I was like, ""Okay, we'll try this."" Now, I am a very modest girl, and I don't even like being naked in front of my own family. Hell, I can't walk around the house without a bra on. So I brought up about having to be naked, and she said, ""No, you just have to have a bra on."" 

Seriously? Okay, fine. I try to find the measuring tape and no luck, so arming myself with my cat and the links that I need, I brought up several tabs of information. In particular, the band/cup relative size stuff. I went out and went through all of the information with her.

Nope, she still doesn't believe me. Not one damn little bit. "	t5_2ubfr	True

*movement - I stripped off my shirt, stood in front of the mirror and bounced in my regular bra.  I then put on my new bra and did the same.  Some comments I'd read said there was NO movement, but ... I'll just say my girls are pretty controlled.  I was hoping for better :(  

*I hate the uni-boob look it gave me.  When I was in the car I was having trouble with my seat belt staying in place.  Very annoying.  

*Getting the thing on was a work out in itself.  Had to hook the top set of hooks and pull it over my head with difficulty.  Then ""arrange"" the girls.  Then hooked the bottom set of hooks.  

*Once I was all in there...it felt good.  Secure.  Love the racer back.  Haven't worn one in years.  Feels good on the shoulders.

*Once I was at the gym I really checked myself out in the mirrors.  The girls were nice and high; right where they are supposed to be.  I guess due to how the racer back holds/supports the girls...I look like I actually have shoulders.  

*I only did strength training yesterday but I felt very comfortable.  Actually had this thought...""I would feel comfortable without a shirt on.""  

*overall I'm pleased with the bra.  It's not a great as I expected but well worth the investment.  Although I think I try a different style/brand next time.

1346607000.0	z8jni	So apparently I'm 'trashy'?	LimitlessSkies	35	8	23	"Was reading the paper this morning and came across a review of various underwear, reviewed by a 'real woman' wearing a 36C (Not only do I hate the phrase 'real woman'; just because I'm slim and have large breasts doesn't mean I'm not a real woman we are ALL real women. But she is also clearly not a 36C, get sized girl).

But i read the reviews anyway as I see she has reviewed on of my favourite brands ever, By Caprice. I LOVE this brand because I actually feel like they care about making big sizes look pretty. They have lovely moulded cups with subtle uplift padding and really girly patterns and styles. I ADORE the range as in a 32FF, bras like this are SO hard to find. I think they are pretty and make me feel so sexy.

But to my horror, this was her comment on the bra (Which in the A-DD sizes has gel rather than the padding) was this: 

MICHELLE SAYS: Only Caprice can pull off a set as garish as this. But I don’t feel very sexy in it. It may be every lads mag’s dream to see a girl trussed up like this, but I don’t think it’s sophisticated.

Caprice’s garish hot pink designs, from her By Caprice line, look more trashy than classy.

I felt like crying. I find a range of bras that is supportive and really pretty. They really make me feel GOOD! I FINALLY feel like someone cares about making big cup sized bras look really girly, sexy and with pretty designs and the first thing I see is someone saying they are trashy...

It's hard enough coping with the fact that most high street shops think we don't deserve nice underwear, without people saying one of the best brands I have found for me is 'trashy'.

The boyfriend has reassured me that I don't look tacky or trashy in them and that with the reviewer not being in the right size, not to listen to her. But my confidence has still taken a bit of a hit!

Its getting to that time where you need to wear light weight materials. At my place of work a lot of girls are wearing vest tops with a light weight cardigan. Ideal for summers when you still need to look respectful. 

But yesterday I wore a vest top to work, along with an elbow length and to my surprise was told to go home and change because ""i was showing too much""

This seemed very odd to me as i was surrounded by women dressed no different than me. The only difference was my breasts are a bit bigger than most of the girls in a office.

This is the first time I have encountered this but everywhere else I have worked I have had a uniform.

The past couple years, my nipples have become super sensitive. I wear a Deco most days and that doesn't bother me, but when I wear my seamed bras, I almost always wear a cami between my bra and the shirt, otherwise the friction is too much. Standing in the shower hurts. It hurts when my boyfriend touches them. They hurt when it's too cold out. They hurt while I'm putting my bra on. It hurts if I have no bra on and I catch a breeze.

I googled, but everything I came up with seemed to point to hormonal changes. But this started a couple years ago (so I think we can assume I haven't been secretly pregnant this whole time!). I'm on birth control, but I've been on the same exact kind for 8 years now. The only thing that's really changed is that I lost about 20 pounds, and I went down a cup size. I'd be surprised if going DOWN a cup size did this to me! They hurt all month long too, not just around my period. I've been using the same lingerie detergent for at least 6 years (Forever New). They are basically hard all the time, but I've always been that way and this is a fairly recent problem.

The size was 34H and I guess it fits (it passes all the tests), but I don't like the lift it gives. I've always worn at least slightly padded bikini tops because they give me better support and I just generally prefer the way I look in them. This one is ok, but not perfect. I would prefer to order a padded bikini next time.  

Now, the problem is that, judging from the picture featured on brastop, I thought that the bikini I was ordering was padded. Turns out, it isn't. I was just browsing their on-line store and I saw that most of the time, they don't even give this information and the picture is obviously misleading. I tried reading the customer reviews, but found nothing. I found just one bikini that they clearly stated was padded and that came in my size, but it was a bit out of my price range.

I_can_be_kittens_too	41	18	15	"April 2013 issue of Women's Health, to which I subscribe, has an article called ""The Guy Next Door"". This is where women submit their guy-related problems for advice. One woman wrote, ""I'm paranoid about my bfs attractive coworkers. Should I be?""
The response was sensible, in my opinion, until I read one line that said, ""if your relationship is going strong, it's going to take more than a busty coworker to derail it.""

I am very sensitive to the issue of categorizing large breasts with negative sexual behavior. Try replace the word ""busty"" with ""blonde"". Now it makes them seem like they're saying blonde woman are out there to steal your boyfriend. What makes it any more acceptable to say that about women with large breasts?

Your thoughts?

Edit: It's become more clear to me that the article was using the stereotype that men like large breasted women, not that busty women are man-stealers. Still, there's the issue that women tend to be wary of their bustier counterparts because of this stereotype, and the magazine is using this fact to ""add dramatic effect"" as u/Dysana puts it.

I've been fully aware that I was wearing the wrong size in a 44DDD from Lane Bryant, but the bras fit and I was okay with that.  Now I'm 15 weeks pregnant and my breasts grew at week 8.  I'm tired of popping out of my bras and the bras are hurting, I'm tired of it.

I knew I would have to order online because stores don't carry my size.  I decided to measure myself using the guide in the margin.  I measure at a 45"" underbust (yes, I really do, built with huge shoulders, overweight and 6' tall, please don't judge) and my breasts measure 59"" standing with my back parallel to the floor like the guide says.  I measured standing, just in case my breasts were a bit pendulous, and I got 56"" so maybe average would be 58""?  So according to the chart I'm a UK 44JJ (US 44N).

I can't even find that size in places I might have shopped before online.  I don't even know where to go.  I know most of the ladies here have a much smaller under-bust measurement than I do, I guess I'm just hoping I can find someone else like me who has found where to get bras.

Yes, I've been professionally fitted, and I've had professional bra fitters at two different shops say my size was 32G. But it just hurts. Not continually, but sometimes. If I lie down, or sit down in a comfy couch, or just try to relax, it hurts. 

So my question is: is this normal? People keep telling me it's not normal, but technically I'm wearing the right size bras, so what's up with that? It's the wires that are most disturbing, but I can't find a nice-looking wireless bra in my size.

Also, I have a lot of neck pain, and I'm wondering whether the two could be related. I have a normal weight for my height, so the boobs aren't really proportionate, so that probably doesn't help.

I'd never heard about migrated breast tissue until last week, when I found [this post on it](http://www.venusianglow.com/2009/09/get-rid-of-armpit-rolls-in-5-seconds.html). Those armpit and back rolls so many ladies complain about? A result of wearing poorly-fitting bras (small cups, HUGE band) for a long period of time. Apparently, the small cup squishes your breast tissue out the back of the cups into the armpit, and the loose band lets this tissue slip along your back! Eep!

1. Oh my god, my boobs have gotten that much bigger?!

2. (after looking at pictures of best friend who had ""big"" boobs and made fun of my small ones) She thought that was big?!

It's so funny to me how they've grown so much without me even realizing it...I thought I looked about a size bigger since before, people would eyeball me as ""B-cup"" and now I tend to get eyeballed as ""C-cup."" Maybe D-cup only when I wear a bikini because then people realize how much is padding and how much is actual boob. But nope, I definitely look three sizes bigger. I think the letter D just scares people or something.

And omg, my best friend! Her boobs were tiny! She used to brag about wearing a 34C and I seriously thought that was big...No offense to anyone passing through who wears 34C, it just seems so tiny in comparison to how big I thought I perceived it as. I just think it's hilarious how I perceived breast size and growth back then. I thought C-cups were big and I thought that I would be small-breasted forever. 

So I've decided. If I go to my high school reunion, I'm wearing the most low-cut scandalous top with a Freya Deco, maybe in a size too small. And if the ex-best friend is there, I'll find random reasons to bend over.

Just kidding, I would never use such nice girls for evil :)

She has frequent pain and though the doctors say they've never seen something like this, they think it's comparable to fibromyalga or something like that.

Never again. 	expulsus	27	2	14	"So after using several of the bra fitting guides that I have found thanks to you lovely ladies, I have discovered that I am a 36E, or 36F, depending on who's asking, I suppose. I've been wearing a 36C or 36D since I was about 16. That explains the pain I feel at the end of every day. Anyway, after learning that my breasts are larger than I thought (gotta love that migrating breast tissue!), I went to my local mall to see if I could find something that fit me.

I first went into Frederick's of Hollywood at the direction of my awesome hair lady. They were very nice and helpful, but the bra that fit best (a 36DDD) was way too frivolous and sexy for every day life, and there was too much lacy and ribbon and all that jazz. The lady in there very kindly pointed me in the direction of Soma, saying that they carry my size. Cool.
So I walked into the Soma and was offered help by a girl in there about my age. She asked me what size, and I told her. She (very rudely) informed me that ""just visually"", there is no way I could possibly be an E cup. She asked me where I got the measurement (several websites), who did the measuring (my sister), is she a professional bra fitter (no, are you? (""I worked at VS before and now I work here, so I know what I'm doing"")), etc. Whatever, I need a bra. So she measures me (wrongly) and puts me in a 34C. Guess what. I'm falling the fuck out. She just kind of blows off the quad-boob effect and asks me if my ""breasts are even real."" I wish I could say that I stormed out of there, but in the end I felt very pressured to buy a bra and run out of there so that I wouldn't be late to class. I get home and try on the bra that I purchased (a 36D), and guess what? It didn't fit. I returned the bra, and the woman that I returned it to was a bit snotty as well.
I will not be returning to Soma, like ever. 

Long story short, I just purchased two bras from FigLeaf.com and am very excited to receive the hopefully life-changing pieces of underwear.

I just needed to rant. Who are you, strange lady, to decide what bra size I am just ""visually""? Bitch.

Being a 34G, it is extremely difficult to find tops that fit both my bust and my waist well.  So these are my choices:

*Fit my bust (and have ample cleavage coverage).  The problem with this is that I then have a ton of extra fabric floating around my waist, making me look boxy.  I like to be able to show off the smallness of my waist in relation to the size of the rest of me, so I like wearing clothes that fit near to my body (not skin-tight, just form-fitting).  So if my top fits my bust, I end up just looking frumpy.  I don't want to show the world my boobs, but I also don't want to give the impression that I am ""hiding"" my body.
*Fit my waist.  With this, the top usually pulls so much across my boobs, it looks like I am trying to squeeze into a shirt that is too small for me (which is kind of true).  Also, the cleavage is just out of control...way too much.  My figure looks nice, but I prefer to be a bit more conservative and not give off the vibe that I am trying to ""show off"".

Also, it is so hard to not be able to wear normal shirts because you have big boobs!  There are so many styles that look great on smaller-breasted women, but when I wear them, it looks like I am trying to be provocative.  Really, I'm not trying to use them to get attention...

Oh and let's not even talk about button-downs.

Has anyone found a way to deal with this problem?  Has anyone found any fabrics/styles/cuts that make it easier?

Found out today, after trying on a recent order of bras, that I have gone up a cup size and am in fact a 32F and not a 32E. Not a problem, just need to exchange some bras, happy to have found out what will fit me and support me.


Then I come on to reddit and start browsing the front page, I see a post about busty girl comics has made it pretty high up in /r/funny. I think, great! I love those comics, great to see that they are popular!

Then I make the mistake of going on the comments. 

Do people really think that F cup, or even bigger than D cup = fat? Is that the general opinion? Not that it should actually matter to be honest, but I feel alienated enough by clothes companies who think that chesty = fat, without the general population agreeing with them. 

You can be any size and be chesty :(


I was also fairly upset by a lot of sarcastic comments that ridiculed the idea that having big boobs could come with problems. Yes I love my girls, but I am painfully aware of some of the issues they come with, do people really think it is all perfect?

Probably not the sort of comments I should be reading after going up a cup size, but it has made me feel even more alienated, does any one else feel this way right now?

I can see people turning around and talking about me, I even noticed a couple with wide eyes start whispering.

I have been wanting a reduction for a long time. I have severe back pain, but I'm not going to lie. I want one just so I can feel NORMAL. It seems as if everyone is against me getting surgery. ""Why would you do that? Bigger is better. Girls would kill for what you have!"" or even better from my grandmother, ""God blessed you with a beautiful body, its a slap in his face to defame it."" 

No one is me. No one is carrying 20 lb weights of uselessness around on their chests. No one deals with the fear of some man attacking me because of them. I can't fit in shit and I'm just so damn frustrated right now. Sometimes I think about getting a machete and chopping them off. 

I'm so tired of these monsters. I can't wait to get rid of them. They have caused me so much pain inside and out.

Edit: Yes I have been diagnosed by my doctor. I've begun physical therapy and I'm exhausting my options before going through something invasive. I have cervical straightening of the spine, or a straight neck that doesn't curve, due to the weights on my chest."	t5_2ubfr	True

Long story short I have found a pretty dress that is backless and supports bigger boobs. http://www.asos.com/au/Oh-My-Love/Oh-My-Love-Sweetheart-Neckline-Skater-Dress/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=2751572&amp;SearchQuery=Sweetheart%20neckline&amp;sh=0&amp;pge=0&amp;pgesize=20&amp;sort=-1&amp;clr=Coral
I love backless dresses but find it so hard to support my boobs (or atleast stop them from looking saggy) in so many designs that bras are impossible for. I recently went on a giant ASOS spree and this dress was delivered. As soon as I put it on I loved it and I couldn't get over how great my boobs looked in it. It is a little funny with the straps; they are circles that slip around your shoulder but they are very comfortable.

1360096784.0	17ybsa	"Big Boob ""Hacks"""	lessentiel	28	5	41	"This post is inspired by a friend who recently had to go into a hospital for wound care - wound being the direct result of, well, her big boobs. She's a very close friend, and we've commiserated on boob issues many times, so I regret not having shared those tips with her before. Hopefully, this will help someone. 

The problem I'm referring to has to do with skin irritation and chafing UNDERNEATH and BETWEEN the breasts. Oh, the indignities of being a large-chested girl! Hot weather, sweating, wearing an ill-fitting bra, poky underwire can all aggravate the problem, and irritations, sometimes severe, may result, which is what happened to my friend. There are some obvious solutions, such as showering in the evening, instead of morning, avoiding irritating soaps and scrubs, wearing better-fitting bras, etc., so I won't dwell on those.

Instead, I'll tell you 2 additional ""methods"" that I've developed a few years ago that I find exceptionally effective.

1. Witch hazel solution. Typically used for all kinds of irritations and inflammations, it also has purported anti-bacterial properties (it does contain various amounts of alcohol as well, depending on the solution), and if used regularly, it's incredibly effective at PREVENTING any potential irritations.  Once or twice a day (preferably after a shower) saturate a cotton ball with it and wipe under and between the breasts. 

2. [Body Glide](http://www.rei.com/product/745878/bodyglide-anti-chafe-formula-045-oz,-silver/gray?preferredSku=7458780017&amp;cm_mmc=cse_froogle-_-pla-_-product-_-7458780017&amp;mr:referralID=14e97f13-6fd3-11e2-8751-001b2166c2c0) for all other times when you just have to wear that irritating bra or swimsuit.

I'll be happy to elaborate further, if anyone has questions. Or hear your ""methods""!"	t5_2ubfr	True
1360073578.0	17xkxl	"Dealing with bad service at the one place that carries ""Real"" sizes. "		32	8	8	"Right before Thanksgiving, I was in desperate need of a new bra so I found the one shop in town that has bands under 32"" and cups over DD. My fitting went fine, and I was sent some in a 34GG. I had gained some weight since my last fitting where I was at a 32F, so I felt like my sizing went right. 

Well, upon having the bra for a month, the straps were slipping (they don't adjust all the way. Why make bras like this??) and the band was way too loose. I wear it on the tightest hook and I can still pull it far away from my body. Luckily, the cups fit well so I don't have quad boob, which was why I needed a new bra. 

While I was there in the first place, I special ordered the bra I bought in black. They said it was no big deal if I decided against buying it when it came in. When they called to tell me it was available, I told them the issues I was having with my current bra and that I'd come back in for a fitting. 

So, I come back in for a fitting and they put me at 34GG again. Sure, it feels great while I'm standing there, but my job involves a lot of movement and lifting things over my head and I can't really test the bras without actually field testing it! I tried on probably 10 bras on my first trip, and 10 more on this next one, only to find one that fit alright. 

I asked if I could try a 32H and they straight up told me no. That I'd stretch it out. Whaaat? I can easily put a 34 band on the last hook with no discomfort. This, to me, is a sign that I need a smaller band. My mind was absolutely blown. 

Needless to say, I left empty handed. They tried to sell me on their alterations (which makes your bra non-returnable!) all while saying they didn't think I needed it and that they sized me right. 

Is my only option to just order 15 bras off the internet and have my own fitting? Ugh. This sucks. "	t5_2ubfr	True

1376154787.0	1k3hu9	UPDATE: Want to go bra free, looking for a buddy	mockturtlestory	33	9	29	"Well, it's been four months now of not wearing a single bra, and I said I would give regular updates, so here it is. First of all, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigboobproblems/comments/1c59ee/want_to_go_bra_free_looking_for_a_buddy/) is the link to the original post.

So far, my experience has been extremely positive. Only one person made a comment about it, and it was a female family member who was, by the way, wearing a bra that didn't fit her (it was even obvious through her clothing). In the original post I spent the first day wearing a spaghetti strap tank top with a supportive layer underneath. Then I ditched that, and started wearing tight tank tops underneath my t-shirts. Now I wear nothing at all underneath my t-shirts most of the time. I usually wear a light scarf around my neck, which provides some coverage for my nipples. Some t-shirts look a lot better than others, namely the ones that are made of loose, soft fabric and with a low v-neck or u-neck. Of course going bra free requires me to re-learn how to dress to some extent, and there are a few clothes that no longer look good, but I'm completely ok with that. Fashion for women with big boobs is difficult with or without bras.

My boobs do not hurt, although they used to hurt when I was wearing tight bras. At the time, simply taking them off at night would hurt like hell! Although that problem went away when I started wearing better fitting bras, the pain and discomfort never completely disappeared, and I could never find a bra that fit me according to the guidelines from /r/abrathatfits. Now I no longer feel pain in my boobs. It's as if they were no longer even an issue. They get in the way much less now that I no longer wear a bra, and I barely notice them; they are like any other part of my body.

The other day, and went for my first run without a bra on, and no support at all. I also run barefoot, so the whole thing felt quite natural. Will you believe me if I tell you I was also on my period? Well I was, and I felt *no pain in my boobs*. It was not even uncomfortable, and they didn't bounce all that much. Probably the fact that I was running barefoot helped with that, since it's a lot smoother and doesn't send shock waves through the body like heel striking with bulky shoes does. In fact I barely noticed my boobs, and instead I was able to focus on the new and interesting experience of barefoot running. 

I don't think people are put off by my bralessness, and as far as I can tell most don't notice it. The women I have told about this responded very positively and sometimes with admiration. Some of them said they hated wearing bras. 

Now, I understand that there is a big difference between a bra that fits and a bra that doesn't. However, like I said in my original post, I had been on a quest to find a bra that fits for many years, spending hundreds of dollars along the way on bras that would become either stretched and useless a few months later, or too small because my boobs would have outgrown them. I feel liberated now that I have abandoned this quest, and I think my boobs are ever-grateful. I have come to appreciate them much more now, and I accept that they do not look like big melons right below my chin (I just noticed that's exactly what the logo for this subreddit looks like). Rather, they ""sag"", because they're big, but that's fine. Gravity happens, and I don't think there are a lot of women with breasts my size whose boobs naturally defy gravity. 

If you have questions, I'll be happy to answer them!

1366436526.0	1cq76k	So how's my current fit look? Could I REALLY be a 28K/H (US/UK)?	moguishenti	26	6	16	"A friend of mine recently told me (upon hearing me complain about how hard it is for me to find 32DD bras and especially swimsuits) that I am probably wearing the wrong size bra. She told me of this sub-forum, explained about too large band sizes and too small cups, told me her size was actually 30G ""and you're obviously bigger than me"". She showed me a couple of her new, correctly fitting and well made bras and I was immensely impressed and wanted my own. I had no idea that bras in band sizes below 30 *existed*, much less in anything other than an AA cup. 

I followed the instructions and measured myself. According to the instructions, I should be a 28 band size, which makes perfect sense. Measuring my bust according to the instructions, though, I got 37"" translating to a cup size of K/H (US/UK, respectively)! 

I don't doubt that 32DD is not my correct size, and I know my band is too big and cup too small, but 4 inches off the band size and up 6 cup sizes? A G or F I would readily believe, but K seems a bit extreme. The bras I have now may not be that good, but they aren't THAT bad. The band doesn't ride up my back, shoulder straps don't dig in, and I don't spill or fall out of the cups all the time. I'm more jiggly than I should be, and the support isn't great, but it's not terrible. I don't have any pain unless I run or quickly go down stairs.

Here's pictures of the fit in one of my current bras. it is about 1 year old, and is a VS dream angels demi. I own 3 bras, and the other two are exactly the same size and style, just different colors. They get worn approximately the same amount.
http://imgur.com/a/Jczee 

Thing is, There's nowhere in my area I can even try on anything near my size without buying it online first. I'm a college student at the moment. My budget is modest at best. Whether or not I've measured my correct cup size, just about anything in my band size that fits will be $60 a pop, and I don't have a lot of money. If my fit is close enough in a 32DD, as much as I want a nice collection of Freya and Empirente lingerie in my size, it simply just may not be worth it right now.

I am aware that cub volume decreases with band size, but I just want to check your opinion of my fit, and check to see what you think.

What do you guys think? Is it really that uncommon for young girls to have pendulous breasts? Are there any exercises or anything I could do to help? Feels bad man :("	t5_2ubfr	True

1360514666.0	1892lk	I'm terrified of being professionally fitted	Laychips	28	6	11	"I know that's an odd sentiment, but I swear I have a reason.

So I've been steadily increasing in cup size through the past couple of years, finally going in and making the jump from 36D to 36DD last time I went bra shopping. It was not a pleasant experience. I told the saleswoman that I was very uncomfortable in my current bra, and she gave me a few to try on, and helped me figure out if they fit. *Her* solution for quad-boob was to just ""Make sure you shove the whole boob back in,"" though, and I guess that's where this fear comes from? She made me feel really pressured to just buy the bra right then, even though it was still kinda uncomfortable, but they didn't have any larger cups in my band size so I just went with it.

And, of course, there's the fact that I just measured *myself*, and I'm pretty sure I've passed the sizes that I can reliably find in the stores around me. Heck, most people I know have never even *heard* of H cups, let alone seen them in stores -- and I've been doing a lot of bra-browsing lately. Somas, Victoria's Secret... The woman I do most of my bra-shopping with isn't likely to be supportive (""But you fit into a 36DD the last time we went shopping!"") so I feel like I really need a bit of help here. Does anyone have any encouraging words/tips for not getting suckered into buying a bra right then by the sales attendant? "	t5_2ubfr	True
1357150562.0	15u4ah	Comfy Bras?		27	5	16	"Hello all, I have been perusing the webs for a while now looking for a comfy quasi-bra to wear around the house.

Even after being fitted at Nordstroms, I do get pain sometimes from the underwire on my regular bras irritating my skin. It will dig in, etc., especially when I am lounging around on the couch and whatnot (not sitting up straight). 

I have a ""genie bra"", and it is not bad. I'm looking for something like that but maybe a tad more support.

A must is some sort of mechanism to prevent my boobs from migrating towards each other. I sometimes wear this really basic sports bra around the house, and I get this massively uncomfortable uniboob where I must adjust every 5 minutes to send each boob back to it's own side of the bra. 

Has anybody had any success with a particular comfy bra? U.S. sources would be dandy, just in case I need to make returns. 

Thanks!

1354335236.0	1437ut	Not liking what he saw after my bra came off...Do you ever feel like an impostor/liar for wearing a bra that changes your shape?	mybigstupidboobs	29	7	34	"Is throwaway cause people mentioned are redditors. So I had an experience recently that I'm still trying to process and move on from. This guy I was seeing and I finally got to the clothes-off stage. We did webcam sex and it was really awkward and terrible and I noticed that he wasn't really looking at me.

Anyway, when I finally ask him about everything he confessed to me that he didn't find me attractive ""below the neck."" This is in direct confrontation with things he had said before, so I was surprised/hurt/whatever. I'm glad he was (eventually) honest with me, I certainly don't hold it against him for not finding my body attractive, and we've gone back to being just friends. Meanwhile, I'm trying to pick my body image up off the floor.

It got me thinking, though. It's not like this guy had never seen me before (we were friends IRL also). It's not like my body shape changed between when we last saw each other and I am obviously a thinish (38""b 29""w 40""h), curvy lady.

...Except then there's my bra. I have pendulous breasts (and have always had such) so when I put on a good bra, naturally, they're lifted up and made to look more ""perky"" than they actually are. This makes me feel great when I am dressed and have a good bra on, but it I feel really nervous about meeting potential sex partners and that moment when they realize that my breasts aren't ""as advertised."" I fear that look of confusion or disappointment. 

I dunno. This situation has really thrown me into a loop and aggravated my insecurities (obviously), but more than that I just wanted to see if anyone else had faced this ""issue"" and found a way to resolve it.

1354319756.0	142u5o	My whole life is a BBP. @_@ Who else has similar puberty horror stories?	Gnomii	31	7	14	"I'm still not completely positive where my boobs came from. My mom has rather small breasts (she currently wears a 34B but I'm not sure how true to size it is. She's that or a 32C, I reckon. Her bras don't seem to hassle her) Either way, she's not exactly busty. She's Indonesian so the rest of the family on her side lives literally on the other side of the world, but I have pictures and her sisters are the same way. My father is of mixed descent (very obviously Native, along with some German and his father was a second generation Lithuanian immigrant), and I can't go off of my Grandma or sister's sizes (my grandma isn't too large, and she's pendulous) and my sister's mother is both heavy and large breasted. It could possibly be my father's father's side of the family then, but I have no way to know!

When I hit puberty when I was 12, I left for Malaysia with my father for the summer. That was when my breasts appeared out of seemingly nowhere. Until then I was wearing 32 or 34B bras. My grandmother told me that one day, I might even go to a C cup. Woooah. Most of that summer, I went braless. When I got back, my mom's immediate reaction was *Where the hell did those things come from* along with just shock. I was about 100lbs when I left, and 130 coming back. My mother took me bra shopping, when we determined that I was a 34C. We ordered Barely Breezies and bought various bras along with 2 sports bras. I ended up having to wear both my strapless molded bra **and** a one of the sports bras, just to feel somewhat secure. Until we bought these about mid-way through seventh grade, **I was still wearing 34B bras**. That includes during gym. I remember one of the girls commenting on my ""poor boobies"" because they were popping out all over the place. I felt terrible in anything I wore. My one girl friend said to me once, ""Where you're at is good now. Any bigger and they'd be too big. 34C is good. What I really love is 32Cs, like how do they even have ribcages that tiny!""

Eventually I convinced my mom to let me go to Victoria's Secret. No one helped me and I determined that I was now, to my horror, at least a 34D. I didn't want them to be bigger. So I bought a few bras. I'm only 4' 11"" so the t-shirt bra I bought I hated, because the straps weren't fully adjustable.  I got 2 push up bras, the only kind I found that could even sustain the weight of my breasts! I hated my bras. I had to make the straps super short to try to make up for the lack of support in the band, the band was constantly riding up on the 3rd hook, and my breasts would literally fall out of the cups. I had to constantly put them back in. I learned to just deal with it for a while. I only had 2 bras really in that size so they got used quite a bit. And for a while, I really really coveted VS. I was so excited to have these pretty bras that actually ""fit"" me!

Then one day, out of curiosity, I went in and said I'd never been fitted. As soon as the girl said, ""You're a 34 *almost* C"" my respect immediately flew out the window. She gave me some 34Cs to try on and she asked how they fit. I showed her, and she went, ""Oh. I guess you're a 34D then. Hmm.""
I continued buying bras from them because I didn't think I had options.

Then about a year ago, after years of back pain, and shoulder straps digging in, and double bras, and my newly pierced nipples getting caught on the edge of my cups, I'd had enough. I started looking into how to determine your cup size, and was shocked. Looking back I still am. Even if I'd done the +4 method I'd still have been a 34E.

About 2 weeks ago I finally, finally *finally* got some Freya Decos that I'd ordered off of eBay for $21 and $25. One in 30G, whose gore I narrowed to better fit my close-set girls and shorten the band, and a 28G. I think my best fit will be 28GG if I can ever get a hold of it. I've spent a lot of time educating women I know about their sizes and debunking a lot of misconceptions about breasts and bra sizes, so much to the point of starting my own blog. But really, just in the week or some of switching over I'm NEVER going back. The difference is amazing. I have less back pain, my straps no longer painfully dig in, I feel supported, and my boobs actually look bigger in a bra with no padding. Every once in a while I would realize how large they are and ask my boyfriend if they were really that big, and he'd laugh and say yes, they are. I'm so use to them being squished and pushed out and all over the place. I look and feel a million times better, and it only took me 7 years. Now I just hope it doesn't take a year to migrate all my tissue back to the mound :c"	t5_2ubfr	True

How long, REALLY, was your recovery time? This surgery is scheduled for four days before my 21st birthday, and while I don't expect to be partying it up, were you in an okay state at that time? How soon did you drive? Did you take any painkillers?

Lastly... did people say anything to you after you had the surgery? Obviously people seem to feel it's within their rights to comment on my large breasts, but did you get any comments afterwards regarding the change? This will take place during my winter break from college, and the surgeon said he'll take me down to a D... I want to know if people commented on it to you, and how you responded.

DottyCherries11	26	3	14	"Hey everyone, after getting re-sized and slowly moving towards better fitting bras I've realised that I really want to open a shop. I've been finding it so hard to find good bras my size, and shopping online is okay but I much prefer trying them on in store.

My nearest Bravissimio is two hours away by train and there are no lingerie shops in my area or surrounding counties to cater for bigger busted ladies. I figure that there's a gap in the market that I could fill. I'm going to starting up seminars over this week and have looked at the government guides to starting up a business.

I think what I'm looking for is some emotional support! I'm nervous and though I've done quite a bit of research I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. What would you ladies be looking for in a bra shop? I'd probably be looking to cater for something like 28D to 40J/L but I'm not sure how probable that is! I'm feeling a little lost and scared as I've never thought about anything like this before.

What I do know is that I'm getting a bit tired of ordering bras online, only to send them back almost immediately. Also, the superstore own brand are just not good enough and don't cater for enough shapes and sizes, I want everyone to have a well fitting bra and not feel bad about what size they are after an ill-informed fitting. Our breasts are a big part of our lives and we spend a lot of money on them. I want people to be able to walk about of a fitting room feeling happy and normal, and to walk out of a shop with at least one well-fitting and pretty bra. I want to make people feel confident in their bodies and confident in bras that fit.
