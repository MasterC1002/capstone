1343738834.0	xg2q7	I gave Thom Yorke the wrong words to his own song at a concert, and he sang them.	oldmanwicker	521	71	70	"Thom played ""Airbag"" during a show in Oakland on his solo tour for the Eraser in 2010. It was beautiful until he got to the second verse and [completely forgot the words](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTXJdWHH6jU#t=01m42s). He looked around quizzically and saw/heard me screaming the words at the top of my lungs from the second row. He stepped over his amp, took out his earpiece, and leaned over the row of people in front of me so I could shout ""NEON SIGN!"" into his ear. Thom jumped back up to the mike, said ""I've gotta stop smoking that shit,"" and resumed playing.

I had already decided this was the best moment of my life, until I listened to Airbag a few days later and realized that ""Neon sign"" wasn't even the right line; it was part of the first verse. ""In a deep deep sleep"" were the correct words, but he went ahead and sang ""Neon sign"" anyway.

****

For the first time ever, Radiohead picked up another member - at least for touring purposes. Clive Deamer (of Portishead, Get the Blessing) performed with Radiohead for every show on this tour, bringing an entire second drum set into the fray. This allowed for Radiohead to experiment with their sound a lot, both with improvisation, as well as bringing back older material that previously seemed impossible to play live. 

****

**Noteworthy Live Debuts/Performances:**

**New Life**

* Identikit

A brand new song which gives us insight into the possible direction Radiohead might take next. This is one of their favorite songs to perform (from stage banter and interviews). It was performed quite frequently during the tour. 


* Skirting on the Surface 

A full band reinvention of a song previously performed by Thom during solo performances while touring for The Eraser and other small shows. This song wasn't performed as frequently as Identikit, and never became a regular appearance in setlists.

* Cut A Hole

Another new song which features a Portishead-esque vibe...perhaps this speaks to the level of influence Clive had on the band, or maybe it's just a coincidence. After its initial performance (in Miami, the first show of the tour) it disappeared after just two performances.

* Ful Stop

The final new song Radiohead unveiled on this tour is perhaps one of their best - ever. Throughout the tour, this song has evolved quite a bit, and every time it seems to improve (which is surprising considering how amazing that debut was in Chicago). It's jazzy, it's complex, and it sounds like the future... This song was the second most popular new song they debuted on this tour, but it still didn't get a whole lotta love. 


**Rare Episodes**


* Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box, I Might Be Wrong, Planet Telex, Exit Music, Got To Sleep, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Like Spinning Plates, These Are My Twisted Words, Climbing Up the Walls, Talk Show Host, A Wolf at the Door

Unlike previous tours, this tour featured an interesting set of oldies which didn't include many of the ""classic"" usuals: Fake Plastic Trees, Just, No Surprises, My Iron Lung, 2+2=5, etc. were nowhere to be found; even songs which many (myself included) predicted because they fit stylistically, including Sit Down Stand Up, Where I End and You Begin, and Dollars and Cents, were not performed.  Although many of these songs aren't exactly rare (AWatD, Planet Telex, TSH, etc. did appear in the IR tour in 2008/9), songs like Packt and SHA returned triumphantly after years of absence. Packt was performed once on this tour for the first time since 2001, in Glendale, AZ. Subterranean Homesick Alien was performed once as well, in Cincinnati this year, as well as twice last year (both Roseland Ballroom gigs) after an 8 year gap from 2003. 

**Old Songs, New Tricks** 

* Amazing Sounds of Orgy, Meeting in the Aisle, Myxomatosis, Kid A, There There, Airbag, Treefingers

With the addition of Clive, Radiohead was able to return to some of their older work and either bring it to the live stage for the firs time, or elevate a song that has been on the stage before to an even higher plateau. Amazing Sounds of Orgy ""disappeared like a wet fart in the wind"" all those years ago, as a b-side from Amnesiac, but 11 years later it returns as a dark and groovy jazz paradise, quite faithful to the studio version. Another b-side, Meeting in the Aisle, returned from an even older era - OK Computer, and flourished in a new setting. Oddly enough, MitA is one of the few instrumental songs Radiohead has ever performed, and coincidentally, Treefingers gave it company on this tour as another instrumental song.  Finally, Clive filled in some of the missing pieces on live staples: Myxomatosis finally had all of its rhythmically-syncopated madness filled in; Kid A had both drum parts at the same time, There There had *four* drummers at once (Phil, Jonny, Ed, and Clive); Airbag had those sleigh bells! I'm sure there are others but you can only get so much of the nuances from reports and camera footage - feel free to mention anything in the comments and I'll add it! 

****

**Oddities and Curiosities**

* Dollars and Cents and Morning Bell *were* rehearsed/soundchecked at venues prior to their respective shows but ultimately never made it into the sets. 

* In an interview that took place towards the beginning of this tour, Ed mentioned that they had rehearsed 55 songs for this tour; by the end of it, by my estimates, we were *just* below that number with 53 (however I am human too and could have tallied it up incorrectly). 

* The show-opener was exclusively Bloom for the first few legs of the tour; once Radiohead went overseas, they began playing Lotus Flower to begin their shows. 

* The average set length for the North American tours was about 22 songs; the average set length for the rest of the world was about 24 songs. Furthermore, the encores shifted from two relatively even encores to a longer first encore and a shorter second encore, and even three encores by the end of the tour! 

* We saw many different intros for Everything in its Right Place, including After the Goldrush, Unravel, The One I Love, and True Love Waits (which was an extended intro by the end of the tour - two verses, two choruses)

****

Rest in everlasting peace, Scott Johnson.

This tour has been a blast. Not only was I finally able to see them in person, but I had a lot of fun with you guys updating the sets live, waiting for a good stream to start up again, and simply talking Radiohead. Special thanks to /u/jjysoserious and /u/daebat for picking up the slack on the days that I was unable to complete the sets, and another special thanks to those of you who helped me out with the sets on all the other days - you know who you are. P.S. If there's something wrong with some stats or something just let me know.

I'll add a few more tonight before I pass out, and will edit the rest in as they get uploaded. Idioteque and Airbag probably coming next.

EDIT: Adding a bunch of new ones. They'll go on top of the ones I've already posted.

EDIT II: That's it. Ok, apparently it was 15 videos and not 17. Battery died on the camera before I could catch Reckoner and Karma Police. Karma Police was pretty incredible with the whole crowd singing it long after the band left the stage!
  
EDIT III: For the record, I hate people viewing concerts through a shitty 3"" screen as much as the rest of you. Let alone standing behind people who have both hands as high as they can raise them to record on a shitty phone, blocking everyone's view of the stage. Luckily my friend and his girlfriend didn't have an obstructed view and were able to record almost all of these by holding the camera around eye level. We all still got to dance and enjoy the show, without blocking the people behind us. But really, all credit goes to them for recording 90% of the songs.  Hope you guys enjoy!!"	t5_2r3p6	True

I suddenly saw it clear as day once when OKC popped up on my iPod, but I have never found any mention of this ghostly hand imagery in any discussion or analysis of the album's cover art. Is it just too obvious to most people to be worth mentioning, or have we been missing the forest for the trees? (Or maybe I'm just a ^\*cough* [pareidoid android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia).)

**EDIT:** I got an overlay app for my phone and [snapped an IRL version of my crude drawing](http://i.imgur.com/pOiqWt6.jpg).

"	MorphineSmile	181	28	74	"For the last few months, ever since joining Reddit and finding this sub, I've been upvoting anything that references the final track on OK Computer, 'The Tourist'.  Recently, someone listed this as their least favorite track on OK Computer, and I had to post in support of this glorious track.

The very nature of someone ignoring such a gorgeous song is ironic; according to [Greenplastic.com](http://www.greenplastic.com/radiohead-lyrics/ok-computer/the-tourist/), the song itself is about slowing down to appreciate your surroundings:

&gt;“The Tourist” was written by Jonny, who, explains Thom, was “in a beautiful square in France on a sunny day, and watching all theses American tourists being wheeled around, frantically trying to see everything in 10 minutes.” Jonny was shocked at how these people could be in a place so beautiful and so special and not realize it because they weren’t taking the time to just stop and look around.

Musically, the song is a slow waltz with soaring, operatic choruses, and a towering bridge which features one of Johnny Greenwood's best guitar solos (in my opinion), as it is ""overcharged"" to quote a lyric from the song, and seems to equally cry as much as Thom's plea for the listener to slow down.  

And speaking of parts of Radiohead songs which give you the chills, I personally get them every time Thom comes back in around the 4:30 mark.

Where are all my Tourist fans?!  Let's take a moment to slow down, and appreciate this underappreciated track!

Song lyrics provided by [Greenplastic.com](http://www.greenplastic.com/radiohead-lyrics/ok-computer/the-tourist/):

It barks at no-one else but me,
like it’s seen a ghost.
I guess it’s seen the sparks a-flowin,
no-one else would know.

Hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down.

Sometimes I get overcharged,
that’s when you see sparks.
They ask me where the hell I’m going?
At a 1000 feet per second,

hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down.

Hey man, slow down, slow down,
idiot, slow down, slow down."	t5_2r3p6	True

1355176384.0	14mky4	[PSA] /r/Radiohead, Trolling, and You: A Comprehensive Guide 	ParanoidAndroids	172	25	41	"Hey guys.

We've been getting flooded with a lot of posts recently that have been referencing some ""IRC"" (""internet Radiohead community"" according to these users) and although multiple users are using this phrase, it is in fact just one person behind all of these accounts (similar conversations are playing out in multiple threads from the same batch of users; moreover, these user accounts have been created in batches around the same time periods, and self-contained conversations occur between these dupe accounts).

Why is this happening? No clue, probably just trolling.

Over the last few days I have banned ~~**fifteen**~~ ~~**sixteen**~~ **seventeen separate accounts** (yes, you read that correctly - the tally was 15 when I started typing this post, 16 when I finished typing this post, and 17 from the first comment made) which are propagating the same links (among them covers of songs from ""family members"" with various ""disabilities""), making solely bullshit stories (such as the ""secret gig"" - but your bullshit detectors should have gone off, right?), and comments that simply insult other users (especially those who call out said bullshit).  

Some of this behavior is quite interesting, actually. Entire conversations have occurred between this one guy and himself... actually maybe it's more disturbing than anything. For the amount of effort that went into this, he probably could have made himself a really nice pack of sandwiches. 

Figuring this whole scheme out would've been more challenging if each account didn't use this ""IRC"" tag in every freaking comment they made, but this person is still committed to injecting pure shit into this community, so, *what should you do*? 

Report a comment or post if it seems suspicious to you. If you see this ""IRC"" nonsense anywhere, report it as well. Message the moderators if you have to. 

Thanks for reading this. 

Oh, one more thing: we don't need an acronym for our community. We are /r/Radiohead.

1349806070.0	117gke	My Epic Story: 8/10/12.	FFUUUUU	151	18	46	"I'm 17, and this was my first Radiohead show. The show was fantastic, but that's not what my story is about. Although there were some classic Thom moments: [him laughing at the beginning of Daily Mail and being unable to continue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8vEvsF1zlLo#t=47s); ducking under one of the screens as it lowered on him, [almost falling on the piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo8D9r2jPTo) and so on.

After the gig, my friends and I regrouped at the arena entrance, discussing the gig in excitement. We all had post-Radiohead depressing knowing that it was finally over and we had to go home. But before we could leave the building, a bold man and his wife (around 40 years old) handed us 4 grey wristbands and a piece of paper. They said ""Oh, here's some tickets to the Radiohead AfterParty, we don't want them"", and they walked off. We were frozen for a second, we didn't understand why we were given these, why us? At first we thought it was a scam, just some fake wristbands and some fake instructions for god knows what reason. After a minute of confusion and discussion, we decided to walk to where it was (a room by G entrance). The only problem was that there were 5 of us, and only 4 tickets. 

We approached the entrance and realised that this in fact, was 100% genuine. I thought there was no chance the band were going to be there, knowing Radiohead's low-key and private nature, and thought it was probably just a room full of Radiohead fans drinking alcohol. We spoke to the man at the front and made up some story that we had lost a ticket, and were wondering if we could get in. So we walk in to the reception area and speak to a man about our tickets. He asks us questions such as ""How did you get your tickets"". We froze for a second, and my friend managed to make up some story about a fictional 'manager' (purposely vague) sending us some tickets, but that he wasn't here to confirm it. He asked: ""Who's your manager?"" to which my friend replied ""Guy Ritchie... I mean Guy Ritchards!"". It was awkward for a while, but we actually managed to wing it, we all got in, it was insane.

So we walk into to a smallish room which is lit with entirely green light. There is a bar and some pillars, a very typical looking chill-out bar. But then, standing about five metres in front of me chatting to some people is Philip Selway. My heart stopped for a second. Fuck! It's Phil bloody Selway! We were not expecting this. So we casually walk around to try and blend in, to be one metre away from Ed O'Brien. What the fuck!! He is so goddamn tall and sexy, fuck it's literally two real physical members of the Radioheads! We try to contain our excitement. They were both hugging and kissing what appeared to be close friends and parents/family. This is when we realise that everyone in the room got their tickets from connections of the band, being either a friend of a friend or a family member and the like. But we're just five 17/18 year olds trying to fit in and not jump with girl fandom excitement. 

We decide to get some beers and discuss what the hell we were going to in this party. So I go over to the bar, and there is a man with a black hoodie on in front of me. He turns around to looking around... and it's Aaron Paul... Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad... What the fuck is going on now!? This is too much! My jaw dropped and I just didn't know what to do. I creepily stalked him for about 60 seconds before tapping him on the shoulder and saying ""Excuse me, I just wanted to say you're the best actor on television next to Bryan Cranston."" He says ""Aww thanks man"" and we begin to have a comfortable and longish conversation about Breaking Bad. I won't go into full detail on that converation, I'll save that for [/r/breakingbad](/r/breakingbad), but he did explain to me why Season 5 was split into to two. He also told me that Season 5 Part 2 hasn't even been shot or written yet. Crazy stuff. He was a real cool guy, really loved talking to his fans and didn't mind chatting away (I think he was super drunk though, later I saw him grabbing other fans and quoting lines from Breaking Bad at them). 

So this was already a pretty surreal experience for me. But it gets better. Nigel Godrich and Jonny Greenwood enter the room. Oh fuck. What do I do? There's no chance I can talk to Jonny, it wouldn't work. I briefly contemplate talking to Nigel as no-one was crowding round him as he is not quite a celebrity akin to Radiohead. However, before I can even begin to go over there, Thom Yorke is three metres from the left of me. WHAAAAAT. THOM YORKE IN THE FLESH IS OVER THERE. WHAT. We didn't know what do here. This was the real deal. He was there, chatting to fans and it was so surreal. He seemed quite happy chatting away so I considered talking to him. It was around 11:45 at this point and we needed to get on the tube and then back to the train station and not miss the last train home. It made us all nervous, time was running out and we hadn't spoken to anyone from Radiohead yet. I saw Colin enter too, smiling and signing someone's TKOL poster. I thought fuck it, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, I'm going over. 

I walked over and stood about 1.5 metres away from him, with my back turned the other way. I stood looking like a weirdo for at least 10 minutes. He was talking to other fans, and then his girlfriend for a while, and then some more fans and then his girlfriend again. He didn't look that happy but he was alone for a second and I took my chances so I walked over. Adrenaline was monumental. It went as follows:

Me: Excuse me (pause)

*Thom blankly stares at me with his droopy eyelid*

*I freeze up, no words come out. It is awkward for about 5 seconds*

Me: (leaning in to him) I was wondering what track you recorded at Jack White's studio?

*Thom thinks for a second*

Me: Or am I not allowed to know?

Thom: Erm... yes 

*Thom starts to smile now and it's more comfortable*

Me: If I list some songs, can you give me some facial expressions as a hint?

Thom: Okay...

Me: Identikit

*Thom brightens up slightly*

Thom: Maybe...

Me: Oh wow, I hope it's that. There are so many bootlegs online it was great to finally hear it properly

*Thom sort of nods awkwardly*

Me: Err... Cut a Hole?

Thom: No.

At this point my friend, who I was not expecting, walks over and joins in the conversation.

Friend: I just wanted to say it was a perfect set

Thom: Nah, we got told off when we went back

Me: Why? By who?

*Thom either mumbles something or weirdly does face*

Friend: No Supercollider though

Thom: No, we've redone Supercollider, I don't like the version we did.

Me: Oh? Why not?

Thom: It's just a bit, flat, stale.

Me: Oh

Friend: I was in Bilbao, if you remember

Thom: Vaguely 

Friend: During Nude, it started raining

*Thom laughs, and I'm so grateful for my friend saving the conversation, he seemed more comfortable again*

There were a few more words shared that I cannot really remember but I think my freind tried cutting the conversation off because we knew he really didn't like talking to fans, so Thom moves his wine glass into his other hand and we both shake his hand. As he shakes mine I say: ""Sorry to bother you, I'm sure you get this all the time/I'm sure you'll be getting this all night"". We walk away.

We both die. That was the surrealist experience of our lives, and it didn't sink in yet. The magnitude of that event was incomprehensible. There are millions of Radiohead fans who will never get that opportunity, and we did, by pure luck and chance. 

Unfortunately, we had to leave to run to our train, but I wanted to talk to either Ed or Colin because they both seemed so lively and willing to chat. Talking to Thom was crazy, but quite upsetting as it was a difficult conversation to have and knowing he doesn't really want to do it is hard, especially if he is your idol. We run back to the train and get home at 3.am.

**TL;DR:** Somehow got into After-party, met Aaron Paul and Thom Yorke.

I checked later and I was right that it actually is the same tone. Sorry if this was completely irrelevant and uninteresting, just thought I'd share to distract myself before an all-nighter for my final tomorrow.

EDIT: Just had the coolest thought: What if that note played like usual and when the door opened all of Radiohead were all bunched up inside inside the elevator starting to actually play the song!! That would be so awesome! Sort of like Arcade Fire in this video &lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjxef8AfVQg&gt;

1355578286.0	14w6f8	Nigel Godrich done a talk at my university about his views on the music industry. Here's a summary:		116	8	24	"Some people asked me to summarise and tell you what was said and I promised I would deliver, apologies for the delay as I have been busy recently.

First off, he is incredibly humble and was flattered by the turn out. His views on the music industry are more solemn than revolutionary. He believes that this  current 'shift' allows the international stars the opportunity to do as they please i.e. the Radioheads. However, for artists with integrity (the ones who aren't 1D, Nicki Minaj etc.) it is near impossible to have any recognition or a platform to start off on. 

He said he mentioned artists such as these for the examples because 'artists' should only have to release and perform their music, not have to create perfumes, clothing lines and ""all that bullshit.""

He was asked in the future what he believes will happen, he replied with no idea. Although he believes that the music industry needs a movement as bold and influential as Punk for anything to make a lasting impact. One thing he did say was that the artists must now also become the producers, that it is pointless to be signed to a label in this world and the best way to sell your music is to put a minimum price on it as well as a 'pay more if you'd like' touch. Those who genuinely respect music will pay for it.

At the end I got the chance to ask him a couple questions (thank him for the music etc.), he said that Atoms for Peace will definitely tour, Kid A was his favourite album to ever work on because he got so much freedom. He can never listen to an album he has worked on after it's done because ""even Kid A could have been better in retrospect.""

That's about all I can remember at the moment, I hope this has been of some interest. Have a nice day."	t5_2r3p6	True

It has been twelve years since Kid A came out. The album that ""changed it all""...the album which took my opinion of Radiohead from a great band to the most revolutionary band of all time...to my favorite band ever. 

It broke the standard and the mold of what everyone expected (OK Computer 2) and essentially changed the game of music for both the artist and the listener. Pushing boundaries doesn't even begin to describe it... 

So give Kid A a listen today, whether it's on your phone while walking to class or at home on a record player with a glass of red wine, and lose yourself in the atmosphere.

But I distinctly remember the lukewarm reception TKOL got around the release. 

This album has basically been on the back burner for me since the release. Wasn't too impressed at first, but after these two years the more I listen to these songs the more they just blow my mind. Bloom is beautiful, Little by Little is just classic Radiohead, Feral is some amazing IDM, and Lotus Flower is an excellent exercise in rhythm and groove. And Separator...damn I could talk for hours about this, but this is a top 10 Radiohead song for me. A hypnotic groove and some absolutely gorgeous vocals from Thom. 

I just want to encourage the skeptics to go back and listen to this masterpiece without your previous judgements. This album has aged like fine wine, TKOL is hitting it's apex two years later for me and it should for you. "	t5_2r3p6	True

AtEaseWeb member and creator of www.citizeninsane.eu (the conclusive Radiohead info database site) proposed coming up with a trustworthy way of raising the ~$1,500 to win the auction in September (Kickstarter?). Seeing as /r/Radiohead has almost 18,000 users, even if a portion of those contribute and spread the word, we could probably win this thing for just a few dollars each, much less than the cost of a new album and in a way that feels like In Rainbow's ""pay what you want"" model. Whoever donates the most for the community effort would be able to keep the tape after it has been recorded by someone with a professional means of doing so. This is Radiohead's first ever tape together, lets guarantee that everyone gets a chance to hear it!

[Guv'nor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW-9TcDTKa8&amp;feature=youtu.be) (from JJ DOOM’s Key to the Kuffs) was my single of 2012. It’s genius, that tune.""

**Stream Info:**

Tonight we are in for a treat: Pro-shot Bonnaroo footage streamed live! 

[**Link 1**](http://www.youtube.com/bonnaroomusicfest?feature=inp-hs-music) (starts 11 pm EST) **!!! LIVE NOW !!!**

For people with VLC, apparently [**this link**](http://aegdmcoachella-f.akamaihd.net/bonnaroo_1_3500@10954?v=2.6.8&amp;fp=WIN%2011,2,202,228&amp;r=MBQOT&amp;g=USQJDCTKAYBQ) pasted into VLC's url tab (under Media, go to Streaming) gives a high quality stream. 

**[FIRST SET]**

* Bloom (I've noticed they play this much slower than before...feels more grandiose and epic)

* 15 Step (already, I feel that this audio and video quality kicks Coachella's ass) 

* Kid A (FINALLY we get some proshot Kid A action!)

* Weird Fishes/Arpeggi (Thom Quote: ""We gotta OWN IT, he said!"" [in response to a fan's outcry])

* Staircase 

* The Daily Mail (Thom Quote: ""This is my piano. Say hello, piano."") 

* I MIGHT BE WRONG (Proshot mo'fuckas) 

* The Gloaming

* Separator (this newer version has minor changes from the FTB session [semi-unnoticeable to most] which somehow make it better)  [Side note: the guy who screamed ""In Limbo"" in between songs is a hero]

* Nude (Thom Quote: ""Where are you all sleeping tonight? In the fields? Is that what you guys do here? Face down in the mud? That's a British tradition. Take acid, face down in the mud, ring your parents the following Wednesday."")

* Magpie (Thom Quote: [after Magpie] ""That one was/was called Magpie. Good Morning Mr. Magpie. You stole it all. You bastard."") [note: this one is more of a paraphrase until the end lol]

* Identikit [fantastic quality...sounds much fuller than previous versions] 

* Lotus Flower (Thom Quote: ""Help me out of this box."") [feedback maxed on delay pedal to test the setting for the vocal layering later on] 

* There There [four drummers in unison..mmmph] 

* Karma Police [they do the vocal swells at the end live now?] 

* Feral [someone's on the wrong chord (at the beginning, the problem is fixed)]

* Idioteque [~~fingers crossed for a smooth performance...I want to hear that outro goddammit!~~ WOOO! Almost fell apart there at the end but *DAMN* that was awesome.] 

**[END OF FIRST SET]**

**[ENCORE 1]** (it's possible there is only one encore because it's a festival)

* You and Whose Army? (Thom Quote: [High register] ""You want some more? Sheeeeit."" [Normal register] ""I'd like a note please, that's a good one."") [YESSSSSS] 

* House of Cards [that falsetto...yes please]

*  Supercollider **(Thom Quote: ""This one's for Jack White. We saw him yesterday, a big thank you to him. You don't know yet, but you'll find out why."") [...uh......]**

* Bodysnatchers 

* EIIRP+True Love Waits intro (Thom Quote: ""Jonny slashed up his hands. You don't need your hands for this one. Well you do, but you can put the guitar down."") '

**[END OF ENCORE 1]**

**[ENCORE 2]** These guys are in for a *TREAT*. 

* Give Up the Ghost

* Reckoner (Thom Quote: ""This is for the Chilli Peppers"") [Phew, that was a close one! Special thanks to those of you who helped me out when my internet went down!]

* Paranoid Android (Thom Quote: ""Boop boop."") 

**[END OF ENCORE 2]**

**[END OF SHOW]**

**FINAL EDIT:** Lots of fun tonight. Longest set of the tour so far, too! Thanks for the discussion, and a preemptive thank you to AustinBrock for capturing the event for all of us to enjoy later. Good night everyone. "	t5_2r3p6	True

1322611568.0	mu06k	What I Love About Radiohead, as a Teenager	RockinSocks4	78	8	43	"I never particularly liked music as a kid. I would listen to the radio, I would memorize all the songs (mainly due to radio station repetition), and I would sing along with the family. But I never really liked what I was hearing. If my parents or siblings weren't listening to the radio, there would be no music playing for me. 
Then, I started high school, and I began making new friends after growing apart from my childhood friends during the summer. My new group of friends were big fans of alternative rock, my best friends favorites being The Mars Volta and Muse. And so I started listening to their kind of music, and suddenly, I was in need of an iPod. Once I had started listening and memorizing those songs, I felt a craving for more music. I went online to find bands similar to those. I suddenly remembered a band mentioned in a review for Muse's album Showbiz: Radiohead. 

So, on a whim, I bought OK Computer(as a CD), after reading that it was their most critically acclaimed album. It arrived, and I began to listen to it. I didn't like what I was hearing. As Airbag began to play, I realized I was listening to something different. I wasn't entirely sure what it was, but I didn't mind. I liked it. Then, out of the blue, the next song comes on. Paranoid Android. I sat, confused, unsettled for 7 minutes. I thought the song was garbage. Weird garbage. I was still baffled as Subterranean Homesick Alien started playing and completely looked over it. Then Exit Music started playing, and I wrote it off as boring and slowly tuned it out in the first two minutes. 

Then Let Down started playing, catching my attention again. I liked the fact that it was more listener friendly than the previous ones, and I liked it as much as I liked Airbag. Karma Police started playing, and I liked the piano, but I didn't understand the humor of it at the time, and also wrote it off as weird. I sat puzzled through Fitter Happier, wondering why they would even put such a bizarre thing on an album. 

I thought Electioneering was kind of cheesy, really only hearing the cowbell part and thinking of SNL. I thought Climbing Up the Walls was creepy, but didn't think too much of it. I listened to the final three songs with apathy, bored and angered for wasting $10 on a crap album. I rolled my eyes at critically acclaimed and went back to listening to Origin of Symmetry. 

The album remained untouched for weeks afterwards, I barely even listened to Airbag or Let Down. But then, I got into a fight with my friend, and I couldn't listen to The Mars Volta or Muse without getting angry, so I looked for my other music. I saw OK Computer again and listened to it again. Airbag was the same for me, better than I had remembered. And then something strange happened as I listened to Paranoid Android. Something about it... made sense suddenly. What I had once thought was a failed, crazed attempt to redo Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was actually an interesting roller coaster of feelings, from something irked, but peaceful, to full on enraged and violent, that suddenly calmed itself before making one last explosion. I began to realize that this song made sense now, because this is how I felt. I was mad, I pretended not to be, but I was ready to end my friendship with him over a small quarrel. 

It was here I realized that the reason Radiohead seemed so alien to me was because their songs weren't just about simple, raw emotions, like sadness or anger. Their songs are as complex as real feelings are, and each song on the album reflected that. Airbag was about the rebirth, the optimism that comes after staring Death in the face. Paranoid Android was an example of silent apathy becoming full on hatred. S.H.A. was about alienation and loneliness. Exit Music was about the mix of sadness and anger felt after a break up or a falling out with someone you cared for. 

By the end of the week, I had my friend back, but also a love for OK Computer. By the end of the next month I had everything except for Pablo Honey and Amnesiac. And now, I have all their albums (except Pablo Honey- people told me not to get it. Not sure if I ever will), and an array of their b-sides. I've fallen head over heels for those useless rockers from England.

But still, my favorite part of Radiohead is the emotions they convey. Because of them, I have a song for almost every mood I'm in. If I'm sad, I'll listen to Motion Picture Soundtrack, Videotape, or Fake Plastic Trees. If I'm angry I'll listen to Paranoid Android, Myxomatosis, Bangers + Mash. Nostalgic? Fog or Codex. Apathetic? Exit Music or Sit Down, Stand Up. And if I need inspiration? A Wolf at the Door, The Tourist, Reckoner, Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi, or Last Flowers. Heart Broken or Lovesick? Nude, How I Made My Millions, No Surprises, or Let Down. And just for the sake of listening to music? Too many. (Although favorites include Lucky, There There, Like Spinning Plates, Jigsaw Falling Into Place, Cuttooth, Lotus Flower, and Idioteque).

And this ends my boring, overly sentimental speech about how I fell in love with my favorite band. Congratulations on making it this far! Here's a TL;DR for you!

TL;DR: I listened to Radiohead, hated them, then liked them because their songs can mirror real emotion perfectly."	t5_2r3p6	True

There's no central message to the playlist as a whole (if Radiohead really had planned it, there would be) and the reasoning behind it all is far too absurd. I know this has to have been brought up before, but this and the ""Secret 10,000 Days song"" thing really got to me in a bad way. Oh, and the lyrics in the ""Secret Kid A booklet"" that fortold songs from an album that wasn't released for another 3 years? They'd already been performing those songs for years. Just because it hadn't hit the mainstream audience doesn't mean people hadn't heard the songs before. It's this kind of nonsense that annoys me.

I had the great idea of listening to Radiohead. I borrowed my roommate's Audio-Technica headphones, and sat down, completely baked. I turned on In Rainbows, and was instantly absorbed. I was hearing completely new layers of sound. I could follow Colin's basslines flawlessly. It takes Jigsaw to a level higher than I ever thought before. 

I can hear the beautiful chords of the acoustic guitar in Faust Arp 

I can hear that there is a slight reverb of Thom's voice in House of Cards

 I can hear the intermeshing of the arpeggios in Weird Fishes. 

I hear Phil's snare-tapping fade out in Videotape

I can see Thom's voice.

Even though I sound like a lunatic, its incredible. Try it at least once in your life. The experience is sublime.

1351194561.0	122zm9	I feel like talking Hail to the Thief.	cruithear	75	10	68	"I think Hail to the Thief is rife with quality material. Where I End and You Begin is in my top three for all time, and songs like There There, Gloaming, Myxo, 2+2=5, and Wolf at the Door are really strong highlights of that era for the band.

But I think Hail to the Thief has its share of problems (and note that these are just my opinions, and not terribly original opinions at that) that caused the album to fall short of its potential.

* The album is overlong. At fourteen tracks, HTTT is the longest album the band has released to date. Over the years, I've found myself skipping past more and more material, particularly if I'm near my music player or in the car or whatever. Sail to the Moon. Backdrifts. We Suck Young Blood. I Will. Punchup. Despite liking all of these songs to some degree or another, I feel like any of them could have been b-side material. Somewhere after There There, I start to get... not bored, exactly, but maybe exhausted by the material. The album stops feeling cohesive, which brings me to my next point.

* The album is poorly ordered. An [alternate, fan-made playlist](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125222603AAIIVsL) (thanks MorphineSmile!) that even earned a ""hmm"" from Thom on DeadAirSpace opened HTTT with There There and its rumbling tribal drums. The alternate playlist also did away with several of the songs I mentioned in the first point, relegating them to b-sides. For me, the end result was a tighter album that didn't suffer from too many stops and starts like the original (the momentum built by the rustic indignation of GTS and thunderfuck space-rock of WIEAYB hits a brick wall at WSYB; the groove creeps back in with Gloaming, erupts into fireworks with There There, and then dies out again with the sluggishness of I Will). I totally appreciate the need for balance on an album, but the bipolar momentum of HTTT's tracklist wears me the fuck out before I even get to the back end of the album.

* The album was rushed. The band was at the end of its contractual obligations with EMI for their sixth record, and after the Kid/Amensiac period it's not hard to believe that they were just eager to get it done, get it out, and get on with things. I think this is particularly obvious with I Will (I strongly prefer the LA version released on Com Lag) and Scatterbrain (whose Com Lag iteration I prefer to ignore entirely [seriously, it sounds like Jonny is playing a whoopie cushion]). I definitely don't fault the band for hurrying their last EMI album, but it does leave a fan to wonder what could have been with some of the songs (though I guess that's what [subsequent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZMEnDxe3TU) [live](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7M8gxPtz78) [performances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEtr2xJ1pts) are for).

Anyway. The point of this post wasn't really to bitch about Hail to the Thief; it remains a great album and one I listen to quite often. Some of my very favorite songs came from the Hail to the Thief sessions, but the album as a whole, I think, fell short of its potential.

So, I'm curious, then. What do you all think?
