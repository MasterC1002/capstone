1375541537.0	1jmm6r	A Firefall lament.	BrainKatana	73	11	96	"I think this is necessary to write up because I've seen echoes of it from the newer open beta players both in-game and on this subreddit. I started this as a reply to another thread, but it got long and slightly off-topic.

The game as it was 8 months ago was, mechanically speaking, a much better game. This is not me being a ""bittervet,"" this is simply the truth. Here's why:

* Battleframe progression was a tech tree where you actually unlocked things like better weapon variants, abilities, jets, and servos. It added tangible feeling of progression, not to mention providing a wider variety of base stat allocations to choose from that affected the ""direction"" of the weapon wen you crafted an improved version. Want a rifle that is ""biased"" to increase its damage when you craft it? Unlock the Astrek version. Want a bigger clip size? Grab Omnidyne-M. Instead of being scrapped, this system could have been combined with the constraint system in a much more interesting way than the current ""unlock the colored box"" system that is on the frame progression screen.

* Even though there were fewer ARES mission types, they didn't spawn 800 bad guys when you showed up and after you grabbed the objective. There was fun mission content that could be reliably soloed instead of the ""does this mission actually NOT require a group?"" mini game that has been going on for the past couple of months. The typical reddit/forum/in-game answer to this is ""group up."" My answer to that is ""based on player play trends in multiplayer PvE games, a wide variety of content that can be soloed is very important.""

* Chosen attacks on towers and outposts happened more often. I saw in the patch notes that this was recently increased again, so maybe its better. Tower assaults and losses add much needed variety to what is (currently) a somewhat stale, static, and small game world.

* You could bring crafted gear and custom frame setups into PvP. They removed it in the name of ""balance,"" which was a huge mistake IMO. It neutered the meta, and now the PvP is pretty stale.

* All PvP gametypes are rehashed UT/Quake gametypes. Even Jetball is just Bombing Run. In a game where they have decent, skirmishy AI, a wide variety of roles between frames, **and** an infrastructure to support high-speed player/AI/player interaction, it's disappointing that they haven't created a more ambitious and unique PvP gametype.

* Permanent item loss is psychologically punishing. It makes every fun thing in the game slightly less so, and it makes dying very frustrating. Red5s ""official"" response on this feature to the up-in-arms side of the community was *literally* ""[in the end you have to eat your vegetables](http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/durability-%E2%80%93-we%E2%80%99re-doin%E2%80%99-it-live-wall-of-text-remix.669441/page-15#post-12730341),"" which is a terrible attitude for a developer to take... **especially** one with a fledgling F2P project that is surrounded by other, high quality competition, all of which have taken decent lateral development strides in the last 6 months. For the curious, those games are: Warframe, Blacklight Retribution, Wildstar (still in super CB), and Planetside 2, not to mention TF2 (the western powerhouse) and Crossfire (the eastern powerhouse). Players will simply go elsewhere for their F2P shooter/MMOShooter.

* There are other, better designs for an economy of sinks and faucets that don't involve permanent item loss. Red5 simply chose permanent item destruction/actual entropy because they did not want to explore other options and/or felt that a full economic rework was unwarranted at the current stage of development. The only other decently popular (current) game that I can think of with permanent item loss is EVE Online, and in 10 years they haven't surpassed 600k subscribers (all of whom are paying customers...). EVE is also a game where there is loads of other stuff to do; the variety of potential play options is comparatively huge, and the earning side of the economy isn't strangled by every player mining asteroids (resource gathering).

* UI modding is cool, but Red5 has practically shown a dependence on the mod community to make their UI even remotely up to modern standards. As an end-user, this is just awful. It means that you have to gather 3rd party programs and modifications from all over the internet to have even a passable experience with the game UI, potentially putting your computer at risk for malware, and (based on the sites I've seen used to distribute even the most-recommended mods) *definitely* at risk for adware and spyware.

* Finally, the parts of the community that inhabit both this subreddit and the official forums are, in general, extremely defensive about the game and treat anyone with any complaint very poorly instead of attempting to have a constructive discussion. The game population in my experience is, on a scale of WoW Barrens to your best friend, somewhere around a pack of rabid coyotes. It's practically impossible to get a straight answer or discussion from anyone, even if it's about a brand new feature that came in with the latest patch. IMO, if Red5 doesn't run the game into the ground with hardcore features and an overall lack of polish and content, a community of immovable, elitist assholes will run off any new players looking to learn the game, especially if those new players approach them in any state of frustration.

So, that's my lament. Take it as you will. I'm sure many of you will feel the need to defend the game, and please do so as constructively as possible. I posted this for 2 reasons: to get it out of my head, and to get it out there for others to see, so they know what they could be getting into if they choose to pick up one of the Open Beta Starter Packs. For the record, I've been playing the game for almost a year, and I purchased the $100 founders pack because I was convinced the game had upward momentum. Now, I'm not so sure."	t5_2s629	True

There is a very simple method I found while using the scan hammer:   
  
*  Scan and fly up, have a look at the lighter coloured lines and what direction they move in. [Example](http://i.imgur.com/an5nOm3.gif)

""Hey all,

As you may remember, in order to focus the team's time and energy on getting the next major milestone out, we have put a hold on the weekly beta patches. In place of those patches, I wanted to give you all an update on where we're at with the milestone and talk about some of the features that have been implemented so far. I will try to break out the update by major feature. As always, please remember that there are multiple teams working on multiple aspects of the game. No single feature set is getting the entire focus of the staff.

*Disclaimer: Any or all of this can change at any time. We iterate on designs a lot and I highly expect a lot of this to change as we play test and get feedback from the team.*

**New PvP TDM Map**

The team working on the new TDM map has gotten everything blocked out. We've had multiple internal playtests and the map is getting high ratings on the fun scale. At this point the team has moved on to changing the map from blocked out props to fully artified assets. This process will take a while as there are custom pieces that need to be modeled out, textured, and then placed in the map.

As a side note, a handful of people have been working weekends in order to create new gametypes that can be placed on multiple maps. While these most likely won't be implemented for this milestone, it is a huge step forward in getting more objective-based gameplay in PvP.

**Core Combat Team**

The Core Combat team has been busy prototyping all the features they want in the game. By the end of this week, that work should be all done and then we can spend time playtesting and tweaking the values. Some of the more extreme changes have come with trying to make the battleframes more skill-based. Here are some highlights...

-Animated hit boxes that match player shapes (arms, legs, torso, etc).

-Added new Assault primary weapon, the Fusion Cannon. Has almost no splash, faster projectile speed, direct hit bonuses.

-Engineer primary weapon is now a Tesla Rifle, grows in damage while you hold it on someone, rapidly loses damage buildup while missing. Damage buildup decay is slower if you stop firing and/or are missing.

-Engineer abilities are now more trap-based leading to smaller, shorter time-duration, quick-deploy items.

-The Medic heal gun has been removed for a projectile-based weapon that either heals friendlies or damages enemies. It also stacks a damage vulnerability debuff on the target. +10% damage taken per hit landed, up to 30% maximum. Lasts 5 seconds.

-The Dreadnaught HMG now has damage degradation past 20 meters, consistent accuracy (it’s consistently inaccurate), much faster rate of fire, reduced damage per round.

-The Recon sniper rifle has been changed to a charge-up sniper rifle. It charges while scoped and deals more damage based on charge percentage.

This is just a small sample of the changes. The vast majority of abilities have been changed, along with movement, jump jets, health values, etc.

**Crafting and Resource Team**

The crafting and resource team have finalized what resources will be available along with what each resource will do to equipment crafted with that item. This requires completely rebuilding the way we create equipment and has been a huge task for both the crafting team and the backend development team to make this system as dynamic as it needs to be. Now that this is finalized, we can start creating the new equipment so that it can be implemented in-game.

**Battleframe Tiers &amp; Constraints Team**

Players no longer level up as they gain experience. Experience is now stored on a per-battleframe basis and can then be spent to unlock technology. The constraints system has been finalized to use three constraints; weight, power, and CPU. Battleframes provide weight, but take CPU and power. Backpacks provide power, but take CPU and weight. Battleframe servos provide CPU, but take power and weight. Abilities and modules require a mixture of all constraints. This provides a fairly complex system with a lot of room for customization. You really have to consider each and every thing you put on your battleframe.

The certificate system that you'll spend XP on is being built out along with the battleframe garage where you'll modify all your equipment (this replaces the Loadout Modification Station and player inventory). For right now, we are focused on developing a single tier of equipment and making sure everything in that tier is fully fleshed out with all the equipment, modules, abilities, etc. that a player would want.

**eSports &amp; Matchmaking Team**

We've been able to implement open world duels in a one on one or squad on squad setup. We've also implemented the ability to challenge a full squad to a match on Sunken Harbor pitting team vs team in a private match. We've developed the ability to watch live and prerecorded PvP matches from inside the client. We've implemented the spectator mode and continue to improve the functionality for both casual observers as well as broadcasters that are looking for more advanced functionality. We have some cool stuff to show there, but want to save it for a bigger presentation.

We are working on matchmaking within a tier to use player-skill to determine matchups while also taking into consideration squads of all sizes. We have also implemented a deferred rewards system meaning that you only receive the XP and loot rewards at the end of a match, not during the match itself. This allows us to do things like XP bonuses for playing under played PvP maps or rewarding the best players on a team regardless of win or loss.

**Character Customization**

Lots of work is being done to open up our system to allow for more character customization like new hair styles, colors, etc. This is mostly backend work, but will get really exciting once we have the store front online.

**Open World Dynamic Missions**

We've rewritten the Chosen invasion code so that it works in the new system and allows for capture and recapture of cities. Work is now being done to make the entire war front more dynamic where you really have to pay attention to incursions and Chosen patrols in order to prevent these attacks. We've also done work on Thumper encounters to make them more dynamic and less predictable. In combination with the new resources you'll be hunting for, Thumpers should be a lot more enjoyable.

**Trans Hub**

Trans Hub is going through some revitalization and missions are being added around the area to tell more of the story. Still a lot of work to do here, but it's coming along quite well. The world builders have done even more to really spice up Trans Hub and make it feel more alive.

And much much more. There are multiple smaller teams that are working on stuff behind the scenes and even more work that is being done on off-hours from some really passionate people to make sure that we are making a kick-ass game. We still have a long ways to go and will probably be taking extra time to make sure to iterate on some of these designs before we get to the point where we're ready to release it.

As always, I have no specific dates for the release, but I will continue to keep you all updated as best as I can. Thanks for sticking around and helping us make this game."""	t5_2s629	True

1371071155.0	1g80ia	PSA: Thumping is about Aggro Control, not Killing Everything ASAP	TimmyToldYou	46	7	16	"This one shift in mindset will increase the thumper size you're able to solo, and make you far more useful to any thumping team you're on. I'm usually able to finish medium personals with about 50% integrity on most frames, and my bastion can solo heavies. Here's how:

Aggro. It is the basis of all thumping. In laymen's terms, targeting priority for mobs. Mobs when they spawn will aggro your thumper, and walk towards it to attack it.

However, dealing damage to them (a good amount of damage, a whiptail thresher, for example, usually takes two good grenade launcher shots) will make them switch aggro onto you.

""But Timmy"" some will ask, ""Why do I want them to attack ME? They'll kill me!""

Here's why getting all the aggro for yourself is a good thing: 

**You can move and sustain. You can jet into the air, sprint, use teleport shot, heal, etc.**

**Your thumper can do none of these things. It is completely at the mercy of any mob that gets close enough to hurt it, and healing is not an option.**

The trap I see many new players falling into is trying to apply as much dps as possible to the threatening enemies until they're dead. This is not the way to thump.

You must only apply as much dps as it takes to draw aggro onto yourself. One stock battleframe with no mobility abilities can indefinitely dodge 5 terrorclaws' attacks with decent skill, while it takes a ludicrously high amount of time to KILL 5 terrorclaws. Time the less threatening swarms have to deal damage to your thumper, and the explosive Aranhas have to close the gap.

The damage required to gain aggro is less than a 10th that is required to kill something, and it reduces the damage done to your thumper by the same amount as if you had killed the enemy. Just do enough AOE damage to gain aggro from whatever's attacking your thumper, then when the thumper is alone and happy, spam AOE on the horde chasing you.

Have fun!

1364006976.0	1au7xi	Want to swap your aftermarket Battleframe's Abilities/Specialties/Passives with Accord ones?  Here's How.	the_tip	35	1	13	"Hokay, so The first thing I noticed when logging in after the patch was that each of the Aftermarket battleframes comes with a specific loadout, some of which feature all-new abiltities.  Well, I for one was really missing poison trail (which no longer is available by default on the recluse)  and Crater (which is no longer available by default on the Firecat).

I found myself wishing that I could have the same ability combo as I had before the patch on my Recluse (Healing wave, Poison Trail, Creeping Death)  as well as my bio needler, and the lifedrain that comes along with it.  After some discussion, and some fiddling around I found the answer:

1. open your battleframe garage
2. select the Accord Branded Battleframe (formerly T1) of your choice.
3. click the chest area, choose Abilities 1-3 and for each of them select NONE.  effectively unequipping the stock accord frames.

**NOTE: for accord biotech, click Passive/Specialty (cant remember the name offhand)  and select NONE there too, effectively unequipping the siphoning plating.

4. select your aftermarket frame of the SAME CLASS  (biotech -&gt; recluse or dragonfly  etc etc)

5. click the chest, click ability 1,2 or 3.  You'll notice you now have ALL of the accord abilities available to equip!  (hooray!)

go nuts!  Also, you can now equip your recluse/dragonfly with the siphoning passive from the accod frame which will give you 4.25% hp back for all the damage you inflict with ANY WEAPON not just the bioneedler.


NOTE: if you dont see them after unequipping your T1 (accord) battleframes,  type /rui in chat and hit enter, this will reload your UI, if that doesnt work log out then back in.   

TL;DR - if you want to use the accord abilities on aftermarket frames, UNEQUIP the accord frames of the corresponding class to make them available to equip on your (formerly T2) battleframes.

EDIT: Apparently the T1 quartermaster in Copa is still selling all of the former T1 abilities, meaning you can purchase them for use on your aftermarket frames as well if you don't want to bother unequipping them from your stock accord frames."	t5_2s629	True
1362929026.0	1a0xqf	Upcoming Changes scheduled for 03/22	gadabyte	42	5	51	"For some reason, it took me quite a while to track down a list of the upcoming changes, so I figured I'd post them here in case there's anyone else who is new and doesn't know where to look, or just can't internet.

Info taken from the 03/09 [Firefall Live](http://www.firefallthegame.com/2013/03/09/3639/).  They're discussed in the video on that page, but here's the rundown for anyone (like me) that prefers text to video (text also available at the link, I just copied it over).

* Existing Crystite (pre-March 22nd) will be changed to Beta Crystite
* All resources (pre-March 22nd) can be refined into Beta Crystite
* We will have a vendor available for players to buy rewards with Beta Crystite
* All crafted gear will be wiped
* Crafted items such as ammo packs, Melding Anomaly Neutralizers, Thumpers, etc. will NOT be wiped
* Any battleframes you have unlocked will be available to you and all XP earned will be refunded to you
* Battleframes will retain the warpaint you last applied to the battleframe
* Also worth noting, with the new crafting system, INITIALLY, all crafting recipes will be available for everyone for testing.  This is not the end goal, it is temporary.  We will remove access to the recipes (not the items you had already built), and have a technology tree for players to progress through on the crafting end. If you guys have any questions, please let us know!

* **[edit, courtesy of bromega322 &amp; redtracer]** Each battleframe should feel more unique, and there will be new abilities that we have not yet seen.
* **[edit, courtesy of treezat]** The pvp/pve frame split is slated for 03/22 as well.

Here's what I take from the info:

* Unlocking as many frames as you can before 03/22 might be a good idea.
* XP may be more useful than resources from now until 03/22, depending on what exactly they decide to make purchasable with beta-crystite.
* Crafted gear is now less valuable than resources until 03/22, as gear will be wiped while resources will just be converted to beta-crystite.
* It'll be open season on crafting for a while after 03/22, since anything you craft won't get wiped when they wipe ""unearned"" recipes from accessibility.

If there's anything I've gotten wrong, or if anyone has any insight/plans for what they plan to do prior to 03/22 (or crafting-wise post 03/22), post here!"	t5_2s629	True

But all of them seem to be very very long. I thought I would put together a list of short tips that would help a new player, especially tips that are easy to miss, or not mentioned by the in-game help.

1. After you do the tutorial quest that shows you how to switch your frame, you can immediately switch back to the frame you picked in the first place.
2. The 'c' key brings up the drop-down menu, which you navigate with the mouse. Tons of useful stuff is in this menu, including the scan hammer and the thumpers. (I think the tutorial mentions this, but I missed it cause I was in combat).
3. Crystite is basically cash. It drops from everything and you use it to buy stuff (including T2 frames which are expensive).
4. The other minerals are used for crafting, but you don't need to pay much attention to that until you get your T2 frame.
5. Battleframe garages and stations are located at almost every base. Molecular printers (where you do crafting) are harder to find, they are only found at major bases.
6. You can look at the tech tree, and unlock abilities, at any time just by pressing the T key. You don't need to go to a garage. But you do need to go to a garage to actually start using the stuff you've unlocked.
7. To start using a different piece of equipment (like something unlocked via the tech tree), go to a battleframe garage and *click on your player model* to bring up the appropriate menu.
8. Before you go out into the world, grab a bunch of sonic detonators. You can craft these. (as per comments: don't buy them from the vendor)
9. The map can show elevation/mountains if you zoom in. Try to go around the mountains instead of over them. :)
10. Don't stand in a base's spawn point if the base is about to be captured. I learned that the hard way.

Any other short tips that you would want to tell your newbie selves?"	t5_2s629	True

My main issue with Firefall is it's slow learning curve. Everything you do in the game is fairly easy to do, once you learn how to, but too much of it requires asking in zone chat how to do it.

Examples of things they don't explain to you how to do:    
Add friends, join/create a group, craft X or Y (a lot easier in the new patch), how do I see at night (or turn on my flashlight), how do I equip X, I unlocked Tier 2 how do I equip it, do any of my abilities or exp move over when I unlock Tier 2, how do I call down a thumper, that you can/have to switch between options for the 4th ability (scanhammer/thumper/et al), how do I refine minerals, how do I scroll through the chat box to see older messages (still don't know how to do this)?

And these are just things off the top of my head. Even after the patch where they made these things easier to do, they still don't tell you how. There are too many basics things people are asking which should be taught to you early on in the game or once you get access to them.

Many of these things could easily be taught through quests or tutorials. The first time it gets dark if there was a tutorial box that popped up and said ""Hey it's dark you should try out your flash light by pressing X"" and didn't go away until you used your flashlight that'd be great! 

If people don't like these tutorial boxes popping up and cluttering their screen they could turn them off in the options. 

**TL;DR** Many things in the game aren't obvious how to do them, a training quest or tutorial to learn how to do them would be an easy solution to this.

**Edit:** [no-tec informed us](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/y4rth/does_firefall_need_more_tutorials/c5sh5xn) that they're very aware of this. From a Dev's perspective it's smart to do tutorials last, otherwise you're redoing them every update."	t5_2s629	True

I've been in the closed beta throughout, and hadn't played in a while untill the open beta launched. I was pretty excited to check out the game again, and I had good reason. It's a ton of fun, and the game as a whole is very addictive. There are downsides to the game being in beta naturally, thinks like SIN syncing rather slowly, glitches in the UI, marketplace not loading, things like that. But those are really expected I think. There are two things however that are really bothering me as a player right now, to the point that I can't find the motivation to continue playing. 

1. The fact that the gear i spend so much time and effort crafting, will eventually be permanantly destroyed when I run out of repair pool.  I don't think this is necessary at all, and because the game doesn't tell you things like this, its also something a lot of people don't know. Is there really a point to this? I mean, lets think about it this way. There are currently 15 battleframes. All of which require different gear and items and weapons etc. I very seriously doubt anyone will solely play nothing but one frame indefinably. People will be playing multiple different frames. However... due to the way repair pools decay ,  It would push me to sit on one frame and play it forever. I mean, you'll craft your item, just so you can use that item, to gather the mats you'll need to craft it again. It makes no sense to me, and is really turning me off of the game. 

2. The world seems dead to me. Let me explain what I mean. It's quiet. Too quiet. In every other mmo I have ever played, be it closed beta, open beta, or full release. Chat is very active. Now, I'm not saying its always positive, a lot of the time its negative and spammy. But the chat in firefall is dead. And it makes the world feel very empty to me, especially when I'm playing alone, running across the map and not seeing a single other player because there is no reason to be anywhere  where there isn't a event happening. If i pop in and none of my friends are on, I feel like im playing a single player game. No one chats at all unless its to ask a quick question about one of the many mechanics that the game fails to explain. I really don't understand why it is that way. What is keeping people from being social in this game? Especially considering how often you have to play with other players. I can't even find a squad most of the time because when I ask, no one answers or says a word. It baffles me, especially because of how nice of a community the game has.

Aside from those 2 things, I find the game to be very entertaining. I have a lot to learn still about going into Antarctica and the other realms and whatnot and I haven't gotten to see any of that yet. I love doing the missions and jumping from one event to the next. It's fun. But those 2 reasons I mentioned are enough to put me off from the game. "	t5_2s629	True

There are now **5 primary types of minerals** in Firefall. Every primary mineral has **3 subtypes**, each of which corresponds to one of the 3 primary attributes of every BattleFrame.  Each subtype has values for all 3 of the primary attributes, they just favor one in particular. These minerals are:

**Bio-Organic/Bioactive**

* Compounds (POW)
* Stintgel (MASS)
* Smartgel (CPU)

**Carbon**

* Energized (POW)
* Composites (MASS)
* Electroactive (CPU)

**Ceramic**

* Dialectrics (POW)
* Composites (MASS)
* Insulators (CPU)

**Metals**

* Conductive (POW)
* Hi-Tensile (MASS)
* Computational (CPU)

**Polymers**

* Conductive (POW)
* Hi-Strength (MASS)
* Electroactive (CPU)

So, when you are trying to craft a subcomponent, such as a ""Hybrid Fuel Source"" for some new jump jets, you'll get 2 main bits of info: 

1. What primary type of material you need (Ceramics)
2. What subtype will yield the best results, by way of its main attribute (Dialectrics)

Naturally, you could use some other type of Ceramic and craft something, but the results would be subpar. **Unless** you have another subtype that is of such a high quality that it outshines the ""preferred"" subtype.

**Quality Level**

Quality Level (QL, or Q^ ingame) is the basic measurement of how much of each of the 3 primary stats a given mineral subtype can have attributed to it.  For example, it is technically possible to have a ""power"" subtype (such as Ceramic Dialectrics) of such a high quality that its CPU stat is higher than the currently available ""primary"" CPU ceramics subtype (Insulators). In this case, assuming you can get enough, it's may be better to use the mineral with the higher stat value instead of the ""primary stat"" mineral, but you might run into higher constraints because of this. It's also worth noting that a given mineral's QL is always the value of its primary stat, with it's secondary and tertiary stats coming in a 66% and 33% of its QL, respectively.

**Purity and Refining**

Thumped minerals are ""raw"" and must be refined. Mineral purity is a 1000 point scale of the conversion ratio from ""Raw"" to ""Refined.""  At 0 Purity, you will successfully refine 50% of the resource. For example, if you have 100 Raw Ceramic Insulators, and their purity level is 500, when you refine them you will get 75 Ceramic Insulators.  The time-to-refine is dependent upon how much of the mineral you are refining, at 1 second per-resource (60 resources per-minute).

That's pretty much it. Happy Thumping!

*Disclaimer:* I can't guarantee how long this information will be correct or close to it. Also, I think the changes to the crafting system are a huge step in the wrong direction for this game because of the massive learning curve they create, totally inconsistent naming conventions for mineral types, and how much patience it requires to learn what everything in the new system is and how it relates to what you are unlocking on your BattleFrame.  This crafting system strikes a huge blow to any kind of successful player onboarding, which is incredibly important during the early stages of a F2P product's life.

TL;DR: If you don't know how to craft, this is a bunch of information to get you started.

I promised this kind soul him I would pay forward the gift someday. So here's my chance, I have two invites and they are both being given away here.

There is no contest other than promising to pay forward this gift to another Redditor patiently waiting as you and I both have. Tell me you will do that, and post your email. This is the best way I know how to help this subreddit and amazing game grow.

When I come back after work I will choose two I feel most deserve a key. Afterwards I will edit the thread to let you know they are gone.

Good luck to you all, and I'm sorry I don't have more to give. If you're not chosen this time don't worry, I will continue to give all of my invites from here on out to everyone who posts in this thread.

Also- if you're afraid to post your email here you're more than welcome to PM me, just make sure you let me know so I don't skip you for not knowing how to contact you.


Update- I actually have 4 to give away. But the first was just given out to the first poster Varis259, second to [Vehshya](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/r8yc0/more_beta_keys_coming/), third to Jarben427 and the last to Omnom25!

Don't get me wrong.  After hours of figuring it out, I think I ""get it"" but it's somehow worse than before.  It's just not intuitive at all.  What I would like to see, is an option to see stuff that I actually care about for the frame that I am currently using.  I also have no idea why there are components to make items.  It's just an extra mundane thing that adds nothing.  

I think that if you want to make an Assault cannon,  Click on that cannon, can give you like 2 or 3 boxes where you can put in whatever crafting stuff to make it, then, create it.  Having extra drop down options in crafting for chambers, and barrels or whatever is silly.

[Graphs for Questions 1 through 3](http://i.imgur.com/AAlUdEq.jpg)

First question is probably a no-brainer with reddit and gaming general distribution.  Only about 40% of our subscriber base have been playing the game longer than 6 months, most users are still new to the game.  **68%** of people have (or are likely) to put money into the game.  This is actually a surprising number to see considering the free to play model.  Seems R5 is doing something right in that regards.

[Questions 4 through 7](http://i.imgur.com/2Ha9CGn.jpg)

Most popular battleframe class is Assault and the least is Engineer.  You can see the further breakdown as Firecat is the most popular frame with Mammoth and Recluse following up behind.  While (outside the accord frames) Electron, Rhino and Nighthawk are the least popular frames.  Generally all the Frame Classes are in a close tie for what people want to come out next.  Accord Merit Points closely followed by Experience seem to be the primary limiters on progression at the moment, though the others arn't too far off either.

[Questions 8 through 10](http://i.imgur.com/XipyOQ4.jpg)

/r/firefall is sitting at a good place with a bunch of 4/5 ratings though I agree too that it always can be better.  Quality of R5's involvement here seems to be pretty solid with a bunch of rating 5s and 4s, keep it up guys!  As far as posting amount, seems ok but could always use a bit more attention here.

Our experience of Firefall was basically summed up by ""we can't find anything to do"". Like, at all.

We ran around for 2.5 hours, found a lot of people thumping (which got boring really quickly, standing next to a thing and one-shotting about 5-10 insects - does that get more interesting later and if so how?!).

Found a couple of missions. One to defend Sunken Harbor... shot a few enemies, then the city exploded and we were all dead. According to map chat it takes 3 hours before we can attempt to recapture it..?

Found another mission, which involved picking up a datapad then running with it back to a hand-in while being shot at. Took about 30 seconds in total then we were back to 'now what'.

The rest of the time me and my community were running around desperately trying to find ANYTHING to do. Mostly heading to purple/white icons on the map, failing to find a path through cliffs, eventually getting there to find nothing was happening, again.

I feel like we MUST have missed something, but in nearly 3 hours of play I had fun for only a few minutes - a couple of firefights with some faction that were apparently attacking a watchtower for some reason, and the first time I used a glider.

So please... what did I miss, and why would I boot this game up again? Is it really just running around a highly annoying map in search of the one or two things to do?

Most icons we were led to by the event notifiers (those we could actually reach before getting annoyed by the terrain and giving up) were just syncing with Sin to unlock a bit of the map. Nice, but not especially fun or challenging.

So, guys... help me out! What did I miss?!"	t5_2s629	True

1375797993.0	1jt7zb	Somewhere in the Melding... A Guide to Blackwater Anomaly (BWA)	KinokoSama	30	7	11	"Hi there Firefall friends!

I had just commented on a recent thread that someone needs to write a comprehensive BWA guide. After a bit of searching on the sub to see if there already was one, and finding nothing, I figured I may as well get one started. I'm going to try my best to keep this spoiler free, but consider yourself warned anyway!

First, I should mention that I only *just* got my BWA key on Saturday, and have only run the instance 4 times thus far, so I am no expert on the matter. I've done a little bit of research, but I will be very open to suggestions/edits. Tonight I may take a few screenshots to add some visual aid. This *will* be a long post, but it's a frickin' guide. Deal with it! 

Let's get started.
*****
###What is Blackwater Anomaly?

Blackwater Anomaly is the culmination of the Echoes from Sertao questline. After crafting your three Arcfold Modulators, entering the melding pockets, and completing each event therein *countless* times (or one time each, if you are incredibly lucky), you'll be able to craft the final modulator - the Chosen Arcfold Modulator - and gain entry to the anomaly. BWA could be considered the ""furthest"" progression content in the game at this point, along with Baneclaw.

In my opinion, a squad of 5 in stock gear can easily complete this instance as long as they have moderately good aim. Some recommend a minimum of stage 2 gear, I don't think this is necessary. 2-3 people in stage 3+ gear can probably finish the instance with relative ease.

###How does one get in to Blackwater Anomaly?

Crafting your own Chosen Arcfold Modulator is not required to be able to enter the instance. As long as your squad leader has their modulator, they can start the instance. You won't need to go anywhere or do anything! The squad leader uses the key, and the game starts a ""queue"" similar to a that of a PvP match.

If you are a keyholder, fret not that SIN is telling you that you must hoof it all the way to Trans Hub to use the Chosen Arcporter! You can start the instance right from Copacabana. Simply run to [the area behind Ratchet's shop](http://i.imgur.com/8elFMpW.jpg), look for a [door to an enclosed area](http://i.imgur.com/08FtPAw.jpg), and on a platform inside is a device that will bring up an interface similar to the PvP queue that will let you start the instance. Hopefully we see more areas added to this queue soon!

###What will I find inside?

Chosen... Lots of Chosen. The gameplay inside is fairly straightforward, as it handles like any other Ares mission. Just like Ares missions, though, the map is very open and there are many ways to go. Confusion could be a factor for players new to the area (as it was for me, even following an experienced squad leader).

The instance has 6 total events to complete, in what I would consider three ""stages"", along with an optional objective of collecting SIN Imprints. (links to maps below)

Also, strewn throughout the map you will find standard supply crates containing the usual Crystite, Medpacks, ammo, etc., as well as Rare supply crates containing bonus goodies. (link map w/ routes below)

###Stage 1 - The Repulsor:

When you first enter the area, you will have only one objective on your map. This is one very simple: get to that point, interact with the object, and defend the area for three minutes. Chosen will funnel in from 3 directions, just kill them as they come, easy! After three minutes is up, the Melding will be pushed back, this signifies the transition into...

###Stage 2 - The Disturbances:

Once the Melding gives way, Aero will add 3 more objectives to your map. The general consensus seems to be that running (as a group - non speed run) from West to East is the simplest way (see map below). The squad leader should be setting waypoints on the map, and the paths pretty much reveal themselves. [More detailed directions + pictures may be added eventually/if requested]

Remember, as always, don't fall into any deep water. You never learned to swim, you dumbass!

Each one of these objectives handles like a single Warbringer during a Sunken Harbor invasion. Simply destroy the pillar in the middle of the large object, jumpjet up in there, destroy three devices inside, then get the hell outta there, 'cause it's about to blow! Be wary of Elite Dreadnaughts/Juggernauts, and those stinking bifold cannons!

Rinse and repeat two more times as you move across the map, and then you will be able to move on to...

###Stage 3 - Climby Climberton and the Mysterious Anomaly:

The Melding gets pushed back a final time, and thus starts ***The Hill Climb***. This seems to be the part where most of my squadmates became disoriented, lost, confused, etc. 

From the Eastern side of the map, there is a path of hollow logs that you can follow that heads sort of Northwest-ish, that eventually leads to a path traversing the hillside up to the final area. Chosen will be along the path, and *many* more Chosen populate the final area itself. Simply kill everything you see; with fire, poison, electricity, or whatever you have at your disposal. Once the area is clear, interact with the 3 pillars, and then finally interact with the object that spawns in the center of the platform. This triggers the final event, too short to be considered its own stage but deserving of a heading nonetheless...

###The Daring Escape!!!!!!!:

If you wait around for who-knows-how-long, some glider pads will appear. Who the hell has time for that, though? Drop your own pad (or let a squadmate drop one) on top of the big-ass horizontal log, jump on it, and glide allllllll the way back down to where the very first 3-minute event took place. Board the dropship once you get there, and that's it! Congratulations! You've completed Blackwater Anomaly! You've just netted yourself ~70k XP, ~3k (probably more) Crystite, ~4k (probably more) various resources, and possibly a few dropped items!

If your squad managed to do the whole thing in under 25 minutes without anyone Double-Dying (becoming incapacitated, then releasing or being killed again without a rez), you'll have unlocked a new facemask that you can equip in New You!

Oh, and hopefully you managed to grab all of the SIN Imprints, because if you wanted a slick new warpaint, you're gonna have to do that again 19 more times!

###Wait, what was that about SIN Imprints?

Oh, right. Those things. There are 5 of them in BWA.

[Here](http://imgur.com/yPvod5j) is a handy map I've found showing the crashed dropships which are possible SIN Imprint spawn locations! [Credit goes to Sh0ppingList of the Firefall forums] The dropship all the way to the West in the lower portion of the map may never spawn a SIN Imprint. Some on the forum have said they have seen one there, so I'll leave this map just in case.

But [HERE](http://imgur.com/ct4CaVb) is a map with a ***TON*** of information on it.  [Credit for this one goes to DasBaum of the Firefall forums ([link to forum post](http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/blackwater-map-sin-imprints-rare-crates.1005341/))]:
  
* Follow the grey route to find ***everything*** - rare supply crates, SIN Imprints, and objectives; 
* Follow the blue route for objectives and SIN Imprints only; 
* Follow the purple route for objectives only.

[Thanks to /u/asmodaeius for the clarification]

###What about speed runs?!

I'm glad you asked. You may have seen /u/MannerRev's [post](http://redd.it/1jt0j6) showing an elapsed time of 9 minutes and 48 seconds! Whoah! As for how this is accomplished, I'll simply quote him in his reply to my query:

&gt;We do a 3-way split. After the repulsor, one goes west, one central, and one east. Two other people can just sit around and do nothing, since we really only need 3 people. They can also help out at other disturbances if someone's having trouble alone.

&gt;After the disturbances, we skip as much as possible of the last area before the Anomaly. Just hit the 3 terminals and grab the Anomaly, run out. Use defensive cooldowns to stay alive while everything beats on you.

On the reasoning behind speed runs:

&gt;I believe the break point is such that if your BWA runs are &gt;14 minutes, you may as well just spam ARES missions for the highest CY/hr.

&gt;Under 14 minute runs and you're starting to break even, and I'm 99.9% sure if your BWA runs are sub-11min, it's the highest spammable CY/hr in the game. It's also pretty damn good XP and resources too, but that's not why I run it.

&gt;I really don't care for drops at all. Barely clear anything. Not sure why it says 226 enemies killed, actually. I think that might count the explosions from the disturbances when destroyed, because I literally just run past everything.

*****
###And there you have it!

That's about all I can think to add at this point. I hope someone finds this useful, as I surely would have a few days ago. I even learned a thing or two in writing/researching this. As I said, if anyone has anything that should be added, make it known in the comments. And again, screenshots may be added soon. Oh, and if anyone wants to run BWA with me - I'm Hyzenthlay on NA (usually on the US East-1 shard), and I'm currently working on maxing my Dragonfly. Also, I'm incredibly attractive.

1366906846.0	1d39wa	First impressions from a group of new players	YouWinAgainGravity	24	2	22	"Myself and four friends decided to give Firefall a try last night. We
had an absolute blast! We were instantly hopping in on some huge
Thumping parties, pushing chosen back from a tower and just generally
exploring. I thought I would share our feedback here.


**What we loved:**

- It's so easy to jump in with friends and just PLAY. The squad system
was a breeze and its nice and easy to find squadmates on the map.

- There is a great cooperative atmosphere about the game. I love how
easy it is to just jump into a fight with a stranger and everyone
benefits.
- Easily to most fun I've ever had collecting resources in a game.

- We love how fluid the gameplay is. You are just flowing from dynamic
quest, to thumper, to quest and the hours fly by.

- The core gameplay mechanics were something all of us could grasp
instantly. Fly, shoot, get loot.

- The crafting system seems to have a decent level of depth to it. I
already want to try rebuilding some items to see the different
results.

- Its incredibly stable. 4 different rigs, 4 hours of gameplay and not
a single crash or complaint of lag.


**What we didn't:**

- Obviously the crafting system is a WIP. Right now its not a learning
curve, its a sharp cliff and then a plateau. Once you figure the
system out it doesn't seem like there is much more to add to it
besides quality and material type. I found myself using Eve Online
references to explain the system and that should raise a red flag.
There are a number of ""AH-HA"" moments before you figure how the whole
system links together.

- Being able to click on subcomponents and jumping right to their
crafting requirements would be great.

- With crafting being so important (and timers forcing you to leave
and come back) I wouldn't mind seeing molecular ""pickup"" stations so I
don't have to travel back to town to pick up that gun 13 minutes
later. Keep me in the loop of exploring, questing and thumping.

- Its tough to find a downed friendly in the chaos of a thumper drop.
A more more noticeable icon over them would be a huge asset.

- Dynamic quests could use more to make them less rinse and repeat. A
chance to spawn a mini-boss or a chance to spawn a dynamic arcing
quest that takes you further into the map and possibly into the
melding.

- Manufacturing tokens to get access to tier II battleframes seems
disjointed from the rest of the systems in the game. The process of
manufacturing tokens from medals from awards from points (etc) also
seems needlessly complex. Perhaps we're just not grasping the system
completely.

- Its not readily apparent what resource refining II-IV do. Perhaps
someone here can answer that.



Overall impressions were excellent. We were looking for a persistent
game that we could all play regardless of how many hours each person
puts into it and this might just be the one! Keep it up Red 5!"	t5_2s629	True

1375738618.0	1jrngr	Horizontal Progression, and how I play the game.	Redrumed	20	1	14	"I play Firefall because I believe it is a a unique and interesting game.  What sets this game apart from the others I have played is that it has taken a 'Horizontal' approach to progression.  I want to take a moment to discuss this and hopefully help explain it to people who may be struggling with the concept. 

 In alot of games people see xp increasing their level giving them access to a techtree of some sort or an ever increasing list of abilities.

In Firefall this does not happen. This game takes that xp and gives you the option of what to do with it.  You have choices and lots of research to do. 

Doing the research gives you access to make higher level items, a lot of which can be used on multiple frames.

Xp also can be used to increases your frames ability to use the more advanced items you make.

Basically, The hardest the game is going to be is when you start in stock gear.  Advancing your frame can change the abilities and alter subtle changes in what your frame does. This creates a Personalized style of play.

Lets say you start with the accord assault.  Great mobility makes the map a little more forgiving. Now, you have played the assault for a while and increased its capacity to t3 items, you researched some things up but not all. After trying out some of the other frames you finally gained enough pilot tokens to unlock a new frame.

Now you think ""oh man I'm going to lose all that progression"".

THIS IS NOT TRUE.

What sets Firefall apart is that so much is shared across your account.  People seem to be stuck on looking at frames as character.  They are not!  Shared battle frame equipment (plating, servos,jump jets), resource refining research, thumper research, Secondary weapons, and even abilities from accord frames can be shared with their 'advanced' versions.

None of this was lost, and some can even be put on the new frame as soon as it is able.

You also did not lose your knowledge.  I am sure ARES missions are twice as easy because you now know what your doing. The gear is not what makes you better, you skill is.

Basically what I want people to understand is that this game is to be enjoyed.  The content is still being written and we have a chance to give feedback to make this game better. You cant beat the fact that your friends can download the game and play it with you right away.  They don't have to catch up or do endless quests, you can play right now, take them to get sin towers and ares along the way.

You don't NEED t4 gear, and by the time you can wear it you will have more than enough to craft it.  The fact that people have it is a testament to show that their is plenty to do right now.  It starts with research and 1 frame but it doesn't end when you get 10/10/10.   Your skill and knowledge are what improve and make you better.  Not Equipment. 

Hit those Sin towers so you can see the map and start you journey.  Save up for the arcport's  and find a frame that suits your style.  

Have fun, build friendships, and kill chosen.

I have some [Firefall Founders](http://beta.firefallthegame.com/founders) cards I'd like to give away to you guys for being such a great community. I have one of each level: Commander, Lieutenant, and Ensign. 

I've picked 3 numbers at random between 0 and 1000, each one corresponding to one of the cards. First one to guess a number, or whoever comes closest after a few days, will get it. (I will PM you to code [to enter](https://beta.firefallthegame.com/founders/redeem)) I figured this was the best way to do this fairly. Happy guessing!

This is not an official Red5 sponsored contest or promotion in any way shape or form, and Red5 is not responsible for any liabilities that may arise.

*Please don't post multiple times, don't post more then one number - if you do, I will ignore all your guesses. Don't up or downvote anyone else's number posts please. If you already purchased a founders pack, please don't guess. Don't PM me asking to sell these at a discount or any other zany offers*

Really happy Red5 and Mark Kern stands firm in the never-ending struggle for a free internet. It's nice to see when someone stands up for their beliefs. 

Red5 have in a short timespan become one of my favourite game developers. And with this statement they have a solid place there, even if Firefall would fail they would keep it. Cannot say that about many developers...

Still I cannot stop feeling a little bit sad, conferences like E3 have a tendency to give us lots of never before seen information. But on the other hand - they can work on Firefall instead :D"	t5_2s629	True

Kryyss	26	6	28	"One of the main questions on new players lips, when they start playing Firefall, is going to be; How do I get rich fast? With the new patch coming in next week the quantity of features and functions that are going to require crystite will shoot through the roof. Weapon unlocks, research into new nanoprints, the eventual need to pay for repairs rather than having them free and many things which we probably don't even know about yet. But while there are suspicions as to what activities have the highest payout there needs to be some study done into the scale of what is 'better' for making Crystite. 

In the new guide we look at data pulled from experiments on the servers to see how rewarding various tasks are. Are the Chosen Incursions really worth the effort? Should players be running Thumpers solo because it is faster and more rewarding? Check out the [new guide](http://www.rawr4firefall.com/?q=guide-making-money-fast) to find out what we discovered."	t5_2s629	True

My name is Capt. McGruff, from the Copa Cabana PD.


I'm here to warn about about a new threat to our society. One bigger than the melding and the chosen. A threat so large that it strikes at the heart of our communities. I'm talking about the dangerous game of thumper chicken!


During a thumper run, adrenaline junkie might be tempted to stand right under a dropping thumper and see who gets out of the way last. It's a dangerous game with deadly consequence! A dropping LT will take out a TerrorClaw in a single strike. It can easily take you out as well, leaving your teamates struggling to revive you or at worst, with one less gun to defend the thumper.


Just say no to thumper chicken! :p

1336670620.0	tgqw3	Patch notes 10may2012	Hoder_	19	0	47	"**General Game Changes**




Increased the health of the MPU on the mission ""A River Runs Through It"".

Increased the health of the thumper by ~50%.

Blackwater Harvester will now start at 24 players instead of 30.

NPCs should no longer be afraid their souls will be removed when going through friendly forcefields.

Multiple navigation changes to NPCs to prevent some of the more egregious issues with wandering people.

Modifications to NPC creature behaviors to hopefully be a little more dynamic.

Aranha will now be less likely to stick inside their own homes.

Whiptail Threshers have had their hit points reduced slightly.

Another battle won by Red 5 in the never-ending war of frames per second.

Removed the steam particles shooting out of the smokestacks on Point A in Orbital Comm Tower as they were reducing framerate.

Reduced the overall size of the downloaded client by moving more textures into virtual textures that are streamed the first time you see them.

You can control your streaming texture settings in the Network options dialog.

Setting the network speed will only affect the prioritization of streaming textures.

The iron sights on the Assault Rifle no longer shimmer while looking at water.

Hacking the Orbital Comm Tower terminal should now be a bit more consistent.

Rocks and shrubbery have had their combat abilities reduced.




**UI Changes**




Changed the fonts used in multiple UI components to be more readable.

Multiple organizational changes to UI code and files (FYI to all you LUA hackers).

Unread notifications will now pulse on the UI to let you know you need to give them attention.

Changed keybind icons to use images instead of just a letter.

You can now tell if someone is mentally ignoring your whispers. We now notify you if the player is offline or AFK.


**Combat Changes**




Battleframe energy is now set to 0 when switching between frames. 

Recharge should begin immediately.

Slightly reduced unsquadded non-critical assist XP.

The Recon Sniper rifle now takes 500ms to reach perfect accuracy when changing between unscoped and scoped.

This is being done to prevent perfectly accurate quick-scoping shots.

The Recon Marksman rifle will lose accuracy the more rapidly you fire it while in unscoped mode.

The Marksman rifle is still perfectly accurate in scoped mode.

The Recon ability Cryo Shot will now remove double damage from an opponent on impact.

Engineer deployable Repair Station Tier II upgraded to tech II and III now properly give nearby allies ammunition.

Abilities with knockback again actually knock back instead of up.




**Crafting and Item Changes**




All refining research has a new prerequisite of the previous refining process.

The original refining process will be returned after researching the new process.

Changed crit chance of gear nanoprints to 15% for uncommon, 10% for rare (removed level scaling for crit chance).

Reduced Rare Refining (Brimstone) times by ~30%.

Adjusted costs on most nanoprints

Refined resources are required in lower level gear.

Generally gear items cost fewer resources

Module items cost a bit more resources.

Decreased coralite received from static deposits by ~50%.

It was more efficient to use sonic detonators than a thumper.

Increased overall drop rates by 100%.

Level 9,12 and 15 encrypted nanoprint decryption prices have been reduced significantly.

New rare Level 15 decrypted nanoprints have been added to vendors for players who are willing to pay more to know the type of item they are getting.

Uncommon encrypted nanoprints have been added to the encrypted nanoprint vendors. They cost a fraction of the crystite compared to Rare prints.




**Bug Fixes**




Fixed issues with the TAB screen remaining after leaving a PvP match.

Fixed a bug where squads would get split onto opposite teams in PvP.

Fixed the NavWheel Invite Squad option so that it properly fills the chat box with the command needed.

Fixed issues with the wrong resolutions being used when selecting resolutions in the Video Options.

Fixed loot info cards getting stuck on the screen.

Fixed the scoreboard breaking if you used reloadui during the middle of a match.

Fixed an issue with match countdown not matching up with the actual match start.

Fixed issues with the reticle sometimes disappearing.

Fix for video settings getting reset after logging out.

Fix for UI clumping text at the tops &amp; bottoms of text widgets when scrolling quickly.

1375105020.0	1j9woh	I got the first component of my BWA key last night! Observations and questions inside.	KinokoSama	22	5	18	"First of all, many thanks to everyone that showed up in Diamondhead last night, if any of you were there! I had loads of fun.

Around 8PM EST, I got an invitation from one of my Firefall friends asking if I wanted to help do the event in Diamondhead. Once I managed to join his shard and enter the instance, I was very surprised to find 9+ people inside, raring to go! Without much fuss, we pushed back the melding and started the event. We failed the first try as we were a bit disorganized, but after that one we managed to complete the event maybe 5 times in a row.... with no one getting anything. :( 

We eventually failed another try for some unknown reason. (I honestly think the game glitched out a bit, because where I was up on the furthest ledge, a HUGE pack of forgotten ones spawned out of nowhere). However, the next shot went off without a hitch once again, and when it was over, Zone chat was filled with resounding cries of exultation. We had gotten our pieces, Aero and Oilspill told us we should now head to Thump Dump or Sunken Harbor to continue. Huzzah!

Some random notes and things I learned:

* Bastions can actually heal the shield generators with their Tesla rifle alt-fire. It is slow as all hell, but it does work.
* We had four people total on the top ledge(s), which seemed to be sufficient for the most part. Two were along the right-side ledge (if you were looking in to the area from the entrance), with myself (Bastion) on the ledge all the way in the rear, and then we had a Firecat ""floating"" between the two spots, helping to clean up. Everyone else was on the ground.
* Elite Juggernauts are scary, and snipers are super annoying with their damned melding portals.
* You can feed the Repulsor more Melded Crystite to extend the time.

Questions:

1. Some in the group were saying that Diamondhead's event is the ""most annoying"" in that you can do it upwards of 20 times without seeing a key fragment. Is this true? Do the other areas have higher drop rates?
2. I'm almost certain that I had read on more than one website/blog that it's possible to solo these events...... WHAT? HOW?! Seriously? We had, as I said, 9 people at the start. More may have joined for further attempts... This seemed like a pretty good amount, but I can't see being able to complete the event with less than 5 people...
3. Are the events in the other areas essentially the same? Defend a location for ~5 minutes? Are they harder? Easier?
4. How hard is BWA itself?

I had a great time running last night. It was a lot of fun, very rewarding as far as high-quality resources and chosen tech goes! Not the most efficient XP, however. Hopefully I can join another large group for the remaining two areas! If anyone wants to add me, my IGN is Hyzenthlay. I'm currently most-progressed on Bastion, with T8 CPUs (working on crafting a nice Multi Turret III), but my Dragonfly is only just behind."	t5_2s629	True
1374681041.0	1iymyu	How can I enjoy Firefall?	Stuveya	25	8	60	"So, I have been playing this game for two weeks now. I main nighthawk. In fact, I only use nighthawk.  I have not been playing it like nonstop, because I cannot enjoy the game so much. What am I doing wrong? Now, here's what I usually do in FF everytime I play from the most to least:
-Ares missions
-Global stuff, can't remember the actual name, but you know what I mean, crashed thumpers, Chosen stuff etc.
-PvP, once or twice a day. 
-Thumping, once or twice a day.

So, once we're here, let me explain you the problems of everything I do:
-Ares missions, they get boring after a while (5-6), and the aranha ares missions are really boring and stupid to do as nighthawk. (Is there by the way a way to know if there are Chosen's or aranha's in the Ares mission?)
-Global stuff, my FPS drops in every large event, and there are not always any global stuff, or they are too far for me to go there in time. 
-PvP, nighthawk is kinda bad in PvP, and I don't enjoy playing any other class than nighthawk. 
-Thumping, is overall boring and dull, just stand in one spot and wait for the creeps to spawn and shoot 'em. 

Please help me with my problem, because I really feel like Firefall would be an phenomenal game. And If some of you were thinking that ""MMORPG is just not the game for you man"", that is not true. I have played many MMORPG's before, and enjoyed them a lot. 

TL;DR: I don't enjoy Firefall as much as I feel I could. What could I do to enjoy it?

EDIT: So, I updated my drivers and my fps is working good now. Also, I tried out assault again, and I really like it. :) Thanks guys.

But I was thinking ""whelp teleporting would be too easy, wouldn't it be cool if we could incorporate some kind of skill and fun into it?"" and it came to me, gliders. In a few different games they have those ring challenges where you fly through them to earn points, well I was thinking what if they did the rings, but when you hit one maybe you get a 3 second afterburner or something, at which point you could gain some altitude and glide on to the next ring in a line towards the city you selected. We could have a timer on it as well as an area you need to stay in to keep the rings active, so players don't use this like the LGV races just to get a free speed ride. They could do it so there are maybe 3 different layouts of rings, so flying from copa to sunken harbor the rings won't be in the same place every time. This rewards player skill, fixes a question most new players ask, and plays on one of the most fun parts of the game.

Steps:

* press alt-f1 to open console
* type in replay_record_begin (starts replay)
* can close console by pressing alt-f1 again or leave open
* type in replay_record_end (finishes replay)

You can view the replay in two ways:

* (opens up a new game client dedicated to replay). Accessing the replay file and running it. its usually located in users/videos/firefall directory and you double click on the .nsr file
* (uses current game client). Accessing the console again and typing replay_playback_begin and selecting the replay file from the list shown in the console, this uses the main game window and thus logs you out of your current play session. You can close the console at any point after the replay loads.


Some simple options:

* use wasd to navigate on the 2d plane
* use jump (space) to go up and crouch (ctrl) to go down.
* Use the playback menu, which has the normal playback options.
* Use Q and E to jump to different players and F to return to the last selected player (assuming you navigate somewhere else).

I was looking at the XP/resource requirements and thinking, that's pretty steep but I think I can swing it eventually.  Then once I saw how much the Dreadnaught Dampeners are (10k Crystite, 5k Ceramic each, need 18 total) my will to keep progressing or playing PVE is basically broken.  I need Crystite for research/building/crafting and to buy any equipment off the market.  Getting that much Ceramic likely means way too much thumping specifically for it.

Naturally I started looking at starter packs and Red Beans to see if there was a way around it by paying.  There doesn't appear to be.  I also didn't like what I found there.  I know they are supposed to keep adding frames so I'll either need to grind or pay in the future to have many frames available for PVP (my main interest in Firefall).  The problem is the only pricing that makes a lot of sense is going in for $100 starter pack and then buying $100 of Red Beans for future frame purchases.  That's very steep considering what Firefall is thus far.  I love Jetball but the rest of PVP doesn't do anything for me and while PVE is fun it gets repetitive.  I feel like I can't grind out frames reasonably (way worse than Tribes Ascend or MWO) and I can't buy them at a decent price either.  I did unlock 20 Pilot Tokens easily enough but after that it gets a lot harder and slower.

I wasn't understanding why this game seemed unpopular despite being fun but once I hit this wall so to speak I see why.  The grind is ridiculous and the prices are too.  It's a shame.  I was extremely interested in Firefall (even trying to form a Jetball team) but now I've lost a lot of interest and not sure if I'll continue playing."	t5_2s629	True

Except for CAL, leagues weren't actually leagues. They were just events that had no bearing from one to the other. An obvious example of this is the current scene with SC2. MLG has no effect on IPL, IPL has no effect on ESL and so on. But SC2 has been around a while and that change will be harder to implement. Where Firefall is still young I would like to promote an idea.

A long term formatted league.

Currently, we have R5, Brontodon, and LimeLight getting involved in the tournament scene and because the scene is so young, rankings from one game to there other may or may not have bearing on how teams are matched up. I would like to propose an actual long term league where teams compete twice, maybe 3 times a week. Teams would face one opponent each day and the win/loss would be reported as well as the other stats K/D/A that can be used in a database of stats. This would benefit the community as a whole because that ranking can be used to assign seeds during tournaments. Also, the consistent play on the team base will give R5 plenty of information about balancing PvP on a team basis, as opposed to Pubs.

I'm bringing this up to the general public because I can't do it alone. I'm going to need the help of current teams (no matter the vet status) to build it up properly and get rules established. I need help from current tournament organizers so we can get it all organized and we are all on board for this type of system. I also need help from the community: artists for streams, programmers for data management, casters (not just Nero, caster fatigue is killer) for recording and streaming.

I've been doing eSports since SC2 was in beta (~2yrs) and been lucky enough to experience some of the ""old dog"" antics that can really kill the sport. So what do you say, are you with me?

If you are, could I have the cpt of all the teams contact me with your skype/email info so that we can draft something up? This takes a lot of work, but believe me, it's worth it in the end."	t5_2s629	True

1369025899.0	1eody7	My 1 Year Review	zVulture	18	3	22	"[Posted on the forums here](http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/my-1-year-review.335842/), but below is the full text (a bit long):

I joined beta about a month after Open World Beta was first released. Seen, used, cursed and abused the many bugs and exploits the game had to offer among it's features. I have dropped at the least 500ish thumpers in that time, mostly played PvE and been an active part of the community as a user and then mod of /r/firefall on Reddit. I was there for the reveal of the Firefall Bus at Anime Expo. I have posted, commented and helped all I can to help improve the game and it's users. Paid my support with a Commander Pack and organized army events. But in all of this, was it worth the time, effort and costs and will I continue? That is the question.

From the moment I stepped into the game I was drawn in by the beautiful world and the mobility of jetpack and glider to explore it. The enemies felt they fit into that alien world that was still our 'home' and it really put me in that futuristic world. From then, the scenery has only improved as more details get developed and areas get expanded. Only the melding now holds me back from discovering new scenes as I have glided, teleported, jetpacked or otherwise gotten myself up any mountain. There is little left to explore in this world.

At first there were a few minor quests just to wet the tong. A few more were added later but it has always been a sore lacking feature of the world. That wasn't all what the game was aimed toward though so it was a forgivable downside. Who follows the main storyline of an Elder Scrolls game anyway when there is a world to explore?

At first the game held amazing potential and I stayed through bugs and patches to keep testing out the system. The willingness to scrap what was made to find a better approach was unique in a developing game (or at least a public one like this). This has been both a blessing and a curse as improvements was not new content. Small things were added over time, events like the Meld Twister added a lot more to the game to hold both interest and expectations. After a year of updates, I have yet to find an end goal of the game.

Extra Credits did a video recently (http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/the-jc-pennys-effect) that really went over this 'issue'. The system isn't made like a normal Shooter or RPG that rewards you with unlocks or gear. Instead you collect resources with the goal to build an item or unlock a constraint. The big issue arises then just what do those do for you? Let you kill/thump all the better to collect more resources to get more items to thump better and well you get the point. The game has no big goal, it's just a sandbox for the systems and mechanics.

In a years time, I still can't push the melding back to reclaim the lost lands that have been given. Achievement progress doesn't stay over between sessions or even shards. There are no rewards to playing the game until recently with the beta crystite vendor. Though for someone playing as long myself, those are already bought and of no further concern. I still see the potential of this game but I am already burnt out of dropping thumpers and fighting chosen for towers they will just take back. I understand that the game is in 'beta' but really there is only so much one person can playtest over and over before getting bored.

These last two months I have only found pleasure in organizing larger events like Heavy Squad Meld Thumping but now that was taken from me with the latest resource changes. Constraints are as unrewarding an unlock as it can get and the T2 weapons require so many varied resources it would take months of thumping to get the right ones at a rare value. No trading has also hampered this effort even further. I am left with just more and more frustrations that I can go on for paragraphs about them.

From here, I plan to continue to impartially mod /r/firefall and help there where I can. But now it's turned into a Minecraft release cycle of interest. I will play with the new toys every patch for a day or so before waiting another month or three for the next big release. While I have probably gotten my moneys worth from the commanders pack, I just hope things progress to where the game is enjoyable again so I can use it. "	t5_2s629	True

So there was a discussion on Saturday's F:COM (FFANZ meeting) regarding what kinds of walls are slowing players progress down for Battleframe progression.  What we have been seeing is that players with a few frames going into T8+ unlocks have quickly run out of Accord Merrit Points.  Crystite and XP are easy enough to get but that AMP Wall seems to be the long standing block.

I am not saying there shouldn't be a wall, but instead it's a question if Red5 intends that to be the 'wall' for battleframes.  As such, I wanted to know what is your current challenge for progressing your frame?

Also, my thoughts on the possible 'Walls' that the game has:

AMP Wall
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose XP, Crystite and Resources for doing other things.
- Disadvantage - Forces players to farm ARES missions and similar events.
- Numbers: 1350 AMPs are needed for 1 full frame unlock.  At even 2 AMPs per mission (not always true), that's still over 600 missions.
- Suggestion 1: Add AMPs to 100% full (Squad???) thumper rewards (at 6 min per thumper that's 10 AMPs per hour).  Rewards players who drop thumpers.
- Suggestion 2: Reduce costs of AMP items by about 1/5th (make the 45 costing item go down to 30 or 35?)

XP Wall 
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose Crystite and Resources, Users can purchase Boosters from store to close gap.  PvP XP will draw more players to public matches.
- Disadvantage - Leaves spare AMPs that currently is only good for Resonators (Benefit: Resonators give XP so...)

Crystite Wall
- Disadvantage - Too many, Crysttie is used too much for crafting and market purchases.  This shouldn't be used as a Wall.

Resources Wall
- Advantage - Leaves room for loose XP, Crystite, and AMPs
- Disadvantage - Grinding out resources generally is boring, buying resources off market would make another Crystite Shortage for users.

Final Thoughts:
AMP wall or XP wall seem the best course for the game.  Both have their uses but currently AMPs are just a pain to farm/grind while XP is easier to acquire in all aspects of the game (including PvP)."	t5_2s629	True

I struggle with this feature, primarily because it doesn't feel like it ""fits"" in a game with gameplay like this. On the other hand, as someone who played EVE Online for many, many years, permanent item loss is something that I'm *very* familiar with.  That being said, I feel like the ""blow"" of losing an item permanently could be significantly softened by the following 3 things:

**Display the total repair pool, not just the durability.**

* Maybe it is there, but I just can't find it. I searched for it for a while, too!
* Knowing how many more times I can repair a module will allow me to plan in advance for the necessary resources (or seek out higher quality ones), assuming I don't have enough already.
* Brings the item decay system to the forefront of the core gameplay loop, so players know what they are getting into immediately upon crafting an item.

**Make crafting a new item *not* involve digging to the bottom of a collapsing drop down menu.**

* The current crafting menu, while a vast improvement over the previous one, is still pretty abysmal from a functionality standpoint. For example, to craft a new item, I must first find the item in the list so that I can then discover the components it requires. Then, I must either visually scan (or use the search bar) to find the specific item. After setting the item up with resources to craft it, I must repeat that whole process for the **next** component.
* Instead, allow us to ""go deeper"" into a given module, down to the component construction level, via interacting with the component listed in the module manufacturing screen. For example, in order to craft an ""Explosive Payload"" that I need for a Recon Decoy, I should just be able to click the Explosive Payload component to bring up the resource selection window, then click a button that takes me to that component's manufacturing menu. Once that is set up, I should be able to return to the main module via a back button of some sort (like a web browser).
* Automate the crafting process. Once an item has been crafted once, allow us to craft it again with one button click. Ideally this would be a separate list of ""known recipes."" If we have enough of each required resource, the crafting system should automatically pick the best ones available (along with any available additional components like stabilizers etc). It should then report the final stats outcome (along with which quality resources it's using) for approval for the player to confirm and start the process. Naturally, the tradeoff for this could be increased manufacturing time (but components only take like 5s to put together anyway).

**Categorize our equipment and modules in our inventory the same way that resources are categorized.**

* Pretty straightforward. Basically line them out under Assault/Recon/Dreadnaught/Engineer/Biotech. This will make it easier to take stock of any extra modules I may have in my back pocket because I forgot I built them (which happens! it's not just me, I swear!). 
* This will also more easily show me what quality levels of modules I have available to me should I need an emergency fallback item while I wait for a new/better version to complete manufacturing.

**TL;DR:** This is a list of ideas on how to improve the game in ways that will improve UX with permanent item loss."	t5_2s629	True

But before that, he gave me a beta invite. (Which was sent to the wrong e-mail, but that was resolved later.) The reason was because of my etiquette and typing skills.

*I'll admit, at first I was overwhelmed.*  I was overwhelmed with the crafting, and the amount of crafting &amp; resources required for progression.  **It really seemed like a nigh unobtainable goal...**  At first, I was hurt, wounded even, that all of my time &amp; experience and pre .6 minerals were nigh useless...  I couldn't progress past the white blocks despite my wild desire to immediately unlock the frame as fully as possible.  *I too felt perhaps we had been n00b-tubed...*  **But then, I came to realize that as always with the process of creation, I wasn't stunted at all, in fact I had just as much power as before, if not more...** *What really made me feel smaller, was the new creation of new systems that were so vast and overwhelming, my head was spinning out of control.  I didn't know where I should go, or what I should do, I didn't understand what they wanted from me,  I thought I may never know the answer to this endless mystery...*

**Then I put on my robe &amp; wizard hat, pulled that arrow out of my knee, cleaned &amp; refitted power sources for my jumpjets &amp; weapon systems, fired up my battleframe cocked, locked &amp; ready to rock &amp; set out to blaze a new trail through the newly created system...**

**Damn am I glad that I did!**

Just like SWG (which I absolutely loved) the crafting system may be a bit too daunting or creative with nigh-endless proliferation of options for certain players of certain mindsets. **And that's OK**, *as long as trading is introduced and those players can work closely with players like myself who* **ABSOLUTELY LOVE** *the new crafting system in all it's glorious complexity with days and weeks of things to print and discover...*  I think feedback from players needs to be carefully seperated into groups of players who do have crafting experience, and those who dont, similar to the survey I recieved, i think that's a smart idea.   I also think we need more time to spend on crafting for additional feedback, but there are definently some areas that need to be addressed ASAP.

*Again, I absolutely love the new crafting system and can't wait to help see it refined to fill out the new awesome potential that was unleashed with patch 0.6 (especially after the hotfix, baby!),* **but as always with new creation, comes a host of new issues...**

The thread comments will be open to the crafting system &amp; feedback, as well as it's relation to the progression system.  Please state whether or not you are an active crafter in the new system, old system, &amp;/or any crafting experience you have in other games (especially SWG)

The suggestion for crafting improvements I have are as follows (and i think some of them are already being worked on) :

* **1) Mobile Printing!**  In the age of the S.I.N., with oilspill doing all the legwork anyways, it only makes sense that we can access printer workbenches from anywhere in the game, especially with the increased amount of printing time now required.  It seems to make more sense with the continuity of the game anways, to me your inventory is just a representation of your warehouse where all those thousands of minerals and DNA/technology and calldowns/consumeables are stored... Your not really running around with all that stuff, thats why it's all call downs, and gets arcfolded right to you or dropped like a thumper...  *MOBILE PRINTING SUGGESTION BROUGHT TO YOU BY TREEZAT &amp; DHAC, APPROVED BY SKARTH &amp; YOUNGBLOOD &amp; THE BB COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF MOJO WHO WILL REMAIN ANONYMOUS BUT KNOW WHO THEY ARE*

* **2)** *speaking of saving time while printing:* **Multiple print queuing!**  let us make x amount of components &amp;/or subcomponents in order as long as we have the resources, and just que the time up or automatically consecutively run the print jobs, like a print spooler...  this way we can load the printers up with the boring stuff while we are off to work or sleep...  (i know, real adventurers don't need sleep)

**EDIT: UPDATE - patch 0.6.1597 released yesterday 4/4/13 appears to have introduced multiple resource refining for raw resources, and i think we can really start to see where they are going with being able to print multiple things at once... even further, they cut combine &amp; crafting times for battleframe related gear in HALF! woot!**

* **3)** *speaking more of printing on the go:* what about a remote access to the backend printer web interface via website &amp;/or mobile app?  This way you can print anytime from any device... This may be an excellent opportunity for a subscription service &amp;/or additional micro-transactions so the developers can afford to feed their families...

I think these are some pretty viable solutions for some of the major concerns regarding the new extensive amounts of print time taking away from the experience of adventure &amp; exploration in the game.  With trading introduced, players who don't want to print won't have to, with these suggested solutions, players who prefer to adventure can still keep their footing with the print-nerds like me...

**I'm also looking forward to the later stages of crafting, with experimentation on recipes by using different color/type/quality crystite modules &amp; different types of DNA or chosen tech parts, recovered accord parts, etc.  experimentation was one of my favorite parts of SWG crafting...**

*Finally the rate at which resources of all types are obtained is obviously relavent to this thread, but i almost feel thumpers/thumping especially may need an entire thread of it's own, however please feel free to address concerns here.  I do believe thumper difficulty and haul rates are being tweaked/adjusted based on player feedback.*

**Hope to hear from some brother crafters &amp; fellow firefall community supporters!**

1362719499.0	19w9d2	What would you like to see implemented in Firefall?	martialfarts316	15	2	59	"Hey guys, I was just wondering what all of you are anticipating/hoping for in the coming patches and updates. 

1. What *planned* feature/change/update would you like to see in the next content patch if the development time for it was not an issue?

2. What *unplanned/unannounced* feature/change/update would you want to be implemented into Firefall in general?

For me:

**1.** A solid tutorial quest line. The one currently implemented is nearly impossible to get through without experiencing one of the missions in the tutorial bugging out, not allowing completion, or even disappearing completely. This results in many new players resorting to asking the community simple questions about the game that should have been covered in a tutorial or (like all of my friends I introduced the game to) quitting out of frustration or boredom. I would **really** like to see Red5 address this.


**2.** More variety in gameplay. As of right now, not including the bugged missions and PVP, the only thing to really do in the game is Thump, Dynamic Events, Chosen, and Baneclaw. Though most of these missions have the same formula with a small mix thrown in; protect x until y happens. Thumpers, Watchtowers, LGV data recovery, and Downed Thumpers all require you to protect something until something is completed (usually time). The only exceptions to these are Melding Tornadoes, Baneclaw, LGV Race, and the Antenna quest(?), Though these become very repetitive or are few and far in between. Don't get me wrong, these are a blast to play (even mores so with friends) and I know it's still beta, but I just can't help feeling like I'm just doing the same thing over and over with a different name. It would be refreshing to see some more variety added to the game.

**EDIT: For those who are Founders, please take the time to check your e-mail and fill out the Firefall survey. They are asking what you like about the game and also what you would want to see in the game. So this is your chance to make your voice heard! Get out there and survey!!**"	t5_2s629	True

 Bug Fixes

        Fixed more issues of reticles disappearing.
        Aranha nests and Coralite nodes should no longer appear in the tunnel between Trans Hub and Copacabana.
        Thumpers have had their phase-shifting abilities nerfed and are no longer able to hide inside certain rocks.
        Fixed issues with the client minimizing after changing video resolutions.
        Fixed various floating rocks and vines throughout the world.
        Modified NPC pathing to prevent issues of the NPCs getting stuck in locations.
        Closed more holes that allowed you inside the Trans Hub hangar.
        Fixed an issue where the hacking team would receive XP rewards for the counter hack.
        Fixed ways that players were able to get more manufacturing slots than they were supposed to have.
        Fixed inventory freezes when removing gear.
        Fixed issues with the Engineer wrench count not updating on the UI.
        Fix for that weird black rectangle that always appears over the Accord splash screen at login that nobody talks about but everyone sees.
        Fixes for respawning with weird ammo counts.
        Fixed multiple client crash issues.
        Fixed particle lights not being cleaned up at low lighting quality settings which caused performance degradation over time.


    Game Changes

        PvP matches will now reward loot that matches the level of the battleframe that you're wearing when the match ends.
            Only winning teams receive loot.
        Players must do at least 20% of the damage on a target in order to receive an assist XP reward.
        Accuracy, Defense, Rate of Fire, and Crit modules have all had their bonuses halved across the quality levels.
        Medic's Heal Grenade alt-fire will now only heal the medic if a friendly is within the splash radius.
        Medic's Heal Gun will now use the Medic's Rate of Fire instead of the target's Rate of Fire (thanks tdopz).
        Recon's Sniper Rifle will now do 400 default damage on body shot. Head shot crit modifier was increased to compensate.
        The Assault Rifle and Suppressor Rifle bullet speed has been increased by 66%.
        Reduced the camera shake associated with being hit by the Assault plasma cannon. Also decreased the radius of when camera shake would be applied.
        Changed the Carbonite Casing costs of modules.
            This was patched live last week.
        Geology scans will now appear on the world map for your entire squad.
        Sped up inventory updates so that you don't load the entire inventory every time you pick up an item.


    UI Changes

        Chat now has global key bindings for chat scrolling that are in the keybindings, this allows for chat scrolling even when not in chat input mode.
            pgup - scroll up 3 lines
            pgdown - scroll down 3 lines
            alt+pgup - scroll to top
            alt+pgdown - scroll to bottom
            Rebinding these keys to normal letter keys will prevent them from working in chat input mode.
            If a new message comes in and you not in chat input mode, then the chat window will now auto scroll to the bottom.
        Added an interface option for changing the font type between an handful of our font types
        Increased font size from point 9 to point 10
        Relabeled option 'Background Transparency' to 'Background Opacity' as it better describes its functional orientation. Ie100% is fully Opaque
        Reversed the gradient on the hold-to-interact UI: increases the contrast of the bar's depletion.

1371650066.0	1gnkxx	[Rant] When I die, it's usually because of lag. In a game with permanent item loss and durability, this is unacceptable.	BrainKatana	27	14	41	"I doubt it's network lag on my end, as I have a phat pipe and when I play I'm the only person using it. I doubt it has anything to do with my machine (it's a beast).

It comes in the form of huge hitches that usually happen after I jump off of something high. This renders me incapable of softening my landing, so I splat. It also happens when I'm blazing down a trail at 100 KPH on my Locust Chopper.  Suddenly, I'm in deep water and dead. It also happens when I try to engage a large group of chosen who have say, taken over Trans-Hub. When I come back from the hitch, I'm ash because 30 of them shot me with a plasma cannon simultaneously. Plasma that I could have avoided had the lag spike not occurred.

This is the only game I have played where this has occurred for me. This is also a relatively recent issue. I've been in the beta for many months at this point. I know it's ""in beta."" In less than a month, it will be in ""Open Beta,"" which for many gamers (unfortunately) is just as good as a full release.

I worry about the overall reception of the game once it's freely accessible. I worry about the network performance of the game once anyone can play (assuming they even **can,** given the issues like this).

This is a unique game with practically unprecedented freedom of movement, large-scale open-world combat with fun mechanics, and the best damn mining minigame I have ever seen. I *want* it to succeed.

1375976478.0	1jylwm	[feedback] My first week in Firefall	alexformosoc	16	4	20	"Hello! I just completed my first week playing, and I though I could write down a bit of feedback to give my opinion as the devs seem to really dig this subreddit. 

First, the game looks absolutely amazing, gorgeous scenario, really good map design with bugs here and there where a player could get stuck and the only way to unstuck is to relog and lost all you were doing. Fortunately this bugs just happened to me twice in a one week period witch I find really good imho, also I was exploring and jumping everywhere and whatnot. 
Not im going to talk about specific points of the game:

1) About the crafting: I really love this system. Its easy to learn but hard to master. I think it needs to emphasize more on what is a mineral and what is gas etc, and needs more ""here, nothing of this is useful unless you refine it"" but its good, thankfully the people in the chat is almost always willing to teach. 

2) About the Battleframes: Really good system, I think 10 pilot points are a bit too much to unlock a ""premium"" Battleframe but its ok tho. I think the accord battleframes need a bit more of power, I played with the Recon and it really felt like everything was hitting harder than me, specially in PvP. Loved the horizontal progression and the unlocks. But I still think the game needs to give more feedback to the player about the diference of ""Assault Rifle"" and ""Assault Rifle I""...

3) About the ARES missions:  I liked them but got bored of them soon, its like 9238 guys standing in a hallway expecting to get killed. the AI in the game isn't very smart, but sometimes it feels like they are ""balanced' by giving them Aimbot-Power. Specially the Snipers that tear off more than half HP with 1 shot, something almost impossible for a human player unless you have less than 80 ping. 

4) About the Events, like Invasions and Tornados: For me, this is the cream of the crop of the game. I could be hoping around the entire map looking for Watchtowers and cities under siege defending them and recapturing them. Its really fun and where random people just teamup to help gives a good felling. Invasions are awesome, but I think the smaller events, like Tornados and Warbringers alone, need more rewards (See next topic)

5) Thumping: The good stuff, an incredible refreshing and fun mechanic, with just one thing to complain. Most of the time, at least in my week playing, people don't give a damn about a captured watchtower or city, because ""Thumping for rare resources is more important"", textual from the zone chat, and I got that answer 7 times. This is an attitude found specially more on high-level advanced players. They don't care about a watchtower, the only they care for are invasions because it gives a hefty amount of exp, but the rest is simple  ""not as important as thumping for rare mats"". In my opinion you should check the loot tables for missions and reclaim events in a way that, we who like to be defending cities and watchtowers and the ones that like to thump nonstop, get similar access to rare mats, or at least, make our effort worthwhile. 

6) About the general exploration: Its really good to just, walk here and there exploring, but besides the achievement of getting to the top-most part of the huge mountain (cant recall the name), I haven't found anything else. This game needs more exploration events, like challenges that involve escalating mountains, crossing lakes, or even a huge boss. Like the ones that appear at the end of the big thumpers, but just standing there, chilling, and that one can kill him and get some sort of achievement or mission. Your already have one similar, its the mission to kill the White Wolf (or something), im just saying to make MORE of those kind of missions. 

7) About the tutorial: Its divided by 2 segments, inside the huge lab where you can test the battleframes, its good, really good, except for the non-funny robot which I was expecting to be funny for the ""he has a straaaannngeeee AI"" part. When you leave the Lab, and get introduced to crafting, battleframe upgrading etc, that part is simply awful, I was getting lost and asking in the zone chat instead of doing the tutorial because it was 0 interesting. Also, im stuck in a mission (Echoes from Sertao) where I need a gazillion vouchers to buy something to do something that I don't care because you gave a new player a quest to collet a gazillion vouchers (FARMING) and that's terrible. 

8) General: I don't think I can write anything else, because I haven't really tried the PvP in more than 2-3 matches to get an exp-boost. The controls are really good, the performance is acceptably good, menus are ok, not awesome, but ok. I think its a really good job the fact that you accept ui-mods even in this early stages of the Open Beta. The night-day cycle has the strange feeling that the nights are actually longer than days, and they are stupidly dark, to the point where gameplay becomes damaged by the fact that you cant see ANYTHING unless you buy flares because the flashlight sucks. 

I really hope this feedback is good for something, and I hope I can get some thoughts on my perspective, coming from a new player I expect other players tell me if im wrong in something coming from my ignorance on many facts of the game. 

Thanks

* Q1) *Do I need to have 10,000 of Raw or Refined resources?*
* A1) **It must be 10,000 REFINED resources, not raw.** keep in mind purity affects refining on a linear scale, at 0 purity you get 50% refined from raw, at 1000 purity you get 100% refined from raw, and it's a liner scale in-between.

* Q2) *Does the 10,000 refined resources need be all of the same Quality? (I.E. Q ^ 201)*
* A2) **NO!**  You can combined the 10,000 resources from ANY QUALITY rating, as long as it's the required resource (i.e. electroactive polymers for electron frame)

* Q3) *If I am using the 10,000 refined resources to meet the requirement, and I'm using multiple kinds of resources, how is the 10,000 resource requirement split between the various resource qualities I have in inventory?*

* A3) **When you have the 10,000+ necesarry refined resources, and you click the green frame square under the line you want to progress (MASS, POWER, CPU CORES) you will be presented with a popup...  *DON'T JUST CLICK CONFIRM!  PLEASE BE AWARE* you can click on the resource box &amp; you will be presented with a list of the qualifying resources, and slider bars to determine how much of each quality you want to put in to combine to meet the 10,000 resource requirement.  I believe by default (at least in my case) it will always try to use the highest amount of lower quality resources before moving on to higher quality, to avoid using your best resources first, but this isn't fully confirmed so please be safe and click the resource box and make sure your using the 10,000+ of what you really want to burn up (for example, small piles of less than 75 resources that aren't good for any crafting recipes, may want to burn them up first)**

* Q4) *Does it actually use the 10,000 resources?*
* A4) **YES, IT DOES.**  this is part of the story, the story is the reason you need those 10,000+ refined resources, is to actually progress the frame to new heights via new materials. "	t5_2s629	True
1364432880.0	1b5d0n	Making Thumping More Interesting: Suggestion	TimmyToldYou	15	2	16	"Right now thumping is sort of boring. It's stressful, sure, and when I get to 20% integrity with 85% capacity I have a heart pounding minute, but it's not really interesting. I know what's going to come, I know how I'm going to deal with it, I just repeat the process until the percentage gets to 100, and start again. What comes at the end of thumping, the resources, are fun, but the whole point is to make the journey fun too. So in that spirit I thought ""how can I not change the core concept of thumping, fighting off the monsters, while still making it interesting."" I spent a few days refining my idea, and I think I have something easy to put in place and really awesome.

Make wave ""types.""

Since I know (from earlier discussions of how thump spawns work) that each monster is assigned, essentially, a ""difficulty level,"" that is put into an equation to figure out what spawns for a thumper, the waves should be able to be kept balanced while still being interesting.

Examples: 

Big Baddie Wave, spawns a certain number (1-5 depending on difficulty) of those large, bossish enemies, i.e Megali or Terrorclaws. Possibly they have support sometimes, like a swarm of aranha or argonauts, but the main focus is on the big bad guy(s).

Flying Swarm: As the name implies, spawns a swarm of whatever flying enemy is appropriate. 

Artillery Support: Area appropriate long range tanky enemies (siegers, spitters) supported by lots of swarming, small melee enemies. 

OH NOES: Explosive Aranha supported by tanky-melee enemies, i.e Nautili or Whiptail threshers.

etc,etc


The point being that any one wave could spawn at any time, and its severity could be based on the severity of the wave's current spawn amounts (The 75% rush would be a tense moment, those who hate/love certain waves would be praying for/scared of a certain one) 

You could even mix the waves to keep it interesting, as in a half flyer half big baddie wave for a megalus supported by tidal scavengers (forgotten their new name), the point being to never dilute them enough to lose the ability to recognize whats happening and turn it, again, into a semi-random swarm fest.

I think a system like this would make thumping a constantly fun, tense environment, while still allowing for short breaks between waves. 

TL;DR
Add a wave ""type"" or ""theme"" system to thumping that makes certain random waves spawn certain things, i.e a Flyer wave or a Big Boss wave, because right now it's constantly the same random set, and is therefore repetitive and boring.

Thoughts?

Kryyss	18	4	7	"Thanks to the help of more volunteers joining our team recently, we have now completed listings for all Battleframes in our [Nanoprint database](http://rawr4firefall.com). You will find all currently printable weapons, modules and abilities for each frame on the corresponding pages, and we will of course update them as new nanoprints become available ingame.

We also upgraded the way the best materials to be used for crafting certain attributes are calculated. Instead of members of the RAWRsome team manually recalculating results every time the resources shift, you will now instantly get updated tables every time we put new isotopes up in the Live resource feed. Of course we still might not now immediately when new resources appear ingame, so if you notice it before we do, we would very much appreciate it if you posted a screenshot of the new hybrid with it's attributes [in our forums!](http://www.rawr4firefall.com/?q=forum)"	t5_2s629	True
1359385360.0	17fify	Founders worth it?	Omneya22	13	2	30	"Like many others, This beta weekend was my first chance to get my hands on the game. Good times were to be had by all. I see a lot of promise for the game. In game community was super laid back and really helpful.

My question to you reddit is... Is the mid tier founders pack worth it?

1. Will these items/perks carry over into live after the beta ends and it launches?

2. Lt. VS Ensign

Either pack would get me access to the game throughout the rest of the beta monday through friday week after week, (At least this is my understanding.) an xp boost, and some red beans.

The mid tier says it has some ensign level masks for friends... Is anyone able to confirm if this grants the bonuses of the ensign tier to those friends as well(such as permanent access with me)? Or do they just get to wear the mask?

So far, I've been disappointed. The range of gliders is very limited, and you end up sprinting most of the distance anyway. The only gliders that I've found remotely useful were the ones that are very high and time-consuming to reach. In that time you could just be running to your destination.

But those aside, what else is there to do?  I understand I'm supposed to explore and use the thumper to gather materials.  I also found a few of the local events that you stumble upon.

But other than that, why is the world map so large?  There's only about 1 hour worth of questing content, so is all that extra space for the ""random"" events and thumping areas?  I don't understand, it confuses me.  It seems like a lot of wasted area.

This was something brought up at [F:COM (FFANZ Meeting)](http://ffanz.com/threads/ffanz-player-meeting.302/) last saturday and I didn't have time to write it up till now. The general problem at the moment with Chosen Invasions is general Latency and Difficulty of the event. In it's current status, players will swarm to a shard with an invasion in order to get the reward or it will get ignored but usually nothing between. When this happens, there are generally a Ton of latency issues as swarms of mobs spawn and many players (some playing on servers across the sea) have difficulties with smooth gameplay. Difficulty is a joke most times due to the number of players on the event. Even normally I have been able to solo a warbringer with a T3 geared char. What I propose is a two-part solution to these issues:

First: Change the enemy drop table of the Warbringers (aka better mobs not more mobs). Change the spawn table to include Siegbreakers or even Juggernaut Elites. These bring the quality of enemies up and you can reduce the amount that spawn. At the same time, this brings more variance to the enemies that come into play. You can also have Warbringer1 drop normal enemies and Warbringer2 drop 'advanced' enemies so that players can choose which battles to assist on. This would still reduce the amount of enemies being spawned and help improve latency. One last detail on this is to take out the darn melding summoning things. Those zombies (blanking on the real name) don't add to the fights at all in this case. They really just clutter the area up and get AOE'd down. Taking all the more resources on the shard that could go to improving performance.

Second: Currently (besides the 2 minute ship spawner) enemies spawn at a rate of once a minute. This is a perfect opportunity to include a Population Check within the Event. Run a check for how many players are in the area for the next spawn cycle. Depending on the number of players, increase the difficulty level of the enemies that get spawned. I mean this as in the Yellow/Orange/Purple/Red difficulty not as in more enemies. This would make a better challenge for players without having to keep throwing out more mobs into the mix. Even a swarm of new players in Stock gear could handle a few Reds if there were enough of them. As far as a balance check, I think you should assume that all players involved are in T2 gear (or maybee T1.5 for the math?) and adjust the difficulty levels per X players based on that.

TL : DR - Spawn Better and Less Mobs + Change color difficulty based on number of players. "	t5_2s629	True

1368065919.0	1dz4u8	Some (relatively) concise thoughts on durability.	BrainKatana	14	3	36	"* Games with economies need some form of entropy, otherwise inflation will occur. Some sort of ""sink"" for in game currency is necessary.

* Durability provides that sink rather handily.

* The current implementation punishes you for simply playing the game, especially if we assume that higher-tier gear will be more costly to repair.

* The current implementation requires constant monitoring by players: every visit to a Battleframe Garage has just become a trip to the repair station to make sure you're in tip top condition. This is a non-fun maintenance loop.

* There are other games with durability systems that execute them in better, more opaque ways, such as only taking durability ""damage"" on player death. This creates a clear correlation between item durability (and thus maintenance).

* Basic Army system coming!

* Battleframes no longer in tiers. Its now 15 frames, 3 of each archetype, unlocked separately, leveled up separately.

* Garage slots changed, when you buy a Battleframe, you get a garage slot for that frame, one each for PVE and PVP. People who bought garage slots prior, get red bean refunds.

* Removed load-outs, so single PVP, and single PVE slot (single ability set) for now.

* You can now buy frames with red beans OR ""tokens"". Earn tokens through progression through frames, if you spend XP on frames you get tokens. For now they are only used for purchasing Battleframes.

* Ultimate abilities, deal damage/ heal others/ take damage to build up for the ultimate, slowly decays over time. CAN USE in PVP.

* New starting area ""Battle Lab"" for basic movement and shooting etc. Start in ""civilian battleframe"" you get to choose one of the archetypes, and there are unique tutorials for each ability on each frame. Future testing ground for new frames/guns etc that are to be released. By the sounds of it, on the upcoming patch you can't go BACK once its over.

1349983892.0	11bpk1	What do you guys do to keep things fresh?	OwlG5	13	2	13	"My main issue with Firefall is that I find myself doing the same things over and over. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, since I do that in a lot of games. However, I find that there usually comes a point after each patch where I can't find anything I want to do. PvP queues have slowed down to a crawl, and generally the people I encounter there are extremely mean-spirited, so I've generally not been doing that unless I can do one of the more team-based game modes like Sabotage. Otherwise, there's Thumping, Chosen hunting and exploring, but all of those can only last so long, especially seeing as how I generally encounter less people who want to group up and go do things nowadays.

So, what do you guys do to keep things interesting? I've been going the route of taking longer breaks from Firefall and returning when a patch hits, but I *want* to play the game.

I should say I've already gone and decided to try a completely new frame, which has been working out, but I'm out of frame slots now, so I don't know that'll be an option for awhile."	t5_2s629	True

Well, a lot of support. I've never shoutcasted before. I've never made a Let's Play before. I'm never produced my own content before. Hell, I've never played Firefall before, except for a few minutes on a laggy laptop while I got destroyed by bug things that popped out of the ground. I am a content consumer, spending my my time playing and watching League of Legends. Because of this, I have a lot of questions.

Once I get my new desktop in, I'm going to be making a Let's Play about Firefall to try to get my name out there.

Are PvP tournaments in Firefall normal to see? Are they possible for the average player to hold? If possible, I want to hold my own PvP tournaments in the future with real-money prizes from my own wallet, as practice for shoutcasting and as a way to spread my name.

Is this allowed? And if it is allowed, would you join for a $50 prize? How about $100?

Thanks in advance for answering my questions. I'll be posting this to the Firefall forums as well after I get my basic, ""Is this possible?"" and ""Is this allowed?"" questions answered.

I mean no disrespect to Firefall in any way about this, I understand it's just beta but I'm wondering what to expect and to see if this is a game for me or not, because I love the graphics, combat, jet packs (oh god the jetpacks!) but I don't particularly enjoy grinding in pve only to play in pvp.

I played Global Agenda and in the end I was really dissapointed because it got boring quickly - you only had a small pve zone with a dozen of quests, and that's it.

If you had, then you might have noticed a glorious shard that was 100% taken by the chosen apart from copa.  This provided me with two things.  One, I had some of the most intense fun with my army/squadmates I can remember, because the sheer amount of chaos on the map meant that almost every inch of ground we retook was getting eyeballed by the chosen almost immediately, and it was hard to make any progress until more people logged on.  Two, I thought it might be fun to have this happen more often.  Perhaps a PvE que that we could hop in similar to PvP, but the shard you hop to is in a sort of ""hardmode"" with the chosen constantly attacking, providing a very intense invasion experience.  Perhaps a goal for that shard would be to clear the chosen out of the invaded areas, or perhaps the chosen begin invading and get progressively more and more powerful and in greater numbers until all towns are overrun.

1365976300.0	1cckkm	Looking to try Firefall (newb questions inside)	Isntprepared	11	2	14	"In other MMO games, I am somewhat of an alt-aholic.  When I played Tribes (the original, not the current F2P shooter),  I played multiple roles, and enjoyed swapping suits / loadouts on the fly to adapt to what the team needed.   Usually roles were  somewhat fixed, but players on the team were expected to have multiple skillsets and not be a 1-trick pony.

Those being said:

1)  How viable is it to play multiple styles with multiple frames?  

2)  I know it is *possible* to kit out multiple frames, but is it desirable to do so?   

3) Are those that pick a frame and keep to it at a huge advantage over those that choose to diversify?  

4) What are the advantages (if any) to diversification?  

5) Is it viable to swap frames as needed for tactical reasons, similar to tribes?   Or is it more like other MMO's where you'd log out of your current toon and log back in as your alt?  (I know mechanically you just visit a station, but for example: if the stations are FAR between or have a cooldown, it would effectively preclude quick swapping for tactical gain)

6) Are the different frames SO different in playstyle that swapping might lower your effective skill level with each frame that it becomes an inherent advantage to practice only one playstyle?

7) Are the frames similar enough in playstyle that there is effectively little reward to choosing to specialize?  (opposite of question 6 -- this is a balance that might be hard to get right!)

8) How difficult is it to level multiple frames to a satisfactory standard?  For me at least, satisfactory standard would mean being able to participate in whatever the equivalent to ""end-game"" content is for Firefall (if there exists  such content yet, or ever).

Thanks  in advance!

IMO, many of the T2 frames have lackluster abilities, either in performance, presentation, or both. While I understand that this is about as ""true"" of a game beta as you can get these days, it doesn't change the fact that I want to have a good time while I'm playing the not-done version of FireFall. In light of this, I have optimized my Firecat to suit my dive-bombing, burninating, up-close-and-personal playstyle. Even if you have crummy minerals, **CRAFT EVERYTHING.** It's better than the stock version with very few exceptions (AFAICT those exceptions seem to be bugs...).

**Plating:** Accord I (high end crafted versions give great regen)

**Passive:** Incinerator

**Ability 1**: Crater

**Ability 2**: Overcharge

**Ability 3**: Immolate

**HKM**: Shockwave

**Primary:** Thermal Cannon

**Secondary:** Shotgun

**TIPS**

* Incinerator affects all frame abilities as well as the Thermal Cannon's alt fire. This means that your Crater and HKM Shockwave will ignite enemies.

* For some reason (**DEFINITELY** a bug), ~~Overcharge's cooldown is directly proportional to the quality of mineral you use to craft it. If you use a low QL mineral, the cooldown will be shorter.~~ *Crafting Overcharge seems to be bugged, as I just created two wildly different quality versions of Overcharge I, and they have exactly the same stats as one another, while they are 1% different in power from the Stock variant, with roughly a 25% higher cooldown. Stick with Stock Overcharge for now.*

* With a short-cooldown Overcharge, pop it as often as you can, especially before dropping a crater or a shockwave.

* Use the Thermal Cannon on your way into a fight (from the air), pop Overcharge, use Crater to ""arrive"" (heh), swap to your shotgun, hit immolate, then go to work. When Immolate is out, take off and begin bombardment with the Thermal Cannon again.

It's pretty straightforward, and it's lacking any real ranged option, but the only real drawback I've seen is that Chosen Drones can be hard to kill at range unless I get a direct hit with the Thermal Cannon. I'm getting pretty good at that, though!"	t5_2s629	True

1355339210.0	14qm0h	Weekend Beta Tester First Impressions	opinionated_player	10	1	17	"**Warning!  Incoming Wall of Text!**


Overall, I'm fairly impressed.  My weekend experience convinced me to buy a Founder's Package.


But I thought I'd write up my first impressions, while I'm still ""fresh"" to the game.  I'm going to be fairly critical here, but don't take that too hard...I wouldn't have bought in with a Founder's Package if my overall view was negative, after all!  And I'll also try to describe the things I like a lot too.


**Game Introduction**


After logging in (and accidentally skipping the Introduction Tab), I'm immediately presented with class (BattleFrame) choice.  Unfortunately, (and I'll talk more about this later), BattleFrame information is very hard to come by in this game.  Though, in some ways it doesn't matter
(new tier 1 BattleFrames are cheap), I didn't feel like I was given
enough information about each type of frame to make an informed
decision to start with, adding to a feeling of disorientation to start
with...


I think the game would benefit greatly from a introductory
training/battleframe-testing area/room.  Because, after (somewhat
blindly) choosing an initial frame, my immediate concerns shifted to
learning the game's interface:  how to move and shoot, at a minimum.
And while the introduction does sort of cover this, it's a bit too
busy.... 


I liked the dropship introduction to the open world.  However, upon
landing, things get very busy, fast.  Probably too busy, too fast.
Aero and Oilspill are yammering at you, world notifications are
popping up.  Tutorial pop-ups are popping, and I've only got the most
basic idea of how to move and shoot.  (And even that is heavily supplemented by
experience with other games I've played in the past.)  Meanwhile,
players are chatting away in a chat interface I haven't learned yet.
(Although, again, I'm helped quite a bit by previous experience in
other games.)  All in all, too many things were competing for my total
newbie attention at once. 


So, that brings us to the quests...


**Quest System**


I get the feeling that (World Notifications, i.e. side-quests, aside)
the quest system is mostly just for introductory/tutorial purposes.
Which is just fine by me.  I'm far more interested in open-world PvE,
with dynamic events, than playing endless fetch-it, in general.  But there are
some issues there.  The most annoying of which was the locations being
bugged.  ""Finding Tiki"" was particularly problemetic, in that 3
objectives (one line item, 0/3) were not indicated with objective
markers, at all! And later on, the Thump Dump SIN Uplink objective
indicator is on a dropship, rather than the actual objective ~100
meters from the indicator (I finally found this on my 4th
attempt...after giving up and doing side-quests/exploration, between
my previous 3 attempts.)  This was highly annoying.


More generally, distant location markers (objectives and waypoints)
are sometimes hard to locate, by just spinning around.  If you're not
close enough to them for them to be displayed on your mini-map, it can
be hard to determine which direction to move in.  They really should
be more, rather than less, visible when you are far away.  (When you
are close, your mini-map is more than adequate.)


Also, from the Thump Dump bounty board, I've had bounties spawn inside of terrain (assuming the location indicator is correct).  This is also frustrating.


However, I assume these are all known bugs that will be fixed, before
beta ends.


**Other questing gripes**


I tried and failed to do racing quests, twice.  But I tried on foot,
which in hindsight, was probably not what was intended.  On race attempt 1 (from a terminal, ""hey a terminal! What is it for?""), I hadn't talked to Terromoto, and so didn't even have an LGV in my inventory.  My second attempt, I talked to him, and he
supplied an LGV, mentioned a race, and left me puzzled:  I had no idea
where the race started.  I then went to a race terminal, but again, I missed the cues, and thought race 2
(like my first attempt) was a foot/jump-pack race, and a separate,
different, side-quest from the one handed out by Terromoto.  In
hindsight, suspect I'm supposed to get the LGV from him, then use the
terminals to start a race. However, if that was communicated to me, I
either missed it, or failed to understand.  I don't think I'm an idiot
(though few idiots do), so I think the race mechanics need to be much
better communicated to players.


I didn't understand the antenna side-quest at all.  And still don't.
Much, much, better communication is needed there.


Same goes for the Holmer Security side-quest.  No idea of where to go,
or what to do.


I had no issues with the Crashed LGV or Crashed Thumper
side-quests. (Well, other than these occasionally spawning inside
terrain, that is.  But I've already mentioned that.)


**PvE Combat**


This was great!  Controls are intuitive, and combat is fun and
challenging.  Finding an appropriate level of challenge is as simple
as finding the appropriate enemies to engage (or run away from).  I
enjoyed the open-world PvE so much, that's where I spent the vast
majority of my time.


But that's all I'm going to say here, since most of the rest of this
deals with the open world.   Except for...


**PvP Combat**

I only did 5 matches, so my comments here will be brief.  It was fun,
and seemed balanced.  I was a little disappointed at map size; the PvP
playing field does feel like a slightly too-small sandbox.  But for
5v5, maybe it has to be that way.  But it played very smoothly, and
otherwise provided everything I'd expect from a good PvP match.


I am a little put off by the Execute mechanic.  Both viscerally (I
guess I'm a bit of a prude, but it does seem needlessly graphic), and
tactically (when do I execute, for best advantage for my team?).


It would seem (and please be forgiving to my complete newbie analysis,
here), that *not* executing is almost always tactically superior...not
only are you creating a revival ambush honeypot, by just leaving an
opponent downed, but you are also adding the maximum delay to their
re-spawn time.  That is, not executing gives your team a numerical
advantage in every respect, aside from the tiny delay in a point for
your team.


It's an interesting mechanic.  So interesting that I'm not
exactly sure how I feel about it, just yet.


Anyway, that's all I have to say about PvP, here.  Moving along to other game aspects...

**Gliding**


This was hard to figure out at first.  And I still don't know how to
spot, or effectively use updrafts.  I did the initial gliding quest at
night, and failed spectacularly.  This was the one training quest I
wish I had the ability to reset, and try again.  But, I finally worked
out holding the spacebar, and control, and maintaining airspeed.
Though, I'm still working on graceful landing, and firing weapons
while gliding.

But gliding is what really sold the Founder's Pack for me.  Being able
to gracefully sail over this beautiful open world is a new and highly
desirable experience.  Other than the previously mentioned difficulty
in identifying updraft locations, my only ""gripe"" about gliding is the
requirement of a glide-pad to trigger it.


I look forward to my many glide jumps to come!


**BattleFrame Progression**

This is the part of the game that needs the most work.  And it's
mostly UI work!  The basic concepts are good, maybe even great, but
messaging them to the player is atrocious.


Why, oh why, is the BattleFrame garage separate from the BattleFrame
selection station?  I'll agree (strongly) that the Garage is already a
cluttered mess, but having a separate station with only a ""select
frame"" function just seems dumb.   There are (at least) 4 discrete
battleframe tasks players engage in:  Frame Selection, Tech Tree
License Unlocks, Individual Frame Loadout, and Warpaint.  Putting the
least complicated of these in a separate station makes little sense.
They either should all be combined into one station, or all separated
into individual stations.  Though possibly Licensing and Loadout
should be combined because of their closer relationship, the others
are really quite separate tasks.

I imagine the frame-selection separation is done for end-game player
benefit, as long-time players will have (mostly) settled on loadout
and warpaint, after having unlocked all licenses for the frames they
use, leaving frame selection as their one remaining common battleframe task.  But that seems like inverted UX design to me.  It's the newbie experience that needs streamlining, not the expert player's!

It doesn't help that I didn't much care for any of the garage UIs.
They were all usable, but initially confusing, and even after
understanding was achieved, they still felt awkward and sluggish, to
navigate around in.  I'm hopeful that this is just beta vetting (the
simplest thing that works), and they'll be cleaned up and polished
before the initial public release.

And the only part of this game I hated was the tech tree.  And please
note that I'm only describing my experience in tier 1...I still have
all sorts of fear, uncertainty, and doubt about tier 2.  

There didn't seem to be any rhyme, reason, or rationale behind the
paths through the tech tree.  While, arguably, stronger components
were available more to the right hand side, there didn't seem to be
any other organization at play.  Additional weapons, upgraded
components, and new abilities just seemed randomly scattered
throughout the tree. 

And it gets worse!  You can't compare upgrades, except to what you
already have equipped. (Which for a new player, is often nothing!)
For example, the Dreadnaught frame doesn't start with a shotgun, so
there's no way to compare the 2 (or 3?) shotguns in the tech tree to
each other, without writing down stats, outside of the game. (Which is
pretty inconvenient...especially since there *is* support for 2 item
comparisons built into the game!)  So, you can't even (easily) choose
your path based on which upgrades you (think you might) want.  (In the
example provided, this would be the ""best"" shotgun path.)

And it gets worse from there.  I still know absolutely nothing about
tier 2, and yet, my already thoroughly confusing tier 1 choices
determine which which tier 2 track I'm on.  I'm not just
choosing my next minor upgrade, I'm locking in a decision that will
probably take another 5-10 hours of play to reverse.  

(I do get that,
eventually, I'll probably just unlock *everything*, at least for the
frames I prefer...but I'm focusing on a new player's experience here.)


This is especially cruel to a newbie.  The paths through the tree seem
utterly meaningless, except for the next tier, which you can't look at
while studying the path you are currently on.  So, starting from a
position of confused ignorance, the tech tree seems purposefully
designed to keep you there.  There were definitely components in the
tree I worked toward, but I could never shake the nagging doubt that
the path I am taking was perhaps leading me away from where I wanted to be going in the long(er) term. 

Anyway, I don't want to ding the upgrades or that there's an
experienced based progression.  But the form and organization of the
tech tree was easily the most disappointing aspect of my weekend play
experience.  Which was, various minor glitches aside, overwhelmingly
positive.

**I like it!**

PvP was (map size aside) everything I hoped it would be, and more!


The open-world PvE dynamic events kept me busy, and on my toes, as I explored.  The open-world is large and pretty.  There's lots to explore and experience.  And its mechanics hint of a great deal of flexiblity for adding new content and events.  I had a great time.

See you in-game!

1353212611.0	13dv9e	Firefall Talent Tree page? (request/idea)	zVulture	11	1	10	"I think that a talent tree page out of the game would be great for new players trying to get into Firefall.  While this is 'common' for a lot of MMO's, Firefall's Loadout system makes this a bit more difficult to do.  For now I think it could be implemented in stages (as it's still in Beta).  While the first stage shouldn't be that difficult and might be fine just by itself, the others are just optional to make things better and better.

Stage 1:  Just the basic Tree's for the classes with current descriptions of all the abilities. Try and use the same GUI system as in-game to make it easy to navigate (or at least a similar layout).

Stage 2: Add video's tied to each Base ability, weapon and (Optional) module.  Any branded ones will just link back to the basic videos.

Stage 3: Add in a Battleframe Loadout.  For T2 crafted items, assume Blue quality (500?) material was used to make it.  Make 'finished loadouts' sharable.

Stage 4: Add in a custom module loadout that either pulls actual items stats of items your character owns or allows users to 'make' the module (manually setting the material/rarity?).

I know I am probably getting ahead of myself as Dev people are concentrated on improving/expanding the game.  But I think this would help out enormously to the game's attraction for both prospective, new and current players.

1337742770.0	u0f72	Group thumping buff, Additional Thumper Events and more...

Re-posting it here as a few people are probably like me and don't read the forums but hang out here.  I tried to avoid changes planned in the Dev update recently, but here are a couple ideas to improve the Open World:


**Crystite, patterns and thumping:**

Currently, the system penalizes players for grouping up to do thumps. With the high crystite cost of patterns after level 12, it makes it almost a requirement to be greedy as heck about thumping. I can farm out at least 5 spots so far as a solo engineer to make more/quicker than a group thumping could. I do not request that these locations be taken away (well maybe 2 that still use height/cliff protection), but instead that group thumping be encouraged. This could be accomplished in a few different ways, one being a 'buff' or 'bonus' to minerals gained while in a group. To keep it balanced, this bonus should not be above the amount a solo person could farm from a node. Rewarding those who adventure out alone or in smaller groups while still giving incentive for grouping with others.

**Thumping Events/Geography:**

I think one of the wonderful things about firefall is the world around us. At the moment, Thumping on high ground isn't allowed because bugs can't get up to you. I think this is an issue with game mechanics, not about where you drop the thumper. I am not sure the difficulty of detection, but I believe a 'high location' should just have a separate thumper event cycle than ones on the low ground. The event would include more flying enemies, jumping and tunneling enemies (detailed below) that would make it a challenge to thump there. Possibly you need to use a different kind of thumper for these?

**Possible Enemies for High elevation thump:**

Small Mosquito: Take the fire rate down a bit on these guys (so they arn't machine guns like the normal sized ones) and these would make it great as a 'swarm' mob mechanic.

Explosive Mosquito: These mobs have sucked the power from an Explosive Aranha. It has slowed them down but they are still deadly if not stopped.

Normal Mosquito: Same, keep them the machine gun bad asses they are.

Giant Mosquito (I forget the real name): Those big ones that pop out from the pools on one of the quests.

Terror Mosquito?: Some challenging flying enemy that has multiple abilities like the terror claws

Small and Normal Threshers: They dig so they can still get to the high ground. Make people look at their feet and not just the air.

Decreased the Medic's Vamp Beam alt-fire to self-heal at the same rate as the Overheal alt-fire.

Increased the healing rate on the Engineer deployable Repair Station II. Removed the energy restoration.

Supercharge will no longer make super men out of players. Your energy will now deplete after supercharge wears off.

Changed the ""Resources Must Flow"" mission to only require 400 coralite.

Players in a downed state now have less hitpoints and are more easily killed by gun fire and abilities.
More graphical performance improvements.

You can now unqueue from PvP by hitting the L key by default.

Added a hotkey to the PvP queue window. You can use K to open the queue window.

You can now open the player screen (default P key) when in a downed state.

Added UI Feedback for invalid scan hammer results: Thumping prohibited, Thumper nearby, Invalid Surface, and No Significant Resources.

Squadmate resource scan reports look different from your own when appearing on the HUD.

Chat is now disabled while flying in on the dropship during the opening sequence.




**Bug Fixes**

Fixed uncommon weapon energy modules to actually give 15% weapon energy. Previously they were giving only 5%.

Fixed an issue where silicate deposits would sometimes not return any resources on the ""Tough Nut to Crack"" mission.

Fixed multiple instances of props not having collision around Trans Hub.

Fixed a few holes allowing you to get inside the Trans Hub hangar bay.

Fixed issues where you would not see the proper online state of people on your friends list.

Fixed a bug where squad cancellation did not work properly with random queuing.

Fix for randomly appearing/disappearing UI.

Fixed multiple issues where the ammo count on the gun would not match the ammo count on the UI.

Fix for entering AA turrets and reload prompt remaining displayed.

Fixed an issue where players would not always appear in SIN.

Really fixed the ability to stack healback and splash modules.

Fixed issues with hissers unburrowing in mid-air.

Even more fixes to the AI servers to prevent degredation over time.

I also feel the jumpjets don't need to be so loud, but that is somewhat less of a problem.

The options menu does not have separate settings specific to your personal sound effect volume level and it does not appear this is an issue with my specific setup (determined from watching videos of firefall gameplay and no other games I play have specific overpowering sound effects).

I didnt get far in to the crafting and battleframes but I think that I have a general idea about how it all works but I have a few questions.
Since crafting is the only way of getting gear I realy wonder why they made it so complicated. I went through the ingame tutorial and I crafted a few stuff on my own but I still dont understand what I'm suposed to do with the minerals and metal I get from ""thumping""
But again I'm maybe just stupid for that stuff and other people dont have any problems with crafting.

Second question/observation is that these so called ""Chosen Ones"" are not properly explained but I dont have any problems with that.
They are the bad guys, the enemy and we are suposed to shoot them.
If I undrrstood corectly they show up at random outposts and attack in waves that get bigger and stronger every time.
What I dont understand is will they atack every outpost no matter how small it is, how often do they do it and what can we do to fortify a outpost.

But regardless of all these things the game is still a awesome experiance and the shooting feels thing and controled."	t5_2s629	True

1355142949.0	14lnxb	Thoughts of a blind purchase Founder after a very intense weekend of playing	Conot	10	1	17	"I'm going to illustrate my thoughts on the game so far, as I see quite a few people asking about the game while they're considering purchasing Founder.

I'll bold a TL;DR at the bottom of every point, but otherwise this is going to be pretty rantish.
 
 
 
 
**Classes/Battleframes**
 
I thought the amount of choice was nice, and being able to buy new frames for existing characters rather then being locked into one class for the whole life of my character was nice.

I decided to go Engineer because I love turrets and generally play very supportish, I found my solo ability fairly good, although it wasn't until I got to T2 that I found I could reliably go toe to toe with Chosen (Juggahnauts still mess me up in close quarters though, dear god). Was slightly annoyed that the Juggernauts attack can one shot my turrets, making it nigh useless to repair them.

Choice of abilities was alright, I found mines to be fairly useless due to a fairly long set up time and only being able to have one set down as a time. I found the description for branded abilities (Omnidyne, Kitsuon, etc.) kinda bland and uninformative, and it only got worse when I hit T2 and it was unclear what difference there was between Omnidyne Servos and Kitsuon Servos when I'm crafting them with materials.

I know this has been touched upon before, but I was rather disgusted with the state of female attire, especially the Engineer. Even the Juggernaut is dressed rather skimpily for someone who is meant to be a pseudo-walking tank. I've got no issue with showing skin but... you get the point.

**TL;DR** Choice of classes and customization ability wise is good, female attire could use work (IMO).
 
 
 
**PvE** 
 
I was slightly worried when I saw that the timeline for the game said that full PvE wasn't in yet, but there is definitely plenty to do at the moment, with more on the way.

There are, of course, Thumpers. The stock thumpers are fairly boring to do, I certainly found as a Engineer that I had no issue defending it and keeping my thumper above 90% integrity. The Advanced Thumpers were much harder (and to be fair, they do state that its meant to be 2-4 characters) My only complaint would be that the exploding aranhas feel far too common towards the later parts of the thumping, I've literally watched thumpers go from 50% to 15% from one bad exploding aranha chain. Even with a full group of 5 people with fairly good party diversity (1 T2 Assault, 1 T2 Engineer, 1 T1 Juggernaut, 1 T1 Bioengineer, 1 T1 Engineer) we were finding it difficult to spot and kill those Aranhas before they got into damaging range. It might help if they glowed more at night time, as the smoke trail is basically invisible at night, even with flares/flashlights.

Chosen Droppods and Incursions are fairly good XP and fun to play, although Incursions are VERY hard, even with organized groups going at them. Not much to add, although it seems as though its much easier to go around the chosen and ""backdoor"" their pod, then mop up after that, not sure what you can really do to help that other then put more chosen on drop pod guard.

Watchtower Defense/Reclaiming, Fairly fun. Obviously strategic value in the form of being able to respawn further/have access to glider platforms. They do need some sort of reward beyond killing Chosen, but its been stated by a Red5 that something is coming to help with that. Only real complaint would be that Juggernaughts are absolutely ridiculous when reclaiming, as its night impossible to dodge their shots at close quarters, and I've honestly seen 5 or 4 walk through the door at once. Not fun.

LGVs/Crashed Thumpers I didn't interact with much. It SEEMS to me that doing LGVs is giving me pieces to eventually make my own, but nothing has actually stated it.

Crashed Thumpers I barely touched, they were so numerous and very frequently were nearly finished by the time I arrived, which made it annoying to get shouted at by Oilspill to help him fix it up. Might want to put in a check that doesn't have the event get flagged for players if its already in progress, but thats just a suggestion.
 
 
 
**TL;DR** Good variety of things to do, Thumpers are good fun and get you plenty of minerals, towers could use rewards of some sort, LGVs/Crashed Thumpers don't feel worth doing as their reward is not well explained.

**[NerdGasm Warning, for TLDR skip this]** Firstly I have to admit that I am in complete and total love with this alt-fire weapon named so perfectly the ""Nova Cannon"". The game-play, visual, and audio come together so well its exactly what I would want to compliment the primary-fire of the gun. Making a charged shot that has increased damage, and more importantly incredible area of effect with knock-back, but is so brilliantly balanced by not only its slow moving velocity and the amount of time it takes to charge, but also the visual and audible daunting...ness of the slow-moving death ball is pure warning enough to get out of its way. And wow does the nova cannon look cool as the light reflects of rich geometry during nighttime.

----

**[Suggestion]** The only problem I have with the Nova cannon (other than the current bugs) is that while charging it does not properly visually or audibly represent the amount of shots put into the Nova Ball, leaving you not only guessing how many shots are in it, but also the ball stops growing in size on the gun half way through, and then when you launch it, it's instantly massive.

As a fix I propose:

1. Visually keep the nova ball growing until it is shot allowing it to link up with the projectile size
2. Also maybe progressively adding visual effects such as plasma forming the final projectile
3. Since Red5 needs to make money somewhere introduce coloring where it charges into a custom color that you have to buy with $$ making the gun more personal
4. Make the audio while charging get incrementally meaner deeper and angrier with each charge put into it, so players can hear and count the amount of charges.
5. When firing the fully charged Nova Cannon it should knock-back the shooter a small amount. This recoil creates an awesome feeling for the player and creates a higher feeling of reward if a shot is landed.

No longer is the alt-fire heal a pain to aim and a waste of ammo unless your target is holding still. Its become a multi-target blast of green goodness, with what seems to be a wider spread than the shotgun. The range is still 20m max however.

Also, the Chosen Bio Rifles have the same ammo capacity as the Accord, but half the fire rate, with twice the damage *(and healing!)* per round. This means twice the effective damage without reloading or grabbing an ammo drop/calldown. Plinking is also far easier, moving away from the spray-and-pray I recall from my last attempt to use the frame.

All in all, the Dragonfly has become a highly effective frame, both solo and grouped, with Healing Wave, Healing Pillar, and Poison Trail all offering reliable AoE damage, as well as 2 extra heals to back up the  Rifle.

- accord dread who got nerfed a while ago and no longer does head shots. Used to be my favorite frame, now the arhanas are bullet sponge and is more of a liability in a group.


- thumper interaction: i can call one down from the arctic circle, but i have to be within 5ft to sent it back up? It makes no sense, it's (was) prone to bugs, it's irritating and an arbitrary condition that adds nothing.


- 5 min thumper cooldown, i mean, seriously! 


- lateral movement while flying that takes up more energy that going straight up (not talking about jetsprint here).


- Accord's total obliviousness to simple 'door' technology. Give these towers some basic defense mechanism for pete's sake! And when the chosen does gets it, we'd have to deal with these defenses to take it back! A barrier field, some turrets, mines ... anything! My tent is more secure than these towers! :p


- fine movement: Trying to inch forward when you're on a ledge, or if you land on certain slanted terrain, will sent you tumbling down at ballistic speed. This is aggravating when you're trying to snipe, especially when you can stand on much steeper terrain elsewhere. 


- the ARES insta-MOB-spawn-as-soon-as-you-touch-the-objective-mechanic. It arcs back to the DOOM years where all hell would predictably break loose as soon as you touch the key. Wasn't fun back then, it isn't now either and in some location is a death sentence since they'll spawn all around you. 


- Thumper difficulty/reward ratio that is out of whack.


- Ores that spawn in unthumpable terrain like on rocks or under ridge. It's always the nice ores as well!


- death penalty ... :p

1375022109.0	1j7sia	Pew Pew Pew: a Rhino Guide	Israndel	16	7	14	"INTRO!

Now before I begin, I want to tell a short story of how I got to playing Rhino with mostly Rhino-exclusive gear/abilities. I've been around since before Rhino's unique ability was explosive rounds, so I've seen it all, and always have wanted to make this frame work for me. With all the tumult of balancing and addition of new abilities, this was a hard task, and at first I agreed with most people that the Rhino was effectively unplayable when compared to the more straightforward mammoth. Well, after sticking with the 'frame, testing my resolve (and funds!) with upgraded Rhino abilities, I found some wonderful synergy. My risk was rewarded, and I've been reaping profits of both fun and crystite!

HOW? AN EXAMPLE

I'll rattle off my build first, then discuss. Heavy Armor II, Gravity Field II, Sundering Wave II, LHMG II, Dreadnaught Plating II, Rhino Passive II, Servos I, Jets I, Grenade Launcher I, and Mortar HKM I.

Here's how a fight goes with this; let's go with a chosen squad, my favorite prey: 

1. Put a bunch of lasers downrange as you close in, because you can hit them, and hit them for full damage at a range that other dreads could only dream of.

2. Proactively deploy heavy armor, which synergizes with the Rhino passive to give you some 180hp shield for 3.5 seconds, which also takes reduced damage thanks to the armor! This roughly equates to soaking a direct-hit Juggernaut shot before you start taking (reduced) damage, good absorption indeed!

3. If they are scattering before you, deploy gravity field to stop that nonsense (66% speed reduction). They will take increased damage (10%), and you can stand behind the black-hole as deployable cover; you are tall enough to fire over it, while still protecting the lower half of your body, effectively reducing your hit-box ~50% with proper positioning.

4. If they boldly stand against you, cram yourself up in their face and sunder them with Sundering Wave, doing some 690 damage (benefits from its own damage amp, cool!) and increasing damage dealt by some 16%.

After this, it's all dependent on what's left. If you have some now-crippled and damage-vulnerable enemies clumped up, might want to mash them with your grenade launcher. If they're finally getting the idea and are scattering, your LHMG was made for this; gun them down at range, and if you have a Raptor with you, ask for a Power Field and scythe through the remainders with an infinite-ammo secondary-fire sweep!

Of course if you have your HKM, it should be used for tough clumps of enemies, but it also does good damage to individual targets (even compared to your LHMG); if you're having trouble getting a bead on an especially jumpy, annoyingly damaging foe, don't feel bad using your HKM to blow 'em away.

BREAKDOWN

Throwing yourself into the thick of combat, blasting abilities every couple seconds that cripple and obliterate your enemies' ability to fight back, while dishing out significant, reliable damage at any practical range is very satisfying. The synergy afforded a Rhino is not to be understated: with its proactive passive, you can wade into danger that anything but a mammoth would laugh at as an insane move.

But you are Rhino, not Mammoth, and you deliver firepower-amplifying abilities that make you an unstoppable wrecking ball. It should be noted that Gravity Field and Sundering Wave's damage amps stack, meaning I get a **26 percent damage boost** when I sunder them after having cornered them with my gravity field!

The Rhino isn't a frame that needs good gear to succeed any more than any other frame is; while the stock mammoth (with the Accord Passive installed) could outlast nearly any other frame, it will take you *ages* to take down what a well-equipped 'frame could.

It's important to understand that the same strategies for mammoth will not carry over to Rhino; you are not a pillar of plasma-fire, but instead a battlefield-controller: the Rhino demands the attention of its enemies by threatening impaired mobility and increased damage against its opponents, whereas the Mammoth demands attention as a constant, durable, melee-range PHMG threat. What I'm trying to say is that you are not the Immovable Object; you are the Unstoppable Force.

You are Rhino."	t5_2s629	True

I've managed to craft all my tier 1 gear no problems, and I've progressed along the 3...channels?  or whatever they are in the battleframe garage (adding power / cores / cpu to my stats I think) until I hit the first tier of green unlocks, which each require 10,000 of a specific resource.  I note that those unlocks each give me a 'pilot token', and I already have 3 pilot tokens (again, I think this is how it works) from lower unlocks.

If I select the bastion in the battleframe station I see that I need 10 tokens, or 100 red beans to unlock it so.... 

1) Am I right in thinking I need to unlock another 7 pilot tokens through the battleframe garage (each of which requires a huge amount of resources) to unlock the bastoion that way?

2) Is there currently any way to aquire red beans?  I know you get some with the founders package, which I'm happy to for out for...but can I apply that package to my current account, or would I need to start again?

Again, apologies if these are noob questions, but the whole battleframe progression thing seems a bit muddy at the moment (I appreciate it's a beta, not finished etc)"	t5_2s629	True

1365732055.0	1c6gho	What's your upgrade priority on frames?	omegaorb	11	1	6	"When I say upgrade priority, I mean everything. Which of the white slots do you upgrade first? Do you horde a bunch of resources with one character and start making your next frames first set of gear and abilities, or do you grind the materials on the frame to farm the exp? Do you prioritize some stats over others? Do you have a specific slot you'll use a subpar quality item in, so you can use a higher quality, heavier/more CPU intensive item in another? 

Here's how I'm usually running it;

Switch into new frame, use stock accord gear to begin farming. 


- Priorities on frame is to max out power first for the damage bonus, then either of the others.

- Item priority order is; primary weapon, armor, servos, jump jets, most used ability, secondary weapon, remaining upgrades.


- Primary weapon and armor are the only two items I'm very strict on quality for, 800+. Everything else I'll be satisfied with 400-600 quality items. 


- Since I plan on taking most of the base frames into green for pilot points, I usually prepare second rank items when I get close to my first 10K mineral point.


Share your ideas, maybe someone has another way they do things, and I want to know why so I can try to find the most efficient path to playing each character and get some min/maxing moving along.

1360161062.0	17zzyh	PvE Recon seems really underpowered	scotsman4321	11	3	47	"I came back to Firefall after playing many many months ago.  I remember the recon being pretty good, but not great in PvE, and average in PvP.  It seems like since then, they got the nerf bat really hard.  The gun needing to be ""Charged up"" to do its normal damage is a huge nerf.  Sure you can say that waiting in between shots is similar to the old firing rate on the hard hitting snipers, but it seems like waiting is at least twice as long to get the full damage shot.

I do like the abilities long range mine, and resonating bolts, but other than that, the skills seem bland/worthless.  

Being the weakest class, I'd like to see the recon have more power.  More power and even less accuracy would be acceptable.  Some variance in the sniper rifle, instead of it being laser accurate  would possibly be a good trade off.

I played a lot of PvP last night with t1 recon and as an average player, I did pretty well, so I'm not sure that is really in need of any big change.  Thumping though, I see no other class weaker than recon by a large margin.  Sniping the explosive guys, and ranged dudes is important, but having to be scoped in more often than before really makes the recon, the most blind of all classes.  Just my thinking after playing for the last couple days for first time in a long time

*Edit.  After thinking about it some more, having to be ""Scoped in"" is really what I hate the most.  It leaves you blind out there, and if you scope out to look around, you lose all damage for a few seconds once you scope back in.  The best solution would be to have your damage bar move up, whether scoped in, or not.  Rattling off shots could still do a lot less damage, but the first shot after a few seconds should hit hard.  While the same bullet out of a gun ever does different damage (assuming you are hitting the same target) is about as non-intuitive as it gets, forcing a class to be perma-scoped in/half blind to do similar damage to other classes with their main gun is also kind of silly to me."	t5_2s629	True

The rule was put in place to help promote content on the sub-reddit instead of just betakey posts.  As of late though there had been a lot of beta key offers in posts with content.  This kind of bypasses the rule but doesn't make it fair to normal betakey posters.

I would like to update the rule so that (beyond big beta news like open weekends), no title should have ""beta key"" in it.  Text posts are welcome to have it in the content but not the title.

There are many red links (dead ends with no info) or outdated information on the site.  I think this would be an amazing resource to have for new and old players alike.  But like most, I don't have the time to help as much as I would like.

The content is all user driven so there hasn't been much push from R5 beyond saying 'this ones the official one'.  The question is how do we get more attention on the site and get more interest in creating/updating it?

I think we (reddit? firefall community? RED5?) should put forward a weekly 'spotlight' on a topic of Firefall.  Aka, the first could be ""Creatures of Firefall"" where people add/expand on the creature lists and pages.  Then move on to other topics like ""thumping"", ""Chosen (Group)"" [aka not ""Chosen (Creature)""], and so on.  Users can then try to put effort into updating such things.

I wish I could give rewards for contributors but Trading in-game isn't available yet.  Though if the idea gets popular enough, I can see about working something out.

Sadly I don't have time to read the forums so this might have been discussed before but I wanted to put it out there.  Otherwise, any input on this or other ideas?  Can R5 pop in some input on this as well?  "	t5_2s629	True

* This is a 1-day tournament. All matches will be played on the day of the tournament. Be prepared to play many matches in succession. Each team is allowed to register up to 9 members for the tournament. If you want a player on your team to be able to play in the tournament you must have them registered for that particular tournament before the event starts, not just on your team roster.

* Check-in: To ensure the event is smooth and starts on time. Teams must check-in prior to the start of the tournament to confirm participation. To check-in, at least one team member must click the “Check me in now” button on the tournament page. If you see a checkmark next to your team’s name on the team page of the tournament, you’re all set.

* IRC Chat: After checking in, team leaders or a representative from your team must be logged in and in the IRC Chat room: #Z33K on irc.quakenet.org, or #Z33K on irc.globalgamers.net. IRC chat is available from the website if you are unable to reach an admin in-game.
* Brackets: Brackets for the event will be posted with random seeding, and once brackets are up matches begin immediately. Find your team name and your opponent, challenge them and play the number of rounds specified. To challenge another team run the command “/challenge name number” where name is the team of your opponent, and number is the map number.
* Reporting Results: When you complete a match, you must report the result on the brackets. To do so, click on your team name on the bracket and hit ""report match result"". When prompted, indicate the winning team. If you or your opponent accidentally report the result incorrectly, please contact an admin so they can reverse the result, have a screenshot ready.

But anyway, back on topic. I am trying to buy a firefall 20$ founders pack and I get to the part for my postal code and it consistantly gives me a ""please use the proper format"" error. Maybe, I'm an idiot but no matter what I have tried so far it keeps giving me this error.

I am a Canadian, so my ""proper format"" would be the second one: j6y 2b9 

I don't want to post my actual postal code in here but holy shit, seems simple enough to me.... So why isn't it working? Anyone else have similar issues trying to purchase from Canada? If not, then how do I get in touch with their support because apparently their system hates where I live. -_-

It's been going pretty slow for me, honestly, not having much publicity and all. This is my attempt to advertise while looking for more work for myself.

If anyone has any match IDs they want me to shoutcast, or a good place to find more of them, it'd be cool if you could throw them in my general direction and I could shoutcast them, you can watch them shoutcasted, and everyone wins, unless I'm terrible at it, in which, you will cry.

And, while I'm here, I'll just shamelessly plug my channel so you can look at my videos and decide if you want me to shoutcast or not.

If there are no Tier 1 Matches to practice on, I'll just start doing Tier 2. Eventually, I want to be able to put out 5 of these videos per week, but that's eventually.

1338501038.0	uek5c	Minor Revisions notes for 31 May 2012	hcranomythgim	9	0	3	"  **Game Changes**

*  ""A Tough Nut to Crack"" will now require that a player completes the objective ""Find the Silicate Deposit Field"" before it will allow the player to progress the main objective.

* Adjusted spawn tables to spawn in less creature nests at once. This should hopefully make the ""spawning in the same spot right after you kill them"" happen less often.

* Tuned the camera and field of view transitions when changing between running, sprinting, and jetting while in third person to be a bit smoother.

* All deployed turrets should despawn at the end of a match on OCT. No more dying to a turret while staring at the score screen.
*  Roaches will burrow to a player at most 100m away. Players respawning in town should no longer have roaches teleporting into the spawn point with them!

* The login screen will now notify you if you are running a video card driver different than the latest release.

* Optimized lighting effects to increase performance.


   **Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug where changing your toggle settings for zoom would leave you stuck in zoom if you were zoomed in while making the change.

* Orbital Comm Tower forcefields on points B and C should allow you to re-enter your base.

* Fixed some holes in the world.

* Players should be able to deploy the Medium Healthpack Calldown once again.

* The Dreadnaught's Heavy Armor ability should no longer persist when changing battleframes.

* The alarm sounds on Orbital Comm Tower should now reset on round switch.

* Fixed an issue with nVidia 460 SE v2 cards that would cause water to not render properly.

* Fixed issues with returning to open world while in a squad.

* Fixed multiple instances of server crashes.

At first this definitely seems annoying and isn't much of a reward to many long time players. I think we should all think about exclusivity and rarity before we complain about hard it can be obtain certain things. In MMOs many people strive to set themselves apart, through skill and looks. Rare items make your character standout because not everyone has them. I think it is good for these beta items to be hard to obtain. It is good for have rare items. If I do earn myself some angel wings I don't want everyone under the sun to have them as well, they would be less special that way. 

 Obviously these items won't be the rarest of the rare, hundreds of people will have most of these I am sure. I do think everyone in the closed beta should be given some mark of that feat, some sort of mask or other way to say you were here before everyone knew this game was awesome.

I've been playing Firefall for one year now and have seen good things and bad things evolving from within the confines of Red5. One thing I have seen no evolution of, however, is what happens between you hitting 0 HP and the few moments after you respawn. I find it lacking in all mechanics and could use an overhaul. 

I have taken a bit of a peek into these failed mechanics and put a [suggestion thread together with Feedback Voting](http://www.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/how-death-works.80723/) in hopes that R5 will make adjustments on this in the future.

If you guys could take a read and provide some commentary, myself and the progress of the game would be appreciative! "	t5_2s629	True

1355255335.0	14oid0	Question: How exactly do battleframe tiers work?	Kamigawa	9	3	7	"This question is fairly simple. So I leveled up my Recon battleframe enough to unlock the T2 raptor. In my ""battleframe station"", I have a T1 Recon, and a T1 engineer. First, I notice the XP is per-battleframe, or at least, the XP I have on my T1 Recon is separate from the one I have on my T1 Engineer. Did I get this right?

Secondly, to get a T2 battleframe, it seems I have to use a new Battleframe slot and craft it. Is this correct? If not, how do I ""upgrade"" my T1 to T2? If so, some followup questions:

Are the items I unlocked on T1 Recon usable on T2? If I destroy my T1 recon to make room for T2, but now I want to unlock the other T2 battleframe, will I have my old XP when I re-make my T1 Recon frame?

Basically, my question is how exactly are you supposed to use battleframes? The station is somewhat confusing to me, especially because of how limited it is. Why would anyone want to keep a T1 frame around when they can make a T2 one? Do they lose all their progress in that frame if they destroy it? Etc.

Thanks for any light y'all can shed.

*Edit:* Thanks a lot for your responses, all great news! If anyone involved with the game sees this, I would make a suggestion that when/if a tutorial is made, these answers are mentioned, or that the UI makes it a little more obvious.

Firefall uses a rather rare RFC implementation of http traffic in it's networking implementation and this can cause a problem with some firewall and network security scanner implementations. You do not need to turn off your whole security suite, disabling network filtering will be enough.

In particular:
Any product that is based on F-Secure core and is brand new does have this problem. We have identified the problem and a initial fix is made. You can get the fix in our beta program already next week (beta.f-secure.com), if you are using F-Secure Internet Security 2013 or some of the co-branded ISP builds we have you will eventually receive a fix through a channel update, but we will also make a manual patch available for you. If you really are in a hurry, this will disable the problematic component, leaving rest of the product running:

* run cmd prompt with admin rights
* cd to the installation directory, default C:\Program Files (x86)\F-Secure (this could be your operator security suite name too)
* type: fshoster32.exe -StopPlugin -plugin:NID
* to recover: fshoster32.exe -StartPlugin -plugin:NID

If you see any other problems with these products and Firefall (or any game for that matter), you can contact me through Reddit and I'd be happy to help.

2. do you have to make a frequent trip between the field and the HQ for ammo refills? 
3. what happens if i got lost (this happens often) and can't find my way back? 
4. anyone know where i could buy a top hat in Indonesia?

**Squad:** About 5 man is ideal, preferably one assault and one bio.

**Location:** -125,2100 It used to be a bugspot, now its a working respawnpoint with a garage etc. The roofs are a safe retreat spot, with health bubbles and ammo spawning.  The respawnpoint is almost on top of the spot you are thumping.

**What to do:** Put three thumpers in a triangle, have the assault and the bio help out whichever thumper needs help. The other three guys all have one thumper they guard.  Creeps come in waves, its even more expressed with the latest patch so you occasionally have dead moments.  This is no longer the case when trianglethumping. Just help out the nearest thumper while waiting for the next wave to arrive.

The current thumper replication bug is also helping out a lot, since loosing a thumper isnt as bad at the moment. I think I will give Square Thumping a try later tonight :)"	t5_2s629	True

Its up the cliffs.  Theres a plateau, with a 'stairs' (several smaller plateau's) leading to the upper plateau.  You can put your thumper up the first stair and hardly any creep can get to it.  There is azurite spawning at the lower plateau and the upper plateau every 5-10 minutes.

I have been solo thumping there, with my thumper rarely going below 50 percent.  In the middle area, the stairs, there is also a spot where you can lock yourself inbetween rock and put on autorun so you dont get logged out if you leave for 15 minutes or more. It's a wedge shape, so you will move a bit but you will remain in the hole. I managed to go out and buy cancersticks at the local nightshop and come back, without having to login and run all the way back :)

I'll take a screenshot next time i get there, but my game crashed after 4 hours ='(

**Coordinates**: 1622,-1161

**XP gain**: about 10K an hour

**How to get there**: get jumpjets that use few energy to jump.  Regeneration and thrust are not that important.  Also, afterburner is really nice to scale cliffs.  Just remember to look up, before using it. You want up thrust not forward thrust.

1376238370.0	1k5eep	Firefall Economy Discussion.	BrainKatana	13	5	21	"Last week I wrote [a summary post](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/1jmm6r/a_firefall_lament/) on how I felt on the current state of the game. To my surprise it prompted a response from Phobos. I really appreciate his attention to the community and willingness to communicate with us.

To clarify, I think Firefall has one of the best short gameplay loops in years. I also feel like the majority of my listed concerns in my previous post are quite valid. I believe that the talented guys at Red 5 are trying to make their ""best game ever."" However, there was quite a bit of discussion in the comments about one thing in particular: *permanent item loss.* After spending some time playing the game and paying attention to how the gathering, itemization, crafting, and progression systems intertwine, I think it's something that worth discussing, especially with all the hullabaloo about it from a couple of months ago. As I considered the topic, I realized that permanent item loss wasn't the issue. The issue is the economy as a whole, particularly how it is perceived by a large part of the player base.

**The Common Complaint Rebuttal**

Simply saying ""it's not that bad, I can easily re-craft all my gear in the amount of time it takes my current gear to break"" isn't the point here. If anything, this is potentially a part of a problem that I'll discuss in this post.

**The Economy**

Red5 devs are on-record saying that the reason items degrade is to facilitate a virtual economy for crafting and item sales between players. However, when it's ""easy"" for everyone to re-craft all their gear before their current kit expires, this relationship doesn't exist in a truly codependent way. It's always more individually lucrative for a player to grind their way through the crafting research and make their own gear than it is for them to purchase crafted items from the marketplace, because crafting research is a permanent, one-time crystite spend.

**The Messaging (players ""intuiting"" the game)**

Everyone can craft with a relatively minimal barrier-to-capability. Constantly receiving material rewards from ancillary sources (supply crates, *any* mission/event rewards) combined with the impermanence of gear causes players feel pressure to craft for themselves instead of just doing the content they enjoy. For players more interested in doing missions, Thumping/Researching/Crafting becomes a chore at best. At worst, it becomes a significant barrier to their enjoyment of the game. I know many of you have felt this way; I've seen the posts here and in the official forums (e.g. ""I feel like I have to be constantly gathering to replace my crafted gear).

**The Marketplace**

*Ugh. It's alpha at best, but dammit, it's in the game, so I'll talk about it.*

There are quite a few good examples for Red5 to follow here. Guild Wars 2 and EVE Online are two such examples, though they don't require the complexity of EVE's marketplace. There's really so much to improve upon that wouldn't be good form to mention them individually (beta and all, I'm sure they're working on it), so I'll just say this: Every single crafting material, crafted subcomponent, and crafting component should be tradable. These lists should be sortable by price and quality. Allowing players to assign their own opportunity cost for rare materials and components (e.g. Baneclaw bits for Mammoth Plating) will help to create a dynamic economy by allowing players who prefer spending time crafting to acquire the necessary materials without being required to engage in combat.

**A Proposed Solution**

* Remove resource rewards from everything but thumping and supply crates. I know this is how it used to be, but that was pre-marketplace.
* Increase thumping material rewards to offset the loss of material rewards from other sources.
* To offset the removal of resource rewards, increase Crystite rewards for ARES, Crashed LGV, Downed Thumper, etc mission events. Add a ""bounty"" to Chosen kills that is auto-rewarded.
* As stated above, make *everything* trade-able on the marketplace, assuming it hasn't been used.
* Increase crafting slots somehow
* Increase research costs/time and crafting time across the board. Make it more of a barrier to entry than an annoyance.

Under the assumption that these changes are economically balanced by Red5 systems designers, this will create a division between resource gathering (thumping), manufacturing (crafting), and shard defense (ARES, Incursions, Strike Teams, Invasions). This division will help a virtual economy flourish by creating a resource demand (manufacturers need thumpers) and an item demand (defenders need high quality gear from manufacturers). As an added bonus, manufacturers will be able to focus on manufacturing without having to go farm for specific specialized items (i.e. Hisser DNA). Since the common item needed to progress in any of those 3 directions (combat, gathering, crafting) is Crystite, the result would hopefully be an economy that is governed by players' earning power instead of whatever random need the current group of low-end progressing players have. 

Naturally, in order for any of this to work, Red5 would have to dramatically improve both the Crafting Interface and the Marketplace UI. Figuring out how to appropriately monetize these systems is also important as the game is F2P, but I'm sure Red5 has a plan in place that they're constantly executing on, such as the cosmetic bonuses currently available for red bean purchases.

I'm looking forward to what you guys think of this, and can't wait to see your discussion in the comments.

NyghtSpydr	10	4	29	"I just started playing yesterday and I feel completely lost in this game. I really like it, but I just don't understand much about it. I have a few questions that I am hoping some veterans could assist me with. I have looked at the forums, but there is just so much other stuff going on there its hard to find the answers to my questions. 

1) I understand this game is in BETA. How long has it been around?

2) Upon Full Release, will we BETA players get to keep our characters and skills that we have trained up?

3) Currently the game has very basic ""quests"", and in all actuality they aren't quests, correct? They are more like ""events"" that anyone can join in and participate, like ARES Events? 

4) Will there ever be an actual quest system, or a storyline that a player will follow as they play the game?

5) What do we do with the resources that we gather from Thumping? I took them to the manufacturing machine (??) and it only seemed like I could refine them into some other resource...but what do i do with that resource? I haven't quite figured out how to construct items...

6) Speaking of items, I take it we can make new weapons and other gear with the resources we collect and refine? Where do i find the ""plans"" for these items? Do I buy them or find them?

7) Thumping: I have participating in many thumping ""sessions"" and one thing I noticed is sometimes there are only a few or weaker enemies, and other times it is like Hell spawned on us...what is going on? Why such a difference in enemy waves?

8) Is there currently only one server for everyone to connect to? A game like WoW had 20+ servers, so I am curious if I am missing something, or do we all play on the same server? I say this because I want to know if I am looking for a friend, will they always be playing where I am playing or what?

9) Crystalis (??) When fighting enemies, I see this stuff drop, but other players don't pick it up. Does it only drop for me on the ones that I have killed, so basically the other players don't see it? I think with Squads, everyone sees it...so do Squads split the loot?

10) What is the deal with ""overloading"" your Battleframe? I heard a warning about this, but I am not exactly sure what that means. 

11) Yes I enjoy the game, but is it worth it to buy the Founders pack? Do you get your money's worth with this purchase?


EDIT: 12) Does the game support routing game audio through headphones or do i need to set that within Windows before playing? I know it can route voice chat, but I was hoping you can set game audio from within the game. Can't find the option...

Thanks everyone for taking time to read this and hopefully answer. Appreciate it. 


EDIT: I just bought the Commander Founder Pack! I have been reading all I can about this game and it looks like it will be awesome, so I had to get in when I could and show support for the awesome Dev team!

1370238590.0	1fkdlq	ReForging, new idea on how Durability should work.	zVulture	11	4	5	"Posted on the [Firefall forums](http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/reforging-new-idea-on-the-current-system.478041/) but here is the text:

Playing the game recently I have come across the annoyance of repair and it's possible crystite costs. At the current rate of spending crystite for crafting, unlocks and trying to save for a MAN or other large purchase, the idea of a crystite repair cost seems like fighting constant setbacks put in place by R5. I say that it 'seems' and not 'is'. Perception is a big deal in games in general and more so when making something longer lasting. Instead of just complaining (Grummz got a big dose of that on Reddit recently), I wanted to come up with a solution that still kept Durability in the game.

As it currently stands, there are two stats that have their own resource pools: Durability and Repair. They both don't belong together in one system, kind of like how Quality on resources was making things too annoying/complicated. No one likes to keep having to go repair items or constantly be dumping crystite (not live yet) into it knowing they will just have to make a new item once it breaks. It needs to be one or the other and I believe that a Durability (item-break) system would just fit better overall. Below is my idea on how/why this could work:

Create a nanoprint called ReForge that can be used on an equipable item to remake the item:

Input 1 - Equipable Item (weapon/ability/etc)  
Input 2 - Primary Resource *+  
Input 3 - Secondary Resource *+  
Input 4 - Crystite +  
Optional Input 1 - Durability Module  
Optional Input 2 - CPU Module  
Duration: 15 Minutes #  

) * Primary and Secondary resources will change to match the item being put in Input 1. Aka: A Dreadnaught Weapon will require different resources than a Recon Weapon.  
) + Amounts required will be dynamic dependent on: Item's current Durability level % x Item's Tier level x Item Type  
) # Duration should be Low for ease of use, though defaulting to the same time as crafting an item is also an option.  

Use:
Remove the constant repair work needed and add a mechanic that is so easy to use people are not as bothered by the costs. Nor will people need to throw away broken items and need to use the complex system to craft new ones (more so for T2). Also this will allow users to add Module(s) to an item even after it has been created. A new item would have all or most of it's durability so the resource cost would be low.

Quality Mechanic up for debate:
The quality of the resources put into Input 2 and 3 can improve/degrade the items quality depending on the resource put into them. This effect should have a buffer value so it doesn't just average the qualities. This prevents people from using the system to cheaply upgrade their gear and doesn't hurt players as bad for using lower quality resources to ReForge with. This also makes just creating a new item a valid option if they want to make a better item.

Modules:
The modules will need to be re-purchased each time the item is ReForged otherwise it will loose the benefit. Lower the current crystite costs of them though so it doesn't hurt so much to ReForge an item this way. Below are a few ideas though on what modules could work with this new system. Values can be adjusted as well as prices with a bit of testing to balance things out.

Re-vamped Durability Modules:  
Slow Use Damage by (5/10/15/20/25 %)  
Slow Death Damage by (5/10/15/20/25 %)  
Slow Use and Death Damage by (5/10/15 %)  

Re-Vamped CPU Modules:  
Lower Mass (10/20/30/40/50%)  
Lower Power (10/20/30/40/50%)  
Lower Mass and Power (10/20/30 %)  
Increase Max Power Buff (5/10/15/20/25 %)   "	t5_2s629	True

1368010942.0	1dxbes	Playing around with suggesting the idea of Repair Kits, would like some feedback	Hides_In_Plain_Sight	8	4	7	"Myself and a few friends were coming up with several ideas for what could improve the durability/repair pool system without outright removing it (this is built on the assumption that it's here to stay, so I won't go off-topic talking about whether the system should stay or not), and one of us came up with a better version than the rest of us. Since I don't think he's going to post it anywhere, I'll do it instead, as I think it's a good idea to sling on the Red5 forums or the beta suggestion page.

Preamble over, here's the idea: craftable Repair Kits. The idea would be that they can be crafted with any material(s), probably from multiple components and crystite combined, with a final quality value based on the materials going in, as you'd expect. The Kit could then be used to add back to the Repair Pool of an item, with a very strict limitation: a Repair Kit can only add to the Repair Pool of an item with equal or lower quality.

There could be different levels of kit for different amounts of Repair Pool refilling, but the cost of the kit would have to be reasonably high; any kit that could fill the Repair Pool all the way back to full would have to cost nearly as much (in terms of quantity of materials going in) as the original item would have done.

However, because the Kit would be craftable with any minerals, it would still require the same sort amount of Thumping/Trading/whatever to acquire what you need, but without the pain of having to seek out a very specific mineral at a worthwhile quality; you'd have to find that high quality, but not for that one specific mineral. Got some spare 987 Bio-Organic Stintergels? Put it towards a kit to fix your Nighthawk's 903 Rifle!

This would mean that you'd still have to work to keep your good gear, but it'd also mean that all minerals will be useful to all people. Anyone could find a decent use for Purple-quality, and would always have a reason to go thumping still, or buy minerals through trading (when that goes in), and still means that the higher your gear's quality, the harder you have to work to keep it usable. Managed to scrape enough 1000 quality together to make the tastiest gun ever? You're still going to have to put in the work to keep it in one piece, but you're not going to have to pray that you can get your hands on that one specific mineral again.

To me, this can allow the spirit of the durability changes to stay (a way to keep the economy going strong, and to make sure that don't just craft one awesome set of gear and then run out of things to do without WoW-esque constant vertical progression content being added), but with much less of the headache associated, and the bonus of making all minerals attractive for people (I don't know about you, but if I'm after something specific and it's not present in decent quality, I instantly feel a tad less inclined to play).

I stopped playing because I got bored of the immediate available area around copa. Figured I'd give them time to release new things, and I'm glad I did. Came back and there's tons to do now. After patching on Friday, I logged in Saturday, went through the tutorial, and reentered the world. Followed the new, awesome arrows for the intro quest, and ran into a squad doing a small squad thumper. Got an invite after dropping a turret down to help, went through 4 or 5 thumping with them, walked out with somewhere around 35k exp (hot damn do these nade launchers grind exp on swarmed thumpers) and a mass quantity of minerals that meant nothing to me yet.

Went back to copa, checked out the garage, did some upgrades, actually did some reading and exploring of the interface, used chat to ask questions, got some smart ass answers but mostly useful ones, and went to a printer. Now, I'm used to a learning curve, but wow. The printer is like relearning Eve. Started out small, wanted to upgrade my nade launcher, so I opened it up. Needed components, opened up subcomponents, found I had material for one of them and not the other. Damn. More questions, more answers in chat. Started some hour long refining, went thumpin. Couldn't find resource on my own, so I looked at my map and realized there were purple thump group marks all over it. Did some mouse covers, found what I needed, got there and it was deserted. Well that sucks, guess I'll do it on my own. Got some resources, went back to copa, rinse, repeat on the refine and print, kick myself for not looking at the other components for the item, back to thumpin. Total time so far, 3 hours, and somewhere around 55-60 k total exp gained. Fast forward to making the new item. Get it done, realize I made the second tier launcher for a different frame. Can't use it double over. Ask questions, realize in my zeal I made a mistake, whatever. Somewhere along the way gain an understanding of mineral grades, start dropping the hammer as I walk, always. Every time I hit a 900+ patch of anything, drop 3 or 4 thumpers and move on. Go back to copa for the night, upgrade all the white on my frame, realize there's actual bonuses that would have helped earlier, feel dumb again, set up multi hour refines, go spend time with the wife, and enjoy Saturday night. Total time, 9 hours on the day.

Sunday, wake up and spend my first 1.5 hours at the printer. Opened an excel book on the other screen, started mapping out items and resources. Crafted out new servos, jumps, primary weapon, plating, glider pads, a small personal and small squad thumper while mapping. Figure out what I want for the day, and get to work. Check my frame, add in things I made, asked some questions, learned about the badges/ribbons. Set up some refining on the ones I had, and went exploring. The first set of basic upgrades made a night and day difference for me. After about 7 hours of Ares, downed thumpers, chosen pods, thumping, and exploring I go back to copa, set refines, and spend the afternoon with the woman. Evening rolls around, get back on, finish all first tier of gear, start looking to getting my next frame. See 10k mineral requirement, and know what I'm doing for the evening. I ask some questions, people suggest leveling other frames and getting pilot points, but the engineer is so damn fun. Decide I'll actually grind the progress, and after about 5 hours, I'm at 8900 minerals, should be able to upgrade my frame next Sunday and have tier 1 done for all new frame items. Time to wrap up the night. Watch a movie with the wife, read some reddit, find this sub, and just shake my head at people complaining. 

One thread said something about mature non basement dwellers with with jobs not having time to grind. I call you a quitter. Make time. My weeks are busy, but my weekends are mostly mine. I made time for the wife, and she was content to let me play 21 hours this weekend. I get that in the day of instant ""no work, all reward"" MMO's, you come to fire fall and start bitching. Maybe its not the game for you then. If it makes you complain this much, leave and go do something you enjoy. As for me, I'll now split my weekend game time between this and League, because I really like where this game is going.

Tl;dr - I manned the fuck up and played smart after asking questions and actually interacting. Most of you complaining are bitches."	t5_2s629	True
1364940002.0	1bjmhp	No immediate gratification to feed my interest	Desmadona	10	5	19	"While I find a lot of things about this game inventive and interesting (the flashlight at night. Seriously the best thing ever.), I'm having trouble staying motivated to grind resources when I haven't gained any rewards (gear, damage or healing increases, etc...) for the work I've done so far. I've opened up all but one of the white on my dragonfly and have seen zero perceptible increase in my power, speed, or efficiency. My main heal still heals for 510, which is what it healed for with no white cleared at all.

It seems that all I have to look forward to when I hit green (after grinding 10k resources from who knows where) is more grinding to make upgraded gear that, according to other sources on the internet of lies, might increase my output by 12 points. oooh! my heal will heal for 522 instead of 510! Woohoo! Hell yea!
Then what? More grinding for minimal increases in speed, power, or efficiency?

For me, this game is missing the gradual increases that keeps that carrot dangling in front of me, giving me a reason to continue. It has this itty bitty teeny tiny carrot 10 miles down the road, which might be worth it if I had absolutely nothing else to do with my time.

Can someone please explain to me where their motivation comes from? I'm assuming I'm missing something big here. This really can't be all there is to it. Can it?"	t5_2s629	True
1364464197.0	1b63tf	ThumpQuest?	bassow	6	1	27	"So, I finally started playing a few days ago, after the 0.6 patch launched. The current phase of the game is the only one I know. After getting to know the dynamics, I'm honestly a bit disappointed: The only way to advance seems to be (to me, right now) thumping. You get better by improving your gear, which needs resources, which needs thumping. Even leveling your XP tiers need resources. And thumping nets you plenty of XP anyway. Any cash you get can't really be spent on anything. You can hope to get into a portal or mine nodes, but they net you far less resources/hour than thumping ever would.

I know this is a beta, I know the patch was pretty invasive and I know balancing is an ongoing thing. I am just curious if there is an aspect of the game I have overlooked. I'd love to find a new part of the game that poses a new kind of challenge and is rewarding at the same time.

TL;DR: It all seems to be about thumping. Am I doing something wrong?

EDIT: Also, what is up with refining? Why is that even there?"	t5_2s629	True
1364333559.0	1b2g9m	Fame progression, how I understand it.	rgzdev	9	2	6	"**tl;dr: skip to suggestions**

***** Frame progression, how I understand it *****

Okay so, unlike other games where you get abilities by unlocking skills in a tech-tree, in current Firefall you get new abilities by unlocking Battle Frames.

Battle Frames come with a preset of abilities and weapons, in other words, items. It's impossible to mix and match items from different frames; the exception being non-Arclight Accord abilities (slots 1-3) (T1) which can be used in ""After Market"" frames (T2) of the same type. So other than retaining some T1 abilities in T2 frames there is no customization in frames beyond tweaking and turning knobs with crafting.

What I mean with crafting and turning knobs is that there is no way to make better weapons with crafting. All crafted weapons trade some stat for another. Technically there are also trait requirements but in practice trait requirements are just another stat since meeting the requirements of a item doesn't mean you don't lose in some other way.

For instance, a crafted plasma cannon might have a higher rate of fire but an smaller clip size or vice-versa. Or it can have higher RoF AND a larger clip size, but higher Mass requirements. But even if your frame meets the Mass requirements of such gun, it will still make you move slower, because of it's increased Mass.

The only way to make your frame better, unambiguously, no-small-print, counter-balance-free, no-down-sides better; is using the traits system. A.K.A. Leveling Up.

So you can't craft a better gun, but you can upgrade your power plant and it will make your gun, and all other abilities, deal higher damage. And upgrading your Mass trait will always make you move faster, period.

What this tells me is that you should forgo crafting and focus all your attention in leveling up. At low levels you level up by getting XP. XP is always good. At higher levels you are going to have to need specific resources. You need specific types of resources and you are going to want high level ones AND since getting a specific quality of an specific resource is harder than getting generic XP, you shouldn't worry about XP because by the time you get the resources you need you are going to have plenty XP to spend, so simply start thumping and thumping and thumping. In other words, business as usual. 

You are going to want to focus on Power first and Mass second, if you want to kill things. Or Mass first and Power second. If you like exploration better.

[NeonTwister](http://neontwister.blogspot.mx/2013/03/patch-06-upgrading-your-frame-and.html) tells us upgrading is roughly logarithmic, this means we are hit by the law of diminishing returns hard, XP-wise. If the benefits increase logarithmically too then there is no problem. But if they are linear or even inversely logarithmic (as I suspect, since everything is aimed at nerfing you) then you might decide to do without the last few levels of Power and start focusing on Mass (or vice-versa).

What about cores? Well cores are the only part of the crafting system that doesn't nerf your mobility or damage output. You can craft weapons to be better, without any other downside, except a higher requirement for cores. Cores of course cost XP and resources so barring some hidden performance caps I don't think it's really a good idea to invest in cores as opposed to, investing in a better power plant. The only way crafting is different than trait leveling is that it allows you to further focus on one type of item at the expense of others.

For instance you can focus on crafting servos and jump-jets with higher core requirements so your character becomes more mobile without necessarily getting a better weapon. Or you can chose to neglect your abilities at the expense of your signature weapon.

But of course the logarithmic leveling curve is coming back to haunt you, so you might make a better investment of your (life-)time by forgoing the last few levels of Power and Mass and start focusing on cores and crafting one or two items for whatever stat you want to upgrade.

UNLESS ALL THESE POINTS ARE PLAGUED BY LEVEL CAPS AND PROGRESSION CURVES. Which I expect, since the game tries so hard to thwart all your attempts at customization. Even if that's the case it doesn't change much except you might want to start investing in one trait way before you max another.

***** Suggestions *****

It reminds me of the leveling system of Skyrim where you have 3 standing stones and pray to the one that increases the type of skills you want faster. In this game they'd be Mobility, DPS and Health.

Ok so it's more complex than that. But in my opinion the progression system in Firefall only serves to obscure the already personal and hard decision of how you want to upgrade your frame.

In my (hopefully) humble opinion, the progression system should be separated completely from the crafting system. Let the crafting system be there for things that we would actually use, like call downs.

Instead of the current traits and gear system, we should have a traditional stats sheet with stats like

- Jumping

- Jump-jets

- Max Health

- Health Regen

- Walking speed

- Sprinting speed

- Clip Size

- Max Ammo

- Rate of Fire

- Reload speed

- 1st ability cool-down

- 2nd ability cool-down

- *etc*

Give each stat it's own level and it's own logarithmic curve, and let us spend XP in them like traditional RPGs. This would help us exercise what little customization options we have without having to compute resource and trait upgrading tables to figure out what combination of Power plant and number of Cores do we need to reach a target DPS. Which is what we really care about.

Possible titles: This is Firefall / Welcome to Firefall / ...

**Firefall is Free2Play online action shooter, which mixes elements from MMORPG and FPS games. If Team Fortress, Tribes and Borderlands had a baby, it would be Firefall.**

The game draws from many backgrounds.  The classes are obviously based off TF2. There are five classes.  I personally loved the Assault, which is comparable to the Soldier.  He has a rocketlike weapon, which has great area of effect damage, though no knockback.  The engineer, just like in TF2, can put down turrets at strategic points and repair them when damaged.  The recon is a sniper. He is often called the glass cannon of FF: insane damageoutput but a small health pool.  The Dreadnaught on the other hand is a heavy machinegunner. Fatty has a big health pool and is able to get more armor than any other class.  And last but not least the Biotech, a support class with an ability to heal while still being able to output enough damage to be relevant.  The devs also put time into making all the classes enjoyable to play. Its the little details that make them fun to play.  The engineer for example has a shaft like weapon, which gets a damage buff every time you hit. There is no leveling in FF, just tiers.  All the classes start out as Tier 1.  Once you have unlocked all their upgrades, you can buy a Tier 2 which allows for  more craftable upgrades. 

When you first play the game, it feels like a Borderlands clone.  The cell shader look reminds of games like League of Legends and Team Fortress 2, which basicly make the game look like ET with a config.  The game has nice graphics but does not pretend to be realistic.  Instead you get clean visuals with crips outlines; perfect for any game that wants to be competetive.  

http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Firefall-Sunken-Harbor-PvP-Trailer_8.jpg

The movement of the game is comparable to Tribes, extending the battlefield into the air using jumpsuits.  Although the game doesnt feature strafing or circle strafing, like the Quake3 engine, but it does add depth.  Jumpsuits allow you to build up speed or scale cliffs.  Just like in ET you will be using your movement to increase your tracking, you just wont be doing it only from left to right, you will also end up going up and down following your target to get those sweet juicy headshots. With some practice you can also hoversprint, which is comparable to skiing in Tribes. A neat example can be seen here.


**Why is Firefall worth playing?  The game features two seperate gameworlds.  There is the open world, which is comparable to your classis MMO but it also sports a great competetive mode.**

In the open gameworld, it is all about the resources.  The resources must flow.  To do this, you get yourself a thumper which is a mining device.  You go look for a nice spot to mine, with good resources of high quality and put down your thumper.  What ensues is remniscent of Starship Troopers, with wave after wave of aliens rushing you and your thumper.  Once you start thumping the game sets a good pace and you will be shooting and moving about all the time. You can vary the difficulty of the game by thumping alone or in group or thumping for rare resources at dangerous places.  The reason I actually enjoy the open world part of FF is because your FPS skills translate well into the game.  Its not because you play the game 24/7 and have the best gear, this also means you are the better player.  Aim, gamesense and movement all add up. Since FF is currently still in its beta stage there isnt much content and quests.  Thumping is the basic way to grind for xp and resources to craft, but does so in a really entertaining way.

&lt;Thumper Youtube clip here&gt;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDrTxS9j7p8

On the other hand the game features great PvP modes.  Deathmatch for example, puts 5 players versus 5 players on a private map outside the open gameworld.  I mentioned earlier on that classes have tiers.  You can level up a Tier1 battleframe in less then a week.  These T1 battleframes have no special items or upgrades, which makes them ideal for competetive play.  It doesnt matter how much you grind in the open world, Tier1 battlesuits will always level the playing field, leaving skill to decide who is the best.  You can compare it to ET without xp.  You can also battle it out using T2 frames, though these allow for craftable upgrades so the one who grinds the most will have an advantage.

**Winghaven and Reload have both been playing Firefall with Epsilon for a while and I asked them their impressions of the game.**

Winghaven

&gt;I really love Firefall. After ET it is the game I enjoy playing the most.  I always end up saying 'ok one more PvP and I'll quit' I haven't had this happen to me for years.  Everyone from Epsilon is really enjoying the game and we have huge expectations for the game, dont forget it is still in a beta stage. The game has everything to become a huge game:  it's fun yet it's competitive. It is a perfect game for experienced gamers and casuals alike. At the moment I am mostly playing deathmacht, but I am really looking forward to the CTF mode.  It will become the main competitive 5on5 mode and will bring more strategy and depth to the gameplay. We are still playing TDM for now, but we are having a lot of fun and it isnt even a good competetive mode. 

&gt;The devellopers really listen to the community and seem to know what they are doing. For 2013 there will be a 1.000.000 $ season which means a lot of teams and sponsors will be interested in the game, driving up the skill and competition.  Brink and Battlefield3 failed a bit in that aspect.  With so many teams playing we think it will be really hard to win.  There is also an eSports toolkit which is fucking awesome to say the least.  Check it out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrrCa6VN0Is&amp;feature=plcp 

&gt;Ofcourse there are some things which need improving.  A european server, better matchmaking, fixing bugs but it's still in beta so I expect a lot of improvements in the future.

Magicthize	9	2	49	"For those who are lucky enough to able to play I'm wondering what your impressions are of the latest milestone in comparison to the way the game used to play. Is there anything that particularly pleases you or is there something you really miss? Does this new direction fill you with fear or excitement?

I've only had a few short hours with all the new shinies and so far I've been pleased. The new xp system feels better than having the arbitrary levelling from before. The game itself feels much faster paced and I *love* the new minigun for the dreadnaught.

There are still some things that I feel need worked on - the UI for instance is often odd (eg. in the battleframe garage I have to click on my arms rather than my gun to change my weaponry) and some things I just don't feel are intuitive enough (eg I unlocked a faster spinning gun but there's no indication that I just innately have the new gun available). I'm also a little confused how the crafting system works, but perhaps I just haven't played long enough to find/unlock new items.

&gt;http://www.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/minor-revision-notes-for-thursday-may-24th.41102/

**Bug Fixes**

&gt;Fixed an error when there was a space after a slash in the chat box.

&gt;Fixed issues where the texture streaming quality setting would be automatically reverted to Highest.

&gt;Fixed problems with deploying Medium Health Pack calldown.

&gt;Fixed issues with AFK not being disabled when moving mouse or keyboard.

&gt;Fixes for issues with Swedish keyboards.



**Game Changes**

&gt;You should no longer see a player's health or name above their head when they are executed and waiting for respawn.

&gt;Modified the way animations decrease their quality over distance to prevent a lot of the popping and skipping.

&gt;The calldown menu will now sort calldowns by name instead of order purchased.

&gt;If the client receives a serious error that wouldn't normally cause a crash, you will be prompted to submit the issue after closing the game.

&gt;Improved the graphical quality of Ambient Occlusion.

&gt;Added Battleframe Terminals and Research Vendors to Trans Hub.

&gt;You will no longer be forced into 3rd person camera when interacting with a PvP terminal.

&gt;Resource scan feedback now shows ""Only Trace Minerals Found"" instead of ""100% Thumper Sifted Earth"".

&gt;Sonic Detonators have had their cooldown reduced to 1 second.

&gt;Thumper locations are now ""reserved"" for 60 seconds after a thumper is returned.

&gt;The amount of energy you have left is now preserved when you change battleframes.

&gt;The Medic's heal beam and vampiric beam are no longer healing or damaging players outside of field of view.

&gt;This is a bug that requires time to fix. In the meantime, we've set it so that the beam will not appear if you are not healing or hurting so that you at least know when you're being useful.

&gt;Reduced the damage per pellet of the Assault scattershot alt-fire from 74 to 65.

&gt;Increased the accuracy of the Dreadnaught HMG while moving.


**Known Issues**

&gt;Sometimes after leaving a PvP match, you will see a ""Mission Failed"" statement. No mission was failed.

&gt;Note: I am calling this a Minor Revision to hopefully start separating the differences between a weekly patch and a full branch at the end of a milestone. Minor revisions are bug fixes and small balance tweaks. Major revisions can include huge changes including new content, new weapons, abilities, major balance changes, etc.

Every time I'm on, I'm pretty much constantly asking if anybody has any open groups.  The only times I've had any responses, it's been newish players who only have stock personal thumpers, which don't benefit me much [seriously, as a Bastion, I can AFK them without any significant danger].

Probably_Unemployed	6	1	10	"Once I was able to understand the barrage of information they throw at you at the start of the game and once I was able to understand the complete lack of information about everything else about the game, I feel like all the game has to offer me is farming and grinding.  There's the ARES missions, which can get annoying if playing by yourself, and then thumping, which is tedious if you only have the stock thumper and are unable to handle Personal Thumper 1, but even in a group, it's still just doing horde mode over and over.  There's also the random crashed vehicles and thumpers which don't take a long time, which is fine.

I know there are the 3 melding arcfolds and I'm currently grinding for the first one (if I could find any goddamn Radine, does this shit even exist?), but beyond the first few times, I don't really know how much I'll enjoy doing them.  Combined with the fact that traveling New Eden without a vehicle is painful (dropships are sometimes bugged and when they do work, they never seem to go where I need them to go) and navigating the terrain can be quite frustrating, I'm not sure what this game has to offer me beyond mindless grinding.  There's a reason I stopped playing Diablo 3 very quickly after it came out.

1373451111.0	1hzz9g	My opinion on this game	hMJem	17	12	61	"I know I don't have some revered or desired opinion, but I figured I'd give my brief opinions on this game

I really enjoyed the gameplay. It was great to have a nice change of pace from tab targeting and rooting action combat (Talking about you, Neverwinter) and it actually flowed really well.

The world overall looked pretty nice. Nothing to blow me away, but I wasnt disappointed.

I actually had fun in Team Deathmatch PvP's. 

Here comes my biggest problem and what will probably have me not playing the game come release (or maybe within a few days)

It seems the ""end-game"" via crafting is mindlessly Thumper grinding and doing an ARES if you get bored. Am I mistaken? I felt the HUD was incredibly ugly when I got into the game, and the default controls were atrocious. Sprinting set to shift? While using W A S D to move? Come on. You might as well have started the tutorial with no controls so the player can manually set each action to a key he wanted as you load up the game to avoid having to manually switch it.

I get annoyed just thinking of the crafting. Why cant it just be gather these, find the recipe in the world or something, and make them. But instead there is a relatively ugly layout of it all in my opinion, and then refining your stuff and just way too many unnecessary quirks to try to make the crafting seem deep when really it's just annoying. And for newer players they probably dont get it at all and have to google or go to websites for help.

I know some people might say ""Sandbox MMORPG's arent just ABOUT the gear"" I know. But people want gear, and its unfortunate that it comes at such a grindy cost. In a Sandbox, since you arent typically getting your gear off monster drops, it's very important to make crafting if atleast tedious, fun. But I feel crafting in this game is tedious and not fun. And people want a way to advance their characters beyond doing the same dynamic events that get a little stale after the original hit of them wares off after a few days."	t5_2s629	True

* Afterburn, as you will learn, will make you move, and hit a fern.
* Crater seems like lots of fun, it hits real hard, if they don't run!
* Overcharge, unlike its name, makes noise and lights and pretty flame.
* Burn Jet, you can get, but while it's hot, you *will* get shot!
* Keep astray of Bombs Away!

**Dreadnaught**

* Explosive Rounds is quite a blast, but use it quick, it does not last!
* Heavy Armor used to suck, it's brief as hell, time it with luck!
* Repulsor Blast is quite alright, use it for Aranha bite.
* Turret mode - your feet will lock. It's great against that floating rock!

**Biotech**

* Triage is - recall this rhyme - how to rez your friends in time!
* Need a sniper's shot to fail? Just run around with Poison Trail!
* Healing Wave brings HP back, aside from that, a sweet attack!
* Poison Ball will bounce all round, and gas a hillside or the ground!
* The Healing Gen sounds like a hit! In the game, it's utter shit.

**Engineer**

* Heavy Turrets pew and shoot, while you take naps, and all the loot!
* Deployable Shields are lots of fun - they blast your motorbike into the sun!
* Supply pads make you lots of friends. The ammo dump just never ends!
* Claymores are back in the game. They sucked back then and are the same.
* Going to put a Charged Pulse in? Stick with turrets, and you win.

**Recon**

* SIN Beacons make bad guys glow blue. Shoot them and it hurts more too!
* Decoy gives you lots of room, to run in or out, and then - Kaboom!
* If your bolts don't Resonate, then slot this in, because it's great!
* Thumper hit, about to blow? Cryo bombs will make stuff slow.
* Proxy Response is rather rare, it's Repulsor Blast, but with a snare!

1371172933.0	1gb59g	many thanks to the devs team	alanegrudere	8	2	7	"i'd just want to start with the game isn't perfect, but i has a great potential. i've been following it for like 2 years now, and i've been playing it for like 1 year maybe 2, dont know for sure. it has some lag some time and stuff like that, but when it works i'd like to say its like all i can ask from a game so far. you can tell the game is made by gamers. the best part is that they know what you want from it and they deliver. so far the nav wheel is the best thing i've seen. yeah u can ask for hotbars and stuff like that. but will only get in the way, and they've already thought for simpler ways to get it faster so the calldowns or w/e can be switched by [ or ] keys. the ui from what i've seen so far it's the friendliest. u just have to take a look into it and customise it yourself or learn how to do some tricks. btw many of the addons i've seen are actually some ui features no one cared to look into them. and don't get me started on the gamepad suport. so far firefall it's the only game u can start your gamepad after u turn on the game. with other games if u turn the game on first and then the gamepad the game doesn't detect it so u have to close the game and restart it so the gamepad can run properly. (i use a 360 controller, didn't tried my no brand controller so far, but still no other game has this feature that i know of). and the nav wheel feature goes so well with the gamepad. maybe some twitches here and there and u can play without any trouble. my advice to u all is look the game up. look the ui up. and make it own. you can tailor it for yourself and what you need. 
anyways. the devs are listening to what u have to say from what i've seen so far. btw. the beta resources turned into beta crystite and then buying an lgv or tex or gliderpads is the best way to make me feel like the game is thanking me for playing the game in the beta. i feel appreciated. if they get rid of the lag and stuff, i see a great future for this game. 
and for the devs team. 10x man! for a f2p game, they go the extra mile and in the long run i think this will pay up. so far, all my requests about the game that i've submited a bug report are ok. i've asked for a much better way to see my xp in the skill tree, cuz the last       skill tree had some red on black colors and i'm color blind so it was difficult for me to see what was the amount of xp needed, and they've change it. don't know if it was for me or some other dudes that are color blind, or they had their own agenda but did it. and yeah u can say it's common sense but i've submitted this to other games in beta state and they didn't do jack about it. 
so bottom line is: look it up. try to get the best out of the ui. and if u have some problems or things that u need to be changed submit a bug report or go to the forums or w/e. and as far as red5 goes. 10x guys for doing a great job. keep up the good work. 
btw. what are u thankful for about firefall? (i'm really curious what are the other things that  u like about it) 


tl:dr 
10x red5 for the game. check the ui before u play the game and nice work with the gamepad suport."	t5_2s629	True

Kryyss	6	1	1	"For some time now the changes to the resource systems have made maintaining the Live Feed especially difficult. Time which could have been better spent on adding new content was being spent attempting to keep the numbers as up-to-date as possible. This proved to be a monumental task as the new resource system could add a new resource within a single 24 hour period if players were over-mining it. So a solution was needed. 

At the time we did not have anyone working on the RAWR team who had the technical knowledge to allow us to create a tool similar to Scanhammer.info but thanks to extremely hard work by Dark Cisum and Hanachi we are happy to announce that the Live Feed is now being pulled directly from the servers with the help of RAWR Corps members."	t5_2s629	True

There is already a LOT of variation in resources out there and constantly playing PvP can put you at a disadvantage at building up your PvE frames since you won't be doing a lot of thumping.


I will flesh this more out later... but it seems like something that would benefit the PvP community, as well as any casuals. Hell, you could even make it so the resource distributed is the newest one in the resource cycle.

1355952399.0	154ohc	New Patch Impressions	Esham	6	2	5	"So i got some time last night to play with the new patch.  As a background i have Recluse, Tigerclaw, Electron, Nighthawk and Rhino unlocked.  

I decided to play on my Rhino as  Dreads got a little love in this patch.

Right off the bat i noticed the majority of the map was blue.  Having read the forums enough i had a feeling this would be the case.  With longer lockouts on towers and less pods it really felt like there wasn't much to do.  When a tower did get taken over there was atleast 5 people there to take it back or we would wait for the 5min lockout to end.

Imo i think reducing the drop pod frequency PLUS the longer lockout was a bit too much in regards to content to play.  

Since the map was mostly clear i decided i had better go thump.  Right away i noticed that a new mineral rotation had kicked in.  I actually found some blue silicate (cy-650 or so) which was amazing.  Had a small group of 3 folks improved thumper it a bunch but i haven't played with the material yet.  If past experiences hold true this mineral will be the rare blue mineral of choice for this rotation (last mineral being blue bismuth and coralite).  

A note that was not included in the patch notes was that the thump dump printer is up and running now.  This change i loved as i felt going north was very beneficial but the trek back to copa was always a pain to reload my prints.  This saved a tonne of time as i could bang out a new thumper that i lost with little downtime. 

One thing i forgot to do right off the bat was outfit the hell out of my max constraint gear.  My tigerclaw shot up in power (not really needed imo) as i could put on my best ammo and a 3rd skill without any limitations.  Icing on the cake that is already 3 tiers higher than all the other classes imo.

My recluse got similar treatment but, like the assault, the class never had any issues.

Onto my Dread.  More damage, larger clip.  Awesome and awesome.  With my ammo and the bonus i sit at 360 shots in the clip.  I can now activate Explosive rounds and get the full effect without having to reload.  My loadout is explosive rounds, heavy armor and either gravity well or repulsor blast.  I quickly realized that chosen have become less of a threat so i didn't really need gravity well for its defensive capabilities anymore.  

Pods and towers were a blast when they were available.  I could walk right into the middle of a pod of chosen and pop heavy armor and go to town.  I am starting to get the timing right though as you need to get everyones attention before activating heavy armor or it doesn't really do much.  But flying in with HMG a blazing and coming out at near full health was so satisfying.  With heavy armor to start and explosive rounds to finish it just worked great.  But the class is still behind in viability.  What feels good on dread feels stupid on other classes. 

All in all i have enjoyed the patch greatly so far.  i wish there was more to do but that will come with time.  Dread feels good but every other class is completely OP now.  Although my dread isn;t fully unlocked so i suspect it will get into the OP territory but not as crazy as say the assault or biotech.

Also, the graphics give me a subtle kick of nostalgia to the days of Jak and Daxter.  Question tho, how much difference does gear stats affect game play?  Is it to the degree where the better gun put in the hands of a non-blind kid can hit just enough shots to beat a more skilled player with less dmg per shot with more accuracy / dodges?  and who has an extra beta key :D 	t5_2s629	True

There is a console command (ui_alpha 0) to remove the HUD, but I can't seem to find a command to remove the viewmodel. I'm hoping Red 5 will consider adding this command because I think there is a lot of potential in using Firefall to make machinima. 	t5_2s629	True

1346408011.0	z4n2z	[Rumor] Guestimated updates set for September 24th	zVulture	6	2	18	"So one of the things the [Founder's pack](http://beta.firefallthegame.com/founders) has done is hinted at what is going to be updated in September 24th:

&gt;Army name reservations, personal tiki masks, tiki mask gifts, and other virtual items will unlock September 24th.

If I follow logic here, this should be a decent content patch with:  
* Light Ground Vehicles for all players (special skins for Founders)  
* Rough Army System implemented (so they have a database in-game to reserve army names)  
* A new wave of Cash Shop items (including possible price adjustments)  
* New 'Decorations' for battleframes added to the new you stations (currently only the Founder's insignias)
* A gift system (if not a full trade system)  

~~We also have the video's that have been popping up with new critters so...~~  
Update: These two are programed in-game but no release date has been made for them (estimated PvE Milestone)  
* [Brontodons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XoHFg-a7DA) added to game  
* (Currently un-named) - [The Stuff of Nightmares](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oLA-GAW8LE) added to game

~~Going out on a stretch if it's the PvE milestone, but guessing it's too soon for this stuff:~~  
Update: Sept. 24th update confirmed for just Founder items.  As they say 'soon'  
* Army content added  
* Army Events added (pushing back the melding or larger thumpers)  
* Relay Towers Improved (fixed so we can actually activate w/o problems)  
* More/larger chosen events (city invasion? really stretching here)  

As someone who doesn't frequent the forums, there might be other hints of updates for this set.  All of this is my own conjecture but I thought it was amusing enough to share."	t5_2s629	True
1345671385.0	ynrr3	Biggest Annoyance - T2 Fit limitations	zVulture	8	2	17	"So I recently got more into making a few T2 setups.  Crafting out some amazing items I soon found I was running out of Power (electricity? not in game at the moment).  I find this to be an OK limit to what can be equiped so I looked at my options for fitting.  I found that there was no way to have a T2 improved module (aka + this - 2 other things) be at least neutral (+1 thing 0 other two things) without needing More power than the base module it's made from.  This pushes me to use the non-modified abilities so I don't get the drawbacks.

There are a few options to adjust for this.  The most basic is to allow some of the modules from T1 to cross over.  They cost the same as the ones with drawbacks but only help that stat at a reduced value (50%? 75% of the value?).  This leaves for a broader choice of what players can equip without going over the limited resources.  Also, this gives the T2 a bit more power at the start as it caries over the T1 modules (though possibly at a % penalty to adjust for Tech differences?)."	t5_2s629	True

There seems to be no reason for it to not work. Even when adding the .exe to steam, it refuses to even show me as in-game now, not to mention not giving me the overlay.

I think that we should set up a Reddit PvP Match about a week after the changes go live.  I say a week so that people can get their beta invites sorted out as well as get some playtime in on their battleframes.  Though maybe two weeks might be better?

Rules (gametype/map) and teams can be ironed out depending on the interest (people involved) as well as Day/Time that might work out for the most people.

1339060971.0	upjkb	LiveStream tonight (multiple key giveaways as well)!!	Solous	6	0	6	"**MOST IMPORTANT EDIT: It's not happening tonight! I wrote that as a place holder and forgot to change it. The stream is this Saturday**


Hello! I'm Solous, a representative of the Ragnarok Army. This Saturday at 4:00 pm EST, our glorious warriors will be hosting a LiveStream whilst playing Firefall. If you've tuned in before, you'll know that it lasts anywhere between 3 and 6 hours (we lose track). On top of live commentary, we feature a stream-long session of Q&amp;A. Just pop us a message in the stream chat and we'll try and answer it then and there!

The last major stream we had, we hosted a bunch of viewers and included them in the cast! They were involved in our Q&amp;A and were able to comment on our gameplay as well as ask questions for the benefit of all. Our army communicates through a program called RaidCall. You can find a download for the program [here](http://www.raidcall.com/download.php). Keep in mind that to use it, you'll have to [make an account](http://www.raidcall.com/signup.php).

If that wasn't enough, the members of Firefall will be providing an even better incentive! Our MC will sporadically and suddenly announce the giveaway of a handy-dandy Beta Key! All you've got to do is complete whatever task is assigned before anyone else; Remember, it's not a first-come first-serve system, but a contest! Previous challenges have been Firefall-related trivia, short stories, and random number generators, so brush up on your game knowledge (except for the random number thing, no guarantees there).

**TL;DR**

Who: Ragnarok (We're an army in Firefall with membership all over the world!)

What: A LiveStream of awesome proportions! Tune in for a chance to win one of several beta keys (the actual amount is still to be determined. Expect more than 8)!

When: 4:00 pm EST. Don't be late!

Where: [Our army's LiveStream channel](http://www.twitch.tv/ragnarokfirefall)!

Why: Because. That's why."	t5_2s629	True
