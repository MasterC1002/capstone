I remember getting the playstation 1 for Christmas. Crash Bandicoot was the only game I got that year but soon saved money to buy my own games later.

When NCAA 98 came out, my dad bought me the game. We played and well he kicked my ass every single game we played.

Fast forward, I am 26 years old, live two states away, family of my own and my dad sends me a text asking, ""When we go on vacation next month, do you want me to bring your playstation and NCAA 98?"" I told him to kiss my ass. I will never forget every time I see or hear the name Danny Wuerffel, I picture taking NCAA98 out of the case and getting ready for a stomping.

We have been bringing this with us to every vacation since I can remember. We save it for a rainy day at the beach or just too damn lazy to get out of the condo one day. I missed two family vacations while I was in the Marine Corps.

We have both pre-ordered the PS4 through amazon. Hopefully pass something as comical down to my son someday.

TL:DR Dad kicked my ass in NCAA98. Coming back to Play Station after 8 years. "	t5_2qh6b	True

I had PS+ so it turned out a great deal for me because it was $28 in the PSN store and was discounted 50% so I got it for $14. I checked gamestop and they have it for $40 on new and $38 on pre-owned.

But here's the thing: I only bought the one for PS3. But apparently, with that $14 purchase, I checked my available downloads and **also** got the PS Vita version?

So not only I got a huge savings on it, but I also got it for two consoles (PS3 and PS Vita)? Holy crap I didn't know buying through PSN was **this** good (and also mad good discount with PS+).

Was it always like this with PSN? If so, this makes me really want to have Vita now. (PS4+Vita bundle please Sony)...

...

Additional question though **regarding free games from PS+**: If my PS+ expired and I renewed it maybe a week or two after it expired, will I still have access to the PS+ free games I have previously purchased? I mean, will I still be able to redownload them again or will they be removed from my download list? If they are going to be removed, does this mean I have to keep renewing my subscription in order to keep them in my download list?"	t5_2qh6b	True

1373776209.0	1i9cer	IDEA: go offline - Little helps a lot!	Mastermrz	28	1	16	"Hey guys!

This is an idea that I hope you, the PlayStation community, can bring up to Sony to implement this. This is the easiest feature ever to be implemented and I have no idea why Sony didn't do it yet.

A very small feature that should be on PlayStation is the ability to go offline. A simple edition to the types of status you can put, a ""offline"" or ""invisible"" button should be added. 

Why you may ask? Why would anyone want to appear offline?
First, this is a feature Xbox has that helps its users and Sony wants to catch up with Microsoft so... Why not?

SECOND, and my personal reason, along with thousands of others, is privacy. You see, I have lots of friends (in real life) that have the PlayStation. In fact, almost all my friends list is all people i know in real life. While its nice to play with friends, we all have days that we just want to play by ourselves. For me, what happens is that I get a game invite since I appear on but I really don't feel like playing with him/her. Keep in mind that its not that I hate them, it's just I want to play by myself.

I'm forced to ignore or make an excuse saying that its not really me and I'm someone else using my console. It's not a good feeling overall. 

I would like to ask if Sony implements this feature onto the PS3, a simple software update can roll this out AND if for some reason they can't, it would be nice enough to add it to the upcoming PS4.

I hope this gets talked a lot and eventually get the eye of Sony to recognize and implement this.

Thank you and please feel free to post your comments and thoughts below! :D

EDIT July 15, 2013: 
I am not bashing Sony to do this or in anyway trying to show off that I'm some cool kid in real life. I'm bringing up an idea that should be easy to implement and helps users in the long run. Just want to clear this out."	t5_2qh6b	True

(PS support success)	Nikolai197	34	7	9	"Today I called PS tech support due to my console lagging on every game, even single players. They went through a few questions, ""is it getting hot?"", ""is it all games?"", ""does it always happen?"". Once he had an idea of the issue, he told me that one of the files may have corrupted and that it's a common issue. He then told me to tell the console to look for any corrupted files. You do this by holding the power button down. It'll beep once, then it'll do a double beep which then you release the power button and it'll bring you to a debug menu with the options. If you hold it too long, it will just turn the console off. One of the options was ""Rebuild File System"" in the debug menu, which will look for any corrupted files, and fix them. Once this had looked for them, found them, and replaced them, my games then worked flawlessly. This is just for anyone who has had this issue. The guy who was helping was extremely patient and kind, and he also was able to respond very quickly. Thank you Sony!

I had a PS2 a long time ago, but since then I've been on the 360 until I built my PC very recently. I've never followed what is happening on the Playstation side of things, so I've gotten pretty out of the loop. I've decided that I want to catch up on a lot of the great exclusives before the next generation comes out, but most cross platform titles I'd still rather have for the PC. Is it worth getting one so close to the end of it's life just for those few games, as good as they are?

 I know that certain models of the launch PS3 are backwards compatible with the PS2, is it worth finding one of those? Or is the newest ""super slim"" model the one I should go for? Which bundle do you recommend, and what must play games should I pick up?

Sorry if this has been asked before; I didn't see anything recent in a cursory search, but then Reddit's search isn't the best...


Edit: Just found [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/SONY-PS3-500GB-Assassins-Creed-3-System-Bundle-Retail/290938424209?pt=Video_Games&amp;hash=item43bd480b91), looks like a great deal, what do you think?

Cheaper than Amazon, old slim which I think I like better (the sliding top seems *really* easy to break to me), and a good game that I'll definitely buy anyway. I might go with this one assuming there isn't something wrong with that model.

1375472425.0	1jl0u5	Playstation 2 advice needed: Should I buy a new system?	greenbraids	16	4	4	I have a PS2 slim that is at least 7 years old. I haven't played it in a year or so, but broke it out a few weeks ago with my preschooler to check out a few games: Katamari Damacy, Star Wars Lego, and the like. We haven't had any problems with my 'older' games, i.e. the ones I had originally--but when we try to play We Love Katamari Damacy or Lego Star Wars, the system will power down unexpectedly. This happens with both new and secondhand games, so I am assuming the problem is the console--do I need a new one, or is there anything else I could try first? I vaccuumed it out and made sure it had plenty of airflow, but that's all I could think of. Thanks, r/playstation!	t5_2qh6b	True
1375387366.0	1jim0h	Send in broken PS3 or buy a new one?	kayies	13	3	9	"Recently my PS3 began to suffer from the YLOD.  It's a PS3 slim and I've had it for about 4 years, so not really surprised there. My friend and I have already tried changing the thermal paste so I guess that wasn't the problem. I decided to talk to a Sony Representative about it and he said that I can send it in for $99, where they can fix it or send me another refurb, with a 90 day warranty. I've looked around and a new PS3 Super Slim bundle costs about $250 with a 250gb harddrive (couldn't find one that wasn't in a bundle). If I could find a stand alone new PS3 with a small harddrive, that costs less than the bundle costs, I was thinking of using my PS3 Slim's 250gb harddrive to replace the new ones'. 

So I'm wondering, should I send it in for $99 or play it safe and pay $250 for a brand new Super Slim? I'd really love to know what you guys think because I have no idea what to do.

Also, in the event that I simply have to make a new one in order to get rid of my old one, is there any way to transfer DLC to the new ID? My understanding is that you can transfer save game info, but I saw nothing about DLC. If I have to re-purchase DLC just to use it on a new PSN ID then I'll just wait until PS4 comes out I suppose.

The level selection screen was like a solar system with planets getting progressively bigger or smaller. (I don't remember which.)
Game 2 
The only thing I remember was that you were some kind of animal (not sure) that moved through realm like places and they all had missions that you had to accomplish to progress to the next one.

I sold my PlayStation 2 with a game or two years ago at a garage sale and I really regret it. 

I looked on eBay and it looks like I can pick up a used PS2 for between $30 and $60 plus shipping. I haven't looked to see how much the games are going for yet. The pros of buying a used system is being able to play the other PS2 games I kept(I used to own a backwards compatible PS3) and being able to buy other PS2 games if I felt like it. The con is it would be more expensive than just buying the downloadable ones.

The cost of buying the downloadable games from the PS store for my PS3 would be $10 each. The pros of buying the downloadable games are the cost and instant gratification. 

So whatcha think?

I have several (or 7!) questions regarding to how the removable HDD process works for the PS3.

1. Does the mounting bracket you have to buy support 2.5 and 3.5"" drives?
2. Does the PS3 support HDD's over 7200rpm?
3. Are SSD's actually a bad choice due to the amount of (guessing) read/writing the Playstation does?
4. How would you transfer content from an existing PS3 HDD to a user-replaced HDD?
5. Once the HDD has PS3 specific content on it, can you hook it upto a PC and check out the contents on there?
6. How does the PS3 handle the HDD -&gt; PS3 connection? Is it like a SATA cable, or a sata output jack that plugs in at the bottom?
7. How big are game installs usually? (This would give me an idea of going SSD or HDD)

Many questions I know, but I would really appreciate answers as even though they are for the PS3, I could extrapolate on this feature for the PS4 and give me some insight on whether to replace the default 500GB HDD it comes with, with either a 250GB SSD or 1+TB Caviar Black HDD.

I am a huge Playstation fan.  I grew up playing the NES and SNES systems until I was about 10 and my family bought a Playstation, which I fell in love with.  To this day, it is still probably my favorite console.  When I was about 13 the PS2 launched and I fell deeper down the Playstation rabbit hole.  Around that time I started getting involved with computers and PC gaming, and I haven't looked back since.  A little while after I graduated high school the PS3 and XBOX 360 came out, and I passed them both up.

Now, with the announcement of the PS4, I am hooked again.  It's been a long time since I've been interested in console gaming, but I am ready to jump back in.

I am a bit confused however. There are several games that have me interested in getting a PS4; Watch Dogs, The Division, The Crew, Destiny.  What confuses me, is that a couple of those titles (Watch Dogs, Destiny), are coming to both PS3 and PS4.  How does that work?

In my day, we have never heard of such a thing.  Is it the same game with lowered graphics?  Could a PS3 and a PS4 user both play Destiny together?  These may seem like simple questions, but I have never heard of anything like this before.

I have very minimal experience with Playstation, and seeing all those 5, XII, VII, 9, part games can be pretty intimidating and would love to get some suggestions.

First, some previous experience. I loved Gran Turismo, played it on the PS1 religiously. Beat Valkyrie Profile, and played a bit of Front Mission and Tenchu. DBZ and Bloody Roar were my go-to fighter games.

And I think that's about it. Since moving to Xbox, I really missed playing any anime/mecha based game and endless RPGs that Sony always gets.

Definitely getting the newest GT. As for the premium games, I really want to get into Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, God of War, but I have no idea where to start.

Would also like some suggestion for some cheap and fun mindless button-mashing fighting games (not Dynasty Warrior type), maybe more like Dreamcast's Powerstone, some DBZ, SSB type. Also a bit curious about the motion controller. Any good games for it? Not talking about ping pong or tennis, more along the lines of the Wii's ""No More Heroes"". Other suggestions are definitely welcomed."	t5_2qh6b	True

There is one game I played when I was a kid that I really want to revisit but I can't remember the name. I'll try to explain the gameplay in as much detail as I can and maybe some of you have played it and can tell me what's the name.

So it was a fighting game but not a 1-on-1 fighter, you go through levers and fight waves of enemies, there were 4 characters to choose from - 2 chicks, 1 normal dude and one buff motherfucker, as far as I remember the buff dude is wearing a white tank-top. While playing you can pick up objects and throw them at enemies, you can roll around and dodge shit, I think you can also beat the shit out of a wending machine and drink the sodas that fall out to regain HP. The game can be played either in local co-op or alone. Also the camera is not from the side but also not from the top as in first GTA games, the view is very similar to games like Bastion. I think it's called top-down view? 

This is pretty much the max detail my brain can recall, does anybody know what game this is?"	t5_2qh6b	True

1362790975.0	19y38t	(help question, don't upvote) Ps2 having trouble with specific ps1 game?	BlackQuartz	11	2	2	I recently picked up final fantasy chronicles for the playstation 1 because I had heard good things about chrono trigger. I have a slim playstation 2 model. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is that the discs have reflective edges like a regular dvd or cd, while the other ps1 games I have have black discs, not sure if that matters. When I booted up the game it loaded fine, but the game would not take any input from the controller. Same thing happened with the other game in the collection, final fantasy 2/4. At first I thought it was a problem with my controller, but all my other ps2 and ps1 games work fine. I don't see this game on the unplayable ps1 games for ps2, so what gives? any help is appreciated. 	t5_2qh6b	True

One of the first generation PAL Units with PS2 backwards compatibility (albeit partially software based). So I figured ""shit, I got some catching up to do"".

So here's my rather meaty request. From PS1 right through to PS3, what are some must have ""exclusives""? I use exclusives loosely because included in that can be releases of games that include extra content from other platforms, games which otherwise appeared on arcade machines or more obscure consoles or ones which I simply don't have (I have SEGA Genesis, N64, Original Xbox, All GameBoys my PC and an Original Xbox) or releases which you feel are superior on the PS1/2/3 over their counterparts for whatever reason. Of course, I DEFINITELY put emphasis on games I simply can not get on other consoles, so actual true exclusives are the most appreciated addition.

Ok, not yet, but my fan got really loud today, which has never happened before. This week I decided to replay all 5 God of Wars before the new one is out (yes I realize it is a prequel) so I've been playing about 12 hours a day, which I have done plenty before, so it just may be its time to die.   I've had it for 5 years now, so of course it's out of warranty. 

My issue is this... God of War Ascension comes out Tuesday. My PS3 hasn't died yet, but I am worried it may die while playing GOW:A and I don't want it stuck in my PS3 and not be able to play it.

I have no problem buying a new PS3, but I upgraded my hard drive to a 500 Gb and I see none of the slims are that big, and if I just switch out the hard drive it will be reformatted and I wil lose all my data. 

So how do I do this? I need to back up the 500 bg I currently have, put it in the new PS3, then put all the data back on. No clue how to do that.

But I'm faced with a dilemma, buy the ps3 now or ps4 later. Here's my thoughts but I also want to hear yours.

PS3 - Pros

* Cheaper price
* Reliable hardware/software
* Good amount of games
* Lots of exclusives I haven't played

PS4 - Pros 

* New technology
* New games designed for next gen

PS4 - Cons

* Chance for glitches/buggy consoles


Either way I think I'll be happy with what I get, but I want some input from you guys and hear what you say. Also money is not the biggest issue here, I have enough money to buy either, both if I really wanted to.

Enough with the backstory. I came across a CECH-01 Model (40GB) for $120 that I couldn't pass up.

 

As I wait for it to arrive in the mail, I'm looking into what I should get for my new machine.

 

I was thinking the God of War Saga &amp; the Resistance Collection, but other than that, I'm not really sure.

 

I also need to pick up a controller &amp; a power cable as the eBay listing does not include one.

I've had GTA IV (Complete edition) for a pretty long time now and its probably y favorite PS3 game. Recently, like maybe a few months now, the game has been doing crazy things. So far, I have seen the game freeze after selecting GTA IV, the audio has crashed in the middle of playing-it just froze like taking a cartridge out of the gameboy, the game has stopped showing parts of the GUI and even stopped me from using controls properly- I couldn't shoot, take out the phone, etc.

So everyone, is this a version glitch? Do I need to update something? Or is my CD getting damaged?

Just today when I played, I had the GUI problems, so I cleaned the disc and put it back in... Now it completely freezes after I pick GTA IV and my playstation reset when I took out the disc.

First, the console is out of warranty. The Sony CSR that I spoke with told me it would be $99 to fix the system. Website shows they charge at least $50 for shipping and to actually look at the system without repairs. Is this correct?

For a while, I'd ""test connection"" and it would fail at ""IP Address"". I tried restarting my system, restoring former settings, turning my router on and off, trying different ethernet cables, tried unplugging ethernet and connecting via wifi (the scan shows my SSID but it's unable to connect), I've tried basically everything. 

What's weird, is now my ""test connection"" screen only displays [these](http://i.imgur.com/FGgXaMu.jpg?1) two fields, rather than the standard 10-ish (where it tests upload/download/psn/etc).

What's even weirder is that half the time it'll say ""failed"" on ""Obtain IP Address"", but if I run it ten seconds later it'll ""succeed"" in both fields. Then when I try to do something like sign in to PSN, it'll tell me ""a network connection could not be established"".

Anybody have any idea what's going on?

First of all, I bought my PS3 around January 2013. I know theres different types of PS3 models but I hope this information can tell you which one it is (i think its called the Slim Model?)
 
The PS3 connects to the internet via WiFI and is hooked up to my TV by an HDMI cable.
 
Ive never had an issue until Sunday (April 28, 2013) where it seems after I have turned off my PS3, the TV starts to not work. The first example came from my wall TV where when I try to turn it on, it fails and just shuts off. My dads friend did a factory reset to the TV which got it working... UNTIL i played with my PS3 and turned it off. 
 
I thought it was the TV at first but then I moved it my Flatscreen TV (which never had any problems, like my wall TV) and after playing with my PS3, the TV WOULD NOT TURN ON. I tried pressing the power button from the remote and the button on the physical TV but no game. I unplugged my PS3 and the TV and replugged my TV (but not the PS3) and... it worked!
 
My wall TV is still having problems failing to turn on and after this incident, im scared to play my PS3 on my flatscreen because im scared it will break it.
 
Ive never had any problems with this before or any device/console and this is the PS3 causing the problem as my new TV (the flatscreen) never had problems and always worked perfectly until I plugged my PS3 in.
 
Can anyone help me with this? I dont want a $250 black brick on my table. 
 
EDIT: Just more information to help after trying to find a solution (didnt find any yet)
-I bought mine the USA
-Im living in the USA
-My PS3 account is in the same region where I live in (USA)
-It has never been jailbroken or hacked before, I always download updates as soon as they come (to access PlayStation Network)
-Its not a used console, this is straight from Best Buy

Just want to say that THIS IS NOT A TROLL IN ANYWAY! IM BEING SUPER SERIOUS!

My TV problems started happening on Sunday as I said. My main TV (the wall TV) was the first one to hit this problem. I thought it was because my TV was getting old UNTIL i plugged my PS3 into my other TV (Flatscreen) and it started experiencing weird issues (such as not working correctly) so it has to be from my PS3
 
Here, if you want, ill describe my TV problems
 
First TV - Wall TV - Main TV

Never had anything like this before. What happens is that it powers on normally and usually the blank screen comes up (depending on what HDMI its on, usually blank if PS3 is off) but INSTEAD, it turns on but no blank screen, just still dark. After about 20 seconds, it powers off and a red light blinks on and off for a couple seconds
 
Second TV - FlatScreen

Again, never encountered this. I remember shutting my PS3 off and then goin to take a shower (didnt turn off the TV but no one couldve broken it as no one was in the house), i come downstairs and relax until my grandparents come home. They try turning on the TV and it doesnt power up. I get scared and try pushing the ""Power"" button, nothing. Unplugged the TV power and the PS3 from the TV and replugged the TV power (NOT THE PS3!) and... IT WORKED!

One day I got a $20 PSN card, but I had to be 18+ in able to register. In fact, I had to be 18+ to redeem any means of currency whats so ever, so I created a new PSN account with a lied age in able to buy Final Fantasy VII.

What's not fair is every other platform, even Xbox, allows users under 18 to redeem any amount of money into their accounts and make purchases themselves (with the exception of M-rated games). 

Having to hold an adults hand in able to buy ANY game or DLC is just ridiculous. But why not use their ID instead?

Imagine how many users lied their age in able to purchase with their PSN account. Some of the winners in the Uncharted 2 competition probably weren't at the minimum age.

It may sound like a rant, and don't get me wrong, I like PlayStation, but it's like having this paranoid parent who doesn't let you handle your own money, so all your purchases are made through that parent.

I'm not angry, this ""25 year-old"" is just a little annoyed because because his peers he met online have really high-pitch voices.

Just sayin.

I don't want to just let anyone mess with it, because I'd rather trust Sony than a friend of a friend who ""totally hacked his PS3 at home"", so I googled it to see and someone on a forum mentioned Sony will make any repairs to the system as long as the warranty sticker is intact.

1) It was cartoonyish.

2) It was on a beach area.

3) The beach had a lighthouse that you could enter at some point. The lighthouse interior was a level of it's own involving platform gameplay.

4) This may not be accurate, but I THINK that you could talk to people, sort of like a Zelda kind of feel.

5) Finally, I believe the characters (being a more family/kids game) were possibly animal based. Though I made be wrong on that one.

played my little heart out and had a jolly ol time with my battles.

fast forward late 2009 I ended up getting married, moved off post to some not so friendly area of town, well the thing gets stolen. 
With no real care I said fuck it and moved on with my life dealing with the sham of a wife I had.

so fast forward to now, no longer with the life sucking witch and in another state, after leaving the state and the military (house got broken into, pretty much loosing everything of value) with pretty much the clothes on my back and some other technology I have established myself quite well off, so much in fact im able to now start looking at getting a new ps3/ps4. 

I decide to hop on PSN and try to recover my account, however I can no longer remember my email associated. In addition I have no records of my SN for my old PS3.

so here I am stuck feeling like the only option is creating a new account, however my pride and history with my old account is getting the best of me at this point. 

so my question for you all is there any humanly way to recover my account without either source of information? 

1. yes this is legitimately my account

2. I have multiple records and identification

3. I am able to correctly answer all security related questions (obviously excluding the email &amp; S/N)

Reddit you are my only hope. If you can legitimately help me or point me in the right direction of backtracking my old email address or getting me access into the account I may be able to get you a pizza or some gold

You might have seen [this thing](http://i.imgur.com/UAYMhS9.jpg) on r/gaming a whiles back. I built this with a bunch of kids at a youth centre and Ive finally managed to ""Bring some work home with me"" by pulling the PS3 out of it and getting a PSN network card. So heres the deal...


I have $70 AUD for games and it looks like the games on PSN are not cheap. I have no network connection at work so I can not play anything that requires a network. This isn't negotiable.

Now I'm a bit further in the game and have access to the open world area, and have found that the Move either performs atrociously or not at all in this environment, yet it still works perfectly on story levels.

For instance, when fighting enemies, you need to perform a little gesture to finish them off if they're weak, and this always works flawlessly.  However, none of the side jobs in the overworld, which consist of the exact same gestures, register properly at all.

Examples:
Mowing the lawn.  Game says to tilt controller in the direction you want to turn, but no matter what I do, Travis spins wildly in a tight circle.
Semaphore flags.  Simple gesture commands that are exactly like the ones used to kill enemies, but it doesn't register at all.  I can flail my arms wildly and Travis just stands there motionless.

I have contacted PlayStation for help and their instructions did nothing. They kept thinking it was my systems fault but it plays all my other games just fine. I talked to people at Future Shop and they said it's a problem with the game. I went to return the game but was forced to get another copy, and guess what, same sound problems! that's 2 different copies! 

After doing some research I have found people who have a PS3 copy are having sound problems as well, problems such as: people talking over others, echoing, repeating, bad music quality, low voice volumes to know voice at all. Were as the Xbox seems to have no to little problems with the game.

If anyone else is having sound issues, please come forward and let WB and Grasshopper Manufacture know that they have to develop a patch for the game.  I'm sure this is something that can be fixed, but they need to be convinced that it is worth the effort.

If there is any fix that you have found to get around these issues, let me know!  I'm willing to try anything.

Honestly, this shoddy PlayStation port practice by Grasshopper is starting to drive me mad.  The PS2 port of Killer 7 was laggy, glitchy, and took forever to load between rooms.  No More Heroes was smoother on the Wii than on the PS3, and that's just crazy.  I love Grasshopper's games, but this is extremely frustrating!  Can anyone help me out?"	t5_2qh6b	True

Anyway, over the past few months, my PS3 has been acting really odd. Some games play flawlessly, but some games are really laggy despite the discs being in pristine condition and having worked perfectly in the past.

Media Express options: [3] http://imgur.com/CfFrX

End Result - When I set the Ps3 to component, I get a black screen, my monitor gives me a message saying ""Optimal resolution not set, 1920 x 1080"" and neither Media Express or Xsplit shows me a picture. I haven't tried all combinations of setings - thought I would post here first.

Second situation - I've tried it with the Wii. Only using the composite cables this time. (Red white yellow) and it has worked - it doesn't show up on my PC monitor though (HDMI out failing again (??) - but it shows up in media express. (I don't get sound, the levels show sound, but I hear nothing coming out of my speakers) When I add the camera in Xsplit, blank screen.

Could anyone help me troubleshoot this?

Some updates, because this is a cross post -  I fiddled with the settings some more, the BMIS can't take in 1080p at 60fps, so I'm stuck with 720p.    I got to a point where I can get the BMIS outputting to my computer monitor, but no sound is detected, and inside Media express, the capture window is black.

I don't play a lot of multiplayer games and when I do, I usually play them on PC (even though I primarily play everything else on PS3 and 360). I really want to play the GTA V multiplayer and I'll be buying it on PS3.
Because I don't really do any multiplayer gaming on PS3, I don't have a headset for it. I'm looking for the cheapest possible option.

I found this [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qWvjcJFMk) of a guy explaining how it's possible to use a USB adapter to use a standard mic and headphones. [I found one on ebay](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/USB-Headset-Headphone-Mic-Sound-Adapter-For-PS3-Slim-OZ-/110635219726?pt=AU_MobilePhoneAccessories&amp;hash=item19c25f7b0e&amp;_uhb=1) However I was a little concerned about how cheap it is ($4.27 or best offer) and how generic it looks. Has anybody used one of these before? Are they dodgy? Would the sound quality be okay? I'll be using a Zalman ZM-MIC-1 microphone and Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones (that is if I have to use headphones at all, I'd kind of prefer to output the sound of other players voices to my external speakers as I want to maintain surround sound, would this be possible or would I have to use headphones to hear other people talk?. I also found a [cheap Offical Singstar adapter](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Official-Sony-Singstar-USB-Adaptor-Converter-for-microphones-PS2-PS3-NEW-/181180989308?pt=UK_VideoGames_VideoGameAccessories_VideoGameAccessories_JN&amp;hash=item2a2f3a7f7c&amp;_uhb=1), would this work? If so, would I get better sound quality out of it given that it's an official Sony product?

After I downloaded and installed the 4.46 update (setting it to turn off once finished) but when it was done, instead of turning off, the screen went black and the console froze. Trying to turn it off just gave me the beeps, and since it was frozen, I had to pull the plug. When I turned it back on again, obviously it started the corrupted media reboot. Again, during this process the console shuts down once finished. But like before, it just froze. So I did the same thing again (insanity, I know) without success. This time though, I decided to try the ""emergency reboot"" feature or whatever it's called. (Holding the power button, wait for 3 beeps and repeat) Which brings you to the safe mode menu. I selected option 3 (restore file system). The screen said ""Preparing, please wait"" with a spinning loading symbol in the top right corner. I left to watch a football game, and got back, 2 hours later, to find it was stuck in the same process. It's been 3 hours now and it's still ""preparing"". It's not frozen, because the spinning ""loading"" icon is still spinning. 

Does anyone know what happened or how to fix it? Any help is appreciated. 

If it matters, I've never replaced my hard drive and I never installed the 4.45 update, in fear of bricking my console... ironic.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, but I'm having two issues with my PS3 (60GB CECHA01). The first is, I think, more related to my room's ventilation than anything else. When I first turn the PS3 on, the fans are at ""level 1,"" or nearly silent. They jump up to ""level 2"" after about five minutes idling on the XMB, and then to ""level 3"" when I load a game. After about half an hour of gameplay, they ramp up to ""level 4,"" and very occasionally to ""level 5,"" which is about as loud as a standard hair dryer. Is this normal fan behavior for a PS3, or should I look into clearing it out? My room is slightly warm - I'm getting a window unit soon - but it doesn't seem to trouble my desktop PC. Then again, I have a Silverstone Raven case, which has great airflow.

The second problem is more annoying. I've started getting random bursts of static, both visual and audible, from my PS3. It only lasts about a second, but it is frequent enough to disrupt the experience completely. It happens whether or not I'm going anything. I've tried plugging the PS3 directly into my monitor, instead of using my HDMI switch, but the problem persists. The strange thing is that I have been using this switch since I bought the system, and the problem has only cropped up within the last week or so.

I'd appreciate any advice on either of these issues.

My PS2 will read the first disc just fine, but with the second disc it only gets to the PS1 bios screen then freezes, and with the third disc it doesn't even get that far, just a black screen after the PS2 bios. I thought it might be because my discs were dirty, and the third disc had a really nasty concentric scratch, so I took them to a local game store to have them resurfaced. It's a really nice machine, cost them a few thousand bucks, so it's not like one of those stupid Disc Doctors. Anyway, my discs are spotless, so I'm pretty sure it's not them.

For further information, all three FFVII discs will read in the PS2, and with the FFIX discs I can see them listed when I go into the System Browser, and it says Playstation Game. So I really have no clue what's going on here. Most of the stuff I find online is for if the PS2 isn't reading PS1 discs at all, which isn't my issue.

last night I was playing a game and after a certain point the game began to lag horribly. I then saved my game and planned to turn it off to let it cool off but the save said it had failed. I then shut it down anyways without saving again. A couple of hours later, I started up the ps3 again to see if it was working better. It took a very long time for it to load to the play-station menu, and even longer once I was in the game.

After I was in the game I tried to load up the save game because it sowed a save file for the time that I had tried to save but it would not load (no surprise) and I then instead tried to load a previous save. It successfully loaded but the game would not progress past the in game loading screen. So I once agian shut the machine down and then tried to load it again. However, this time it would not even load to the play-station menu. I then did some troubleshooting online and decided to run through the options in the safe mode menu.

At this time I have run through all of the options with the last one being a system restore to factory settings. The machine will still not load and when I start it up all that happens is it will show the background waves but the menu options will not show up. I am then forced to hardboot it to turn it off.

1375293471.0	1jfoft	Which platform should I buy a game for if it's being released on both the PS3 and PS4?	Huystuhh	1	1	2	"So I'm having trouble deciding which console to go to for games that will be releasing on both.

On one hand, I'd like to get it on the PS4 since it'll be the newest generation so the games will most likely, for lack of a better word, stay fresher and not as outdated years from now. The PS4 is also a lot more powerful than the PS3 so in theory, the game should perform better.

But on the other hand, I feel like maybe the PS4 version of the game won't be as optimized to perform as well as it will on the PS3. I mean, developers have had a very long time to work out how to tell the PS3 what to do and how to do it. If you look at the first generation of Xbox/PS3 games, the don't even compare to what developers are able to coax out of the systems nowadays. So I feel like the game might not perform as well on the PS4 graphics and performance wise. At least not the launch-games if the developers started working on the games for the current gen before they knew about the new genand received a dev kit. In this scenario, the new gen would be receiving the port and the current gen would have the original, optimized version.

Firstly, the PS2 was my first ever console. Simply. Amazing. Then, back in 2008 I got the PS3. I would spend the next 2 years on that console. That was the console that made me into a ""hardcore gamer."" :) But, the interface was admittedly lacking. Then I invested in an Xbox 360. Exclusives me and my friends loved to play, and the most basic but fundamental, Party Chat. I got so engrossed in the community, that I not only played and thrived in the community, but I wanted to help it. So, just about a year ago I ""auditioned"" to become an Xbox Ambassador (Representative of gaming for Microsoft where you help, give support and advice, browse the forums, and I loved it. I loved helping someone and getting that ""Thank You"") just over a year ago. So, come May time, and Im getting excited. So much hype for the ""Xbox 720!"" Then that fateful day happened. I began to doubt. It looked bad. Really bad. Then they talked all about the Kinext and it's features. I felt... disappointed. I was left with a seemingly modern VCR. :( But I kept lying to myself trying to find its qualities. Then, I saw the PS4. Anyone here believe in love at first sight? It looked sleek, jagged, all around just better. But I didn't want to believe it. Then, E3 came around. After hearing about all the amazing exclusives, I. Was. Hooked! It was one of the hardest decisions Ive her had to make, but a few days ago I made my PSN account :) ""IKEELU1ST"" I'm back home.

If Sony were to release 2 controllers, one with the joystick and d-pad switched and the original setup, they would not only be more competitive but would have increased revenue from more sales. 

After all, how hard could it be to move some parts around on what already exists? Surely MS doesn't have a patent on joystick placement. 

Edit: And I'm sure people will mention there are 3rd party controllers - but let's be honest, these suck. However, it is further proof of how easy it would be to do. If some third-party can make custom controllers, why couldn't Sony just slightly edit their design for 2 controllers? "	t5_2qh6b	True

First a couple months back all of my regular DVD's started being unable to be read, Blu-ray's are fine but DVD's are just non existent in the PS3's eye's, well now, any game I play seem's to have screen tearing (Nino Kuni) or color flickers (Tomb Raider) or in the case of tomb raider or Assassins creed 3, there is a long bar that stretches from the character usally a weapon or the character itself and goes all the way up to the top of the screen, when I move the character it moves with it, changes positions.

Now i am not an expert on these kind of deals, because the games are kinda old now and i am not sure how much i should be asking for them. They are all in good shape, no scraches, box and manuals on them, everything is neat.
Thanks in advance guys

EDIT: if this is the wrong subreddit, please tell me where i should go. thank you!"	t5_2qh6b	True

I consulted my brother, and he told me to buy a new external hard drive, so I bought a 500GB Digistor PS3 hard drive. I moved all the saves over to it, but the same error still came up. I deleted a few of the game data utility slots, and that solved it, for now.
