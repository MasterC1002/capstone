We have thus taken the liberty of adding a few of them plus additional external resources to the FAQ. Feel free to add to it, o ye who can, and to mail the mods additional suggestions if you can't edit the wiki directly.

It follows from that that any thread posted to this sub that asks merely ""how do I get job"" will meet the same fate as any thread that asks merely ""what do i do in berlin"" or ""where do i find place live berlin"" — it will be summarily nuked without warning or explanation.

That may seem harsh, but our FAQ is really good, and the mission of /r/Berlin is primarily to serve people who want to talk about all aspects of the city and life in it, and we are very nearly flooded with tourist- and newcomer-info requests if we don't heavily moderate.

It remains perfectly acceptable to ask questions about employment, housing, or sightseeing in Berlin that have not been asked before or which bring something new to the discussion. These threads will be added to the FAQ. But for everything else, well, I'm over here sharpening my mod axe.

1357907434.0	16djwn	Thorva's Comprehensive Guide to Berlin Gay Bars	thorva	50	5	20	"Sup, everybody. In perusing the lovingly-maintained Berlin FAQ (check that sidebar!), I have noticed that there is no good listing of establishments specifically targeted toward and supported by the community of sex-with-the-same-sex-havers, so because I love you all so much and want to give back, have this comprehensive listing. Before we dive in, though, here's a preliminary matter:

**THORVA'S GAY-BAR INTENSITY SCALE™**

The purpose of this scale is so that you'll know, when looking at the listings, just what to expect from the environment at these places. This should prevent you from either wasting your time or accidentally bringing your straight female friends to a sex dungeon when what you had hoped to do was dance to Madonna.

&gt;**0** — Hilarious. Harmless. Camp. Maybe even pink. Plays good music. Your mother and her three friends would have a great time.
&gt;
&gt;**1** — Good music, good drinks, and suitable for a mixed crowd, but pretty decidedly gay, and later on at night, the sort of place where people are looking less for Mr Right and more for Mr Right Now. Your mother and her three friends would go with you if you asked, but they might wonder why they were there.
&gt;
&gt;**2** — A bar with a clearly segregated back room or basement where on-premises sexual activity is tolerated or encouraged. May also play Madonna, but that's not why you're there. At 2 and above, most places have porn playing on the TVs, but are also definitely bars: it's very easy to hang out with friends and drink. Do not bring your mother or her three friends.
&gt;
&gt;**3** — Basically a sex venue with beer taps. You may have to politely squeeze past someone wearing nothing but a harness to get to the bar. When you first came out to them, this is the sort of place that your mother and her three friends tearfully imagined you spending all of your time.

**AND NOW FOR THE LIST!** (Updated 12 Jan 2013)

***Mitte/Prenzlauer Berg***

* **Sharon Stonewall Inn** — Kleine Präsidentenstraße 3 (S Hackescher Markt/U Weinmeisterstraße). Small, loud, fun, and Anglo-friendly. Conforms to the very widely understood idea of a gay bar. Hosts ""Queer Beer Thursdays"" on the eponymous day of the week, an event geared toward English speakers (h/t blcknight). This one's a **0**.

* **Chantal's House of Shame** — at Bassy, Schönhauser Allee 176a (U Senefelder Platz). Not a bar, but I couldn't bear not to include it. This Thursdays-only dance event/surrealist quasi-drag show might be the best thing about being gay in Berlin. Gets very hookupy, sometimes even in the bathroom, but still a borderline **1**.

***Kreuzberg/Neukölln***

* **Roses** — Oranienstraße 187 (U Kottbusser Tor/U Görlitzer Bahnhof). Come for the furry pink walls, stay for the blinking Virgin Mary. Seriously rammed full of people at all times of the week. Probably the most spectacular place to bring open-minded hetero friends. The archetypal **0**.
* **Möbel Olfe** — (U Kottbusser Tor). Scruffy Kreuzberg gayish at all times, but if you like your dudes hipster-beardy, Thursday nights at this place are your idea of paradise. Too full and too serious-business to appeal to the straights, probably, so a **1**.
* **Schwuz/Café Melitta Sundström** — Mehringdamm 61 (U Mehringdamm). A venerable club with a long history (Schwuz) that tends young-ish. Out front, it's a really rather decent bar. Both safely rated **0**.
* **Ficken 3000** — Urbanstraße 70 (U Hermannplatz). Der Name ist Programm (or was it 'Nomen est Omen'?). Stepping into this place is like stepping into a time warp back to gay bars in 1979, which is also when most of the porn appearing on the TV screens seems to have been filmed. Hosts the popular-with-21-year-olds-from-Brooklyn ""Pork Party"" on Sundays. Slap and tickle strictly confined to the basement, so a **2**.
* **Barbie Deinhoff's** — Schlesische Straße 16 (U Schlesisches Tor). Wildly various genders, orientations, nationalities, languages, and fashion sense. Cool place, though, and a bit of an anchor of this happnin' corner of Kreuzberg. Also very Anglo-friendly and a definite fun **0**.
* **Südblock** — Admiralstraße 1 (U Kottbusser Tor). Also more club than bar, but definitely worth a visit. Teh gayz predictably Kreuzberg-looking. Open till God knows when, but only on irregular nights, so check ResidentAdvisor or similar to find out what's going on there. Probably a **1**, though that's less relevant when everyone is just dancing.
* **Silver Future** — Weserstraße 206 (U Hermannplatz). Loud, proud bar with an agenda. Sign behind the counter says it all: YOU ARE LEAVING THE HETERONORMATIVE SECTOR. Previous site of at least one /r/Berlin meetup, and nobody died of shock: **0**.

***Schöneberg***

* **Tom's** — Motzstraße 19 (U Nollendorfplatz). One of those institutional Schöneberg gay bars that appears to be more talked about than actually frequented by anyone, but give it a try if you're new here and getting your scene-bearings. It's a **2**.
* **Woof** — Fuggerstraße (yes, really) 37 (U Wittenbergplatz). A bar for bears. Rawr! As with most things Schöneberg-gay, tends older than Kreuzberg analogues. I leave it to you to decide whether this is a bug or a feature. Also a **2**.
* **Hafen** — Motzstraße 19 next to Tom's (U Nollendorfplatz). In my opinion the coolest and most civilized of the Schöneberg homo-joints. Also stands out for Anglo-friendliness. On balance, though, probably a **1**.
* **Heile Welt** — Motzstraße 5 (U Nollendorfplatz). In which I discover that I actually prefer furry pink walls to furry brown ones. This place is a little too airbrushed, hairbleached, and attitudey for me, but I'm already like 78 in MTV years, so your mileage may vary. At any rate, it is *the classic* Schöneberg cocktail-hole, a **1**.
* **Bull** — Kleiststrasse 35 (U Nollendorfplatz). If you want to have sex with a man in an Erwin-Rommel-style full-length leather coat or grope your way through an opaque cloud of cigarette smoke to the bathroom where volunteers offer themselves to be used as human urinals, well then, as the Village People said, 'young man, there's a place you can go.' Gets ""good"" about 6am. Although you technically have to walk past the bar to get to the sex instead of vice-versa, there's no way this is anything less than a **3**. (h/t Muridae)


***Friedrichshain***

* **Zum schmutzigen Hobby** — Revaler Straße 99 (S+U Warschauer Straße). Salon of illustrious drag-empress Nina Queer. Best enjoyed in summer for the open-air vibe, but lustig at all times. Suitable for mixed company: **0**.
* **Monster Ronson's Ichiban Karaoke** — Warschauer Straße 34 (S+U Warschauer Straße). AND I NEED YOU NOW TONIGHT / AND I NEED YOU MORE THAN EVERRR / AND IF YOU ONLY HOLD ME TIGHT / WE'LL BE HOOOLDIN OOONNN FOREEEVERRR. On the scale up to 3 for intensity and to 10 for my singing: **0**
* **lab.oratory** — Rudersdorfer Straße 70, in the basement of Berghain (S+U Warschauer Straße/S Ostbahnhof/U Weberwiese). *The* Berlin sex dungeon *schlechthin*. There are butchers who've never seen this much flesh in one place. Theme nights range from the obvious (""naked"") to the taste-specific (""office slut""), and check the website 'cause they're strict about them. Somewhere, buried deep in the Hieronymous-Bosch-like sexscape, is a man serving drinks. **3** or worse.
* **Große Freiheit** — Boxhagener Straße 114 (S+U Warschauer Straße/U Frankfurter Tor). The local den of iniquity; the Schöneberg embassy. Got some bad publicity last year when a dude got murdered there, but I'm sure that doesn't happen every weekend. Right? **2**.


I'd love to add to this list! Suggestions in the comments, please, and help me out with rating them on the scale, because even I, homosexual socialite that I am, have not been to all the gay bars in Berlin.

1359381838.0	17ffgn	Japanese Restaurants in Berlin	boywithumbrella	50	9	48	"Greetings, fellow redditors! I thought I'd consolidate and publish here my recommendations on Japanese food places in Berlin. 

I study Japan Studies and as such authentic Japanese food (as opposed to generic ""asian"" stuff) is relevant to my interests. Here I will present you with a short list of places where Japan-affiliated people in Berlin go. 

* **Daitokai**

*Japanese food/general, Sushi, Teppan-yaki*

Tauentzienstr. 9-12 (inside Europa-Center) 
10789 Berlin-Mitte, [fugly website](http://www.daitokai.de/)

Japanese owner, Japanese cook, to my knowledge Japanese service as well (only been there once). 

Daitokai is a fancy place with high prices and consequently high quality food and service. This would be a place for an official dinner, a date etc. Count on at least €30/person + beverage. 

* **Sasaya**

*Japanese food/general, Sushi*

Lychenerstr. 50,
10437 Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg, [website](http://sasaya-berlin.de/)

Japanese owner, Japanese cooks, Japanese service. 

Main thing to mention about Sasaya is that it has a Japanese-style area with soft flooring and low tables, where you sit on the floor while eating, which adds to the atmosphere. Western seating available as well. 

Good food, moderate prices. The place to go with friends or a date. Count on €15~20/person + alcohol. 

Open only 5 days a week, usually full - book several weeks in advance. 

* **Ishin-Tey**

*Japanese food/general, Sushi*

Hardenbergstraße 19
10623 Berlin-Charlottenburg, 
[website](http://www.ishin.de/) NOTE: Ishin-tey is not (yet) listed under ""restaurants"", only on the homepage. 

Japanese cook, Japanese service. 

Ishin-tey is part of the Ishin-chain which has 4 other locations in Berlin. This particular location next to the Zoo station is smaller and generally more fancy-looking, as well as having exclusively Japanese(-speaking) service, whereas others are more mainstream/fastfood. Usually fairly empty - good for spontaneous walk-in. 

Good selection of sushi and other Japanese dishes, very moderate prices. Count on about €20/person including drinks. 

* **Cocolo**

*Ramen, Gyoza*

Gipsstr. 3
10119 Berlin-Mitte, no website

Japanese owner, Japanese cooks/service

Cocolo is a ""ramen-ya"", which is a soup-shop. So basically it's a bar-like arrangement and the main dish is ramen - of which Cocolo offers about a dozen different kinds. There are some other snacks - such as Gyoza - available as well. By its nature a ramen-ya is usually the opposite of ""fancy"". ""Quick and dirty"" would be the stereotype, which is not to say that your food is served and consumed in unsanitary conditions, but Cocolo - much as Makoto ^(below) - is not the place for dinner. The atmosphere is dim, crowded and well suited for companies of young people. 

Prices are moderate to high (for ramen). Count on €10-15/person + alcohol. 

* **Makoto**

*Ramen, Donburi, Gyoza*

Alte Schönhauser Str. 13, 10119 Berlin-Mitte, [website](http://www.makoto-berlin.de/)

Japanese owner, Japanese cook

Makoto looks more fancy than Cocolo, but generally the same notice about the atmosphere of a ramen-ya applies to it. The sortiment of non-ramen food is broader in Makoto than Cocolo. Again, going out with young(-feeling) friends, or to try and break away from the sushi-stereotype. 

Prices are moderate to high (for ramen). Count on €10-15/person + alcohol.

So, Global Reddit Meetup Day is on the 15th of June this year. We are doing a meetup in Görli!  

**Place:** Görlitzerpark, in Kreuzberg. 
**Time:** 13:30
**Date:** 15th June, aka this Saturday

[Here is a map](http://i.imgur.com/rGlb7e5.png) of the location where we'll aim to be at. I was just there yesterday and this is a nice area with some trees for shade and space to grill. 
I always love a picnic and its cheap, aka BYOB and BYOF. The way I've organized meetups like this before is to give everyone something to bring apart from whatever to drink, saves us from eating a million bratwursts. Of course, multiple people can bring the same category of item because we'll likely need more than one packet of chips and one brötchen. :)  

Also, since its a picnic it would be nice if someone could bring a blanket or spread, aka something to sit on. 

- Grill(s): 
- Bratwurst/Sausage:  
- Hamburger meat: **discohead**
- Brötchen/Hot dog buns/hamburger buns: **discohead**
- Chicken/chicken wings/anything that isn't sausage or hamburger and goes on the grill: **eu_or_aus** 
- Chips: 
- Frisbee etc: **Pannonica1917** (badminton), **benlew** (slackline) 
- Dessert/Pie/whatever: **open** 

Also, in parallel with the BBQ/picnic planning, let's propose a bar or restaurant we can meet at if it rains that day, keeping in mind the weather we've been having.

1349605548.0	113002	Protip - For every student in Berlin who is desperately looking for a room	Michirox	48	14	32	"If you are fed up searching for flats on the common websites like:

* [wg-gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de) or
* [wohngemeinschaft.de](http://www.wohngemeinschaft.de)

then **congrats!** you find yourself in the same shitty situation I was in last year. I was eager to find a room in Berlin but coldn't find anything, the demand was always too high. So I decided to turn the tables and this is what I can recommend because it worked:

There is a project initiated by the Arwobau (I think one of Berlins largest renting companies) called [Easy Living](http://www.easy-living4u.de/index.php?id=2&amp;L=1). They have apartments (Single or WG apartments) just for students and offer those for a very very low rent.

So here is what I did. I called easy living and asked if there are any apartments available. After the positive answer I just posted some pictures of the apartment on wg-gesucht and described the apartment according to the description on the website. I led the people apply for the second room (I choose WG because you pay less for a WG as for a single apartment). I got many mails but choose the best ones.

So here Iam one year later I have my flat mate we pay 240€ each for a 80 square meter apartment including water, electricity and a big balcony. You will find those kind of opportunities nowhere else in Berlin (to my experience).

And it would be cool if other redditors would move here (Lichtenberg/Rhinstraße). The tram is just 1 minute away and you need just 15-20 minutes to the heart of Berlin. Also we have a free tennis/volleyball/basketball court with a little park just infront of the building :)

Hope I could help! 
Also, feel free to pm me if there are further questions."	t5_2qt49	True

AlexTheRat	38	5	16	"Recently I've been searching for a flat on WG-Gesucht. In addition to contacting people with room offers I also posted a request for myself. I received an e-mail from a man who claimed to be a dance instructor who had just moved to UK and had an apartment to offer. The name he gave me came up on google with plenty of info supporting his story. His apartment sounded great, but hardly so good as to arouse suspicion on my part.

Of course I was cautious at first, but we corresponded at length by e-mail and then even spoke on skype, albeit without video as he claimed not to have a webcam. He was very patient about asking me for money, making it seem almost like an afterthought to finding somebody who could care for his apartment. He mentioned that I would have to wire him money before arrival, but he didn't give me his bank information until after he had sent a me a fake, albeit extremely convincing, contract.

Then he gave me the contact info for a woman whom he claimed was already living in the other room of the apartment. I found her on facebook and we spoke briefly about life and ourselves. She seemed genuinely friendly, putting me even further at ease and I felt secure that the apartment existed and the people I was dealing with were who they claimed to be.

Then about a day after friending this woman on facebook, I received a message from a woman saying that the whole apartment deal was a scam. She had sent money to this man just a week earlier, then was surprised when he asked her to send him additional money. When she told him she wouldn't pay anything more until she moved into the apartment, he acted offended and furious, then broke off all contact. She then contacted the REAL person whom this man was impersonating and discovered that he knew nothing about any apartment. However, she was still facebook friends with the woman who claimed to be the current tenant and has been watching her feed to message new friends warning them about this scam.

Since then I have been able to spot several irregularities. All of the information I was provided could have been available online. In addition, this ""current tenant"" has an oddly low number of facebook friends from all parts of the world... except Germany where she supposedly lives. I assume they are all past or future marks. I just wanted to get word out that these scams can be EXTREMELY elaborate and convincing. Don't pay anyone without talking to them face-to-face and getting virtual tour of the apartment, even if you feel like you're inconveniencing them. The ones who are trying to take advantage of you aren't as obvious as you might think... certainly not as much as I believed.

TL;DR Was contacted by somebody who saw my request on WG-Gesucht. He/she impersonated a real person very convincingly over skype and e-mail, and also had an accomplice on facebook. I may have fallen for it if not contacted by previous victim of scam/internet hero!"	t5_2qt49	True
1335867089.0	t1c9k	3rd annual Global Reddit meetup day: June 23rd! 	lgspeck	37	5	112	"Hey guys! As you all might have seen in the frontpage, there is going to be a Global Reddit meetup day again. The date is set for June 23rd. 

I am expecting a lot of different people, with different interests and different suggestions on what we should do on that day. 

So I suggest a good ol' barbecue in the park (Tempelhofer Feld?). Because: who doesn't like Barbecue.

Each person could bring something to eat (meat, salads, vegetarian stuff, chips, drinks, beer...), whoever has a grill could bring it (we would need about a grill per 4-6 people). What do you guys think?

I am excited to meet you all! 



**EDIT June 15th**: Hey guys! One week left, I am just going to post the important information for those new to the thread:

Barbecue at Tempehofer Feld. Bring stuff to eat/drink/grill. 

When: June 23rd, 2 PM with an open end. 

Where: 52.469854,13.394156 (Put it on Google Maps with the satellite option on)

Who can come: Anyone. 

Specific tasks:

tin_dog volunteered to bring plastic cups, paper plates and a 50 cm grill (could you PM me to confirm?)

I am going to bring a 40 cm grill, plastic forks/knives and napkins

Don't forget your cameras/sunscreen/hats

Unfortunately, there is a 60% chance of rain, which doesn't mean much, that's the standard chance in the summer in berlin. But we should have a plan B. Suggestions?

Hope to see you all there!

**Weather update**: 20% chance of rain!

I've been here since March, and I've never had a problem like this until now. I've actually never had a situation like this in my life.

Last night, at around 3 in the morning, I was returning from the clubs and I got off at S-Schöneweide to get on a bus. Though, as I was waiting some younger-looking kid approaches me, 3 of his friends are in the background.

My German is really shit, so I thought he was asking me for a lighter for his cigarette. After a while, he started to say ""geld oder handy"" and getting up in my face. He made it clear he would fight me if I didn't do either. I don't know if he had a weapon or not.

There wasn't really anyone around except a frail looking woman on the bus bench.

I didn't feel super threatened by him individually, as he didn't look super strong, but he had friends maybe 20 meters away. I eventually gave him my money, 40 euros... I feel like an idiot, maybe there was some way I could have gotten out the situation with everything in tact.

Not only that, but I don't think I was doing anything super stupid. I wasn't wearing a suit or anything that suggested I had a lot of money. Just shorts and a t-shirt.

So now, I feel really strange. I'm only here for another two and a half weeks, staying at my friends place near said train station. Should I just avoid returning home when it's dark out? Should I accept that I just had bad luck and finish my 2 weeks here as normal? Do such things happen very often?"	t5_2qt49	True

While we are two American women, we are wary travelers. I'm from New York, she lived in Harlem for quite a while, she has lived in Berlin for quite some time and is fluent in German.

When I say 15 I'm just guessing. They may have been younger. Two had particular baby faces, and one looked to be about 17. They were quite short, so I really wasn't immediately concerned. We just increased our pace. I'm very tall and have a second degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, so I've never been concerned about being mugged or beat up.

This is really more of a PSA to everyone. So I apologize for my rambling. Please be safe, travel in groups; even with two very in shape, martial arts trained women we were unable to fight them off; and stay away from Böcklerpark at night.

As a side note: German police were amazing. I've never dealt with them before and I can say that although the whole ordeal left me quite shaken, I feel much safer knowing that men and women like them are out there.

**Berlin an einem Tag:**

**Bitte lest den Guide mindestens einmal komplett durch, bevor ihr die Tour macht!**

Start: [Berlin Zoologischer Garten](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Berlin_Bahnhof_Zoo_Zoologischer_Garten_2007.jpg)
[Standortplan](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/de/binaries/asset/download/475104/file/1-1)

Geht über die Ampel (auf der anderen Seite ist unter anderem ein McDonalds zu sehen) und folgt der Straße Richtung 
[Gedächtniskirche.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged%C3%A4chtniskirche-2007_retouched.jpg)

1) [Die Gedächtniskirche](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ged%C3%A4chtniskirche1.JPG)
[Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ged%C3%A4chtniskirche_%28Berlin%29)

Die noch erhaltene Vorhalle der Gedächtniskirche wird von den Berlinern liebevoll der ""hohle Zahn"" genannt, während das achteckige Kirchenschiff und der neue Glockenturm unter dem den Namen ""Lippenstift"" und ""Puderdose"" bekannt sind. Der ""hohle Zahn"" kann eintrittfrei besichtigt werden. In ihm befindet sich unter anderem ein Model von der Gedächtniskirche und dem Breitscheidplatz, wie diese vor dem 2. Weltkrieg aussahen.

2) [Das Europa-Center](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Europa_Centre_200807.jpg)
[Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa-Center)

Im Europa-Center befindet sich unter anderem eine [Wasseruhr](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Berlin_Europa_Center_Wasseruhr.jpg), wenn es kurz vor einer vollen Stunde ist, könnt ihr Euch das spektakel ansehen. Habt ihr noch über eine Viertelstunde Zeit, nutzt sie, um Euch etwas umzusehen. Den Shopping-Verückten rate ich sich zusammen zunehmen und bis zum Ende der Tour (Alexanderplatz) zu warten.

Außerhalb des Europa-Centers (an der Ecke wo das Kentucky Fried Chicken ist) befindet sich eine Bushaltestelle. Nehmt den [Bus 100](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/de/binaries/asset/download/22168/file/1-1) Richtung Alexanderplatz. Fahrt bis zur Station ""Großer Stern"" (5 Stationen).

3) [Die Siegessäule](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Siegess%C3%A4ule2011Schuschke.JPG)
[Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegess%C3%A4ule_Berlin)

Die Siegessäule kann besichtigt werden, dies kostet allerdings Eintritt (um zu ihr zu gelangen müsst Ihr eine der Unterführungen auf der anderen Straßenseite nehmen). Schaut euch etwas in der Gegend um (geht einmal um die Siegessäule herum) unter anderem werdet ihr eine Statue von [Bismarck](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Bismarck_Begas_Berlin_Totale.jpg) finden.

Folgt der [100 Linie](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/de/binaries/asset/download/22168/file/1-1) weiter zu Fuß (Es ist nur eine Station) und Ihr werdet zu Schloß Bellevue (linke Seite) gelangen.

4) [Schloss Bellevue/ Die Spree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/2006-09-19_Berlin_Bellevue.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Bellevue)

Von Schloss Bellevue könnt ihr entweder den [Bus 100](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/de/binaries/asset/download/22168/file/1-1) zum Reichstag nehmen oder Ihr könnt, was Ich empfehlen würde, die Strecke an der Spree entlang laufen.

Solltet Ihr die Strecke laufen, kommt ihr unter anderem am [Haus der Kulturen der Welt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_der_Kulturen_der_Welt) vorbei. In der Ferne kann man auch das [Kanzleramt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeskanzleramt_%28Berlin%29) sehen. **Für die Strecke vom Schloss Bellevue zum Reichstag müsst ihr *nicht* die Spree überqueren, geht über keine Brücke.** Es lohnt sich auch ein Stück durch den Großen Tiergarten zu gehen (rechte Seite). Um zum Reichstag zu gelangen, folgt aber einfach der John-Foster-Dulles-Allee.

5) [Der Reichstag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Reichstag_building_Berlin_view_from_west_before_sunset.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstagsgeb%C3%A4ude)

Von hier aus ist es nur noch einen Katzensprung zum [Brandenburger Tor:](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Brandenburger_Tor_2005_006.JPG) Geht am Reichstag vorbei und folgt der Ebertsstraße, um am [Platz des 18. März](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platz_des_18._M%C3%A4rz) zu landen.

6) [Das Brandenburger Tor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Brandenburger_Tor_abends.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburger_Tor)

Auf der anderen Seite des Tors befinden sich einige Straßenkünstler. Leider kann es auch vorkommen, dass einige agressive Bettler ihr Unwesen treiben, passt auf Eure Handtaschen auf! Um zum nächsten Zielpunkt zu kommen, geht wieder durch das Brandenburger Tor und folgt einfach weiterhin der Ebertsstraße.

7) [Das Denkmal für die ermordeten Juden Europas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Holocaust_memorial_tree.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkmal_f%C3%BCr_die_ermordeten_Juden_Europas)

Von Außen mag das Mahnmal für Einige vielleicht unspektakulär wirken, daher rate ich auf jeden Fall in das Mahnmal hineinzugehen. Herumklettern auf den Steinen ist soweit ich weiß nicht erwünscht. Folgt anschließend der Ebertsstraße weiter zum [Potsdamer Platz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Train_station_Berlin_Potsdamer_Platz.jpg)

8) [Potsdamer Platz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/16199_dbtower_duhanic.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdamer_Platz)

Hier werdet ihr noch ein Stück der [Berliner Mauer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Mauer)finden, der Verlauf der Mauer wurde auch durch in den Boden eingelassene [Pflastersteine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Berlin_wall_at_Potsdamer_Platz_March_2009.jpg) gekennzeichnet. Von hier aus ist es nicht mehr weit bis zum [Sony Center](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Sony_Center_Berlin.jpg).

9) [Sony Center](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/SonyCenterAtNight.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Center)

Für Freunde des englischsprachigen Films: Das Cinestar im Sony Center zeigt Filme mit origninal Synchronisation.
Wenn Ihr begeisterte Biertrinker seid, müsst ihr umbedingt eine Pause im [Lindenbräu](http://www.linden-hopfinger-braeu.de/lindenbraeu/lindenbraeu-im-sonycenter_startseite_de.html) machen und das Weissbier probieren. Man beachte den Braukessel im Lokal.

Nehmt vom Potsdamer Platz eine S-Bahn und fahrt bis ""Friedrichstraße"" (S1, S2 oder S25). Geht in der Station ""Friedrichstraße"" die Treppe hoch und dann die Große Halle entlang bis zum Ausgang ganz hinten (vorbei am Wienerfeinbäcker und Burger King, nehmt keinen Seitenausgang). Wenn ihr den richtigen Ausgang genommen habt, müsstet ihr direkt unter einer Brücke sein, über euch fährt die Bahn. Rechts von Euch sind Haltestellen für die Tram/Straßenbahn und drei Ampeln, die euch auf die andere Straßenseite bringen. Folgt der Georgenstraße, ihr werdet an mehren Bars und Restaurant vorbeikommen. Solltet ihr Hunger haben, empfehle ich das ""12 Apostel"", dort gibt es sehr gute Steinofenpizza, kostet aber auch etwas mehr. Nach dem ""12 Apostel"" geht die nächste Straße (Am Kupfergraben) nach Rechts an der Spree entlang.

10) [Die Museumsinsel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Berlin_Museumsinsel_Fernsehturm.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museumsinsel_%28Berlin%29)

Als erstes werdet ihr das [Pergamonmuseum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamonmuseum) auf der linken Seite sehen. Gegenüber, auf der rechten Straßenseite patroullieren meistens zwei Polizisten, soweit ich weiß hat Bundeskanzlerin Merkel dort eine Wohnung.

Folgt ""Am Kupfergraben"" bis ihr zu Bodestraße kommt, geht dann nach links über die Spree bis zum Säulengang. Hinter den Säulen befindet sich unter anderem die [Alte Nationalgalerie](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Nationalgalerie). Geht anschließend rechts die Straße ""Am Lustgarten"" rein (vor der Brücke, zwischen dem [Alten Museum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Museum_%28Berlin%29) und dem Berliner Dom).

11) [Der Berliner Dom](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/2006_Berliner_Dom_Front.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Dom)

Vor Euch liegt nun der [Lustgarten](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Lustgartenvdom.jpg) gegenüber vom Alten Museum verläuft eine große Straße (Unter den Linden/ Schloßplatz). Geht über die Ampel und folgt der Straße Richtung [Fernsehturm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Berlin_Fernsehturm_2005.jpg). Wenn ihr die Spree ein weiteres Mal überquert habt, müsstet ihr euch vor einer Parkanlage befinden. Geht quer durch den Park, vorbei an [Marx und Engels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Marx-Engels-Denkmal_April_2011.jpg), weiterhin Richtung Fernsehturm. Ihr müsstet das [Rote Rathaus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Rotes_Rathaus_und_Fernsehturm.jpg) bereits sehen können.

12) [Das Rote Rathaus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Berlin-alex-rathaus-2010-041.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotes_Rathaus)

Geht über die ""Spandauer Straße"" vorbei am Roten Rathaus und dem [Neptunbrunnen.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunbrunnen_%28Berlin%29)

13) [Der Berliner Fernsehturm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Fernsehturm_berlin.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin)

Von hier aus folgt ihr am besten der ""Rathausstraße"", vorbei an Dunkin' Donuts und CineStar Berlin. Geht unter der Brücke/Unterführung durch (oben fährt die Bahn) und ihr erreicht den vorletzten Halt der Tour.

14) [Der Alexanderplatz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Berlin-alex-weltzeitt-2010-026.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz)

Von der [Weltzeituhr](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltzeituhr) ist es nicht mehr weit bis zum [Alexa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_%28Einkaufszentrum%29), falls ihr shoppen wollt (Fragt euch einfach durch).

Nehmt vom Alexanderplatz die S5, S7 oder S75 zur Station ""Hackescher Markt"". Hier gibt es unten in der S-Bahn Station einen netten Irish Pub namens ""Kilkenny"". Folgt der Straße ""Neue Promenade"" bis diese in der Straße ""An der Spandauer Brücke"" endet. Von hier aus geht ihr nach links bis zur ""Oranienburger Straße"".

15) [Die Hackeschen Höfe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Hackesche_H%C3%B6fe_3a.jpg)
[Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackesche_H%C3%B6fe)

[Der Eingang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/HackescheH%C3%B6fe_5.png) zu den Hackeschen Höfen ist ungefähr dort, wo die Oranienburger Straße auf die Rosenthaler Straße trifft.

Das war meine Stadttour, wenn ihr jetzt noch immer nicht genug habt, nehmt von Hackescher Markt oder Alexanderplatz die S5, S7 oder S75 bis  ""Warschauer Str."" und taucht in das Nachtleben von Friedrichshain ein. Vergesst nicht mir vorher eine PM zu schreiben, damit ich auf ein Bier vorbeikomme. ;-)


**Tipps und Tricks**

* ACHTUNG! Diese Tour nimmt viel Zeit in Anspruch, man sollte früh aufstehen, um alles zu schaffen. Plant auch Zeit für Essen usw. ein.

* Bedenkt auch, dass die Tour sehr viele Eindrücke vermittelt, wenn Ihr mehr als einen Tag Zeit habt, solltet ihr vielleicht das Programm auf Zwei Tage splitten. So bleibt auch mehr Zeit für andere Dinge, wie z. B. ein Museumsbesuch oder Shopping.

* Sicherheit: Die Tour bringt Euch zu beliebten Touristenorten, passt auf Eure Taschen auf.

* Verkehrsanbindungen:
[http://www.bvg.de/](http://www.bvg.de/)
ist die wichtigste Seite für Euren Berlin-Aufenthalt. Hier könnt Ihr sämtliche Verbindungen mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln finden. Solltet Ihr kein (mobiles) Internet haben, empfehle ich in den Bussen nach kleinen Heftchen Ausschau zu halten. Diese sind komplett kostenlos und haben in der Mitte einen kleinen Rutenplan.

* Bus fahren: Man muss vorne einsteigen und dem Busfahrer sein Ticket zeigen (auch wenn die Meisten nicht wirklich drauf gucken). Ich wurde noch nie im Bus kontrolliert, nachdem ich am Busfahrer vorbei war. Es ist also möglich mit einem alten Ticket schwarz zufahren. Aber in der Bahn, S-Bahn und U-Bahn ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, kontrolliert zu werden und das kann teuer werden...


*Korrekturen und Verbesserungsvorschläge bitte an mich via PM schicken.*

*Zögert nicht diesen Guide in eine andere Sprache zu übersetzen und hier zu posten.*

I missed the last couple of meetups, and I miss you all. So let's have another, at a location that has proved itself to be meetup-friendly over the years, both in terms of prices and not getting angry when we show up with hundreds of people. So:

Feedback on the last couple of meetups has called for something that breaks out of the table-service curse of Berlin bars and that gets us a bit further westward, and your friendly moderator DELIVERS ON BOTH COUNTS.

Join me at **E. &amp; M. Leydicke**, Mansteinstr. 4, 10783 Berlin–Schöneberg (S/U Yorkstraße) on **Saturday, 24 November** at **18:00** for a Reddit meetup sure to be unlike any previous, if only because we are crowded around the bar rather than marooned at tables in Kreuzlauermitte somewhere.  

**If you are worried about finding the group**, (a) do something about it: wear a Reddit t-shirt or print an alien and stick it to yourself or something, and (b) come find me. **[I look like this](http://i.imgur.com/Xk6Aq.jpg).**

Open the application, click the on the place you're interested in and you will see all public transport lines of stations near this place and where they are heading exactly based on the stations' GPS coordinates.

And finally, from the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Ispostingpersonalinformationok):

&gt;Is posting personal information ok?

&gt;NO. Reddit is a pretty open and free speech place, but it is not ok to post someone's personal information, or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people and certain individual information, including personal info found online is often false. Such posts or comments may be removed by moderators or admins. Repeated offenders may be banned. Posting professional links to contact a congressman or the CEO of some company is probably fine, but don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or vote up obvious vigilantism.

1370107964.0	1fh0pf	Global Reddit Meetup Day -- June 15th. Mark your calendars! **Planning thread**	eu_or_aus	26	7	26	"Please upvote for visibility! Relevant [comic](http://debsanderrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DAE_120611_345M_RedditMeetup.png).

So, Global Reddit Meetup Day is on the 15th of June this year, which is the Saturday after next. 

In earlier years, the meetup has been a picnic and also in other locations, its been a bar etc. Let's propose some suggestions! My suggestion is Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg or Görlitzerpark, also in Kreuzberg. Other suggestions are naturally welcome. 

I always love a picnic and its cheap, aka BYOB and BYOF. The way I've organized meetups like this before is to give everyone something to bring apart from whatever to drink, saves us from eating a million bratwursts. Of course, multiple people can bring the same category of item because we'll likely need more than one packet of chips and one brötchen. :)  

- Grill(s): 
- Bratwurst/Sausage:  
- Hamburger meat: **discohead**
- Brötchen/Hot dog buns/hamburger buns: **discohead**
- Chicken/chicken wings/anything that isn't sausage or hamburger and goes on the grill: 
- Chips: 
- Frisbee etc: **Pannonica1917** (badminton)
- Dessert/Pie/whatever: **Pelirrojita**

Also, in parallel with the BBQ/picnic planning, let's propose a bar or restaurant we can meet at if it rains that day, keeping in mind the weather we've been having.

So I forgot my wallet on the tram last month and only realized when the Kontrollers got on to check tickets. I reached for my wallet, realized it wasn't there and started walking towards the ticket machine because I had a few coins in the pocket. The BVG guy pushed me back and said No no you need to get off the tram. So I did and I also called my girlfriend to get her to bring my wallet to me. 

So then the issue was that I did not have any money or SURPRISE my ID! Because my FUCKING WALLET WAS AT HOME! So the BVG called the police. They came. My girlfriend came with my wallet (which had my ID and enough money to pay the fine). But instead of taking that, they handed the whole thing over to the police. The police told me to go pay the fine and everything should be fine.

SO I went and paid the fine in full. No problem. Story ended. So I thought.

BUT NO! I got a letter a few days ago from the Berlin police saying that they were pressing charges and that I need to acknowledge the charge.

To make this more complicated, I used to have a student card and I thought it was still valid for another month. Turns out it wasn't. So I was definitely a Schwarzrider but after paying the fine, shouldn't it be enough?!

I have NO idea what is going to happen. Am I going to get fined? Be put on probation? Jail?! I just forgot my stupid wallet and made a mistake in judgement. But I PAID the BVG's fine! 

Does anyone have any advice at all for me? I would really appreciate it. ughhhhhhhhhhhh

The 7 day path to the public transportation proved to be extremely useful. Not only did I save some money. The ride where much more fluent and comfortable. I didn't need to search for the ticket vending machine and try and guess what region am I going to. 

I also thank you for the apps tips.

Bin nicht hier um sinnlos, stumpf und ohne Fokus mein Missfallen eurer Taten ins Internet hinaus zu schreien, in der Hoffnung, dass auch nur einer von euch meinen Appell an eure Moral hört, geschweige den ernst nimmt. Nein, ich kann mir schon denken, dass solch ein Versuch fruchtlos wäre.

Nichtsdestotrotz möchte ich euch kollektiv, wer auch immer ihr seid, sagen, dass das was ihr tut, egal was ihr denkt was ihr tut, falsch ist. Ich bin kein 48-jähriger, verbitterter, verspießter Mittelständler, der Nachts, nach getaner Arbeit, in seiner Wohnung sitzt, und verbittert die Tagesschau sieht, während ich mit einem Auge ängstlich durch meine zurückgezogenen Vorhänge auf meinen mühsam verdienten Passat starre. Ich bin höchstwahrscheinlich einer von euch - wer auch immer ihr sein mögt. Deswegen nehmt euch die Zeit und lest das hier.

Egal was eure Agenda ist, selbst wenn ihr denk ihr habt keine Agenda, ist euer Vorgehen vom Grundprinzip auf schlecht für eure Ziele. Selbst falls ihr jugendliche Chaoten seit, die kaum Haare am Sack haben, die nur Autos anzünden weil es ihnen Spass macht und einen Adrenalin-kick gibt ist es dumm von euch so viele Autos in so kurzer Zeit anzuzünden. Es ist jetzt Wahlkampf... Wowereit will, genau wie jeder andere Politiker, wiedergewählt werden. Ihr seid nicht die Hauptwählerschaft. Die Leute, die ihr schickaniert und deren Eigentum ihr zerstört, das sind die Menschen, die die Politik durch das wählen beeinflussen. Denkt ihr wirklich, dass der Bürgermeister so kurz vor den Wahlern Bürgerstimmen einfach so verloren gibt? Denkt doch mal nach. Schaut euch Amerika an, England, Syrien, Libyen, Chile, China. Egal ob ein Regime totalitär ist oder nicht, die Machthaber gehen gezielt gegen Unruhe-stifter vor und hier hat die Politik sogar die breite Masse auf ihrer Seite. Falls sich eurer Vandalismus ausweitet, werded ihr nichts weiter erreichen als erhöhte Polizei-präsenz, erhöhte Gewaltbereitschaft der Polizei und erhöhte Finanzierung der Staatsmacht. Im Endeffekt wird der Staat, der um einiges mehr Resourcen zur Hand hat als ihr, euch so haushoch überlegen sein, dass ihr keine Chance mehr habt. Das ist die Realität. Ja, die Unruhen in London waren ein paar Tage lang wirklich krass... aber was ist geblieben? Die Normalität des Alltags ist zurück und niemand mehr denkt darüber nach. Das gleiche Schicksal droht eurem Chaos. Fahrt eure Schiene zurück. Ihr werdet keine Helden. Ihr werdet keine Bösewichte. Euer Chaos wird zu Ordnung werden. Euer Ruhm wird in einem Wimpernschlag vergessen sein.

Falls eure Motivation politisch ist, so ist euer Vorgehen auch falsch. Wollt ihr ein Zeichen setzen? Ein Gewaltsamer Protest gegen die Staatsmacht? Wollt ihr zeigen was ihr könnt? Ihr macht es falsch! Eine Bewegung ohne Wiedererkennungswert ist keine Bewegung. Es ist nicht bekannt ob ihr eine Gruppe seid oder nicht. Es ist nicht bekannt ob ihr euch organisiert. Es ist nicht bekannt wie viele ihr seid. Niemand weiss was oder wer ihr seid. Selbst Anonymous, eine Bewegung, die eben dadurch lebt, dass alle Mitglieder anonym sind, hat ein Gesicht in der öffentlichkeit. Die Bewegung hat nicht nur einen Namen - sie hat eine weithin bekannt Agenda, ein Gesicht (die Maske) und Wiedererkunnungs wert. Zudem bekennt sie sich zu ihren Taten. Schaut euch irgendeine Gruppe an, die schonmal politische Macht besessen hat. Die Rote Armee Fraktion, Al-Qaeda, LOLSec und Anonymous hatten alle ein Gesich in der öffentlichkeit. Ein Zeichen. Eine politische Agenda. So wie ihr momentan vorgeht, werdet ihr nichts bewegen.

Falls ihr Anarchisten seid: Chaos ist toll solange es hält. Aber in einem System, das von Ordnung lebt und sich durch Ordnung selbst erhält, wird Chaos eine Narbe lassen, die sich dadurch auszeichnet, dass sie fester und wiederstandsfähiger ist als das System davor. In Deutschland will niemand grossflächig randalieren. Wir sind nicht in Syrien und nicht in Ägypten. Wir sind nicht in China und nicht in Libyen. Wir leben in einer der grössten Volkswirtschaften der Welt, mit hoher Lebenserwartung, unglaublichem technologischem Vortschritt, toller Infrastruktur, einem sehr guten Schulsystem mit hohen Spitzensteuersätzen und 1A sozialleistungen. Die grössten Probleme, die wir haben sind Atomkraftwerke und Eurobonds... denkt ihr wirklich, dass die Masse hier demonstrieren will? Die Leute mögen Ordnung, und nur weil ihr Ordnung nicht mögt, heisst das noch lange nicht, dass viele Menschen mit euch übereinstimmen. Bei den Rechten, die wir schon haben, sind die Menschen bereit noch ein paar Rechte abzugeben... vor allem wenn sie Angst haben müssen, dass jemand ihr Eigentum zerstört. Falls ihr Anarchisten seid, werdet ihr, falls ihr so weiter macht, ein System kreieren in dem mehr Ordnung und mehr Staatsmacht heerscht als vorher noch.

Euer vorhaben, bzw. die Art und Weise auf die ihr es momentan angeht, ist grundlegens selbst-destruktiv und zum scheitern verurteilt. Lasst den Leuten in Berlin ihren Schlaf. Wenn ihr Sachen anzünden wollt, such euch etwas trivialeres als Autos. So bekommt man auch seinen Spass... alternativ könnt ihr auch einfach zu McDonald's gehen. Ich hab gehört, dass man in den Ball-pools echt fun bekommt.

**TL;DR:**

Egal welche Art von Mensch ihr seid und was ihr mit dem Brandstiften bewerkstelligen wollt, ihr macht es falsch! Hört auf, macht es weniger oder organisiert euch mit Gesicht. So wie ihr jetzt vorgeht räumt ihr der Staatsmacht, auf lange Sicht, mehr Macht ein und bringt euch selbst in Vergessenheit oder in den Knast.

No matter what kind of a person you are, and what you want to achieve by burning cars, you're approaching it in the wrong manner! Stop doing what you're doing, cut back on the arson or get organized with an identifiable agenda for the public. The way you are proceeding at the moment, you are giving the state more power in the long run and you will either end up forgotten or in prison.

Da ich hier desöfteren leute in desperater Suche nach Zimmern bzw Wohnungen sehe dachte ich mir es wäre womöglich eine gute Idee meine suche nach Mitbewohnern auf r/Berlin zu erweitern und euch damit die Möglichkeit zu geben ebenfalls euch womöglich auf die Räume zu bewerben.

Nunja, nunmal los. 
Die WG befindet sich in Nord-Charlottenburg ca 15minuten Fussweg vom Schloss Charlottenburg und dem dazugehörigen Schlosspark entfernt. Die Anbindung zur U7 via der Station Jakob-Kaiserplatz sowie der S-Bahn Station Jungfernheide (Ringbahn) sind mit 5 und 10 minuten Fussweg auch bestens.
Die Wohnung selbst befindet sich im 2.ten Stock eines Mehrfamiliien Hauses mit ruhigen und freundlichen Nachbarn die keinerlei probleme bereiten.
Zu den Zimmern an sich. Es handelt sich wie schon gesagt um 2 Zimmer. Ein kleineres mit ca 14 qm sowie ein grösseres mit ungefähr 24 qm welches ausserdem zugang zum Balkon hat und einen seperaten Eingang zur Kueche ( kein Durchgangszimmer ). 
Die Wohnung verfuegt natuerlich ausserdem auch noch ueber eine eingerichtete Kueche sowie ein Bad mit Badewanne.

Internet und Telefon sind vorhanden und können ab Einzug sofort benutzt werden.

Zum den preisen fuer die beiden Zimmer. Das kleinere wuerde um die 180-200 Euro warm kosten plus ungefähr 15 euro kosten fuer Strom/Internet/Telefon.
Das grössere wuerde in die Preisklasse von 310 euro Warmmiete fallen plus die oben genannten nebenkosten von ungefähr 15 Euro.

Solltet ihr weitere Fragen haben oder Interesse dann schreibt mich gerne an und fuegt auch gerne eine Telefonnummer hinzu so das wir euch einfach erreichen können!

I am a 24 year old guy originally from Spain and I have received an amazing job offer in Berlin in a local software development company. So suddenly I am abandoning all confort, my job and my friends and jumping countries because, hey, this sounds exciting! And of course now I find myself in the situation of needing somewhere to live.

I a looking for a flat share anywhere in Berlin (that is well connected) so I can set up and find some longer term housing, or even just straight away find a place to stay for as long as this thing goes.

I of course have sent some messages on wg-gesucht and even put up my own ad, but I know for a fact that people here on reddit tend to be nice and good, so not posting here too would be stupid.

Anyway, if you either are missing a flatmate, or just moving in and looking for friends, or wanting to sublet your room or any combination of the above by mid-June for any amount of time, please message me!

See you around, people. And sorry for being sort of spammy :P"	t5_2qt49	True

I would like to apply for a working holiday visa in Europe, and I'm leaning towards Berlin because it seems to be an affordable western European city, and apparently it has a booming software scene.

Does anyone have any knowledge or experience in the reality of software development in Berlin? Internet says start ups are popping up in Berlin, there's even a site dedicated to start ups at http://berlinstartupjobs.com.

Questions I have:

* How likely am I do find a job? Will knowing English only and not from Europe be a significant disadvantage? I don't mind learning languages, but I don't expect to be very fluent in the given time.
* How much can I expect to get pay? Most jobs seem to be web based, I don't have a problem with that, but I have most experience in database and desktop business software. I've been working 6 yrs, would 40-50k be reasonable?
* Since this is part holiday, flexible hours would be desirable. Is this a common possibility? e.g. occasionally work Sat &amp; Sun, and take 4 day weekend the next week.
* Any links to relevant resources?
* Anything else I should know about?

Also, if you know of any specific job openings, I'm keen!

1360698861.0	18e8n6	Hey Berlin redditors, I could use your help for a cartoon project (long post, but I tried my best to keep it short)	jdclewis	18	1	12	"Hello r/berlin,

I work in Berlin making digital 2D animation for E-Learning and a couple of children TV shows in the past. For the last months I've been working on the script for my first independent project and I'm finally ready to start putting the production in motion.

My goal is to start a free cartoon web series. Since I'm doing this afterhours with a really small team of animators, it will be far far away from Disney quality (not that I could do it anyway). It's rather a low budget youtube series. The first step is obviously the production of a 5-6 minute pilot. My office colleagues will help me with the visual development, but I have to find a way to incorporate music and voice actors, which are at least 50% as important as the animation for the quality of the show, which is funny, because one of them will take a couple of hours and the other several months.

I tend to write too much, I'll get to the point, I promise, bear with me a little... I decided to produce the series in English although it is (clearly) not my native language, because it's the best way to boost the show internationally. Don't worry, the script is being revised by a very smart and kind canadian, it won't be in my broken English. 

So, I'm looking for native English speakers in Berlin who could like the idea of lending their voice to a cartoon character. If my calculations are not entirely wrong, the main character won't have more than 3 minutes of text. Basically I would find a studio or place where we can record and arrange an appointment with the voice actors and in my optimistic mind we would be done in two hours (if the parts are practiced before). Now, if you are an experienced voice actor, I will kindly ask you to look away and cover your ears for a moment while I say this: since I'm financing this project with the money under the mattress that I call my savings and I still have to pay music and recording equipment, I can not offer you lots of money, but I am definitely willing to pay for this, I don't expect anyone to work for free. Before you throw downvotes like stones, I'd like to say that I have nothing but respect for the work of an actor and I'm sure they are worth every cent they charge, I just can't afford it, which is why I'm taking my chances and looking for hobby actors or just people who think they would enjoy this and do a decent job.

This post was way shorter in my head. For those who are still reading, what I can offer is a small pay and a a couple of rounds of drinks on me somewhere in Friedrichshain. The show is basically about a group of cazies who take the HP Lovecraft mythology too seriously and has 4 main characters (two girls and two guys, Alison Bechdel would be proud) and 3 secondary (two guy and an old lady). I already contacted the boyfriend of a very friendly redditor and he showed interest. If anyone else is interested, please contact me and I'll answer all your questions. Character design and Storyboard should be ready this week, so that I can show you something.

Thank you very much for your attention!

I've been to Berlin about six times and I've put together all the cool clubs, places to eat, cafes, and bars I've visited in Berlin on Google Maps. I also added a few places that were recommended to me. 

I mainly like alternative places with a cozy atmosphere and clubs where they play indie, rock, or at least something danceable. If you have any recommendations please let me know, and I'll then add it to the map so that others can also check it out. I'm going to Berlin next week again for a week, so I'd love to check out some new places. The green marks on the map are clubs and the martini glasses are bars.

The highlights of the places I've visited were:

Rosie's

Cassiopeia 

Mustafa's Doner Kebab

Tacheles

Mano

Lido

After sending a few dozen e-mails and a couple of calls, I've run into quite a few people trying to convince me that they are away for some reason and, as such, can't be there to display the apartment/sign the lease/give in the keys. So far I've found these pearls:

- Guy that is a really successful entrepreneur living in London and has a really cool apartment that he needs to rent, but he took the keys with him, so you should just go to the appointed address and look at the apartment from the outside;
- Guy that lives with his wife in Dubai because he's a contractor but is really honest, hardworking, God-fearing gentleman (as he describes himself). He's so busy that he needs someone to look after his totally cool apartment;
- Guy that is a student in Köln and has a really kickass apartment (or several of them, since he's replied to a few of my messages in different sites, all with similar descriptions but different addresses) but really can't put down his books, since he's having exams right now, so he'll have to post you the keys after you send in the money and signed contract.

These, in case it is not clear enough, are scams. I know it's obvious for most of you, but I still feel like is should be mentioned. The details usually only come about after the initial contact. I should point out that on the websites, the postings that originated these ""offers"" ranged from normal looking to sparse offerings requesting an e-mail to learn more about the room/apartment."	t5_2qt49	True

Also, we could make it a pot-luck brunch tomorrow, if people like brunch.

I live in Pankow (Vinetastraße), or we could meet in a park somewhere more central and have a picnic.  Pancakes are good cold, too.  I have a lot of bananas, so there will be many pancakes.

Edit: I am suggesting 1pm for pancakes.

Edit 2: I also might attempt these, because the only thing I would need to buy is nutmeg, so what the heck: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/louisiana-sweet-potato-pancakes/detail.aspx

Edit 3: Volkspark Humboldthain has been suggested, sounds good to me.

**Edit 4: The plan:** We'll meet at the southwest corner of Volkspark Humboldthain (Scheringstrasse/Gustav-Meyer-Allee and Hussitenstrasse/Volkspark Humboldthain) at 1pm.  We will find a nice place to eat some pancakes.  If you are worried you'll have trouble finding us, pm me for my cell number.  Or look for the people eating pancakes.

My total favorite is on the U2 line though, starting at Bülowstr. riding towards Gleisdreiek. Stand at a door/window in the last carriage on the left side, and enjoy the little rollercoaster-like shakes first, and then the awesome approach of the Gleisdreiek station, with an U1 just driving off, and Potsdammer platz in the distance. Even my dad loved it.

I've still got free transport through the whole of Berlin till the end of the summer, anybody got some great stretches i should ride? Especially a nice and long night time doubledecker stretch would be good (From Zoo through Ku'dam isn't bad in that respect)

2. It's alright, but the neighborhood is not nearly as cozy as Friedrichshain, where I used to live...I love my apartment, it's quite big and sunny, so that's great, but the neighborhood can be a bit depressing sometimes. There are some nice bars in the area though. I was really disappointed by limited amount of places to get good (and cheap) food like in Friedrichshain.

3. I really like [Weine und Geflügel](http://www.qype.com/place/151946-Weine-Gefluegel-Berlin), a cool bar which is at the end of my street. It's very cozy and it has this living room style atmosphere. I also enjoy the Flea Market which we have on Saturday's at Leopoldplatz. 
And there's another bar nearby which is called [JATZ](http://www.qype.com/place/16459-JATZ-Bar-Berlin) which is pretty awesome. Oh and there's [Kiki Sol](http://www.qype.com/place/1971074-Kiki-Sol-Berlin) which have cool open mic nights on Wednesdays and Fridays.

4. Can't think of anything atm..

And then if you bite (My warning bells were chiming, but I decided to answer just in case) they'll come with the following proposition:

&gt; We can not meet to show you the apartment because I can't take off 
&gt; from work , that's why I would like to use an legitimate delivery 
&gt; company to handle the transaction in my behalf , the delivery 
&gt; company will contact you with the keys and contract of the apt in

So I stumbled around on their website and found some befriended clubs like [The Pantheon Bar](http://thepantheonbar.org/) or places run by the same people, like [Naherholung Sternchen](http://www.naherholung-sternchen.de/) or [Zur Möbelfabrik](http://zurmoebelfabrik.de/). Now I have to say that I haven't been at any of these, but they look pretty exciting too :3

I think you need a decent amount of comment karma to be able to edit the page. If you don't have enough karma, I'm sure you can ask someone (me, for example) to add stuff for you. Or you could comment like crazy or ask the admins for editing privileges.

Subsections would probably a good idea. Anyone interested?

We've been doing meetups every other month recently, and I think it's a good rhythm. It also means that March is time for another one, and we need a location. Help me find one. Here are the criteria for a good Reddit meetup location:

* **We shouldn't be trapped around tables.** This is the most important factor. For a good meetup, everyone needs to be free to mix up the conversation groups often and freely. It's why the last two meetups have been so awesome.

* **We should rotate around Berlin a little bit.** The last four meetups have been in Neukölln, Schöneberg, Prenzlauer Berg, and Mitte, respectively. It would be nice if we could go to Wedding, Friedrichshain, or Charlottenburg this time.
* **It should be moderately priced.** Doesn't have to be a Hartz-IV-Kneipe, but there's a reason I've never hosted a meetup at Newton: reddit is a little too casual for €3000 hookers and walk-in humidor.

A new [Kiez Oper](https://www.facebook.com/KiezOper) show, collaborating with the Berlin Film Society.

A very unique Christmas event. Combining István Szabó’s 1981 Oscar-winning film, ‘MEPHISTO’, with live performances from Charles Gounod’s 1851 Grand Opera, ‘FAUST’, the Berlin Film Society and Kiez Oper will create a new cross-medium narrative inspired by Goethe’s original 1808 text, befittingly hosted in Kreuzberg’s very own Faust-inspired club, GRETCHEN. Gounod’s opera will serve as a provocative prelude and postlude to Szabó’s critically-acclaimed film, offering an operatic extension to the central themes explored in the film and boasting a cast from the International Studio at the Staatsoper! To accompany the dark and sinister flavours of the evening, the new Berlin-based liquor, PIJÖKEL 55, will serve complimentary welcome drinks from 7pm. The after party (from 11:30pm) at Gretchen is equally as eclectic, featuring the finest drum’n’bass in the city! Film + Opera + Rave!

My questions are such:


QUESTION ONE:
What are my job options? I know the pickings are slim for non-German speakers, sometimes even nonexistent. But I'd like to know where to start given my background.
My background: B.Sc. Psychology, worked as an ABA therapist for kids with autism for 8 years. I also have a TEFL certificate. I don't speak German but I am fluent in French and English.
So what are my options? Teachers aide at international schools? Under the table ABA with expat's kids? Teaching English?




QUESTION TWO:
Visas. From what I have seen, my best bet is to come on a working holiday visa, then find a job and apply for a working visa with that job. Is that so?
What if we end up marrying in Berlin. Am I then covered by his Visa? By his health insurance? Can I work? I would imagine that as his spouse, his visa would extend to me, but I would also imagine that a lot of people marry for the visa, so there must be some catches somewhere to prevent that...

1343039915.0	x0dss	Meetup on the 28th	th0ric	14	1	24	"Hello everyone. As some of you may be aware, there is a meetup planned by /r/Gaymers ([Description Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/vqw5l/you_asked_we_deliver_the_longawaited_berlin_meetup/)) taking place on the 28th. 


Thorva and I have been discussing the possibility of creating a super-event in which we will join the Gaymer event as they head out into the crisp Berlin air for a night of Berlin bar activities. This initial meeting will take place between the hours of 7 and 9 PM (19:00 and 21:00 for you european folk). 

The tentative plan is for us to meet at a gay bar of Thorva's choosing. He has assured me that he will be choosing a bar that is heterosexual friendly, so please leave your [nunchuks](http://www.roundhousekick.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/nunchucks.jpg) at home. 

However, it is advised that you bring your dancing shoes. If you are afraid of coming because you are not a very good dancer, have no fear. [Dancing is really quite simple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vlkWUPhJCw&amp;list=PLFD1E8B0910A73A12&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plpp_video).

If anyone has any questions/comments/concerns, please feel free to post below.

Edit: We will be meeting at Silver Future, Weserstraße 206 in Neukölln. Also, if people want to suggest ideas for meeting up before we head to the bar, feel free!

Edit: MilezzZ has suggested Volkspark Hasenheide. It is located right next to U8 Hermannsplatz. 

Update: I cannot say no to anything MilezzZ suggests, so we will be meeting at [Volkspark Hasenheide](https://maps.google.de/maps?hl=de&amp;q=52.483136,13.416385&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x47a84fc73c454521:0x8832c4b33e0921e6,%2B52%C2%B0+28%27+59.30%22,+%2B13%C2%B0+24%27+59.30%22&amp;gl=de&amp;ei=SBQRUPLaII_EsgaN-YCIDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA). So we don't have complications like last time, the coordinates are 52.483136,13.416385 and should locate you in the center of the area that looks like a target. 

Newest Update: MilezzZ has the worst ideas ever. We are now going to meet in the northern section of Tempelhofer Feld. Here is an [imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/ROKFh) showing the location. Since I am American, we will obviously be meeting between the baseball fields. Let's meet between 15:00 and 16:00 . And it might be rainy in the evening, so bring those umbrellas!

Berlin police are investigating the case of an English-speaking teenager who appeared in the German capital saying he had lived the last five years in the woods with his father.

The boy, aged about 17, appeared at Berlin's city hall on September 5 and was then taken in by a youth emergency centre.

Police say the boy claims that he and his father took to the woods about five years ago after his mother died and have been living in a tent and earth huts.

The boy - who says he does not remember where the family came from - claims he followed his compass north after his father recently died, reaching Berlin after walking for two weeks.

The boy appears to be in good health and police have issued a Europe-wide appeal to try to determine his identity. "	t5_2qt49	True

As far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong, Frank Henkel and the CDU formed a coalition with the SPD in the last Berlin elections, and his position was to get 'tough on crime' (a familiar catchphrase in Britain).  A few weeks ago I saw a newspaper in the shop that said ""Ab heute, werden die polizei richtig hart"" or something to that effect.

So I arrive at Schoeneweide S-Bahn this morning, and there are two cops there, talking to an Asian guy, who has a bunch of papers out.  I figured he was a vendor or something, and it sort of made sense, although that should be the Ordungsamt doing that job.   

But they let him go and immediately turned to the next person that wasn't white, someone that looked to me to be Turkish or something like that.   And although I didn't hear the words between them, they obviously stopped him for how he looked, and he was pointing towards the exit as if he was going to work, like pretty much every single other person that was walking out of the station at that time in the morning.

So I have a question:  is this a Schoeneweide thing, do they always stop immigrants and ask for their papers?  Or is this a Frank Henkel, ""now the police are tough guys"" thing?   I've seen this behaviour at Munich train station, people being asked for their papers for having the wrong skin colour, but I was very disappointed to see it in Berlin.  

I've never seen the police interfering with people for no reason before here, and I hope it's not a trend.  "	t5_2qt49	True

My spouse (a German citizen) and I are likely moving to Berlin in Aug 2013.  We keep hearing that the winter is supposedly brutal.  However, when I look at the average temps, it seems the lowest is maybe -5C.  My spouse grew up in Connecticut, and I grew up in Buffalo (where school would be cancelled because the wind chill was -35C), and we've lived in NYC for the past 10 years.  

We'd prefer winter weather that's more like NYC than Buffalo, but can't seem to find a good discussion on Berlin's winter, other than ""OMGZ COLD!""

Anyone from (or w/ experience of) the US Northeast/midwest have an opinion/comparison on winter in Berlin?  Is it really that bad or will we be adequately prepared for it coming from NYC?  Is it just that heat is expensive so buildings are chillier (this was the case in Florence, you get a chill and it's hard to warm up)?  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!


Thanks!


Edit: Thanks for all of the responses!  So the verdict is that it's cold, but not unbearable, snow, but no blizzards, the buildings are warm until people open the windows for fresh air, potentially interrupted public transportation when precipitating, and it is dark and gloomy (but manageable w/ light therapy or extremely positive disposition).

I do think this one is worth checking out though.


Basically, I am involved in founding a new project/company called [Kiez Oper](https://www.facebook.com/KiezOper).

The basic aim is to bring opera bang up to date, dragging it into the 21st century. Performing in unexpected venues to uninitiated audiences.

High quality, high drama, high art. At the same time accessible to everyone, particularly people who would never normally see opera up close.

The first performance(s) will be a two night run on the 20th and 21st July in the garden of Wilde Renate.

The main parts will be performed by members of the prestigious International Studio at the Berlin Staatsoper! Backed by a full Baroque ensemble and staged by one of Britain's most exciting young directors who is the founder of Vignette Productions.

The audience will experience an hour long performance of Dido &amp; Aeneas (by English baroque composer Henry Purcell) with a new twist in not just the location, price and crowd but also the piece itself. It is going to be post-apolocalyptic, drug addled and fucking crazy.

We feel like this will be one of the most exciting and coolest projects happening this summer in Berlin. We just launched the linked to facebook page on Sunday and it has already got a quite heartening response. Obviously the more people that know about it the better! If you're interested you can 'like' the page to keep up with all the latest news and deatils of course!

Feel free to ask me anything you want! Hope to see some of you at one of the shows or maybe even one of our furture projects! :)

edit: Thanks guys, really pleased this seems to be getting such a positive reaction from everyone! Good stuff."	t5_2qt49	True

I'm about to start a new, utterly cool, tech company in January - along with two other top-notch coders.

We would like to have a web designer working with us - we have a couple of freelancing jobs for the beginning (so you should have a Steuernummer), but ideally the thing will go on *forever* - we're not afraid of proper contracts.

The requirements would be:

- A more-than-superficial understanding of usability-related concepts;
- A deep love for standards;
- An in-depth knowledge of HTML 5 and css 3;
- Good design skills;
- A basic knowledge of javascript *or* the capability to write valid (as in: not even one warning) HTML without looking;
- A good English; other languages are a plus.

We'll be in a CoWo type of thing;

we'll have some internal projects and some jobs for clients;

we have way less sexism going on than your typical programming shop (one of the three devs is a girl);

we have a sometimes wry, sometimes plainly 4chanish/idiotic sense of humour - you'll have to endure it;

once we see we fit good together, we'll be happy to talk about your own ideas and see if we can all work on them;

we have *actual money* to pay you.

So, if you're interested PM me with your portfolio and resume/online profile/whatevs.

If you have questions others might be interested in, please post them as a comment.

The other way round, if you are looking for something specific, you can ask if one of the members has one to give away by posting a 'NEED' on the page.

We are hoping to make it take off since the more active members the group has the more interesting it gets! The group aims at being as green and cruelty free as possible, and no money is being exchanged.

My visa is unfortunately coming to an end, and because I have built myself an enjoyable life here I am looking at ways of extending it (currently do not have a job where sponsorship is an option).

One way is to enrol in an intensive German Language course. Which is actually great because I need to improve my German anyway. The catch is that it has to be 18+ hours a week for one month, and not be associated with a partially publically funded school (which I have the feeling the Berlin Volkshochschulen is). 

Ideally the course would be on the cheaper side, certainly no more than 300e. I have already found one (Die Deutsche Schule Berlin) however the location is a little bit difficult for me. I thought I would ask if any of you have had any experience with this 'preparing to study' visa or if any of you could recommend a language school (I live in the friedrichshain area)

I do not have a university degree, but I am enrolled full time for a degree in Creative Writing. I have experience in video game creation, bartending, waitressing, sales, writing, editing, and limited IT knowledge.

I know this is pretty pathetic. But I'm just so desperate. I'll take anything that pays me enough to get by and can help me get a visa. I'm a hard worker, I love working in fact. I just hate being screwed over and taken advantage of (current situation).

I will do literally anything. Anything. If anyone knows of any job that will pay me a decent, living salary, and get me the hell out of this government sanctioned slavery then I will take it."	t5_2qt49	True

I am currently working on a degree online through an American University, but I'm also keen on studying here if it means I can get a visa.

My issue is that my German isn't super good. It will, in no way, be good enough to take University courses here by next wintersemester. I've been looking around at the local Unis for degrees taught in English. I swear that I saw an English speaking Informatik one at Humboldt, but their website is shit and I can no longer find it.

So I reach out to you guys to see if anyone knows of any Uni's that offer English ONLY degrees of some sort. I am already working on a Lit degree, and I have no interest in studying North American History or Economics/Business. If these are the only options for me then I suppose I'm sol. But I figured I'd give it a shot and reach out to Reddit to see if anyone knows of any programs.

If I can't find one then I suppose I'll try to find a job here so I can get a work visa... if none of this pans out I have to go home. =["	t5_2qt49	True

The job opportunity is a startup in my field, though I am having trouble comparing salaries and understanding the offer I have.

My possible employer proposed a monthly salary of 2500 euros a month. My concern is that this amount is going to leave me struggling to get by (remember my American perspective). So help me out guys, I'm not looking to break the bank of this startup, I would be moving across the world to help them grow, but help me understand what kind of lifestyle I can lead with this salary. Or if I should run... 

Other points of interest, what are some good neighborhoods to look for housing?, Are there any San Diegans out there? how was the transition?, Also any other tips/points of advice. I have been watching this subreddit for quite some time and I see posts similar to this, but I would greatly appreciate the support of the community here.

Expecting to wait several hours, I went to Bürgeramt in Charlottenburg at 12:00 thinking I would be taken care of before the office closed at 15:00. My paperwork was already completed. I was told (in German) the office was full for the day and to go somewhere further out.

So I got on a train and went to Spandau. I found the right room and while asking for a number to wait, the official helping me noticed my German wasn't quite up to par. I asked if could be taken care of today and she said yes, but mentioned the person handling my registration might not know English. She then said she would take care of my registration herself! 

Not knowing German got me out of the office in 15 minutes instead of a few hours. She commented that my German wasn't that bad, and said she has the same problems with language when she visits America.

From there one can travel via bus/train practically everywhere in Berlin very fast (10-15 Minutes to Südkreuz and Potsdamer Platz).

A few words according myself: I am a 23 years old game design student currently working on his bachelor-paper. I see myself as a very tolerant and open minded person and I'm looking forward to meet somebody who fits my preferences. Im a big rap music and movies fan and I like to go on festivals and concerts.

I just wanted to give Redditors (and their acquaintances) first notice of an available room in Neukölln starting on the 1st of March. It's fairly small at 12 square meters, but also only 280 euro (heat, internet, biokiste included). It's a four person WG. The people who will remain here are: Myself, an American working in the city, and two masters students (one from Switzerland, one from Austria, both study sociology). The main language of the apartment is German, although I am by no means a perfect speaker and we would welcome anybody who has at least a little desire to learn German. We're also very close to the U7.

We're also looking for somebody who wants to stay in Berlin for longer than 4-5 months, and it's necessary that they're already in the city to visit us in the next couple of weeks (this weekend or next week would be ideal!!)

Please comment or message me if you have interest or if you'd like to recommend somebody who's currently searching!

Edit: Little more info about lifestyle here: We're not really a party-WG, but we definitely enjoy cooking and drinking together. While the room itself is small, we have a very large living room and reasonable storage space. We also have a well-stocked kitchen with a dishwasher, a washing machine, and assorted other appliances (the only things missing from an American perspective are a microwave and dryer). Any further questions, just ask!

1346593680.0	z89oi	Coming to your city in a week. I have a list of specific questions I need answers too..	Triplen01	10	2	26	"Hello Berliners,

Ill be visiting from London in a week and I cant wait. I've read the FAQ but I have quite a few specific questions, so please answer the ones you can :) 

* What is the main supermarket? (preferably cheap, equivalent to Tesco in the UK), I'm staying in apartment and I'd like to buy cereal, snacks, lunch etc. to keep costs down.

* Public Transport. How much would a ticket be to use the S-bahn/U-Bahn for a day/week?

* High vantage points in Berlin? I'd like to take pictures of the city from as high up as possible. I'm aware of the Victory Column and the Fernsehturm, any more? 
Also does any one know where [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/webinteger/5178583954/sizes/l/in/faves-triplen01/) was taken from?

* Safety. I know being a big city there will always be crime, I'm pretty sure its not as bad as here in London. My question is regarding street prostitutes and pimps, are they quite a presence on the street during dark hours? Any areas where they congregate that I should avoid?

* Public swimming. I've heard of lakes around the city where its possible to swim in. Would you recommend it? If so or any specific lakes not too far out of central Berlin you would recommend? If the weather is warm, id definitely consider it.

* Your Favourite Cafe?

* Any places in Berlin that is a must see/visit but not well known?

Thats about it. Im sorry that its a lot of questions, any help would be much appreciated.

Again, I cant wait to visit and thanks in advance!

1321833898.0	mji7t	In a predicament and need advice.	Anesthesiakk	10	1	35	"So as many of you know, I'm an Au Pair. I've been here for all of 6 weeks. My host family is comprised of mom and dad, 2 boys (17 and 15) and 1 girl (12). Yes, the kids are older. But my host parents are both journalists and therefore do a lot of traveling internationally. I knew this coming into it. However, their previous Au Pair assured me that the traveling was quite minimal. The most time he spent running the household (host mom not being around) was 7 weeks. He said it only happened 4 times a year and never for more than 2 weeks at a time.

Now.. like I've said, I've been here for 6 weeks. I still don't have health insurance, nor have I gotten paid for my first 4 weeks of work. This is an issue I've brought up with my host mom several times, but as she has been traveling for the past 2 weeks she hasn't been able to help me out.

Here's my predicament:

I went into this weekend thinking that my 2 weeks of hell (Working 8-9 hour days, 5 days a week. Which is illegal for an Au Pair. Cooking dinner for dad + kids, doing all their laundry even though it's illegal for me to do the parents' laundry, and in every sense of the word running the house.) were over. However, I was wrong. I received an e-mail from my host mom this evening running over the next week's schedule. Apparently she is leaving again tomorrow morning and will be returning Thursday night. However, she has a ball to attend with my host father Friday night, and will be leaving for Cairo the next morning. So this is 4 straight weeks of me doing EVERYTHING for this family. I cook, clean, do laundry, make the kids' beds, clean up their messes, do the shopping, help the kids with their homework, fold my host father's underwear, and pretty much anything else that is involved in running a household.

I don't know what to do. It's illegal for me to work this many hours. However, I still do not have my visa, so I'm afraid to do anything. I only make 260 euro a month. That's the bare minimum an Au Pair makes. I really don't feel like that's fair for all the work I've been doing the past 2 (going to be 4) weeks. Not to mention I've only gotten 120 euro of that money since I've been here. So I'm still owed 140. I have no idea what to do.

I feel like I'm being robbed and short changed in every sense. I feel like I should be compensated for the extra time I'm putting into the job when my host mom isn't around. Not to mention the fact that these kids are old enough to take care of themselves, yet they can't seem to do a simple task like heating up the oven for me when I'm running around like a chicken with it's head cut off so I can get dinner on the table.

I'm sorry. This is a rant. And a plea for advice. I'm so non-confrontational. But this e-mail has literally brought me to tears. I can't do another 2 (though I feel like it's going to be 3, due to a previous conversation with my host mom) weeks of this. I'm barely making any money, I don't have health insurance in case something happens to me while I'm here, and I'm still not legally allowed to be here. I'm so tired, angry, defeated, sad, and plain old lonely. I really could use some advice."	t5_2qt49	True

After reading that article and finding out that the neo-nazis attacked immigrants, I'm even more unsure of whether I should choose Berlin as my study abroad destination.

Being Asian American, I've encountered a lot of in-your-face racism all over Europe. I've experienced it in England, Spain and also France but I wonder if Berlin, Germany has it worse than the other places cities/countries in Europe I've been to. My study abroad application is actually due next week and I'm going through my UC (University of California) educational program so I kind of need to figure this out quickly. I want to be able to enjoy Berlin safely and be able to walk the streets at night or go clubbing without getting jumped. What're your thoughts/opinions or wisdom regarding Berlin?""

I've been in Berlin for a month now, and when I first arrived I was staying at a temporary place in Friedrichshain (crashing in someone's room while they were on holiday).  As you lovely German folks love to include lots of documentation with your job applications, I put in a request for my University in New Zealand to send a copy of my official transcript to that address.

I'd been wondering why it still hadn't arrived (I've been messaging the guy whose room I was staying in) when it occurred to me - you don't use apartment numbers here in Berlin, and my name's not on the letterbox because I didn't actually live there!  D'oh!

So my question is: where is my letter now?  Does anyone know what happens to mail in these circumstances?

1. Would it be returned to sender (in NZ)?
2. Would it be held at a nearby post office?
3. Would it be sitting on top of the building's post boxes?
4. Something else I'm not thinking of?

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I had to pay a chunk of cash for the transcript to be sent.  My thanks in advance!

I have to travel a lot for work and I need someone to help look after my dog when Im away. I already have a great daily dog walker, but I need someone who can look after her when I must leave town. She is a black lab, 12 years old.

Its a bit complicated:

* She is very old, takes daily meds and can't handle stairs

* She doesn't get along with other dogs


She is also very, very well behaved. 

* Completely house trained, no barking, no whining, no digging, no incessant licking, no bad habits

* Sleeps about 19 hours a day

* Doesn't want a lot of exercise

* Incredibly sweet and mellow

* Zero desire to escape or run away

Does anyone know of anyone who wants a part-time doggie friend? 

I occasionally take her to the Doggie Hotel, but its incredibly expensive, very inconvenient and she doesn't like it so much. I would love to have her stay with a nice person and get some personal attention when I'm gone. Of course Ill pay.

But I must add:

Please only reliable, responsible, patient, dog-loving people.

3.  Is a mobile phone a good idea just for a month? My american phone won't work (no sim card) so i'd have to get a pay-as-you-go or something. I won't have consistent phone access where I'm staying, but if it isn't worth it, I won't do it. 

4. What's the weather like in May?  I'm from the midwest and I'm assuming it's kind of the same, but is there anything special I should know?

I have a job and the German is going ok but nothing concrete as far as housing is concerned. Competition for WG rooms is fierce around here. Despite the 15 + daily messages sent on WG Gesucht and the Besichtigungen I've had or am scheduled for, I will still need someone to put me up for at least a couple of days. 

My girlfriend's place is getting less and less livable and I'm afraid of endangering my relationship if I don't move out asap

So if you feel like you can put up with a French guy with a knack for food (Im vegetarian but hey ill still cook u a steak) and interesting conversations, you'd be doing me a huge favor

I can send you links to my fb and couchsurfing profile via PM if you are interested

I often find myself shaking my head reading some posts on /r/berlinsocialclub for example, or just listening to people on the street, because I do think that in a certain way, that is exactly what this city is becoming: a big night club. I see so many posts about partying and beer and it's not like I am against it (not at all), it just feels so ""empty"" and boring and meh...

Was great to get such a positive reaction when I posted about this before! Hope to see some of you guys at one of the nights. 

Deatils as follows :)
	
TWO NIGHT RUN - FRIDAY AND SATURDAY - 20TH AND 21ST JULY

BOTH NIGHTS: DOORS AT 20:00, SHOW AT 22:00

STAY AFTER AND PARTY AT RENATE!

An amazing open-air show in the garden and after-party all for the normal entry fee to the club.

Pre-order and get your name on the list here!: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/258515

While they remain we will also be selling tickets on the door.

If possible, we would encourage people to reserve their ticket ahead of time, as this will help with the pre-production costs of the show!

Kiez Oper in association with Vignette Productions and the team at the amazing Salon - Zur wilden Renate will be bringing you something completely unique. Opera where you least expect it and for everyone!

The audience will experience an hour long performance of Dido &amp; Aeneas (In its original English by baroque composer Henry Purcell) with a new twist in not just the location, price and crowd but also the piece itself. It is going to be post-apolocalyptic, untraditional and like nothing you have seen before. Not just performers on a stage, they will be coming at you from all angles and from all parts of the space!

The main parts will be performed by members of the prestigious International Studio at the Berlin Staatsoper! With other singers sourced from around Berlin and backed by a full Baroque ensemble and staged by one of Britain's most exciting young directors who is the founder of Vignette Productions.

We feel like this will be one of the most exciting and coolest projects happening this summer in Berlin. We hope to see you there!

So one thing I've wanted to do since coming to Berlin is drive a BMW down the Autobahn. It's not a problem to rent a car; age &amp; license are no obstacles (23 &amp; I've been driving since I was about 15). However, the problem is that I've never driven with a manual transmission before. I could make it easy on myself &amp; rent an automatic, but where's the fun in that? Plus, learning how to drive a manual could be a handy skill to have. 

I've been in Berlin for about 4 months, and my license is supposed to be valid for up for 6 months after my arrival before having to get a German license (I can also apply for a 6-month extension after the initial 6 months, but I don't want to risk it).

I'll have to move to Italy for the next six months for a job.

I'm leaving the apartment I live in (75 mq; 2 rooms plus kitchen) to a friend of mine (who will only get in at the end of August, so for one month you'll have the whole thing for yourself at the price of a room).

The apartment is furnished (ikea) and has a pretty old washing machine that kinda works (you can throw it out if you want); it's in the Flughafenstr., 1 1/2 minutes walk from a U7 (Rathaus Neukölln) and a U8 (Boddinstr.) station. 

I wouldn't say the apartment itself is great, but it's definitely bearable and in the middle of a very lively part of town close to any facility you might need (in a 3 min range: library; four supermarkets; one great japanese restaurant; one decent japanese restaurant; four cool record stores; two hipsterish record stores; lots of electronics shops; two cool cinemas (one with movies in English); one crappy cinema; some bookstores; various clubs).

I will also leave a huge monitor, a decent printer and an horrible turntable.

The other guy studies CompSci, likes anime, is German, speaks a decent english, looks cute, plays TF2 and knows when the narwahl bacons. You'll probably make friends.

The price for a room, 300€, includes:

* Hot/cold water;
* Electricity;
* Fast interwebs (decent-ish belkin wi-fi router already installed and configured).

In case you are two people who want to share a room, the price would be 350€ tot. - but please be very close friends, an eternally loving couple or people with college dorm experience, since sharing a room might be stressful and I'd rather not have homicides in my house when I'm away.

He told me that the company (which was a subsidiary for a large, very very famous game-related company) was dissolved and he lost his job at the main company. He didn't know if I could get my pay.

As I think you can realize, I'm pretty fucking pissed. I'm owed 1200 euro in back-pay (1600 if this month is counted), and do not have the slightest idea how to go about getting this. I do have a legal contract which is registered with the Arbeitsamt here in Berlin, but my German is less than perfect for bureaucratic nightmares, and I am not well versed in German law.

Is there something in between?   We don't mind waiting weeks or a month to get it.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: these machines are pretty tricked out - total costs would be about €4000 to replicate both machines.  In particular, Mac desktops are really quite expensive in Europe...

I am currently looking for a room in a shared flat and I was wondering if any of you had leads? I keep browsing WG Gesucht and sending messages and I figured it might be worth trying my luck here. If this is innapropriate (browsed the FAQ and it doesnt seem so) feel free to delete my post ;) 

Anyway, I'm French, 24, working in a café and on my German. I'm staying with my girlfriend at the moment but since she lives with her folks this is no long term option. My plan is to take a German exam and ultimately study here. Ich kann schon Deutsch aber nicht perfekt, also mit Deutschen wohnen wäre echt cool. 

I'm quite relaxed, open minded and active, I do spend quite some time reading and informing myself, I enjoy the occasional banter over a fresh pint of beer as much as the next guy and I'm also a half decent cook. I'm also a vegetarian so no bacon but I don't mind it being consumed around me. Same goes for smoke. 

So if you know of anything, if one of your friends is desperately looking for a new flatmate please let me know.

I am an American moving to Berlin for an indefinite amount of time (at least one year) in September. Over the last couple weeks I've sent out little over a dozen messages to people posting vacancies on WG-Gesucht, but I have yet to hear any response from a single person, except for one sending a message that his post was an error. I've double and triple checked that my correct email is attached to these messages. Is it typical that I wouldn't hear back from somebody at all if they're not interested, or could I unwittingly be putting them off in some way? Are Berliners just reluctant about renting to Americans?

I write my messages in admittedly imperfect German if they do not post any language preference, but if I see that English is spoken in the flat then I write a small introduction in German, then proceed to English for the majority of my message (it is vastly less arduous for me, at the moment). I've always said I'm interested in meeting via skype if they'd like to have a real conversation.

If anybody has advice that they think could help, or knows a good alternative flat-search site that isn't listed in the FAQ, please let me know! Anything is appreciated, I certainly don't want my one-way plane ticket to lead to homelessness!

The company for which I work here in San Francisco has offered me a position at the Berlin office. I'd love to be able to take it. But, the company insists I first obtain a work permit before they issue a contract.

So, I go to the consulate here in San Francisco. The consulate insists I obtain a work contract before they issue a permit!

This is a real Catch-22 and I don't know what to do. I'm wondering if anyone out there has any suggestions.

I won't be moving before October if this all works out. So, there is some time. But, I really do need to get the ball rolling now.

Thank you to anyone who can help. I promise delights from San Francisco to anyone in Berlin who can help!

UPDATE:
I'm sorry to report I've made no progress. My company refuses to offer any assistance: no ""unsigned contract,"" no ""letter of intent."" I'm on my own and a bit concerned that if I pester them any more the offer will be withdrawn.

- vegan anarchists (we know of a few vegan cafes, vegan supermarket and vegan sex shop that we will check out, but not much on the anarchist scene - perhaps an anarchist infoshop or community?)

- love attending live music gigs - ska, rock, folk, punk, good electro etc - genre is less important that quality of experience.

- we are polyamorous and kinky - so sex museums, fetish events etc would be fun to include in our trip

- we have tattoos and wouldn't be averse to getting some tattoo work done, or checking out highly recommended tattoo studios

- would love to meet some anarchists, vegans, polyamorists or otherwise similar minded people

- i really loved all the graffitti that decorates Berlin - if anyone has some street art that we simply MUST see, please let me know the location so we can check it out :-)

I've recently started biking more. Every day I try to bike about 30 km before work. While Berlin is indeed very bicycle friendly, it's actually not so long ride bicycle friendly for two reasons: (1) lots of stopping, (2) even the dedicated bike paths are often extremely bumpy. i've had an innertube pop last week, and it's somewhat annoying that the bike paths aren't paved over smooth, and are instead tiled. i'm not sure why they would choose that.

anyway my question is if anyone knows good long-ride biking paths. I live in P-berg and my work is in Mitte, so at the moment what I do is go to brandenberg gate and just ride west on unter de linden for about 15 km, going through charlottenberg. after leaving charlottenberg it's quite nice as you go on these wide side-roads next to the highway that are totally paved. if there was a long stretch like that that would be great.

I'm in my 20's, and currently working here in Berlin for a sports team. The job is fine, but it's not what I'm wanting to be doing for the foreseeable future and I feel I'm at a crossroads where I've still got time to pursue a career in something I really want to do.

I work EXTREMELY hard, normally 6 days a week doing some important work for the team dealing with filming and editing things, motivational videos, research, being in charge of expensive electrical equipment and other things - I don't want to go into too much detail so as to not be identifiable by anyone happening across this post.

Anyway, on top of this I'm really badly paid - less than 1000 euros netto a month, after almost 3 years of work. There's been talk of a pay rise but it's not been forthcoming, and I feel that I make so little money that I can afford to begin at the bottom of the ladder in another career direction.

I'm looking to find ANY jobs in a media environment - literally anything. PA, Runner, Grip - anything. I just want my foot in the door, whether it's a small company or the largest here, I just want my foot in the door. I've looked at some job-listing sites and it just seems impossibly difficult to get the foot in the door whatsoever - all jobs requiring years of experience before they'll even look at the CV or resume.

Can anyone give me any general advice on how to change my career towards something like this? I say change, I'm dealing with video every single day so it's not SO much of a change, just not in sport. There's a lot of no-paid jobs, but I couldn't leave my current job, however badly paid it is, to move onto something with no pay whatsoever.

I found vast amounts of 8mm film rolls in my late grandfathers attic. I'm talking 70-odd rolls from the thirties (45 of them), fifties, sixties and seventies. This happened in Italy. Now I'm back in Berlin and brought a few of of them with me. I also found two 35 mm rolls, but I left them in Italy. The films contain everything from family moments, to recordings of New York, New Orleans and China in the Thirties and an education film for Greek soldiers in the 2nd World War.

Since converting these films to digital is too expensive for my student's budget, I'm curious if anyone of you owns a 8mm projector that he could kindly put at my disposal. I'd like to watch the material before I decide what to convert. Or maybe some of you know a place where I can watch them. I have only a couple of rolls with me now, but I would pick up the rest in a couple of months.

Am 24. September 2011 startet die 3. Silent Climate Parade - dieses Jahr werden mehr als 1500 Teilnehmer erwartet, die mit Kopfhörern bestückt leise durch Berlin tanzen um die Erneuerbare Zukunft zu beschleunigen! Dazu gibt's feinste Musik von unseren DJs, mit toller Unterstützung aus der Bar25 Ecke::

- Blenn and Gleich 
- Slurm 
- Beaner (ICH/ME)
- Pilocka Krach 
- Sven Dohse 

auf dem Silent-Climate-Elektromobil - alles wie gewohnt (fast) emissionsfrei und mit Ökostrom angetrieben!

Zum weltweiten 'Moving Planet' Klima-Aktionstag möchten wir zeigen, dass eine klimagerechte Welt auch Spaß machen kann, ja wahrscheinlich sogar Spaß machen muss! Es geht nicht nur um Verzicht, sondern darum, eine erneuerbare Zukunft zu gestalten. Kreativ zu sein. Gemeinsam Neues zu erleben. Zum Beispiel auch mit einer anderen Art der Demonstration, eine die Menschen anders als gewohnt anspricht und vielleicht auch ein wenig im Herzen berührt.

Hunderttausende Menschen in aller Welt beteiligen sich an 'Moving Planet' Aktionen, und Berlin wird einer der internationalen Fokuspunkte sein! Passanten erhalten Flyer um den Hintergrund unserer Aktion zu verstehen. Let's get moving!

Im Anschluss findet eine kurze Abschlusskundgebung am Breitscheidplatz statt - um auch den Menschen ohne Kopfhörer zu erklären, was das ganze soll.

vorläufiger Timetable:
12:00 - Kopfhörer-Ausgabe &amp; Warm-Up DJ
14:00 - Beginn der Parade
16:00 - Abschlusskundgebung am Breitscheidplatz
16:30 - Kopfhörer-Rückgabe

+++ Bitte beachtet, dass die Veranstaltung am Breitscheidplatz (nähe Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtnis-Kirche) in Charlottenburg stattfindet +++

I'm a 20 year old Irish student and rather than spend the Summer doing nothing, I've decided that I might be better off trying my luck at employment in Berlin. My German is at a decent level, but I have a few questions I'd like to ask, and I'd be very grateful to anyone willing to answer them.

As I won't be staying longer than 90 days, I'm aware that I won't need a work permit for employment, but do I require a residence permit? If so, how do I obtain it and how long does the process take?

I'll be traveling on my own and so my best bet for accommodation would seem to be a flat share (like the ones on wg-gesucht.de). Though there appears to be no shortage of advertisements, I'm told that it can be quite hard to find such accommodation. Is this so? Also, what sort of documentation, if any, is generally required to apply for a place in a flat share? 

Thirdly, what are my best chances of getting a job for the Summer period? I've sent a barrage of e-mails to hostels, pubs, beergardens, etc. but I've got nothing guaranteed as of yet. Would I be likely to find employment by sticking my head in the doors of various businesses and handing out CVs?

I have a couple of questions and if you want to spare some of your time to answer them, I'll be as happy as a kid on Christmas morning. 

I'm trying to find a place to stay, or more exactly a room. I'm very late with this, I know, but I didn't know if I was accepted to the studies I've applied for (starts in the beginning of June) until a couple days ago. 
I've been looking around on http://www.wg-gesucht.de/ and just want some guidelines to avoid getting into a situation where I pay too much for a room because I'm the naive lost foreigner. 
What is a reasonable price for a room (10-20m²) and which areas do you recommend? Is it a huge problem that I don't speak german?
Also, is there anything else I should think about to make my hunt a little bit easier?

The few times I've visited Berlin I've noticed - to my great joy - that it's bike friendly like hell. So, where do I find a cheap bike to be able cruise around the city like a boss?

Being a big sucker for hanging out in laid back bars bullshitting with regulars and strangers, I need to find a place like that. Even bigger plus if the beer selection is broad (this seems to be almost impossible in Berlin though)

In less than a week, I will be moving to your city to live and work.   I have lived and worked in Berlin before and had a wonderful time.   While I was in Berlin, I made a point to try many breweries and many beers, because I love all types. Some of my favorites were Bräuhaus Lemke, Bräuhaus Mitte, Eschenbräu, and Bräuhaus Südstern.  I am a big fan of all types of beer, except for what the type they call ""piss water"".

Now to the point.  I love making beer.  I used to home brew my own, but I am moving away.  In addition to working and living in Berlin, I would like to volunteer at a Brewery or find an apprenticeship, so I can learn industrial brewing as well as practice my german (as a bonus).  If anybody has a lead on how to do this (besides just going and asking), that would be most excellent.  

Thank you kindly."	t5_2qt49	True

1364639850.0	1baoz7	Road bike stolen, berlin redditors can you help?	curioushipster	12	6	8	"My faithful road bike has been stolen on Thursday evening just before 7pm in the Haubachstrasse in Charlottenburg. This is not ideal for me because I used it to go to work (altogether 80-100 km a week) and cycling is very important to me to relieve stress. Anyway after reading all those success stories about the recovery of stolen bikes in densely reddited areas I thought I might give it a go and ask for a heads up in case anyone spots my bike.

The description: it is a black bike of the German brand Canyon (there are not too many of those around). When it was stolen it had triathlon aerobars mounted on top of the standard road handlebars. The complete group (brakes and gears) is Shimano Dura Ace. It has road bike pedals (Shimano) and two bottle holders mounted. It looks a lot like [this one](http://fstatic1.rennrad-news.de/img/photos/9/9/2/8/_/large/SDC11613.JPG) but with almost no stickers (the 'Canyon' sticker is there though) and with aerobars and an extra bottle holder mounted (at least when it was stolen). I will link to pictures of the actual bike as soon as I find them. I have the frame number and I went to the police straight away on Thursday night, so if I find it there will not be any problems in recovering it.

If you spot it somewhere it'd be lovely if you could PM me and tell me about it, maybe together with a picture.

**TL,DR: if you spot or are offered to buy a black 'Canyon' road bike with dura ace group please give me a shout.**

Many thanks for your help.
