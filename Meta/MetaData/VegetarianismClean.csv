Though 'Lyfe' (a healthy fast food restaurant, in short) is being born out on the west coast, with plans for expansion, there is still an open market for a healthy/wholesome vegetarian eatery in the food chain business. (I imagine a place of the same stature as Panera/Applebee's, but will be committed to healthy/wholesome vegetarian food, even if the prices have to be a bit more expensive than traditional restaurant prices). Imagine a Whole Foods dining experience, but with more of a theme/vibe, perhaps. Also, it wouldn't have to be advertised as a ""vegetarian place"", as much as it could be advertised (I know I keep repeating the terms) as a healthy/wholesome eatery. I say this because it seems people are more health conscious than ever, but still resistant to a healthy vegetarian lifestyle.

A notable one is when I was with my best friend and her sister. My friend (who is supportive) asked me how my vegetarianism was going and her sister was asking the usual questions (where do you get your protein, what about fish, ect). Her sister seemed mildly curious about it but seemed not to really care. Then when my friend expressed interest in trying to be a vegetarian, her sister blew up. She went on and on about how it's bad for you and how they're always getting sick and how we're meant to eat meat all while I was sitting there listening. This wasn't the first time and i doubt last, that someone became angry and offended after hearing I don't eat meat. So why? this isn't meant to be a circle jerk type of post. I am genuinely confused as to why.	t5_2qhzr	True

I'm a massive Guinness drinker. I'm also a pescetarian. It recently came to my attention that Guinness is not vegetarian, and that it has something along the lines of fish extracts in its recipe. Although I occasionally do eat fish, I intend to eventually cut it out completely, so this pissed me off. As a result, I thought I'd start a project: Starting from today, for the next month I am on a mission to find at least one article every day pertaining to the rise of vegetarianism. Then in March I will send them all (highlighted and noted) along with a letter to the Guinness asking them to consider creating a vegetarian option of some sort. I realise that my efforts will more than likely be ignored, but I'd at least like to try. I thought maybe I would get a few people I know to sign the back of the letter to show support. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in getting involved in this?"	t5_2qhzr	True

I decided to become vegetarian because I was tired of just talking about factory farming and their horrible standards. I wanted to make a difference. When I made the change, I was living in a small country town in Oregon and didn't know any other veggies. Everyone thought I was crazy and wasting my time. I decided right away that I wasn't going to push my beliefs on anyone, but wanted to be an excellent source of information to those with questions. Because of this friendly approach I have been able to get my little brother to completely give up meat( he's four years deep now) and have been able to get both my parents, my bf, roommate and several friends to cut back to only eating meat a couple times a week. I'm very pleased with this and was wondering if anyone else feels like their vegetarianism has had an impact on their friends and family?	t5_2qhzr	True

I am not trying to start anything, but I just want an honest opinion. I consider vegetarianism to be hard work (not as hard as veganism) but still hard work.

What the fuck can I do about this? Anything really quick? I'm going for a for hour bus drive tomorrow, and even though there are toilets on the bus, I'd like to avoid using them (they are disgusting).

1344755235.0	y337u	Why do people think it is so 'ok' to make fun of us, and how do you defend yourselves?	prometheus5500	42	7	89	"I'm getting so sick of this. I do not EVER give anyone shit for eating meat. I am a harmless, terribly nice person. Don't get me wrong, I can have a sharp tongue, but I try to bite it and be the bigger person.  
  
However, I'm over it. EVERY meal, I have to take shit from the people around me. Yes I know, find some new people, but I'm talking about people I will never ditch. Close family. I've repeatedly told them I'm sick of it, that it was never funny, and if they will ever get over it. They all say 'no, I'll probably make fun of you so long as you're vegetarian'.  
  
So, my two questions more specifically:  
  
1. Why do people think it is 'ok' to make fun of us, even though (in this case) I have clearly defined why I am vegetarian and explained that it is frustrating that each meal comes with insults and laughs?  
  
2. How do you defend yourselves and get them to STFU? What quick witted responses have you guys used that were most effective?  
  
Thank you guys, keep being the good people you are!  
  
  
P.S.: I have read a few other posts (I did indeed search around a bit before posting this) and have found some information. It was, however, not quite what I was looking for and would simply like to start this more highly focused discussion.

For some background, I gave up land based meat almost six months ago and it was a tremendous change for me, but certainly worthwhile. I feel healthier and more comfortable with what I put into my body. It was something that was a long time coming, but after I read a couple books about America's food culture and the corporatization of America's agriculture industry, it became impossible for me to ignore.  (yes, I get it is a bit hypocritical of me to go after agriculture while being a participant in the military industrial complex.) I understand that given the lifestyle I live and the time/monetary limitations I face, I can't be a 100% organic, local, small farm consumer, but I do try. I believe in trying to minimize my impact on the earth, not inflicting harm (including animals), living sustainably, and trying to help others. Some of the ideals of vegetarianism helped me decide I wanted to become a MEDEVAC pilot rather than some other specialty.

Anyway, the point of this post is to crowd source some assistance. As you might know, the Army has certain physical fitness standards. I am still recovering from a hernia repair (developed in training) that has made my recovery a long process. I was wondering what the vegetarian athletes and workout warriors of reddit might suggest in helping me get the proteins and nutrients I need to maintain the active lifestyle the Army demands.

As of now, I eat way too much cheese and carbs just because that has been what is simple. It has been too easy to get busy at work and just run to the Taco Bell for some bean burritos. I'm ready to work harder to do this right. Any ideas of easy meals to make or meals I can bring to work would be appreciated. It would also be nice to hear what vegetarian foods are out there that I should avoid because they aren't healthy. My girlfriend, who is a long distance runner, has been incredibly supportive and has used her prodigious skills in cooking vegetarian meals to keep me at least marginally healthy. I was hoping y'all might have some advice on how to help me turn eating from a stressful experience back into a fun one!

Thanks for whatever advice y'all might have!

EDIT: I also have to travel a decent bit. If anyone has any advice for foods I can make that travel well or restaurants/fast food I can eat at while I'm on the road, I would love you forever."	t5_2qhzr	True

Every Friday is now Vegan Friday for me; one day of the week that I eat vegan. I chose Friday to eat vegan because it is a nice way to ease into the weekend, especially considering junk food, alcohol, etc tends to sneak its way onto plates over the weekend when spending time with friends, going to bars, out to eat, etc. Just in the 2 months that I've implemented this in my life, I have learned SO much about eating vegan and alternative food options. I know it isn't as big of a deal as fully committing to veganism, but it is a small step that makes me feel good.	t5_2qhzr	True

I then got married to a great guy who is from a rural farming area, but... his parents are turkey and pig farmers.

I want to cut meat out of my diet again for moral reasons. Getting my husband to go along with meatless cooking isnt really a difficult battle, but I'm really afraid of what my in-laws (and that entire community) would think- probably along the lines of ""you've lost your damn mind."" They can be very, very harsh. I know that I should really just suck it up and hold my ground, but these people are with me for the rest of my life, and I don't want to offend their livelihood (they don't really even know how much I disagree with factory farming to begin with). Then when we have kids, if they're mostly vegetarian, I can't imagine the comments we'll get. Add this to being politically liberal and atheist in a conservative Christian environment.... this is the cherry on the cake. 

I also feel like an enormous hypocrite because we accepted their financial assistance here and there during college- that money came directly from something that I really disagree with, since they aren't free-range farmers. 

Does anybody have any advice? Tips? Experience?  Can anybody help me think of ways to make it less awkward to go visit them if I go back to vegetarianism? I think I'd still eat fish occasionally, so I was thinking that maybe I could bring individually packaged fish or like a portobello mushroom to cook when everybody else is eating beef, pork, etc. 

Tl;dr- want to be a vegetarian again, but husband's family members are pig and turkey farmers, this makes me feel awkward and hypocritical.

BatwingDarling	37	4	34	"I know that many vegetarians like to cook at home, which is, of course, the easiest way to make sure you're getting vegetarian options. I make most of my meals at home too, but occasionally it's nice to go out to dinner. However, even as an omnivore who is trying to cut most of the meat out of my diet, often it can be hard to find a satisfying vegetarian option at most restaurants unless you get a salad and usually have to ask them to omit the meat, or get stuck eating appetizers. So when you do, what do you like to get, and where? 

So, what are your favorite choices?  

I'll start with some of mine: 

-Quesadilla explosion salad at Chili's, without the chicken. 

-Cheese veggie sandwich at Five Guys (basically a cheeseburger minus the beef patty.)

-Friendly's has the option of a veggie patty instead of beef for any of their burgers, so pretty much any of those.

Hello, fellow vegetarians, vegans and curious onmivores. If you live in the U.S., you may find the fact that animal rights are hardly mentioned in policy debates or the political arena a seriously disturbing one. I think animal rights are an important matter which ought to be put on the national agenda, and chances are that you believe they are at least worth mentioning. If I get 150 signatures, this petition will go public, meaning that anyone visiting whitehouse.gov can see it and sign it. If I get 25,000 signatures by November 5th of this year, our petition will automatically be reviewed by a group of Secretaries, the head bureaucrats and members of Obama's cabinet, for consideration. 

This petition has the potential to make a big difference, and I would love for you to support me.

For those who don't want to click the link, here is the petition in its completeness:

**Make the meat industry more humane by introducing stricter regulations and greater oversight**

*Upon the recognition that some animals feel pain and are capable of suffering, it follows that they impose legitimate moral obligations on us which ought to be respected. There currently is little room in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO's) for the kind of humaneness which is owed to the animals bred therein.*

*Although regulations exist regarding the operations of CAFO's, the animals bred in such operations are too often sufferers of wanton cruelty by inefficient methods of slaughter, overcrowding and disease. Regulations that are in place tend to be dodged, difficult to enforce, or unenforceable.*

*I urge the government to ensure compliance with current regulation and to implement further measures to reduce the wanton cruelties of CAFO's.*"	t5_2qhzr	True

http://www.reddit.com/r/Vegetarianism/comments/ndegh/hi_rvegetarianism_im_having_one_of_you_guys_move/

So after coming to you guys for advice, here's the progress.

1. We mainly eat vegetarian food in this house, bar the odd pork sausage and chicken fillet steak I'm prone to cooking.
2. I've lost 15kg from eating healthier, down from 90kg to 75kg.
3. My girlfriend has also lot a heap of weight, but won't divulge and tell me how much.
4. My housemate is also a avid bike rider, that helps too!
5. I've quit smoking!
6. Our favourites are tofu tacos/burritos and lentil burgers.

One more thing, vegetarian sausages are gross and should not exist ever.

Thanks for your words 6 months ago guys, I feel like gold!"	t5_2qhzr	True

It got me thinking about being a vegetarian in general. At the moment my diet is a balance of fruits, vegetables and proteins like chicken, fish and red meat. To gain some perspective of vegetarians, and to see the effect it will have on my body I have decided to try out a vegetarian diet for the week. What I hope to get out of it is to at least incorporate 3-4 vegetarian meals in my life outside this week, at the very least.

Can anyone offer some tips or tricks I need to know? It would be really appreciated. 

As a side question, are people like me looked down on in the vegetarian community? as if i'm a ""part-time vego"" and it's horrible? No ill feelings, just curious.

Instead of going through the trouble of telling my family I'm vegetarian and trying to force them to conform to my lifestyle (which would be a dickish move) I want to bring something to the get-together that I would like to eat and that they might enjoy as well.

I was wondering if anyone had a decent recipes for veggie noodles to replace turkey-n-noodles, as that was always my favorite (especially on top of mashed potatoes), but any recipe ideas are welcome.

1278640033.0	cniyl	Vegetarian girlfriend	bashobt	33	8	33	"I have been seeing a girl for sometime now who is a vegetarian. Initially I was indifferent to the whole matter since she doesn't care if I eat meat or not and you can get vegetarian food at just about any restaurant in the world. 

When she came over I would cook the artificial meat and eat it with her, but I got extremely tired of that morningstar crap and those garden burgers, I mean that stuff has more chemicals in it than a university college laboratory.

So I started looking at websites like allrecipes/vegetarian and began to discover some of the most delicious and (sometimes)healthy food I had ever had. My roommate and I love to eat pork, beef, chicken, lamb, duck, turkey, you name it. But when my girlfriend comes over and I cook those vegetarian recipes for all of us, it just so happens that I don't miss the meat at all. 

Of course my roommate complains as I'm cooking: 

Him: Could you add some meat?
Me: No.
Him: How about make mine separately and add meat to it?
Me: No.
Him: I hate you
Me: No.

Afterwards he always says: damn dude that was tasty, but it could be better with meat. 

Ha. I think the biggest mental block I had about eating vegetarian is picturing a life of munching on salad, which I hate, and celery, which i hate even more, all the time.  

I'm not a convert by any means, but I could see myself eating vegetarian food with my woman all the time and it wouldn't even occur to meat that a dietary staple was being left out. (thats a joke)

None of the recipes are complicated at all with weird gluten ingredients or shit like that, and most of the ones I have made are fucking outstanding. 

Here in order are the 3 absolute most delicious ones I have had and if you do attempt to make it off [allrecipes vegetarian section](http://allrecipes.com//Recipes/everyday-cooking/vegetarian/Main.aspx) read the upvoted comments for great tips.

Pokemen	26	3	3	"Over the past year or so, there have been many ""Tumblr spam rings"" here on reddit, with probably nearing a thousand+ accounts spamming links to a number of tumblr accounts. [Evidence A](http://www.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/search?q=tumblr&amp;restrict_sr=on) 

The reddit accounts usually look like they were created by smashing your face on the keyboard (e.g. ""lpsodfs"" ""xbviuer"" ""likefw"") and will only have one submission. If you are unsure whether an account is part of the spam ring, you can [click on the domain](http://i.imgur.com/uVVyA.jpg) at the end of the submission title, and you'll [see everyone who has submitted a link to the same domain](http://www.reddit.com/domain/brantdnc.tumblr.com/). If all the other usernames are gibberish and each account has only posted that single submission, it's safe to say it is spam.

While I'm usually pretty good about looking at the new submissions of the subreddits I mod, I do sometimes miss things, so I am asking that if you happen to see a spam post, to please report it. If you don't know how, you can do so by clicking the ""report"" link under the submission so it gets sent to my modque. If it is indeed a spam account, I'll deal with it. If it's just someone innocently sharing a post from Tumblr, then I'll just mark the post as being fine. 

You can also report the user as a spammer. If you use RES, you can do this very quickly by [pressing the ""spam"" link under the submission](http://i.imgur.com/si76a.jpg). If you don't, you can copy the URL of the userpage, then go to [/r/reportthespammers](/r/reportthespammers) and submit the link.

I know that he can be healthy without meat, as long as i am careful about his diet, but it's not really a logical thing for my partner. I think he wants his son to eat meat so he can share his culture/cuisine with him. Before he was born, i compromised and said that if my partner  prepared the meat for him, he could feed it to him. But my partner started asking if we can buy chicken and veg baby foods, and...  the idea just makes me really uncomfortable. I feel like it is too early to introduce meat, and if he has to eat it, I certainly don't want it to be factory farmed, processed chicken in a little jar.

I tried Vegusto's products this week and I am amazed at how good they are. They're a little expensive compared to the real thing but they're fantastic and I'm happy to pay the prices. They are wheat based and the flavours are very close to the originals.

I got a bronze starter pack thing which contains 1 normal cheese, 2 melting cheeses, 2 sausages, 2 burgers and 2 packs of sliced meats. I've now tried it all and can report back on it.

The basic cheese is fantastic. I can't tell the difference between it and normal cheddar cheese except it doesn't coat your mouth the same way, which was never something I enjoyed. The flavour is perfect and I would happily serve this to dairy eaters as well as non-dairy eaters. I doubt people would know it wasn't the real thing when on a nice cracker.


The melting cheese is very similar but has a slightly looser texture. It tastes the same but struggles when you melt it. Normal cheese's flavour changes slightly to go a bit milder when used, this stuff doesn't go milder.  Its usable but you would have to adjust quantity to get the flavours you're looking for.

The Sausages are great. They have the texture of a hotdog sauce and feel meaty to bite into. The flavour is some where between a hot dog sausage and pepperoni. Its not my prefered meaty flavour but it satisfies that meaty craving you have and would be great in oven bakes. The very mild spiciness to them would be fantastic in a pasta sauce or similarly styled bake. In fact while writing this I now regret eating them all as I want it for dinner tonight.

The burgers are the worst of what I've tried. They're not bad, but they aren't burgers in the same way I would like. In Scotland there is a type of sausage called fruit pudding, which is black pudding's fruit and bloodless sister in texture and flavour. And its very good, but it isn't a burger, and these lean very much towards a fruit pudding texture and a slight hint of that flavour. They're not bad and I'd happily munch on one at a barbeque or whatever, but you couldn't trick any one with one of these and the real thing. Worth a try but I wouldn't buy more of them.

The slices of meat are awesome. They send you two different flavours in the starter pack and they look disgusting in the wrapping. They look half melted and just.. I'll pass. But the taste of them is really good. They're close to a luncheon meat in texture and not too far off in flavour.  One is slightly spicey (not hot, just flavoured) and goes well in sandwiches, the other is just flat out luncheon meat in every way and you can use it in the same way. Another one I'd be happy to give to someone to compare to the original and think would be impossible to pick between.


Overall I found Vegusto stuff to be fantastic and something I will be adding as a staple to my diet. I've already ordered some more stuff from them before I've polished off what I have here. If you're in the UK or have a way to get it to you, I couldn't recommend trying them highly enough. My only complaint is that they didn't return my message on Twitter, which isn't related to the quality of the foods at all."	t5_2qhzr	True

I have a lot of digestive problems, and I find anytime I eat meat/meat products its at its worse. So I'm trying something new and am working to slowly cut out meat from my diet. This isn't a huge deal, since I hardly eat meat to begin with, or I usually 'eat around' the meat if its in meals. I started my no meat quest about 3 days ago now, and so far I've had no issues after meals (which is a big change).

I was wondering if someone could kinda give me a list of staples that are handy to have around the house, or some favourite go to meals/recipes/sites. I am a student, so cash is a bit tight.

As well as any other pieces of advice or tips would be cool too :)

thanks!

My name is Downvotedandy, and I used to be an omnivore. 

My want to switch to a vegetarian diet has been a slow creeping process. I want to preface this by saying that I loved meat, chicken, fish, eggs etc.

My journey to becoming a vegetarian:

I have  been having horrible experiences with animal proteins lately. 

Here are some examples:

* made sunny side up eggs, and after became horribly sick, I think they may have been past due, or something in mind clicked when I looked at the yellow yolks. I have had eggs again but only the whites in an omelette.

* never was a big fan of milk or diary products, but lately have been extremely sensitive to milk, cottage cheese, ice cream to the point that I don't want it, because it makes me sick. I can though enjoy yogurt, hard cheeses.

* I bought a chicken to roast, from a store I usually shop at, and both myself and fiancé were sick after. He's been able to eat chicken, I on the other hand cannot stomach the thought after the incident.

* Bought minced/ground pork, and it was just rotten, foul and sour smelling. At first I thought maybe it was suppose to smell that way ( I buy some of my meat at an Asian meat/fish market, and sometime their pork smells slightly different from what you buy a at a mainstream grocery store, but I've never had a problem before.

**So here's the TL;DR**

A series of unfortunate events regarding meat and diary products have me nauseous at the thought of any meat, fish or diary products.

And here's the actual question:

What do I eat? How much? I don't want to give up pasta or bread. I don't eat copious amounts but I like some pasta or a piece of bread with salad sometimes.

Here's a sample of what I'll eat:

* watermelon 1/2 cup

* full fat yogurt 1/2 cup

* potato and leek soup ( homemade, no milk, made on water not stock) with .5 tablespoon of sour cream 

* sautéed red cabbage, apples, and carrots

* homemade roasted red pepper, red onion, and Parmesan pizza.

( homemade yeast crust, no cheese aside from Parmesan  and no tomato sauce) 

* endamame 1/2 cup

* peanut butter 1 tbsp

So is this a normal type menu? Am I missing something. Should I add more of something? I also have an irrational fear of gaining weight because ill be eating probably more carbs and fat than usual.

*I tried looking up full vegetable, fat no protein diet but all the searches return keto/paleo advice.*"	t5_2qhzr	True

1332945152.0	rhkf0	Is there anything in fruits we can't get from vegetables?	kaminix	20	1	5	"Hi

We've all learned from childhood that we should eat tons of fruit, and stores in Sweden often say that about 0,5 kg of fruit a day (!!!) is to recommend. Most of us, especially vegetarians, also know about our evolutionary heritage as fruit eaters.

But is there anything in fruit that you won't get from eating vegetables? I tend to see fruit mostly like a really good alternative to candy (I usually try to buy fruit and nuts instead of candy... and most candy isn't vegetarian anyway), but I'm not entirely convinced about the nutritional value of it.

Clearly *it is* nutritious, but more so than vegetables? Is it not just an excuse for meat eaters to skip vegetables and eat tons of fruit instead?

From what I can gather fruits are:

* As nutritious as vegetables, but with lots of sugar (not as bad as refined, but still).
* Often acidic and thus not very good for your teeth.
* Imported from much further away than vegetables, so not very climate smart food.
* Often among the hardest to grow requiring, or at least using, a lot of chemicals and stuff to keep insects and disease away. (bananas are a good example, with average age of death being quite low among farmers... I've heard)
* Very, very tasty.

The points above are not fact, they're my conclusions from thinking a bit about this and doing some quite shallow research about the subject. **Please correct them if they're wrong.** Even if everything above is correct, I still wouldn't stop eating fruit because of point #4 (Very, very tasty), but I think it's worth keeping in mind"	t5_2qhzr	True

Yofi	23	7	26	"I feel like all the veggie guides say that the key is beans, beans, beans, but I have just never been wild about them. I feel like things get too beany for me pretty quickly, e.g. I have always avoided bean burritos, blech. However, I do find myself enjoying side dishes involving beans that are salty or spicy and not just beany and I do like a well-spiced lentil soup.

I've been a vegetarian for about a month and it's been pretty easy so far. I think I'm mostly falling back on omelettes and fried rice. I feel like I should probably get in touch with my inner bean, though, if I want to be a proper vegetarian. Besides that, I am also poor as shit and I know that beans are extremely frugal. How can I do up beans **really easily** in a way that will make them taste interesting and delicious and not just bland and beany?

I do eat meat (hold on, hold on, set down the pitchforks and torches for a minute), but I do also eat my fruits and vegetables. I try to keep a well balanced diet. I grow my own fruits, vegetables, and other things for cooking, such as spices. There's that short introduction on me.   
   
While growing up I was taught, probably incorrectly, that our bodies need some of the nutrients that are within meat. Was I taught wrong? What are the pros and cons of have a vegetarian diet (I would like to know this from a vegetarian's viewpoint to add to the research I have recently started doing)? If I were to switch my eating habits, which is better vegetarianism or veganism?

Rather than an epiphany, I underwent a sort of gradual process of questioning my eating habits. I have several vegetarian family members which I speak to about this regularly, and I've met more and more vegetarians as I get older. I've also become more concerned about my nutrition, and I've read articles/watched documentaries about vegetarianism. I'm still not quite sure what led me to make this big step, whether it be compassion for animals, a health decision, or just for experimentation.

So far it's been going well! I'm on my second week. I've been eating seafood though. I've noticed I have to get more creative with my meals, which I've heard is a common occurrence among new vegetarians. I don't mind. Here comes the downpour of questions:

Do you discriminate between the pain of a small crustacean and a large mammal? 
Do non-mammals experience less pain than mammals? 
If you were dying from hunger would you consider eating an animal? 
Is is true you won't get your vitamins/nutrients without meat? 
Any ex-vegetarians/born-again vegetarians? 
What led you to vegetarianism? 
Do you enjoy the taste of meat but hate the idea of it being dead flesh?
How do you justify ancient civilizations that hunted for meat?
Any bad experiences with your transition to vegetarianism?
Ever feel like you're limited when it comes to international food?
Ever feel like you're offending a well-meaning native when you refuse to eat a dish offered by someone in a foreign country? Do you feel limited or perhaps pretentious? Is being vegan more difficult than being vegetarian?  Aren't you still condoning animal cruelty when you consume milk and eggs? How is eating meat bad for the environment?

Thank you for any and all responses! :)

So here's some quick and easy things that I make that are vegetarian, but don't require you to completely re-think cooking and meals.

Qualifications:  I have been a vegetarian for about 13 years now.  I started out as a vegan but after a couple of years I started eating dairy again.

Sandwiches.  Just don't put the meat on.  Lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, and mayo is my default sandwich.  I like to add sprouts because then I can drizzle oil on it (the sprout matrix holds the oil in) and grind some pepper and sprinkle some salt.  Also, pickle alternatives like dilled cauliflower and roasted red peppers add some punch.  Crusty bread ties it all together.  Get take-out menus from local sandwich shops and try to re-create the veg sandwiches.

Pizza.  Buy a frozen cheese pizza and put some chopped up veggies (or whatever) and some more cheese on it.  Remember two things: adding an extra layer of veggies (or whatever) and cheese means it's going to need to cook a little longer.  Also, if you add something that has liquid like artichoke hearts, drain it well, maybe use paper towels.  The little pools of liquid keep that section of pizza from cooking as fast as the rest of it.

Baked potatoes.  Scrub 'em, stab 'em with a fork a few times, and microwave 'em until they are soft when you squeeze them.  It takes about 5 mins or so depending on your microwave and the size of your potato.  Then add butter (stir it into the potato), chopped broccoli, shredded cheddar and put it back in the mic for another min or so.  Then add sour cream, salsa, ranch, or whatever.  Actually baking the potatoes is way better but it takes at least 45 minutes.

Tacos.  Tacos are the same except you use the veggie ground “meat” instead.  However, there is a caveat.  Veggie “meat” doesn’t have the fat that liquefies during cooking.  When you mix it with the spice pack, it gets dry real fast.  Here’s what you do:  take the pan and put it under your kitchen sink faucet, turn the faucet on full blast and immediately shut it off.  Stir it in over the heat.  Add more as necessary.  The “meat” doesn’t need to cook, so it’s ready when you think it’s hot enough.  Also, the veg “meat” comes in 12 oz packages and the spice packet call for 1lb.  I sauté onions and peppers before adding it to make up for the difference.  Maybe use black beans and rice instead of the veg “meat”.  Lime, cilantro, mmm….

Pasta.  Noodles and sauce is where you start.  I augment store bought sauce by sautéing onions, garlic, peppers, etc first then adding the sauce and some herbs.  Simmer that for about 10-ish under low heat.  Top the cooked noodles with this augmented sauce and sprinkle some Italian shredded cheese blend or parmesan. 

tl;dr  It’s just easy ways for people to think about vegetarian meals when they are used to meat being the center of a meal.  Not supposed to be a “well-rounded diet”.

Well I have been considering it for a while and have finally decided to do it. I'm going Vegetarian!!! 
I know this is a considerable lifestyle change and therefore will appreciate  your help.  
For starters Ive heard a lot about people taking vitamins for iron deficiency's. Is their any foods i can eat to maintain the levels of iron i had from eating meat?
Also what foods should i look to eat and some easy meals to prepare? 
And any good ideas and tricks that you have learnt over the years would be a great help. Thanks.
Edit: Wow thank you all for the support. Another quick question, cheese and butter have always been quite common in my diet. I am not quiting dairy foods, but it would be nice to have a good alternative to butter/margarine, which i have on toast pretty much every morning. So sort off like the soy milk of butter?"	t5_2qhzr	True

1352274379.0	12sce1	Diet advice for a new vegetarian on a budget	uninformedveg	21	7	18	"I've recently decided to see how the herbivore's live partially because the meat available to me (I live at home and generally eat whatever my mother has made for dinner) is of poor quality due to low budget and partially because a good friend of mine made a good stoney argument for abstaining from the consumption of sentient life (I waited until he moved 406 miles away before making the switch out of pride).

I work generally eight hours a day and that means having to figure out what food to bring to work. I am not so good at this and in the first week of my attempt at a meatless diet I've lost 7lb (if I don't have anything to bring I usually just walk to Smart and Final on my lunch and buy fruits and nuts, but this doesn't provide me with enough nutrients I assume). This is not good for me as I am already underweight. 

Basically I need to figure out some decent meals that will help me put on some weight and keep me healthy. That's where your suggestions come in. I've been trying to search around all these subreddits/online services/blogs/recipe sites, but there is too much disorganized information for someone like me to sort through. If you have any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated, if you think I'm lazy and should find everything out on my own, I completely understand and I apologize for wasting your time. If anything hopefully this thread can become a good resource for others like me.


Some info about me:

Gender: Male

Height: 6'1/2""

Weight: 132lb (dropped from a steady 139lb)

Today I didn't have work and I think I did pretty decent with what was available in my home:

Breakfast: 1 cup of steal cut oats cooked in low fat milk / 1 orange

Lunch: 1 can of organic Trader Joe's brand potato vegetable soup / 2 slices of whole grain wheat bread with two large eggs (eggs in a nest)

Snack: 1 cliff bar

Dinner: A large mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar / 1 apple / 1 pear


I'm trying to get into a decent exercise routine and would like to build some muscle (I'm just as lost here as I am with my diet). I believe I should probably be taking in about 3000 calories a day and I'm not getting anywhere close to that. Any suggestions on what sort of food I should purchase for myself regularly would be very helpful. "	t5_2qhzr	True

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped me out! it's been about a month and I definitely took in what everyone said. I tried out a lot of different recipes (one of my favourites being cannelloni bean stuffed baked tomatoes) and since then have ultimately given up red meat.    

For health reasons at this present time (chronic tonsillitis and soon a tonsillectomy) I cannot give up chicken, as the soup/broth I make with chicken wings is currently the only thing that's allowing me to eat and will be keeping me alive after my surgery, but giving up chicken is also something I would like to cut back on and ultimately cut out.  

And if anyone was curious, the dinner party was a success with more people eating the vegetarian dish than the other!

1341357955.0	w067f	questions from a new convert	adf___	19	4	19	"Despite the obvious propagandist bent in their videos, I've just watched some of the videos on PETA's website, and I've never been more horrified and distressed by the barbaric treatment of these animals. It's clearly not an option for me to go back to eating meat after this.

However, I have a few questions about this new lifestyle. The first is that the milk and egg industry appears to be just as unethical as the meat industry. How much more expensive is the vegan lifestyle? I come from a fairly poor family so it might become untenable.

Which brings me on to my second point. Just how ethical are free-range eggs and milk? It sounds incredibly shallow of me, but if I'm going to be spending more money on ethical products, I need to ensure that animal cruelty is sustained at an absolute minimum.

And my last point. How can I get involved with animal rights activism? I'm not looking to join the Animal Liberation Front or anything, but I also don't want to be passive in this. Are there any networks you could point me towards, especially in the UK?

I appreciate all your help and hope to see you all more round here. Thanks in advance."	t5_2qhzr	True

I'm a new college student and I'm pretty much forced into a meal plan. The dining hall's vegan options are few and far between, and dairy and eggs seem to be in almost every dish.

Here is one menu Item: “The Bowl”.  Choose a carb (brown rice, linguini or grits).  Top with steamed seasonal vegetables &amp; choice of protein (Baked Tofu, house fried Tempeh or edamame) and a sauce (thai peanut, garlic tahini, fat-free red pepper sauce or white gravy)  With 1 small side (Arame, house souerkraut or house pickles) -- I will have suggestions for combinations or it may be broken into 4-5 named 'bowls'.

About a year ago, I joined the Army and introduced meat back into my body (8 years after going vegetarian, and boy was it rough) because I thought I needed to keep my options open as the military doesn't accomodate for vegetarian diets in basic training very well, and I needed to gain the muscle to keep up with their standards.

Now I'm back in college, and I would really like to return to being a vegetarian, but my budget is a bit tight and I need to get enough nutrients in my day that I can still work out and stay fit.

Unfortunately, I backslid last August (reasons below) and haven't gone back since.  I got a new job that often requires 12+ hour days, and have found myself with too little time or motivation to prepare food ahead of time so I end up going through fast food drive-throughs.  

I've felt guilty about it for the last 7 months, so I'm finally (starting today) going to get back on the wagon.  I feel like I need something to keep me honest, so to speak, and since my family and boyfriend are at the very best neutral on the subject, I thought I would post my resolution here.  Wish me luck, internet :)

(I feel the need to justify myself for backsliding: my boyfriend from England came to visit for the first time, and my family wanted to take him out for ""traditional"" American food such as burgers, BBQ, etc.  There weren't veg options at many such places, so I told myself I would just deal with it and go back to being vegetarian once he was back in England.

Some people argue for vegetarianism/veganism on the grounds that it is healthier.

I see two problems with this.

1. It's not true. Yeah, a new study came out today saying we get less cancer. But it's inconclusive and since they don't count fish as meat, doesn't really help our cause. Which leads me to what I see as the bigger problem.

2. If we argue people into vegetarianism/veganism on the grounds of health, what happens when technology advances to the point that all negative health effects can be countered? Will that make it okay to exploit animals? Of course not.

Even if you convince someone that veganism/vegetarianism is healthier, that just gives them an excuse to commit whatever sort of animal exploitation they please when it's found to be healthy.

The same problem exists when using environmentalist arguments. When someone invents a green way to slaughter cows by the millions that gives everyone convinced by an environmentalist argument to go right back to exploiting animals.

So why bother using these arguments? Why jump on every study that can even slightly sorta/kinda be interpreted as we are healthier?

I mean, wouldn't you be a vegetarian/vegan even if it made you less healthy? I know I would. So why do so many of you want to make it a debate about health? Or have I misjudged you, are you in it just for your own health?"	t5_2qhzr	True

Now I know better: vegetables can be absolutely delicious, and I'm bored of meat. Also for health reasons and I don't like factory farming. Why semi/pesca only? No good reason. I would prefer to have legumes for protein.

What I'm thinking of:

Choice of staples would be white rice, sweet potatoes and plantain bananas. Plantains preferred over sweet potatoes (taste), and sweet potatoes preferred over white rice (health?). Occasionally, I'll have unleavened, homemade flatbread. I've lived in an Arab country before, and I like flatbread.

For when I'm wanting something sweet, how about fruits? How about cooked fruits (does cooking do something bad to them)?

For protein, legumes of course. Beans, lentils, peas, hummus, etc. By the way, how many cups of legumes would suffice for a day? Mac Danzig says 80g. How many cups is that? 

For cooking oil, I'll be taking coconut oil or palm oil. Q: How much fat is needed for fat-soluble nutrients?

Common dishes would probably be stews or soups thickened by staples (I don't know if this works, just guessing). Of course I'm gonna look for recipes.

Macro ratio? I'm thinking high-carb, low-fat, just-right-protein. I have nothing against fat except that I'm thinking of going high-carb, and I don't think those two go well together.

I'm thinking of having one meal at night, or a small midday lunch and then main meal at night. Thoughts on this? Anything I should be aware of (should I worry about muscle loss, etc)?

Probably will be taking vitamin supplements. Which ones do I need most?

How active am I? I don't exercise often, but I walk a lot on schooldays (by necessity) and I use a standing desk.

Age is 18 yrs old.

So, what do you guys think?

I should mention that I'm looking to lose a bit of weight and gain a bit of muscle. Not a lot."	t5_2qhzr	True

I love beans, sort of, but I have a big problem with cooking them. I find that canned beans are usually too soft and dried (fresh, I think; at least they sprout if left for too long) are too hard. The taste of the fresh ones is much richer and thus, to me, better but the canned ones are OK. I think I prefer the canned ones though simply because they're easier to digest while undercooked hard beans leave a funny stomach feel.

I'm mainly thinking of kidney beans, but it applies to most big beans. Not to mungbeans/adzuki beans with which I rather have the problem that they're too hard or start breaking up.

I don't have a slow cooker or pressure cooker, so tips and tricks for regular pots preferred.

I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice on how to tell my parents that I've decided to become a vegetarian.  I'm at college and I am able to make my own dietary selections -- I haven't eaten meat in over three months.  I'm determined to continue with my vegetarianism over the summer, but I don't think my parents (esp. my mom) will be very accepting of this lifestyle.  If I know her, she will not be accommodating to my decision in the slightest -- she will simply refuse to cook for me (ie. if she is making meat she will simply say ""too bad"" and that will be it) because it's too much extra work.  I'm also a little apprehensive that when I go to restaurants (ie. steakhouse chains) that my family enjoys, I won't be able to find something suitable on the menu.

1270836158.0	borlb	Why is it ok to Eat Plants but Not Animals? (A Moral Dilemma)	SentientRobot	17	10	62	"From an evolutionary perspective, there is no life form that is ""better"" than any other, as every living thing has a evolved according to its environment to fit whatever niche it filled in its local ecosystem. In that sense, there is little difference between plants and animals, in the sense that plants evolved photosynthesis and leaves whereas animals evolved organs and brains. (In fact, humans share about 35% of their genes with some plants http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071011142628.htm). So if plants and animals are simply different forms of life, why is it morally ok to kill one form of life but not the other?

Is it wrong to kill animals because they feel pain? What about animals that cannot feel pain, can we kill them? What about animals that have been given anesthesia, can they be killed? The answer seems to be no. So if pain is not a criteria that determines whether or not an animal should be killed, the fact that plants cannot feel pain does not justify eating them.

Is it wrong to kill animals because they have brains and are, to some degree, aware of their surroundings? What about animals that do not have brains? What about sea anemones (which do not have brains and cannot feel pain), can we eat them? Can we eat jellyfish? My guess is that the answer is still no; that even though these animals are not meaningfully conscious, it is still wrong to kill them.

So if pain is not a moral criteria, and neither is consciousness, then what is the difference between eating an unconscious unfeeling animal and a plant?

PS - I am not trollin'

EDIT Essentially what I'm saying is that the moral issue of meat comes down to consciousness/sentience, an animals ability to experience things.  However, some animals, like sea anemones are not sentient.  If you say that they should still not be killed even though they are not aware, what is your justification for saying so?  Is it simply because they are living things?  Are plants not living things?  If you instead say that they are okay to eat because they are not meaningfully sentient, then you have admitted that sentience is a criteria for moral worth.  However, we know that some animals are more sentient than others, so those animals which are the most sentient would be due the most moral consideration.  The question therefore becomes: how do we objectively determine which level of sentience is meaningful and which isn't?"	t5_2qhzr	True
