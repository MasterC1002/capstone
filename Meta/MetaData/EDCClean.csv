1374199359.0	1ilrc0	A few statistics on guns &amp; knives on /r/EDC	ApesInSpace	477	43	343	"Hi all,

I've lurked here a bit, and started to get curious about how many people here carry knives and guns. So I decided to do a little statistical analysis on the past couple weeks of submissions, looking at gun/knife/multitool carrying, as well as age, gender, and total score. I was partially curious whether including a gun/knife might give a boost to peoples' scores.

I only analyzed posts in the last 14 days, and only those with the standard age/sex/locale/job title. I ignored a few that seemed like outliers (e.g. the july 4th flask post, the guy who got downvoted for carrying a sketchy gun, etc). Total sample was 114 submissions. Here's a few results!

Posters over the past two weeks have been 89.5% male and 10.5% female.

* 14.9% carry guns
* 71.1% carry knives
* 35.1% carry multitools (which have knives)
* 79.2% carry either a knife or multitool or both.

On average, female posts do better (57.3 points) than male posts (41.0 points), but the relationship is not significant.


On average, posts with guns do better (67.3 points) than posts without guns (38.5 points). Posts with knives do better (47.7 points) than posts without knives (30.2 points). Both of these relationships are significant (p&lt;0.05).

Stray observations:

* People with nice cameras / non-blurry pictures do far better.
* Age and karma are correlated (older posters do better).
* There's a 14 year old kid around here who carries three knives on him.

Discuss.

EDIT: This post now has more than the average 42.19 karma. And I did it without knives, motherfuckers."	t5_2reni	True

The guy was okay, if you're curious.  My Olight i3 was the hero of the evening.  I've been carrying it for so long that it was second nature for me to grab it out of my pocket and use it to light up the road, help the guy get out of his car, illuminate things as a few more of us got the vehicle back onto it's wheels, and perhaps most importantly, to direct traffic and to signal other cars to slow the hell down and not hit the immobilized SUV in the middle of the pitch-black road (as they came flying around the corner 50 yards ahead).

I realized that this whole thing would have been significantly more dangerous and difficult without such a simple tool as a AAA flashlight and just wanted to share.  Everybody should carry one in my opinion.  "	t5_2reni	True

1368546992.0	1ebjed	How my EDC Leatherman saved my Parent's House	braveally	212	44	44	"Just a story about my Leatherman and how it saved my ass. I just shared it on their site and figured I would here as well since it was a critical part of my daily EDC and what I consider to be the very reason why I still continue the practice.

Some years back, I was at my parents house with a friend of mine. We were the only two there and I was in the process of cooking some eggs. I opened the backyard door and stepped out to get some air for a few seconds before I went back to flip my eggs. My friend followed and closed the door behind him.
Funny thing about this yard door was that it locked whenever closed and can only be opened from the inside. You would not believe the shock on my face when I heard the locking slam of the door behind me, and my friend knew what he did as soon as he closed the door.
Not only were we the only ones there, I did not have my keys or phone on me at the time which meant that I had no way to get back inside. The eggs were still going and starting to smoke. I knew I had to act fast. 
The only thing I had was my trusty Leatherman Charge Ti. I was looking for any entry point into the house and noticed the aging burglar bars on the dining room window. I whipped out my Leatherman and went to the plier tool and started successfully unscrewing the closest bolt to me. The smoke alarm started to go off at this point and I could see the smoke moving into the dining area. Once I got the first bolt out there was enough room to pry the bars back and get in through the window. We keep the dining room windows unlocked because we have the bars in place and we never use them. Great, except for the window being virtually stuck in the closed position because we rarely opened them. I took out the blade on my Charge and started to cut away at the opening through the grime that has sealed it. Not a problem for my Charge. I loosened it enough to pop the window open, climbed inside and rushed to turn off the eggs and silence the smoke alarm.
By this point my friend was nearly in tears thinking he would be partially responsible for burning my parent's house. After I handled everything in the house (including putting my keys and phone in my pockets) I opened the backyard door to let my friend back in. The awe on his face at  the ability of this pocket tool to get us out such an intense situation is a look I will always remember. I just smiled, he said ""Now I see why you carry that tool on you everywhere."" Prior to this, my friends would crack jokes about my belt looking like the ""bat belt"" with my multi-tools and flashlight, now they know the importance of being ready for everything.


TL;DR Got locked out while cooking, broke back in with Leatherman Charge, saved my ass."	t5_2reni	True

With so many high-end items shown in here, I was curious what your best ""cheap"" addition has been to your EDC.

I'm new-ish here. I just want to post this somewhere. I was recently in the application process for a locally-operating security company, but was terminated 95% through my processing because I carried a pocketknife (this pocketknife is 100% legal in my area). I pass all security checks, and am outstanding for the position. (If I do say so myself.) I'd also point out that this company, has armed guards, and that I would have been serving in this capacity.

I was in their facility across three separate days. Each day, identical carry. On the third day, one of the personnel spots my pocketknife clipped to my pocket. She tells me that I have to put it in my car. (which I think is pretty dumb, especially for a security company, but I cede without argument.) Four hours later, one of the senior personnel tells me that I am out of the pipeline, because the knife was a ""red flag"". (Which makes me wonder how good this security company could be, if they have a ""red flag"" individual inside their national headquarters for four hours AFTER I'm supposedly flagged.) I was an utmost gentleman; cordial the entire time, but I have never had a bigger, personal WTF moment than this. This post is rather pointless, other than I would like a little validation as to my sanity atm."	t5_2reni	True

Had a piece of food stuck in my teeth from lunch that was starting to get uncomfortable. Didn't have any floss on hand. I keep some 550 paracord in my bag, so I took out one of the inner strands(which are composed of two strands each), unraveled it and BAM...makeshift dental floss. Worked like a charm. Hadn't heard of this use before. Feel like a genius, lol. Obviously real floss is preferable, but this definitely works in a pinch. Just goes to show how versatile it really is."	t5_2reni	True

1347607817.0	zv8d8	EDC for our Vehicles.	plethoraofpinatas	131	17	78	"We are always talking about our pocket EDC. What would you add to your car/truck EDC to make it the best setup? Call it a EDC-V of sorts perhaps.

Here's some ideas:

* bottled water

* stable food - beef jerky, granola bars, crackers, etc.

* cash - pay for tow, gas, food, etc.

* first aid kit

* [12 volt air compressor](http://www.amazon.com/Slime-COMP02-12-Volt-Tire-Inflator/dp/B000ENQRD2), needle nose pliers (to pull the nail or whatever out), [tire plug kit](http://www.amazon.com/Jaguar-Power-Sports-Quick-Tire/dp/B007PC5GUA) - never need to change a flat for you or someone in need. I've used my kit almost yearly for decades and never have to worry about a flat spare or the jack being a toy (or changing someone else's flat).

* [tow strap](http://www.amazon.com/Polyester-Strap-Rope-Hooks-10000lb/dp/B0055WP48Q) - especially in snow country.

* duct tape - cures most everything but buy quality brands only (3M, Gorilla Tape, etc.)

* [jumper cables](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Cable-08660-Heavy-Duty-Glo-Watt/dp/B00002243Y) - long, thick gauge ones make all the difference (less charging time and if too short you can't always get to the battery if the car can't be moved) - these are 4 gauge with smaller numbers meaning bigger wire. Saving $20 here will cause regret. Good cables last forever and make you a hero when needed for someone else. Real life karma.

* [mechanics wire](http://www.amazon.com/StovePipe-Mechanics-Wire-BLACK-Misc/dp/B000FPCEMM) - a spool of this can tie up any exhaust, fallen bumper or just about anything that duct tape can't do.

* maps - state maps of the places you go AND a [state topo guide for your state](http://www.amazon.com/Oregon-Atlas-Gazetteer-Delorme/dp/0899333478/ ) - the details in them are unbelievable and available at the bigger gas stations, rediscover your own state.

* flashlight - Here's a [highly recommend one](http://www.amazon.com/Fenix-Flashlights-E21-Flashlight/dp/B0041NE8TG/) that would work very well for an emergency vehicle light and is affordable. Plus it will run AA batteries. Buy the Energizer lithium variety and they can sit in the trunk for ten years and be ready to work without exploding and turning to goo. They also run longer. Feel free to ask /r/flashlight for help - we take requests.

* [tool bag](http://www.amazon.com/Stanley-STST70574-12-Inch-Soft-Sided/dp/B00775COIW/) - filled with common tools: ratchet set, two adjustable crescent wrenches (one small, one medium), small 10"" - 12"" pry bar, pliers, screwdriver w/ extensive changeable tip kit, wire stripper, black tape, lightweight work gloves (jersey gloves), assorted zip ties, allen wrench set in metric and SAE, whatever you have been finding you need to do basic repairs-etc.

* [spare fuse kit](http://www.amazon.com/Grip-150-Auto-Fuse-Set/dp/B001A567ME/) - a set of assorted mini's and regular. A kit like this will save lots of money compared to buying only one when you need it at ten times the price. Plus more real life karma for being able to help others because you have the selection.

* [spare key in magnetic lock box](http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Line-91201-Extra-Magnetic/dp/B000MVFLCY/) hidden under car - much cheaper than a locksmith's $80 slim jim job.

* [roll of blue shop towels](http://www.amazon.com/Kimberly-Clark-Scott-Towels-75130/dp/B000TRQHXS) - like regular paper towels on 'roids. You'll use them a lot.

* [waterless hand cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/Sunshine-42150-Simple-Green-Cleaner/dp/B001DENLNK) - because having filthy, greasy hands and no way to clean up sucks. Use with blue towels.

* [wool blanket](http://www.amazon.com/Israeli-Wool-Blanket-Military-Surplus/dp/B004X6DHNY/) - army surplus type, always handy and may save your life if you have to overnight in a broken down car when it's cold.

* [self standing long burn candle in container](http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Plus-Emergency-Candle-Clear/dp/B0002I1TCI/) - for cold weather country and used with the blanket, it can keep a car survivable (almost comfortable) in freezing conditions. Plus the light alerts others of your distress. Don't put it on the dash unless you want a cracked windshield (place on center column or elsewhere). Crack a window slightly so CO2 doesn't mess with you.

* car cell phone charger - with everything going to mini-usb there is really no excuse not to have a backup. Cell phones save lives. If not, you can play Angry Birds until you starve to death.

* jug of kitty litter - cold weather country again, if you get stuck the spinning tires turn snow to ice and ice to black ice. A sprinkle of this will get a gentle gas pedal on your way again (to be used with the tow strap if really stuck). An extra benefit is soaking up a fuel, coolant, or oil spill to get it out of your way.

This will all fit in a small Rubbermaid type container and relive you of worry so you can drive and know you are covered for the majority of typical problems. You are also ready to be the hero for those that did not prepare and that's a great feeling when it happens. Even if your mechanical skills are not that great, the items above give a good samaritan/friend the tools they need to help fix you.

Other tips for the best car EDC?

.

Edit - submitted good ideas:

* tarp - to wrap a body in, or just the other tons of useful stuff

* knife - the original tool

* small shovel

* any old cell phone - 911 will work in the US even without a service plan

* change of clothes - in case you unexpectedly overnight somewhere or mess yourself up

* spare warm coat, gloves, hat, insulated boots - for cold weather areas, bright colored hat/coat helps visibility

* small garbage bags - to clean out the vehicle or as puke bags for passengers - and many other uses"	t5_2reni	True

Every thread with a gun or more than one knife turns into a shitstorm.		151	43	51	I could be totally off on this but I feel that maybe a little more active (read: more) moderation might help defuse some of the ridiculous arguing that devolves out of every thread with a firearm or multiple knives.

IeatPI	161	52	262	"Tell me if my vagina is leaking, but /EDC, I've consistently noticed that almost any professional with an EDC that carries: nice things, knives, or guns receives massive downvotes. It's not even that the threads receive lower votes than 'different carries', it's more that anything the OP says inside the thread (answering questions, giving information, or what have you) receives downvotes, as well.

Why is this? Obviously no one is going to say that they're the asshole with bad etiquette, but still,help me out before downvoting this thread into oblivion. 

Thanks, /EDC!

edit: Thanks for the great discussion, /EDC. There was a lot of opinions floating around in here so thank you everyone for having a civil and professional discussion."	t5_2reni	True

I mentioned I hated seeing gun pictures with shitty holsters or just no holster in general.  Someone called me out saying maybe the OPs just didn't know anything about holsters and maybe I should attempt to educate, etc.

Anyway, here's a short and non-comprehensive list of holster companies you could/should buy from.  I only have experiences with the first two, the rest are business I've heard other people vouch for.  Click around the sites a bit.  If anyone else has input, feel free to add.  Also check out Hickock45's [video on holsters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wqlNriJ1GQ) and his other video on [IWB holsters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSUWWw14XqE).

While I am not against the United States allowing it's citizens to carry firearms, I just found a trend interesting. Most of you that carry are internal office workers while the unarmed are out and about every day delivering things or working in shops. 

I was wholeheartedly curious as to why that might be. My girlfriend is from North Carolina. She thinks it is because office workers see the same thing ever day and fear a sudden change in their sphere, while delivery and shop people see and meet new people daily so they don't have that fear.

Don't paint me as anti-gun. I'm not. It's just a trend I noticed and I wondered if anyone could explain it to me. I also don't know all the legalities. Perhaps shop and delivery workers and so on are barred from carrying a gun. I just honestly am curious."	t5_2reni	True

Don't like what someone posts?  Fine.  Do you want more diverse EDC's on here?  Help promote the subreddit!  Cross post in /r/photography, /r/watches, /r/whatever and invite them over!  

When I first started following the EDC movement on flickr several years ago, there were two groups:  one was the preparedness group, the other was the stationary (moleskine) group (also there was a small group of personal productivity people).  Of course there were occasional discussions on certain item choices people made, but it was pretty chill.  My point is to respect each other and chill...

People carry what they carry because it's what they feel valuable/important enough to carry on a daily basis.  That's really it!  Unless it's illegal,  highly immoral, irrelevant, spam, or obvious trolling, please stop messaging the mods to delete a post.

However I have run into something recently that I disagree with quite strongly, and that is: people who carry extensive medical gear and have little to no first aid training.

I want to relate the issue to a more commonly discussed topic here, guns. What would we call a person who included a pistol as part of their EDC, but who had never actually fired a gun, only watched videos/read articles online? We would probably call them an idiot, and a danger to themselves and the general public. It is generally well known that any tool, (not just guns) can be extremely dangerous when misused. However for some reason this logic does not seem to extend to medical equipment/first aid procedures for some people in /r/EDC.

I wanted to highlight two recent examples that typify this problem. 

1. The [medical kit](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/ulcpn/as_promised_my_edc_med_kit/) of a bank employee in Chicago (I mention profession and location to emphasize that they are not in a remote area, far from professional medical aide). This person has no formal first aid training[^1](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/ueyji/male_chicago_workweek_edc_work_in_finance/c4wdi7m). They have omitted two vital components of the most basic of basic urban first aid kits: gloves, and a CPR mask for rescue breathing. This person then then goes on to argue with two posters (one of whom is a former army medic/current nurse) who point out that one piece of his kit is likely to induce infection and sepsis if used[^2](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/ulcpn/as_promised_my_edc_med_kit/c4ws6fg).

1. The [medical portion](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/usj0g/my_edc_bag_23muk/) of the EDC of an IT professional in the UK (also likely not far from a professional ambulance service). Again this person is packing serious first aid gear, even a hemostatic bandage, but is lacking a CPR mask, and has no training[^1](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/usj0g/my_edc_bag_23muk/c4y9u88).

It is absolutely admirable that people want provide aid to people in need, and be equipped to respond to a medical emergency, but unless you are trained to use the tools that you carry, the result can actually cause harm to someone, instead of helping them.

You may also think that causing inadvertent harm while attempting to provide first aid, while very unfortunate, won't have any legal ramifications for you. **This is not necessarily the case**. Good Samaritan laws often protect people except in cases of gross negligence (which is itself subjective), but certain states in the US (I'm not familiar with laws outside of the US) only afford protection to healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses, EMTs, etc. This includes, for example, [Alabama](http://www.heartsafeam.com/files/Alabama_Good_Samaritan_Act.pdf), and [Connecticut](http://www.heartsafeam.com/files/Connecticut_Good_Samaritan_Act.pdf) to name two. In other states that seem to have ironclad protection, you can still end up as the target of a lawsuit, [example from California](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1871331,00.html), where a woman who ended up as a paraplegic after a car accident sued the friend who dragged her away from the burning car.

Before anyone who lives in an urban environment adds things like QuikClot, an Israeli Bandage, or a chest seal, please please please pick up a few pairs of gloves and a CPR (to protect yourself from disease), the supplies for a basic bandage, and take a damn first aid course so you can do things like assess vital signs (pulse/respiration/skin condition/cap refill/level of consciousness). This will let you provide useful information to 911/the real EMTs when they arrive.

For first aid/first responder courses check out the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.d8aaecf214c576bf971e4cfe43181aa0/?vgnextoid=58d51a53f1c37110VgnVCM1000003481a10aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default) or its respective websites in your country of residence.

**TLDR: Carrying super tactical combat trauma first aid gear without training is bad, and you should feel bad. Also depending on where you live you can be sued if you fuck up.**"	t5_2reni	True

Just a few quick things about guns/knives:

* Yes, we carry knives and guns.

* Read the FAQ on the right and learn about why we carry these tools before asking us why.

* People often post images with 2 or 3 guns/knives, and state that they rotate these, only carrying one of each at a time.

* If you have any questions about this, after checking the FAQ, let us know! We live across the globe, across many governments and all have different norms that we grew up with. For example, a person in Texas has a more gun-friendly mentality than someone who grew up in So-Cal.

Aside from that, please follow the rules on the right, have a great time, and please post your EDC! "	t5_2reni	True

I don't think these posts are innocent in nature. I think you're just inept at the guerrilla marketing you're trying to execute. I don't think these posts are useful to the forum, and I think complaining when /r/EDC users critique your products (you call it ""defending"") is inappropriate.

I like this forum to learn about what people carry. I don't need to be sold high-end leather. 

Would love to know if other people found it interesting, or not.

If a person is carrying them for self defense, they better damn well have the training to back it up or they'll be in serious trouble from both the assailant, and the law, or they're an idiot. 

Knives are tools. Do people look at kitchen knives and go ""Why do you have knives in your kitchen!?!? Is it really that dangerous of a place that you need knives!?"" No, because we've been conditioned to feel that they're expected there, and that they're tools.

People also carry guns. So what? They like to be prepared. They may never use them, but they feel more secure carrying them. This, however, IS a case of self defense. Most likely (and I really hope so...) these people are permitted to carry concealed, and have the proper training to do so. 

Personally, I carry two knives. One on my belt and one in my pocket. Do you know where I live, what I do on a daily basis, or what they're used for? No, not unless I tell you, and a picture of my EDC can't do that very easily. I break down an average of 50+ boxes a day for my job. I live in a state that allows open carry of firearms, and people out here DO exercise that right. My fiancee owns horses and we're looking at getting into some ranch property, where you better damn well have a knife on you for chores. 

Overall, knives are tools. People who instantly see them as weapons are unable to see past that. I carry a knife the same reason I carry my sunglasses, two different styles of pens, and Band-Aids in my wallet, because I use them, and they're all tools.

What factors should be considered before doing so?	iamMikeWilson	114	27	119	"Background: I am from the Northeast of America and always considered myself very liberal when it came to politics and never considered gun ownership as something I would want. Lately however, I have begun to see a firearm as a tool, rather than just a weapon. Over Christmas, a family friend who is a police officer commented, ""if shit hits the fan, a $20 bill won't equal a meal, but a bullet can.""

That line of thinking really changed my perspective and as someone who wants to always be prepared to take care of myself and my family, I am curious about what kinds of decisions need to be made to determine the right course of action.

(If I do pursue this, I would make sure to take training sessions and know how to properly conduct myself *before* ever buying one.)

Recently, we were going over Robinson Crusoe, and one of the class exercises was, ""come up with a list of the 6 items you would want to have with you on a deserted island"".

I had all 6 in my backpack--a multitool, lighter, bundle of cord, steel water bottle, multi-purpose towel/headscarf/particulate filter, and large plastic bag (in this case, for building a solar still or collecting rainwater).

It was pretty gratifying to watch the sudents' jaws drop as they listed useful items and I produced them and put them on the desk.

""And you just *carry* these things?""

I explained that all of these things are useful, whether you're on a deserted island or just bicycling around town, and that Robinson Crusoe's most important tools were preparedness and ingenuity.

It was a good day."	t5_2reni	True

1357264765.0	15xatf	Hello Reddit, looks like we got an influx from /r/askreddit	amroc987	100	16	35	"It appears we have quite a few new people here after the post in /r/askreddit, so I feel that I should address some quick questions and issues:

- read the FAQ for why people carry guns and knives. It's been asked numerous times in many different ways, all with the same answers.

- We come from different countries, with different cultures and norms, thus we carry different items. I live in the suburbs, so it's out of the norm for me to see someone carrying a Metro card or something that's needed in a big city.

- We don't always post phones or keys or wallet because these are fairly damn standard. We like to show off new or unique items that we have.

- Read the rules please. If you have a question, ask it nicely. Don't accuse people of being murderers in your question on why they carry a firearm every day.

- Please post your EDC! Give us some background, like the standard ASL, what you do for a living, and a list of what the items are in the picture. If you feel that something is unique to your carry, like a special silver coin, explain the significance to you, and why you carry it.

Welcome to /r/EDC, hope you have a great time here!"	t5_2reni	True

I have one that I kept in my back pocket for 18 months, and, aside from developing a small curve, the binding is still together and everything in it is still legible, despite being soaked numerous times. Here is the inside of the book: http://imgur.com/Xmu07Hg, and here is what's written on the last page http://imgur.com/rd3roSJ

We mods always hate interrupting your normal EDC browsing experience, but I just wanted to say we should keep memes in /r/AdviceAnimals because they don't belong in this sub. Pics of your EDC, questions, recommendations, etc are all great here, but remember our rules:

**2) Don't Be A Dick**

and now

**3) No Memes**

Let's all learn from each other and why we carry the things we do. Discussions about guns/knives/etc will always come up, but let's make them HEALTHY discussions.  That's all from me- have a great day!

I have been carrying a [Brewzer](http://www.leatherman.com/product/Brewzer) on my keychain for a while... mostly using it as a bottle opener, but secretly anticipating a day I might need to pry something with it.

Well, that day had come.  I was working at a remote office, helping to replace a few computers.  The PC's needed to sit in small shelves... but they didn't fit due to a small plastic lip glued to the edge of the shelves.  The lips were too small for me to grasp and I was stumped for a good couple of minutes.

""If only I had  screwdriver or a..."" and then I remembered the little prybar in my pocket.  I wedged it under the plastic lip and have it a tap and up the lip came.

I know, I know... this is hardly an amazing story, but to me it so perfectly encapsulates why I carry these things in my pocket.  Without that prybar, I likely would have had to leave and make a trip back in another day.  Instead, I got the job done and had time to spare.

1364839287.0	1bfor3	[META] - Changes to /r/edc (effective immediately)	HYPEractive	122	50	16	"Hi all,

As many of you all have seen, /r/edc has turned into a pretty polarizing subreddit.  It's the complete opposite of what this subreddit was initially supposed to be about.

As we have stated before, /r/edc is supposed to be about sharing with the world what we all value enough to carry on a daily basis.  It brought together the fireman from NYC, to the musician from Australia, to the student in Sweden, in order to share ideas and interesting tidbits about lives around the world.  /r/edc is now about arguing about politics and religion, things we thought this subreddit could escape from.

Effective immediately, /r/edc will start transitioning to a new topic, something more ""unifying."". We have been getting multiple submissions concerning the [**Electric Daisy Carnival**](http://electricdaisycarnival.com/) which appears to be some pretty hip and funky annual party.  The mods have normally been filtering out these submissions and messages, but we now feel it would be best to transition this subreddit to be dedicated to the Electric Daisy Carnival.

Thank you for the years of submissions, discussions, suggestions, and feedback.  We hope that the new /r/edc provides the friendly atmosphere that reddit users look for, and unifies users not on what they carry on a daily basis... but on the [**dance floor...**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u-vmk9iapQ).

Thank you again,

/r/edc mods

The plans and resources guys spent the first 15 minutes of this hilarious debacle searching for a building manager, and alas, no key would free the trapped NCO. After noticing the hinges were exposed on the door, I ran into the backshop and retrieved a mini sledge. Once I returned, used the pin punch tool on my Leatherman MUT to unseat the hinge pins with the mini sledge. Once the punch tool had no more room to offer, I clamped the top of the hinge pins with the pliers and hit the side of the Leatherman with my sledge. (I was scared at first to do this, but I figured if I broke them I could probably convince the unit to get me another). Got all the pins out, he kicked the door down from the inside and was free to roam the halls and sip coffee as usual!

The Leatherman MUT took a beating with that sledgehammer and still feels like I just took it out of the box, this thing has performed remarkably since I got it last year. The only major damage ive done to it is blow a chunk out of the plier tip by dropping it into the engine bay of a Humvee. The ass end of the tool made contact with ground and the pliers made contact with a hotspot. A fireworks display of sparks almost gave me a heart attack."	t5_2reni	True

1358347754.0	16opph	[META] On the subject of excluding items from your EDC.  	joshcoles	85	16	36	"First of all, I really love this subreddit, despite having never made a post here.  There's just one thing that has been bothering me lately. 

DAE think that users should be encouraged to not leave items out of their posts?  I've seen a lot of posts, such as [/u/arecibo560's from last night](http://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/16nydp/22mor_it_technician_part_time_student/), which are lacking common items like a wallet or keys, for example.  

When asked about the lack of wallet, arecibo560 said ""Its not very photogenic, its a mighty wallet and didn't really fit the theme.""

Then what's the point?  Can I just take a photo of my knife and car key, call it my EDC and get praise for how minimalist it is?  Of course not, because it's not all that I carry with me.  

I guess I just wanted to get your opinions on the subject.  If you all disagree and downvote me to hell that's fine, but I just wanted to get this point across."	t5_2reni	True
