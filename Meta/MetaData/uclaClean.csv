1329885857.0	q0h3i	The definitive best/worst places to take a shit at UCLA	detective_mosely	96	12	63	"Unlike some, I don't mind taking a nice shit in public. It makes the matter even better when I'm taking a shit on the campus of the greatest university in the world and my alma mater – UCLA.

I like handling my business in nice, clean bathrooms where I'm the only one around, with a cool ambience. Therefore, these are the factors that contributed to my rankings. Feel free to contribute your opinions in the comments, I'd love to know your thoughts, or more importantly, if criteria on this list are outdated, as I graduated four years ago. Also, pardon the north campus bias, as that's where I spent a majority of my time.

**Top 5 Best**

**5. Kerckhoff Hall**
Writing for the Daily Bruin meant that I spent quite a bit of time amongst the other writers at Kerckhoff Hall (and mocking the Persians at Kerckhoff Patio). While it doesn't get a glowing review in terms of satisfying my most important criteria, the bathrooms were vintage, gave you access to a roof, and were where I wrote my thesis for my senior seminar on my laptop.

**4. Young Research Library (YRL)**
My preferred place of study (top floor), YRL always makes for a good shit as you're almost always the only one there. This also helps if you worry about leaving your belongings while you're out taking a shit. I was always puzzled at how clean the toilets were in YRL.

**3. Kaufman Hall**
Arguably the classiest shit you'll take on campus, Kaufman keeps their bathrooms well-stocked and clean mostly because all the events that go on in here. Can get a little too busy for me, but if I wanted to take the shitting equivalent of a night on the town, I'd go here.

**2. Student Activities Center (SAC)**
Some of the most relieving shits were taken here as the SAC maxes out the two important categories of cleanliness and privacy. I preferred the single-stall bathroom in the eastern wing of the building.

**1. Royce Hall**
This is a controversial pick for number one as it's quite unlike my positive criteria – it's not the cleanest *and* it's a busy bathroom, but I loved taking a shit here because of the history of it all. Look around – you're taking a shit in an extraordinary, iconic building. Being an English major, I took some classic post-final shits here. The traditional values may be low, but the historical and sentimental values are high here.


**Top 5 Worst**

**5. YRL**
For as much as I didn't mind shitting at YRL, the part that annoyed me was the sterile fluorescent ambience of the entire building, and the inexplicably low toilets. Really – my knees were elevated as if I was sitting on a child's potty bench.

**4. Melnitz Hall**
You'd think a building dedicated to our renown School of TV, Film, and Theater would have some nice Hollywood shit-housing porcelain, but this bathroom was old, dirty, and busy. The writing on the walls of the stalls can be viewed as a positive or a negative addition, but the shits you'll have here will be dirty and forgettable.

**3. Ackerman Union**
To be fair, Ackerman has more traffic than most venues on this list, but you'd think that'd call for extra attention. The restroom on the east wing, 2nd floor of Ackerman is dirty, busy, and the stalls are cramped. Fun Find: Next time you're here, note ""UCLA"" tiled on the floor near the exit.

**2. South campus restrooms**
This might be out of date as I've come to find out that they're finally replacing the buildings in south campus, but when I roamed those halls to visit my engineering major compadres or to attend my curiously room-assigned Shakespeare discussion, Boelter Hall was always one of the more underwhelming venues for shitting. For what it gains in the privacy factor, it loses in ambience – this place is excessively bright, devoid of life, and unremarkable – much like the building's regular inhabitants.

**1. Powell Library**
Powell was where I'd get my late-night studying and babe-watching done if I was with my ""study buddy"" (YRL felt like I Am Legend compared to Powell late at night). There never was a time where I'd go to the bathroom in the basement where it didn't have someone else in it, the floor wasn't flooded, the faucets didn't work, the soap didn't smell like some sort of pungent institutional powdered soap, or that the hinges or locks on the stalls weren't broken. I don't know who the fuck is responsible, but to his credit – EVERYTHING is wet, flooded, and disgusting – perpetually – in Powell."	t5_2qscu	True

1343682362.0	xetlh	I caught a floor pisser in Ackerman today...	DataKeeper	91	15	45	"So I headed over to Ackerman for some Dorito Tacos and afterwards I go use the restrooms (first floor, Avenue A). So I'm in a stall, doing my business, when a guy walks into the stall next to me. 

But then something strange happened...

His feet disappeared, he must have been standing on the toilet.

I was afraid he was going to try and screw with me. You know, fling some toilet paper at me, etc.

But no, I saw the piss hit the ground, I cried a little on the inside. I finished up, washed my hands and waited for all of 15 seconds for him to leave. 

The assailant was an international student ""from China"". When confronted he said he thought it was the norm to piss on the floor. I told him no, no it wasn't and had him clean the floor with some toilet paper. 

He left, one of the UNHCR volunteers in the bathroom and I had a good laugh. I walk out and the pisser was talking to his group of friends (all international students it seems, as they were speaking Chinese). I gave him a glare and when he finally looked at me I shook my head slowly (just to add a little) and the UNHCR guy just laughed.


This is the third time I have witnessed an international student pissing on the floor of Ackerman.

This can include various tips on money, dorms, partying, what to bring, etc etc. 

Some sub-categories we can use to organize this are:

-Places to eat in Westwood

-Things you'll forget to bring to school but need

-Getting involved socially

-Money saving tips

-Best places to study and why

-Dorm life

-What NOT to do at UCLA

-Academic advice

(any other suggestions)

So post your best tips, tricks, and suggestions here, and as the list grows, I'll edit this top post to aggregate all of our best ideas into THE REDDITORS ULTIMATE GUIDE TO UCLA!

**Edit:** Oh man, I'm so stoked you guys are giving so much awesome input! Once I get the chance, I will aggregate the best, most objective, and most suggested things up here. I'll leave the more biased/opinion oriented ones for the comment section. Once the list is completed or this thread dies down, i'll see to putting it up in the side bar or something. Keep it up!

I showed him on his map, and as I was headed off, he stopped me. He gave me his business card, and explained he was salesman for Armani and he was lost after leaving an Armani convention at the Staples Center. He mentioned that he still had 4 jackets that he didn't want to pay the tax on when he went through customs and asked me if I would like them. 

At this point, I stopped him. It seemed to me at the time he was just a shady salesman looking to sell some stuff, so I told him I was a poor college student who barely had enough to pay tuition and get food. He insisted that he wanted me to take the jackets for free, a token of gratitude. He even pulled out his wallet, showing me it was stuffed with bills. ""See? I have plenty of credit cards and money. I'm not in it for the profit, I just want to thank you properly."" 

He showed me the jackets, telling me how much each were worth ($1300, $1500, $1200, $1600).  ""All yours, as long as you like them"". Of course, alarm bells were going off at this point. $5600 of merchandise for giving him some directions? I was curious where this was going. ""I love them"", I told him. He smiled, bagged them up, and handed them to me. I took the handles of the bag, and he said ""do you think you could do me a favor?"". 

He explained that his car was a rental that he had gotten for a full month. There were still two weeks left, and he wondered if I might help him pay for the remaining time ($500 in cash). He even offered to drive me to the bank if I didn't have that much on me. I told him no, I didn't have that kind of money. He spent the next 5 minutes cajoling, asking me how much I could possibly come up with, could I borrow any money from friends, any textbooks I could sell etc. After it became clear he wasn't getting any money out of me, he took back the suits and even his business card.

I got back home after class and checked out what events had been going on at the Staples center. Certainly nothing that an Armani salesman would attend. I think this guy was probably running around with knockoff Armani jackets trying to scam someone out of their 500 bucks. "	t5_2qscu	True

1359088095.0	178kwj	Big win for Bruins on road vs. #6 Arizona 84-73	BBWpantysniffer	59	6	37	"The Bruins grabbed the lead early and never relented - this was the best road win UCLA has had in the last 4-5 years. 

With Travis Wear out for the second half with a concussion, Tony Parker finally got the minutes he deserved and made the best of them. Howland inexplicably has sat him and he needed this experience to strengthen his confidence. David Wear, who makes many cringe every time he touches the ball, put on a very strong performance but tried to play hero 5 too many times with his brother's absence. Shabazz Muhammed played like the highly touted recruit was expected to play against big-time opponents. Larry Drew II fed everyone and finished with 9 assists. All in all, it was a well-rounded game against an AZ team who has some pretty nice wins already this year.

[Full Box Score] (http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=330240012)

As a whole, the team is definitely showing signs of improvement. They are still off in many ways from the 2005-2007 teams that were explosive on offense and crippling on defense. I personally hate the protection of leads that we've seen lately, especially since the majority of games did not end the way this one did. Arizona did cut the lead to four, but the young Bruins showed poise I have not seen this year and finished very well.

1326228412.0	oba8o	Just sent this message to the campus about the piracy email... UCLA violates FCC codes	devilsassassin	59	12	22	"I just emailed this over to FSinquiry. I don't know if you guys watched that video that was just emailed out about file sharing, but it is a complete and utter load of crap.

UCLA violates FCC codes, here is my email describing how:

Hi,

In order to enforce your 'piracy' filtering/snooping. You violate ALL
THREE parts of the FCC Report and Order issued on December 21 2010.
This blocks legitimate traffic. I do not pirate content, but I
understand how it works because I am a network engineer. File sharing
is used for MANY OTHER THINGS than pirating of material. If File
sharing was not allowed, the internet would not work. Also, an
operating system like Unix would never exist without the ability to
transfer LEGAL material over the internet.

The fact that your movie is so blatantly biased towards the movie
industry, and against the tech industries of the internet. The
Draconian rules on campus for internet usage, as I have said before,
violate the FCC report and order that I have attached.

Since I cannot write it better, here it is in the words of the Federal
Communications Commission:

I. PRESERVING THE FREE AND OPEN INTERNET
1. Today the Commission takes an important step to preserve the Internet as an
open platform for innovation, investment, job creation, economic
growth, competition, and free
expression. To provide greater clarity and certainty regarding the
continued freedom and
openness of the Internet, we adopt three basic rules that are grounded
in broadly accepted Internet
norms, as well as our own prior decisions:
i. Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network
management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and
conditions of their
broadband services;
ii. No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful
content, applications,
services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not
block lawful
websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony
services; and
iii. No unreasonable discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not
unreasonably
discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.

Violation of subsection i falls under the fact that UCLA will not
disclose any of their network management practices. Go ahead, ask them
and you will get a brick wall.

Violation of subsection ii falls under the blocking of LEGAL DNS
service (port 53). By not allowing access to outside DNS servers
(which is 100% legal I might add), they are blocking lawful content,
and potentially blocking lawful websites.

Violation of subsection iii falls again under the blocking of DNS
service (port 53). By forcing the use of UCLA DNS servers, they are
unreasonably discriminating against other DNS service providers (such
as open DNS).

So now that you know the information, and ways you violate the law.
Please tell me why taxpayer money is being used to undermine the
efforts of the Federal Communications Commission. As an educational
institute, it is your job to set the example, and lead the pack. Not
follow the money trail.

Until the pieces of legislation the Stop Online Piracy Act, and the
Protect Intellectual Property Act are passed, DNS filtering is
ILLEGAL. I demand that you cease and desist, and send a message to ALL
students apologizing for your blatant disregard to Federal codes
regarding broadband control and usage.

I am a UCLA student, and I do not want the name of my school tarnished
by such a terrible, and inaccurate movie. There are two ways to
falsify information easily. By lying, or omission. UCLA has chosen to
do the latter.

Remember, we're representing UCLA, so let's make sure we look good. 

With that being said, even if we don't win this contest, I'm so stoked that we've gotten this far with our little community. For a while the subreddit was a barren place, but now we're getting new posts every day, and it's great seeing some activity in this place.

Feel free to ask ANY questions you may have, such as why you should choose UCLA over other schools. We know that this is an exciting time, but also confusing and terrifying, so don't hesitate to ask us about anything, and we'll try to answer as honestly as we can. Dorm life, packing list, classes, social life etc etc. 

If you have specific questions regarding majors or minors, /r/ucla pretty much has at least one person in each major, so feel free to ask those questions too. Most of our members have flair that say our major and graduation year and we're all willing to answer any questions about our major. 

**Current students:** Please contribute any general advice or experiences you'd like to give! No need to wait for a question, since your advice might answer their question beforehand. Also, lets be nice.

So if you live near UCLA and are willing to help out a potential friend, message me an email address, and we'll correspond. Couchsurfing would be nice too, for those living off-campus, but is not essential. I don't have a phone.


I promise I'm not a creeper or murderer or anything of the sort.


(This'll probably get downvoted. I accept this fate, should it transpire, and apologize in advance if this sort of request is not tolerated. Cross-posted to r/uclaclassifieds and Craigslist; apologies if you see it more than once.)

**Update: shower acquired!** Thank you, UCLA Redditors! You have probably Solved My Problem. I could't find the Life Sciences Building, so I tried Kaufman Hall, but was unable to locate a shower thence, so I went to the Student Activities Center and used the shower there. Not knowing the etiquette, and slightly uncomfortable with the alternative (owing to the lack of doors), I remained slightly clothed erstwhile. But a shower is a shower nonetheless. If this solution does not work out long-term, I will implement other suggestions as needed. Thanks once again!

When I first became a moderator in this subreddit, it was a bowl of dust. A very small, very unattractive bowl of dust. Like the bowls you would see refugees eating from in post-apocalyptic films. There were maybe 20 or so subscribers, many of whom I believe were alumni who wished something would grow out of the subreddit which represented their alma mater. 

Fast forward just a year and a half and our fledgling village has transformed into a fast-growing city (and will hopefully become a bustling metropolis!). 

The moderators of this community (unchikun, GodRa, jennz, and myself) who work only to make your experience in this city optimal, are working tirelessly behind the scenes to make certain your stay is what you expect from a community which represents one of the top higher education institutions in the world. So if you have ANY concerns, questions, or just want to chat, don't be shy. We have candy.  

I would also like to make a toast to jennz, who through her amazing chalk drawings, facebook group, flyers, and her efforts towards the Grow a Subreddit competition has helped bring in more than double the amount of subscribers we have had than before she joined us.  

And you, you are the reason this community exists. Your stories, your meet-ups, your compassionate study help, even your humorous jabs at our godly perfect sports teams are the reason people are attracted to this city and decide to stay. 

So thank you, fellow bruin/alumni/staff/fan for growing our community.

I graduated from UCLA in 2012 and have been working on a website to help college students find apartments. Finding an apartment really sucks, and we tend to find out how crappy an apartment is after-the-fact. Well, it's that time of year again, and I hope that I can help you find a good one!

The website is called Aptologist. It's designed to remove the clutter you'd see on other websites and to focus on the important things. It's built around reviews so you can finally call out that landlord for extorting you out of your deposit!

It's still in a beta phase, so I really, REALLY want to hear your feedback (positive, negative, thermonuclear, catfacts, whatever). Please post some reviews while you're there and help out some fellow students!

Thanks!

I'm having a really hard time making friends...the people on my floor are friendly enough but we don't have a lot in common.  I'm not a drinker and I don't really go to parties, and I don't have a lot of interest in music (which seems to be a huge bonding thing on this floor).  I feel like I don't have that much to contribute to conversations, and I'm getting really overwhelmed and tired (emotionally and physically--I'm finding it hard to sleep, because I'm stressed and also because there are people in our room a lot so I can't really sleep even if I wanted to).  Everyone else seems to have found friends already and they look like they're having so much fun.  But because we don't have much in common and because I'm a quieter person, and because I don't party BUT I still want to be social--I'm having a really hard time here.  Is this normal?  Does it get better once classes start?  I know it's bad but I kind of wish I could just go home.

Edit: Thank you guys for all of the kind words and words of advice.  I went to the activities fair and found a couple volunteer clubs--I'm not religious or ethnic or a singer or a good athlete or the sorority type, so I had some issues at first finding some.  Honestly I'm still pretty depressed and having a lot of trouble finding friends and fitting in and I still want to go home.

Naw, you probably know I was homeless, and now I'm not!  I bought me a cheap little mobile home that's just off of the UF campus.  I would say it was something on the order of 100 times cheaper than the cheapest place in Westwood! This is where I came to school as a freshman in 1993, so I feel really comfortable here.  I've been working out like a madman and my clothes have gotten even sexier.  I was kind of lost and socially intimidated at UCLA, but I am owning this place like nobody's business.  I'm like a whirlwind of pure love.  My dancing is way better... I just use headphones now, so that really frees me up.  I wasn't really able to make any friends there, which I guess is a result of both my homelessness and UCLA students' social ""sophistication"", or whatever.  I flirt with countless beauties every day.  So many of them want to take pictures with me, and now they are really starting to feel comfortable with me.  It's only been flirty talk so far, but things are about to start happening.  This place is a party school par excellence, I am like a rock n' roll god here.  I've put the frat boys on notice.  They are so annoyingly cocky here at UF... all I want to do is steal away their sorority girlfriends, LOL. I don't like those kinds of guys, never have, never will.

The mods of /r/ucla are putting on some [flair](http://imgur.com/EHLB1)!
This is with the help of ExtremePopcorn who created BigFriendlyRobot and Alvin6226 who kindly suggested it.
 
We would like to keep the flair nice and organized so as of right now, we're suggesting /r/ucla to follow along with this format:

Students and Alumni!:

""Major 'Year""

For example:
""Computer Science '14"" or
 ""English '08"" (or shorten it up!)

Staff!: ""Staff""
 
Fans!: ""Fan""
 
Now, we love suggestions so if you do have any, please list them here!

And of course, please keep the flair clean and refrain from having anything profane.
 
**Directions:**
[Click on this link](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BigFriendlyRobot&amp;subject=ucla) and type in your tag in the message box and send it. Post a comment in about 10 minutes and you should see your new nifty flair!
You can always update it or remove it.

Enjoy!!!

Anyway!

First off... **/R/UCLA SWAG!!**

Now that I have your attention: There will soon be a ""a meetup themed prize pack"" in the mail heading my direction, so get stoked!! So I'll probably be organizing some big official meet up, so don't feel pressured to create your own right now. Also, again, as for distribution of swag, priority for things will go to people who helped out most during the competition. More on that when we get the stuffs. 

Speaking of meet-ups! I notice a lot of meetup attempts that garner only a few people. Bigger ones can be done, but you need to *plan ahead.* I'll type up some tips... later. i'm quite tired right now.

Anywho. There will be some sort of reddit ""college week"" where the front page layout will match the winner's school's subreddit css. We're still working on a redesign and logo (i've been busy :( ). Again, if anyone wants to help out with anything (ie: css, logo redesign, artistic input) feel free to message me and we'll get ya into the loop.

i think that's all I wanted to say. i probably forgot something, but i'll read this again in the morning and update. 

Have a good rest of your week! And for the coming quarter, some words of wisdom from your beloved moderator:

And then he forgot to shut down the torrent before he left, so the next time he used his computer on campus, it started up again and he got caught for on-campus torrenting that he didn't even want to do.

I dunno how gung-ho some of you might be about filesharing but be warned, you only have one get-out-of-jail-free card, and even that comes with temporarily denied internet access and a required ""File Sharing Workshop"". Watch out folks, don't make the same mistake he did."	t5_2qscu	True

Seriously, I just came here for grad school, and it blows my mind.

* Today, there was dramatic reading of prisoner letters to stand in support of the prisoner hunger strike.
* On Wednesday, Christopher Dusseault of the Prop 8 trial fame spoke in the Public Policy building about the trial.
* All week, the largest occupy protest outside of New York City has been going on.
* Next week, fucking Ambassador Christopher Hill is speaking on campus.

And it's all free! Yet, all I can seem to meet are students who have no interest in any of this. How about you, /r/UCLA? Any politically-active Redditors who would be interested in joining me for these sorts of events, or letting me know about other ones on or around campus?

I checked draft history for both schools to see how long it's been since UCLA had overtaken USC for the first player from either school to be taken in the draft. The last time was 2002 when Bruin OLB Robert Thomas was taken with the 31st pick of the 1st round, while DB Kris Richard was the first Trojan to be selected in the draft, the 85th pick in the 3rd round.

I tried to look up final Big Boards by year to be more exclusive, but I couldn't find them so I just went with actual draft position.

Regardless, an already fantastic turn around for our football program is looking to be even more exciting come April.

We're competing against other schools to get to 25GB(!) for 2 years. Stanford and Cal are currently ahead of us. Let's crush them! Also, space.

Referral link, if for some reason you don't already have a dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/spacerace?r=NTMzMzU5MTU5

More info here: https://blog.dropbox.com/2012/10/now-announcing-the-great-dropbox-space-race/

Copy-pasta from above link:

**Rules**

* You must register for Space Race with an eligible school email address (if you have an existing Dropbox account you can still join)!
* If you’ve signed up for Dropbox with a non-school email, no problem! You can verify your school account on the Space Race page.
* Your school gets 1 point for each person who registers for Space Race and installs Dropbox on their computer (if they haven’t already).
* Your school gets 2 more points for each person that goes through the Get Started guide (including you!)

**Free Space!**

* Just by signing up, you get 3 GB for two years.
* Each level your school achieves means more free space. That means the more classmates and friends you rally to Dropbox, the more space every Space Racer at your school gets, up to 25 GB for two years!
* In addition to earning points, you’ll still get the normal 500 MB bonus for each referral.
* You’ll have 8 weeks to get as many people as you can from your school signed up for Space Race!

Janet is an amazing girl I met during my first year at UCLA.  We were in the same GE Cluster (Global Environment!) and have kept in touch since then.  She has always been one to make an impact not only on those close to her but also the world around her.

Janet has gone through one round of cancer - she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2009.  She fought it with grace and determination, was able to beat it, and was in remission until late 2011.  Now, Janet needs to find a bone marrow match by this April.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCyz8F_kuo&amp;feature=player_detailpage

Knowing Janet and hearing stories about all the other people waiting for a bone marrow transplant pushed me to register to be a bone marrow donor.  If I am a match for anyone, I will gladly help out.

Here's where you can help.  **Monday, January 23rd, there will be a bone marrow registry drive at Ackerman Grand Ballroom from 6pm-10pm.**  Please please please consider registering.

Here are some helpful resources to register:

I prepared as much as a could before I got here, but just two days into the first week I find myself drowning in work to do. I've had issues with anxiety before due to school, but here I feel completely hopeless and have no idea how I'm going to get through the rest of the quarter. I've tried to get counseling from the CAPS center but unfortunately the only available times they ever have are during my classes, so here I am pathetically reaching out to strangers. 

I feel so lost and no matter how much studying I've tried to do during zero week and this first week, I'm barely keeping up with my assignments by a thread. All I can think about is how I don't want to be in this situation anymore but I'm stuck. So my issue doesn't really seem to be time management, but the fact that I'm just not good enough to be here. Ever since classes started my anxiety about this has been through the roof, and I can't seem to calm myself down.  "	t5_2qscu	True

So let's do some planning! If anyone has any ideas of what to do, where to go, post them here, and then we can discuss. After that we'll make an Facebook Event and invite the [/r/ucla Facebook Group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/198370070197972/). We can always chat in there too.

There was also some interest in doing a late night ent meetup, which we can also discuss. ;) 

Next weekend would be best, so we have some time to plan/invite.

While losing makes it difficult to re-secure a #2 spot, it's definitely possible, and they've done it before.


The best way to help their chances is for every team that they'll be facing from here on to be as highly ranked as possible so that their strength of schedule allows them the possibility of rising back up the rankings.  That includes us.  So any legitimate SC fan, if they want to see their team succeed at the end of the season, has to root for our team to win every single game we play, at least until we play them, which is another 7 games.

Introducing... [The /r/ucla Classifieds](http://www.reddit.com/r/UCLAclassifieds/) subreddit!

So, I know a lot of you have approached me about /r/ucla getting cluttered with housing, apartments, and roommate requests, so I've created a subreddit to consolidate these sorts of posts. I'm hoping by tagging the posts, it'll make searching easier if you're looking for a specific type of request. 

Also, I will give the current housing posts on /r/ucla **one week** before I delete them. Currently, I don't think there's an easy way to move the threads, so i'll let those who are still looking just create new, more descriptive posts. After a week, hopefully our sub is going to be less crowded, so we can get some content going as the new school year starts.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions!

-Jenn

I hope I'm not being offensive. I don't mean this in a malicious way. I realize these are people I'm talking about. For me at least, these people were a big part of my experience walking around on campus every day. They seem to have more passion for life that most and it was always nice to see them.

Also, if you have other ideas or suggestions on how you'd like to see the front page look on our day, post them here too! 

Since they don't know an exact date of when we're going on the front page, getting something within the next 2 weeks would be best, so **the tentative deadline will be November 15**. That can be subject to change once we get more information.  

**DO IT TO IT. MAKE US LOOK GOOOOOD!**

If you or anyone has had things stolen or magically disappear from your bag at the track, like a phone or wallet, chances are this guy took it.

Tonight at about 11:00pm, a black male, about 6 feet tall wearing all grey and in his early to mid 20's stole money out of a late night runner's backpack. He dresses up in semi-athletic gear (all grey sweats) to look like he's working out and to blend into the grey concrete of the stadium seating. He'll take what's easiest and most valuable at the bottom, walk the stadium up, and out towards the bruinwalk crossing light.

Last year my girlfriend and her roommate had their phones stolen and he got away (this is how I recognized him tonight), and another friend's keys were taken by the same guy.I am sure he has stolen countless other valuables.

Tonight I was finishing up a run and saw this piece of shit loitering around someone's bag. My mindset is automatically ""This is the guy, go warn the people who are running."" So I warn them, as we approach he calmly skidaddles, and sure enough a wallet is missing. I tell him I've seen the guy before and we go up the stadium looking for him.

I confronted him as he walked out of the stadium with the person whose wallet was stolen. He was very negotiable and non-threatening, allowing us to search his pockets, his wallet, etc, but we found nothing indicating he stole anything. He said he wasn't a student but a resident of the area. I stupidly did not get his name. So our confrontation turned inconclusive, but as we walked back toward the stadium, lo and behold, we find victim's wallet on the ground, well away from anywhere he had been running or where his backpack had been. His wallet: empty of the cash that it had contained. 

My guess is that the guy will take things like cash that can't be proven stolen, and for phones he'll turn them off/remove batteries, and toss them in the adjacent bushes to return later in the safety of the middle of the night.

I am sick of this motherfucker getting away with his crimes, this is the second time I've seen it happen as I was there. Please, be careful what you bring with you to workout and let other people know as well. As a recap to identify him, here again are his identifying traits.

* Black male
* About six feet in height
* Early-mid twenties
* Comes at night
* Wears grey sweatpants and grey sweatshirt
* Claims to be a resident of area and not a student
* Eerily agreeable
* Doesn't actually workout but lingers around bags/phones/stuff "	t5_2qscu	True

1338328781.0	ub10o	Why do people want to donate to UCLA after graduating?	unducks	34	10	51	"I'm sorry if this comes off as trolling, because I really don't intend it that way. I'm just legitimately curious. Why do people want to donate to UCLA? I'm about to graduate and I'm not even close to paying off my loans, and I'm already being asked to donate. I hear surprisingly little opposition to donations, and instead seem to hear a lot of people talk about ""giving back"" and owing the school something. UCLA charges for the majority of services offered already, and increasingly charges more. What's the temptation to give UCLA money beyond the thousands that you already have and are going to? 

I could understand directly donating to the scholarship fund and supporting giving financial aid to UCLA students, but why would you give money to the institution itself? [edit: cutting the point about sports - I hadn't understood that sports funding and education are entirely separate. the rest of my question still applies!]

Anyway, sorry again if anyone takes this as trolling. I just really don't understand it. Maybe it's because I transferred and was used to paying $20-$60/unit for most of the same resources and services and didn't have the same community experience that most four-year students had. I don't know. I just feel like I owe UCLA absolutely nothing beyond the money that it has already charged."	t5_2qscu	True

1318758324.0	ldz0r	Hi friends. Just a few updates (Competition/Flair/Facebook/Chat/other stuff):	jennz	26	2	5	"**1.** First off, 929 members? Holy crap! We're approaching 1k *reeeeally* quickly. Speaking of which, the [Grow a College Subreddit Competition](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/from-aberystwyth-to-york-update-on-grow.html) ends in **8 Days**!! We're [moving up on the charts](http://www.reddit.com/college?sort=top/), and we have a real shot at placing. Here's some suggestions on how you can help:

* It's simple, ~~we kill the batman~~ tell your friends! Seriously, if each of you just tell one friend, we can easily double our numbers. Introduce them to reddit (and utterly destroy their social life), and subscribe them. That's it.

* I made some super cool flyers [here](http://i.imgur.com/9pvPF.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/zDtDA.png) that you can print out and just post around the buildings and rooms your classes are in, around your dorms. *cough cough dorm residents with free printing cough cough*

* Chalk is pretty cool. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/l2m9l/what_happens_when_your_moderator_is_an_art_major/) was something a friend and I did around campus. You can be less fancy and just write ""reddit.com/r/ucla"" in the corner of the chalk board in your lectures. Feel free to add a little alien or something for a touch of fancy. Ask for permission... i guess.

**2.** WE HAVE [FLAIR!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ldw58/flair/). This the cool little tag next to my name. Get yer own now! 

**3.** Our [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/198370070197972) has 264 members?! So much so that we've lost our ability to do group chat through the Facebooks. Have no fear, with help from nullren, we have set up an [IRC chat via freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23reddit-ucla). These chats are super fun and are an easy way to get in touch with people to arrange meetups. Speaking of which, our most recent Ent meetup was a great success. Most fun i've had in a while.

**3b.** Which brings me to the next point: yes, alcohol and other various substances are integral to college, but just be cautious of what information you post. Especially in facebook; since it's out of the jurisdiction of ""reddiquette,"" and it uses real names, please do not post any sort of incriminating information regarding you, other members, or this subreddit. Remember, we're still representing UCLA. If you find a message of yours mysteriously disappeared, it's probably because I deleted it and feel free to use whatever euphemisms and innuendos to reword it. Don't want no troubles, ya dig?


As always, if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to message the mods. Here are also some recent [/r/ucla statistics](http://i.imgur.com/KRNVk.jpg) if you're interested.

1316399703.0	kk2fb	Protip #17: Where to get your booze in Westhood	thehomie	30	6	17	"In a word: **RiteAid** 

* Ralphs hyperinflates the cost of just about everything except box wine. Go there often enough and you'll actually forget that you're getting ripped off. 

* Compared to Ralphs, cases of beer are always at least $6 or $7 cheaper at RiteAid; daily deals on 12 packs can be good, if you feel like spoiling yourself; a handle of liquor is often up to $15 cheaper; they have cups and balls; you'll avoid the gnarly late-night Ralphs 2-checker / 30 people lines.. Be wary though: if you walk in with a group of people, **they check everyone's ID**, every time. If one person doesn't have theirs or isn't over 21, they won't sell to you. 

* Trader Joe's, needless to say, is good for your 2-Buck-Chuck needs (bitches love 2-Buck-Chuck). Stay away from Simpler Times - drink 2 or 3 and your stomach will have you remembering just how simple times were before that. TJ's also has some great deals on good liquor. (When I felt fancy, I'd get a liter bottle of Jameson's there for $20; Ralphs prices the 750ml at around $30.)

* *Never* go to that liquor store (that only sells beer / wine) across from the Chevron.. for anything. The dude who runs the place doesn't put prices on anything and will arbitrarily charge you up to 100% mark-ups on anything, depending on how stupid he thinks you look.

Since we have 842 readers on this page and the 1st place college is Cal (I think?) with roughly 1600, if most readers here get at least 2-3 friends to simply go on the ucla subreddit, I'm pretty sure we can grow quite a bit within the next few days.

Before you come in with the big ""boo USC sucks shenanigans,"" I'd like to say that I'm actually a big UCLA fan too (a lot of my friends and family go there, have high respect for academics, beautiful campus, good dining hall food, etc). Thought I was going to be a Bruin since sophomore year of high school, but as things turned out, became a Trojan instead (and at times I regret this). But I digress... The rivalry between the two schools is awesome in my opinion, especially since we're cross-town rivals. Its cool to say that my house is a house that is divided.However, I feel that at USC, the rivalry has gone way too far, and in some cases, is quite offensive. With the USC Memes Facebook page and what not, I found some of the memes to be quite vulgar and offensive (even though I'm not a Bruin). Memes that trash-talk UCLA grads as Baristas at Starbucks or cashiers at McDonalds, saying that UCLA grads will not get jobs. UCLA not being a ""real school,"" mocking the large Asian population there, etc. Bring up the word UCLA in a subject with students on campus results in ""ew UCLA sucks, like omg."" I even saw a new one today, shirts that say ""Don't be Bruined,"" etc. Mocking UCLA as not being a ""real school"" and what not is not only showing my disappointment in my school, but is quite offensive to me. 


I was wondering, is there this high level of hatred towards USC at UCLA? I'm guessing it would be less so because the majority of the students at UCLA are from California, and the rivalry has all just been there while at USC, many of the students are from out of state and even out of the country and are just jumping on the bandwagon of UCLA hatred. I get the rivalry, and I'm all for it. But I feel that it is somewhat over-exaggerated here at USC. I know you have jokes that a trojan can only be used once, or that USC is really a school of spoiled children (I can tell you that is true). Does it ever go the the extreme? 

tl;dr Is the rivalry as exaggerated in UCLA as it is at USC?

Now it's here:



I graduated last June. I've got law school apps out and needed to find a job in the mean time. I was looking specifically to work at a law firm to bolster my apps and for that reason wasn't totally overwhelmed by that 'oh-shit... I-should-have-studied-science' existential moment. In 3 eternal weeks of searching, I managed to land 4 interviews and received job offers at the better 3 firms. I was ultimately even able to pseudoleverage one offer over another. I now work full-time for a top firm in a position with basic, but sometimes interesting responsibilities. I make a modest, but livable wage, and I get full benefits. This was accomplished with an unremarkable GPA (~3.5), generic softs, a degree in Philosophy (no double, no minor), a few months previous relevant part-time experience and - most importantly, I think - **the ability to interview well:**




- **DO YOUR RESEARCH** about the place to which you're applying: know as specifically as possible what they do and who does what.


- **SHOW UP EARLY..** my target is ~20 minutes..  If your interview is at 3:00pm and you show up at 2:50, you're late. 


- No, really.. **DO YOUR RESEARCH**.. Have questions lined up about specific people, what they've done / are currently doing, and express your interest. People love an audience, but be *cool*; don't brownnose. People want more than anything to be able to tolerate, ideally even enjoy the company of the people they're working with. In an interview, you're trying to get your interviewer(s) to 1) remember you, and 2) remember that they like you more than the other applicants. If you manage to break the wall, one candid conversation can go a very long way. Example: one of the managing partners of the firm I currently work for has a sports law blog. I came in with his last few entries fresh in my mind.. the two of us talked about the state of Bruin basketball for a full 15 minutes while the other two people in the room listened in and laughed... At my previous job, I googled one of the partners (who happened to interview me) and saw that he owns a bar in Hollywood offering a bunch of microbrews. I've worked in bars / restaurants and spent 4 years in college.. I casually brought up his bar.. We talked about beer and whiskey for 30 minutes of my 35 minute interview. I got the offer the next day. 


- Finding common ground with your interviewer is important, but don't force it. It's probably better to **BE ARTICULATE** in what you say (viz: only speak when you actually know what you're talking about) than to uncomfortably pick at the conversation, trying desperately to keep them talking. Still, as a general rule of thumb, try to get them to talk more about themselves and their business than you talk about yourself and your ""accomplishments"" (however counter-intuitive that may seem). You're 20-something.. Odds are you haven't done anything terribly remarkable, and that's perfectly understandable; even expected. In any event, they've already got your resume. They know what you're selling.. 


- **DRESS WELL** ... Really, this is so often overlooked, especially given what a powerful tool it can be. When it comes to being taken seriously, you wouldn't believe the general disparity between well and poorly-dressed people. In an interview, the way you're dressed accounts for one of the strongest, most lasting impressions you can make, and it's probably the only aspect of an interview that's totally under your control -- don't squander potentially free points. Dressing well means spending a little more on a pair of shoes / shirt / slacks / haircut than your normally would. And if you don't think you have good style (or if you know you don't...), find someone who does and get them to go shopping with you. It shouldn't be hard. Whether they'll admit it or not, the fashion-conscious love being asked to do fashion-related things. And just for the record, every man needs at least one *good* suit (stay away from polyester and H&amp;M). About women, I know less, but you should be aiming somewhere in between the church and the club. Also, when in doubt, overdress. That should never count against you. 


- Wait one day after the interview and then **FOLLOW UP**. Email or phone call. Up to you. Express your thanks, your continued interest and that the interview was a pleasure. That's it. You already put in the work during the interview. The follow up is just to remind them how cool you were. 


- Try not to be devastated by rejection(s). You go / went to UCL-motherfucking-A. We quite literally run this city (huge, established and heavily nostalgic alumni network). Keep at it and shit will work out. Remember: jobs are like women in college --&gt; a numbers game. Put yourself out there earnestly and often enough, and it's only a matter of time before one gives you the nod. That said, be selective if you can afford to be. Don't stop looking for the dime piece just because a ""6"" is willing to jerk you off in the bathroom for a while. Better jobs = better experience = better on your resume = a better next job / grad school app. 



Source: I've had a ton of interviews in my short time for a ton of different things - plenty of paid jobs in plenty of different fields.. schools, scholarships, clubs, internships, volunteer positions, etc. - and I've gotten offers after each of them; this most recent 3/4 being the only exception. The above is arbitrary advice based on what I think I did right and what I noticed I did differently from the often more-impressive-on-paper people I was competing with. I've also always asked (and have been told) what stuck out in my interviews.

One of our fellow redditors, iltadilt500, is having a little party on Friday and has invited us to come over. There will be plenty of space, and we can all sit together and chill somewhere if people don't want to mingle with the party. There will be drinking going on and smoking is also an option (though this isn't an ent meetup).


It'll start around 8:30, and there's a band set to play at 9. The meetup can last as long as people still want to stick around.

The address is 500 Landfair, across from the Co-op housing. It should be easy to spot us, but I'll definitely be there. I'll be the short blonde chick wearing a white kitty face t-shirt."	t5_2qscu	True

I thought I was going to make so many friends and join so many awesome clubs and take so many interesting classes and learn so much and figure out what I want to do with my life...but...I haven't. 

I feel like such a failure. I'm currently a second year, and this year has been significantly better than my first year, during which, i made basically zero friends and got involved in nothing besides going to class/tutoring/attempting to befriend people in my dorm. (My fault, I know). 

This year I did explore more...I joined one pretty big organization I'm passionate about and made a ton of acquaintances and a couple of good friends. I decided I'm sticking with trying for a B.S. even though my classes are still insanely difficult for me. 

But I still just feel really disconnected from UCLA. I don't feel like I've found my niche and I'm starting to think maybe its too late and I just shouldn't have come here. I don't really understand why everything has just gone so...unexpectedly. I promise I'm not totally creepy or whiny or ugly or something in real life but I have no school spirit, my GPA is basically crap, I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life, I feel like a social failure because of the number of failed sort of friendships/relationships I've had here and I still get kind of homesick pretty often...

I'm betting that the fact that finals are just around the corner and my classes are totally dominating me right now has something to do with this mood....but still. I guess I'm just curious if anyone else feels/has felt like this/if anyone has advice or could tell me where and how they met cool people here? Maybe I'm just a douche magnet/smell bad or something?

So I am 33 and finishing up my undergrad at UCLA. I transferred in a year ago from a school in AZ, and I knew no one in Los Angeles. It has been tough for me on campus. Everyone is nice enough, and no one ever seems creeped out when they learn my age.

But Here is my problem. There are so many beautiful females on campus and in my classes! I am afraid that once they find out my age they'll get creeped out and think I am some old pervert barking up the wrong tree. I look really young (I get 24-26 mostly), and have a fairly youthful personality. I have made a few ""study buddies"" with girls in my classes, but I never push for anything more.

So yeah, is 33 a creepy age for a lot of you? I am a veteran of the Air Force, I served 6 years honorably and was a little busy fighting 2 wars that I didn't get to take many classes while I was in. Now I'm out, finishing up my degree. I also have a full time job. So no, I am not a slacker living at home with his parents stalking 18-22 year old girls on campus.

Now I party 3 times a week getting completely hammered, I barely lift, my diet is atrocious, and I have no motivation to study anymore. Last quarter I got a 2.5 and I feel like my grades are going to be even worse for winter. I did average at best on my finals and got a C minus on a research paper I had to turn in 10th week. I worked my ass off on that paper and to have my professor tear it up hurt. At this point I've become content with C's which at the start of the school year would have been unacceptable. I'm a north campus major so my only real options as far as landing a well paying job are the CIA/FBI, or any other federal job at that caliber, or law. I would like to work for either the CIA or department of state but I doubt I would get a job at either one of those institutions because of my past marijuana abuse (they ask about your past use of drugs and alcohol while you're hooked up to a polygraph). I thought about law but after taking the practice lsat cold and getting a 142 on it I feel like the dumbest person here. To make things worse I have no motivation to go out and chase girls.

I fire breathe and I'm learning fire poi.  I've got a set of poi and a bunch of lamp oil (or, I will once I get myself to a hardware store).  I'm going to be playing with fire either Saturday or Sunday late night (15 or 16, I'll let you guys know), and I'll teach fire breathing/poi.  I'll get you specific time/location later on in the week.

Anyway, if you're interested, let me know!  And if you have fire toys of your own, bring them. :)

This last year was awful academically for me. I flunked out of the Econ major, and I've had to switch to Political Science last quarter, which is what I wanted to do all along. I'm going to have to retake a class in the Fall, and I'm worried about applying for graduate programs with a big fat ""F"" on my transcript. I can still graduate with a 3.5 if I make straight As until I graduate, but I feel like such a fool for pursuing a major I suck at for so long. 

I feel like my time at UCLA has been such a fail. Commuting for three years has been so hard on me personally, and I hate not feeling like no one would miss me if I wasn't here. I don't know what I'm going to do after I graduate, and I'm freaking out about that too. I want to make my last year count--what can I do?

As a third-year student in a research laboratory, quite a few underclassmen have been asking me how exactly to go about beginning research at UCLA. Instead of answering them, I've decided on making this post instead!* Hopefully, this post will help anyone feeling a bit in the dark about research here at UCLA.

Of course, my experience is within the Life Sciences. Any other majors and fields may have a different procedure for going about on the research train. 

Let's begin!

To actually start research, you'll need to find a lab opening through [SRP 99 (Student Research Program)](http://www.ugeducation.ucla.edu/urc-care/srp.htm). Take a look around, especially at the 'getting started' link. Click on 'Research Positions', download the pdf, and find a few (read: many!) labs that you find interesting. Send each lab a well-written email containing a bit about yourself, your reasons for joining, and anything else relevant to the lab (animal care experience, etc.). If all goes well, you should be called in for an interview and if that goes well, congrats! You are now officially an undergraduate research assistant! Get to know your principal investigator (PI) and research mentor closely!

After completing at least one quarter of SRP 99, and if you choose to continue research at that same lab, you can apply for an upper-level research course (199, 198). This course is two quarters and results with a full scientific paper of your research. 


For those already completing an upper-level research course, here are two links to publish your paper:

[Undergraduate Science Journal](http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/USJ/) For papers of any scientific field.

[Autapse: Student Neuroscience Journal](http://www.autapse.org/Autapse/Home.html)



And of course, feel free to discuss your research stories, tips, or whatever you wish. 

Ciao!

And now I'm sitting here, single, thinking about how much of an idiot I am for not proposing to her when I had the chance. Trust me guys, if you meet a girl you're seriously digging, TIE IT DOWN. I am now in grad school where most are either engaged or married. It's hard finding a girl that made me as happy as she did. My point is this: there is no better situation than meeting your future wife and the future mother of your children in university. There was all sorts of couples I would see at UCLA, walking by holding hands. My advice to them is if it's going great, lock it down and make it greater. UCLA is a time to not only focus on academics in hopes of a career one day, but a time to focus on love in hopes of a family one day. Time goes by quicker than you think.

I'm just really sick of these people and their signs.  I know they think it's important to evangelize, but I've been harassed by people with similar signs before.

 I think it's really rude to tell people who you know jack shit about that they're going to hell because they don't share your beliefs.  I've seriously been told by them, upon politely declining a flyer/pamphlet, that I had to ""believe or die"" and ""worship or burn."" 

Just to clarify, I have no problem with the people or their beliefs unless they come out and try to shove their doctrines at me.  I wish they could just get tables and stand at the tables, and not stand in my way and yell at me and push papers at me.  

Wonder if anyone else feels similarly, or if you think they are justified, I'd like to hear your opinion.

I know that many of you will be around UCLA for the summer, taking classes, doing research, working, etc. In any event, I had an interesting idea that I thought I'd share with you all. 


Besides for being a time to relax and have fun, summer is also a great time to pick up a new hobby or learn something new. That being said, it's often very hard to teach yourself a new hobby and even harder to keep motivated, and most people (myself well included) don't have the free cash to pay for a tutor or instructor. Moreover, the UCLA student community is well-represented by people with all sorts of expertise, interests and talents. I thought it might be a good idea if we engaged in some sort of a ""summer hobby bartering program,"" i.e. if one person who is good programmer wants to learn how to draw, and somebody studying art wants to learn how to program, they can offer to teach each other over the summer. Of course, the bartering needs not be just between two individuals, and it might be better to do it in larger groups of people, or even community wide. I think this would be a win-win situation, as people get to learn new hobbies/skills/ideas from somebody with experience, and at the same time get to share one of their passions, without any of our precious, dwindling money disappearing any faster.


To get it started, here's what I'm able to offer (although I might update with more depending on what people want), and what I'd be interested in:


Offering: Math homework help, tutoring and general instruction. I'll be in the masters program in the math department next year (I'm a senior this year), and I have a good deal of tutoring experience. I can help with homework and tutoring for most upper- and lower- division math classes, and I can also help instruct people who want to self-study some area of math to prepare for classes or out of personal interest. (I'm a moderator of /r/math and /r/puremathematics, so I'm legit)


Looking For: I'd really love to learn a new instrument (I currently play a little piano, although I used to be better), preferably something with strings or a woodwind. 


Please give me your honest opinion and constructive criticism, and if you're interested, share what you're offering, and what you're looking for (not necessarily both).

Hey all!

Any and all Adventure Time fans at UCLA should know that Cartoon Network is sponsoring a House Party event on February 9. Fans of the show can currently submit an application to hold a House Party, and, if one of 1,000 chosen, will be sent an exclusive DVD of the new Fionna and Cake episode (""Bad Little Boy"") to watch before it airs. The Party Pack they will send to winners includes AT gifts and assorted merch. I'll let you guys comb over the House Party site for additional details.

We are one of the IFC fraternities (AGO) on Landfair. Now, the link at the top is for a ""conversation"" we submitted, one of the ways you can increase your chances of being selected to host. It would be awesome if we could get UCLA Redditors to boost up the various reactions and leave comments. We should have a video up tonight that one of our members is editing (various shots around campus) that will stand out from all the other vids applicants are posting, and combining that with our unique situation (most applicants are just families looking to host a small viewing party with their child's friends) we think we stand a fair shot of getting a host spot.

Any help with drumming up interest in our post would be greatly appreciated, not only for our sake (many of our members are AT fans and want to see the episode before it airs) but also for the sake of UCLA AT fans. This post, of course, constitutes an invite to all of you should we be chosen to host. AGO has recently hosted an event of ~150 people at our house, so we can accommodate a sizable group (and if needed will get screens other than our living room TV going). It is on a Saturday around Midterms, so if you want to take a break from studying this would be a fun way to hang out with other Bruins who like AT. "	t5_2qscu	True

Part of it has to do with academics, and another part of it has to do with a load of other bullshit that I'd rather not entangle anyone else with. I was wondering if anyone has ever been to the CAPS center on campus. I'd like to know if it is worth making an appointment, or if I would just walk out of there completely despondent. I would talk to family, but I'd just feel like a failure if I tell them anything. I'd talk to friends, but then I would feel judged.

This research study is being run by Fred Sabb, Ph.D. and James McCracken, M.D. from the department of Psychiatry and Deborah Estrin, Ph.D. in the department of Computer Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.
This research aims to develop smart-phone based tools to examine behaviors (e.g., personality traits, thought processes) related to attention and impulsiveness, with the goal of being able to better diagnose and treat syndromes associated with attention and impulsivity problems, like attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We plan to ask about 30 people to complete a series of questionnaires and tests on their phone or a phone provided to them for the study.
This study would take about 6 minutes of your time, 3 times a day, for 2 weeks. The initial interview and informed consent process typically take approximately an hour. You would receive a $50 gift-card for amazon.com for participating.

He said that he's there to spread peace, and the only way to spread peace is with love.  And, he said that the only way to get more love was to make it.  And that everyone should get comfortable with one another's bodies, b/c after all we're all just bodies and sex is the source of love so we should all just make love... it sounded like he was advertising an orgy... but let me know if anyone went to that party he was throwing, i'd love to know how it was."	t5_2qscu	True

I know lots of people proclaim interest and promise to be there but end up with an excuse as to why they were not there.  Please, if you say you're going to come, please do so.  There are people who put work and plan ahead for these things.  It kinda sucks when people flake.  

If not, my condolences go to you, but there will be other meetups.  Despair not.  

Details:  Bruin Bear.  Time and Date TBA.  We will have a sign, and/or I will wear a reddit shirt.  "	t5_2qscu	True

1372223970.0	1h39i0	UCLA has (probably) just won the Capitol One Cup for best overall Mens sports program of 2013.	UclaBruins12	14	0	6	"It comes down to UCLA or Indiana.

UCLA is currently in 26th place in the Cup Standings with 32 points. Indiana has 76. It all boils down the to the final post-season baseball poll, which will be released later this month. 

Winning the CWS will put the Bruins atop that the baseball ranking, giving them 60 points towards the Cup, and 92 points total. This would beat Texas A &amp; M which currently leads the poll with 88 points. Indiana would have to place 5th or better in the final baseball poll to catch UCLA; that would earn them 18 points on top of their current 76, finishing with 94 overall. This is possible, given their run in the CWS, but somewhat unlikely. Hard to say. Go Bruins."	t5_2qscu	True

The only people out flyer-ing are members of minority groups. The entire thing appears to be that.

80% of the money raised would go to minority groups on campus and the only one i can justify is the LGBT center.

1367825990.0	1ds51a	Is anyone else in Rieber Hall sick of the elevators being broken?	brad8675	16	2	10	They have been broken off and on for basically the whole year. Also my floor has experienced many delays in repairs. Our water fountain was broken for almost a whole quarter, a pipe was leaking in the girls restroom for a long time, and it took them months just to fix a door on a shower stall. Is maintenance this terrible for everyone? I feel like if I got a wrench or a screwdriver I could fix things faster than them.	t5_2qscu	True
