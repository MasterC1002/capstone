Already got into the spirit of things this morning by donating $100 to GLAAD (straight, but I got your back friends) and another $100 to the Secular Student Alliance.

I'm going to cap max donation at $500, but if we do hit the cap, I will donate an additional $200 to another worthy charity (probably ASPCA, but would take suggestions).

Edit - Whoa.  That was quick.

some extra info:

Friday, 21 September 2012
Pay attention to the date, because what you are about to read might confuse you as to what century the following takes place.

A 27 year old owner of a Facebook novelty account has been arrested by Greek Authorities. The charge?

Blasphemy.

As the official police announcement states in more detail, the young man was arrested for ""Malicious Blasphemy and Religious Hubris"", through Facebook. Along with the blaspheming contents of that page, the Electronic Crimes Unit received thousands of digital petitions, coming from denizens from across the world.

The creator of the Facebook group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS/ELDER PASTITSIOS, has been under the sights of Christian clerics, religious people and the Greek fascist political organization Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn representative Christos Pappas had imposed a related question in the Greek Parliament some days prior to the arrest, concerning the satirical Facebook Group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS/ELDER PASTITSIOS, claiming that ""this user is using hubris, irony and is attempting to ridicule this Holy person of Greek Orthodoxy Elder Paisios (the monk, whose supposed modern day miracles are being satirized by the Facebook page in question). Shining examples of such Hubris are posts like 'Elder Pastitsios the Patsafarian (sic)', 'The New Miracle from the Elder in Serres', as well as numerous taunting and indecent photographs""

""The Miracle Of The Elder At Serres"" was a bogus article created by the author of the Facebook group GERONTAS PASTITSIOS, which he wrote as an experiment to test how easily fraudulent stories concerning miraculous occurrences can be spread wildly among religious and far-right winged blogs.
It described a supposed miracle that happened at the Greek Region of Serres: In short,  a drug using teenager was involved in a motorcycle accident which sent him on a coma at the local hospital. The doctors told the teen's mother that they would not be able to keep him in life support for much longer, and that she should prepare for the worst. The grieving mother prayed to God, and on the same night she dreamed of the Elder Paisios, who told her that her son would be well and good and that she should not grieve any more for her prayers were heard and answered. The mother returned to the hospital the next day, to a completely stunned group of doctors who informed her that not only had her son woken up without the smallest injury, but that all traces of drugs had disappeared from his body. The mother and son left the hospital on foot, and the son has been praying to God ever since, never touching any drugs again.

Link to the story here: http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/1114/1224326575203.html

One of the saddest aspects of this story is that in theory, Irish law allows for termination in cases where the mother's life is in danger. 80% of voters are in favour of abortion where the mother's life is in danger. But no political party in Ireland has risked legislating for it yet. This woman knew that the foetus inside her was dying. She accepted that it could not be saved but she had the chance to save herself and was denied that chance by discriminatory religious beliefs and an outdated legal system. "	t5_2qh2p	True

1370607283.0	1fuv58	So a Native American girl gets no diploma and a $1000 fine for putting a feather in her cap, while a Christian valedictorian disobeys rule by reciting prayer and gets standing ovation.	GeneralMalaiseRB	24298	21338	2422	"It's graduation time, and I've been seeing a lot of goofy stories from around the country. Students getting in trouble for this or that. One guy was denied his diploma because he blew a kiss to his mother whilst walking the stage. Ridiculous. Anyhow, I saw a story recently about a part-Native American girl who put an eagle feather in her cap, against school rules. She was denied her diploma until paying a $1000 fine to the fucking school. What? So now the dumb story going around is a valedictorian of some South Carolina public high school, who tore up his valedictorian speech and began reciting the ""lord's prayer"" instead, and talking about his religious upbringing. This sparked ""wild applause and cheers"" by the crowd. The district has said that no disciplinary action will be taken.

Now, I don't think any disciplinary action is needed. I don't agree with prayer in general, because I think it's dumb. But the guy doesn't need a punishment for saying ""Screw the man"" and reading his little poem. But this just adds to how fucking insane it is to punish that other girl for a FEATHER in her cap. And extorting $1000 out of her in the meantime? It's deplorable. It's a different school in a different district in a different state. I'm not suggesting these stories are connected in any tangible way. 

It's just frustrating to me that when reading these two stories side by side, it comes across as ""Hey you Indian, stop expressing your culture! This is no place for your savagery. No diploma for you, and now you owe me money for some reason!  Oh, hey Christian kid, you weren't supposed to be inciting prayer at this event. Ahh well, whattya gonna do? You little skamp, hehehe.""

Posting this on reddit and announcing seems unnecessary but I was really impressed how well this worked on doctors without borders donations. I could not contribute to that because of financial reasons but at least I could plant trees. 

Not doing for karma, its a self post. The intent of this post it to trigger more people to do something good even if they cant financially contribute. 

Edit: I am not native english speaker. I meant to say ""will"" instead of ""would"" in the title. I apologize for the mistake.

**Edit 2:** Okay, I did not expected 4800+ trees (as of 3PM 12/16/11). I accept the challenge. [I already started to look for places where I can legally plant trees.](http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/nfldh/tcs_i_accepted_a_challenge_to_plant_one_tree_per/) It would not be all at the same place and the same time but I promise to stay true to my words.

**Edit 3:** Thanks a lot for showing all the love. I got really nice support from many of you guys and thanks for your suggestions on how to do really make it happen. I posted a help cry on my local [sub-reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/nfldh/tcs_i_accepted_a_challenge_to_plant_one_tree_per/) and people are really coming forward to help with this. I got around 40 people who are willing to give me a hand with the labor work. I will be also contacting local non-profits and national parks around town to get more support from them. Also one redditor is trying to get me in touch with one large firm in town, seems like they have a huge open space and they can use several hundred trees. I will keep working on this and will post the pictures as it becomes available. For all those who are saying that I am not gonna do it, please be patient and wait for pictures. This is something that can not be done overnight and needs some planning/resources. If you want to contribute to the effort, please plant one tree around you. I can post your pictures along with others in a future post if you PM me the link. Thanks!

You and your dad should come to my church and learn about them!"" in this ""I can't believe the miracle of life!"" type sing songy voice.

1308818973.0	i70iy	Today a fundamentalist christian blew my mind.		5957	3434	986	"I was having coffee and eggs in my local Waffle House when I overheard the cook talking to one of the servers and the subject of homosexuals came up.

The cook mentioned that while he didn't have any ill feelings toward ""the gays"", the bible condemned their actions as an abomination.  He went on to explain that he can't personally respect their decision to be homosexual because the bible is the infallible word of god.

It was pretty slow in the restaurant, so I decided to speak up and put in my two cents.  I asked him why he chose to respect that part of the biblical text but not other parts.  To which he replied that he respected every verse in the bible and always tried his level best to follow all the tenets, not just those in the ten commandments.

I mentioned that the verse he was referring to was Leviticus 18:22 ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind as if with womankind: it is an abomination.""  He nodded emphatically, ""Yeah!  That's it!""

I then pointed out that in the very same book, one chapter later Leviticus 19:19 god forbids wearing any clothing of mixed fabrics, or at least mixed of linen and wool. ""... neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.""
and James 2:10 ""For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.""

I explained my point that according to scripture it is just as bad to wear clothes of mixed fabric as it is to be homosexual.  I asked him why he thought that we put so much emphasis on the gay thing but not the mixed fabric thing.  I posited that it was much more likely that both of these things are meaningless and harmless and that our society likes to pay more attention to the gay verse because it suits our political and social ends but that we all treat other parts (like the fabrics verse) as obvious silliness that we don't need to pay attention to anymore.

Here's the part where he blew my mind.  Any one of us who has debated any point with a fundamentalist knows that logic and reference to scriptural contradictions and fallacy are almost always completely ineffectual.  You never get anywhere debating a christian.
I was expecting more of the same from this guy but after I laid it out like that he kind of just stood there with his head tilted, obviously grinding out this conundrum with great mental effort.  He walked away and went back to cooking a new order but eventually came back to me and said, *""Man, I never knew any of that stuff.  You've got a real good point.  I guess not everything in the bible is really worth taking seriously and I can't think of a good reason to pick and choose between them.  I reckon gay people have just as much right to be gay as I do in choosing what I wear.""*

I decided not to get into the difference between fashion choices and being born gay.  That's the first time something like that has ever happened to me.  I really couldn't believe it.


**EDIT** 
I was brought up in the church and was formerly a youth minister who took my faith very seriously, especially when I started to doubt it.  This was a particular thing that I had thought about on multiple occasions, that's why I knew the verses to reference."	t5_2qh2p	True

......................................................................

Inspired seeing all you guys giving selflessly. I'm part of the 1 percent. I  of all people can afford to give more than most. So I'm relying on you to make it hurt. Do your worst.

I will post the total amount after the time limit.

**Edit:** Throwaway account so no karma whoring. Also I will let reddit decide on the charity.

**Edit:** Saw a post from someone in a similar income bracket, did a rough calculation of my own wealth, felt ashamed, long story short: **it's now $21 per upvote. I will hold myself to this.**

**Edit:** For those asking for personal/private donations, I apologize but the money will be going where reddit decides.

**Edit:** all my comments in this thread are getting downvoted. But in my first thread they all got upvoted. This doesn't make *cents* (get it! I made a reddit pun joke hahahahahahahhahah hahaha h haa hahaha  ha ah ah ahhhahhh    mmmmmmmmmmmm syrup). It all ties into my 1% theme. It's like the best mystery novel you ever read!!!!

**Edit:** I FELT A GREAT DISTURBANCE ON REDDIT ... LIKE A MILLION DISTANT VOICES OF BUTTHURT CRYING OUT AT ONCE AND THEN SUDDENLY...GONE.

There is a strict separation between Church and State. Officially, we are a catholic country but nowadays we have mainly agnostics and atheists, our churches stay empty on sundays.


We have many different religions, and many different cultures here in Belgium. None of them posed a big problem, but Islam really is an exception.

What I have learned is that Islam is not a religion like any other. Let me explain: Most religions and most cultures are compatible with Belgian culture and law, and just fit in. Islam however, is not just a religion as how we here define ""religion"". Islam is a whole package. Islam contains a political system, economic system, justice, education, culture and religion.

When Muslims come to Europe to live their lives, this creates impact.

We have Police here who's job is to make sure that the citizens follow the law. People with Islamic roots are showing some kind of immunity against the police. They show this in how they behave towards the police, by not accepting the police as an authority. They literally say and admit that Allah, the Islamic God, is the only authority.

Every week there are cases of violence against police and it always shows the same pattern: 1 Muslim gets arrested, and then suddenly a group of sometimes up to 50 Muslims gather and attack the police. This has happened so many times that the police has decided to no longer patrol certain neighborhoods, because their authority is no longer accepted there so they are just outnumbered by the ( Islamic ) civilians. I'm not speculating about the future here, this is the reality here today in 2012.

Then there is education. We have Belgian laws which guarantee a minimum level of education. It's a book full of facts that must be taught in every school, they are called the ""end terms"". One of those subjects is evolution. The theory of evolution must be taught in both science class and history class. Creationism is not allowed. If a teacher teaches his pupils the theory of creationism instead of evolution, then this is against the end terms.

I personally know a teacher who had the task to teach evolution to her pupils. The children with an Islamic background, we are talking about 9 and 10 year olds here, said to her: ""You are talking bullshit, you are just a dumb woman, my parents tell us that we should not listen to you about this evolution crap, Allah has created us and all the animals."" They are ordered by their parents to not do any homework on the theory of evolution and they deliberately fail the tests. This problem is not limited to pupils. There are 20-year olds studying to become teachers, who also deny evolution. There are various reports of Islamic teachers who got their job as a teacher, and they are teaching creationism to Islamic children, denying evolution, and not following the end terms that are actually protected by law and by separation of church and state.


They not only deny the authority of the police, they also deny our education system and its rules.


Then there is the problem of food. Islam does not accept pork as ""clean"" food. Therefore, they do not buy food in our supermarkets. Instead, they build their own stores which do not allow the sale of pork or alcohol. Here I have an example of one of my relatives: a family member was celebrating her birthday at work. She gave away boxes of chocolates containing alcohol. She got a complaint from an Islamic employee that she apparently had not shown respect for his ""beliefs"" by not having any non-Alcoholic chocolates. This might sound like a stupid small issue but I'm trying to make a point here: I'm not talking about extremist Muslims here blowing themselves up, I am talking about the everyday Muslim.

Now economy. Belgium has banks, our banking system is interweaved with economy ( ok I know this is not the ideal period to start defending banks with all the economic mess we are into but still ... ). They do not use our banks: they keep their money in foreign banks located in Turkey, Morocco, Saudi-Arabia etc... because those banks follow certain Islamic rules. They are constantly draining and transferring money out of Europe. They do not accept our banking system because it's not compliant with the Islamic view of economy.

I know I'm writing a long text here, but I hope you are still with me, because there is an important point I want to arrive to: 

Justice.

The number of hate crimes against homosexuals is increasing every year. It started a few years back with taunting and attacking homosexual persons around areas with gay bars. Since last year, the first murders of gays have happened, by Muslims. No provocation, just hate crimes, hate against gays. The gay community is aware of areas in Belgium where they are no longer safe simply because they are gay. This wasn't the case 10 years ago. Then there are the increasing reports of honor killings. Just recently, a 22 year old Belgian bared the child of her 19 year old Islamic ex-boyfriend. The family of this Muslim had arranged a wife and a marriage for him, and this child would bring a shame on the whole family. That's why he and his nephew have killed this young 22 year old girl, to save the honor of the family.



I hope I'm getting my point across here. Although Islam is being defined as a religion, it is not just that. Islam is much more, it's a whole package, it's a culture, it's an entire social system.


And it's impacting with another system. It's not impacting with Christianity, it's impacting with the Western world. We can see it slowly unfolding here in Europe. Slowly but certain. 

Let me stress out that Muslims are more attached to their Islamic system, than the European people are attached to the Western system. This is because the Islamic system has a God as the authority, which is a more powerful psychological motivation, than the European people who just have the government as the authority. Muslims are therefore not showing as much indulgence as other Europeans, resulting in an increasing amount of rights for Muslims and a decreasing amount of rights for Europeans.


Other cultures and religions have had no problem with fitting in. But Islam is not just a religion. It's something different.


When ""Freedom of Religion"" was written in the Belgian law, it wasn't meant for something like Islam. This is the mistake and the problem that we are facing. And at this moment nobody knows how to deal with it.

**tl;dr** We should reconsider defining Islam as ""just a religion"""	t5_2qh2p	True

Wednesday evening, I was repeatedly asked if I ""had Jesus in my heart"". I kept saying it wasn't an appropriate conversation due to the fact it was my mothers best friend asking and they had been drinking. I finally told them that I was atheist. I had spoken with my mother and my sister about this before. I assumed the knew. There had been no backlash before. 

This was not the case. My mother and sister immediately jumped up and yelled at me about how I was going to hell. They then ran off and hugged each other hysterically while crying. They told me to leave and to not touch my daughter because there was something wrong with me mentally. My sisters boyfriend came at me yelling and throwing things. I then called the police because I was scared that someone was trying to hurt me. My family lied to the cops and they believed them. As the cops were leaving my mother assaulted me while tryig to take my phone. The cops didn't care about that either. I have been kicked out of their house. Today I have to go get my things and my daughter. They also stole my car keys so I have to try to get those today. They still have her and are trying to keep her which is kidnapping. I am in the process of trying to secure a place for her and I to live. I am honestly scared to go get her and my things. 


I cannot believe this happened. I feel like it is a dream. If you have been here, please give advice. If you haven't, feel free to ask anything. 


EDIT: wow I did not expect this much advice. Thank you everyone who has contributed. I will post an update for those who are interested in the outcome later tonight. Thank you all again...even the trolls. 

EDIT 2: I have secured a place to live with a family member. Thank you to the people helping to did somewhere for me. As well as to the ones 
offering a place to say. 

EDIT 3: I do not have a car so I have to wait to go get my daughter until my ride is here. Also, if you believe this is fake then don't comment. Message me directly. I am getting support and advice from people on here and don't want it screwed with by people who think I'm fake. My daughters birthday is in 3 months. Sometimes I say she is 4, sometimes 3. She is really close to 4. Feeling_frisky is my boyfriend. He posted a question about a situation I was involved in with my daughter and her father. He put it in a male point of view since he is male and posted from his account. 

LAST EDIT: I am done with this post. It has turned into pretty much only accusing me of being either fake, a troll, or and idiot. I thank everyone who helped and will be posting an update as soon as I can. If you have any questions, I will happily answer PM's. Thank you all again!"	t5_2qh2p	True

CMO_Ratchet	7486	5259	685	"I was out in the yard and I live on a corner so both my back and front yard have sidewalk running along them. I've got three dogs who go crazy any time someone goes by which is usually good as it has previously scared away some thugs but can cause trouble when this trio, two men and one woman were walking over asking for a minute of my time. I ushered the dogs inside, having a feeling I knew what was coming. They asked if I'd heard the good word and had their little pamphlets, normally I just play along to save myself some trouble ""Oh yes, sure have"" that way they don't try to give me the lecture. Today, I decided to be true about how I feel. Told them I'd heard the word of their religion and that of many others, I felt that if-and it was a pretty big if, there was a higher power that just living a good life and doing right by others ought to be enough and that I appreciated that they were doing what they were doing because they were being true to themselves and walking the neighborhood on a day that was super hot for Michigan.

I've got a pole barn sized garage and because I live on a corner it's only a few feet from the fence line and gates, I politely told them that I wasn't interested in hearing more about their religion but offered them in for some cold waters from the fridge and a brief bit of shade from the heat. Had about the best hour just talking with these strangers who did nothing but express gratitude to me for being honest, being polite and welcoming them in for nothing more than some bottled water and shade and similarly, I was impressed and thankful to them for respecting my opinions. 

We talked about the city, upcoming events and other nonsense things like pets and the garden I was working on. After about an hour they thanked me again for letting them rest in some lawn chairs and the water and went on their way...

Just felt like sharing, most of us know that every person who follows faith isn't one of the crazies we see posted online, mutual respect can be found and I'm not saying it's easy but it's possible if all sides understand opinion, right and boundaries.

TL:DR Had a surreal and great experience with door to door pamphlet pushers were the discussion about religion ended in seconds and talks about fruit pies and pets lasted an hour while I relaxed with strangers in the barn. Mutual respect is possible between those who believe and those who don't or don't follow model religion.

I'll try to make this as short as possible. For the past 11 years, beginning two months after I graduated high school, I've worked for the same company. I busted my ass and worked my way up the proverbial ladder. Not so much to a powerful position, but to a more than just good paying position. 

I worked a sales position for a fairly large company, but one that also dealt with a very narrow vertical market. Throughout the 7 years in this position, I busted my ass. 100+ hour work weeks were common. I never made it back home to visit family during holidays during these years either. I was always too busy working. The only thing that padded this was the nice bonuses and commission that I regularly got, even though I was too busy to actually use it. 

Fast forward to a little less than a year ago. I was requested to drop everything during a sales integration project and head back to corp HQ. Thinking that I was about to close this project, they were lining up another one and hopefully giving me another raise/promotion. 

It was a Tuesday morning. Upon arriving to the office, I was ushered into the CEO's office. There waiting was the CEO, COO and CHRO (which I didn't even know existed. They sat me down and plopped a fairly thick binder in front of me. Inside of it were about 500 printed pages of miscellanious screenshots from my facebook, [/r/atheism](/r/atheism), misc atheism blogs etc etc. Basically anything atheistic was highlighted and notated. 

I was informed that ""several"" of my fellow employees, including my few superiors, did not feel safe or confident working with me any longer after they found out I was a ""threatening"" atheist. My employment with the company ended after about a half hour of discussion and me just being floored with everyones level of ignorance. There was no use battling stupidity here. Even worse, there was no severance. 

I spoke with a close lawyer friend back where I lived (Los Angeles) and ended up discussing my situation with all of the partners in his law firm. They thankfully took my discrimination and wrongful termination case. 

Turns out that one of my co-works who I was friends with on Facebook discovered my religious status as ""Atheist"" on facebook and started spreading the word. At some point (probably when my LCD died) IT installed ""SpectorSoft"" on my laptop which supposedly took screenshots based on keywords or specific times, catching all my pro-atheism related viewings. 

My then ex-company tried to settle outside of court. Most likely because they realized they uber-fucked up. They tried to play it off as my co-workers not feeling ""safe"" around me. I refused to settle and began burning up my savings on lawyer and court fees. 11 months later, after tons of deliberations, court dates, conference calls, recordings, etc. The court ruled in favor of me. I will be compensated very nicely and all my lawyer fees will be paid for by my ex company. Just in the nick of time for my birthday tomorrow. 

I still accidentally have the laptop they gave me last year. Not out of spite, I just forgot to return it. I'm thinking of flying out to the company's headquarters, renting a Ferrari and dropping the laptop off in person. 

Cheers to you /r/atheism. Unfortunately there's a decent amount of arrogance here, but its usually outweighed by logic and reasoning. Thanks for being there for me even when you didn't know I needed it. 

As for my future, I've actually been working with a large chunk of my old clients. They jumped ship from my old company after they found out I left. I'm working for myself now and it's going great so far.

TL;DR - Fired for being an atheist and making my bible belt coworkers ""afraid"" of me. After almost a year of legal mumbo jumbo, the court ruled in favor of me. I have lots of monies coming to me now.

1286377257.0	dnlim	A Christian Minister's take on Reddit	demusdesign	5053	2929	1702	"So I am a minister in a Christian church, and I flocked over to Reddit after the Digg-tastrophe. I thought y'all might be interested in some of my thoughts on the site.

1. First off, the more time I spent on the site, the more I was blown away by what this community can do. Redditors put many churches to shame in your willingness to help someone out... even a complete stranger. You seem to take genuine delight in making someone's day, which is more than I can say for many (not all) Christians I know who do good things just to make themselves look better.

2. While I believe that a)there is a God and b)that this God is good, I can't argue against the mass of evidence assembled here on Reddit for why God and Christians are awful/hypocritical/manipulative. We Christians have given plenty of reason for anyone who's paying attention to discount our faith and also discount God. Too little, too late, but I for one want to confess to all the atrocities we Christians have committed in God's name. There's no way to ever justify it or repay it and that kills me.

3. That being said, there's so much about my faith that I don't see represented here on the site, so I just wanted to share a few tidbits: 

&gt;There are Christians who do not demand that this[edit: United States of America] be a ""Christian nation"" and in fact would rather see true religious freedom. 

&gt;There are Christians who love and embrace all of science, including evolution. 

&gt;There are Christians who, without any fanfare, help children in need instead of abusing them. 

Of course none of this ever gets any press, so I wouldn't expect it to make for a popular post on Reddit. Thanks for letting me share my take and thanks for being Reddit, Reddit.

Edit (1:33pm EST): Thanks for the many comments. I've been trying to reply where it was fitting, but I can't keep up for now. I will return later and see if I can answer any other questions. Feel free to PM me as well. Also, if a mod is interested in confirming my status as a minister, I would be happy to do so.

Edit 2 (7:31pm) [a few formatting changes, note on U.S.A.] For anyone who finds this post in 600 years buried on some HDD in a pile of rubble: Christians and atheists *can* have a civil discussion. Thanks everyone for a great discussion. From here on out, it would be best to PM me with any ?s. "	t5_2qh2p	True

There is a deeply evangelical christian family that lives in our little neighborhood. They are just angry, bitter, hateful neighbors to every one. No one likes them really. They have three younger kids that are completely isolated from the other kids and are home-schooled. Anyway, the wife/mother in this family got really sick and one of her kidneys failed. I'd say she's in her mid-30's or so. The remaining kidney was damaged and is literally running on borrowed time. She's doing twice daily dialysis and needs a new kidney very soon. The local HOA caught wind of the story and posted a little write up in the community newsletter about their situation. Since they are literally assholes to everyone around them, I figured it would go unnoticed altogether.

To my surprise, one of my neighbors just a couple of houses down from me stepped up to help. He met with the family and had himself tested for donor compatibility. He was a perfect match. He agreed right then and there to donate a kidney to this woman. The family was elated. No more waiting for a donor. Their prayers had been answered. Doctors were called, preparations were made, surgery was scheduled and everything was looking great. This guy was a local hero.

To celebrate, the family's church had a big event and invited their ""hero"" donor to come and pray with the family for all of God's blessings. The donor simply declined the invite, admitting he was an atheist, and that he was donating a kidney to help out another human being (that he had never met) and did not want any praise or recognition of any kind.

The (dying) wife/mother went completely apeshit. She had let an atheist into their house, around their kids. She was screaming and crying and ordered the donor to leave her house.

The following day, the woman's pastor, husband and brother-in-law went to the donors house and said they didn't want his kidney after all. No ""thank you"", no nothing. When he shockingly asked why they were refusing, he was told ""She doesn't want the blood of an atheist inside her body. She'd rather die first"".

An ambulance showed up at her house a few days ago (hence what started this conversation with my neighbor in the first place) and hauled her off to the ICU. She needs an emergency kidney donation immediately or she will most likely not survive. She still refuses an atheist's kidney.

The Story:
Police in Indianola, Iowa charge 14 year old Daniel Nadler with the murder of 16 year old James Doyle on June 27, 2010. There is very little press on the event, but here is an article on it:

http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2010/06/27/indianola-police-charge-16-year-old-with-murder/

In short, two teen friends argue over religion. One is religious, and the other is an atheist. The religious teen grabs a shotgun and shoots the atheist. This was not prosecuted as a hate crime. If religious teen is convicted; the most time he can serve is just over three years.

The judge in the case disagreed with the prosecutor and ruled that it was not first degree murder. He also ruled that Nadler would not be charged as an adult.  For whatever reason, killing someone because he is an atheist is apparently not a hate crime like it would be if the person were black, Jewish, or Christian. This means the worst that Nadler is facing is juvenile detention until he is 18 years old. Even that is questionable at this point.

The mother is pleading for justice: [link](http://www.whotv.com/news/who-story-doyle-family-shooting-100810,0,3732283.story)

From the comments section of that story:

That was brother. That was my big brother the one that was supposed to walk me down the aisle when it came my time to get married. The one who was my protector when I needed him. The one my 11 year old little brother was supposed to go to when he had girl problems or needed someone to talk to.

And now what? His life was taken over another child’s stupidity. My brother is dead because another child decided to be a cold-blooded murderer. He shows no remorse whatsoever for he has done. And I have been to every single court date we have had. I got to read the police report. I got to read the judge’s decision. 

There is SO much that you people along with the rest of them that you guys won't know and never will know. I think you all need to stop and think about what you’re basing your ""facts"" on. You haven't seen or read or even heard the things I have. So you need to stop and think before you going running your mouths about something you have absolutely no clue about. 

The judge said ""it wouldn't be in the communities best interest"" to put Dan in prison. Well that's bull crap. His decision was a career based move and that’s all it was. And you know what Judge Clogg has dealt with Daniels father before. And I don't find it to be fair that a Judge who has had Dan’s father in court before gets to make a decision like this regarding his son. 

How do we know that Ernest Nadler and Judge Clogg aren't the best of friends? What if they were and that’s what he's basing his decision on? There is no justice being done for my brother in this case. And it's wrong. I sat in court and saw the picture of my brother. Him lying there with blood on him. Him dead. How would you guys feel if that were your brother? Or your son or nephew? You wouldn't like it and you would be doing the same things my family is. You'd be trying to get him justice because you know he deserves it. 

My brother wanted to be a lawyer. He would have been a damn good one too. But no Daniel Nadler took all that away from him. He DECIDED James’s fate. And he decided his fate was to die right then and there. 

Daniel's family still gets their birthdays and Christmases with their son. We have to go watch my brothers YouTube videos just to hear his voice again. They make a simple phone call and get to hear his. If there was a way we could call my brother in Heaven then we would, but there isn't. They still have their son, and brother and best friend and we don't. They get to see him and hug him and talk to him and we sure don't. 

So stop and think about how you would honestly feel if that would have been your son or daughter. Or even YOU. You'd be feeling and doing the same things we are. And Daniels father and family could be heard. They could be telling their side on the news or to all of you. But they don't and that’s not our fault. So take a step back and think before you start judging my family. And saying things you have no clue about. Just think for a minute.

**Amanda Aswell:** ""No I don't.""

**Dobbs:** ""Why?""

**Aswell:** ""Uh, because I think miracle connotes a religious miracle and I think that this is completely due to modern science.""

**Dobbs:** ""Which is why its not a miracle in your mind.""

**Aswell:** ""No, its a lot of hard work and its a lot of education and its a lot of willingness to go out on a limb and try something new that nobody else is willing to try. Its amazing, its inspirational, its wonderful, but I don't think its a miracle."""	t5_2qh2p	True

A group of Iranian youth arranged an Ancient Iranian festival called *Ab-bazi* wherein people celebrate the sanctity of water by splashing it at each other. The festival was contacted through Facebook, and many, male and female, showed up in a park near the outskirts of Karaj, Alborz to have fun playing with water.

The Police force of Islamic Republic showed up, and although they let the festival go through, at the end, they arrested fifty people for 'offending norm of the Islamic society'.

This also happened last years, and the arrests were much more brutal. Nevertheless, Iranian youth resist the tyranny of Islamic doctrine and are not afraid of two hours of detainment. 

However the punishment is, the act of arresting people for splashing water at each other is disgusting and incompatible for the flow of any culture. What's worse, is that the actions of this undesirable regime is attributed to people who are fighting it, specially by Western people who view Iranian people in the same kin as their government and discriminate them based on their false dichotomy.

It's the new solution for parents who have kids that don't conform blindly to their religious and political views, let me explain:  After the initial shock of what I thought was a kidnapping, it was explained to me that my parents had arranged for me to attend Horizon Academy (http://www.horizonacademy.us/) because I admitted to them that I was atheist and didn't agree with a lot of their hateful views.  Let me give you a detailed run-down of my experience here:  To start off it's a boarding school where there is literally no communication with the outside world, the people who work here can do anything they want, and the students can do absolutely nothing about it.  The basic idea is that you're not allowed to leave until you believably adopt their viewpoints and push them off on others.  The minimum stay at these places is a year, an ENTIRE YEAR, that means no birthday, no christmas, no thanksgiving etc.; my stay lasted 2 years.  The day to day functioning of this facility is based on a very strict set of rules and regulations: you eat what they give you, do what they tell you (often just pointless things just to brand mindless submission in your brain), and believe what they tell you to believe.  Consequences for not adhering to these regulations include not eating for that day, being locked in small rooms for extended periods of time and the long term consequence of an extended stay.  There's a lot more detail and intricacies I could get into, but my main purpose was to spread awareness to the only group of people I feel like could do something about this.  Feel free to ask me anything about my stay, I could go on for days about some of the ridiculous things I went through.	t5_2qh2p	True

Offensive if I don't!	bayesianqueer	8596	6594	744	"Working in the ER last night, I treated a guy from a heavily Muslim country (studying abroad at our local college). He has a complaint that may be caused or exacerbated by alcohol, so as I do with everyone having this problem I ask: ""do you drink alcohol and if so how much?""

You would have thought I spit in eye slit of his mom's niqāb. Dude lost his shit and started screaming at me that I should know that alcohol has never passed his lips because he is a devout Muslim. I almost just got up and walked out (I'm your doctor, not your verbal punching bag, asshole).

However I looked him straight in the eye and said ""I don't look at the color or your skin or your accent or where you are from and make assumptions about you. That goes for being a Muslim, abstaining from alcohol, or bombing a plane or beating your wife.""

Dude stopped short and apologized. When I go in later to go over his results with him he says how he was thinking that he was making assumptions about how Christians in America think about Muslims and that's what made him so upset. Now I am not super out as an atheist at work, but I figured we have good security and if I am in for a penny...

Me: *Actually I'm not a Christian.*

Him: You're a Jew?

Me: *No, I'm an atheist.*

Him: (blink. blink. pause. laugh.) Ah, you had me going there! Now you will tell me you are married to a man.

Me: (Nodding and pointing to my badge with a small red A pin and a rainbow caduceus) *Both, actually.*

Him: (At this point I can almost see the cogs turning and shit shorting out in his brain. He's half freaked out but still in that introspective space about his religion and assumptions) Well maybe that's why you do not make assumptions about me. I think many people make assumptions about you.

Me: *You are exactly right.*

Him: Well tonight I just assume you are a good doctor!

And he didn't even behead me. ;)

**tl;dr Muslim exchange student gets offended, I end up telling him I'm a gay atheist and that makes it better?!?**"	t5_2qh2p	True

I lost my left leg in Afghanistan, iv accepted that and moved on I have a prosthetic leg and I rock the damn thing.  I served 6 years in the Corps and I don't regret a day of it.  Now back to the story, I was invited to a party to celebrate a friends younger brothers acceptance into college. Iv know the immediate family quite awhile and I know them very well.   However they had extended family in town also as well as friends.  It was a good time everyone was laughing and drinking overall enjoying themselves. I was wearing shorts ( the weather has just started getting warm here) and the grandfather of my friend asked  me what happen.  I explained and he said that it was gods will and I should be thankful to our lord to be alive .  I politely said I don't believe in God and if he was real I'd hope this wasn't his desire.  Apparently that was the wrong thing to say, he stood up and told me the reason I lost my leg was that I turned my back on the lord stating that the true reason it happen was to get me out of the service because I did not deserve to wear the uniform.  I said my beliefs had nothing to do with my ability to serve and I had stood up I was quite angry.  He was also standing at this point but he was also yelling. He told me that i didn't need to be around his family that I was a horrible influence on his grand children.  He then proceeded to POINT at my leg and say "" that's what happens when you deny the lord, you are punished "".  I was to mad to see straight.  I bit my tongue literally, then  stood up and excused myself.  I left without another word.  Im
Sorry for the wall l text.  I hope some of you guys stuck around and read it. Thank you   


Tl;dr I was disrespected heavily due to my lack of faith and had my appearance and my sacrifice insulted/mocked.

Edit;   Wow.  Did not expect this many people to read my rant.   Thank all of you, so much.  It means a lot, you guys are so supportive. I try to reply to every comment and message. More are always welcome. 

Edit 2;   I must go, I will be back and I promise to try and reply to everyone.    Also someone just offered to send me reddit gold. Instead of doing that if you plan on spending any money at all.  Please donate to the wounded warrior project.   Other hurt vets need it.  And why helped me get on my feet.   Thank you guys so much for listening. 

Edit 3;  I met with my friend. He apologized.  everything is fine.  We agreed he was stupid. But we are happy.   On an even more important note. This thread has gotten donations to wounded warrior. So many of you have given.   It mean SO much to me and even more to the vets you help.  Thank you guys.   From the bottom of my heart.  I mean it.  Also I am still trying to reply to everyone.

Last edit.  Tank you guys so much. This got way bigger than I expected.  Holy crap.  I'll keep replying for a bit.  But I appreciate all the comments/messages.  I really appreciate everyone who donated to the wounded warrior project.  It means more than I can say.   You guys are amazing.   Also, any of you ladies like metal legs, let me know.   

Thank you all.     "	t5_2qh2p	True

So i decided to buy one for Westboro Baptist Church, a terrible cult that pickets dead soldier funerals and has the current domain name of GodHatesFags.com. 

Im hoping to reach out to r/atheism to help me sell this domain name to a porn website. Since they hate gays so much it would be even better for this to be a gay porn website. Having this domain name pop up under theirs on a google search would be the best possible scenerio.

Cost me $107 to register. Anything over that i will donate to Doctors Without Borders since that seems to be a great organization r/atheism loves.

edit:
What if we used it to sell pixels and make a million dollars like ""The Million Dollar Homepage"" did? Sell pixels in for $1 in 10x10 blocks to porn websites. :) I know DWB would love a cool mil :)

Unfortunately, I never met him before he passed, but I would have loved to, as an old atheist in the Southern U.S. is hard to come by (and basically my entire family is religious).

From what my aunt told me, I knew he was a reclusive man, but I didn't know why until I happened upon this letter in his office: 

http://i.imgur.com/3MepTjj.jpg

Religion took just about everything away from this man; its influences on the people around him destroyed his life. They might have forgotten him, but I won't.

My Response: I can hate the beliefs but not the believer; so I hope you would hate the sins but not the sinner...  It doesn't mean that we don't agree at one aspect in life, that we do not have a common ground at all. Let love and compassion be our common ground. Isn't that what any religion preaches anyway? 


Dad: Even satan acknowledges the existence of God. but then you do not believe in Satan. That is the greatest HELL you will be - LIMBO. No meaning, no purpose. Just going by the flow, and waiting for your turn to die. You are confused, that is because your heart is clouded by your reading. You are right religion will not save... but not believing in God will damn your soul. My goodness. Whatever you have been through, do not shut Him out. Love emanates from Him. It is you who allowed your belief to get in the way. Your ways, your ill-manners and disrespect for your parents are manifests of the presence of the devil in your life. We have been praying for you, every day without miss. You are under grace because of our love and prayer, but God have mercy on your soul. You are blinded because you want to be liberated. We have to part ways. And I will pray doubly hard that you will find your way back. Go enjoy your empty life.


My Response: That's an illogical jump of conclusion. Very stereotypical and generalized. It takes a person with an open mind to comprehend atheism. Bill Gates was an atheist but was a good charitable man. So your statement is invalid and completely null. Sagan, an atheist, but was a GOOD FATHER to his children and a very LOVING HUSBAND to his wife. There is no need for false stereotyping. If you allow religion to come between you and your daughter, then such conditional love must your god have instilled in you then. I would not take parenting advice from that god at all.


My friend's opinion: So you're a nurse, who takes care of people who are sick, and you also do babysitting means you're trusted by parents to look after their children, you are obviously someone who cares a great deal about people... and your Dad has a problem with you because you're an atheist??? There's plenty of friends with you in your pics, plenty of different places you've been to, plenty of hobbies and interests you have, you love life, and people, and new experiences.
He should be proud.


BACKGROUND:
I'm a 24-year-old Filipino nurse who's now working in another country. Whole family is back in Philippines and communicate with them through e-mail.

Raised as a Catholic and has always attended Catholic schools together with my siblings.

My dad just blocked me after this e-mail conversation and told me to cut communication with the entire family. Right now, I'm disappointed with my mom - who's always been a perfect christian wife - submissive in all ways (because this is what scripture commands women to be).

But the brighter side of everything is that I am lucky to be working and living independently and have come to the enlightenment which gave me a better appreciation in this one life that I have and I will not waste it away with some spiritual fantasy."	t5_2qh2p	True
