The rover went into safe mode last night after a problem validating a file. It's apparently not that concerning. It will mean more days before they can resume normal operations. The A side computer has been validated as a good backup, and if there's a problem with the B side during the solar conjunction (April 8-28) the rover will be able to autonomously switch over. They also installed some software patches that are designed to prevent the original problem. JPL will issue a statement on the safing event later today.

In the Q&amp;A Irene Klotz asked how long it might take to resolve the latest problem, and if science operations had resumed before the glitch. The answer was that science operations had not resumed, and without last night's glitch they probably would have started today. They expect a delay of two sols.

It has now been 18 days since the rover was last able to perform science operations, following the initial memory problem on the A side computer on Feb. 28. Since then, MSL engineers have been working on getting the B side spare computer up and running with all the latest patches and operational codes."	t5_2uov2	True

When they'd go out on the surface of mars, they'd wear a space suit, like what they wore on the moon (different, but similar). 

Now, the surface of Mars is pretty cold, but not like ""instant death"" cold. The atmosphere is thin and comprised mostly of CO2. And there's probably a decent amount of solar radiation hitting the surface. That said, wouldn't it be entirely survivable to take a deep breath in your astronaut house and run out onto the surface in jeans and a sweat shirt... and hell, let out a quick ""I'm on mars, bitches!"" and then run back in? 

It'd be cold as hell and you wouldn't be able to take a breath... eventually, it would cause cancer... and maybe your ears would pop really bad... but you could go out onto the martian surface au naturel for very brief stints, couldn't you?

Looking at that spot, if you switch to the [sol 63 photo for the same camera,](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00063/opgs/edr/fcam/FLA_403075179EDR_F0050104FHAZ00311M_.JPG) just above where the dead pixel was, a dark spot appears on the ground. It's the only thing that seems to have changed from day to day.

I thought it had something to do with the dead pixel, but if you look at the [Front Right Hazcam for sol 62,](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00062/opgs/edr/fcam/FRA_402986405EDR_F0050104FHAZ00311M_.JPG) and then to the [one from sol 63,](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/00063/opgs/edr/fcam/FRA_403075179EDR_F0050104FHAZ00311M_.JPG) the same dark spot appears.

(I have no explanation for why she has a swimsuit on over her PJs at 3pm, that's just how she rolls I guess.

**Context**

I wrote the following email to the White House the morning after Curiosity landed.

&gt; Dear President Obama,
&gt;
I just wanted to let you know how much Curiosity's successful landing on Mars means to me. The fact that ANY organization in the world could sent a 1-ton mobile research platform to Mars and land it safely, much less using a hovering, rocket-propelled sky crane, is a triumph of human intelligence, civilization and cooperation. The fact that it was our National Aeronautics and Space Administration makes me more proud to be an American than anything has in a long time. What truly inspires me about this mission, however, is not the flawless success the NASA scientists and engineers achieved last night, or the staggering technological advances that have been fueled by similar exploration. Rather, it is the unbridled joy and the unity I have seen on the faces of the crying, hugging members of Mission Control, in countless celebratory internet posts, and in excited conversation with people this morning. I am 20 years old, and the only times I can remember feeling as close to my fellow Americans as I do now have been during national tragedies. The unifying effect of scientific expeditions like the Curiosity and the Apollo landings is incredibly powerful, all the more so because it is born out of triumphant national success, rather than sorrow. Please, continue to fund NASA and its expeditions. In so many ways, we lift ourselves up when we shoot for the stars. 

&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;[My Name]

Two days ago I received this email from Jim Green:

&gt;[My Name]...
&gt;
I am Jim Green the Director of Planetary Science at NASA and the top advocate for planetary science in the Federal Government. Curiosity rover is one of the missions in my Division. Recently I had the very great pleasure of reading your letter (dated August 6th) to President Obama and I was very impressed with what you had to say. President Obama was very kind to let me see your message. 
&gt;
I would like your permission to read your letter out loud at a National Academy of Sciences meeting on Monday. The members are all planetary scientists, many of whom are directly involved in the Curiosity Rover but all who will greatly benefit from hearing what you have to say. The meeting is webcasted so some members of the public will also hear your words. 
&gt;
Please let me know as soon as you can. I will not read your letter without your permission. 
&gt;
Very Best Regards
&gt;
Jim Green 
&gt;
Director, Planetary Science Division
&gt;
NASA Headquarters

So I gave him my enthusiastic permission to read it. I'm so psyched!

* 1 byte = 8 bits
* kb = kilobits
* kB = kilobytes
* mb = megabits
* MB = megabytes

* Direct data transfer rate between **Curiosity and Earth**, 32kb/s = **4 kB/s**
* Data transfer rate between **Curiosity and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter**, 2mb/s = **256 kB/s**
* Data transfer rate between **Curiosity and Odyssey orbiter**, 256kb/s = **32 kB/s**

**Assumptions/limitations.**

* Assume the data transfer from the direct connection with the rover does not exceed the data transferred  by the orbiters (this is what I read)
* Curiosity can transfer data to the mars orbiters **8 minutes / day / each orbiter**
* Curiosity always has more data stored locally than can be transmitted, even when transmitting to an orbiter (Snapping a high def color picture once a day would more than guarantee this, let alone the important data)
* The Mars orbiters can transmit more data back to earth per day than they receive from Curiosity per day (I looked up the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter data transfer rate to earth and it's apparently 6mbits/s which is nuts and I don't believe it)

**Throughput:**
So with the orbiters and curiosity itself, we're looking at:
4 kB/s * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day = 345600 kB/day, or 337.5 MB/day, but this connection won't be operating at peak all the time, and I've read that most of the data will come from the orbiters.  Let's assume the max here is as much as can be transferred by the orbiters.

**Mars orbiters...**

* **Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter** gets 256 kB/s * 60 seconds/minute * 8 minutes/day = 1228800 kB/day, or **120 MB/day**

* **Odyssey orbiter** gets 32 kB/s * 60 seconds/minute * 8 minutes/day = 15360 kB/day, or **15 MB/day**

* That's 120 + 15 MB/day from the orbiters = 135 MB/day.  Based on my assumption above, we double that to **270 MB/day**

* 270 MB/day / 24 hours/day / 60 minutes/hour / 60 seconds/minute * 1024 kB/MB = **3.2 kB/s**

So, based on the information I can find, the max we're looking at is a throughput of 3.2 kB/s with a latency (roundtrip) of 1692000 miliseconds, to put it into units we're used to seeing regarding data transfer on the internet.

Is anyone willing to help me make the ultimate landing video when the final images of the sequence are released? All the criticisms were valid and I need some help to make it amazing.	stealthispost	70	9	12	"Namely:

- the color blobs in the middle - I've struggled to get the color levels right without desaturating totally.

- Properly white balanced to nasa's specs.

- properly frame interpolated (so excited about this)

- stabilized more smoothly

I can pm anyone interested with a link to the HD images separated out, cropped, scaled to 1600 x 1200, etc.

I've been getting a lot of crashes with the following frame interpolation softwares:
http://slowmovideo.granjow.net/faq.html
http://avisynth.org.ru/mvtools/mvtools2.html#download
Can anyone get these to work and help us try to get the video into 30fps and without much visible interpolation artifacts?

Also, if anyone has a copy of Adobe After Effects with the Twixtor plugin, I believe that this would be the ultimate interpolation option.

Too many artifacts at 4fps speed, I've found 10fps to be the sweet spot. 

Also, we need someone who can annotate the video with the exact stages of descent. 
I'm going to create a shared youtube account so that we can achieve this.

From launch to land I find the expedition of Curiosity to be absolutely astounding, I just can't believe that there are people out there smart enough to build something of this magnitude.  For me, it truly feels like science-fiction is happening in the present day.

Due to this I'd like to present a half-question, half-discussion topic that I've been thinking about lately, which is the effect Curiosity will have on a manned voyage to Mars.  Some guiding questions I've wondered consist of:

-If Curiosity finds indisputable evidence that life once existed on Mars, then can we expect a manned mission to Mars sooner?  Will evidence of life make any difference?

-If so, how much sooner will a mission be planned?  What year can we expect the first human to set foot on Mars?

-Let's just talk in theory; if Curiosity finds nothing groundbreaking or new, what does that mean for a manned mission to Mars?  Will it hinder the chances?

-How contingent are future NASA space missions on the success of Curiosity?  If it's a wild success, what can we expect to come out of NASA in the near future?  Will it make it a difference?

-Not even talking about finding *life*, but what if Curiosity finds something new in terms of mineral composition or historical data?  Will *that* have any effect on humans traveling to Mars?

These are a few questions that I've had on my mind.  I would love to discuss and hear what Reddit has to say regarding this subject.  So if you're at all interested, by all means, post away!"	t5_2uov2	True

1348951770.0	10ok2l	Notes and links on the visual detection of stromatolites as potential markers of ancient life on Mars.	lensman00	56	6	11	"TL;DR: Researchers believe that if Curiosity's landscape cameras spot fossil evidence of life it may be like very ancient earth forms such as [stromatolites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite). Stromatolites on Mars wouldn't be proof of life, but their discovery would make a strong case for future missions to the site.

&gt; Science team members for the new Mars rover Curiosity will use the rover’s powerful cameras to specifically look for visible evidence of past life on Mars, like the 3.5 billion year old fossilized microbe ""stromatolite"" colonies found on Earth.

&gt; ""There are a number of people on the team interested in this question"" of finding evidence for life with Curiosity, said John Grotzinger, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) project scientist, at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif.  ""It tends to come up quite a bit"" in the science team, Grotzinger said at a NASA briefing on MSL readiness.

http://www.americaspace.org/?p=21083

&gt; FLATOW: And how about something that might have to do with life or former life? I know you're an expert in stromatolites, which are sort of globs of sandy rock formed and held together by films of bacteria in shallow water. And you've also talked about the fact that there may not have to be life forms that form these things.

&gt; But I imagine you must be very excited by the fact that maybe these kinds of things might be nearby, and you might find something like that?

&gt; GROTZINGER: Yeah, I think that the - you know, of course we're holding our breaths in advance of approaching the first outcrops to imagine what might be there. And the one thing about Curiosity is that it was designed really not to do life detection; that's really a very separate mission concept. You know, Viking attempted to do that, and we have no way to detect microbial respiration, we have no way to look for micro-fossils.

&gt; If something like a stromatolite popped up, you know, that would be a thrilling discovery, but short of that, what we're really doing is sort of addressing the intermediate step of trying to find what we would call a habitable environment, a place that has water. All life as we know it need water. Energy. All microorganisms require a source of energy for metabolism. And a source of carbon, because all life as we know it is based structurally on carbon.

http://www.npr.org/2012/08/10/158572705/after-terror-mars-scientists-plan-exploration

&gt; ""One of my motivations for understanding stromatolites is the knowledge that if microbial communities once flourished on Mars, of all the traces they might leave in the rock record for us to discover, stromatolite and microbial reefs are arguably the most easily preserved and readily detected."" - JPL astrobiologist Abigail Allwood

http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090716141221.htm

&gt; If a rover stumbled across a stromalite-looking mound on the surface of Mars, scientists would doubtless get very excited. But that discovery would not in itself be definitive evidence of past or present Martian life, since similar mounds can also form without the assistance of living organisms.

http://www.space.com/13911-mars-life-search-magnetic-signatures.html

Questionable Life: Finding evidence of ancient life on Mars may be even more difficult than we thought.

&gt; investigators cannot substitute just any stromatolite for fossil evidence in the search for ancient life, whether on Earth or Mars. Stromatolites alone can never be used as definitive evidence for the presence of life, says Grotzinger, simply because their geometric aspects are going to be identical to things that can be produced abiologically.

http://discovermagazine.com/1997/feb/questionablelife1067

Perhaps one of us will spot the first stromatolite found on another planet! Here's a Mars Stromatolite ID site (includes photos of potential earth analogues and a suggested typology):

http://www.evolutionaryresearch.org/stromatolites.htm

Finally, a 2005 NASA educational film ""Stromatolite Explorer"" explains some of the biology and chemistry of stromatolite formation and talks briefly about their place in the search for life on other planets. It's a quicktime movie.

Planets are first formed by swirling gas (and other matter) with enough time eventually forms into a planet orbiting a star and by the pure randomness of the process, all the planets in the universe must all have their own particular gravity depending on the mass (or size?),

If you fall over on earth you can hurt yourself because of the because of gravity's pull you would hit the floor.

Why didn't they just make a simple aluminum or tough plastic cover, or put the wiring inside the main structure?

1346185863.0	yzax3	Thinking About the Lack of Life on Mars	benpatient	93	51	109	"These beautiful Curiosity photos have affected me in ways that I was not expecting. I have always thought about Mars one of two ways: 

1: A comic-book/movie prop full of green-headed hairless monsters. 

2: A far-off fuzzy rock with probably some water on it, and a bunch of dust, and maybe, just possibly, some evidence that there was life there at some point in the past.

Now I am being forced to come to terms with the landscape. It's just little sharp rocks on a rugged, rolling, tortured landscape. Those rocks sit there for tens of thousands of years with nothing but temperature changes and wind pushing on them. It looks cold. It looks so forlorn and desolate. I started to think about what it would be like to actually *be* there, and even though it should be an exciting prospect, and something I always thought I would love to do (sacrifice my own return home for the opportunity to go to another planet), now I can't shake the feeling that it would be like the saddest, most brutal and unforgiving nightmare anyone could imagine. 

In horror space films, there is some kind of bad guy, some nemesis. Curiosity's photos have me thinking that the nemesis would be your own mind. How could a thinking, loving, caring human being survive in a place where there wasn't anything to keep them company...not even microbes chewing on the surfaces of rocks.

I think that life on Mars would have already been evident if it were there. Even just something similar to a slime mold would have, without any competition, covered huge swaths of the planet. We have gone to Mars. I thought I would be excited for the possibilities that open up with this unparalleled mission. Instead I find myself staring at those scattered fist-sized chunks of jagged rock, completely baren of anything alive. There is nothing there. 

Even if we aren't alone in the universe, I think we will know soon that we are alone in our solar system, and that means that unless we are visited, we are alone for my lifetime. The scales are too vast. 

Mars is dead, and it always has been. What on earth are we going to do now?"	t5_2uov2	True

Using the [JPL HORIZONS](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi) ephemerides for Mars and ISON, they'll be closest at about 14:00 UT on 1 Oct 2013. We can extract the Earth-Mars distance (2.13351 AU), the Earth-ISON distance (2.13317 AU), and the ISON apparent visual magnitude as seen from Earth (10.96; though note that the [IAU Minor Planet Center](http://scully.cfa.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/returnprepeph.cgi?d=c&amp;o=CK12S010) predicts it to be about half a mag brighter). The Mars-ISON distance is then ~0.038 AU.

We can calculate the magnitude as viewed from Mars:  
m = -5*log(2.13351/0.038) + 10.96  
m = 2.21 (or m~1.7 if the MPC magnitude is correct)

So will the positions work out such that ISON is above the horizon for Curiosity within a few hours of this time? I think so. Sunset for the rover will be at [about UTC 15:00 on Oct 1](http://curiosityrover.com/sundata/), and [these orbital diagrams](http://imgur.com/a/rt0p8) from heavens-above.com indicate that ISON will be crossing the meridian just after sunset. Given that the comet is above the ecliptic and the rover is near the Martian equator, I'd guess that it will be in the northern sky.

However, I'm not too familiar with Curiosity's instruments, so my question to you Curiosity Georges is this: will it be able to snap a photo? What sort of sky-pointing camera capabilities does it have? The scientific value of such a photo would be minimal, but it would be a really fun APOD-type image (and a good PR photo for the mission).

1363941716.0	1asg55	MSL Curiosity wind sensor - damage may have been caused by tether-release pyrotechnics, not flying grit	Graham6789	35	2	8	"NASA reported on 21 August 2012 that damage to Curiosity rover's wind sensor may have been caused by surface stones thrown up during landing, breaking sensor circuits and wiring. 

However, an alternative explanation is that a pressure wave, caused by the pyrotechnic release of Skycrane's three tethers immediately following touch-down, damaged the wind sensor. 

Two short finger-like booms carry the REMS weather station on Curiosity's Mastcam. 

Boom 1, which sticks out sideways on Mastcam, was located precariously during landing. While Mastcam was lying flat on Curiosity's deck, undeployed, the boom was situated extremely closely - within inches - to the starboard tether release point. This can be seen clearly in pre-launch photographs. 

The pyrotechnic charge that released the tether may have caused an air pressure wave that was sufficiently strong to damage Boom 1's instrumentation, even in Mars's thin atmosphere. Boom 2, facing the opposite direction at the time of release, was undamaged and it continues to work properly. 

If this new theory is correct, it means that Curiosity inflicted injury on itself during its dramatic rocket-powered landing sequence. 

Mechanical damage caused by falling debris may not have occurred at all. Photographs of Curiosity's upper deck after landing show a light scattering of pebbles and dust over its surface, kicked up by the Skycrane's rocket engines. It was certainly not the hail of rocks as described in many news reports. "	t5_2uov2	True

It looks like the sample analysis is going to start a few Sols later than expected. Here are the details:

&gt; Here is the latest update from NASA on the timing of instrument testing on the Curiosity rover:

&gt; MSL had some logistics issues associated with the transition from one version of software to another.  These issues have been overcome, but they had to postpone some instrument commissioning activities.  The SAM timeline below reflects the current plan for completing SAM Commissioning activities.  MSL seems to be a little more gun-shy so events below could get further delayed.

&gt; Aug 20:  Sol-14 Sample Manipulation System commissioning will run the full range of motion (rotational, and elevation) on the cup carousel.

&gt; Aug 22:  Sol-16 will be our checkout of the full instrument functionality, including the Quadrapole Mass Spectrometer, the Gas Chromatograph, the Tuneable Laser Spectrometer, and Wide Range Pumps – with an added bonus of the first science spectra attained from an Atmospheric sample.

""
A search for Methane was made on multiple nightime runs but so far we have *no definitive detection of methane*. 

We see differences between the full cell and empty cell results of *a part per billion or so* but the data uncertainty is larger than this and could accomodate values from *no methane at all up to 4 or 5 parts per billion at the 95% confidence limits*.
""


.

**So they found 1ppb of methane which could mean none or 5ppb**


.

[Gale Crater is located in a low methane area](http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1009/21mars/) where below 5ppb CH4 is expected in the Martian summer.

It is currently [Winter on Mars](http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/mars/mars-calendar.html)

According to the [2009 paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5917/1041.full) the methane could be Volcanic or Ancient or Life.

On page 7 &amp; 8 the methane sinks are discussed: peroxides, perchlorates enhanced by electrical dust devils.

It concludes by proposing a possible deep extremophile biome 2-3Km down.

That's a long time!

Edit: thanks for trying to answer my question, but i'm still finding it hard to believe that these things are 3Billion years old. That's a ridiculous amount of time, whole mountain ranges come and go in that time, here on earth!

So the cool laser thingy will soon fire at a rock. There is lots of [information](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/spectrometers/chemcam/) available, with lots of complicated [science](http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/Instruments/ChemCam/). ChemCam has its own web page [here](http://www.msl-chemcam.com/) with its own blog and some videos (partially in French).

This [video](http://www.msl-chemcam.com/index.php?menu=videos&amp;rubrique=62&amp;sousrubrique=215&amp;contact_page=videos&amp;video=244&amp;autoplay=1&amp;titre_url=All%20about%20ChemCam%20-%20Just%20for%20fun%E2%80%A6) takes a kinda goofy dumbed down approach to explain what the thing does. But even after watching this I guess that average Joe still has no idea what a spectrometer is.

So I'll present my version of a dumbed down (but too long) explanation here, as far as I understand this thing. Maybe others can clarify my misinterpretations or can come up with better analogies for non-science people.

First of all, ChemCam consists of two major parts. One of them is a camera. This camera is attached to a telescope, so it's like a consumer camera stuck at maximum zoom. It can take close-up pictures of stuff that is several meters away. The pictures are black-and-white with a resolution of one megapixel.

The black-and-white camera cannot distinguish between colors, but it has the advantage that it can see light which a color camera cannot see. It can see ultraviolet (""black light"") and infrared light. It can also see better in the dark. So it can look at rocks in a different way than the other scientific cameras can. It always looks exactly at the spot where the laser hits the rock, so it also acts as a ""laser rifle scope"", to aim the laser at the correct spot and to examine the hole afterwards.

There is another camera on Curiosity which is also supposed to look at rocks up close (""hand lens imager""). As the name says, this camera is more like a hand lens, microscope, or the macro mode of a consumer camera. This camera is mounted at the robotic arm and has to get real close to the rock to take a close-up picture. The ChemCam can take detailed pictures from far away, because of its telescope.

The second part of ChemCam is the laser thing. The laser beam is not visible. It is concentrated on a rock and makes a very small part of that rock kinda explode. The laser is activated only for a very short time: 200000000 (yes, eight zeroes) pulses would fit in one second. It is so powerful that a tiny part of the rock not just melts or turns into some vapor. It gets so hot that even its molecules fall apart. All we can see from this is a small spark where the laser hit the rock and a hole afterwards (action can be seen in some of the videos).

The spark is what ChemCam looks at, also through the telescope. Its colors give information about the atoms inside the spark. What does that mean?

If you look at fireworks, they can explode in all kinds of colors. If you don't know anything about pyrotechnic composition, you just say ""cool, that exploded in blue"". Someone who has knowledge about pyrotechnic can say ""cool, that exploded in blue, so there was some amount of the element Copper inside the stuff that just exploded"". Because Copper is used to make fireworks blue.

Don't take this analogy too far, but this is kind of what the ChemCam does. Various chemical elements ""explode"" in different colors when hit by the laser. So by closely looking at the colors of the spark at the rock it can tell which elements are in there.

Now all the information sites say that there is a thing called ""spectrometer"" which ""analyzes the light"". Actually, there are three spectrometers in the ChemCam, but for sake of simplicity we can assume that this is one big spectrometer. Why don't they just use a color camera instead of this spectrometer thingy? A color camera can distinguish between lots of colors. You may have read about the magic number of 16.7 million different colors somewhere. Isn't this enough?

Well, it isn't. A color camera is built to simulate a human eye. Human eyes as well as color cameras have color sensors for red, green and blue only. So basically they are pretty crappy spectrometers. But when I look around I can see stuff in all kinds of colors: yellow, white, pink, whatever. So how does this relate to only receiving red, green and blue in the eye?

Let's make an experiment (a thought experiment, don't try this at home). You put both hands on a table, at some distance from each other. Your left hand is now the eye sensor for ""green"", your right hand senses ""red"". To keep it simple (and you have only two hands) we ignore ""blue"". Now I take your mom's iron as a imitation of a light source, heat it up and press it against the underside of the table. Can you tell me approximately where I put it?

Probably yes. If your left hand gets pretty warm but your right hand doesn't, the iron is below your left hand. For the eye this would mean that there is a signal from ""green"", but none from ""red"", so the color you see is green. No surprise here.

If we do the same thing below your right hand, only that will get warm, this indicates ""red"".

Now I move the iron again and you feel both hands getting equally warm. So where did I put it? Obviously below the space *between* your hands. The table spreads the heat to all sides, so your hands can feel it even if the heat source is not directly below your hand. For the eye this means that there is light coming in which is not red and not green, but in the middle. Red and green sensors get a signal and the brain does the same what you do when you try to locate the heat source: it says that the color is in the middle between red and green, which you see as yellow.

If your left hand gets colder and the right hand gets warmer you can assume that I moved the iron towards your right hand. The eye interprets ""some amount of green but more red"" as orange.

This is how you can see all the different colors with just three different sensors. Every mix of intensity is seen as a different color.

Now I take two irons and glue them to the underside of the table, just below your hands. If I switch on the iron below your right hand, there is no difference to the experiment we had before. You feel the heat source below your right hand. There are also no surprises if I switch on the iron below your left hand instead.

Now both irons are switched on. You feel both hands getting equally warm. So the heat source must be in the middle? No, this time there is nothing in the middle. You just can't tell the difference. Your eyes can't tell the difference either. If the red and green sensors receive the same amount of light, it is seen as yellow. But in this case there is no yellow light coming in, it's really just red and green.

So we have to accept that there is ""real"" yellow and there is ""fake"" yellow and it looks the same. When do we see ""real"" yellow? When you happen to see yellow as a part of a rainbow outside. But when you take a picture of the rainbow and look at this picture on your computer screen, the yellow part of the rainbow is only a ""fake"" yellow. The camera turned the ""real"" yellow in a combination of red and green.

As humans we don't have to worry about that, but for the ChemCam this is not acceptable. It must know if there is ""real"" yellow or just red and green light coming from that rock because that makes a huge difference. Yellow could mean that some single element is part of that rock, but red and green might indicate that there are two completely different elements in that rock.

So eyes and normal cameras suck at analyzing colors. What does a real spectrometer do?

You need more sensors. And every sensor must be able to sense only a certain color and nothing else. For example a sensor for ""red"" must not receive anything when yellow light comes in. For our experiment that means that we must change things in a way that your hand can only feel the heat of the iron when it is directly below it.

Let's put the table away and use some thin material instead, maybe some fabric. It doesn't spread heat to the side as the table did. Instead of your hands you put your fingers on it because you have more of them and they are smaller. Put them all next to each other in a row. This isn't enough, so a few more people are needed who also put their fingers down. Maybe 40 fingers are enough. Now instead of a single hand there are several fingers responsible for receiving all variants of red light (the first ten). And there are also several for all kinds of orange (11 to 20), yellow (21 to 30), and green (31-40). When I put the iron somewhere below the fabric, you can tell me exactly where it is (ouch!). If fingers number 22 to 28 start to burn we know that these fingers are responsible for yellow and yellow only. None of the fingers assigned to red or green feel anything. This is ""real"" yellow"". You can tell the difference between one and several irons below the fabric. This is what a spectrometer can do.

&gt;This animation of NASA's Curiosity rover shows the complicated suite of operations involved in conducting the rover's first rock sample drilling on Mars and transferring the sample to the rover's scoop for inspection. The drilling and sample transfer took place on Feb. 8 and 20, 2013, or sols 182 and 193, Curiosity's 182nd and 193rd Martian days of operations.

&gt;The animation begins with Curiosity using its rotary percussive drill on a Martian rock. After drilling, the percussion mechanism is used to swish the sample around in the internal chambers of the drill bit to clean the bit and then transfer the sample to the scoop. The black halo around the drill illustrates when the drill's percussion mechanism is active, either hammering into rock or shaking the drill bit to help move the sample. An orange halo highlights use of the vibration mechanism that is part of the Collection and Handling for In-Situ Martian Rock Analysis (CHIMRA) subsystem. CHIMRA's vibration mechanism is also used to move the sample to the scoop before the scoop is imaged to verify that sample was collected.

&gt;The animation has been sped up 25 times compared to real time. The actions shown here were actually executed on two different sols so that engineers could check segments of the process.

&gt;The next steps, not shown in the animation, involve the rover processing the powdered rock and delivering it down the inlets for the Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument and the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument.

Anyone willing to help?	kesekia	19	3	10	"The idea is that a lot of us have had a go at making video sequences from the MARDI images. It occurred to me that we probably could coordinate efforts to work on different aspects of the video, such as Jpeg artifacts, contrast equalization, video stabilization and as proposed by stealthispost, slowmo frame interpolation.

So, here's the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/kesekia/wiki/MardiSequence), explaining what I've been up to. And here's the [code repository](https://code.google.com/p/kesekia/source/browse/). It's mostly python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PIL, pywin32) and avisynth.

In the wiki, I linked 4 zip files of the JPEG enhanced images (saved as PNG). I'll try and post some images of before / after when I find some time. Careful, these are big (450MB each average)

There's also a link to an avisynth script to read the images and turn them into a video sequence with its contrast enhanced. Avisynth scripts can be loaded in virtualdub. Video stabilization can be done with a [virtualdub plugin](http://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm) with nice results considering lens distortion.

Assuming no catastrophic failures and that you get mission extensions through end-of-life, how long are you expected to survive? I know your mission length is 700+ Sols, but as Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity all taught us, JPL builds you guys to last! Of course, you're powered by a radioactive thermogenerator, not some dusty old solar panels, so assuming no craziness, your maximum lifespan should be known already. Also, I know you charge your battery at night, so does that have a maximum known lifespan? If the battery were to stop holding a charge, would that be a mission ending situation, or would you just tire out more easily?

So Curiosity, how long can we poor landlubbers expect to look up at the sky in wonder, knowing that our ambassador is up there, alert and awake?

Thanks,

From reading, it seems the hatch is for installing the MMRTG (the hot nuclear thing that generates electricity) just before launch. This (late install) is because the MMRTG would heat up the rover too much on earth.

Pardon me if this has been discussed elsewhere, but I'd be curious of other peoples thoughts or knowledge. Mine is little.
