It's awesome. Sewiously) and the introduction for Wil Wheaton and the official start of the show was done by none other than Strong Bad, with a couple interruptions by Homestar Runner. There was no new animation. The voice was only over still images, but it was still Matt Chapman and it was AMAZING! Someone will have video up soon if they don't yet.

I have created an channel with the sole goal of archiving every single animation available on Homestarrunner.com. There are a few reasons for doing this: First and foremost, with HomeStar runner having been on hiatus for the past few years, who is to say how much longer The Brother Chaps will continue paying for Web Hosting and domain names. Secondly, It will provide publicity for H*R.com! Thirdly and finally, YouTube is just easier to watch on some devices than a Flash file is. 

If you'd like to help let me know in the comments, you need to have a method of converting the cartoons to video in good quality. Doing it alone would take ages, which Is why I'm asking for your help!

1361512719.0	1909nf	Matt Deleted His Twitter	Papasmurph1	81	11	27	"Look up ""Matt Chapman"" on Twitter, it never shows up.

It also says so on the HR wiki: http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Hiatuses

The statements below are my personal opinion of what's happening, not actual fact, but what is most likely happening in my mind.

""Who cares?"" You might ask. Matt's Twitter page being gone doesn't say anything about Homestarrunner, right? 

Well, as you all know, the last update to the site itself was over two years ago, the Decemberween toon. The last overall update was to the twitter page being the ""when you least expect it"" update. 

I have three theories to why Matt deleted his Twitter this January. Here they are in order from the least plausible to most plausible (in my opinion): 

1. Matt didn't like/need Twitter, so he deleted it. He has an e-mail for communicating with fans, after all.

2. Matt temporarily ""deactivated"" his Twitter because he was constantly being annoyed by fans after the ""when you least expect it"" update getting messages like ""HUR DUR WENZ DA NEW STRONG BAD MAKE NAO PLZ."" This theory implies he will reactivate his Twitter once the updates from the update blow over.

3. He deleted it not because of the fans, but because of the update itself. 

Let me explain. 

The Twitter said that he currently was dealing with family issues and a new child. It also said he was working for the Nickelodeon show ""Yo Gabba Gabba."" It also promised an update to content on his website. Here's what I think this all says.

Matt is settling in with his family and now has a steady job. This job was promising, and probably payed better than Homestarrunner. In his older job, he made money for people buying goods off of his website. True, people still buy his goods, but it's no secret that Homestarrunner's viewership has gone significantly even before the current Hiatus. There have been previous hiatuses, but this is by far the longest of them all. 

Actually, if all of the above is correct, that last statement is a lie. This isn't another hiatus, but the end of the road. 

Matt deleted the Twitter because it contained a promise for content that the fans were bugging him for. This content will never come because of his current steady job that he needs to support his family. Matt might really care about his fans and want to continue with the shorts, but he can't either way because of family, money, his job, and time he and Mike need to make the toons. Whenever people say there's never going to be another Homestarrunner toon, opposers would point to this picture as a symbol of hope for the website. Matt deleting it shows there is no hope for the future for the website, and just is as they left it.

Anyone who disagrees with me can go ahead, but just stop and think about this from Matt's perspective. I want the brothers Chap to start making toons again as much as the next guy, but I don't think it will ever be updated again due to the above reasons.

So let's stop wasting time hoping for a new toon, and treasure the site that is currently in front of us. Treasure not just the site itself, but memories of using it, and laughs we had being with Homestar and the rest of the wacky gang."	t5_2rj30	True

1347929929.0	101y1c	What is the Value of Tenerence Love?	Proper_Bert	71	7	5	"Hey, r/homestarrunner! Just listened to Coach Z's Rap Song and thought of something. If we consider the quote ""My name is Tenerence Love (TL), plus my name is TL, divided by my name is TL equals my name is TL, remainder three,"" then we can find the value of Tenerence Love! And who wouldn't want to know the exact numerical value of the greatest R&amp;B artist Free Country, USA has ever known?! 

So here are my calculations. Let me know if I screwed anything up.
Let x = Tenerence Love.

Given: (x+x)/x = x + (3/x)

Solve for x:

    x + x  = x^2 + 3
    2x     = x^2 +3
    0      = x^2 - 2x + 3
    x      = 1 (+\-) i*sqrt(2)

We can conclude from this that Tenerence Love is imaginary."	t5_2rj30	True

They already know how to sell shirts and I'm sure they could put together som really good content to sell.

**RERUNS** - http://www.livestream.com/oshplaysgaiden

Hey, I'm Oshtoby. I do a Homestar on Chatroulette Live show every now and again. I'm told my impression is spot on. I have a digital puppet for Homestar that I use, combined with my voice, to actually be Homestar on Chatroulette. I am going to do one Tomorrow, March 27th at 10 PM EST. I'd love for you to be there. It's always a big night of fun. I talk to the audience and all as I talk to the people on ChatRoulette. Take suggestions on what to say. And all that, and all that.

The wedding is a pop-culture/geek culture theme located on a large tall-ship. (Pirate ship!)  

She'd like to dress up Trogdor for the occasion by adding perhaps some pirate accessories like Jack's hat, boots, etc...  or a top hat &amp; bow tie?  

However, we suck as original artists and need some help!  I can recreate something with sharpies overtop the tattoo if I have a picture in front of me to go by.  Is anyone here a decent artist and could perhaps add to Trogdor and post the image?  Even something Homestar related like Trogdor is dragging a defeated pirate Homestar or Strongbad..?

Thanks in advance if anyone is up to the challenge.  The more HomestarRunner references that can be worked into it, the better.  So even if you can't draw, do you have any suggestions?

Then, a few years back, I got a dog.  As dogs do sometimes, he mauled that hat (and several others I had).  I was heartbroken.  

Recently, however, I was given a vintage [Strong Bad Hoodie](http://www.hrwiki.org/w/images/thumb/c/c2/Strong_Bad_hoodie.PNG/150px-Strong_Bad_hoodie.PNG), size XL.  I'm a bit bigger than XL, though, so it didn't fit.

So many great shows get cut off in what seems to be their prime, while other shows go on waaaaay too long.  In my opinion, HSR peaked in the couple years before they stopped doing weekly updates.  The toons that followed (like the whale drive-thru thing and the committee of hat people or whatever) were pretty weak.  I think it has tremendous rewatch value, and I'd rather watch classics ten times than a weak new toon.  Am I the only one who's maybe not so sad that it's (pretty much) over?  Don't get me wrong, I love HSR, but I really would have hated to see it go the way of the Simpsons, where all the characters are just half-assed caricatures of themselves.  Did anyone else think they were in decline, or could the HSR universe stay fresh for years to come?  Thoughts?
