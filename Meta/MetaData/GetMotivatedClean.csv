As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the ""half empty or half full"" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired: ""How heavy is this glass of water?""
Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz.
She replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes."" She continued, ""The stresses and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed – incapable of doing anything.""
It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses. As early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don't carry them through the evening and into the night. Remember to put the glass down!"	t5_2rmfx	True

I give him my license and he looks at me and he says ""Sir, false identification is a penalty under law."" Before I could compute what he said he asks if i'm a citizen, and at that point I realized that he thought my license was fake.  I had to convince him that the picture in my ID was in fact me.  I told him how I had lost 40 pounds over the past year and a half and how much my body has changed.  I showed him my student ID and he held it up next to my license and he could finally tell the resemblance.  He couldn't believe that I had in essence become a different person.  We started talking about working out, sports, and college. A few minutes later he gave me written warning and encouraged me to keep up the good work.  I never really thought about how far I have come since I decided to transform my body.  Even though i'm not where I want to be, tonight just proved i'm sure as hell on the right track.

1352914700.0	136ux1	5am-ers	lmburr	1611	251	133	"I had a thought last night that I might share with you, wolves. You see, about a month ago, I was swimming twice every day (700 yards, not much for a real swimmer, but for 5'11"", ~240lbs it wasn't nothing) and things were good: my confidence was higher than ever, I felt great physically, I found myself able to focus on things for greater lengths of time, and I went to sleep exhausted every night (which is a sensation that I value highly). I woke up every morning at five to swim, because that was when the pool opened, so I was basically guaranteed a lane, and then I swam again when I was done with classes in the afternoon.

Then I got sick; not seriously, it was a pretty standard cold, but it made me miserable and I couldn't bring myself to swim for a week. That led to the habit of simply not going swimming, morning or afternoon that lasted about three weeks.

Last night I was trying to convince myself to set my alarm clock to 5am and I had a thought: ""I'm not a very good swimmer, what's the point of waking up that early just so people can make fun of how bad I am?""

Then I had another thought: ""No one wakes up at 5am to watch someone fail."" People are either asleep or they aren't at 5am, and the ones who are awake are too focused on what they woke up at 5am for to think about someone else's failures.

I woke up at 5am this morning. I am going to wake up at 5am tomorrow."	t5_2rmfx	True

1342369001.0	wlhzu	A way I have recently changed my thinking that has helped me.	DEATHBYMAGUA	1492	298	97	"I was listening to [this](http://soundcloud.com/resonance-fm/sets/24-hour-zizek/) lecture by psychoanalyst and philosopher Slavoj Zizek and something he talked about really hit me hard. 

The first example he gave was if you ask an adolescent boy about his father you will often get something about how stupid the father is in what a pretty typical adolescent rebelliousness. But when you observe that child around his father, you see a completely different story, one where the child shows some combination of respect, fear and love for his father. So which is the lie, the world in which that boy lives or the world in the boy's head?

Zizek uses many more examples, but one more that resonated with me was the idea of soldiers at war. A more vulgar example, a jew killing Nazi may have been torn apart by the acts he was committing and barely able to live with himself. But does that in any way change the monster he is? 

The idea here is that who we are is rooted in our actions. The story in our head, the world around us and everything else are abstractions of this most fundamental realm of existence. 

I can't tell you how many times I've found some excuse not to work out today, or not to study or not to give something my all and still retained the idea that I do give things my all, just not today. If I really wanted to I could though. 

The fact is, however, that the one time I don't work out - I sacrifice that part of myself that won't let anything get in my way. If I sleep until noon, it isn't a one time thing, or extenuating circumstances - I am now a person that will sleep until noon. 

I am not some person that lives in my head. I am what I do. And every time I fail to act, I become that failure to act - no matter what lie I want to tell myself in my head. 

Have you sat on reddit for a few hours today doing nothing? If yes, then you can make up any story you want in your head about how it is raining outside or you need a relaxing day, but the fact of the matter is that you are person who spent hours on reddit today, period. There is no story or context, just the fact of your actions - that is who you are.

Every since I've realized this I lost the crippling narrative of, ""All I have to do is x and then I will be okay"" - NO! If I do x I am x, if I don't do x then I am not x. That's it. It's not like I get to sit on the sideline and pretend I'm not living an actual life until I actually get something done - my actions are who I am. 

Since I have realized this, I no longer tell myself that I have to do x,y, and z tomorrow to be something. I am x, y, and z. If I want to be rich I don't have to get organized, or become organized - I must be organized. And that isn't something that I just choose to do one day as a chore, it's not some switch that I turn on when I really need it - it's something that I do or don't do through my actions, every day. And if one day I decide to be lazy or procrastinate, then that's part of who I am, I'm a person who is sometimes lazy and procrastinates. So I either act otherwise, or become that.

Sorry if this too steam of consciousness or doesn't make any sense - but it has helped me a lot over the past week and figured I ought to share. "	t5_2rmfx	True

There is a gravel road that leads all the way up it that hikers use to get to the top. It is just under 1000 ft  climb, and a brutal 1.8 mile climb to the top on foot, let alone bike. After my first try I made it a quarter of the way before backing out. Today I said was the day. And I made it. I made it all the way to the top! I feel so great about myself I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs when I reached the top and conqured the hill. The pain was grueling but I didnt give up, I stopped to eat a breakfast bar, take a swig of water and powered through.

1351784418.0	12gmji	How I went from lazy student to a success. Tips, Tricks, and strategies inside. Willing to answer questions as well.	Self-Discipline	1436	309	117	"A little background about myself:

I used to be the one of the laziest kids around in High School. I didn't find High School particularly challenging, so I never needed to put forth the effort to study to get A's and B's. Head into college my lazy ways continued, and well as many of you know that doesn't usually have a good ending. Fortunately for me I told myself now is the time to change my life around. Fast Forward to now I am nearing graduation and will be graduating among the top of my class in Accounting. Not an engineering or mathematics degree, but still something I can hold my head high about. I give to you Reddit some tips to be successful and stay motivated.


1. Finding Motivation - It doesn't matter if you know all the correct ways and strategies to study if you do not have motivation. I don't care what your motivation is, but you need to find something that that gets you fired up. For me it was beating that smart-ass kid in class, people telling me that I was lazy, people telling me I was never going to be successful. Wherever you find you your motivation never forget and always reminding yourself of it. 


2. Proper Learning Habits - I give you an example of two kids that I know. One kid that I knew in college was always spending ungodly amount of hours studying. Hours upon hours of studying, yet he never did that well in class. He managed to squeak out with B's and C's. Another kid I knew studied hard, but never put in un godly number of hours studying and had a high gpa and always tested well.. The difference between the two kids, and they were similar when it came to smarts, is the way they went about learning. One kid sat there and just memorized and memorized and memorized. I would see him just staring at his notes reading over and over. The other kid I knew always had his book out, notes out, and was always writing things down. One kid was memorizing while the kid was learning. You need to be able to teach the material to someone else not just spit out random facts. 



4. Study Strategies -  Now that you know its about learning here are some strategies I have. What worked best for me when learning material was taking it slow and trying to nail down a topic before I moved onto another topic. You need to be active when study. I would rather spend and hour trying hard and studying then wasting five hours of my time memorizing. You need to test yourself write out questions and then answers. Go over your notes and be able to lecture them to somebody or the wall. For technical based classes you just need to practice problems there are thousands of problems you can find online for numerous classes. I want to add sometimes you can get a different perspective on things googling your topic and watching YouTube videos. 


5.  Time Management - You know time management is crucial, so use your time wisely. I went through periods in college and still do where I will have a ton of work and not so much. If you are constantly doing work to stay ahead you never quite feel so overwhelmed. One example is when a teacher tells you you have an exam coming up in a week. Why are you waiting until the last night night studying 6 hours when they had 7 days where they could put in an hour a day of studying and have more time for other stuff an less stress. Don't do it!

Edit*

6. Embrace the Suck - One thing I always hear from people when they are giving out advice is that you have to try and find enjoyment in what you are doing. I am sorry, but for myself I can't always find enjoyment in something like tax accounting or whatever it may be. Sometimes you just have to make embrace the fact that cracking open the books isn't going to be fun, but it will be worth the while in the end. Although it does help to try and study something that you are passionate about sometimes you have to bite the bullet and realize the cracking open the books will be beneficial in the end. 

7. Get a shitty Job - Now this one is more geared towards students rather than people who have graduated and gotten a degree, but some principles still apply. One of the things that really motivated me when I was starting to do poorly was my job. I had a job that was basic grunt work for a construction company. Not the worst job in the world, but something I did not want to find myself doing for the rest of my life. Having a shitty job like this gave me motivation to do well in school, so I could get a good paying job and do something that I enjoy. It also forced me to schedule my time better. I didn't always have a ton free times between work and school, so I didn't get distracted with other useless tasks. 

8. Self - Improvement - One of the best things here about /r/getmotivated is that sometimes we create a chain reaction when start picking up good habits. There are simple things you can do which will build your self-confidence, and help you in other aspects of life. There are many things that will help you feel more confident. I think one of the best things is exercise and you see visbible improvements. I never even stepped foot in a gym just did a lot of body-weight type exercises. You have no excuse if you want to get fit. Improving other areas in your life will help you GET MOTIVATED to do other things. 


tl;dr: Get pissed off and motivated, try to learn rather than memorize, schedule wisely, it's going to suck, get a shitty job, always improve yourself.

Loved to hear your questions guys thanks for the feedback, so far. Always remember the hardest part to changing yourself is the starting. 


I'll be back for more if you guys are interested just wanted to help some people out at reddit. Love to answer some questions if have some.

Wow, guys can't believe this has hit the front page truly remarkable. I have loved hearing all the success stories and those that are on the road to success.

I don't know where you come from, where you're going, or why you do what you do. I don't know if we'd get along if we met. But there is one thing that I do know: You are capable of much more than you have been led to believe.

As I am writing this, there are 6.7 billion people walking and breathing on our humble rock. The overwhelming, vast majority of them will pas through their 720,000 hours like a match struck in the wind. Hardly noticed, scarcely remembered.

Tomorrow, as you go about your day, take you time to look around. Are there a lot of people around? What do you see? You see mediocrity. You see average. You see everything about yourself that you hate, that you fear, but that you have been conditioned to believe is acceptable. Fine. Enough. A good job.

I'm here to tell you that you will NOT settle for what is fine. You will NOT settle for a good job. Fine is for the loser. Fine is for the guy who skipped the last set of his workout because he just didn't feel like it. Fine is for the guy who cheated on his diet (this goes for you too, you skinny fuck) because he just couldn't do it anymore. Fine is for the guy who took a nap instead of sprinting around town in a torrential downpour. Fine is for the guy who got the job, but not the one he wanted. That guy made second place. He has never embraced pain, personal sacrifice, or thrown himself into the fires of dedication. Most importantly, and starting today, this guy is NOT YOU.

You are not this person. You are destined for greatness. You have it inside of you, and you know it. You have always known it, you have felt it as a faint thumping in your gut. It is clawing, scratching, struggling to be set free. It needs your help. As long as you hold yourself to the standard of ""average,"" that is all you will ever be. In your dreams you aren't average, so why the FUCK are you settling for it now? What are you not doing right now, anon? What is eating at the back of your skull? Go do IT. You know what it is, soldier. The time to act is now. You will burn. You will suffer. Your demons will not be defeated easily. Every step of the way they will whisper in your ear that you aren't good enough. That you aren't meant to succeed. ""Just give up,"" they will mutter, ""you'll never be the best."" ""NO,"" you will reply. You will embrace suffering. You will finish that last repetition. You will claw through the agonizing pain, you will destroy the mediocre pussy in your head, you will break boundaries. You will rise above the rest. You will realize your potential.

You, anon, are no average man. now go do what you were destined to do. End of fucking story.

- Problems are always easier to face when you aren't running away.

- Virtually all self-destructive and potentially self-destructive behaviors are triggered by anxiety.

- Anxiety, when properly channeled is really fucking useful for getting stuff done.

- Putting something off until I feel like it is the WORST strategy for getting things done. Procrastinating ruins the present and makes the future more difficult.

- Avoiding uncomfortable feelings or thoughts is the most destructive kind of procrastination.

- Motivation is never found or given, it is only created.

- There is always a motive behind my actions. If I am wasting all day online, it is because I am more motivated to be comfortable than I am to grow. 

- I have to choose to want to grow and improve more than to be comfortable. It isn't ever going to happen by itself.

- Every day I push myself, I am amazed by how powerful and capable I am. 

- Every day I run on autopilot, I feel weaker. This is because I am letting the world gain power over me.

- Not everything goes my way. It never will.

- Life isn't perfect. It never will be.

- Anything, no matter how innocuous, can be turned into a drug if my motive is to escape my problems.

- Fantasizing about what I'd like to happen, or what I wish would happen is exactly as worthless as focusing on the past.

- Every day I choose who I am. If I don't make a conscious choice, then I let the world choose for me. 

- I'm pretty fucking badass when I choose to be.

- I'm pretty fucking worthless when I let substances or other people dictate who or what I am.

- Growing a beard is serious business."	t5_2rmfx	True

All the training and sacrifice just flew out the window with one step that I've done millions of times! The frustration is unbearable. The anger is rage. Why the hell did this happen ?!? Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player Or better at 35?!? How in the world am I supposed to do that?? 
I have NO CLUE. Do I have the consistent will to overcome this thing? Maybe I should break out the rocking chair and reminisce on the career that 
was. Maybe this is how my book 
ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me...Then again maybe not! It's 3:30am, my foot feels like dead weight, my head is spinning from the pain meds and I'm wide awake. Forgive my Venting but what's the purpose of social media if I won't bring it to you Real No Image?? Feels good to vent, let it out. To feel as if THIS is the WORST thing EVER! Because After ALL the venting, a real perspective sets in. There are far greater issues/challenges in the world then a torn achilles. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, find the silver lining and get to work with the same belief, same drive and same conviction as ever. 
One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is NOT that day. 
""If you see me in a fight with a bear, prey for the bear"". Ive always loved that quote. Thats ""mamba mentality"" we don't quit, we don't cower, we don't run. We endure and conquer.

Fuck that little voice in the back of my head telling me that it is easier to just soak in self-loathing.  Fuck this uncertainty and fear.  Fuck the easy way out, and finally, Fuck existing.

1334587722.0	scfmk	A Quick Guide to Getting Started	neant	1165	197	61	"**Step 1:** Sit comfortably, take a deep breath, and ask yourself: “What’s more important for me right now, procrastinating or investing time in my future?”  “What do I really gain by procrastinating?” After you realize that procrastination is silly, tell yourself that you are going to study/work for five minutes. In most instances, five minutes is all that it takes to go from panic to productivity.

**Step 2:** Apply the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). This is a tool for time management – you study/work for 25 minutes and then take a short five minute break. This is called a *pomodoro*. After four pomodoros, you take a longer break of 20 minutes. I recommend using [Focus Booster](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/) and setting it to play the ticking sound. How is this useful? It helps you resist interruptions and focus on finishing.

**Step 3:** Adjust your internal dialogue. Read *The Now Habit* by Neil Fiore if you haven’t. By reading this book you will understand that distress comes from the anxiety of delaying projects (among others). Procrastination is a result of things like pressure and fear – the only way to defeat it is by reducing negative emotions. TheCourageWolf wrote a great post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/rxsbz/introduction_to_motivation/) on emotions.

Because your internal dialogue determines how you feel and act, it’s important to change the way you talk to yourself.  I highly recommend replacing the following self-statements:

* Replace “I have to” with “I choose to.”

* Replace “I must finish” with “When can I start?”

* Replace “This is so big” with “I can begin by taking one small step.”

* Replace “I must be perfect” with “I can be human” and accept it.

* Replace “I don’t have time” with “I must take time.”

**Step 4:** Reward yourself after you have earned it and rest.

Note: I wrote this guide for a redditor who needed help on starting to study. Since he or she deleted the post before I could comment, I decided to post it here instead (maybe someone will still find it useful).

[Old, but great comment from 1 year+ ago by a redditor]"	aloneinlove	1178	249	171	"[Stumbled upon this old comment, thought I'll re-post this for the guys out there who feel like this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/e4ejp/dae_feel_like_being_labeled_a_smart_kid_set_them/c158f4b)

Let's examine the reasons behind this result, from a purely theoretical point of view.

When people are given a good label, they make an effort to keep it.

If you're called smart, how do you keep the label? By not trying.

If you try your very best, and fail, then it means you weren't smart enough, or maybe that you're not smart anymore at all. So, you try only a little bit, so you can blame your failure on the attribute that no one seems to care about: lack of motivation. The smarter you are, the less you try, because a supergenius should be able to succeed with almost no effort, right?

Plus, the smartness is really outside of your control. You can't do much to increase your intelligence. Feeling better than others about it would be like feeling better than others because you were born with good looks. So even if eveyone else gives you credit for being smart, if feels weird to give yourself any credit for it. Ironically, it's precisely because you're smart that you come to this realization early on.

Now, what if they didn't praise you for smartness, but praised you for working hard, trying hard, being a go-getter, doing your best always, being motivated, etc.?

Work ethic is something you can control. Your self esteem is no longer tied to some fixed attribute, but to an attribute you can maintain through will. It gives you power over your label.

The only way to keep the label in this case is to actually try your best at things. In fact, it doesn't really matter if you fail, now. If you tried your best, you can still feel proud of yourself no matter what the outcome is. The outcome mattered in the smartness case, but here the process matters.

Lastly, it's an attribute you can genuinely give yourself credit for, because you're the one willing yourself to try your best, so it's not something that you just happened to have at birth.

If you had been praised for being motivated, early 20s (most of reddit) is when you become the most powerful. You're a young adult, and you can finally get things done, and have an influence on the world. Moreover, early 20s is all about taking your life under your control. Those who were praised for being go-getters now shine bright.

But what if you were praised for being smart? When you're in your early 20s, you've lost the amazing superlearning child brain that you used to have. You introspect on your mind, and feel dull. You begin to worry that your time is over, that you can no longer match the learning ability of your younger days, and that your worth has gone down. Now, more than ever, you shy away from trying very hard, to deny this reality and maintain the label.

Is it all the fault of the praisers? No, of course not. They didn't live your life for you. However, they helped define your backwards value system that set you up for poor assessments of yourself. But, you're old enough to redefine those values, and there's no better time than now. After all, in the end, hard work and motivation is a far more praiseworthy thing than smartness. So stop caring if you fail and (this is the hard part) stop caring whether you remain smart in the eyes of others. In their minds, your main attribute should be that you are motivated and always trying and always going above and beyond what effort is asked of you.

During the week, things fall by the wayside and the house gets dirty, laundry piles up, etc. But Sunday is the first day of the week and there is no reason not to attack it with everything you've got.

I do all my laundry, and while that is going on I do my homework for the entire week. I buy and MAKE food for the entire week (something I can just reheat on the go). I clean my entire house from top to bottom. I look at every appointment for the coming week and find out what I need to do so that I can already be prepared the day of and I do it (fill out forms, get documents together, etc.). I also like to go outside, have a beer, watch the sunset and just think about the days ahead and what kind of shit I have to get done because I know I won't have many free seconds once shit starts up.

There is a zen-like feeling on Sunday night knowing that I already conquered the week ahead. My food is made, my work is done, and my house is clean. Anything I do with my free time during the week is icing on the cake.

Since then I managed to create a deck of  over 9300 cards and reviewed them over 80.000 times. I spent over 330 hours studying my deck (ca. 30min a day). My deck now contains about 93% of the commonly used Kanji of the Japanese language.

When I started studying the Japanese writing system, I was overwhelmed by the idea, that I'd have to learn over 2000 different characters to be able to read a newspaper. 
And while the last 600 days were not always easy (I worked most of the time for over 12hours a day) I managed to come much closer to realizing my dream.

A year ago today is when I finally started the uphill battle of my life. I was finishing up my 3rd year of college studying something I hated, and not succeeding at it either. I was maybe a few months out of a very unhealthy relationship after finding out she cheated on me with a good friend of mine. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a job. In November of 2011, while away at school, I found out my dad was diagnosed with leukemia. My childhood dog (and best friend) had suddenly died and I was so lost. All of this caused my confidence to be at an all time low. I saw no reason to succeed at anything. I didn't go to class because I couldn't leave the house. I saw myself as an ugly fat socially awkward kid who had no job and was failing at school. I became lazy and borderline depressed. There was something wrong. My life was on a steady decline.

On May 6, 2012 I gave myself a firm kick in the pants. This was not the path I imagined as a successful high school student. A kid that played on 4 sport teams at a time. I had to take a step back and really think about what I was doing to my future. I set 3 goals for myself: 1. Get a job. 2. Succeed in school. 3. Get back to playing hockey. So, instead of spending the summer at school to get away from my family, I came home for good. That was the most difficult summer of my life, but it had to be done. It had to happen if I ever wanted to turn it around. I enrolled at the local community college for the fall semester. I went out every day looking for a job. And I began to exercise again. I expected to see quick results, and when they didn't come, it was hard to keep going. But I pushed myself. Focusing on the end goal; the ""pinnacle me"". As the summer progressed I saw a gradual change in my physical self and a small change in how I felt. In late August, I got a job doing what I was passionate about. The one place I wanted to work at all along finally worked out. This was huge. My confidence and mood were the best they've been since my freshman year. 

I still have that job. My GPA has never been better. And I'm playing more and more hockey. Goals 1, 2 and 3; done. 18 months after being at the lowest point in my life I'm at the highest point in my life. 

So, after 1 year of hard work, I'm here to say that I'm well on my way to becoming the best I can be. And every single one of you can be too. It all starts with yourself. Be who you WANT to be. Get out there and do it! "	t5_2rmfx	True

Fortunately, on Reddit we can change our bubble! I removed all ""damaging"" or negative subreddits from my subscriptions and replaced them with positive ones. I now have all these inspiring people talking about making something of themselves and actually doing something useful and it was an incredible motivation. Since then, I stopped drinking alcohol, I started doing sports each day, I started reading for 40 minutes in a real book (not just online articles) each day. I started taking concrete steps towards my real dream (having my own business -&gt; started developing Android apps and a blog about my progress), started clearing my inbox each day (previously I never did this resulting in 10000+ mails). Here's some of the subreddits I subscribed to and some posts I found particularly inspiring: http://www.howtobecomewildlypopular.com/2013/02/24/reddit-treasure-trove-the-7-subreddits-that-will-change-your-life/

Computer viruses, printers not working, things like that. So I created a single page outlining all the reasons they needed to bring me on as the IT department. I laid everything out that I thought I could do for them on a typical day, week, month. I then presented it to the owner, the man I had been dealing with for the website.

The owner really liked it, and had a staff meeting proposing the idea of bringing me on. They found a few more things I could do for them. So I officially start Monday. It's for almost 1/2 the pay of my last job, but it will at least cover rent during these hard times. 

It feels good knowing I walked in, said ""You need to hire me"" and made my own position at a 40+year old company. They deal with millions of dollars a year and huge companies. I'm excited.

Whenever you think ""I should do x"" and x takes less than 20 minutes to do then just do it.  Not later, not tonight, not tomorrow, right fucking now.




Hmm, there are a few dishes in the sink...  **Wash them!**

This room could use a vacuuming... **Bust that shit out!**

That girl just smiled at me, I should say hi... **Hi! Do you like golf?**

I should study for school... **Study for 20 minutes!**


If you think of something you should do and it would take awhile, **write it down!**  The physical act of writing things down makes you more likely to do it.

It might seem overwhelming at first because there are probably a lot of little things around the house that need to get done, but after a few days you should have all the non-daily tasks knocked out and it will be good.

I had that sinking feeling of despair and frustration because I just couldn't understand the current material no matter how hard I tried and exams were right around the corner. I felt sick, tired and rife with mental fog, an overall terrible day and stressed to all hell. It might not seem like much, but the past few weeks really caught up with me all at once.

When the lecture ended, I walked outside in a pretty dismal mood, and to make everything worse it was pouring down rain! Not only was I tired, stressed, hungry and miserable, now I was soaking wet. I made it about 30 steps from the lecture hall when out of nowhere I felt this giant raindrop smack right into the side of my face. Only, when I went to brush it off, it turned out it wasn't a raindrop at all. 


A seagull had been flying overhead and out of the crowd of nearly 150 people around me, chose to fling its bird shit right at my face and all over my sweater. In the rain!


And that's what did it, I just stood there wiping this bird shit off of my face, and all I could think was *""ARE YOU KIDDING ME.* WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!""

What are the odds that all of these things happened in a row? I found it so hilarious that I burst out laughing while standing there in the street, in the rain, tired, stressed and covered in birdshit. I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the afternoon. It was the best thing that could have happened to me and I knew it right at that instant.


It made me think about everything, the fact that I am a tiny self aware bag of meat, standing on a floating rock zipping around a giant fireball of a sun, in a galaxy, one among many billions. How absurd it is that I even exist, let alone experience rain soaked torpedo seagull shit splatter across my face."	t5_2rmfx	True

1345418952.0	yhthh	This is your great battle. 	Zansh1n	930	178	74	"We as humans have a tendency to look toward the future, to what can be. To what we WANT. We wonder what it will be like to get there. Maybe it's a beautiful body. Maybe it's a degree. Maybe it's a new job. Maybe it's to finish a book. Maybe to play the guitar. Whatever it is, we fantasize about that moment when the battle is finished and we can enjoy what our hard work has wrought. 

But here's one thing about that success. We also have a tendency to think that the true challenge lies just around the next corner. 

Once you've lost a few pounds of fat, then you can start adding muscle. Once you've gotten into the habit of writing, then you can start on that epic novel. Once you've built up the callouses, then you can learn guitar properly. Once you've got your internal clock sorted, then you'll apply for more jobs. 

We think of the truly hard part as being in the future, some moment where our ""preparation"" will have led to our being ready to smash the demons that stand in our way and achieve success. We think of what we're facing today, right now, as a step along the way, toward that success, toward that state of being that we so desperately want. 

But it's not a step. Today is all there is. Right now is all there is. This is your great battle. There is no moment in your mission that will be more challenging than the one right in front of you. It's all you need to deal with. What you're thinking of, right now - that's it. That's your great battle. 

If you're looking to lose weight and you're having a craving for a candy bar, this is your great battle. 

If you're looking for a job and staying up late instead of getting up early, this is your great battle. 

If you're looking for more than friendship but are having trouble telling that person how you feel, this is your great battle. 

The stories of our culture revolve around grand deeds. Slaying dragons, defeating tyranny, overcoming unspeakable odds. Those are great battles too. Take your inspiration from them. They are the exact same as your great battle. It's standing right in front of you, right now. 

""Once more into the fray. 
Into the greatest battle you'll ever know.
We live and die on this day.
We live and die on this day.""

There will never be a greater moment than the one you're about to live. Conquer it. Your success lies in simply fighting the great battle, every single day of your life. "	t5_2rmfx	True

1342980447.0	wz2ut	[Strategy] Get ready in the morning, even if you don't have anywhere to be.	GodofPH	886	132	54	"Days off/weekends can be a paradox. Not having to go to work sounds like a great time to get things done or be productive right? And yet, many of us lie in bed for half the day. When we wake up, we mull around the house in shorts and tee shirts, probably watching TV, playing video games, internet, whatever. Before long you have a day wasted.

So here's a strategy: On a day off, get up at the same time you would have if you had to go to work/school. Don't just get up though. Get ready for your day. Cook breakfast, shower, brush your teeth, get dressed. Do whatever you do to get ready on a normal day.

This gets you ready to take on the world on days you have to work/school, so why not get yourself ready to take on the world on days off too? There is plenty to do on a day off, and this is a great way to open yourself up to it and not waste a precious day.

EDIT: I understand there are those who have exhausting fulltime jobs or children in their lives (or both!). This strategy is really for redditors who are unemployed or even underemployed. It's a pretty vicious cycle to be caught in when you have so much free time and yet you end up wasting it anyways."	t5_2rmfx	True

We're designed to get better at things with practice. We're designed to push ourselves, and through pushing ourselves, we increase the limit. 

You work out, you gain muscle.

You play an instrument, you play better. 

You run, you can run farther.

You think, you think smarter.

Anything at all, the more you do it, the better you can do it. See those athletes who kick soccer balls into basketball hoops? They started out the same as everybody else. Weedy little kids. But they had a burning passion, and they kept at it. Now they can backflip through car windows. You've seen it, and you know, you can too, if you keep at it.

You write out your problem, I send you a motivational video! I've received phenomenal feedback from people who took me up on my offer. Since this subreddit has quite a substantial user base, this thread might blow the fuck up. Please understand that I am the only person who records the videos, so I might be getting to your video a little later than originally anticipated. 

If you decide to message me, please state whether I can make the video public on my channel or unlisted. If unlisted, only you'll be able to see the video when I send you a link to it. 

As of today, I've made 40 motivational speeches to redditors. I have found by creating these motivational videos that this is my passion. Do not hesitate to message me even if you think I'm overwhelmed! I have the next 2 days off and I fully intend to use the majority of my time making motivational videos for you, :).

[Here is my youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8NEQfikZawvZoxJkHGxLw?feature=mhee). I've created 2 public videos, one to say thank you, while the other is for suicidewatch. I guess it will be a taste of the kind of video you'll receive from me if you decide to message me! 

Cheers.

**Edit #1 @ 9:44 p.m EASTERN TIME.** 
Since this thread began, I've recorded 10 motivational videos! The issue though is that there is about 3 times the number of messages waiting to be replied to, O.O. I need to step away from my computer, and depending on how alert I am when I come back, I may record more tonight. I've been drinking a metric fuck ton of tea to give you the best possible motivational speech I can conjure up! I will be recording the majority of the day tomorrow, so rest assured your personalized motivational video is on its merry fucking way!

**Edit #2 @ 1:01 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I took the time to read a lot of your messages so that I can literally sleep with ideas for great motivational speeches. Time for a good nights rest, and I will be recording as soon as I can. Tabulated number of messages at this current time is **115 requests for personalized motivational speeches**. 

Warning, what I say next may shock you.

**Do not let this deter you from sending me a message with your problems!** 

Cheers, I will talk to you tomorrow.

**Edit #3 @ 1:35 a.m EASTERN TIME**
 I'm calling in some help! Haha, you people never cease to amaze me with your ability to reach out to a stranger for help, :p. Two genuine friends of mine will be joining forces with me to give you a personalized motivational speeches tomorrow at varying times throughout the day, :).

**Edit #4 @ 12:57 p.m EASTERN TIME**
Heh, I just woke up! I guess I was a little more tired than originally anticipated. I need to run a couple of errands, and I'll be back for sure. Today is the day I will tackle a fuck ton of your problems with a motivational speech! When I woke up, I found that I now have a grand total of approximately 170 requests for motivational speeches, :O. I'll do my best to record as many as I possibly can when I come back, promise.

**Edit #5 @ 3:52 p.m EASTERN TIME**

**Edit #6 @ 8:05 p.m EASTERN TIME**
Whew, 4 straight hours of motivational videos and I've managed to record 14 videos in total! I'm done for tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow morning and the evening to record more. Keep being awesome. 

**Edit #7 @ 10:26 p.m EASTERN TIME**
So I've decided to count the number of request I have not been able to get to as of yet, and it's quite substantial. If I calculate how long it will take to get to all your requests, it will take approximately 55 to 60 hours of straight work. I am also in summer school and working 35 hours a week. 

I just want to let you know that I'm in this thing for the long run. I promise I will get back to every request I receive, no matter how long it takes. During this journey I'll formulate a game plan to figure out how to make this idea blow up.   

**Edit #8 @ 1:41 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
Grr, I was only able to record 3 motivational videos before going to class. It's a 3 hour class, so I'll be back around 8 to record some more! I made one public, so hopefully that can tie you over until I get to your personalized motivation speech, :).

**Edit #9 @ 11:23 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 3**
I can't believe how I'm feeling overwhelmed while simultaneously being really motivated. Since inception of this thread, I've created 35 videos, but I still have a lot to go through. Rest assured, there will be a personalized motivational video for you. While it may take a lot longer than expected to have a video sent to you, I will get to you.  

**Edit #10 @ 2:17 a.m EASTERN TIME Day 4**
Oh man, a severe lack of free time is seriously hindering my ability to record messages! I'm working on them, slowly but surely.

**Edit #11 @ 11:53 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 5**
Worked on a couple of videos tonight, but unfortunately I haven't been sleeping a lot lately, so more motivational videos will come tomorrow after work!

**Edit #12 @ 1:44 p.m EASTERN TIME Day 7**
I honestly didn't think this was going to be as mentally draining as it has. While I still plan on getting videos to each and every one of you, I just need to factor in some time for myself so I can be at 100% when I give you motivational speeches! Cheers, and thank you for being so patient. "	t5_2rmfx	True

Live your life as if you have been given a second chance...	simplistic	780	117	80	By that I mean imagine your future self regretting what you didn't do in the past and how it is too late to change things. Imagine your future self wishing to go back in time so that you can finally change and be the person you should have been. Now imagine that your future self's wish of going back in time actually came true, and when you woke up today you are now back in the past, YOU have been given a second chance to change your life right now living in the present. DO NOT waste this oppurtunity!! Stop making excuses and begin to go on that path of becoming a better person! Make your future self proud that you decided to change your life for the better RIGHT NOW in order for you to have a good life not only in the future, but more importantly in the present.	t5_2rmfx	True

1314655691.0	jyebr	Alright, deactivated my facebook, soon to quit this site, and start hitting the gym in pursuit of a 4.0 GPA this semester. Wish me luck. 		770	105	84	"I've wasted far too many semesters saying ""I'll try harder next semester. I'll stop procrastination next semester. Next semester I will blah blah blah...""

Fuck that. I'm tired of wasting my life. This semester I'm taking calc 2, physics, and 2 programming classes. Shit is ridiculous. I spend a lot of time doing work. Its hard to explain, but I'm REALLY motivated to earn all A's this semester. I wake up at exactly 6:00am every day to prepare before my classes start. I'm hungry for success, I want it bad. But there are times when I get severely sidetracked by facebook and reddit.

Facebook - I spent too much trying to talk to people who no longer care about me, or trying to stay current with other people's lives. The few people who I truly care about, and the people who care about me, we see each other in real life. Or talk on the phone. It doesn't make sense for me to stay current with strangers who have no interest in me. At the end of the semester I'll activate the account again however. 

Reddit - damn. I love this site, but it too, is a distraction. 

I haven't been to the gym in a while, but I need to lose at least 30 pounds by the end of the year. When I look good, I feel good. I'm totally not content with my appearance and I feel like shit about it. Time to change that. 

Anyway, I understand that I CAN keep my facebook/reddit accounts active while still doing well in school. Sure, I know people will argue that. I used to have the same mentality too but it never got me anywhere. But I'm not that type of guy (anymore). I'm either going to devote myself 100% and succeed or I'm not going to do it at all. No half-assed effort. So this will likely be my last post until about December. Wish me luck guys.

1327506728.0	ow5bf	Got fired...into a hungry job market. Details inside.	avise_la_fin	866	215	139	"Last Tuesday, my boss calls me in.  ""How do you think things are going?""  I shake my head, and he says, ""We agree, then.  Today is your last day.  Leave your work truck, credit card, and laptop.  Jeff will take you home.""

So there I sat, fired for the first time in my life, for failing to meet expectations that were never clear to begin with.  I have a wife, a son, and that same morning, found out we had another precious life on the way.  The hour-long ride home, I sat there trying not to cry, worrying about how we could make it on my wife's income until I could find employment.

Wait, that's not what happened at all.  By the time I got home, I had lined up three meetings for later in the week with potential employers.  All three told me they didn't care about me being fired...they'd worked with me in the past and knew what I was worth.  I took all three of those meetings, and all three said they would move forward with me.

So, one week and one day after being shit-canned for the first time ever, I'm depositing my first retainer check from a new business partner.  I'll be designing his farm GPS/GIS infrastructure, migrating him to a new accounting program, and integrating a harvest management system.  

As I write this, another of those contacts is closing a round of investment in his farm for several million dollars...a relationship I began for him at the job I'd just been fired from.  The farmer will be using me to get his proverbial shit together for financials and technology.  That investment bank will be bringing me on as an independent consultant to get them in front of more investment opportunities.  Finally, another business contact will be using me to design and build his business plan and marketing materials for his new realty business.

One hour.  One measly hour after being fired, I'd set the wheels in motion for all of that.  I'll make more in the next year than I would have at my old job.  It won't be easy, but my family will not taste the pain of hunger and threadbare Christmases.  They WILL NOT have the life I was raised in.  Fuck defeat.  It's for weaker souls.

You can do this, whatever it might be.  You can get that job...finish your degree...ask her out...ace that final...lose that weight...assemble that Ikea chair.  Eat fear, shit success.  Good luck, my fellow wolves.

*Edit 2*:  Let me be clear about something...the purpose of this wasn't to fill my vault with attaboys and swim in them like Scrooge McDuck.  There's a few people who've commented saying that this helped them.  *That's* what I wanted.  Everything on this subreddit is about getting off your ass, pimp-slapping failure, achieving your dreams, etc.  I wanted to show all of the wolves that taking life's best right hook and getting off the floor is absolutely possible.  You have all inspired me with your stories and posts over the past few months, and I wanted to give a little bit of that back.  Thank you to everyone who encourages and inspires me and the rest of the pack with their victories, large and small.

Except.. He's not working like you were working, nowhere near. He is NOTHING like you. Infact, the STRENGTH you feel just by being in his presence, makes you whisper to yourself, ""woah"".

He has a look in eye, an uprightness to his posture and an spiritual energy that tells you, without any words spoken that he is getting what he wants. Whatever it is. Full stop.

Your hairs stand on end like you just came across a Lion, and he's staring right at you about to pounce. But you're twin is not even looking at you. He has no awareness of your presence. He is focused.

You know at this point that you're looking at something very strange. The likes of which, you have never seen live, in the flesh, before. 

He is not even an alpha male. He is something much bigger, much stronger than that.

He is greatness.

You get a sense standing next to him, that this is what it must have been like to stand next to Alexander The Great, Winston Churchill or Napoleon Bonaparte in their prime. 

But he is not them. He is you, down to the bone. There is nothing in him that is not in you.

You know this.

I know you do, deep down, we all do.

Despite this, the question always seems to remain.

Why aren't you that guy?

The answer is FEAR.

The only thing separating you from that guy is this four letter word. That's it.

1324565944.0	nmnm6	How I got rid of my Social Anxiety.	RedErin	816	214	215	"I've been getting asked about this pretty often, so I decided to make a post about it. 

My whole life I've been really shy. I hated it. I couldn't make phone calls. My family would be mad at me because I'd never talk to them. I would lose friends because I wouldn't make the effort to contact them. My work life suffered. If I saw an old friend at the mall I would hide. But I thought ""that's just the way I am."" 

But a few things happened in my life that showed me that I don't have to be like that if I don't want to. 

1. On my 28th Birthday, a friend gave me some mdma (Ecstasy).(I'm not recommending drugs here btw.) On it, I loved everyone, wanted to talk and touch everyone. I was the life of the party, a social butterfly. I wanted to be like that every day. 

2. Psychology. I've always loved social sciences, and it's proven that phobias are treatable. And that's what I had, an irrational fear of humans. :) (Mixed with low confidence)

3. Reddit. There's a lot of self-help subreddits that helped me. r/getmotivated, r/loveyourslef, r/TwoXchromosomes, and r/seduction. I know r/seduction has a bad reputation, but it really is made for people who have anxiety and undeveloped social skills, and teaches them how to be confident. 

4. I learned to dance. This is like a booster shot of liquid self-esteem. When you're able to just flail your arms and shake your booty without a care in the world as to what other people think about it. It's really freeing. 

So in the last two years, I've been on a mission to rid myself of my shyness. It's not completely gone, but I'm more than halfway there, and I've never been happier. It's fucking hard work, but omg is it worth it. 

Things I do to practice. 

- Look people in the eye when I talk to them. Always terrifying to me before, but gets easier pretty quickly. 

- Smile. It's cliché, but it has lots of positive effects. It makes your brain think you're happy, so it releases dopamine. People think you're friendly so they're more likely to talk to you. 

- Talk to All The People! Make small talk, then ask open-ended questions. Asking open ended questions is what makes a real connection with others possible. It allows you to really get to know someone. 

- Allow yourself to love yourself. Say supportive and positive things in your mind, or even out loud. Things like ""You're awesome!"", ""I'm the Boss!"", and things like that. [Self Fulfilling Prophecies work.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) (Just don't become arrogant, you will if you take it too far.)

- Start liking people more. I used think I hated people. But I think that was just my brain making excuses because it was afraid of them. I saw a quote from Niel Gaiman that really resonated with me.

2.Believe in yourself, or no one else will.

3.Make the choice to be happy, no matter what is going on around you. Being sad does nothing, do what you can and let everything else go.

4.Remember your goals. Set them. Tackle them. Finish them. If you get discouraged, break it down into smaller goals. Finish no matter what. Do not make finishing a task, make it a habit.

5.Take care of your mind and body. Eat well. Stretch. Workout.

6.Take it one step at a time. Keep pushing.

7.You are what you consistently do.

8.Consistent small changes add up to big changes.

9.Never forget to have fun. Find the fun in anything. Remember perspective.

10.Any decision is better than no decision. Failure is better than not doing at all."	t5_2rmfx	True
1337312087.0	tsrec	To those of you who are losing your motivation, or having trouble finding it in the first place, I am sharing my sincerest thoughts with you.	hyptian	711	119	104	"Sometimes you're discouraged. You lose sight of why you decided to work this hard in the first place. You forget your goals and intentions. You misplace that motivation that drove you in the first place.  

Sometimes, I know, all you want to do is give up. You've been climbing this mountain for who knows how long and you have no idea when you'll ever reach the top.  

But here's the thing. Stop climbing for a second and turn around.  

Look.  

Look at how far you've already come. Look at where you started. Look at how hard it was to start this journey in the first place. Look at how steep that mountain was at times but you kept pushing through it anyway. Look at it all and be proud of yourself. Find the joy in even the smallest of accomplishments. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back, damn it.   

Whether you're almost at the top, or whether you've just started, do not undermine how much you've accomplished.   

If you give up, you'll just roll down that hill and be farther to your goal, not closer to it. If you let go, you'll have to start all over again.    

You've made it through so much already. You can't stop now. You don't want to have to start over again.   

You tripped? You messed up? You skipped a day? A week? A month? You've regressed? So, what? This is YOUR mountain. Nobody else's. You're not a failure. You're a wolf. You're going to get back up with even more willpower than when you started and you're going to KEEP GOING.    

Think of future you, standing up there with the utmost pride and purest happiness. Think of her/him telling you not to give up. Yelling at you to get up and keep going. Thanking YOU for doing all of this for YOURSELF.   

Don't think about your excuses. None of them are reasons.  

""Oh, but I...""  

""No, you don't understand, it's different for me, I...""  

""No, seriously, listen, this JUST happened to me, and I...""  

No. You listen. You will not change unless you decide to change. Your life will not change unless you decide to change it yourself.   

There will always be reasons why you shouldn't do it. Only think of the reasons why you should.  

Change and improvement are 99% mental. Your legs will run if you tell them to. Your lips will speak if you tell them to. Your lungs will not collapse. Your arms will not fall off. Your unhealthy food/alcohol/drugs will not run away. It'll be there tomorrow. You don't need it. You don't have to have it right now. You're in control. You're the writer of your own destiny. Just do it one day at a time. You can conquer this.  

Seriously. You can't expect to knock down a wall by tapping on it. You need to get at it with full force.  

Rock on, dear wolves.  

Rock. On.

Edit 1: Wow. I feel that I really have to say to everyone, ""you are so welcome."" I was just getting down on myself yesterday and decided to stop and give myself a little pep talk. Started typing it up on here immediately in the hopes of helping to pick someone back up along the way as well. It brings me such joy to know that I may have helped someone realize or refresh their potential.

Thank YOU."	t5_2rmfx	True

My new job allows me to work with entrepreneurs all the time. This constant can only prove helpful for the future.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...

I WAITED UNTIL I FOUND THE RIGHT JOB, WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE, WITH THE RIGHT SALARY before I decided to quit my old job. PATIENCE is so important with ambitions and finances. Which leads me to the last pro...

It's an entry level job - and I get to use my new-found endurance to enjoy myself as I work my way to the top.

At any point in my life I can say ""this, this is why I didn't need to grow up"".

I was protected by my parents.

I was protected by the money I earned.

I was protected by people going easy on me.

And never did I take responsibility. Never did I work hard. Never did I do things because they needed to be done - instead I just did the minimum to get around - and for the rest found excuses.

I have lived like a child, all my life.

And I am in my twenties and still I live like a child.

I complain about the things I lack - instead of working for them.

I complain about the things others don't do - instead of doing them myself.

I worry about what might come - but I don't plan anything.

I pity myself in my sadness or worries - instead of acting upon them.

I wonder why I sit alone at home - instead of going out and making friends.

I hate myself for not learning the skills or languages I want to learn - instead of making the effort.

All my life I have lived like a child. All my life I was too scared or worried or lazy or distracted or immature to stand up and say:

This is what I want, and I will make it happen.

This is the person I want to meet and I will meet him.

This is the job I want and I will fight my ass off to get it.

This is the book I need to know and I will sit down and I will not eat or drink until I have finished it.

This is the world I want to conquer and I will not give up until I have conquered it.

Now is the time. Now is the time that I need to stand up and fight.

Why now?

Because else it is too late.

The longer I wait, the longer I keep thinking and speaking and acting like a child, the longer I will stay a child.

The longer I wait, the more unreachable will my goals become.

The longer I wait, the shorter is the time that I can be a man.

The longer I wait, the more of my life will I have wasted.

Today is the day I will become a man.

Today is the day I will think like a man, speak like a man and act like a man.

Today and every day from now:

I will be there for those that need me.

I will stand up for what is right.

I will do what needs to be done.

I will fight for what I want.

I will persevere, even when things get hard.

I will work even when I feel lazy.

I will do sport even when my body aches.

I will learn even when my mind feels numb.

I will meet people even when I'm scared.

I will speak when I need to speak.

I will work when I need to work.

I will be what I want to be.


Today I will be a man."	t5_2rmfx	True

But I won't. I won't let the world win.

Instead, I make a healthy dinner of homemade hummus and eat it with freshly cut carrots. I take my time making dinner, I need to find enjoyment in the process. I plan what I will take for lunch tomorrow.

It's raining outside. Well now how am I supposed to get in my run? I stop thinking. I start planning a workout at home. Push-ups, sit-ups, squat thrusts, stretches. I won't let the world win.

I'm lonely. Why hasn't anyone responded to the many messages I have sent on on-line dating? What's wrong with me? I stop thinking about other people and their lives. I focus on mine. What can I improve?

I lost my apartment, my job, my boyfriend, and my license. I crashed my car. I had an abortion. All within a month. As a result of all these things I did horribly in school and almost lost my financial aid.

But I've never been a defeatist. I've been slowly revamping my life and getting to where I want to be.

Yesterday I signed a lease on a new house. I've been gainfully employed for almost a year, I saved up for an excellent bicycle, my GPA last semester was a 3.8, I fixed and sold my car, I've made tons of new friends and developed healthy, meaningful relationships. I'm making art again and life is honestly a little bit too beautiful right now.

I don't know if this is necessarily the right subreddit, or if anybody is even interested. I kinda just wanted to brag :P
