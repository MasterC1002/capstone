It has opened up new worlds of music to me, enriched me culturally, and deepened my understanding of music. Despite sometimes lacking obvious features (like the ability to cmd + F and search through the page not just in our own playlist) I am truly grateful for a service like this and you should feel proud of yourselves for putting together such a ground-breaking service. 

Sincerely,

Hopefully the money walking out the door will speak more to Spotify than customers bugging them for it and then just begrudgingly putting up with it.

So when Discover came along, I was super excited.  I envisioned a more streamlined, personally catered version of what I do manually each week.

**The information contained in this post is 4 months old, and no longer relevant. After the Android update released in early June, I have re-subscribed to Spotify and have been quite, quite happy with my service and the updates made to the UI, stability, and performance of Spotify on Android.**


I finally gave up on Spotify. I've been a paying Premium member for right around 6 months now, and I use Spotify from my phone. In that time, the only noticeable advancement in the UI or feature-list of the mobile (Android) app has been the introduction of gapless playback. The app is still incredibly unstable, lacking what seem like obvious features (with no indication whatsover from Spotify that they are making any progress addressing these issues), and is just generally a headache to use.

So I left. Here's what I left when asked why I'm canceling my subscription:

-------------------

I've been paying $10/month for Spotify Premium - the main sell being the privilege of having Spotify on my mobile phone. Unfortunately, the (Android) app is an abomination. 

The content it accesses is great, but providing access to the music is not sufficient if the UI is garbage. My complaints include: frequent crashes, inconsistent UI (e.g. long-press functionality varies depending if you search a song explicitly or find it by browsing to an artist/album first or select it from an existing playlist), no library sorting options, no gapless playback on local files, service outages unrelated to mobile coverage - the list goes on. These are ongoing too - updates appear to be minor and in 6+ months have yet to fix core flaws with the app.

Don't get me wrong, I actually really like Spotify, and the desktop app has improved by leaps and bounds since I first signed up, but my uses are almost exclusively mobile. I feel that the mobile users have been largely ignored, and for $10/month, that's not ok.

I will watch Spotify's progress, but for now, it's just not what I need. I'm jumping ship to Rdio.

---------------------

I'm just tired of feeling like I'm paying extra for a feature (the mobile app) that isn't being properly supported. I've used alpha builds of software/apps that were miles more stable / polished. So I'm out. I may just be one user, but I hope someone reads what I wrote and takes it to heart. I really wanted to like it, but it just no longer seems to be the best option for what I want to do."	t5_2qofj	True

****

*Playlist Time

I have no idea how long my playlists are anymore.  I make playlists to be a specific time for specific tasks, but I can't anymore (and I used to spend days tweeking a playlist just right to fit the amount of time).  For example, we use Spotify playlists for figure drawing sessions, but I might have to go to another method now.

*Searching for Songs on Artists' Pages

I also can't use the Ctrl+F search on artists' pages if I want to find a particular song anymore.  Now I have to do it through search.  So much for the search suggestion drop-down list; there's no need for it anymore if I'm going to just use the main search results anyway.

Again, please correct me if I'm wrong about these.

I enjoyed developing for them A LOT. It's all HTML5 + Javascript + javascript API, all running inside Chromium (so there's are no browser compatibility issues). I think it was a great choice on their part, since there are so many great web developers out there.

Their API is *fast*. I have no idea how they did it, but they did it right. We'll see how it scales, it's too early to judge.

I see a lot of potential in this platform.

One huge downside (and they announced it today at the conference) is that there is no profit sharing or paid apps at this stage, so I don't see any real advantages, unless you already have a music-related site / service and want to drive more traffic or gain customers. I hope they reconsider, it can really be a game changer."	t5_2qofj	True

So I sent in a complaint/message using the press release contact form, explaining my situation and who I was. Well, an hour or so later, someone emailed me back! They said they could help, and asked me to verify my account information. After verifying my account information, they deleted my account. Then, they instructed me to simply create a new account with my same email address and email them. Once I created my new account, they gave me a 30 day credit AGAIN AND copied over all of my playlists from my old account!


 Just wanted to share this incredible customer service experience, it took place over the course of only 4 emails, was seamless, and was the exact solution to my problem. Good shit spotify!!

This is every song that has ever played on NPR's ""Marketplace"". They truly have some of the best taste I've ever heard, and it is hands down one of the best shows on NPR today.

This playlist only contains the songs Spotify has so it's not complete, but it's enough.

~~[The List](http://open.spotify.com/user/1214043627/playlist/4vJu0I0uzmlpLP3cfFPtCr)~~

~~**EDIT:** /u/Adium remove all the duplicates the other day. Go give him some [upboats](http://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/1e7rv4/every_song_ever_played_on_nprs_marketplace_xpost/c9xp2hf). And here's a link to this new and improved playlist [the list](http://open.spotify.com/user/admish/playlist/7srcWBrUCIZLXNORtRhYNk).~~

**EDIT2:** So I realized there were a ton of errors after looking at the file my scraper returned. I've spent the past couple of days rewriting the crawler and now it works error free as far as I can tell. I also wrote my own program to remove duplicates from the list. The problem though now is a lot of the songs come with funny tags like (Instrumental) or (feat. So and So) and the service I use to generate the playlists can't handle that very well. For instance I had to remove all the [Explicit] tags in order to get the one song I knew needed to be on there which was, ""Lemonade"" by Gucci Mane. This list has 600 more songs than the one down in the comments.

If I can get to it today I hope to make a way to update the play list every time Marketplace does. Fingers crossed! There's also the issue of the approximately 3000 songs that Spotify either doesn't have or can't find. I've been working hard on this so don't say OP never did anything for yah!

**I call this one: [Marketplace.org Playlist MkVI](http://open.spotify.com/user/1214043627/playlist/6nFxweTaJVNHyfJAf7ytU8)**

Also if you've never listened NPR's Marketplace thou shouldst! Support public radio y'all it's the best radio we've got!

**ISSUE:** ~~Let me know if the playlist isn't showing up for you. It's not showing up on my other devices.~~ I think I managed to bypass the current spotify playlist bug where it won't update if you post more than 300 songs at a time. Had to hand copy and paste all that. Anywho, I'll be updating and fixing this playlist from time to time. Enjoy.

1375611004.0	1joamg	Spotify for Mac has become unbearably slow	fletcherchase	41	5	17	"Dear Spotify team,

Like any tech geek, I love new features. I love that you are attempting to integrate new social features into Spotify. I love that you are working to develop better music discovery. I love that we now have Radio.  I love that there are almost 100 add-on apps now available.

However, the tax on system resources is increasingly outweighing the feature benefits.  I have been with you since the first day Spotify became available in the United States.  I was *amazed* at how fast it would load. Now, two years later, it can take up to 2 minutes to start up on my machine. Often the Activity sidebar or other features will never load. Even iTunes opens faster which is really saying something.  Your software has become completely inefficient.

I understand you are spread thin. I realize you have to simultaneously develop for several different operating systems. I appreciate that you recently came out with the web player.  That being said, I think your greatest priority should always be on software efficiency and maintaining high performance standards with far less compromise.

Sincerely,

fletcherchase"	t5_2qofj	True

there is an open SDK and any developer can develop for the Chromecast. they mentioned Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora, but not Spotify.
 
It would be fantastic if Spotify had an app for the Chromecast. I play music in my living room all the time and i usually do it by directly plugging my computer into my reciever (which the TV is already plugged into). just being able to do it wirelessly and have all of spotify's library available to stream anywhere would be fantastic.

1373306957.0	1hvmgt	Hey guys! I made a simple tool that helps you import your Pandora bookmarks and likes into Spotify.	jfktrey	32	2	11	"It's not a pretty program, but it works! Log in to Pandora, tell it what you want to download, and it spits out a list of all your bookmarks and likes. You can download it on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pandora-unchained/downloads/detail?name=interface2.exe). Currently, it's only packaged for Windows (though, if you have Python, you can run it - see below).

It's not a fully integrated solution - it relies on [Ivy](http://www.ivyishere.org/ivy) to take your song list and give it to you in a format that you can paste into Spotify. For a couple days of work, though, I think this turned out well.

If you're interested, you can see its [source code on my GitHub](https://github.com/jfktrey/Pandora-Unchained).

1368996717.0	1enghm	OK, so I'm sticking with Spotify. For now. (A slight GPMAA rant)	Push-Pull	39	10	21	"I played around with Google Play Music All Access for a few days. I loved it. I loved the layout, I loved the Droid App, I loved the radio (and how I could save it as a playlist for later). It really did seem to be a Spotify Killer at first glance. 

And then I started looking closer at the stuff I wanted it to do for me.
I run Spotify mostly from an old Droid I have, and DL stuff to it while it's on wifi so I don't have to tie up my regular phone as well as save on my usage. Google, you need to figure out how Spotify does this, because you guys suck at it. 

As an example, I DL'd about 500 songs to my Droid in about 2 hours today through Spotify. It took me over 3 hours for a 125 song playlist from Google. 

And then there's the bandwidth issue. Google devoured 2.45G of data in about 5 hours of streaming. Now, I'm grandfathered in (for now, I'm not sure if I'm going to subsidize my next phone or not to keep unlimited) so using that data isn't a big deal to me, but at the same time, there's something to be said about being a little aware of how much you use. At any rate, I don't think I hit 1g for an entire day's worth of Spotify streaming.

Now, I've heard how people like Google for the combining of their 'owned' music and how can't do so with Spotify. (Well, you can, but I gotta admit that Google makes this stupid easy...) I don't know why they don't know that Spotify does this already, and does it in a way that trades less bandwidth for more room in device storage. I've had all my gap fillers on Spotify pretty much since day one, and using Dropbox, it's stupid easy to keep two laptops, a desktop, two phones, and a tablet synced up.

I've also heard how people like the Radio feature of Google over Spotify, that somehow it's more relevant. I guess these people aren't willing to get dirty looking through Tunigo, ShareMyPlaylists and others to find relevant playlists for great music discovery. And I have to wonder if they've EVER bothered clicking the ""Related Artists"" tab in Spotify. I spend hours sometimes just following the rabbit down the hole and coming up with tons of new stuff I like.

Even the 'Shuffle' issue has a workaround, albeit it takes a little effort outside of Spotify to make it work. 

I seriously considered using Google and cancelling Spotify, but I just can't get over Google's two biggest issues when most everything else is on close to equal footing, or even slanted slightly to Spotify's favor. I couldn't see jumping ship and starting over just for the sake of doing it. 

I do have one hope, and that is that Spotify takes notes on some of the things that Google is doing right (owned music intergration, adding albums to your collection instead of as a playlist, etc, etc) and attempts to improve on the things that are commonly complained about. (Shuffle feature, making 'owned' music integration much easier, profile pics without FB integration, etc.) You may have kept me for now Spotify, but I guarantee that many are jumping ship because of a multitude of minor issues that should have been fixed a long time ago. 

And if Google happens to fix the DL time and data usage issues I brought up, well then.....

1368298471.0	1e53lz	a small note about CoffeeTwoSugars being a mod	dodidodidodidodi	32	1	1	"We're an ""unofficial"" spotify reddit primarily made to share playlists and talk about spotify.  

As more and more people are posting, reaching out for help here, spotify employees have come and tried to help people with their problems.  To mark them out we have been giving them flair when they have asked for it.

We had been going through a process of emailing employee's at their official email address and getting replies before adding the flair,  which works but its much easier to just give one employee the tools to do it themselves.  So we have.

Originally we were not sure it'd be a good idea to have Spotify employees as moderators, as it could lead to people accusing them of censoring negative posts.  Hence this post detailing the fact that CoffeeTwoSugars can **only** edit flair.

TLDR 
CoffeeTwoSugars only has the rights to change flair and can't edit posts etc.

1360130536.0	17zhuh	I made a Chrome extension that finds the song that's currently playing in Songza on Spotify. Interested?	deadcow5	37	6	14	"Anyone here use Songza? Did you ever discover an awesome track there  and wanted to add it to your favorite playlist on Spotify? 

I've been in this situation a bunch of times â frequently enough that it got to the point where I wished there was an easier way, like a button on Songza that opens the current song in Spotify. I couldn't find anything like that on the Internet, so I made it myself :)

Here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lITWnNW.png). Basically, it works like this: if you're on Songza.com, a small Spotify icon appears in the omnibar and when you click on it, it opens a popup showing all the matching songs on Spotify! Artist, album, title, even the cover! And the best: one click opens the artist/album/track page on Spotify in a new browser tab and in Spotify, so all you have to do is add it to a playlist. 

I thought this sub might appreciate this tool. Let me know in the comments if you would like to try it, if there's enough interest, I will cough up the 5 bucks and register it on the Chrome Web Store.

Let me know!

EDIT: wow, I that's a better response than I expected. Ok then, I'll release this thing. Having trouble signing into my Google account right now, so bear with me. I'll get it up as soon as I can.

I started playing the violin in kindergarten (I'm 30 now) and was brought up with classical music. I really didn't get into modern music until my mid teens. So I have a head start but honestly it is incredible to me just how small of a part classical music plays in people's lives. I'm no virtuoso violinist. In fact I'm not even all that good at it, never had the finesse necessary to really make something of it. I'm not an expert in classical music by any means either. My favorite band of all time is Radiohead and right now my playlists are full of cut/copy, dr. dog, skrillex, miniature tigers, the walkmen, etc...

Anyways the reason I tell you all this is that I figure some of you might be curious but not even know where to start with classical music. So I want to share with you a series of short pieces (""variations"") by Edward Elgar that are truly amazing. 

Because in my years of listening to modern music I have heard some powerful stuff but rarely anything that gives me goosebumps or much less make my eyes water. I'm not talking about sadness but of sonic beauty, of something so spectacular that you can experience moments of euphoria by simply listening and letting the drama of the music take you away from reality for a little while.

For those of you willing to give it a try you need to hear me out on this. You shouldn't just put it on in the background and read a book or study. Well you can but I suggest that the first time that you listen to this you find a nice calm comfortable and quiet place where you will not be interrupted. Put on some headphones too, even if you have a nice stereo, it'll be more powerful at your ears.

Turn it up to a comfortable but semi loud volume (it will get louder so make sure you're prepared) and start with the first variation. Don't let it shuffle! Go in order, pay attention to whats going on and let the music take you away.

It's not the most exciting at the beginning, but that's the point. You have to let it build up. By the time you get to Nimrod (variation 10) I assure you the music will have your full attention. If it doesn't then classical music might just not be for you, and that's totally cool! 

I'm curious what your impressions are. Please don't be shy, I want to know if it did anything for you, if it succeeded in giving you a few goosebumps down your neck and back, or if it was a total waste of time. But only if you gave it your full attention for all 15 tracks (some are less than a minute). Hey maybe I'm just over sentimental or something! 

The story behind the Enigma Variations is quite interesting, if after you're done listening to it once or twice or five time like I did my first time you're curious google it it's too much to type here.

Ok so without further diarrhea of the mouth I present to you [Edward Elgar's Variations on a Theme](http://open.spotify.com/user/snowfro/playlist/5HCzoMGP6pq7deVYvGseHt).

tl;dr - an amazing piece of classical music give it an uninterrupted listen with some headphones in a comfy place and let me know what you think"	t5_2qofj	True

Of course, when I go to play the song on my Netbook the song is missing, so I've made a Dropbox folder called 'Syned Music' that my Spotify monitors on both computers and keeps my playlist working on both PC's.

This obviously isn't good if you want loads of songs synced and don't have much Dropbox space, but its great for those crazy little mashups that don't have a home on Spotify.

Here's the thing: when you have people over and you're on the couch, it's hard being social when you constantly have to walk over to your desktop to skip an unwanted track, put on somebody's request or find a new album to play. I pretty much end up sitting behind my PC half the time.

In these situations, doing all this through the mobile app is way better.

It could be as simple as just switching playback from mobile to desktop. They already have the web-app that can control Spotify via its protocol so it shouldn't be too hard to implement playback requests over the web from the app.

First of all you're going to want to get [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/). AHK is a program that allows you to map hotkeys to do specific things, including outside of Spotify. For example, I lock my computer by double tapping the enter key on the numpad, instead of winkey+L.

Next open up the default script (I think it'll be named AutoHotKey.ahk), and replace all of what is in there with this:

    SetTitleMatchMode 2

    ; ""CTRL + LEFT""  for previous
    ^Left::
    DetectHiddenWindows, On
    ControlSend, ahk_parent, ^{Left}, ahk_class SpotifyMainWindow
    DetectHiddenWindows, Off
    return
    
    
    ; ""CTRL + RIGHT""  for next
    ^Right::
    {
    DetectHiddenWindows, On
    ControlSend, ahk_parent, ^{Right}, ahk_class SpotifyMainWindow
    DetectHiddenWindows, Off
    return
    }
    
    ; ""CTRL + UP""  to star
    ^UP::
    {
    CoordMode, Mouse, Relative
    ;star currently playing
    +^l::
    SpotifyWinHeight = 1050 ;set to 1080 - 30 for small taskbar size, just in case WinGetPos doesn't work for some reason
    WinGetActiveTitle, CurWindow
    WinActivate Spotify
    WinWaitActive Spotify
    WinGetPos,  ,  ,  , SpotifyWinHeight, Spotify
    ;          X  Y  W  H, we don't care about anything but height
    RightClickTarget := SpotifyWinHeight - 250
    ContextMenuTarget := RightClickTarget + 110
    MouseMove, 100, %RightClickTarget%
    Click Right
    Sleep, 50
    MouseMove, 180, %ContextMenuTarget%
    Sleep, 50
    Click
    WinActivate %CurWindow%
    return
    }
    
    ; ""CTRL + DOWN""  to pause
    ^Down::
    {
    DetectHiddenWindows, On
    ControlSend, ahk_parent, {space}, ahk_class SpotifyMainWindow
    DetectHiddenWindows, Off
    return
    }

1368880217.0	1eknw5	The only thing holding me back from subscribing to premium is the inability to export playlists	oreography	22	0	7	"I love using spotify but I don't want to get locked into a platform without the ability to lose track of my music library. With itunes I can import my playlist library into spotify/windows media player etc which gives me reassurance if I ever wanted to switch to a different program, but with spotify you import the playlists and there's no exporting - not even for local files. 

Being an android user, I'd love the ability to have my itunes playlists all properly loaded/synced. I use isyncr but unfortunately it's far from perfect. I've spent quite a while manually organizing metatags and playlists for my local files and it would suck if I joined spotify, spent hours more organzing playlists in it and then not being able to take them with me. 

Obviously any spotify hosted/non local files in the playlists wouldn't be useable without spotify and I understand that, but it would be nice to be able to import a playlist file generated from spotify into another music management program as a reassurance that if you ever did want to leave, although you lose access to playing unlimited music you still have a record of them, and you could replace the cloud tracks with purchased local ones. 

I know that there are some spotify employees on here so I'm hoping you guys take it onboard. I read an article recently about a man unsubscribing from the service for the same reason, he didn't want to feel ""trapped"" in using the service. "	t5_2qofj	True

But seriously, why can't they play them at the volume of the music, or hey, even just a tad bit quieter?  

Instead they're following the same BS model that has pissed everyone off about TV since the 80s.  I'm driving around, listening to music, and suddenly my speakers are nearly blown out by an ad for some insurance company or whatever.  

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.

Edit: Since a bunch of people are making assumptions, a few being quite rude about it, to clarify a bit - I use (and pay) for Pandora at the moment.  But it's radio function has left me feeling pretty ""blah.""  You add a band to create a station, and then you hear the exact same songs every single f'ing day.  So I was **testing Spotify's radio to see if it was better.**  I don't particularly care for/need the ability to access any song I want at any time.  I just want a good radio app that plays a variety of music instead of (what seems to be the case with Pandora) a single playlist on shuffle.

Ideally, I would like it to figure out what I don't like, but I think it might just operate on a song-by-song basis, rather than figuring out that I don't like an entire artist (Coldplay, Modest Mouse) or an entire album (The *Into the Wild* soundtrack). I'm not even sure it doesn't play the songs I have given a thumbs down to again...

I guess I just wish that these kind of Pandora-esque (and even Pandora) players would give you the option to say why you didn't like the song you gave a thumbs down to. Something with choices like

* I don't like this artist in general
* I like this artist, but not this album
* I like this artist, I like this album, but I'm sick of hearing this song

Collaborative playlists

Team playlists are also possible with Spotify. You and your friends share a playlist, and each of you can add or remove tracks. Until itâs perfect. Or not.

Just right-click your playlist and select âCollaborative playlistâ. These playlists will appear with a green icon and text, and theyâll sync automatically between the different users managing that playlist.

Remember: whoever you share the playlist with will be able to edit it.

For playlists youâve created yourself, you can turn on or off the âCollaborative playlistsâ option at any time. If it all gets too much. Or you need to be on your own.

1.  No more than 3 - 5 tracks by any one artist (unless the entire album is justifiably creepy).

It made me think about just how much I use and rely on Spotify. I've had a no-ads account for a year+ now, and a premium account since last fall. I sign in on my iPhone &amp; iPad daily, as well as randomly on my personal notebook and any one of ten different machines at work. Having one library regardless of device is my one single most killer-feature. 

iTunes never ever gets opened anymore, except for by accident (followed by much cursing). When I was using iTunes I probably had ~50,000 songs indexed but had only ever listened to a fraction of that total. With spotify, though, while at the same time it's trivial to add another artist or album I find myself being more careful &amp; selective with what gets added to my permanent library playlists so that I don't end up with the same mess that I had before.

My Spotify library currently has 302 stared tracks, 973 albums, 179 playlists &amp; 3844 tracks and it makes me wonder - in a crowd of /r/Spotify enthusiasts, does that make me a pansy/light/medium/heavy user of the service?  "	t5_2qofj	True

1343069415.0	x1248	Return to Metropolis	kneeofwisdom	18	3	7	"A while back, I posted an 18 track playlist called ""[Night's Drive Through Metropolis](http://open.spotify.com/user/nerpnerp/playlist/6AsiwiyVuF1H8zhlC2I6Ii)"" - a collection of songs envisioning a night's drive through a bleak futuristic cityscape.

Now, here is the followup to that playlist, a 16 track collection called ""[Return to Metropolis](http://open.spotify.com/user/nerpnerp/playlist/5OSb0Cv9FhRsU5IeCxQxDe)"".

These are meant to be listened to in order, so make sure shuffle is off on your player.  Slap on some headphones, lay back, and enjoy the trip!

**Edited for correct track numbering.*

**EDIT 07/27** - Didn't anticipate to have another one done so quickly, but it just kind of came together.

*addition 2:* I signed up for a 14 day trial on MOG here: https://mog.com/plans?trial_key=fourteen_day_cc_trial
They do have a lot of Facebook integration but it's not in the way, I filtered it out.

I wanted to sign up, but then I saw that their FAQ says:
""What personal information does Facebook share with Spotify?
Facebook will share **very basic personal information** such as **email address, username, gender, date of birth and postal code**. This is so Spotify can play ads that are suitable to you. You can read our Privacy Policy here.""

So I wrote:
""Your service looks great. The idea of streaming almost anything is awesome. So I wanted to sign up for Spotify, but then I read that I needed a Facebook account to sign up. I believe that Facebook is the world's single biggest privacy invasion that ever existed, and consider them criminals for (ab)using their customer's private lives.

Sorry if you guys don't want this in your subreddit, report, delete and downvote as necessary. But it's pretty annoying that ~80% of Electronic artists' work is almost impossible to discover.

***Hit the +1 below the wall of text if you want to upvote my idea.* All these reddit upvotes mean nothing-It's the GetSatisfaction page that needs to be supported.** Also, Leaving a comment reply in support on the GetSatisfaction  page also brings it closer to the top.

1313784441.0	jo7dn	Best of 2011 so far (Mostly indie &amp; alternative) [August Update]	ffffuuuuManChu	17	3	10	"** LINK:** [http://open.spotify.com/user/illkontiki/playlist/4bnxNeNoxCDclXBCm3tNpG](http://open.spotify.com/user/illkontiki/playlist/4bnxNeNoxCDclXBCm3tNpG)

First of all, sorry it took me so long to update this list now. I've got a new job and all, so I really haven't had the time I need to listen to music. Unfortunately. Well, not now, right now I'm getting sloshed on cider and beers and listening to all the fucking awesome music that has been released this year.



**So, about this update.**
*What's new with it? Well, 31 tracks, that's what. From 30 different albums and 30 different artists. It's more awesome than a foursome. And they are pretty awesome.*

For my US friends (&amp; enemies too, for that matter) a belated welcome to r/spotify!


&amp;nbsp;



**Basically, the music is indie and alt-oriented. That does not make it exclusively so, though:**

Is there electronica? Fucken' A. From glitchy, gritty shit to your chillwave bake'n'relax kind of electronica.

Is there folk? Enough to drown your whiskey-laden hearts.

Is there ambient? Yes. Yes there is. Bordering on folk, jazz and indietronica if that's how you like it. (The War on Drugs)

Is there shogaze? Are you kidding me? Of course there is.

Is there ska? Weeeel, a couple border on ska, but that's it. (Razika, Sam Duckworth)

OK, how about funky flavors? All I can say is: Check the shit out of Toro Y Moi and Jim Noir. In other words: Yes.

Is there hip hop? A small amount for credibility. (Beastie Boys)

Is there Creed? No. GTFO!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




So, how's the list sorted? 
It' usually sorted by my synesthete system. Basically by sounds or harmonies. Sometimes by voice, sometimes by genre, sometimes by how up-beat a track is. Sometimes by how I failed to sort it (look at the bottom of the list for those).

Maybe they have this and I don't know about it.

Also, how come the 'x' out button in the right corner doesn't actually close my Spotify, but rather minimizes it. If I wanted to minimize it I would hit the button for minimizing. Windows puts the X there for a reason. Use it for that purpose. (Skype I am talking to you too...)

Create a bookmark in your browser toolbar, then set the URL to this:

     javascript:location.href=location.href.replace('https://play.spotify.com/', 'spotify:').replace('/', ':')

Then when you click the bookmarklet, it will convert ""https://play.spotify.com/album"" to ""spotify:album:"" and redirect to there (or artist, or track).  (Similar to Switcheroo but you have to click it.)"	t5_2qofj	True

I love music and I love searching for new stuff that I like.

Figured why not try and maintain a playlist for people that perhaps does not have as much time as me finding new stuff.

What to expect on this playlist:

**Folk/Singer songwriters**: I love Nick Drake and I love the new wave of artists that incorporate banjos and otherwise try to take their sound back a few years.

Expect artists like: Elephant revival, Nick Drake, Ben Caplan and M.ward etc.

**Hip Hop**: One of my biggest loves in music. It is one of the best mediums to deliver good lyrics. Im very fond of storytelling in music and some hip hop artists are very good at it. I also have a preference for jazzy beats.

Expect: Atmosphere, Sage Francis, Mally &amp; the sundance kid, living legends etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Kanye west, 50 Cent... Gangster rap in general.

**Rock**: This is such a big genre it's hard to not find something you like.

What I like the most are either progressive rock or blues rock. But I also like classic rock and alternative.

Expect: Jimi Hendrix, Porcupine Tree, Black keys, Rival Sons etc.

**Electronic**: I like some electronic music but im not the biggest fan in the world. I also have a bad grasp of the subgenres here so I usually just lump them together.

Expect: The Knife, LCD Soundsystem, Caravan Palace, Phantogram etc.

Do not expect: DUBSTEP.
**
Metal**: again im not the biggest fan but there are some great artists out there.

Expect: Mastodon, High on fire, Red fang, Baroness, Opeth etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Powermetal.

**Lounge/Trip Hop/Nu jazz**: I love jazzy beats and I also like the electronic swing movement

Expect: RJD2, Bonobo, Zero 7, Waldeck, Jaga Jazzist etc.

**Blues/Jazz**: Usually I like music that is inspired by these genres but im not a puritan.

Expect: Tom waits, EsbjÃ¶rn Svensson Trio, Nina Simone, Jan Johansson etc.
**
Ska/Reggae**: Sunshine music.

Expect: Toots and the maytals, Peter Tosh, Desmond Dekker etc.

**Sort after ""added"" that way you always get the newly added songs at the top.**

Problem I was having:
I would load up spotify and all that would load up was the title bar and the button for the side menu.  I went probably over a month of just trying to uninstall and reinstall.  Never worked.  Uninstalled once more and tried deleting the spotify folder (/Android/data/com.spotify.mobile.android.ui) using OI File Manager, wouldn't work.  I was not able to delete it, kept trying installs and uninstalls, just to see if it would ""knock something loose"".  So finally, I thought to myself, well I can't delete this old folder, and haven't been able to delete it since I've had the problem... I'll try renaming it...

Remember that you need an NUS extra card, your regular student card will not qualify.

1320439826.0	m0q1i	Can you name well known artists/albums that you are missing on Spotify?		15	1	34	"I am a new user to Spotify in the Netherlands. I love the service and have upgraded to Premium right away. My apologies if this subject has already been beaten to death, but I'm wondering how many artists/albums/songs are missing on Spotify and in what regions.

So far I have (the obvious ones):

- The Beatles

- Metallica

- Bone Thugs-N-Harmony (most albums)

- Dr. Dre - The Chronic (not 2001, the old one)

- Couple of single songs, like Luchini by Camp Lo comes to mind.

This is all in the Netherlands. Wondering if these are also missing in other regions and what the reason might be. I know some artists like Metallica simply refuse to be on Spotify, but why a single song on a particular album is greyed out i have no clue. Why that 1 song?

Also in the case of the old Dr. Dre album. No clue if there is a licensing issue or it has simply been forgotten.

Any insight is appreciated!

Game consoles already have a larger install base than any streaming media exclusive player so I find it a bit odd that Spotify isn't on them. 

The main reason seems to be that it would compete with their respective music stores, but the existence if Netflix and Hulu apps may prove this theory untrue as they also both sell videos.

http://open.spotify.com/track/0KDgzTszGzPjsNtf2TktOy
http://open.spotify.com/track/3LbXPKUPANdLSxENkV0i2f

Not that interesting to look at, I know. So, here's how you do it: 

* Go to your playlist 
* Copy it all by hitting CTRL-A then CTRL-C
* Open a word processor like Google Docs, Word or whatever
* Paste the list, it should appear like this rather than urls:



&gt; Dropkick Murphys â I'm Shipping Up To Boston

&gt; Blood Red Shoes â I Wish I Was Someone Better

&gt; Neon Trees â Animal

1355956721.0	154tig	Anyone else think the most recent version of Spotify looks awful?	anagoge	25	13	14	"I've been with Spotify since quite early on, but this new update (0.8.8.295) looks awful. [A few things that look wrong](http://i.imgur.com/bvc4s.jpg):

* Having grey sidebars and white album listings just looks silly. Too much unecessary contrast. Change it back to grey. The fact that it was low contrast meant that it was easy to have it open all of the time without it being distracting. All areas under ""Collection"" including personal playlists still have a grey background which makes things even more confusing.

* If I view an album listing, the title/artist name areas are now too short to show the whole name. They were wider in the previous version.

* If I listen to a song, it's now harder to tell which song is currently playing. In the previous version, the song name and artist name were highlight green. Now it's just a small green speaker next to the track. Harder to tell at a glance.

* Biography preview area is now hidden. Usually at the top of most artist's pages. I know there's a link to it, but seeing the first paragraph at a glance was really useful.

* Personal playlists no longer show the total length of the playlist. This was really useful.

These are the four things which stick out at first glance. I'm sure there are a few other little things too, but the main one for me is the odd contrast between sidebars and main play area. PLEASE go back to grey."	t5_2qofj	True

The collection is based on my personal taste, the songs popularity that year and also (somewhat) their importance from a musical/historical perspective. There's a maximum one song, from one artist for each year.
Unfortunately neither Pink Floyd, Beatles, AC/DC or Metallica are available from Spotify at the time, otherwise they would most definitely been included.

To me, music is meant to be heard the way it was originally recorded...I don't particularly like all of the bad stuff censored out.  Do they always prefer to have the clean versions?  Additinally...is there a way to tell on the iphone mobile app if a song is explicit or not?

1368783197.0	1eibub	Why does Spotify Android client eats up my data plan when all I do is listening to downloaded playlists?	fixxxer	19	8	11	"Spotify has eaten up 541 MB since Apr 20 (so 3 days short of a month) despite the fact that I've only been listening to playlists previously downloaded on wifi. This is the primary reason for me being a Premium user - so I can download stuff in advance and then check them out on my phone while I'm out, not worrying about my data plan or shitty cell reception.

I tried using offline mode, but then Last.fm logging is offline, too, which is not what I want. This definitely shouldn't be an answer, though - why stream that stuff, offline or no offline, if it's stitting already downloaded right here on my phone? Nothing should be streamed in this case, unless the tracks get updated, or something.

This looks like a bug, especially since I haven't noticed this behaviour in previous months or at least it wasn't happening all that much previously, so I think this started with one of the latest updates.

Is there a place where we can officially submit bug reports for the Android client?"	t5_2qofj	True

I love music and I love searching for new stuff that I like. 

Figured why not try and maintain a playlist for people that perhaps does not have as much time as me finding stuff that they haven't heard before.

What to expect on this playlist:

**Folk/Singer songwriters**: I love Nick Drake and I love the new wave of artists that incorporate banjos and otherwise try to take their sound back a few years. 

Expect artists like: Elephant revival, Nick Drake, Ben Caplan and M.ward etc.

**Hip Hop**: One of my biggest loves in music. It is one of the best mediums to deliver good lyrics. Im very fond of storytelling in music and some hip hop artists are very good at it. I also have a preference for jazzy beats.

Expect: Atmosphere, Sage Francis, Mally &amp; the sundance kid, living legends etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Kanye west, 50 Cent... Gangster rap in general. 

**Rock**: This is such a big genre it's hard to not find something you like.

What I like the most are either progressive rock or blues rock. But I also like classic rock and alternative.

Expect: Jimi Hendrix, Porcupine Tree, Black keys, Rival Sons etc.


**Electronic**: I like some electronic music but im not the biggest fan in the world. I also have a bad grasp of the subgenres here so I usually just lump them together.

Expect: The Knife, LCD Soundsystem, Caravan Palace, Phantogram etc.

Do not expect: DUBSTEP.

**Metal**: again im not the biggest fan but there are some great artists out there.

Expect: Mastodon, High on fire, Red fang, Baroness, Opeth etc.

DO NOT EXPECT: Powermetal.

**Lounge/Trip Hop/Nu jazz:** I love jazzy beats and I also like the electronic swing movement

Expect: RJD2, Bonobo, Zero 7, Waldeck, Jaga Jazzist etc.

**Blues/Jazz**: Usually I like music that is inspired by these genres but im not a puritan. 

Expect: Tom waits, EsbjÃ¶rn Svensson Trio, Nina Simone, Jan Johansson etc.

**Ska/Reggae**: Sunshine music.

Expect: Toots and the maytals, Peter Tosh, Desmond Dekker etc.


I have added 100 something tunes to the playlist and Ill add a few songs a week if people show interest. It's by no means a 100 best songs I know but just 100 songs I like.

Much like Spotify, users would submit playlists, but there was an emphasis on explaining the rationale behind the list (Art of the Mix has this). This helped explain playlists with more complicated concepts and gave more context when needed.

One feature that was truly amazing was track-by-track comments. So you could essentially walk someone through your playlist. People used this to essentially tell stories punctuated by music, or share their memories of each song, or break them down musically to explain how awesome they were.

I think one of the biggest parts of sharing music with people is explaining why a song is so perfect and interpreting it. Just dumping a list of tracks on someone does not communicate that. I know Spotify employees stop by here... I think this would be a simple and elegant addition to the service.

What do you think?

It's a mix of semi-known artists and your typical top 40 stuff. I find a dusting of LMFAO or Girl Talk is a good idea to break up the playlist since people recognize the tracks and may not feel so alienated. You'll definitely feel alienated if you hate electrohouse and mashups though.

Going through it right now, it could do with another update (replacing the stale tracks with fresh ones).

Sometimes the album will be listed, but not available, sometimes there will not even be a listing for the album, and some are available right away in the morning. Most of the time, new albums are available right away on Tuesdays on services like Rdio and MOG, but Spotify seems to always lag behind and get some new albums later in the afternoon or a few days later. What gives?
 
Right now, I can listen to the new Aesop Rock on Rdio just fine. If I search for it, it doesn't show up in the actual search results, but I can see it listed in the auto-complete box if I just type ""Skelethon"" (the album title), but it tells me that it's not available. It would be really nice if they would make sure all new releases got up in a timely manner. Spotify is my music platform of choice, and I love it for the most part.

I'm Inge, the CEO and Co-Founder of Soundrop. If you're receiving this email, you are a registered user of Soundrop in Spotify. On behalf of the entire Soundrop team, I want to thank you for joining our community.
 
The team has been very busy over the past few weeks getting ready for a major update to Soundrop. We're very excited for this new version and wanted to share the news with you personally. It has some important improvements to the overall experience of using Soundrop. We think you'll really like it.
 
Here's what we've done:
 
- We fixed the ""track not available in your region"" issue. Instead of doing what Depeche Mode recommends and enjoying the silence, we now pick another track from the upcoming list to play during the time when the other, non-available track is playing. We do our best to make sure the substituted track is close to the same length.
 
- We greatly improved how you create and control your room. When you open a room, you can designate it as either ""open"", which means everyone can add tracks, or ""curated"" which means people can only vote. You control the tracks. You can also customize your room with own picture and room name, and you can tag it so others can easily find it.
 
- Speaking of finding rooms. You can also make your room discoverable by any Soundrop user. If you want to search for rooms, simply use the search field on the main Soundrop lobby to find rooms by name or tag.
 
- We improved the chat. You can now resize the chat area and also ignore users.
 
We've made a number of other improvements--some small and some big. You'll see it immediately if you get started. Look for a version number starting 1.6 in the lower right-hand corner. If you don't see it, restart Spotify. That should do the trick.
 
If you have any questions or comments, please use our Support, Twitter, or our Facebook page.
 
Thanks for being part of the Soundrop community.
 
All the best,
Inge

**Many of you already subscribe to this playlist. I now consider it as near complete as it will get in a while so consider this the last reddit update. These are what I consider to be the best tracks from 2011.**

In the past I've listed all the bands/tracks, now I won't. If you are curious, just open the list. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The playlist focuses mostly on what is considered folk and alternative rock genres. I like playful music that challenges their genre, but I also like some catchy tunes so there are a few poppy tracks that have snuck in. So there's shoegaze, ska, post-punk, screamo, folk, punk, rock, electronica, ambient, dream-pop and a bit here and there. 

There's no r'-n-b' though, and I think only one or two rap songs for some reason.


&amp;nbsp;

This playlist is can basically be a gateway (drug) into the music scene for those who haven't been religiously checking what the music press has to say about recent releases. Remember to check out the full albums of your new discoveries.


&amp;nbsp;

Thank you all for following me through the year and for the kind PM's and comments. Have a great 2012!

195 tracks from roughly 190 albums, ~11+ hours

The idea is stream of consciousness. Maybe the song you add sounds exactly like the last one; maybe it's a cover of that last song, maybe a great song by the same musician. Whatever comes to mind. Like James Joyce, but a Spotify playlist.

Rules: don't mess with the order. Add one song. Enjoy.

If you feel extra non-lazy post here why you added said track.

I'm starting with Blitzen Trapper's Destroyer of the Void. Lots of places to jump off from here.

Who's game?

Today I was looking for a particular audiobook online.  So, as an experiment, today I put ''audiobook'' into Spotify as a search.  I only found two audiobooks worth adding:  ''A Christmas Carol'' by Charles Dickens and ''The Picture of Dorian Grey'' by Oscar Wilde.  And in total I think there were less than a dozen audiobooks that came up during the search anyway.  


[But surely there must be more on Spotify?](http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=audiobooks+on+spotify&amp;qscrl=1)  According to the first article on the google search, audiobooks have been available on Spotify for almost a year.  I wonder if someone somewhere has made a text list of all the audiobooks on Spotify, or even a playlist. Spotify is pretty comprehensive, so I assume there must be tons of audiobooks on the system.

On a sidenote I am actively looking to start listening to any unabridged versions of Isaac Asimov's ''Foundation'' series as audiobooks.  They don't seem to be on Spotify but if you guys know of any where that they are streamed (no downloads please)  that would be cool.  

**TL;DR:**  Audiobooks have been available on Spotify for almost a year, but I can only find less than a dozen.  Has anyone made a text list or playlist of all the audiobooks on Spotify?  "	t5_2qofj	True

MDKAOD	12	3	4	"I have a work playlist with several hundred songs on it and I just took a glance today because I hadn't heard a few songs in a while and I discovered that there are a lot of previously playable tracks that are no longer playable. I'm wondering if this has to do with the recent update?

Examples:

Everlast - Ends (two different versions)

Everlast - What It's Like [Amended Version]

Other Everlast songs okay

The Black Crowes - She Talks to Angels

The Black Crowes - Jealous Again
(Still available, just not my versions?)

Dubstep Kings - Louder

Black Label Society, Ozzy - Stillborn

Bob Dylan - Hurricane

Slayer - Epidemic (Available, just not on my playlist)

Random Cake songs

Clutch - Electric Worry (only the live version is available?)

10 Years - The Autumn Effect (The only song unavailable, the rest of the album is fine)

Random Metallica songs unplayable on my playlist, but still available on the artist page

And others. It seems that many of the songs can be re-added but I have to notice they are missing then try and find them with the new abysmal layout of the artist pages.

Anyone have any ideas?"	t5_2qofj	True

1361552018.0	1911iq	Did i get hacked?	Vodkalasswen	11	4	3	So the problem is that i am not able to log in with my usual password and username. When i try to retrieve my password on the spotify website. I get a message from the server saying that the email adress is not connected to any active spotify account which is odd because i've been getting emails from spotify on that same email account for over a year. There's no way to contact spotify by phone and i've sent an email already but i havn't gotten an answer as of yet. Does anyone have an idea what might be going on?, ( Btw i can go in offline mode with my old password for some odd reason ).	t5_2qofj	True
