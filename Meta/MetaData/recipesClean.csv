My mom passed away a few years ago. I needed help trying to recreate a chicken recipe of hers that I have been craving, because I could only remember a few ingredients. You amazing people of r/recipes came through and gave me so many wonderful suggestions. With a mix of all your advice, I made it tonight.

I was nervous as I was putting it together. I felt like there had to be something more to it, but I went with using just the ingredients I knew (as suggested by [Ethril](http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/yhgsh/request_my_mother_passed_away_there_is_a_dish_she/c5vomaq)). I felt like there was something I was forgetting. Something about brown specks in the sauce. I went with it anyway, and figured I would know what to add at the end by taste.

I took chicken cutlets and hammered them flat. Dredged in flour and sauteed in butter (high heat). I burned the butter a little. I remembered my mom saying that butter is the one thing that is ok to burn (as long as it is not smoking furiously) so I left it alone, and smiled at the memory. I was pleased to see the chicken brown to the color I remember. When I flipped the chicken I added the zucchini spears and browned those too. When the chicken was done (just a couple minutes) I set it aside and covered it in tinfoil to keep it warm, then turned the zucchini and browned the peaches in the same pan. It only took a few minutes to brown everything and when the zucchini and peaches were done I put them aside with the chicken.

I deglazed the empty pan with chardonnay. My mom wasn't a big wine person, so I went with the cheapest they had. I suddenly remembered that sound the wine would make when it hit the hot pan, a huge hiss. Mom used to tell me to step back before she poured it in, because it would splash a little. I felt like I was nine years old again.

I added three big dollops of sour cream and dissolved it in the hot wine. I didn't know what I was going to do next, this was all I had planned. Then I saw the little brown flecks come up. It was that burned butter! I just about cried. I tasted it, and suddenly in my mind I was standing in her kitchen as a kid watching her cook. This was it. It was that simple.

I added a couple spoonfuls of the liquid from the canned peaches to take away a little of the wine's tartness, and the sauce was perfect. *Just* like she used to make.

Keep in mind that I am no food stylist, but I assure you that this tasted 10x better than it looks: http://i.imgur.com/Qgk6u.jpg

The whole thing took less than 20 minutes to make. And I fucking nailed it. Thank you so, so much reddit! You brought me back, and I love you. The smell is still lingering in the house.

I DID get it from the dental hygienist ([Pic of email](http://i.imgur.com/VuOild2.png)) but either she couldn't find the original recipe and just sent me this one or she was bullshitting the entire time.

Either way, it's awesome. I do feel a little silly though.


The [Hot Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Brown) is a dish native to the Brown Hotel in Louisville, KY.

My wife and I were traveling through, stopped there for a few days, and had the chance to try what has become my absolute favorite dish of all time.

THIS is what it looks like when you order it at the Brown Hotel: http://i.imgur.com/McQ7c.jpg

I was at the dentist last week and there was a new girl there. She mentioned she was from Louisville, I asked her if she'd ever had a Hot Brown, she said the man who invented it her been her patient years before (she was in her early 50s) and had given her the recipe! I begged for it, she sent it over, so without further ado:

Ingredients (Makes Two Hot Browns):

2 oz. whole butter

2 oz. all-purpose flour

16 oz. heavy cream

1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish

Salt &amp; pepper to taste

14 oz. sliced roasted turkey breast

2 slices of Texas toast (crusts trimmed)

4 slices of crispy bacon

2 Roma tomatoes, sliced in half

Paprika

Parsley

In a two-quart saucepan, melt butter and slowly whisk in flour until combined and a thick paste (roux) forms. Continue to cook roux for two minutes over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Whisk heavy cream into the roux and cook over medium heat until the cream begins to simmer, about 2-3 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and slowly whisk in Pecorino Romano cheese until the Mornay sauce is smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.

For each Hot Brown, place one slice of toast in an oven-safe dish and cover with 7 ounces of turkey. 

Take the two halves of Roma tomato and set them alongside the base of turkey and toast. 

Next, pour one half of the Mornay sauce to completely cover the dish. 

Sprinkle with additional Pecorino Romano cheese. 

Place entire dish under a broiler until cheese begins to brown and bubble. 

Remove from broiler, cross two pieces of crispy bacon on top, sprinkle with paprika and parsley, and serve immediately."	t5_2qh56	True

The one your family insists you bring to Sunday dinner. The one that won you that trophy at the cook-off. If it is your trademark then let's hear it!

I'll start: lilmissmoonshine's famous tzatziki!

one of those half-size tubs of plain greek yogurt (I don't remember the ounces, 16 I think)

2 tablespoons of mayo (I use the olive-oil based kind, mayo is optional but it adds thickness to your sauce and you really can't tell that it's there)

1 large cucumber

a half handful of FRESH dill weed

a half handful of FRESH mint leaves

4-5 garlic cloves

about a half teaspoon of garlic powder (this is the ""secret"" ingredient I think, garlic powder adds another flavor dimension that you can't get from fresh garlic)

about a half teaspoon of lemon juice

salt to taste

Basically just scrape the watery seedy center out of the cucumber and either throw away or set aside - i like to have it in a glass of chilled water - and then blend all of the ingredients together in no particular order. You can peel the cucumber if you want, I usually peel about half of it and leave the rest in the sauce because I think that makes for the prettiest shade of green. In my house tzatziki usually initially gets made for falafel night, and then gets put on everything from strawberries to sandwiches until it's used up.

1363307549.0	1abjgv	Grilled Cheese - A beginners guide	Googunk	315	95	114	"Eventually it is expected that you will make your own bread, cheese, and tomato soup.  For now, this guide assumes your stock is store-bought.

When I was 4 through 10 years old, my favorite lunch was a grilled cheese sandwich how my dad made them.  White bread, American cheese singles, slathered in mayonnaise, cooked dry on the George foreman or nearly deep fried in canola oil.  Dipping that into plain campbell's tomato remains a vivid memory for me.  But I'm a big boy now, and I deserve a big boy sandwich.  It's time to lose the wonderbread, the partially hydrogenated cheese simulant, and the can of red food coloring in sour water.  Today we drop artificial ingredients and learn how to make this childhood favorite into something that even people with bank accounts will salivate over.

A few disclaimers: The first set of instructions are not a recipe.  They are tips to make your own perfect grilled cheese, as there are thousands of ways to combine ingredients. This is a beginner's guide, but when I say beginner's, I mean that it is not difficult.  It can still be complicated.  Towards the end, you will find my personal recipe, which is admittedly complicated and time consuming .  The recipe is intermediate level, but only because it contains caramelized onions.  All other elements are something even a first timer can handle.  However, my recipe is not the best recipe, there is no such thing.  Everyone has their own favorite, and the first half of this post is guidelines with which you can design your own sandwich, which can be any difficulty level you choose.  In short, this is not blueprints to build a house, it is an architecture 101 textbook segment.

**GUIDE TO GRILLED CHEESE**

**BREAD:** Something light and airy with a hearty crust.  Are you 8 years old? No? Then leave the damn crust on.  My preference is sourdough diamante, sliced about 1/2 inch thick.  Slice it fresh for optimum moisture of bread.  Don't let the store slice it unless you are using it same day.

**FAT:** The essential rule is that the fat be solid at room temperature.  To most simple kitchens this means butter, preferably salted.  You can add salt to unsalted butter to make it salted butter, its not rocket science.  You can add salt to salted butter for double salted butter to commit suicide.  Be sure to butter the exterior of the bread, do not butter the pan.  You can look into other fats later, but if you don't know what you are doing, butter has the best quality:difficulty ratio.

**PAN:** don't use something bowl shaped, the whole face of the bread needs to rest on a flat surface so use a skillet or a griddle.  A non-stick pan is a very good idea.  Green pans live up to the hype in my opinion.  Try to get the pan on a burner about the same diameter as the pan to promote even heating.  I know it's called grilled cheese, but that is a misnomer in most cases.  We are frying the sandwich, which is a much better application for these ingredients.  I know it's an easy fallacy to succumb to, but retired boxers don't know much about home cooking appliances and should not be taken at their word.  That particular contraption has some uses, but this is not one of them, so keep your grilled cheese on the stovetop.

**CHEESE:** The only wrong answer is one.  I am a cheese polygamist.  A single cheese is boring and I don't believe any one cheese embodies all the factors you desire from your sandwich.  My preference is equal parts medium cheddar and fresh mozzarella (the kind packed in water, very different from melting moz!!) and a bit of asiago, romano, and/or parmesean.  The key is one flavorful cheese, one melty cheese, and a pinch of stinky cheese.  Please do not use Velveeta, american cheese, and anything that has to explicitly state it is a ""food product"" on the label.  They are not cheese.  If you prefer these products to actual cheese, then your opinion is incorrect.

**FILLINGS:** There is room for more than just cheese.  Only the stuffiest of purists would say otherwise.  I like whole basil leaves and caramelized onions.  Only thing you can do wrong is put something crunchy inside the sandwich.  The grilled bread is your crunch, the inside is your gooey flavor.  I caramelize the onions because crunchy onions just aren't right.  Don't stop at veg.  My wife is a vegetarian and so that means I am too most of the time.  Those without such limitations can incorporate bacon, ham, and other flesh candy.  Remember to keep these soft or in the case of bacon least brittle enough to bite through easily.

**SOUP:** Not required, but if you skip the soup, put sun dried tomato as a filling in the sandwich.  Your canned, boxed, or *shudder* concentrated tomato soup tastes like shit.  Add red pepper flakes, fresh rosemary, and fresh basil leaves cut julienne.  Can sub in dried rosemary, but leave your dried basil in the pantry where it belongs.  Dipping the sandwich in the soup is optional.  I enjoy a gentleman's dip now and again myself.

Why is tomato a necessity?  Think pizza.  Tomato sauce, bread, melted cheese, toppings - Sounds like tomato soup, bread melted cheese, and fillings to me.  I think everyone can agree that pizza's flavors are perfect, so that's what we're making here.  It's a fried cheese pizza sandwich with dipping soup.  Without tomato sauce, pizza would be cheezy bread.  You know what people do with cheezy bread?  Dip it in marinara sauce because someone didn't have the foresight to put some tomato sauce on it!

**COOKING:** Golden. Brown.  No black.  Little if any white.  Should be easy to achieve with buttered sourdough.  Turn after 1 or 1 1/2 minutes or so on each side, then more and more frequently and cooking progresses.  This helps the heat permeate to the center.  If the outside burned or your cheese isn't melted when the bread is golden brown then you have cut your bread too thick.  Either overcook the exterior :'(, commit sepukku, or try again.  The most common problem cooks report is that the cheese isn't melting.  This is because the heat isn't reaching the center of the sandwich.  Either use thinner bread, turn down the heat (make sure it stays at frying temp!), or cover the pan for the first half of cooking.  Do not cover for the second half of cooking, covering traps heat but also traps moisture and if you leave the lid on the result may be a steamed cheese sandwich instead.  The soup should be steaming, but not boiling.

**EATING:** If anyone is watching: cut the sandwich in half, and separate enough that a strand of melted cheese still bridges the two halves for perfect plating. This size is easier to handle and will help you to keep the contents contained.  If you choose to dip, dip the non-crusted side first.  If nobody is watching, put a tarp or plate down on the floor to protect your carpet and then try to put as much of the sandwich in your mouth as will fit at one time.  Reverse blow to cool the contents in your mouth.  Don't chew, just disintegrate the ingredients by hydrating them with spit and sucking the essence away.  The flavor does not stop.

**REVIEW:** Rustic bread, sliced fresh.  1 smooth melty cheese, 1 happy flavorful cheese, 1 little bit of stinky hard cheese.  Other fillings should be soft.  Involve tomato somehow.  Apply fat to the bread, not the pan.  Use a fat which is solid at room temperature such as butter.  Use a flat pan on a burner close to the same diameter as the pan. Soup is optional, but get the tomato from another source if the soup is skipped.  Aromatic Italian herbs optional in the soup or sandwich.  Heat should be medium, just high enough to fry that butter.  Flip the sandwich infrequently to start, and then flip more and more frequently as cooking progresses.  Cook it to golden brown like medium toast.  If you see black bread, stop.  Cut it in half or else cheese gets in your lap.

You really want a recipe huh?  Subreddit title and all that?  Well OK, but remember that asking for one recipe for grilled cheese is like asking for one recipe for chicken.  Here's my personal preferences as far as store bought can achieve in one easy recipe:


**""Googunk's amazing grilled cheese which is guaranteed to gain you respect, admiration, and/or sex from whomever you serve it to, even yourself. - Recipe makes 4 sandwichgasms""**

-1 loaf rosemary or sourdough diamante, sliced to 1/2 inch.  Use the centermost 8 slices.

-at least 2 tbs salted butter

-4 oz medium cheddar cheese

-4 oz fresh mozzarella

-1/2 oz graded or shaved Parmesan cheese or hard cheese blend

-1 white onion

-12 leaves fresh basil

-1 sprig fresh rosemary.

-1 can or box tomato soup

If you didn't have anything on the list in your fridge already and buy everything you need, the total cost of ingredients will be about $8.  The most expensive part is the bread at $3ish, if you have a bread machine, this is easily reduced to $0.25.  If you make your own mozzarella and soup, keep a basil plant in the house and a rosemary bush outside, this can cost as little as $3.

Prepare fresh mozzarella by patting dry with no-lint towel, then placing in a colander and leaving uncovered in fridge for at least 3 hours to dry further.  

In 1st pan, caramelize the onions.  I try to make no assumptions as to your skill as a chef but this step can be tricky if its your first run, so look it up online if you aren't comfortable with this step.  Remember that low and slow in the name of game when it comes to caramelizing onions.

In 2nd pan, heat tomato soup and add 4 basil leaves, julienned or diced, and add Italian seasoning to taste.  Be aware that fresh basil flavor will increase when warmed.  Heat to steaming, but do not allow soup to boil.  

In 3rd pan, skillet, or griddle - heat to medium.  

Butter one side of each slice of bread.  Between 2 slices of bread, buttered side out, layer equal portions of cheese on each slice, add 1/4 of caramelized onions and 2 basil leaves to the center of each sandwich.  

One at a time, place sandwich on pan.  You should hear a sizzle.  Wait 90 seconds and turn, wait another 90 seconds and turn again, repeat with gradually shorter increments until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown.

Cut in half, serve hot.  Pair with delicate white wine such as pinot grigio or chardonnay. Or beer, whatever, do whatever what you want.

He who controls the grilled cheese controls the universe.

Ill start...	scornflake	277	54	248	Prosciutto Pizza has only 4 ingredients if youre willing to use store bought pizza dough. You will also need an onion, fresh mozzarella, and thinly sliced prosciutto. Thinly slice and caramelize one onion in butter (maybe butter makes it 5 ingredients?) Flatten pizza dough in a rough rectangle on a baking sheet and poke all over with a fork. Bake dough at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, then remove from oven. Spread caramelized onions and cubed or sliced mozzarella on top of the partially baked pizza dough, then just drape slices of prosciutto over all. Return to oven for 10-13 minutes, til dough is browned and prosciutto is beginning to crisp. This has been a very popular recipe in my house, I hope you'll try it :)	t5_2qh56	True

burned it into my memory at the age of 15 and I present it to you

Best served with meat of some kind (we are using chicken today)

Ok people, listen up cause here is what you’re gonna need.

DEVIL SAUCE (with Chicken)

Ingredients.

2 tablespoons of  Yellow Mustard powder - - Example http://imgur.com/0oOIlzy

2 tablespoons of Curry Powder - Example http://imgur.com/y7urlfq

2 cups of Tomato sauce - This means Ketchup in the U.S!

2 large onions, diced

2 lemons, both for zest &amp; juice

2-4 large chicken breasts – sliced butterfly style so it looks like this - 

http://imgur.com/IFDtPcx

A little bit of oil to brown the chicken in

Method

In a frypan, brown the chicken off, then place in an oven pan. I have a nice large glass/pyrex one that I use - http://imgur.com/wisJQa4

When all the chicken is browned, give the pan a quick wipe to get rid of most of the oil, then add the mustard &amp; curry powder.

Fry the 2 powders together for a minute or so (it won’t take long) then add the onion to the pan.

Fry the onion for a couple minutes, stir it around so it gets coated in the powders then add the tomato sauce. Stir for a couple more minutes then add the zest of 1-2 lemons and the juice of 1-2 lemons. (try one first &amp; TASTE – add more if you want)

Turn the pan down to a simmer &amp; simmer that all together for around 10 minutes – stir every minute.

Pour the sauce over the chicken – cover in tinfoil / aluminium foil and cook in the oven for 90 minutes at 180c (355f)

Serve however you like. The beauty of this recipe is that it can be changed in so many ways.

Use any meat

Serve with rice or pasta or vegetables – whatever you like.

Notes on the sauce:

If you slightly increase or decrease the level of any one ingredient, you change the sauce.

1 lemon vs 2 for extra tangy

An extra teaspoon of either powder

No onion (maybe you are alergic)

Ive googled for pics of my Dad’s sauce and trawled through hundreds of photos, nothing I have seen looks quite right.

Thankyou for reading &amp; I really hope you enjoy this as much as I do.

My girlfriend and I were at home one evening sitting at the table thinking of what to do for dinner, we didn't really have anything particular to make and began rummaging through the fridge to see if we could come up with something, she likes to cook things by the book and follow recipes to a tea, I however am much more inclined to making things up on the fly and generally they turn out pretty good and since we didn't have any recipes for what we currently had in the house, she let me handle it. This is what I came up with. (this recipe has since been perfected)

**~The Absolute Most Amazing Soup In Existence~**

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8MmyXBc.jpg) is a picture of the Soup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**THINGS YOU WILL NEED**

*Base Ingredients*

*Organic Chicken Stock (I think like half a quart? Idk it looks like [this](http://www.chow.com/blog-media/2011/04/costco_chicken_stock.jpg))

*Some Whole Milk, or Half &amp; Half (if lactose intolerant this recipe isn't for you)

*A [large cast iron pot](http://i.imgur.com/gwWtQgu.jpg) 

*A [large cast iron skillet](http://i.imgur.com/jHsA6tG.jpg) (for THE MEATS)

===================

*VEGGIES*

*Carrots (about 4 or 5 cut longways and then in half again, not the round little bastards)

*Kale ([here](http://i.imgur.com/1zkebOJ.jpg) if you don't know what kale looks like, kale....kale.)

*Potatoes (yukon gold or red)

*Leeks! (2 maybe one if it's large...like your mom)

*Some Shallots

*Some Onions (any kind will do, wear swimming goggles while cutting if you cry like a bitch like I do)

*A fucking Jalapeno, 2 if you're a badass (handle with care before handling your penis.)

*Anaheim Chili Peppers (2)

*A clove of vampire repellant (also helps to keep [this](http://i.imgur.com/pBOb9tM.jpg) douche away)

====================

*THE MEAT*

*HALF A FUCKING POUND OF [THICK ASS PEPPER BACON](http://i.imgur.com/rFUHE4c.jpg)(I actually googled ""thick ass pepper bacon"" and that's the pic that came up, thanks google)

*4-pack of Andouille Sausage (http://i.imgur.com/W93UXmP.jpg)

====================

*FLAVOR MAKERS*

*1 pack of Mediterranean Flavor Feta Cheese (http://i.imgur.com/ymyrd73.jpg)

*[Salt &amp; Peppa](http://i.imgur.com/WJ8jmxd.jpg)

*Bacon drippings (I just wanted you to know that I felt old when typing that)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**THE PROCESS**

*I'm not going to go into full detail how everything should be chopped up and sliced, just cut everything into the sizes that you find most appropriate, also there's a fucking picture of it up there ^*


*1. Start by cooking the THICK ASS PEPPER BACON and the Andouille sausages in the skillet.

*2. Sautee(&lt;-sp? fuck it.) the Leeks, Shallots, Onions, Kale, Jalapeno/s, Chilis and Douche Repellent with the Butter in the large cast iron pot for about 10 minutes, about half way through pour some of the grease from the bacon and sausage into the pot, you know, for flavor.

*3. Pour the entire contents of the Chicken Stock into the pot, add the Carrots and Potatoes and wait for it to start boiling. (don't forget to stir it every now and then)

*4. Cut up the Bacon and Sausage and add them to the pot, reduce heat and let simmer for 5 mins.

*5. Add about a half cup of the Half &amp; Half or a whole cup of the milk, add the Feta Cheese.

*6. Bring to a boil then immediately reduce heat and let simmer for 10 minutes.

*7. Check to see if the Potatoes &amp; Carrots are cooked fully, if so proceed to step 8.

*8. Eat until you pass out.

After awhile we all got pretty sick of the plain boiled or even grilled dogs. So my father went looking for a better way to prepare them so my sister and I would actually eat them instead of feeding them to the pup we had. For years, this was the ONLY way I would eat them. Daddy passed away in Dec. of 2009 but I'm sure he would not mind my sharing this with everyone.

Ingredients:

1 package Hot Dogs (any variety should do)

1/4 cup water

1/2 cup ketchup 

1 Tblsp. Brown Vinegar (I discovered it's Apple Cider vinegar)

1 Tblsp. Brown Sugar (light is used here but dark works)

1 tsp. Seasoned Salt

1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce (He used a Tblsp. Adjust to taste)

1/8 tsp. Chili powder

1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped Onion 

1-2 Tblsp. Margarine

1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder 

Mix all ingredients except onion and margarine. Set aside.
Melt margarine in a skillet. Add onions and saute for a few minutes. 
Add the hot dogs and roll 'em around for a minute or two.
Pour the sauce mix over the hot dogs.
Simmer for 10-20 minutes. 

Serves 4-8.

Variations: If you don't have onion you can use 2 Tblsp. dry onion in the seasoning aisle OR use 1-2 tsp onion powder.

You can also mince 2 cloves of garlic and add that to the onion and margarine and not the sauce mix. 

To make the sauce thicker, use a little less water. Thinner sauce, use a little more water. 

Suggestion:  DOUBLE the sauce mix. I haven't found anyone who doesn't like this recipe yet and he always doubled this for the extra sauce that makes these so yummy.

6 ounces (170g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped

5 ounces (140g) milk chocolate, chopped (use one that’s at least 30% cacao solids)

Directions:

Spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast the nuts in a 350ºF (180ºC) oven, stirring a few times, for 10 to 15 minutes, until the hazelnuts are browned.

While they are roasting, warm the whole milk and powdered milk in a small saucepan with the honey and salt just until it starts to boil. Remove from heat.

In a clean, dry bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt the chocolates together until smooth.

Once the nuts are well-toasted, remove them from oven and use a spatula to place the warm hazelnuts in a clean tea towel, then fold them inside the towel and rub them vigorously to remove any loose skins.

In a food processor, grind the warm hazelnuts until they’re as fine as possible. 

Add the melted chocolate and continue to process the mixture, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, as necessary.

Once the mixture is smooth, add the warm milk mixture and process until everything is well-combined.

(Optional) Strain the paste if you mind the little bits of nuts.

Transfer the mixture into two jars and refrigerate until ready to use."	t5_2qh56	True

I thought I would share it here.

\________________________________________

 **Equipment Needed**

* Grill pan 
* (1) Gallon sized Ziploc bag
* Small food processor (I use a Ninja Chopper)

\________________________________________


##Chipotle Chicken and Marinade
* 4 Boneless/Skinless Chicken Breasts (or 6 boneless/skinless chicken thighs [Chipotle uses thighs, I use breasts since it's healthier and it tastes the same to me])
* 2 Small Cans of *Embasa Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce*. (use only 5 of the actual peppers - total, and ALL of the sauce you can get from the cans, disgard the rest of the peppers unless you like them.)
* 1 Tbsp of Cumin
* 2 Tsp of Oregano
* 1/2 cup of water
* 1 Tsp of Honey
* 2 Tbsp of Olive Oil
* 2 Cloves of Garlic
* a few 'turns' of fresh ground pepper.

**Marinade Instructions**

* Blend all the the marinade ingredients in the food processor until everything is blended well. 
* Put the marinade and the chicken in the ziploc bag and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour (overnight would be best)

**Cooking Instructions**

* Add a little non-stick cooking spray to Grill Pan and preheat it on Medium High heat.  You want it to be really hot because you want to char grill marks into the chicken.
* Place chicken on the grill pan, let it sear/char well before turning it,  and cook until almost done.
* Reduce heat to medium and Remove the chicken to a plate,  cut into small chunks and place back into the pan. Cook a little longer until the chicken is completely done.
* Wrap all the done chicken tightly in foil and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before eating.
**Tip: Cook the fajita veggies in this pan while it's still hot for better flavor.**

\________________________________________

##Fajita Veggies

* 1 Red Onion, sliced into strips
* 1 Green Pepper (red is tasty too!), sliced into strips
* 1 Tsp of Dried Oregano
* Canola Spray

**Cooking Instructions**

* Place veggies and oregano in very hot pan and spray with a little canola oil.
* Saute until done, but the veggies should still be 'crispy'

\________________________________________

##Cilantro-Lime Rice

* (2) - 2 Cup bags of Uncle Ben's Whole Grain Boil-in-Bag Rice [a box has 4 bags in it]
* Juice from 1 Lime
* 1 - small bunch of fresh cilantro (stems removed, leafs finely chopped)
* 1 1/2 Tbsp of butter
* Kosher Salt (or sea salt)

**Cooking Instructions**

* Cook rice according to instructions and mix well with other ingredients (soften the butter a little bit to make mixing easier).
* Add salt to taste

\________________________________________ 

##Black Beans

* 1 can of Black Beans (undrained)
* 2 tsp of cumin
* 1 tsp of oregano
* 1 tsp of kosher salt

**Cooking Instructions**

Mix all the ingredients in a small sauce pan and heat thoroughly. 

\________________________________________

Put all the prepared ingredients in a warmed flour tortilla and enjoy."	t5_2qh56	True

1345050949.0	y9qdi	I worked at a Jamie Oliver restaurant. This is my favorite recipe from my time there; Sicilian Caponata	JRC87	195	31	41	"Caponata 

Takes about an hour, but totally worth it.

Soffrito of 1 Onion, 1 medium leek and 1 large carrot. Diced as finely as you possibly can. 

Dried oregano or majoram

2 Aubergines 

Tomato paste

Red wine

Pine nuts about 100g (if you are feeling wealthy)

2 tins tomatoes or 1 tin and a couple of handfuls of cherry toms. 

Red wine vinegar

Tbsp of coco powder

Handful of good olives sliced in half.

Ok, now seriously,  fuck traditional recipes.

Set oven to 160oc and put the cherry toms in. You can forget about them, nothing can go wrong at 160oc 

Whenever you get close to the end of chopping the soffrito up get your best heavy based pan on a medium heat with a good amount of pommace or veg oil. 
By the time the oil is hot you should have finished chopping, get the veg in with a large amount of oregano. Put in more than you think, it will get very diluted later. 
Let this sweat away, it can stay on for about 30-40 mins until its really soft.

Now get a couple of plates or a tray and line it with a few layers of kitchen roll. Next get a good sized frying pan on one of the front hot plates (you need to reach it easily). 
Get it on high. Cut the aubergines into about 2cm cubes, quite chunky. By the time you've done that the pan should be nice and toasty. Add a lot, I mean a lot, of pommace oil. Aubergines drink oil like the Irish drink Guinness. Tilt the pan around to coat then get in as many of the cubes as you can, until they won't touch the base. You'll probably need to do 2-3 rounds. Fry until nearly burned, to golden bordering black. Should take 4-5mins if you've got the skillz, you can do this; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noizuQwvL0M . Otherwise use a spatula to flip it so its evenly coloured, the aubergine will have halved in size by the end. Discard onto paper. Repeat. 

Check the tomatoes in the oven, they should be getting soft, but probably are not quite done yet. Crank it to 180.
By the time you've finished frying, the soffrito should be smelling damn lovely. Check its done by chewing a bit of carrot, if it still has a lot of crunch to it, you are not on the road to the land of Caponata yet... If happy, turn the heat up and add a couple of tbsps of tomato paste. 'Cook out' for a few minutes until you can smell the tomato and it coats everything. When its really steaming, de-glaze the pan by pouring in about a quarter of a bottle wine, it should hiss like an angry cobra in a trap. Bring to the boil and reduce by about half. 

While its doing that, you can get out the tomatoes out the oven and put in the pine nuts, time 10 minutes. At £20 per kilo, pine nuts are a bitch to burn. 
 
Once reduced you can add in the tinned tomatoes and turn the heat down to medium again. Go and watch TV. 

After about half an hour you can introduce the tomatoes, aubergine, olives and coco powder. They will need about 10 minutes to properly mingle and become good friends. 

Shit, the pine nuts! Nah, I'm sure you remembered those. Get them in with a tbsp of red wine vinegar and a good glug of decent olive oil. 

Taste, stir and season. Taste again.  I cannot stress how much I get yelled at when I don't put salt and pepper in/on things. 

You have made Caponata. You now have the tools to go conquer the earth, just like the Romans.

RainbowYawn	179	26	25	"The ingredients are approximated, because hell, that's how my grandma did it for years. 

Mary’s Grandma-inspired Chicken Soup


Broth:

6 bone-in chicken breasts

a large pot, half-full of water

salt, to taste

a palmful of bay leaves

a palmful of peppercorns


Soup:

half a bag of carrots, peeled and cut thick

half a bag of celery, separate leaves and halve stalks

an onion, quartered or sliced thick

a few cloves of garlic, quartered

half a bouquet of parsley, a tablespoon chopped fine and the rest left whole

half a bouquet of fresh dill, a tablespoon chopped and the rest left whole

A bag of fine egg noodles


1.	Salt the water, when boiling, add rinsed chicken breasts and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add bay leaves and peppercorns. Return to a slow boil for 20 minutes.

2.	Add carrots, celery, onions, and garlic. Return to a slow boil, turn down to simmer for 20 minutes. 

3.	Add parsley and dill. Simmer for 20 minutes. 


The bayleaves and peppercorns can be made into a cheesecloth sachet to be removed if you don’t want them in your soup. You can do the same with the whole dill and parsley and remove after cooking. The chopped parsley and dill are for presentation. 


You can also remove the breasts to a cutting board and remove the bones once the soup is finished cooking. Cut up the meat for a good texture. 


The egg noodles can not be cooked into the soup, they lose their texture. You can boil them separate and store them in the fridge and add them to each bowl of soup per serving. 
This soup is great for an upcoming busy week and delicious in the winter.

* Get some hamburger meat.
* Throw it in a bowl.
* Throw in some Worcestershire Sauce.
* Throw in some Soy Sauce. Just a little bit.
* Throw in your favorite steak rub.
* Get your fingers in that cow flesh and massage, baby!
* (I also felt crazy and put in a little hot sauce and BBQ sauce)
* Make your patties.
* Cut them in half.
* Put a big clump of Bleu Cheese in the middle.
* Close that pattie up.
* Seal the deal by sentencing those patties to burn, you arsonist!
* Cook for your desired length! (Rare like Rambo!)
* And enjoy! (Like you had a choice...)

Can someone help me figure out how to reproduce it?	outfoxedagain	183	37	29	"I am a pretty competent cook, so don't worry about that bit. I just want to know if this dish sounds familiar, so someone can fill me in on the parts I don't remember.

It's a chicken dish made with flat chicken cutlets. I think she used to hammer them a bit with a kitchen mallet, dredge them in flour, and pan fry them in a little butter so they would brown nicely.

The sauce is the part I am a little lost about. She used white wine (probably chardonnay) and sour cream, that part I am sure of. There were canned peaches too, which were slightly browned and served on top. I'm sure there was something more to it than that, any thoughts?

The flavor was tangy, not particularly sweet except for the peaches, and the sauce was opaque and kind of a beige color. Does this sound like a dish you are aware of? While her food was great, her dishes were usually pretty simple. It is likely that this is not something she invented herself, but it might be something that she simplified. Does anyone know what this is or what it is called so I can look it up and try and get it right?

She used to serve it with grilled zucchini brushed with garlic butter.

Thank you.

**Edit** -- I am blown away with how helpful and kind you all have been. I have taken little hints from each of your posts and a lot of them have jogged my memory. I think some sort of composite from these suggestions will produce something close. I am going to try to make it when I have the chance, and I will update when I do. Thank you, reddit. &lt;3

Get out the crockpot and get your Chili on:

Here is our recipe (which won our family Chili cook-off out of about 6 entries):

**Grocery List**

* 2 Big Cans Whole Tomatoes
* 2 lbs Ground Beef
* 1 Yellow Onion
* 1 Red Pepper
* 1 Medium Can Pinto Beans
* 1 Medium Can Light Red Kidney Beans
* 1 Tablespoon Minced Garlic
* 4 Tablespoons Chili Powder
* 1/2 Tablespoon Cumin (if you like Cumin, full Tablespoon)
* 3 Teaspoons Salt
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper
* 1 Tablespoon Rustic Italian Seasoning
* 2 Teaspoons Red Pepper
* Dash of Red Pepper Flakes
* Dash of Hot Sauce (or more, up to you)

**Instructions**

*Brown your meat. Dice your onion. Cut your Red Pepper into cubes.*

*Pour in your cans of whole tomatoes, use a spatula and cut your tomatoes into large chunks/cubes. Add meat, onion, and red pepper. Drain your cans of beans and pour them into the pot. Mix. Add seasonings, garlic, and hot sauce. Mix. Set cook time to low for 8-10 hours.*

*Dish it out. Goes well with a touch of sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese, and whatever else you put in your chili when you chow down.*

**Baked Potato Soup**

4 baked potatoes

2/3  cup margarine

2/3 cup flour

6 cups milk (I substituted 2 cups of the milk for chicken stock and no one could tell.)

bacon, cooked and crumbled (12 slices)

green onions, chopped (4)

cheddar cheese, shredded (1-1/4 cup)

1 cup sour cream. 

Salt/pepper (optional)

Melt butter in your soup pot. Add flour, cook and stir until smooth. Gradually add milk/broth. Cook over medium heat until thickened. Scoop pulp out of baked potatoes and add. Add salt and pepper (if using), some green onion, a bunch of bacon and some cheese. Cook until thoroughly heated. Stir in sour cream. Serve topped with extra cheese, green onion and bacon. (* The recipe is fairly flexible. I’ve put the real recipe’s suggested amounts of bacon, onions and cheese in brackets there, but I find 4 green onions is too many, 12 slices of bacon is too expensive and that amount of cheese is definitely not enough for us. Use whatever works for you.)

"	istara	157	22	52	"This is just insanely easy.  Plus you can alter the ingredient quantities and it really won't matter much.

**Crockpot peanut chicken**

 - 500g (ish) of chicken breast (or thigh meat) cut in big chunks
 - 1 jar/1 cup of salsa (as mild or as spicy as you like)
 - approx half a cup of peanut butter (I used unsweetened crunchy)
 - 1tbsp of lime juice/or half a lime squeezed
 - 1tbsp of soy sauce
 - 1-2 tsps freshly grated ginger
 - Optional: freshly chopped coriander

1.  Put the chicken in the slow cooker

2.  Mix up all the other ingredients

3.  Pour it on the chicken, mix it around a little so it's all covered

4.  Cook on slow for around six-eight hours

5.  Serve with freshly chopped coriander


The resulting dish is really thick and tasty, there's no watery excess of sauce such that you often get with slow cooked things.  In fact the chicken seems to continue absorbing any extra moisture even after you take it out.  

This also goes fine in the fridge for a day or so afterwards, I reheated the leftovers on the stovetop over low heat with a splash of water added, since I don't have a microwave."	t5_2qh56	True

Gotta branch out!). I want to start thinking about what to invest in now so I can spread out the cost of buying the non-perishable things and thinking about what perishables to explore. For recipes, quick dishes involving as few pots/pans/dishes as possible is best because our kitchen and sink area is so tiny.

**Spices/sauces I have**: soy sauce, black vinegar, rice wine, oyster sauce, sriracha, garlic chili, red pepper flakes, salt &amp; pepper. 

**Staples I already kept around**: Rice, pasta, eggs, garlic, onions, ginger, potato starch, scallions, flour, olive oil, butter. I always have a few types of fresh veggies (usu. broccoli, red peppers, bok choy, nappa cabbage, etc.) and meat (chicken breasts, pork bones, beef, pork) or silken tofu, though I'd love to branch out with the produce/protein I buy.

**Cookware I already own**: knife set, medium sized skillet, medium and large pot, metal baking trays. My dorm has a stove, a microwave, a toaster oven, a blender, an oven and a fridge/freezer. 

I'm already considering investing in a small crockpot for when I may not have time to actively cook. A lot of the sauces, spices and cookware end up being communal so I'm sure my suitemates will also appreciate your input.

2/3 cup salted butter

1 1/2 cups sugar

1/4 cup brandy

4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

4 eggs

2 tablespoons cinnamon

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon table salt

Coarse sea salt, to taste

**Directions**

In a saucepan, bring the butter, sugar and brandy to a boil, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir (with a wooden spoon) in 2 cups of chocolate chips until melted. Remember to give that spoon a lick! Cool mixture slightly. Stir in vanilla. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add the chocolate mixture and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, then gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture. Stir in any remaining chocolate chips. Spread into a greased baking pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 35-45 minutes or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean. Careful not to burn your balls! Let cool just enough that it won't burn your hands. Meanwhile set up a small plate or cutting board with some of the sea salt on it. Scrape up the brownie mix, working around the edges. You don't want to use the hard edges for the balls. Begin shaping 1″ balls out of the mix, give or take in size. Roll the balls in the salt. Do this very lightly (I suggest you do NOT try to emulate the picture), a little sea salt goes a very long way. If you do happen to oversalt, just brush the excess salt crystals off. Too much salt is bad, mmmkay? You're done, put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em!

Learned this recipe from my old girlfriend's grandmother - she was even more liberal with whatever she happen to have.

People always LOVE this rice, and it keeps for several days.  If you like more PLAIN rice, this is not for you.  I like my rice to be full of flavor and be a main part of the meal, not just an afterthought to fill up the plate.


Please take note, that these ingredients and amounts are all 'to taste', and feel free to adjust accordingly.


You can double/triple/etc this recipe.  I usually do a minimum of 2 cups, but my pan fits 3 almost perfectly.  Biggest I've done is 5 cups, but I would rather do 2 smaller batches, as I did it in a pot instead of a pan.


1 Cup short grain rice

1/4 cup butter

1/2 ~Medium onion (I love onion, so I often 'round up')

~2 Garlic Cloves (I buy the already cut up stuff, and usually just shake roughly a tablespoon worth in).

~1 1/2 teaspoon Pepper

~1 1/2 teaspoon Salt (I usually use Kosher, because that is what we have)

2 Cups Chicken Broth  (This will actually go DOWN if you have more rice, if I were doing 3 cups rice, I would probably only do ~5 cups chicken broth).

1/2 small can of tomato SAUCE (not  paste!)  I usually just use 1 full can for 2 cups of rice.

1/2 Bunch of Cilantro.  You can also use that pre-cut tube you find near the same section, it works in a pinch, but fresh is better.


The beauty of this 'recipe', is who cares what you put in or how much?!  If you like more cilantro, throw more in there.  The basics are all the same.

1.  Melt Butter in pan, then add rice and get it evenly coated with the butter.  Brown somewhat heavily (see step 2 before you finish), should see most of it 'golden' brown, and some darker.  This requires some attention as depending on your stove it can burn easy.  (If it is not browning within ~5 minutes, add a bit more butter).

2.  Once you judge the rice is about 'half' done browning, throw in the garlic, onions, salt and pepper.

3. When all finished browning, add chicken broth, tomato sauce and cilantro (my wife goes through the pain in the butt process of removing all the leaves, then dicing it...  I just cut off the majority of the stem, and do a semi-fine chop).

4. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes.

* 1 lb. cavatelli pasta, cooked as directed on the box
* 8 oz extra sharp cheddar, shredded
* 8 oz pepperjack, shredded
* salt &amp; pepper
* 1/8 tsp. garlic powder
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3 1/2 tbsp flour
* 1 1/2 cup milk
* 1 broccoli crown
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 onion, diced  
* 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken, cut into small strips 


Start by getting the broccoli &amp; chicken part cooked.  I also boiled the pasta while getting this part done. The cheese sauce requires the most attention, so you don't want to be working on other parts of the recipe while making the cheese sauce.


So first, heat up a large skillet pan with oil, add garlic.   Saute for one minute, then add onion, and cook until translucent.  Add chicken.  I used chicken thigh meat because it was on sale, but if you prefer white meat, you can use that too.  I actually love dark meat and its rich flavor.  Cook on medium-high heat until browned, about five minutes, stirring occasionally.


Add the broccoli on top, cover immediately.  You do not need to stir, the steam from the chicken and onions should cook the broccoli to the proper tenderness.  Cook until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender, about 5 minutes.  Turn off heat, but keep cover on to retain heat.


Now on to that cheese sauce.  Start by warming a saucepan on medium heat.  Add butter but watch carefully so the butter does not burn.  Add the flour and whisk constantly for 2 minutes.  Slowly add the milk very gradually, whisking constantly.


Simmer and let thicken, whisking frequently for about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and immediately add cheeses, salt &amp; pepper, and garlic powder.  Stir until incorporated.  In the pasta pot, add chicken and broccoli mixture to the pasta.  Pour cheese sauce on top, and mix all together.

Serve immediately!

Variations/substitutions:

add 1 jalapeno or serrano chili if you like it spicier.  I am known to be a spice wuss!

sub white meat for thigh meat

sub peas for broccoli

sub macaroni pasta or penne for cavatelli 

sub fontina for pepperjack, or any other good melting cheese

*Edit: added more variations and the time needed to cook sauce, which I had left out before.

*6 limes  
*1 medium white onion  
*4-6 cloves of garlic  
*2-3 tablespoons of salt  
*1/3 to 1/2 bunch cilantro  
*5 tomatillos  
*5 to 7 jalapenos  
1. Blend Jalapenos, garlic, and tomatillos to salsa consitency. Add blended mix with a capful of olive oil in a medium pot and roast until desired consitency. Stir occasionally.  
2. While roasting, microwave the limes till warm, press/roll them on the counter, cut the ends, and squeeze out the juice into the blender. Microwaving them and rolling them unlocks the juice.  
3. Add onion and cilantro and blend.  
4. Pour the roasted tomatillo in the blender with the lime juice mix.  
5. Cut the pineapple into quarters and add according to your preference (I used 1 quarter). The pineapple will balance out the spice. Blend all together.  
6. Add salt to taste.

What spices do you use on your lamb ? &lt;--- very important.

 What is the flat cut of meat you use to stack up your gigantic Gyro meat stick ?

What is your Tzaziki sauce recipe ?

What salad + extras are important ?

Is Lebanese bread the same as the bread you use ? The Gyro bread looks way more thick, spongy and soft compared to the Lebanese bread of the Doner Kebabs we have. Can I have a recipe please ?

InformationMan	138	34	39	"Back story: My friend and I, we were at this wing place having a drink and wings (duh) and during the course of the lunch we came up with the idea of Sriracha wing sauce. He came up with the idea of the soy sauce based one and i came up the Hoisin sauce based one. Both recipes should make about 23 fl oz, so a test batch. The Hoisin based sauce is milder than the soy sauce based.                                            
                                           
                               
                               
&gt; soy sauce based:
* 1 cup sriracha
* 1/2 cup cider vinegar
* 1/3 soy sauce
* 3 tsp garlic powder 
* 3 tsp white pepper 
* 3 tbsp fresh ginger 
* cracked black pepper (however much you think is good)
* 1 tbsp red chili flakes 
* 1/2 cup of white sugar (going to make it with brown sugar next time its wing day, i think it would be good)
                                

                                      
&gt; Hoisin sauce based:
* 1.5 cup sriracha
* 3/4 cup cider vinegar
* 3/4 Hoisin
* 3 tsp garlic powder 
* 3 tsp white pepper 
* 3 tbsp fresh ginger 
* cracked black pepper (however much you think is good)
* 1 tbsp red chili flakes 



Hey if you do try both of these sauces out can you let me know which one you like better? it is the cause of much debate with my friend and I.

1362690023.0	19v8yi	Baked Ziti w/ Chicken! College kid friendly. Easy recipe.	PriyaAvaani	129	22	10	"Hey guys, 

Its my first time posting to Recipes. Hope you like this simple recipe. I am a college student who is cooking for two people. Most of my recipes are tailored to servings for 2 or just enough for a leftover meal. 


Baked Ziti w/ Chicken

Ingredients
* Ziti Pasta

* Tomato Sauce (Preferably one with a certain flavoring like Garlic and Herb)

* Chicken Breast

* Mozzarella Cheese

* Parmesan Cheese

* Oregano

1. The first thing in this whole recipe would be to get your chicken cooked. I chose to season my chicken with salt, black pepper, minced garlic, minced green scallion (this is my special ingredient, ask in comments if you would like this recipe), garlic powder, onion powder and ""complete seasoning"". This is of course how I choose to season my chicken. Any other combination of spices are welcome here. I also thought about using a cajun type flavor combination to give this entire recipe a slight *kick*.

   1a. Put a pot of boiling water on the stove to start cooking our ziti. Once water has come to a roiling boil     throw in ziti and let cook for 8-10 mins. Once it is cooked. Drain water and put aside.

2. Grill the chicken breasts. Try to make sure that the pieces aren't too thick. I used my panini grill to cook my chicken as I don't have a better grilling appliance in my apartment. It works fantastic as a grill!! (Highly recommend for any college student)

3. Once chicken is finished cut up into small strips. I would say about have the length of your pinky. We want to be able to ""sprinkle the chicken so that we get it in each bite. Then put aside and we will come back to this later. 

4. Get a medium sized baking dish. Preferably one that is more deep than shallow. No need to line the dish with nonstick stuff!!

5. Grab your already cooked ziti and put a layer on the bottom of the dish. Attempt to make it cover the bottom of the dish without stacking 5 pieces of ziti on top of each other!

6. Sprinkle your already cooked chicken strips on top of the pasta. Make sure to get every corner as we want chicken in each bite!

7. Take your pasta sauce and completely cover this layer of chicken and ziti.

8. Sprinkle Mozzarella on top of sauce. 

9. Repeat the layering process once more. Ziti, chicken, sauce, and then mozzarella.

10. As the second layer is your last year I added a small amount of parmesean cheese on top of the mozzarella for an added pazaaz. Then with a light hand, an some dried oregano to the top. Don't over do it! Just enough to cover the top of the dish but ever so slightly.

11. Bake at 350 degrees for around 15 mins. The dish won't be ""hard on the edges"" but will just have heated up enough to melt the cheese and infuse the pasta sauce flavor into the chicken and ziti. 

12. Cut and serve it up!


All the measurements will be up to you depending on how many people you're serving. For the ziti pasta I used about 2 1/2 cups for two people. The dish made enough for leftovers for the next day for both of us.

We have no idea what exactly - we just marked everything on the order, that looked interesting (or was a dumpling). I ordered this cylindrical shaped rice thingie - which was very dry, slightly sweet and had an amazingly crunchy inside surprise! I have no idea what it was, and if I search for rice rolls (the only name I could think of), I come up with nothing useful.
Here is an image of the thingie (http://static2.orstatic.com/UserPhoto/photo/4/3IL/00P0BYC5DBB7B8AAC25594l.jpg) - we only took videos (thought I'd process them and put the up on YouTube, but it breaks my heart every time I see ourselves surrounded by all that yummy food, now half a world away), so it took me some time to find this on the Internet.

This is simple and full of flavour, but if the Greeks amongst us can provide some pointers on how to improve, shoot!

Ingredients 

* 1/2 Leg of lamb
* Baby potatoes
* 3-4 Bay leaves
* tbs Chopped Greek Oregano
* tbs Chopped Rosemary
* Whole pealed shallots 
* Tinned tomatoes
* tbs Tomato puree 
* Chopped Garlic
* Lamb stock
* Feta

Fry the garlic just until it softens up and add the tomato puree to cook out the bitterness. Put the remaining ingredients into the cooker and top with as much stock as necessary to cover everything. Put on a low setting and leave it for 8 hours or more!

When it's cooked the lamb will fall off the bone, it's a beautiful thing. Now skim the oil from the top, serve with generous handful of feta on the top, and a Greek salad and/or bread on the side. 

Anyone else have any recommended slow cooking recipes?

The game uses cooking as a theme, and I thought you guys could help me out, and that it might be a fun challenge as well.

I want to know what basic 'elements' of cooking can be combined into the largest amount of dishes with other things. For example, 

**Eggs, oil, grain, milk, chocolate, fruit**

* eggs + oil + flour (grain) + milk + chocolate = chocolate cake 
* eggs + oil + flour (grain) + milk + fruit = strawberry cake 
* eggs + rice (grain) + oil = fried rice * eggs + oil = fried eggs 
* fruit + chocolate = chocolate-covered strawberries 
* eggs + milk + chocolate = egg cream 
* milk + chocolate = milk chocolate 

**Total: 6 ingredients, 7 recipes**

Here I've grouped together all grains and all fruits just so that I could come up with a handful of recipes. If you think it's unnecessary (or think that other things deserved to be grouped together, like meat) then please, be my guest. Ideally you're aiming for the most recipes possible from the fewest ingredients, and if I'm really lucky I'd like to see around 20+ recipes in total and an even distribution of different ingredients being used.

Why not try our families unconventional substitute? 	gweezer	110	13	51	"My great-grandma was raised on a farm in Italy, while they raised animals for the butcher they were never financially stable enough to keep any meat for themselves. What they did have though was an overabundance of eggs. 

They put eggs in everything in place of meat, sometimes it was great, sometimes not so much. There is one thing that was so fantastic it stood above all other experiments and has now become a bit of a family legend: hard boiled eggs in spaghetti. 

All you have to do is make pasta like you usually would, just throw the raw eggs in the water before you put it to boil, then peel them when you drain the water out. Make the rest of your spaghetti how you normally would-home made or store bought sauce, freshly grated parmesan or that powdered stuff-it doesn't matter, just do what you like. 

My mom loves to keep the eggs whole and eat them like you would eat meatballs, I like to cut them up and mix the yolk in with the sauce. However you eat it this is a much better combination then you would initially think. I urge you to try it next time you want a simple but different meal. "	t5_2qh56	True

Once I forgot to defrost the chicken and over-microwaved it. Once I dropped half my lemon juice allllll over my kitchen floor. It survived all of those things.

**Lemon Chicken**

* 4 Chicken breasts (or pork chops)
* Flour, Salt, &amp; Pepper for dredging
* Olive oil
* White wine (about 8 oz worth)
* 1-2 Lemons (1-2 thin slices, rest juiced)
* Oregano (to taste, I probably use a few teaspoons)
* 1 cup-ish Chicken broth (or dissolved chicken bouillon)
* 7-ish cloves of garlic (sliced)
* Corn starch

1. Salt and pepper and dredge chicken or pork chops in flour. Brown in olive oil.
2. Take the meat out, add the white wine, and cook for about 3 minutes.
3. Add fresh lemon juice, oregano, salt (if using dissolved bouillon, skip the salt), chicken broth, sliced garlic, and cook for a few minutes.
4. Put meat back in, add the lemon slice(s), cover it, cook for a few minutes and thicken the sauce with corn starch.


**Tips**: Use 1 lemon if you don't want a lot of sauce, if you want more, use 2 lemons. Slice the garlic quite thin. You can add a little bit of butter at the end if it's not as velvety as you would like it to be. To thicken the sauce without clumps, take about a cup of the sauce out and whisk in the corn starch, then add it back to the pot.

I'm making the pigeon pie tonight (with game hens, instead, alas). But I totally see a themed holiday feast in my future. 

Ingredients:

1 springform pan with high sides

Pastry dough (get the recipe)

5 pigeons

1/4 tsp. each pepper, salt, mace, nutmeg

boiled palatts (tongue! – optional)

3 hard boiled egg yolks

3 large meatballs, preferably of veal

1/2 cup cooked chopped bacon

artichoke hearts

1-2 Tbs. bacon grease

1 egg for glazing

Roll out pastry dough and drape over the pan. Gently press the dough into the pan to make sure it molded to the sides and bottom. Trim the excess dough and reshape into a ball- this will be your lid.


Put your pigeons in a large pot and cover with water. Simmer for around 45 minutes, or until the meat can be easily pulled from the bone. Remove all the useable meat and discard the bones.


Season the meat with your spices, then lay in the bottom of the pastry. If using tongue, lay over the pigeon meat. Crumble the egg yolk over top of the meat, then flatten the meatballs to form the next layer. Sprinkle the bacon over that, then lay sliced artichoke hearts on the very top. Pour the bacon grease evenly over the top.


Roll out the remaining pastry dough and cut into a circle the size of the bottom of the pan. Lay this circle over the pie filling, brush the edges with water, and roll the outside dough down until it touches the top crust. Pierce the top of the pie in several places to vent the steam, flute the edges in a decorative pattern, and brush the whole thing with beaten egg.

Bake at 350 for 45 minutes to an hour, until the crust is golden.



Serve warm with a nice table red. Shoot guest in the face with an arrow after the meal is over."	t5_2qh56	True

I'm not an uber guru chef or anything, this is my first time making a recipe. It has a bit of spicy zip, and the pointed pepper adds a bit of sweetness. It will also make your knees weak with how awesome it tastes.

[CREAMY BACON JERK BRUSCHETTA CARBONARA](http://imgur.com/a/PpqJa) 

Makes about 2 servings:

INGREDIENTS: 

1 tbsp. coconut oil

1 tbsp. bacon grease 

1/3 large red onion (chopped)

4 thick bacon strips (chopped)

3 tbsp. butter

4 cloves of garlic (minced)

15 fresh basil leaves (minced)

1 tsp. Jamaican jerk paste

1 cup heavy cream

1 tbsp. all-purpose organic white flour

10oz of fresh grape tomatoes (quartered)

½ large sweet pointed red pepper 

1 tbsp. dried oregano

1 tsp. dried cilantro 

¼ tsp. cayenne 

½ tsp. black pepper

salt (to taste)


DIRECTIONS:

In a large sauce pan on low heat add coconut oil, bacon grease, onion, bacon and garlic. Cook for a while until it smells good, don’t burn the fucking garlic. Add the butter, basil and jerk paste, mix that shit up and let it sizzle for a bit. Add the cream and thicken it up a bit with the flour. Add the tomatoes, peppers and the rest of the spices. Keep stirring occasionally, simmering on low heat for about 20 minutes. Stop yourself from putting your face in the sauce when you realize how fucking amazing it tastes. Pour your badass sauce on some cooked up penne and add a seasoned chicken breast (jerk flavoured of course). "	t5_2qh56	True

1346889569.0	zf6cv	Chicken, Black Bean and Quinoa Stuffed Peppers with Cheese. Healthy and filling!	hold_on_2_your_butts	111	25	20	"* 5 bell peppers
* 3/4 cups quinoa
* 15 ounces rinsed black beans
* 30 ounces diced tomatoes, liquid reserved
* 5 ounces chicken (about one small boneless/skinless chicken breast)
* 1 medium	onion
* 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (oregano, parsley, basil, rosemary mix)
* 2 teaspoon ground cumin, separate
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 cup Veggie Shreds monterrey and cheddar cheese mix
* 2 tbsp olive oil, separate
* 1 packet no sodium chicken bouillon
* 1 1/2 cups	 water


**Directions**:

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Dice onion and garlic.

Heat 1 tbsp oil in large pan or dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until translucent (about five minutes).

Add 1 teaspoon cumin and all cayenne and pepper. Stir in drained tomatoes, reserving liquid. Cook 5 minutes, or until most of liquid has evaporated.

Stir in black beans, quinoa, and 1.5 cups water. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until quinoa is tender. Stir in 1 cup cheese.

While quinoa is cooking, cut chicken into centimeter cubes.
Cook chicken in 1 tbsp olive oil until 180 degrees, about five minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cumin. After cooked, shred chicken.

While chicken is cooking, the tops of the bell peppers or the tops of the sides, depending on your pepper sits. You want it to lay flat on the baking pan. De-rib and de-seed.

Pour liquid from tomatoes in bottom of baking dish.

Stir chicken into quinoa mix. Fill each bell pepper half with heaping 3/4-cup quinoa mixture, and place in baking dish. Cover with foil, and bake 40 minutes to 1 hour or until browned on top.

Drizzle each pepper with pan juices before serving. Optional: sprinkle each pepper with additional cheese.

5 servings. 390 calories per serving.

This can easily be made vegetarian by omitting the chicken and changing the chicken bouillon to vegetable. It can be made vegan by omitting the cheese.

1322002837.0	mm102	All my recipes on one piece of paper.	datathief	102	18	17	"[This one-page PDF](http://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxRuSqPpxtktNDBkNTUwZWItNDNlMy00NDgzLWJiNWYtMmFjNjdlNzA5ZWFi) contains all the recipes I use on a daily basis, tested and tweaked and re-tested until they're about as foolproof as I can make them.  Maybe some of you can make use of it.

Edit: Remember the ratios are by weight. If you really really need to use measuring cups, you can probably get away with some simple rules (but I've not tested them):

* Double the flour column. A cup of flour weighs about half as much as a cup of any of the other ingredients.
* 1 egg is about 1/4 of a cup.
* 1 tsp baking powder or 1/2 tsp yeast etc. per cup of flour.

Also, 180°C = 350°F and 220°C = 430°F (thanks [drgradus](http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/mm102/all_my_recipes_on_one_piece_of_paper/c32426j)).

Edit again: Since this is getting a bit of attention, some tips:

Mix in a handful of grated cheddar for tasty almost-Red-Lobster biscuits.

Add finely chopped mushroom, kidney or sausage to white sauce and season with salt and pepper to taste for a quick and very easy country gravy.

Roll out doughnut dough to about half an inch thick (flour the surface and the rolling pin well to stop it sticking), and cut into rings using a couple of different-sized cookie cutters. Fry them in about half an inch of vegetable oil; if the oil gets too hot they'll brown too quickly and the inside won't get cooked, so practise a bit if necessary. Glaze them while they're still hot.

For Cheddar Cheese Fondue:

20% Gruyere Swiss Cheese
80% Sharp Cheddar
Beer (depends on how much cheese you're using - enough beer to make it melty)
clove of garlic, minced
1 tsp. ground mustard
Worcestershire sauce

Grate the cheese and dust it with flour until the cheese is well covered.  Heat the beer on med-low then add the garlic and ground mustard.  Add the cheese and mix in well.  Add worcestershire sauce to taste.

EDIT:  After the fondue is made, keep it on low and stir it occasionally so it doesn't burn.  You can make this on a double burner, keeping it on low and you won't have to worry about it burning.


To make it Cajun style, add Ro-tel, ground cayenne and baby shrimp.

If you're concerned about using beer, you can substitute milk.

For Swiss fondue, make the Gruyere 80% and the Cheddar 20%.

http://i.imgur.com/vsbuRru.jpg

To answer some of the questions posted there:

- tastes the same as normal egg

- roughly 8-10 normal eggs. It was going to be an omelet. Turned into a frittata 

- I got mine on discount for 3 bucks, but normal cost 10 AUD here, considering the amount of eggs and that it fed 3 people with only half consumed. It's a worthwhile investment...although still mostly novelty.

- Had a quick look and emus are apparently native to Australia, where I am, but for some reason the eggs here are ostrich...maybe easier to farm or something, no idea.

So! what are your great spanakopita recipes? Also, do you have any cool variations? This is my first time doing a Greek night and I am super excited! Thanks guys!"	t5_2qh56	True

And the next day's meal? Just add water. The amount of vegetables and cooking time will depend on how big your chicken is, I think I had about a 3 pounder.

**Ingredients**

* 1 whole chicken
* 2 carrots, diced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 1 onion, diced
* 4-5 potatoes, peeled and diced
* olive oil
* herbs of your choice
* salt and pepper
* garlic or onion **powder**

**Method for Roast Chicken**

1. Wash and dry your chicken. Let it sit uncovered in the fridge for 1-2 hours before you start cooking it. This process dries out the skin so when you stick it in the oven it will get crispy and not steam. As usual, make sure it's fully defrosted. Preheat your oven to 475 F.

2. Get a roasting pan, or a pan big enough to fit your chicken. Start mounding the dices vegetables in the center of the pan. Your chicken will sit on this bed to keep it from sticking to the pan and also so it doesn't boil in its juices.

3. In a bowl, drizzle the diced potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle your choice of herbs, salt and pepper. Mix well. Distribute the potatoes around the vegetables. Try not to mix the veggies and potatoes together.

4. If there is left over olive oil in the potato bowl, grab a brush and start to brush the chicken with it. If there isn't any pour a little into the bowl, add the seasonings and brush. The bird shouldn't be super oily, I suggest about a 1/4 olive oil (maybe less). Sprinkle on the garlic or onion powder.

5. Place the bird, breast side up, on top of the veggies and stick it in the oven. Set the timer for 10 minutes. After that's up lower the temperature to 400 F and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until juices run clear. You can turn over the chicken half way through, then turn back to crisp up the skin.

6. Make some separate vegetables if you want. I suggest only eating the roasted potatoes. Serve with a salad, some rice or roasted broccoli.

**Method for Chicken Soup**

1. Shred left over meat and set aside.
2. Put the vegetables that made the bed for the chicken and bones in a crock pot. Fill with water so that it covers everything. Add a few bay leaves.
4. Cook on low for 12 hours.
5. Remove the bones and vegetables, separate. Pick the bones clean for any chicken you may have missed. Throw out the vegetables. Don't feel bad, they've given up their nutrition to the broth.
6. Strain the broth through a cheesecloth, coffee filter, or colander.
7. Transfer to glass jars or glass containers and stick it in the fridge to cool. Try not to use plastic.
8. Skim off any fat once cooled and put any extra in the freezer.
9. Cook vegetables you want in a little olive oil until soft. Add in the cooled broth. Add a little water and simmer.
10. Add back the shredded chicken and noodles on medium heat and cook until noodles are done.

I don't necessarily need to cook bhuna. What I would like to cook is something that is easy just to get the basic concepts of cooking Indian food. I still have a ton of spices from cooking the bhuna (paprika, cardamom seeds, etc.) I don't care if it is a long process or needs a bunch of spices or whatever.

EDIT: Didn't realize there were so many pinoys/pinays on reddit!  To explain myself: my mother left out peppercorns because we always complained about biting into them when I was a kid.  So I just put a lot of ground pepper in my recipe.  Also, the potatoes are because my mother grew up on a farm and was feeding 10 kids on a very small budget, so potatoes helped to feed more kids on a small budget.

Start boiling water. Clean and peel the shrimp. Chop the onions and jalapeño finely.

Start boiling the linguini. Put some onions on a pan with some olive oil at medium heat. Let them brown a bit and squeeze the limes and add the jalapeño. Let them cook together for a minute or two. Add some garlic salt and pepper and throw on the shrimp. Once the shrimp are pink add the tomato alfredo sauce and add your desired amount of garlic salt. Let it simmer until the sauce changes its' texture to become more ""sauce-like"". You'll notice. Strain the pasta and eat together. It is unfairly delicious.

* use a shallot instead of diced onion
* zest the lime(s) before juicing
* mix salt and lime zest into the lime juice instead of adding those directly to the guacamole


The rationale for adding salt to the lime juice is that it will dissolve the salt and allow it to be more evenly distributed with less mixing, because the action of mixing breaks up the chunks of avocado. If you don't like chunky guacamole, then you can safely ignore that.

What do you do?

Edit: My recipe:

    2-3 avocados
    1 small-to-medium shallot, diced
    2 small limes, zested &amp; juiced
    salt &amp; pepper, to taste
    a dash of cumin
    a dash of dried cilantro
    a little bit of sriracha
    1-2 cloves of garlic
    1 plum tomato, seeded and diced
    1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped

I cut my avocados in half and squeeze them out of the peels (it's easier than peeling), and dump everything into the bowl together. I mix a bunch of the random ingredients into the lime juice for even distribution of the flavor, and gently mix it up with a fork. I then press saran wrap against the finished guacamole so no air is touching it and let it chill in the fridge. Sometimes, I dust a little bit of paprika on top. I don't use enough to  really taste the paprika but it adds some nice color."	t5_2qh56	True
1357247969.0	15wqv7	French Onion Soup	Dr_VanBuren	99	30	45	"I kinda broke my budget doing this, but with a few adjustments, I figured out a way to make a decent batch of french onion soup for not a lot of money.

Ingredients:

16 cups beef stock

4 large yellow onions

Thyme

Olive Oil

Garlic Rosemary blend

1 loaf french bread

White wine (dry, preferably)

Raw sugar (white can be used if nothing is available)

Swiss guyere cheese

Provolone cheese

1. Cut bread into chunks, size is your choice.

2. Put bread in a gallon bag, add olive oil and rosemary blend and shake until sufficiently coated.  Bake at 350 degrees farenheit until dry.

3. Cut onions to preferred to size and shape.  I cubed mine and then let the layers unravel as they were cooked.

4. Saute onions in olive oil.  As they begin to brown, add as much wine as you see fit.  Add a pinch of sugar to aid in caramelization. 

5. Pour beef stock into pot, add two teaspoons of thyme.

6. When onions are sufficiently browned, add to the stock.

7. When bread is sufficiently dry (I waited until the edges were browning), add to the stock.

8. Let simmer, add wine and season to taste

9. When served, add preferred amount of cheese and let it melt over soup

I adjusted some values to make a bigger batch and left certain values out because I honestly didn't measure much, I just added it.  Experiment, see what works."	t5_2qh56	True

1304561286.0	h4hh9	Butter Chicken 	Astro493	102	31	23	"So here's the deal friends. This recipe isn't complicated, and the amount of each ingredient can vary widely depending on your preference. The key to any good dish, especially one made with relativly intense ingredients, yet very savoury in flavour, is matching the spices to one another. So, if Cardamom is your deal, then let it rock, and if not, then cut back on it. So here goes:


Butter chicken is supposed to be made as two seperate dishes that you subsequently mix together. The chicken has to be cooked (almost tandoori styles) and then mixed in with the mugh makni masala (Butter chicken spices...in this case in the form of a thick  gravy). 
Also, this is a fantastically unhealthy dish for you. It has butter in the damn name, what do you expect? But fuck it, treat yourself from time to time.


As with all cooking, letting your ingredients meld with one another for a while before cooking is always good, so let your food chill (pun intended).


For the Tandoori Paste (make 2 days in advance) 


1 tsp Garlic Powder


1 tsp Ground ginger 

1tsp Clove (use powder if you're not using a magic bullet, use whole 
cloves if you are )

1/2 tsp nutmeg

1tsp Mace powder

1 1/2 tbsp Cumin (Jeera) 

2tbsp ground Corriander 

1tsp Fenugreek powder

1tsp Cinnamon 

1tsp Fresh ground pepper 

2tsp brown cardamom (don't use the green one....just don't)

3tbsp of Oil/ Ghee (Indian vegetable lard..yum!)


Then toss that into your magic bullet/food processor and puree the crap together until it forms a paste. This will be sufficient for about 1kg of chicken.


Let the paste sit overnight so the flavours meld together
Remember people, feel free to toy with the ingredients. It's cooking, not rocket science 


For the Chicken:

Cube 1kb of chicken breast. Trim off all fat (cause this is already unhealthy enough) and then coat with the Tandoori paste. Refridgerate over night. 

For the Butter chicken sauce

1 tsp red chilli powder (remember, this is supposed to be savory, not spicy, so don't over do it with the spice) 

3 bay leaves 

1 cinnamon stick 

8 cardamom pods 

8 pepper corns

3 Onions chopped (I like onions, like REALLY REALLY like onions, so feel 
free to use less)

2 tsp corriander power 

2 tsp cumin 

1 tsp ginger (crushed) 

1 can tomatoe paste

2 tbsp dried fenugreek (raw seeds will work as well) 

4 tbsp butter (Deal with it)

salte to taste 


1 cup FULL FAT CREAM (yeah, you want butter chicken, this is what's in it kids, and it's fucking amazing....ok you can use low fat yogurt, but seriously, treat yourselves, it's not like you drink  1 cup of cream a day...or at least dear god I hope not) 


So mix ALL of this together and blend it. If you have a magic bullet, amazing, if not just mix it together by hand. Let this liquid mix sit in the fridge while you cook the chicken. 


FOR THE CHICKEN that has been marinating over night: 

Bring a frying pan with about 2 tbsp of oil to a medium heat. Then fry the chicken. Fry to the point where it's past browning, so about 3/4 of the way to cooked. Then remove and store in a bowl. Do this for all the chicken. 


FOR THE SAUCE

Bring your cream/yogurt mix to a boil. If it's the Yogurt you chose, add water to aid the boiling process. If you used the cream, you needn't add anything.n  Make sure you SLOWLY bring it to a boil so as to not just burn the cream onto the bottom of the pan. Make sure you keep stirring so that disgusting skin doens't form on top of the dish (ew). 
Once this has reached a low boil, add the chicken in. 
Let the chicken cook in the sauce for about 20 - 30 minutes and BAM! Butter chicken. 
Serve on Basmati rice garnished with cilantro :) 

It looks like a lot, but it's totally worth it.

1373918548.0	1id17c	Thoughts on Chili [x-post from /r/cooking]	Asscough	96	25	4	"There are hundreds (if not thousands) chili varieties. Still, when you come across a recipe the list of ingredients may say ""one red chili"". This is the same as if you instruct someone to use ""a vegetable"" in their food; there are a wide variety of red chilis out there.

For example, the widely used spice called *cayenne pepper* is actually a chili. Or just imagine the disappointment when you put a mild ""regular red chili"" in a dish of authentic Mexican *chili con carne* or if you complete a fruity salad with a deadly *Habanero* (which is also a chili). 

For the sake of world culinarism or at least us half-baked home chefs here on Reddit (/r/recipes and /r/cooking), it would be extremely useful if people took the time to examine what kind of chili they use in the foods we see the recipes for here. You know, for example, provide me the chance to achieve that authentic taste of Texan food while cooking for my friends here in Europe.

 
When you buy a chili, you usually can get a hold of what you get on the label of the packaging or by asking the merchant if you buy from a market. 
There are several species of chili, of which the most common are: 

**Annuum**, which includes many common varieties such as bell peppers, wax, cayenne, jalapeños, and the chiltepin

**Frutescens**, which includes malagueta, tabasco and Thai peppers, piri piri, and Malawian Kambuzi

**Chinense**, which includes the hottest peppers such as the naga, habanero, Datil and Scotch bonnet

**Pubescens**, which includes the South American rocoto peppers

**Baccatum**, which includes the South American aji peppers


I am aware that this wish/idea will not catch on immediately but, it has caught on before: white pepper and black pepper are different spices nowadays instead of just being pepper.

Sapiens_Ursus	94	22	55	"A couple of years ago, I ""invented"" a recipe that I call Breaksplodeo. I say ""invented"" because I'm sure it's been done before. It's kind of costly, and definitely not very healthy, which is why I only make it on special occasions, usually only once or twice a year.

For most of the ingredients, type and quanitity is variable, depending on personal preference.

•1/2 - 1 lb. sausage

•1 lb. bacon

•8 - 10 eggs

•1/2 - 1 lb. shredded cheese

•3/4 cup heavy cream

•1 onion, chopped

•1 bell pepper, chopped

•1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced or chopped (I prefer ""baby 'bellas"", as they're small and pre-sliced)

Brown sausage, cook bacon and cut into small pieces. Whisk eggs with heavy cream until thoroughly mixed, add cheese and vegetables. Grease a casserole dish, line bottom with sausage, then pour egg mixture over it. Lastly, sprinkle the bacon on top and bake at 375F - 400F for 45 - 60 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown on top.

I'm still experimenting and tweaking the formula, but all my friends love it.

Edit: pronounced like ""breck-splo-dee-o"".  Also, mucked up the formatting.

This is my own invention and the first time I've written my own recipe so looking forward to hearing people's thoughts. The inclusion of mushroom stock added an intense umami flavour throughout the sauce. Noticeably absent are shallots (forgot to buy them!) and brandy (too damn expensive!).

The cooking process comprises two stages (three if you don't have meat stock handy). The mushroom stock can be made in advance, and the finished sauce takes about 30 minutes to assemble.

**Ingredients**

**For the mushroom stock**

550g assorted mushrooms (I used a combination of baby button, chestnut and large open mushrooms)  
2 cloves garlic  
A few curly parsley stalks (leaves picked and reserved)  
6 sprigs thyme  
1 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice  
Knob of butter

**For the finished sauce**

1/2 pint meat stock (I used beef stock as I was serving the sauce with steak)  
Mushroom stock  
3 chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced  
1 tsp English or Dijon mustard  
Worcestershire sauce  
Reserved parsley leaves, finely chopped  
80 ml single cream  
Knob of butter

**Method**

For the stock, roughly chop the mushrooms. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and add the butter. When bubbling, add the mushrooms and sauté for 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Finally, add the parsley stalks, thyme and vinegar/lemon juice. Add enough water to cover the ingredients, cover the pan with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside.

To finish the sauce, heat olive oil and butter in a saucepan and add sliced mushrooms. Sauté for 2 minutes and add the mushroom and meat stock. Reduce liquid down by two thirds. Add Worcestershire sauce to taste, and the mustard. Stir well. Finish the sauce with the fresh parsley and single cream. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a rapid simmer for a minute and the sauce is ready to serve."	t5_2qh56	True

most delicious meal you like to cook regularly. I'll 
start! [x-post from AskReddit]"		88	22	81	"***Sausage, Tomato, and Arugula Pasta***

You'll need... a large 12""-13"" frying pan or Wok (I like using a Wok), tongs/two cooking utensils to toss your pasta, optionally you might need a medium sauce pan depending on the Fettucini you buy.

**Ingredients** 

* 1 lb Mild Italian Sausage or Turkey Sausage - I prefer regular ground pork, but both are good
* 1/2 lb Fettucini Noodles (or half a package of dry fettucini)
* 3-4 Cups of Baby Arugula 
* 1/2 Tsp ground black pepper
* 2 Tbsp of Minced Garlic (I like the jarred minced garlic in olive oil, but you can mince your own garlic ahead of time, if you like)
* 1 Pint of Cherry or Grape Tomatoes
* 1 Package of Shaved Parmesan, Romano, or Asiago - all are great, in any combination

**Directions**

Step 1. Begin by preparing your pasta. I use dried/boxed fettucini and have worked out how to cook it aldente during my college days. Boil the pasta until it is just soft enough to be malleable (5-8 minutes), then remove from heat and let it sit for another 3-6 minutes while you're preparing the dish. Strain noodles only when you're ready to combine all ingredients at the end.

Step 2. Heat some olive oil in your frying pan over medium. Start browning your Sausage and breaking it up into smaller pieces. When meat is starting to turn grey, add your garlic and ground black pepper (hopefully using a pepper grinder). When meat is almost cooked, throw in the Tomatoes. Cover pan and reduce heat to medium/low. Simmer for 3-5 minutes. Take a spatula or spoon and crush tomatoes in the pan. Combine and toss fettucini noodles, about 1/2 cup of cheese, and arugula leaves. Let simmer for another minute uncovered for cheese to melt. Plate your meal and sprinkle some shaved cheese on top for garnish. 

It's one of the simplest, most delicious meals I prepare regularly. What's yours?

----------------------------

I want to give credit to Ivy Manning for this recipe even though I might have put my own suggestions in for ingredients and cooking instructions. It's simple to make and just sooooo tasty!

Ingredients:
    
     
    56oz crushed tomatoes
     
    1/2 - 1 yellow onion depending on size and strength of onion, chopped
     
    3 - 6 cloves of garlic, minced
     
    1lb of mild or spicy Italian sausage (I prefer the spicy)
     
    ~2tbsp of Italian Seasoning. I use the McCormick Tuscan Style.
     
    1 - 4 mushrooms (optional but reccomended), roughly chopped
     
    a bit of ground cayenne red pepper
     
    
On medium heat, brown the Italian sausage. Drain the meat and add it back into the pan. 
     
Add the onion, garlic, and mushrooms if you choose to use them. Let it cook on medium heat for 3-5 minutes. You should be able to smell the garlic and onion very strongly. 
    
Add the tomatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed evenly. Let the sauce simmer for ~5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
     
Add the Italian seasoning, stir well. Add a little bit of cayenne pepper. It's very important not to add too much especially if you plan on keeping leftovers over night. Stir in the cayenne pepper. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more cayenne to taste keeping in mind that it will become more powerful with time.
     
At this point, I usually put it on low heat while I'm cooking my angle hair pasta making sure to keep stirring both. I recommend that you serve it with cottage cheese, it just adds a little extra texture and cools down the sauce since I'm too impatient to wait for the sauce to cool before I eat it :).
    
Hope you like it :)

The recipe is a ratio based on how much meat you have. So don't throw the wrapper away before you know how many pounds of meat you have.


Use whole chicken thighs with skin on. Or a nice hunk of pork with some fat to it, cut the pork into 1"" cubes.


For every one pound of meat: 

- two smashed cloves garlic
- two bay leaves
- two ounces of apple cider vinegar 


One tea bell full of [pickling spice](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/PicklingSpice.htm) per pot. 


**Directions**

1) put garlic, bay leaves, cider vinegar and tea bell into bottom of large pot. 

2) place meat on top of the spices

3) fill with water just enough so that the meat is submerged

*3.5) Optional: add a few table spoons of tomato paste to the pot if you are making chicken version. Not so great with the pork version.*

4) bring to a boil and then cook on medium until meat is cooked through. Add soy sauce to taste if you like. Serve over rice. 


Note: you can cook chicken and pork together just the same as if they were separate. "	t5_2qh56	True

I feel like I will be able to make one batch of lame tacos and then still have tons of seasoning and sauce left over.  Would it be good with chili? I am not sure if I can find plain lettuce to make taco salad (or use as a topping).  And it will be a little difficult getting cheese that works as well.

Basically, you're just going to boil an omelette. 

First, put a large pot on to boil.

 While it's heating up, gather three or four eggs, a sandwich-sized plastic ziplock bag, and anything you want to put into your omelette. 

Break the eggs into the bag, and add any of the other ingredients you want. This is great for getting rid of any left-overs. 

Seal the bag and mush it with your hands until you have it all solidly mixed together. The yolks should break while you do this.

When the water has come to a rolling boil, just put the **sealed** bag into the pot and let it cook for about 6-9 minutes, depending on the size of the omellete.  (you may have to roll the bag to its other side halfway through to get it to cook evenly)

When the time's up, use a pair of tongs to remove the bag from the water. Place it onto a plate **that you will not be eating off of** and open the bag. Careful not to burn yourself, as it may release some steam.

Poke the omlette with a fork before removing it to see if it is done. It should be fairly resistant, and pretty easy to judge. 

If it's done, up-end it onto another plate. It should look like a burrito, as the egg will have cooked enough to keep the shape of the bag.

It's that easy, and you can customize it however you like. Have fun with this easy breakfast recipe.

Absinthe42	81	18	42	"I turned 21 recently, and instead of going out and getting trashed like a normal person would, I spent the night doing what I really love: cooking. I made up this recipe, and it. Was. Amazing! So I thought I'd share the wealth. You will need:

1 lb pasta (I used penne) 
1/2 lb bacon, chopped into 1/4"" pieces 
12 oz chicken (You can use canned, I did) 
1 small onion 
2 cloves of garlic, minced 
3/4 c hot sauce 
2 T butter 
2 T flour 
2 t dry mustard 
1 pint heavy cream (or half and half, if you prefer) 
8 oz cheddar cheese, grated 
4 oz blue cheese, crumbled 
1 oz cream cheese or sour cream

Preheat oven to 350, and coat a 9x9 baking dish with cooking spray.
Fill a large pot with water, and boil pasta until al dente. Drain when done cooking.

Meanwhile, in a medium sized pan over medium high heat, cook bacon part way, and then add onions. Cook until the onions are soft, and then add the garlic, and chicken. Cook chicken through, and then add 1/4 c hot sauce. Reduce heat and wait for the sauce to bubble. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, and then add the flour. Whisk the roux until it is a light brown, and then add the mustard. Whisk until the mixture is smooth. Add cream and remaining hot sauce. Let cream simmer over heat until the cream coats a metal spoon. Add the cheddar cheese and blue cheese. Whisk to incorporate quickly. Once the cheese has melted, add the cream cheese/sour cream.

Add the chicken mixture to the cheese, and stir until evenly incorporated. Pour the pasta into your baking dish, and pour the cheese over it. Stir to make sure the cheese/bacon/chicken is evenly distributed through your pasta. If you want, you can sprinkle some extra cheese or bacon on top. I used both.

Bake for 20-30 minutes, and then DEVOUR. It's better fresh than reheated. But believe me, it's unlikely you'll have leftovers.

Example::

**Search**: Banana bread

**Results**: 20 recipes

**View**: Using a cloud/Venn diagram/graph presentation it would show that 15 of the recipe are actually very similar and form one cluster. The other recipes would form their own groups or float on their own. The outliers are different because maybe they are vegan or gluten free, and have rather different ingredients, or maybe one of them is for a banana bread martini.  One could drill into the main recipe grouping to see that there is a sub grouping of recipes without nuts, or some that have more or less of various ingredients, or see which recipes are exact copies of each other. 

To me this would be much more useful than picking a recipe because it has extra votes or super pretty pictures. And I am sure that there is some super cool way to present this information in a useful way. 

There is one recipe comparison site out there now, but its interface still makes you do too much work to figure out how the recipes vary.

Maybe I should start a Kickstarter project for this... anyone else think this would be useful? Or this will be my retirement project... or some Redditor will take this idea and make a million dollars with it.




**Update: New Info relative to comments:**



**What is the problem I am having?**

Answer: I don't like how currently one has to sort between the results for recipe searches or trust their relevance/popularity ordering. It is hard to compare recipes because ingredients are written differently in different orders. You have to compare recipes one at a time to see how they vary. I feel that often the recipes with many stars or votes actually have the same ingredients as some recipes that have no votes. Maybe the popular one just has a nice picture, a cute 'I used to cook this with my Grandma' introduction or some sponsored ingredient so is being promoted to sell you something.  Letting my stomach choose a recipe because it has a pretty picture does not always work. I am more data oriented and want a more objective way to compare.


**When I look for recipes I may be looking for different reasons:**

* Scenario 1. I am looking for a new recipe and I want to make the standard recipe is and not accidentally pick someone’s diet or custom variation. The result graph would let me see what which recipes fall in the main cluster and which are outliers.
* Scenario 2. I am tired of the standard recipe and I want something different. Then I would be interested in the outliers. 
* Scenario 3. I want to be creative with a recipe. I want to see what the current standard recipe is and I want to look at variations - see how other people have customized a given recipe. I may take components from different customizations and make my own version.


**What am I currently missing?**

* The killer method of showing the information. I know that there is some slick but very clear/easy to understand way to show this information, but I have not nailed it down yet. I need a grad student to a project on information presentation to help out. Oh... this site has ideas: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/
* Motivation. This has been working through the back of my head for several years.


**Development:**

* I am actually a software engineer myself. I could do most of this work myself. I would love to do the data collection, parsing and testing variations of the equivalency algorithms. I am not the best with front end development and this site needs a great interface.
* **Data Source**: I would crawl the main recipe sites and parse the information into my database. I would absolutely keep links to the original sites and send users of the search engine back to these sites.
* I would include as much information as possible in the algorithm that relates recipes. Popularity/Ratings/# of Comments/Likes/Pins can be factored in to help recommend recipes within clusters. I would want to somehow balance those values between sites. How to compare 80 up votes on one site vs. 12 comments on another site?
* Parsing the recipes will be fun. There are many ways to say the same thing in recipes: '2 boiled eggs' vs. '2 eggs, boiled' - same thing
* Equivalency: Determining the relationships between ingredients: sour cream and light sour cream are almost the same and score a higher equivalency than sour cream and cream cheese (slight relationship). How do you score whole eggs in one recipe and just egg whites in another?
* Seems that this system would help spot typos. Why does this one recipe call for 2 T. salt when the others ask for 2 t. salt?


**Notes::**

* Techniques/clear instructions/step by step photos can help differentiate recipes with the same ingredients. Cooks Illustrated recipes would not get the extra credit they deserve for their attention to technique.
* Once the recipes are fully parsed, they could be shown in different listings. Ex. sort number of ingredients (ex. one recipe uses Lipton soup mix and this other uses 12 spices), calories per serving (need servings per recipe and calories per ingredient info), and cost per serving (need average cost per ingredient info)
* One option would be to let the user filter by recipe source. They could pick AllRecipes and use this just compare the AllRecipes results. Ex. I just searched for Banana Bread on allrecipes.com and I got 274 results. What the heck do you do with 274 recipes? I want a better way to compare those results than their Relevance/Rating/Popularity.
* For my last birthday I went to several of the major recipe sites to look for chocolate cake recipes. The one I picked promised that it was very moist. It lied. :) I am not sure that my new recipe search system would have found me the perfect chocolate cake recipe but I think it would have helped me compare more recipes. (Please DO NOT link/post chocolate cake recipes.)
* I can cook but looking at recipes is more of a hobby. I love looking at Foodgawker and Tastespotting. A good picture can sell a recipe but I still want to know if there is something different/special about that specific recipe or if it is a beautiful presentation of a standard set of ingredients. I want to know if some food network star's recipe is actually the same ingredients as these 10 other recipes or if they have made some interesting twist.
* The once going, the system can be expanded to search at other levels other than recipe title - search for one or more ingredients, for a course or a cuisine.
* Gojee is beautiful! I had not seen that site before. I will definitely check it out. It looks great for searching recipes across blogs and picking with my eyes/stomach. 
* I am not looking for the site to 'pick the best recipe'. The site does not know what I am looking for. I just want a different way for me to make the choice.



**TLDR: I want to build a better way to show the results for recipe searches.  274 results for banana bread?!?!**

**Edit #1**:  Thanks for the great suggestions so far.  Getting a few grilling options; unfortunately we live in an apartment and there is no outdoor grilling permitted.  Our cooking options are: *Stove-top, [Griddle](http://www.promotionalpromo.com/Upfiles/Prod_t/George-Foreman-Griddle_2010017055476.jpg), Oven and/or Slow-Cooker.*

**Edit #2**:  Our initial inclination was to give it some kind of cracked black pepper/steak spice rub, sear it, and bake it.  Not sure how long to bake it though, and unfortunately we don't have a cooking thermometer.  [We were initially thinking something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTHcWOWFdRg)

**Edit #3**: Blown away by the responses.  Thank you guys for your suggestions!  I want to try a lot of these...

**Edit #4**:  Ok, I showed this thread to my SO.  She is also blown away by the responses.  THANKS!!
One common theme among a lot of these it to marinate/season overnight, so without actually ""picking"" a winner, we created a marinade rub out of: *Dijon mustard, yellow mustard, cracked black pepper, salt, onion powder and garlic powder.  We then rolled the coated tenderloin in breadcrumbs.*  We've left it overnight with intentions of cooking it this evening.  I think the plan is to sear it on each side with some onions and garlic and then bake it at 400F for 15mins (it's not a large cut).  Thank you again for all the great suggestions!"	t5_2qh56	True

1358045366.0	16gz3w	Please help me cook better for my veggie-phobic boyfriend!	lysansa	98	39	224	"Hi, any recipes/tips/whatever is extremely appreciated. My boyfriend will eat no vegetables. Eating on his own he's into starches, white bread, candy, sugar, and the so on. The healthiest thing he eats is an Activia everyday for regularity and an occasional apple if I slice and core it for him.

He won't eat anything he knows is a vegetable. It seems like it's much more of an 'on principle' thing, like I am trying to be spiteful...not just extremely concerned with his health. He is pretty thin, and has been unhealthily thin (was 130lb/6'4"" at one point). His dad, not even 60, has  type two diabetes. His brother had a stroke as teenager and is paraplegic. So, my boyfriend's crap nutrition scares me. His mottos, however, are food is better than no food, and 'how can eating food be bad for you?', and 'people live long enough with whatever diets they have, if they have one'. He grew up with spaghetti/can of tomato soup as sauce, chicken, gravy, mashed potatoes, and a lot of yellow cake.

I am not an experienced cook but can handle most basic types of meals. Does anyone have any veggie concealing tips/recipes for me? For example...I was highly successful with a meatloaf with a lot of shredded carrot/onion inside. Shredding bell pepper into tomato sauce has worked. 

Please help me out, getting a little more veggies (other than corn and potatoes) in my boyfriend would make me feel a ton better (and him probably too after his body adjusts). I don't really need any ""he needs to grow up"" comments, either. Also, he'll eat things with veggies cooked around meat or whatever and will pick them out, if I am making something I like. No matter how finely I chop things, though, if they are visible, he will pick them out with a ton of determination. He comes from an area that eats like this, and his whole family eats with this kind of diet. I'm not a super health freak, but taking nursing school pre-reqs and a nutrition class has me feeling pretty concerned.

Please help--I'm on parole for putting chia seeds in mashed potatoes last night (made them after having a few beers). I love my boyfriend, even if he's heading for a heart attack/stroke/diabetes, but I want to do as much as I can. I need to lay low for a while, so give ideas. :)

I am kind of numb with grief regarding a friend of mine that's just been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. He was the chef in the family, so his wife has put out requests for ""real food"" as the best she can do for him is order a pizza. He's sick of pizza. 

I love this family and I also enjoy cooking. It's a family of 3, 2 adults, one 12 year old. I have above basic cooking skills (I can blanch things and make bechamel! :P), but don't know if I qualify as an ""intermediate"" cook in these parts. 

Basically, I want to comfort them with food. But, due to the shock and grief of it all (he was just diagnosed and had surgery in the space of the last 2 weeks), I can't think of anything substantial. I don't want to have her worry about making anything, and I guess post surgery he's been left with a voracious appetite. I want something they'll all enjoy (and reheat) and that I can successfully pull off. So, any comfort food ideas that are a bit fancy pants but that their 12 year old will also (possibly) eat. She's just discovered cooking herself, so I don't think she'd only eat ""kiddie"" stuff.

Wow, look at me rambling! Anyway, thanks for reading, and I look forward to any ideas that come my way. Thanks in advance.



**Edit:** Wow, thanks SO much for all the ideas. I really appreciate the links, and if anyone wants to post/PM the recipes they've mentioned, I'd be so grateful.

What you need
-Cast iron pan(everyone should have one, if you don't get one. they are cheap)
-salt
-garlic cloves, sliced(as much as you want, I use probably half a head)
-butter

That's it, don't fuck with it.

Turn your cast iron pan on high, throw some salt on it
Once the salt starts smoking throw your meat down, let it sear nicely till it's brown, lift steak up, throw more salt down and flip it. Sear that for a little bit then turn heat down to medium.
As steak is cooking put butter on it, will keep it moist
Flip steak a few times while reapplying butter.
When steak is near your liking, rare/medium-rare is the only way really throw garlic into all that melted butter/fat that's in the pan, swoosh it around and cover, seriously, COVER the pan. Pull steak off onto your plate and scoop all that garlic goodness onto steak, you can dump butter also if you want, that's what I do.. its fucking awesome.

I serve with rice or mash potatoes, they soak up the butter nicely, screw eating healthy when your eating steak. MAN UP

Enjoy

I've found that it needs to be moist, have a crispy exterior and have a lot of flavor.  Here's what I've come up with:

(taken from http://cookawesome.blogspot.com/2012/11/chipotle-cheddar-cornbread.html )

Start preheating your oven to 425 degrees.  Oil up a cast iron pan and stick it in there as well to warm up.
Combine the following in a mixing bowl:
2c Cornmeal
1t Salt
1T Sugar (or honey)
2t Baking Powder
1/2t Baking Soda

Then mix the following separately
1c Buttermilk (or whole milk, or even almond milk)
2 eggs
1c Creamed Corn
Handful of corn kernels

Combine the two in the mixing bowl and integrate thoroughly.
Now is where I'll mix in the chipotle peppers, canadian bacon, cheddar cheese, etc.  The amount is up to you.
When the pan is smoking hot, pour in the batter and cook for 20 minutes.  If you wiggle the pan and the center jiggles, it's not done.  Insert a fork in the middle and make sure it comes out clean to be sure.  If your pan is well seasoned, and you oiled well, it should release easily once cooled.

1370573831.0	1fu6lg	Home-made Malibu on a Monarch budget: A guide to macerating your own liquors for fun and profit.	Googunk	68	18	11	"This guide will cover the art of alcoholic maceration and infusion.  If you’ve ever looked at a costly bottle of flavored booze and said to yourself “what’s with these prices? Isn’t this all just vodka and sugar-water?”  Well I have some good news and some bad news for you.  The good news is you are a better sleuth than you think; these spirits are in fact grain alcohol, sugar, and often chemical flavoring.  The bad news is you probably still paid for it anyways.

Well that is you no more.  Today you will grab your supplies and put together a home made liquor which rivals or dare I say bests anything you can find on the shelf.  You will be wealthier, tipsier, and better at giving gifts by the end of this guide.  All we will need is some booze, something to flavor it with, two mason jars, 4 weeks of patience, sugar, water, and some coffee filters.  That’s it.  I’d bet you have most of those things in your pantry already.  We begin with the pieces:

**Liquor :**

The vast majority of liquor used in maceration (infusing flavors) is vodka and rum, as these are mostly flavorless.  Occasionally, brandy or whiskeys may be used, but they have so much distinct flavor of their own that they seldom benefit from infusion.  Since the flavor added to the liquor will overshadow the subtleties of the base liquor, we will want to use a good liquor, but not a great one, it would be wasted in this application.  I usually just use Kirkland signature or Monarch.

For our example of homemade Malibu: I use Cruzan white rum.

**Proof/ABV:**
 
When it comes to proof, keep in mind that your proof will decrease because as you will have the same amount of alcohol in your mixture, but a greater volume.  As proof is a function of alcohol over volume, proof decreases as volume increases.  In any recipes I list here, 80 proof is fine, and probably within your budget.  Keep in mind that most flavored liquors or schnapps on the shelf are between 40 and 50 proof, and if you are attempting to mimic something in particular, you will likely end up close enough starting at 80 proof.  If you want your recipe to end at 80 proof you will need to counter your dilution of the alcohol and you can accomplish this by either adding everclear to compensate or simply starting with a 100-proof liquor, whichever may be more economical in your particular area.  Again, this part is optional; I would just add some more rum at the mixing phase if you really need it more alcoholic.

For our homemade Malibu: 80-proof is perfect

**Flavorant:**

I resist calling this “fruit” because you aren’t limited to fruit.  Anything with oil and/or sugar can be macerated in alcohol.  You just have to slice it thin.  I mean really thin.  In fact, don’t even call it slicing, this is shaving.  I strongly recommend using a mandolin slicer (er…shaver), as we want shavings so thin they’re translucent.  If you can’t see light through the membrane of the slice, it’s not thin enough.  The reason for this insistence on thinness is that we want to maximize surface area so the alcohol can extract the essence of the flavorant effectively.  We probably could just throw whole strawberries into the booze and get the same result if you waited for an entire year.  However, if you want this done in the 1 -4 week range, You’ll need the mandolin.  However, I know you well enough to know that you’re going to say “whatever, I can probably manage without the mandolin, they’re expensive and you said this project was going to save money”   Fine, you win, I did say that.  I hope you consider the investment of a mandolin but in the mean time you can alternatively use a vegetable peeler, but it’s going to take a lot longer and the slices won’t be quite as thin.  Whatever you do, DO NOT USE A FOOD PROCESSOR.  In most cases you will pulverize your flavorant and release the oils and flavors prematurely.  That makes for a flavorless and separated final product.

The best flavorants I’ve experimented with to agreeable results:  Ginger, hot peppers, lemon peel, coconut, strawberries, cherries, vanilla, instant coffee.

In most cases we next need to heat up the flavorant, in this case coconut.  Simply put 1/2 cup of water on to simmer with the coconut shavings for 15 minutes.  Let it cool, and then add it to your mason jars in equal portion.  We aren’t trying to toast the shavings, just warm them so they’re more ready to part with their oils.

Many recipes will call for you to add the sugar as this stage and simmer the coconut in simple syrup instead of water.  I choose not to do this for two very good reasons:  1.The sugar will mix in just fine after the maceration process and 2. We will later be filtering this through paper coffee filters and sugar jams the filter.  I spent 3 days filtering my first batch because of this.  If you wait until after the filtration to add sugar, the filtration takes about 1/10th as long.  

Our flavorant in the homemade Malibu obviously, is 1 small to medium coconut, shaved.  Save off the milk though, it doesn’t go into the booze.

**MACERATION:**

Maceration refers to placing a product in a cold solution to incorporate the flavors from the product into the solution.  In our case the product is coconut, and the solution is alcohol.  Were this done in a hot solution, it would be considered infusion.  The results are very different.  A lot of people like to talk about “infused” liquors but that’s a misnomer, it’s difficult to “infuse” alcohol, because all of the alcohol evaporates off in the process.  Infusion of alcohol would require a pressure cooker and a lot more effort than I intend to put forth.

To start your maceration, take your flavorant shavings and set them into a mason jar, now fill the mason jar with the alcohol until all of the flavorant is submerged.  Seal it up, and leave it for a few weeks.  The longer the better, but since the rate of flavor absorption slows over time, the sweet spot is 4 weeks.  Every couple of days, give the jar a shake to mix it up.  The mason jars you can find used at a thrift shop, but the lids are trickier, since they have a gasket on them you might have to buy those new.  Alternatively, since your concoction is alcoholic enough to ward off infection, you can use an old cleaned out spaghetti jar if you prefer.

**FULL RECIPE: COCONUT RUM**

1 small to medium coconut

1 750ml bottle white rum

(2) 1-quart mason jars or equivalent volume

Basket shape coffee filters

1 cup water

½ cup sugar

Remove meat from coconut, removing and setting aside the coconut milk.  If you’ve never opened a coconut before, go google how to before you hurt yourself.  Shave coconut meat into paper thin shavings.  Simmer coconut shavings in ½ cup water for 15 minutes or until tender.  Let cool, and then add coconut mixture in equal portion to mason jars.  Add white rum in equal portion to mason jars.  Close the jars and let sit in a dark place for at 1-4 weeks.  Longer is better.  Before bottling, taste the rum.  If more coconut flavor is desired, let sit longer and/or add ½ cup packaged shredded coconut.

Bottling day: 

Make simple syrup by stirring ½ cup water and ½ cup sugar over medium heat until dissolved.   Pour coconut mixture through a coffee filter which has been wetted with rum or vodka.  The best way is to drain the filtered product into another mason jar, since the volume is sure to fit and you didn’t really only own 2 mason jars did you?  The best way to hold said filter is to screw the coffee filter into a mason jar lid [like this](http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa238/killswitch71/Ecig%20Stuff/DIY%20and%20Extraction/Pecan%20Etxraction/IMAG0004.jpg).  Cover with the cap to avoid alcohol evaporation.  Alternatively you can place one coffee filter in a colander placed over a mixing bowl.  I dislike this method because the alcohol is left exposed and can partially evaporate.  Also, two filters in two mason jars will go twice as fast.

Add simple syrup to the mixture and mix thoroughly.  Return coconut rum to original bottle using a funnel.  Since volume increased, you will need an additional container, a mason jar again works fine.

Result will be milky and translucent, this is normal.  Do not assume additional filtration is needed.  Sometimes small floating globs of coconut oil will be present.  If shaking doesn't redistribute them, you can fish them out with a spoon.  Or just drink them, they aren't going to hurt.  This rum is now ready to drink immediately!

**Price comparison:**

In Seattle, WA on the day of this posting:

Bottle of Malibu: $18.48, 750ml, 42 proof

Batch of Googunk's homemade coconut rum: $13.26 (including coconut), 1L, 60 proof, and it tastes better.

Well look at that: it cost 29% less money, you got 33% more volume, and it’s almost 50% higher proof as well.  Even without considering the proof, this homemade coconut rum is about half the price of Malibu.

**MORE RECIPES**

Here’s the best part: it’s the same basic recipe for a bunch of other macerated flavored liquors, you just need to make a few minor tweaks and substitutions:

Limoncello: Use peel of 6-8 lemons for your flavorant, 100-proof vodka for your liquor (or add everclear).  Don’t simmer the lemon peel and there is no filtration required.  Put the product in the freezer for a sweet, cool, clean desert liquor beloved across Italy.

Ginger schnapps (hehehehe): Use flavorant of 2 oz ginger, peel of 1 orange, 1 split vanilla bean.  Use brandy or vodka for your liquor.  Brandy is better.  This one takes a long time to filter, be prepared to babysit it.

Apple Pie Moonshine – Flavorant is reduced unfiltered apple cider, reduced to about ½ original volume, add appropriate amount of everclear to yield about 30-60 proof.  You can just do the math in your head, this one is pretty loose with measurements.  This will probably be 1 handle of everclear per 2 ½ gallons of reduced apple cider (that is to say, 5 gallons which have been reduced to 2 1/2 gallons).  Bottle into 1 quart mason jars with a cinnamon stick and let it sit for 2-3 months.  We’re dissolving a cinnamon stick here, so it takes time.  Make it in fall when fresh cider is cheap, and enjoy it come winter.  Why 3 gallons?  The ingredient quantities are nice even numbers and this recipe is just exactly the amount that lasts me, my wife, my gift list, and any party guests the whole year.

Skittle bombs - Use two packs of skittles and 5 1/2-pint mason jars.  Segregate your skittle flavors (I know you do that already) into the separate jars.  Macerate in vodka for 1-2 weeks.  Shake up daily, these tend to settle and stick to eachother.  Do not simmer, but do filter.  You can now vomit the rainbow.

Kahlua (My favorite): Skip straight to the simple syrup phase, double the water and add 3 tablespoons of instant coffee to the syrup.   Quality doesn’t matter, I use Maxwell house.  Then mix that straight into 750ml of vodka with 1 tablespoon vanilla extract.  Don't cook the vanilla extract.  This one works fast so let sit for only about a week and it’s ready to drink.  No filtration required.  Do not leave out the sugar from this recipe.  This one does have a shelf life, but stored in the fridge and it will last about 3 months.

Oh, speaking of… Vanilla Extract: 6 split vanilla beans for flavorant, 750ml brandy or vodka.  No sugar or water.  Filter small portions out at a time into a small (50ml) bottle.  Leave the big bottle with the beans in your pantry to use as a refill bottle.  You can at any time top up by adding brandy or vodka to the refill bottle as needed for eternity.  The beans flavor the liquor, the liquor preserves the beans.  You now have a source of infinite real vanilla extract.  I’ve had the same bottle for years.

**A quick review of Dos and Don’ts**

**DO:**

- get a middle-shelf liquor

- Start with higher proof liquor or add everclear to end with a higher proof

- Thoroughly clean your mason jars to avoid contaminating flavors

- get a mandolin slicer if you plan to do this often

- save any sample size bottles so you can give this as gifts from now on.

- save the empty bottle during the maceration, so you have somewhere to put your product

- wet the coffee filters with vodka or your recipe's base liquor before filtering through them.

- test an idea with small batches before you make a whole bottle.  Mason jars do come in ½ pint

- In most cases, heat the flavorant in water before adding to the alcohol, especially if hard like coconut or ginger


**DON’T:**

-	Use the coconut milk in the rum for malibu

-	Use an already flavored liquor

- Use cone shaped coffee filters, they will burst at the seam.

-	Use the really expensive stuff

-	Use a food processor to slice

-	Expect it to be perfectly crystal clear, we aren't filtering it that much

-	Use bacon without directions, its tricky.

-	Use cheap or expired produce

-	Try to eat the post-maceration coconut, its tasteless

-	Add the sugar before the filtration

-	Spend way too much money for flavored liquor ever again"	t5_2qh56	True

My mother is going back to the motherland for a couple weeks and left me with my 2 brothers and 2 nephews (all boys) to take care of. I need some ideas that will, hopefully, expand their tastebuds as they've only ever had Chinese/Vietnamese food. They've never had stuff like pulled pork or sloppy joes! 

I'm an amateur chef but I have a fully stocked kitchen and cook every night for myself and often enough for my SO. 


Ideas I already have in mind are:

Butter chicken

BBQ Pulled pork sandwiches

Bulgogi

Kalbi

Meat loaf

Teriyaki chicken

Sloppy Joes

Pad Thai

Chili

Enchiladas 

Yes, they've never had these things before and I was amazed. They are teenage boys so they'll eat a lot of anything lol. Any ideas and/or recipes are much appreciated! They'll mainly require dinners since they eat lunch at school.

Added to list: Lasagna, tacos, chicken wings (buffalo and honey garlic flavours), kebabs, Beef Stroganoff, Shepard's pie, baked mac and cheese, currys (Japanese, Indian, Thai), baked ziti, carnitas, Tikki Masala, Chicken Biryani, Spaghetti (pesto, alfredo, Bolognese)

Thanks guys! Wow so many awesome suggestions. My mom's away for 6 weeks so I'll try and make as much as I can. Y'all are amazing! Hopefully they like it all!"	t5_2qh56	True

1 slice of onion (don't cry!)

Pepper, Italian Seasoning

Tapatio Hot Sauce (Yes, we're adding Tapatio. It's delicious.)

Mustard

Cream cheese

Cheddar cheese

 

--------------

Frying pan (because we all know you don't have a grill) on medium to medium/high heat. Whatever you feel like.

Empty the can of tuna of it's water/oil. Oilled is more delectable, but also more greasy. No, it's not dirty. Sicko.

Add the tuna, sliced onions, pepper, seasoning, and a few dashes of Tapatio (that shit's delicious) to the frying pan.

Slice the cheese. Thickly. Everyone likes cheese, even if they can't eat it. Flip/mix the tuna blend. Don't get too wild, you're making a mess, dammit.

Ok, that's better.

Put bread in the toaster.

Hopefully you've timed it just right so that the toast (no longer bread) pops out as soon as the tuna is done.

Mine did, because I'm unbelievably lucky like that.

Lay the cheddar on top of the tuna blend so it can melt. Mmmmm.

Put cream cheese and mustard onto the toast. On goes the tuna blend and cheesy goodness. Put the slices of toast together like two strangers shaking hands for the first time. Enjoy!"	t5_2qh56	True

It's pretty healthy to boot.  I'm submitting it as a single lady, so the recipe is for one, but it can obviously be doubled/tripled/quadrupled etc :)

The Fish (all measurements are approximate):

* 1 flounder filet (can be purchased as individually frozen filets in a multipack at Target -- cheaper!)

* 1 egg (or 1/4 c. egg substitute)

* olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of a med. frying pan)

* 1/2 c. flour

* 1 c. Parmesan cheese

* salt/pepper (optional)

* Lawry's seasoned salt (optional)

1. Combine the flour, Parmesan, and seasonings in a Ziploc bag, seal and shake to mix.  
2. Heat the frying pan on med-high heat and add the olive oil. 
3. Beat the egg in a small bowl and dip the fish in, being sure to cover it completely.
4. Place the egg-coated filet in the bag of flour/cheese/seasonings, seal, and shake to coat.
5.  Once the oil has begun to bubble a little bit, place the fish in the pan and cook it in the oil for 2 minutes on each side.
6.  Turn off heat, remove fish from pan and place on paper towels to allow some of the oil to drain off without soaking your plate

The 'Taters:

* 1 medium red potato

* 2 T. olive oil

* garlic, salt, and pepper (to taste)

1.  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.  Cut the potato lengthwise into halves, and then the halves in half again.  Then cut the quarters in half widthwise.
3.  Place the pieces in a small bowl, drizzle them with olive oil and season to taste.  Toss the potatoes to coat them in the oil.
4.  Lay a piece of parchment paper over a cookie sheet.  Put the potatoes on the parchment paper.
5. Place cookie sheet in oven and roast for 15 minutes.

The Veggies:

* 1/4 c. sugarsnap peas

* 1/4 c. fresh green beans

1.  De-string the peas and chop the ends off of the green beans.  Chop the beans in half if you feel they're too long.
2.  Boil water in a saucepan, add the beans/peas and boil for 2 minutes, until the veggies are just tender.

**TIP:** I start the potatoes first, then with 10 mins left on the timer I get the veggie water boiling and the fish set up.  Everything finishes at around the same time!"	t5_2qh56	True

1347563146.0	zu49v	Cajun Jambalaya	tr1ppn	75	25	49	"I had said the other day I was going to post my jambalaya recipe, and I didn't have time. So, I'm going to post it now and see what everyone else thinks. This is definitely a small project to make, but the end result (to me, anyway) is good enough to eat it for multiple meals on multiple days. Also note, this recipe makes a LOT of food.

Ingredients:
Cooking oil (enough to fry up meat and vegetables)

1lb pork sausage (I like using hot, but any will do)

1lb shrimp (small enough to be bite sized. de-tailed)

8oz crab meat (or faux crab. optional. I love it)

1 onion, diced

1 green bell pepper, diced

1/2 cup diced celery hearts

1-2 cloves garlic, chopped

cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp, or to taste)

cajun seasoning (like creole (1 tsp or to taste)

salt and pepper (to taste)

2 cups uncooked white rice

4 cups beef stock

3 bay leaves

2 tsp Worcestershire sauce (or to taste)

1tsp hot sauce (medium hot)


In a large pot, heat oil on medium-high and cook sausage until lightly browned. Add in shrimp and crab meat until soft. Stir in onion, green pepper, garlic, cayenne pepper, and cajun seasoning until soft/onion is yellow and translucent.

Stir in rice, add beef stock and bay leaves. Cook to a boil. Reduce heat and cover, stirring occasionally. Simmer until rice is tender (about 20 minutes) (almost all of the beef stock will cook off). Add in Worcestershire and hot sauce. Stir and serve. 

Some people also like to add a can of stewed tomatoes to this (it goes in right before the rice), but since I don't care for them, I don't add them. Enjoy!

Edit: A few people have mentioned that this isn't jambalaya, and a few have even taken offense. My apologies for that. It's more ""jambalaya""; quotes included. Closer to jambalaya with no seafood, chicken stock, and some cut up pork chops or chicken. Thanks to everyone for the correction! "	t5_2qh56	True
