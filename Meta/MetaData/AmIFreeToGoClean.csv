1367958146.0	1dvu7c	US border patrol can eat a dick!	JohnnyDrama68	156	9	117	"OK time to rant.

Today I went over to Canada via Detroit for the first time since before 9/11.

Crossing into Canada I was greeted pleasantly, asked a couple of standard questions and told to have a nice visit.

Coming home a few hours later on the US side, things got really fun.

Asked a couple standard questions then told to open my trunk. No big deal. He looks then tells me I need to go to secondary.

Ok no big deal, as I have done nothing wrong, it's random right?

When parking in secondary I am told to take only my ID and wallet and money with me, leave everything else, including cell phone.

I ask why I can't take my phone and am told it is not allowed. So that kills my chance to record the encounter.

Go inside and the woman at the desk asks me the same questions I was already asked outside. I answer politely just to get through the process and be on my way. 

I'm told to have a seat. About 15 minutes later another officer calls me over to empty my pockets, which I do to once again, just get through the process.

Told once again to have a seat.

Another 15 minutes go by and the fist woman is holding my cell phone and tells me to give her my passcode at which point I tell her no. She tells me I have to, and I reply ""there is nothing on that phone that could constitute a crime so no I won't do it.""

A supervisor comes over and politely informs me that they are allowed to search everything and anything when crossing into the US. I tell him that it's ridiculous that I as an American citizen am being treated like a terrorist or criminal for no reason. No reasonable suspicion of any wrongdoing. He tells me I can enter the code if I like but I can't leave until they go through my phone, or I can leave without it.

I know they have a pretty broad authority to do whatever they please at the border so rather than fight a losing battle, I enter the code. I have never wished this before, but I really would have liked to have a couple pics of my dick for her to see. If I was only that type of guy to do that! LOL

So she walks away with my phone and I tell the supervisor that It is disgusting that they treat people like they do. I answered everything they asked, was not nervous or sketchy in any way. I asked how long this would take and he told me, I can't really answer that. I again asked, ""well lets say you search every single thing, every nook and cranny of my car, etc, how long because I have shit to do""

He says maybe an hour. So I sit back down growing more irritated every minute that passes.

Finally after about an hour they call me up and hand me my ID and tell me I am free to go. Then another officer calls my name and asks me "" Were you driving on 696 last night about 9:30? I look at him and say Sorry, I was at home on my couch."" He then asks me again, "" Are you sure about that"" At this point I've had enough, I look him dead in the eye and say "" Didn't I just tell you I wasn't, are you retarded?"" HE says ""don't get irate, I say your car on 696 last night about 9:30"". I laugh at him and say whatever dude, hows it feel to think  you sniffed out a crime and then find absolutely nothing, must feel pretty stupid huh?"" Now there are like 5-6 people sitting around waiting their turn to be harassed and they start giggling at our exchange.

I walk out and yell out VIVA USA land of the free!

There's really only two or three phrases you ever need to say during an encounter. The first, and the one you are probably going to need to repeat (calmly and assertively), is, ""I'm not going to answer that.""

Officer: Hello.
Citizen: Hello.
Officer: Do you have an ID on you?
Citizen: I'm not going to answer that.
Officer: Really? Why not?
Citizen: I'm not going to answer that.
Rinse. Repeat.

Do not ask questions. Do not ask the officer if you are required to show ID (this is the most common error I see). Don't say you 'mean no disrespect'. Don't say you have nothing to hide. Don't even ask if you're free to go. If you want to leave, start walking away (slowly). If you're being detained, you will either be told to stop or you will be physically (nothing major, probably an tap on the shoulder or a mild arm grab) stopped. At that point, say: I do not consent to any searches or seizures of my person or my property and I am invoking my right to remain silent.

Then shut up. No really: shut up. Let me be clear: make your bottom lip touch your top lip. Shut the fuck up.

Don't ask questions. Don't cite Supreme Court cases. Just sit/stand there silently and be patient. If you must: think of the sweet smell of dollar bills after settling a false detainment/arrest lawsuit.

1376069232.0	1k1cr1	When a cop breaks the law and unlawfully detains you, or does anything else unlawful, you should file a criminal complaint, just like they do against you when you break the law.	CaptainRob	95	14	20	"Just my opinion, take it or leave it, but I think you should file a criminal complaint against any officer that violates your rights.  And here's how I would go about that:

First, when placed in a situation in which an LEO (law enforcement Officer) violates your rights you should realize that the LEO is no longer acting as an LEO.  The law would not allow for itself to violate the law.  Therefore if an officer is no longer an officer, they are then just persons doing criminal acts.  As such, you should file criminal complaints against the person.  Don’t complain to the department (that's like complaining to a company that you didn't like things).  I mean a real criminal complaint in which charges are brought up against the person for a criminal act.  You can attempt to do this at the police station (though I've never been successful this way), but you'll usually find that you get further by going to your county courthouse and either A) speaking with the district attorney, B) Taking your criminal complaints to a judge, or C) taking your criminal complaints directly to the grand jury.  


First, Criminal Complaints usually aren't something reserved for an LEO to fill out.  Most states have it written in their code that anyone can file a criminal complaint and they also usually have the specifics of how it has to be written.  You just type one up on your computer at home, make sure it’s accurate, sign it and get it notarized, or take it to a DA and sign it right in front of them.  That usually does the trick as far as how to write a criminal complaint.  Make sure you have a real criminal charge written in, not “he told me I couldn’t do what I have a right to do and wasn’t free to go” (unlawful detainment) or whatever, instead say something like, “... did then and there, unlawfully and illegally knowingly restrain Affiant in his liberty by threat of armed and/or deadly force through exhibition of a deadly weapon, under color of authority committing the crime of unlawful restraint”.  I’m talking about real penal code violation crimes: assault, aggravated assault, abuse of official capacity, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, criminal trespass, etc.  Look up penal codes in your state and see what best fits the situation.  Then type it up, read it, re-read it, have your friends read it, and make sure it all looks right before you go to hand it in to either A, B, or C.


**A)** DA's don't want to file criminal complaints against officers.  Usually though you will find that your state has some rule in their Code of Criminal Procedures (or whatever they call it in your state) that says a DA has no authority to disregard a criminal complaint and must act upon it when notified of such.  They will usually give you some kind of runararound and I really haven't had a lot of luck here either but it's a far better option than going to the police headquarters and sometimes you get real DA's that want to uphold the law (the Harvey Dent’s of the real world).


**B)** Judges usually have the same kind of rules that DA's have about being notified of criminal complaints and having to act upon it.  Because we have open courts you should be allowed to go into the courtroom and in between cases hand over to the judge the criminal complaint and make your complaint known.  Bailiffs will usually help get you in front of the judge if you are just walking in for the first time.  Just motion to the bailiff to come over to you and whisper to him something about wanting to turn in the criminal complaints to the judge and answer any questions the judge may have and wait for your turn.  Something like that should work.  I haven't really had a lot of good outcome this way either but I have gotten official mail back from the judge recognizing the complaints were turned in, and recognizing the judge accepted them.  (this is a key point for later if you want)


**C)** Grand Juries.  Every state is different but a lot have rules for grand juries that say they have to be accessible to the public in some way or another.  As such, not only can DA's and LEO's go before Grand Juries but concerned citizens can take complaints directly to the Grand Jury as well.  Usually this is for when there's a corrupt DA (because what DA is going to take a criminal complaint for themselves before the Grand Jury) but there are other reasons as well.  If your state allows this, then you can attempt to take your complaints directly to the Grand Jury.  There they will decide if there is enough information to investigate and possibly indict.  This is the most surefire way to make sure justice is done.


Now, if you first take your complaints to the DA and the Judge and they say they can’t/won’t do anything about it AND your state happens to have rules that say something like they “SHALL” act upon these things, then your DA and Judge just failed to perform their duties and there’s usually some kind of crime associated with that, (Something like: Abuse of Official Capacity, Criminal Conspiracy, Tampering with Government Record, Official Oppression, Impersonating Public Servant, Simulating Legal Process, etc).  SO, if you can get the DA or Judge to break the law, then you have a REAL case.  And then “Shit’s about to get real”.  Now it’s time to write a criminal complaint charging them with a crime and then you have some real ammunition.


So, I’m not for screwing over the DA, the judge, or the cop unless they really are corrupt.  Usually it’s a case of the cop having a big head and thinking he can do things he can’t.  This process is meant to scare the hell out of these guys and make them learn and make their friends on the force learn that they aren’t given a “get out of jail free card” just because they have a badge.  Now, USUALLY the cops are just acting outside their legal bounds, but sometimes you get a real criminal in a police uniform that completely deserves to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and these methods are the methods that should help make that happen if the police won’t police themselves.

As to the DA and Judge, I can’t blame them for not wanting to poke the hornet’s nest called the police department but that’s their job sometimes and they have that responsibility.  I don’t want a judge to lose their seat unless they really are corrupt, but sometimes it doesn’t hurt to have a real and viable threat to make things happen the way they should. Same with DA’s.  It’s called leverage.  Don’t be afraid to force them to work as public servants, and don’t be afraid to spread their misdeeds to things like the local news, mayor, city council, Attorney General, Governor, etc.


And that’s my opinion of how to handle LEO’s that decide to break the law.  I'm sure there are those on here who will disagree with me, but I've seen this tactic work and if the laws are there, why not turn the tables on an aggressive police force by holding them to the same accountability?  And don't forget ignorance of the law is no excuse (even for cops).

There’s a whole other side to this which is civil court, but first I think real criminal charges need to be filed.  Bad cops need to be taken off the force.  Good cops need to see that crime doesn't pay.  And shady cops need to learn from the example to straighten up.  Every state is different in these rules, but the general ideas are the same throughout.  You'll just have to look up your state specifics.  And by all means, don't forget to try the civil suit side as well, which if you get a successful criminal conviction will only help your case.

My daughter's boyfriend came to pick her up . He walked up to our front door upset because a gray Tahoe had been following him around, and he asked my daughter if they looked familiar--she didn't know who they were either. He and my daughter left and the car continued to follow him throughout the neighborhood, with every turn he made. He got scared so he sped away from them trying to evade them.  He (stupidly) decided to go through a red light to see if they would follow. It was then that gray Tahoe turned on their lights, jumped out the car screaming to get out the car with his hands up, tackled him down on the street FOR NO FUCKING REASON OTHER THAN THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE!
He was frightened but very respectful, he's in the National Guard and knows how to deal with authority. They yelled at him, asking why did he run from them. He replied that he did not know that they were police officers. They hauled him to jail where he was kept until he posted $900 bond for running red lights and speeding!

1363750885.0	1an4ut	Short story about how cops enter homes without warrants.	divs_pl	71	11	34	"I lived on the second floor of a two story home, below me there were some girls living who were running a ""massage service"" which I technically knew about but that was only because of my ""suspicions.""  
One day I hear the doorbell in the back of the house (We both share one rear entry to the main part of the house right across from the girls' front door. I saw a bunch of cops outside so I slightly opened the door and squeezed out.  
Here was their shitty tactic: The one cop up front was standing so close to the door that I wasn't able to close it behind me and basically forced me to step back in.  
They asked me if I knew if there was a business down here that I knew about and I said no, I'm not aware of anything. He kept on stepping closer into me until there was enough room behind him for 3 other officers to step inside.  
I said something like ""Woah, do you have a warrant? I don't feel safe around so many guns can you please step outside?""  
The cops ignored me and not only walked into the basement, walked upstairs to my apartment and one of them was trying to unlock the girl's door.  
The whole time the first big cop basically cornered me while asking me bullshit questions and telling me that unless I'm hiding something I have nothing to worry about.  
The girls weren't home (They were usually there in the mornings and some came back late at night) so I told the cop that the people living there were not home and to come back with a warrant and to please get out of my house. He asked me if I was the owner (I was 17 at the time, of course I didn't own the fucking building)  
I finally pulled out my phone and asked the big cop for his badge number, he quickly said it and started backing out and all the cops left.  
When they were out the door I said that I will need all their names and they basically told me to fuck off and left.  
TL;DR: Big cop cornered me and pushed me into my house while his buddies followed and took a look around the inside.

After that there was some drama on the Cincinnati Police Department's (CPD) Facebook page, and the Chief of Police [issued a statement there](http://www.facebook.com/CincinnatiPolice/posts/10151837980486040) addressing the [criticism](http://www.wcpo.com/dpp/news/local_news/cincinnati-police-chief-james-craig-tlcs-police-women-of-cincinnati-had-staged-content), in part by saying the incident had been staged.

On one of the reposts /u/supercore23 and /u/bluesedge pointed out this fact, which made me curious [to find out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmIFreeToGo/comments/1csih0/4th_amendment_being_violated_on_tv/c9ki7b3) what one of these investigations looks like. I submitted an [open records request](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1u1ThPDeZXvY2hrajFtX2pKd1U/edit?usp=sharing).

[Here are all the documents produced by CPD in response](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1u1ThPDeZXvYVg5RzF5a0V0bEk&amp;usp=sharing).

I just gave them a quick glance, and hopefully more informed subreddit members
will comment, but here are a few notes:

* It appears that commentors who noticed the door being dented were correct. The property
manager submitted a request to have it replaced. CPD replaced it and counseled Officer Hesselbrock (nee Curtiss, the female officer). That's the only disciplinary action related to the incident that I can see.
* The obstruction arrest appears to have been for failure to identify. They walked him off camera, ran his ID, and cut him loose once he apologized and began 'fully cooperating' with them.
* My reading of the record doesn't support the Chief's statement that ""I initiated the above mentioned review of the incident"". The anonymous complaint that initiated the investigation was dated 1 January 2012.
* There was an earlier complaint dated 4 March 2011 (shortly after it aired). There's no information on whether it was ever investigated in this file.
* I didn't redact or alter the documents in any way. They are exactly as I received them. They're public records, so I hope moderators will take that into account if there's an issue. 

There you have it, in case anyone else was curious.

If a cop won't give me a simple yes or no answer, what are my rights and legal obligations?

As I understand the law, if a cop can't or won't tell me what crime I am suspected of committing, I am under no legal obligation to identify myself (I live in Connecticut and we have no stop and identify statue. Do your homework and know your local laws!).

As I understand the law, if I ask if I am being detained and do not receive a straightforward ""yes"", I am free to leave.

So my question is this: at what point do we start to use force against force? At what point do we say enough is enough? At what point do we protect our fellow citizen against the crimes that are being perpetrated against them by the very people who they look to for protection?

A man walks up to me with a badge and a gun and says that I can't say what I want to say, that I can't bear arms, that I can't assemble and that he can take my property anytime he wants. When do I tell him that he is in for a fight?

""All citizens of the United States of America have a right to pass and re-pass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in their own state."" Smith v. Turner, 48 US 283 (1849).

""For a crime to exist, there must be an injured party. There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of this exercise of Constitutional rights."" Sherar v. Cullen, 481 F. 945.

The Fourth Amendment says one cannot be disturbed in their peace. Use of emergency lights, which is a felony when there is no emergency, is a disturbance of one's peace. Cases are dismissed on that alone.

""The Fourth Amendment forbids stopping a vehicle even for the limited purpose of questioning its occupants unless police officers have a founded suspicion of criminal conduct."" United States v. Salinas. United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, citing United States v. Ramirez-Sandoval, (1989).

""Even assuming that purpose is served to some degree by stopping and demanding identification from an individual without any specific basis for believing he is involved in criminal activity, the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment do not allow it. When such a stop is not based on objective criteria, the risk of arbitrary and abusive police practices exceeds tolerable limits."" Delaware v. Prouse 440 U.S, 648, 653 (1979).

Founded suspicion exists when an officer is aware of specific articulable facts, that, together with rational inferences drawn from them, reasonably warrant a suspicion that the person to be detained has committed or is about to commit a crime. United States v. Cortez, (1981); United States v. Robert L., (1989).

If you know good 4th amednment and criminal defense attorneys in San Mateo County, CA, or want to contribute funds, please contact me by PM.

Background:

While walking back from work and towards her home a few blocks away, ""Jane"" a single mom in her fifties, crossed the street. Before reaching the other side, a police car pulled up on the sidewalk in front of her and two officers emerged. 

As they approached they said something to the effect of ""it's illegal to cross the street there where there is no sidewalk, do you have ID?"". Jane said ""I don't have ID on me"", at which time, without further words or any struggle, she was turned around and her hands were cuffed behind her back and she was put inside the patrol car.

 For several minutes, as they drove her further away from home and out of the area she asked several times ""Where are you taking me?"". She only got mocking laughter from one of the officers in response.

She was taken to a station, booked, slammed against a wall, and generally roughed up a bit, leaving her with bruises (I have asked her to take photos). 

She was held for 12 hours, with no phone call, no lawyer, no nothing. Finally, just before 5am, she got home after a horrific night, with a charge of PC148(a)(1) of obstruction/resisting and her promise to appear to face that charge in court in a few weeks.

Jaywalking can land you in jail for 12 hours, with your family frantically searching for you, while you are roughed up and then released with trumped up charges.

I'm furious and I'm not letting them get away with it."	t5_2ve29	True

1358487634.0	16sw6v	My First AmIFreeToGo Encounter	318100dy	49	9	31	"On Monday night I was out with a friend and at some point we were walking outside of a bar in downtown Austin and a gang of police swarmed upon us. Here's how it went down:
Cop #1 snagged me and asked me to ""come over here"" 
Me: Is this a voluntary encounter?
Cop#1: No, you are being detained. You got ID?
Me: Sure
Cop#1: Can I see it?
Me: No thanks.
Cop#1: You don't want to show me your ID?
Me: No thanks. I do not consent to this encounter, I do not consent to any questions or searches, please don't ask me any questions. What is your name and badge number?
Cop#1: Speaks his name and badge number - Why don't you want to answer any questions?
Me: Please don't ask me any questions. I have invoked my fourth and fifth amendment rights, rights which you are sworn to defend on my behalf. Please articulate the suspicion you have that gives you grounds for detaining me.
Cop#1: Sit down right there.
Me: Is that a lawful order?
Cop#1: Yes. Wait right there.
Me: I would like to go on my way. Am I free to go?
Cop#1: No you are being detained.
Me: What am I suspected of?
Cop#1: Wait right there...

Now I'm sitting on the concrete and it's freezing cold. I began recording the police as they hassled my friend. I also texted my lawyer telling him I was being illegally detained. At some point I showed cop#1 the text that I had sent my lawyer, which stated I was being illegally detained. I also told him I was recording.

After some more time I started getting really freezing cold and I said to the cop#1 that I would show him my license if he would let me go freely on my way and he intelligently picked up on the potential that question contained and he said  that I already said I did not want to show my ID so that wouldn't be necessary.

This went on for an hour or more. The cops took my friend around the corner where I could not see him and eventually arrested him. I didn't know what they arrested him for but found out later they charged him with DWI. The fact is that he was neither driving, being in his car nor anywhere near his car. 

During this encounter another cop came over, a bigger fatter more stupid looking one, and demanded my ID which I refused and he seemed like he was about to further violate my civil rights but cop#1 took him aside and schooled him on the law for a second (cop#1 was pretty civil in his general disposition).

Some time went by and I started getting really cold, not being dressed for the freezing temperature and not being able to move around and keep warm.

So after an hour or so, cop#1 came up to me and said I needed to call someone and get a ride because I was intoxicated - he said this clearly because he was at a loss for any reason to have detained me. I was not intoxicated. I said I would just get a ride to the saloon and wait for my wife to pick me up. He said I couldn't go to another bar because I was intoxicated. He said I either had to get in a cab or he would take me to jail. I said if he thought he could take me to jail then he should do that. He said he didn't want to (bullshit). I eventually got in a cab and went to the saloon and waited for my wife.

I know those cops would have arrested me for no reason based on their arrest everyone policy. I know they didn't arrest me because they could tell that I have on board legal services and they could possibly end up having to go through the motions of being investigated for their conduct. 

Still, the policy they have is to uniformly disregard the rights of the people and they certainly did illegally detain me. I am feeling out a Title 42 1983 complaint - not to be aggressive towards cop#1, but the policy in general. Overall Cop#1 was polite and seemed intelligent. It seemed like he felt he was over a barrel having initiated this encounter. 

I think my friend was probably arrested as a direct result of things he said to the police as they badgered him. Neither of us were drunk to the point of being ""intoxicated"".

TLDR: AmIFreeToGo saved me from wrongful arrest and it's pretty much here where I learned about it.

**Officer:** Where are you coming from tonight?

**Me:** I'm not going to answer that.

**Officer:** Have you been drinking?

**Me:** I'm not going to answer that.

**Officer:** Why not?

**Me:** Because you've pulled me over without probable cause.

At this point the officer got kind of huffy, mumbled something about this being an OVI checkpoint, and said something to another officer.  A moment later he was back at my window.

**Officer:** Can I see your ID?

I complied.  Should I have?  Am I legally required to?  This is Ohio.

**Officer:** Why are your hands shaking?

**Me:** I do that when I'm nervous.

He shined his flashlight around my car one last time, and told me I was free to go.

Finally, I carry my laminated ACLU membership card and the phone numbers for my local chapter of the ACLU and the National Lawyers Guild helpline.

1370820210.0	1g0d3z	Canadian Border patrol asked for my phone's password and looked through my phone and email - rights?	private_p	45	4	81	"Hi everyone. I found this subreddit while searching for information on my rights. A few weeks ago I decided to take a short day trip to Canada. I was taking a trip both to visit a friend and to see if I could fill an RX, both of which are totally legal. When asked at the border, I said I was going to see a friend. After being probed further, I answered truthfully that I met the friend online, but a very long time ago as a teenager. I've met her in person several times since.

Apparently just saying ""internet"" was some huge red flag, and they proceeded to detain me for over 30 minutes. After some time they asked for me to unlock my phone. I was really shocked and asked them if it was necessary or even legal to do so, to which they replied, ""This is the border patrol - we can do anything"". Since I didn't want to create trouble I unlocked the phone and they searched through my email and god knows what else. I was very shaken after the event.

I'm trying to get information on whether this was legal. I don't think they can actually legally ask me to surrender the phone's password, but I didn't want to be detained. I've developed some fear of traveling again over this. I'm not exactly a demographic that I think would be singled out, but I do not want it to happen again. For example, if I had drained or disposed of the battery of my phone/laptop/etc. and not had a charger with me, would this be a safeguard? I'm not saying it would in the case that I was some internationally known hacker, but as a skinny white girl, would ""Oh, the battery's dead, sorry"" be enough to make them just forget about it?

Is there a wiki somewhere about how to say the right things as to not trigger the border patrol? In addition to that, they started prying with some unnecessary and embarrassing questions about my employment, health issues, etc. On my way back I hedged about the question of where I knew my friend, and it went a lot more smoothly. I'm traveling to Europe later in the year and honestly this was very traumatic for me, and would like things to go better."	t5_2ve29	True

1362272241.0	19jvdg	The Decoy Camera	marvborg	40	4	11	"I often find myself driving and walking alone, while going to and from work. At those times, if I need to video record to protect myself, I use two cameras, one obvious and one somewhat covert. 

The ""covert"" camera is really no more covert than necessary. If I'm walking it's a mini camera clipped to the flap of a shirt or jacket pocket. In a car, it is a pair of dashcams, one facing inwards, mounted on the edge of the windscreen and behind the GPS.

For the obvious and ""active"" camera I use my phone, with a remote upload or streaming app and I make it very very obvious by holding it up in my hand pointed straight out and following the action. 

The idea is to draw as much attention as possible to the active camera, so as to distract from the secondary camera, almost like a sleight of hand. I tested it recently and people seem so focused on the lens in their face they completely miss the second camera. 

In the end, I either get dramatic footage of a seizure from the non-seized camera, or two angles for editing a nice video.

Anyone else tried this? Any thoughts or experiences?"	t5_2ve29	True

This stems from a dispute with my landlord. They demanded that I produce photo
ID to collect a package held in their office. Being the petulant ass that I am,
I told them to go pound sand and walked out with it. 

About three hours later, I
had just sat down to dinner when officer A. knocked on my front door. I didn't open it, and
instead went to the window and told A. that ""I have nothing to say to you.""
A. replied ""Well, I have something to say to you.""

He continued to ask me whether I had taken any package and whether it was mine.
I said something to the effect of ""goodnight officer, please leave,"" and returned
to my dinner. He started pounding on the door with his flashlight or baton. I
turned on my smartphone, started recording video, and tried to keep eating and keep my family calm. They
were getting agitated as he continued pounding on the door. The backup officer
(B.) arrived and
the pounding became more insistent. My mother went to the window and B.
threatened her with arrest unless she opened the door. He said something to the
effect of ""we're waiting on the detectives to get here with a search warrant,
and we'll kick in your door and take everyone inside to jail."" She got even more
upset and then opened the door. 

I went outside and began speaking to the
officers. That's all on tape.  We began conversing and I gave them my statement.
They again demanded to see the package and threatened to kick in my door.  Being
the petulant ass that I am, I got a little indignant when they threatened to
arrest everyone and refused to show them the package. They told me I was being
detained and handcuffed me. I lost control of my phone and was separated from it
as B. led me downstairs.

When we got downstairs, out of range of the camera, B. asked me my name
again. Because I was detained I gave it to him. He asked my for my date of birth
and I tried to ignore him. He pressed on, and threatened to arrest me and have
me booked as a John Doe. I told him that if I were arested that I'd be obliged
to give him all required booking information. Around this time my mother showed
A. my package carton and the landlord's agent confirmed that it was the same
package, and that it did have my name on it. He again demanded my DOB and again
threatened to arrest me, and said that I was making things harder when all I had
to do was show him the package since it was mine anyway. I told him that if the
package wasn't mine I definitely shouldn't have shown it to him. 

He walked me
over to his cruiser and again asked me for my DOB, warning me that he'd arrest
me for obstruction if I didn't. I again refused. He asked me if I was ""a lawyer
or something,"" and A. asked whether I was in law school. I gave no reply.
B. again warned me, and asked for my DOB, I again refused. This went back
and forth for a minute, and at one point I asked him ""Well, am I under arrest?""
and he said ""Yes, you are under arrest"" I said something like ""I guess we'll see
you in federal court,"" and finally gave him my birthday. He tightened my cuffs
and went to run my information. At some point my brother brought me my shoes.

He asked me to confirm my SSN, and I complied since I was already under arrest.
He conferred with his partner for a few minutes and came back. At one point,
after I had refused to answer one of his questions A. turned to B. and
said ""421-A?"" (MENTALLY ILL PERSON) and he replied, ""Yeah, he's 421-A."" B. asked A. if he
wanted to take me, (I wasn't clear, but there was some issue with shift change,
perhaps) and they discussed it some more out of my hearing. B. came back
and told me that I had the option of taking the citation instead of taking me
into custody. I told him that I'd sign any citation. 

A. left to write it and
complete his report and the citation. During this time I discussed personal
reading habits, Officer B. offered a favorable recommendation of the Harry
Potter and Dan Brown series. A. presented the citation and released me from
handcuffs. I signed and asked if I was free to go. B. responded that I
was, and I bid the officers a good evening.

### Citation
The charge was [Obstructing a public
officer](http://www.socratek.com/statelaws.aspx?id=157605&amp;title=nrs%20197.190%20obstructing%20public%20officer),
and the citation read:

&gt;Did willfully hinder, delay or obstruct a public officer, [A.] and [B.] of the
LVMPD in the lawful discharge of his official duties of investigating a
burglary/petit larceny call by refusing to open door or show the package that
was taken.

Municipal court in July.

### Questons/notes

Not gonna post the video just yet... talked way too much, and generally
comported myself like a petulant ass. Questions:

1. Why am I such a petulant ass? (Rhetorical.)
2. Where to begin? Essentially destitute, so even assuming I beat the charge
with appointed counsel,
suing seems like a long shot. Do people take contingency for these? I'd give up
99% if I thought someone would see it through.
3. Jeez, that shit is **so** much harder than it looks. It's easy to pretend
we'd all be stony-faced pillars of silence, but once people start yelling and
emotions run high it's another story entirely. I barely remembered to start
recording. Probably would have been easier if I had actually committed some
crime; the motivation to talk my way out of it was just too strong.
4. That said, even the small talk about books while waiting for the citation
gave him enough to make a pretty mordant observation about my motivations. You
really can't say anything to them.

### Update

That's a lot of comments. Opinion seems 60/40 that I'm a douche. Probably correct. Also been brought to my attention that I was dickish in some replies. If I did it to you, I apologize. I'm in the wilderness and grateful for any perspective that'll help make sense of this. I'm thankful for all constructive comments.

**Lawyer #1:** Largish firm, good SEO, which is how I found them. Probably better ways to pick, but I don't know anyone who's ever needed an attorney and haven't got the foggiest idea of how to select one. Nice enough, told them the story, but they weren't interested in seeing the video, which may or may not be a bad sign. Anyway, they explained the calendar and process, the different stages, including the pre-trial conference. He doesn't expect that they'll nolle prosse the charges, and the best I can expect is dismissal contingent on completing anger management, $200-$300 fine, and 40 hours of community service. $1000 flat-rate. I didn't bother to mention the possibility of  a 1983 suit, which seems pretty remote. Seems like I'd might as well go with the appointed attorney if that's the best I can expect. Will try to get a second opinion tomorrow.

tl;dr: I'm pretty hosed.

#### Video
Fuck it, I ~~going to post~~ put the video in [a separate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmIFreeToGo/comments/1ehjlr/video_refused_to_answer_my_door_and_submit_to/). I'll edit out my family, so it'll be just my conversation with the officers. The consensus is that I'm totally responsible for how it went down, and I agree.

When I get there I end up sitting in our ""waiting"" room for about 15 minutes, having no idea what is going on. My vice principal comes to get me and escorts me to his office. When we get there, there is a truancy officer ""aka Rent-a-Cop"" sitting in a chair in the corner of the room (this is unusual.) 

They ask me if I sold any drugs to 'Tom' yesterday. I said no. Both of them start asking me questions and saying that if i I was I would be going to Juvi. 

This is when my vice principal asks me to take off my shoes, pull up my shirt, and give him my bag. I tell him that he has no right and that I don't consent to any searches. The Rent-a-Cop said that my vice principal needs a lot less probable cause then he would. My vice principal says that a ""trustworthy"" student told him I was pushing dope. 

Okay, whatever I don't have drugs on me anyways. I do as he asks and empty my pockets, take off my shoes, and proceed to be patted down  by my vice principal. They find nothing but eye drops and try and tell me it's paraphernalia (I know better.) 

I feel that the search conducted was illegal, because he was taking one students word over mine. Am I right or was the search perfectly legal? I'm sorry if this is in the wrong sub, it's the best one I could think of."	t5_2ve29	True

But the judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said officers were routinely stopping people outside the buildings without reasonable suspicion that they were trespassing.

1375939606.0	1jxsoj	A discussion about post content.	FreedomsTorch	34	6	16	"I take a very, very relaxed approach to moderation. I err on the side of permissiveness. The vast majority of content I remove is racist hate speech that doesn't add to the conversation. I and the other moderators tend to let most other things slide and rely on you, the community, to keep things in check. In fact, we have AutoModerator set up to be about as permissive as possible so things don't get caught up in the spam filter.

The rest of the moderation team didn't seek out their positions. I made [rondeline](http://www.reddit.com/user/rondeline) a moderator because of outstanding contribution early on in this sub's life. Without that contribution, I really think this sub would've died an early death like so many other dead subs.

[Myte342](http://www.reddit.com/user/Myte342) and [brerrabbitt](http://www.reddit.com/user/brerrabbitt) were made moderators as a result of a contest I initiated to add to the roster when the sub began growing and had very little coverage. They didn't win because they were seeking the status, but because they too were excellent content submitters who simply continued to make this sub worthy of your audience.

What's my point? 

I'm not able to moderate all that much. The other moderators aren't expected to be on top of things like white on rice. More than that, it kind of goes against the very idea of this sub to engage in heavy-handed moderation. So far it's worked pretty well, but we're starting to see cracks as our growth continues and becomes more self-sustaining. 

We've seen many comments and received some direct contact with sentiments that a large portion of the posted content is off-topic and better suited for [r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/). I can only speak for myself, but I agree. 

This sub was specifically created to focus on knowing, exercising and upholding our rights. 

From the sidebar:

&gt;Please keep posts inside the following guidelines:

&gt;- Examples of police officers or other government agents overstepping or attempting to overstep their lawful authority to detain or arrest.

&gt;- Examples of citizens asserting their rights.

&gt;- Self posts of personal experiences with rights abuses or exercising rights.

Instead of addressing it as moderators, we would prefer to leave it up to the community to acknowledge and address this issue. I don't see myself as the owner of this sub, but simply the first person here. I really want the rest of you to see yourselves as the owners of this community. At the same time, I am the HNIC. I see it as a responsibility, and I won't hesitate to exercise my power judiciously if my hand is forced.

You didn't join this sub just because you have an anti-authoritarian streak and think cops ought to be held to at least the same standards that we are. That's why you joined r/b_c_n_d. You joined this sub because our fundamental human rights are important to you. In my view, the right to be secure in one's person is **the** most basic, fundamental and cornerstone right.

To make a longwinded post come to an end, I'm asking you to take an active role as a community to use the downvote button for its intended purpose. 

To content submitters: I'm not asking you to censor yourselves. Just ask yourself if a post is really on-topic before you submit it. A post [about a large police response over a deer](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmIFreeToGo/comments/1jlp6v/police_launch_massive_hunt_against_a_small_baby/) is tenuously connected to civil rights at best.

To readers: If you can upvote a comment that points out a post is off-topic, can't you also downvote that same post?

To help even further, you can do a couple of things if you choose. First would be using the ""report"" feature. AutoModerator is setup to flag our attention when a post receives 2 reports and automatically remove a post when it gets 4 reports. 

The second, and more appropriate when violations are more egregious, is to use the ""message the moderators"" feature above the list of moderators. You can use this to send us a link and an explanation of what you think is wrong.

Thanks in advance for your help. This sub wouldn't be as great as it is without you.

FreedomsTorch	29	1	6	"First of all, many, many thanks to Rondeline for being an excellent moderator and submitter. Without that help, this subreddit wouldn't be what it is.

According to our traffic logs, when people find out this subreddit exists, they subscribe at a very high rate. I fear that we're at a critical juncture which could lead to an early death if not properly handled. I don't think I'm alone in desiring a long life for our sub.

**You can provide much needed help with very little effort.**

Here are some very easy things you can do:

1 - When you see content posted elsewhere that's appropriate for our sub, post a comment asking the OP to please cross-post it in here. Be sure to make a link so it's easy for the OP and other readers alike to get here and see our community. If the OP doesn't repost it here within 24 hours, go ahead and do it yourself. **If you see a comment requesting a cross-post, upvote it.**

2 - Participate in our contest: For the month of December (starting at the time of this post and ending at 12:01AM January 1), the submitter who gets the most total upvotes will become a moderator, and will stay one indefinitely so long as they uphold our very relaxed standards. I strongly believe that moderators ought to be a part of the community, and I see no better way of doing that than to reward those who make a difference.

Thanks in advance and for your past work and effort. Together we can make this a thriving community that brings awareness to the cause of freedom and liberty.

TheMindsEIyIe	35	11	66	"Was just driving from one relatives to another at around 1AM with two family members and a friend. Out of state plate since we are visiting, I'm the only car on the road, I start to get followed by another vehicle very close. Since I'm clearly not from the area, and didn't know the speed limit, I just went at what was comfortable given the conditions, which happened to be 45. As I pull into the driveway of my destination, lights go on. All 4 passengers were asked to give ID. My cousin, who didn't feel he should, didn't, only to have the officer request his. No violation was stated, nor was registration asked for. When I asked, ""why am I being pulled over"" the response was. ""Do you know the speed limit?"" I replied ""no, was 45 too fast?"" to which the officer said ""well the speed limit is 55"". I asked if there was a minimum, or if that was illegal and he said ""well it's below the median speed""..... He ran all of our licenses after I asked him if we were being detained or free to go. He let us off but.... It troubles me that he pulled me over for zero legal reason, and then scanned everyones IDs. 

Thoughts?? Should I file a complaint?

It live streams video to my Bambuser profile and simultaneously places a direct link to the video on my Facebook feed. As soon as I press record, it's already online. A cop can take my phone, smash it to pieces, and melt the memory card to goo, and I'll just go home and download a copy of the BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER ON MY MEMORY CARD TO BEGIN WITH. It's live, uploaded to my Facebook. Instantly. NOBODY is gonna delete MY evidence.

EDIT: Cops take phones because a loophole allows them to, as ""evidence"" IF THEY THINK THERE'S A RISK OF YOU DESTROYING THE FOOTAGE. [This happened to a friend of mine this past August](http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/Questions-Raised-After-Cell-Phone-Confiscated-169727176.html), but the ACLU said that even if the cop was gonna take the video, SEIZING IT WHILE HE WAS STILL RECORDING WAS WRONG. The cops also ""have to make an effort to get you to voluntarily share the footage before confiscating a phone"".

So they'll look mighty silly when you, yourself post the video in a public forum.

EDIT #2: This story aired at 11pm. The police called to offer my friend his phone back at 9am. The phone was smashed to pieces and the memory card was wiped. NBC had a computer guy set up to try to recover his video, but Ray lost the memory card like a moron. Don't be too hard on him though, because he's got kids and a job and therefore, no time to pursue this. Our friend John's TRIAL FOR A $92 LOITERING TICKET is January 23rd, at 1:30pm.

UPDATE: 1/23/13 JOHN WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF LOITERING! The police didn't even mention the video that they ""needed to seize as evidence"". The judge (a younger guy in a suit who apologized for not ""wearing his bathrobe"") said, ""You may have been an asshole, but you did nothing illegal that night. You're free to go.""

I was the designate driver and hadn't been drinking so i thought i had a break light or tale light out. I pulled over into a gas station parking lot and was asked for my license and registration, neither expired or anything. After handing over my license he asked me to get out of the car. I politely asked what i had done and he wouldn't tell me. Knowing i had done nothing wrong i got out anyway. He told me to go sit in the front seat of his car. I again asked why and what i had done and he said he would tell me after running my info. I knew there was nothing on my name so i just got in. After 10 minutes in the car he told me i was fine and i was driving on the line. Then gave me a warning and told me to have a good night. 


The question: Once i asked what i had done and why i was being told to get out of the car was the officer supposed to tell me?

But, I think there are better options for someone who anticipates such encounters because of where they live, or other reasons. 

Here's what I found in my searches:

* Openwatch

Has apps for Android that allow you to record audio and video while *your screen appears blank*. The apps also upload the final recording, but only after the encounter - no live streaming

* Vehicle dashcams

I've seen a few options, from $20 junk, to $800 professional driver systems like you see in taxicabs. The bulls-i vehicle blackbox recorder is about mid-range in price, discrete and ecords video and audio. Again, no streaming offsite. 

* Personal/wearable recorders

I imagine a lot of people wearing these routinely as memory sizes allow simple always-on recording and overnight charging. They range from the purpose built and obvious like the $150 Looxcie to the ""Mini DV"" a $14 plastic pocket-clip recorder and its various imitations. 

* Improvised solutions

I recently found Call2record, a company that allows you to setup an account where you can call a number, put it on speakerphone, and have it immediately start recording everything for up to 30 minutes, silently. It's free, and after the call you get an SMS with a link to the audio. Offsite, impossible to delete, works on any telephone, even landline. It's on my speeddial. 

I'd love to hear other ideas, tools, suggestions, products that will help someone living in a abusive-police area to protect themselves.

They are now putting police on patrol in swat gear carrying AR-15's. I have nothing against guns, I love guns, but this seems like nothing more than a show of force and establishing a negative relationship with its citizens.

When announcing this program they have made such claims as:

PPD Chief Stovall:

""They may not be doing anything but walking their dog,, but they're going to have to prove it."" - Paragould Police Department Chief Stovall

""Stovall said the officers will be clad in protective gear and carry AR-15 rifles. Stovall says that if officers see people on the street, they'll ask why they are out and ask to see identification.""

http://www.kait8.com/story/20354864/paragould-police-to-start-foot-patrols &lt;-- Story

Arkansas is a stop and identify state as per  Ark. Code Ann. §5-71-213(a)(1) (loitering)

(a) A person commits the offense of loitering if he or she:

(1) Lingers, remains, or prowls in a public place or the premises of another without apparent reason and under circumstances that warrant alarm or concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity and, upon inquiry by a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself and give a reasonably credible account of his or her presence and purpose;

It seems that unless you are lingering, remaning, or prowling you cannot be detained or asked for ID. Am I thinking along the proper lines? Does this not seem crazy? Is this something that I should contact the ACLU about?

If this is as illegal and wrong as I think it is, I am considering meeting them on the street to see how they handle such encounters.

What are my rights?	bookhockey24	29	8	44	"I am a natural-born US citizen, and I currently work overseas in South Korea for an American corporation. I recently went on vacation to Turkey, Amsterdam, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, and Spain. I've also been to Russia on vacation last year. All of these visits were in full compliance of visa requirements by the various government authorities.

Upon returning to the US (Houston IAH) I was told I would need to go through a ""secondary inspection"" at the Customs desk. I was escorted to a Customs holding area, where I was among 7-9 others waiting. I waited for roughly an hour before being called into an office by a single Customs agent.

At this point, I wasn't happy but I also wasn't sure of my legal rights considering CBP is not to my knowledge subject to the same rules as ordinary police. I was asked invasive questions about my overseas activities, including cities, hotel names, tour operators, who accompanied me, and if I had family or friends in Turkey. I was also asked about my occupation, employment history, corporate contacts in the US, coworkers' identities, etc. 

When asked if I had friends or family in Turkey, I replied *""No.""* The officer responded, ""Then why were you in Turkey?"" I was incredulous.

------------

*Me: ""Is that a legitimate question?""*

Officer: ""Yes. If you didn't know anybody in Turkey, why were you there?""
  
*Me: ""As I said, I was on vacation.""*

Officer: ""By yourself?""  

*Me: ""Yes, as I was on the entire trip, from Turkey through 5 other countries in Europe. As far as I'm aware, that is not yet a crime.""*

The conversation (interrogation?) went on for almost an hour. At the end, I asked - not very politely - *""Why was I selected to be detained?""*

Officer: ""You are not being detained. And don't take it personally, this is a random, routine inspection.""  

*Me: ""Do you expect me to believe that? Should we go back out to the holding area and look at the people in the room, then tell me again this was 'random and routine'?""* (Sad that I should even have to say this, but I am a white male in my early 20s and **not** of Middle Eastern descent. Every other person in the holding area either appeared 'Muslim' or Mexican.)

Officer: *awkward silence* ""Yes, this is random and routine. Don't take it personally, we are all done here.""

I recently have started using my phone's ability to record audio, and keep it in my pocket at all times. Specifically, the iPhone has the ability to continuously record audio even when it's ""locked"", and turned off, so to speak. Therefore, police usually won't think to snatch my phone when their focus is on my camera. If the situation ever arises where my camera is messed with, I will still have an audio recording of any confrontation, and even if a cop figures out that my phone has been recording, it's locked with a complex password.

My teacher then comes to me and tells me to give her my phone. Naturally, I said no. She then tells me to go to the office. I go to the office and essentially haggle with my principal. He tells me put my phone on his desk. I tell him that I will put it on his desk only if I get it back after the school day was over. 

After school gets out I go to his office, and he tells me that I'm not getting my phone back. He says that I'm going to have to pay $15 if I want my phone back. I tell him he's crazy, and that what he is doing is called theft. He is a major fucking ass hole and locked my phone in a safe. Fuck him.

FoodIsProblematic	26	8	7	"The majority [ruled on Tuesday](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/27/drug-dog-sniff-is-unconstitutional-search-supreme-court-rules/) that bringing a dog, as equipment to detect odors undetectable to the human nose, onto private property requires a search warrant.  

What does this mean for warrantless use of drug-sniffing dogs during traffic stops?  At DUI or immigration checkpoints?  When walking down the street?  

Is this ruling applicable only when private land is involved, or also when these dogs, or other detection equipment, are used in the investigation of private citizens during encounters (like running the dog, on a public street, around your car, and thereby investigating your private property, during a stop)?

Last week, I was at work when someone called in an anonymous tip, saying that they had seen marijuana inside of my vehicle.  I'm a messy person, and there are a number of things in my car that could possibly been mistaken for things that they are not.  The police showed up to my workplace just before I got off, and when I walked to my car I was greeted by two officers who told me about the tip and asked to search my car.  I've never even seen marijuana before, and being a pretty passive person I allowed it.  My question is, did they have any legal right to search my car with an anonymous tip being the only basis, and if so, could they have done it if I had refused?  What if they had shown up earlier and I was not around to unlock my car?  Could they have come into my work and looked for me?"	t5_2ve29	True

1365723264.0	1c64z4	AmIFreeToGo, a question for you!	HueGorgan	28	10	31	"I am curious over some issues involving the police asking you to exit your vehicle, and the law around those areas. 

for example: A typical traffic stop, and an officer asks you to get out of the vehicle, you are required by law to get out of the car (please comment if this is wrong (Pennsylvania v mimms)).  But a DUI checkpoint, you don't have to get out of the car because you haven't committed an offense and the stop is (considered) voluntary. Are these assumptions correct? 

And if example 1 is correct, a pat down (frisk)outside the vehicle is only applicable if they have reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that you are armed and dangerous, right..? so no pat downs for basic traffic stops, or can you refuse a pat down? 

Secondly, lets say (hypothetically) that I felt threatened by the cop or that my safety was in jeopardy if I exited the vehicle, am I within my rights to refuse to exit the vehicle?  

A bit of clarity around these issues would be greatly appreciated. "	t5_2ve29	True

Ideally, I would want to use my phone to record the conversation, but I'm not sure how they would react to me pulling out my phone.  One time while cops were approaching me (I didn't end up getting in any trouble) I unwittingly put my hands in my pocket and they FREAKED OUT.  Furthermore, I imagine if they are talking to me and I start looking at my phone they might get upset.  So if I want to record a conversation with the police, how should I go about it? Is there a right I can invoke so that they will have to let me pull out my phone and start recording? 	t5_2ve29	True

1365474231.0	1byonc	How fucked am I?		25	10	44	"So two weekends ago, my friend and I were driving back from a convenience store when we were pulled over by the police. They told us that we had been driving with our taillights out. My friend and I had smoked approximately 3 hours earlier that night, but were not high anymore. The cop came up to me in the driver's seat and asked me if I had been drinking or if I was intoxicated. I told him no to both. He had me follow a little light with my eyes and then asked me to step outside of the car. They told me privately that the car smelled of weed, and because my friend was on probation and would I have gone to jail for three months if charged, I took the fall for the weed, bong, and grinder in the backpack behind the passenger seat. The cops asked me again if I was intoxicated, to which I told them that I had smoked earlier in the day, but was not high anymore, and made me do a field sobriety test, which I felt I did well on. I followed his instructions and didn't violate any of the rules. The cop hesitated and then told me to turn around and that I was being placed under arrest. They then took me to a hospital, took my blood, and took me to jail, where I was processed etc. I was then released. My question: Do I have any chance at all to fight the OWI(operating while intoxicated) they're charging me with? I had smoked the day before the arrest, and would have already had THC metabolites in my blood at the time of the arrest. Would that be the right path to take in this situation? I realize that I should talk to an attorney, but I don't go to uni where my attorney is located, and have to finish out the school year before I can meet with him face to face. I was just wondering if anyone here has gone through a similar experience and would have advice to give me. TL;DR-Got pulled over for taillights being off, had weed, bong, and grinder and was arrested for an OWI when I wasn't high. Blood was taken at a hospital before going to jail.

I'll just copypasta from over there:

TL;DR - Video of a male driver and his lawful and successful resistance to an attempted vehicle search at a traffic checkpoint by a female officer. I think it was I-10, TX or AZ, female officer was possibly border patrol.
I'm certain it was a male driver and a female officer. She may have been state police, border patrol, sheriff, not sure, but for some reason I think border patrol. I'd call her a ""bad cop"" because she tried every trick in the book to search that truck (van?). Guy knew his rights, knew how to exercise them, and did so in a calm, cool, and polite way. Eventually the cop realizes she's not getting anywhere legally and wisely resorts to letting the citizen go about his business. But as I recall I was cracking up watching this dude very calmly ask, ""am I free to go"" so many times in so many ways all the while ignoring her lies and pressing forward and attempting to leave. She tried to trip him up so many times and I remember thinking she must have been pissed that this guy knew how to stand up for his rights just as well as she knew how to abuse them.

I recently posted a [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmIFreeToGo/comments/173w4m/tools_for_citizen_police_monitoring_what_kinds_of/) on appropriate tools for self-protection in the form of recording devices and apps. 

I got great information from that discussion and I also did quite a bit of research, leading me to purchase a dashcam. 

*I have no association with the vendor, nor any interest. I chose them from a variety of dashcams offered online by retailers such as amazon.com, newegg.com and ebay.com.* 


**My review:**


The [ETK-2000 bulls-i](http://www.bulls-ivehicledriverecorders.com/ETK-B2000VehicleDriveRecorderCarBlackBoxDVR.aspx) is the mid-range product that offers all the features I was looking for. The lower-end product (ETK-1000) costs $130, so not a huge difference in price, for the additional features. I am considering the ETK-1000, however as a rearview-cam to complement the forward-looking ETK-2000, which seems to be the intended use of the product as add-on camera supplementing to the more expensive model.

The [full feature list](http://www.bulls-ivehicledriverecorders.com/ETK-B2000VehicleDriveRecorderCarBlackBoxDVR.aspx#details) is online, but to [summarize](https://www.bulls-ivehicledriverecorders.com/images/boxicons.jpg): GPS, HD video, audio, 3-axis accelerometer for bump detection, SD card recording, continuous recording auto-looping, open video format.

Pros:  

* It can be quickly and easily rotated to face inwards during a stop, to record the driver and any interactions they have. This makes it a 2-in-1 camera almost. 

* It can be moved from car to car (I have 2), with the purchase of an extra cable and mounting bracket, it is light and takes 1 sec to install.

* Completely automatic, always-on. But also parking protection and incident recording where it never deletes g-force initiated videos. So even if you miss the bumper damage for 2 weeks, you can still find the incident on the camera.

* No screen, no delete button. Unobtrusive. I don't want a huge 10"" display dashcam that can be yanked out and smashed or deleted. I want something that no one notices so that I can safeguard it. If stopped I intend to use my cellphone to record video openly while the dashcam records too. Someone who wants to stop me videographing will  likely focus on the cellphone, smash that and not notice the dashcam.

* Great video, audio. The image is clear with a lot of detail. The audio is clear and embarrassing, since I sing to the radio when driving *blush*. 

* The parking-watch kicks in reliably and the g-force sensitivity can be tuned from too sensitive (nudge, potholes trigger it) to a level that will probably only trigger if airbags deploy.  

* GPS locks within a minute of leaving the enclosed garage. 

* Frame rate is very smooth, recording is completely uninterrupted, even while the recorded ""chunks"" the video into 5-7MB segments, probably to manage the FAT filesystem and cache better. Not a single millisecond lost, video or audio. 


Cons:

* Small enough it could be snatched if a window is broken and it is noticed. Though, small enough it very well might not be noticed.

* Viewing software is Windows only (bleagh). However, video files are mp4 so viewable on any OS. Haven't figured how to overlay the GPS and audio without the proprietary viewer yet, but I can always find a Windows box if I need one. 

* Does not have ""night-vision"". However, the light sensitivity is adeuqate so that it works fine in cloudy/foggy weather. At night it ""sees"" the cone of the headlights and about a foot beyond, then blackness. It's like viewing a tunnel of light. I will be experimenting with simple bumper mounter IR spotlights (10-LED, quarter sized) which might illuminate night video better, let's see.

I'd love to hear comments, feedback and any experiences others have had with this or similar devices. 

I hope a ""review"" is appropriate for this reddit, I apologize to the moderators otherwise ;-)"	t5_2ve29	True

A couple years ago I was driving home from a friends house around 11 PM when I was pulled over. He claimed a ran a stop sign, but I didn't because there was a car in the intersection. The cop did not actually flip his lights on until I turned into my neighboorhood which was maybe 1/4 mile from the stop sign which leads me to believe he was just made up a reason to find out what I was doing and had to justify pulling me over. I was around 17-18 at the time. Well at this time I just agree with the cops that I ran it and was asked if they could search the vechile because he said ""There had been thefts around the neighborhood,"" which I now believe to be a lie to let him search the car. I said yes. After the search I was told I was free to go. Now can the officer use the search kinda of like a bribe to get me out of a ticket. Something like if I refuse the search then I get a ticket for running the stop sign. But if I let them search the car then I get off with just a warning.  


Another time on my way back with a few friends around the same time and had a cop follow me through the neighborhood with all his lights off. Not even the head lights were on and it was around 11:00 PM. Only after stopping at my friends house did he turn on his lights and start a traffic stop for parking on the wrong side of the road. (It was a residential street and every other car on the street was parked on the wrong side of the road.) What can I do in these situations? I was let off with a warning but something seems illegal about following me with no lights on what so ever. 


A few more questions about how to handle officers who ask you to step out of the car and say they will run a dog around the vehicle. I have read that a cop can walk a dog around the car but know that the dog can ""find something."" If the dog finds something but I don't consent to any searches with out a warrent.Am I legally protected? or does the officer have the right to search the vehicle. I don't carry drugs in the car ever it's just a huge inconvience and time waster. 

Another time I had a friend get pulled over because I was in the back seat and the cop claimed I was not wearing my seatbelt. But the real reason he was pulled over was probably because I was in the back middle seat and no one was riding in the front passenger. I figured this because the first thing he asked after running my license was why are you in the backseat? Yet again I was let off with another warning. 

I know nothing can be done as the events happened quite a bit in the past and I don't have any video evidence. Just looking for how to handle the situations in the future. 


**TL:DR**  Seems like the cops in my city are making up false claims to pull you over to run your ID and then let you off with a warning just to see what you are up to at the time. How do I handle these situations. "	t5_2ve29	True

""Whenever any law enforcement officer of this state encounters any person under circumstances which reasonably indicate that such person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a violation of the criminal laws of this state or the criminal ordinances of any municipality or county, the officer may temporarily detain such person for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of the person temporarily detained and the circumstances surrounding the person’s presence abroad which led the officer to believe that the person had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a criminal offense.""

As I understand it, states like Texas don't have these laws, so you can refuse to identify yourself if they haven't suspected you of committing a crime (I saw a police interaction video from someone in Texas, so that's what I'm basing it off of).  Can someone please explain the difference between the Florida statute I've cited, and states without Stop &amp; Identify laws?  Do police have to state why you've been detained in either case?

I make some outrageous claims, justifying my position that big banks must be broken up:  they hurt kids, they're corrupt, they launder money for drug lords, they bribe Congress, whatever.

The local bank manager claims he wants my name &amp; address so their lawyer can serve me with papers in a libel suit.  The bank's actual inside &amp; outside counsel will likely laugh at such trivial crap, but it seems plausible that the police will, and lawfully can, demand ID.

If it's purely a civil matter, I suppose you could provide just your name and the name/address of a law firm, not your home address.

What if the bank manager claims you're advocating a run on the bank [which is criminal](http://law.onecle.com/california/financial/1327.html)?  The town D.A. will laugh at the bank &amp; cops, but in order to present him with the facts for deciding not to prosecute based on 1st Amendment or just stupidity reasons, the facts must be gathered.

1373676814.0	1i6x1e	Be honest please. Was I right or wrong in this situation. I wanna exercise my rights, but I don't wanna be a douche.	DeaditeQueen	19	6	17	"I live in WY (lived in NY for 99% of my life) and going from a very liberal blue state to a conservative red state I quickly familiarized myself with some basic legal codes, etc just so I never make an uninformed decision when/if dealing with law enforcement.

Today I was with my husband and daughter on the main shopping street. My husband sat on a bench outside a formal wear shop while our daughter and I ran in for a few things. When we came out my husband was on the phone with a family member dealing with a family emergency. Being a small town the street was a bit busy, but overall quite. A man pulls up in an SUV with a large breed dog hanging out the back window barking like a damn car alarm. My husband yelled ""Shut that dog up!"" to which he got glares from the driver as the dog continued its consistent loud barking. My husband, desperate to hear his phone, plugged his other ear and started walking away. The dog kept barking (I worked for a vet and this dog annoyed ME!). My husband, half panicked, again turned and yelled ""Shut that dog up!"", again a glare that shot daggers. My husband yelled ""Is there a fucking problem with controlling your dog?!"".

I knew he needed to talk in the phone so our daughter and I slipped into a trinket store and the man pulled off. We exit a few minutes later and my husband is surrounded by a group of cops. I ask what crime is he being accused of, they answered ""Breach of peace."". I asked ""For telling a man to stop his dog barking?"". They replied ""No. For using an obscenity in public."".

I said ""We'll that's stupid. He can't say ""fuck"" in public? That not even the definition of breach of peace in the state."". Officer replied ""Actually the statute specifies the word."" I'd had enough and my husband was still emotional from not getting the full deal on the family emergency then getting stopped by cops on the street. I retorted ""Really? Code 6-6-102 states breach of peace is the playing of loud music OR use if violent threats and/or obscene language with the KNOWLEDGE OR PROBABLE CAUSE to specifically disturb the peace. My husband told the guy to shut the dog up so he could hear his phone, and there's nothing to indicate he had knowledge he would or intended to disturb the peace of the entire street.""

""So you think it's ok to say ""fuck"" in public??"" asked one Officer. Just to note our 14yr old was the ONLY youth visible on the street, which had roughly 20-30ppl window shopping over the 4 block shopping road. I said ""Fuck yes. Plus you said the statute specifically mentions the word. It does not. In fact ""obscene"" is very vague. If a group of elderly women walked by and I said 'Vagina' in a loud voice they would probably see it as obscene, but I go into my doctor and he uses the word several times over the period of my annual exam and Pap smear.""

Now I 100% realize Officers only ENFORCE the law. They do not create the law. But this Officer had attempted to blatantly lie and say that the word ""fuck"" was in the statute. And it is most definitely not. Another officer chimed in ""I'm not sure what you THINK you know about statutes, but you're wrong. The statute DOES specify the f-word."". I pulled out my phone (I have a large collection of WY statutes on my phone), pulled up 6-6-102a and offered my phone over.

""Don't play her game."" one officer told another who was reaching to see it. ""This is YOUR states statute. This is exactly how it reads. Show me the word ""fuck"" and I'll buy every ticket to the policemens ball you got when the time comes around.""

The Officers immediately bid my husband farewell and left. I feel I did the right thing, or at least tried to but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Did I handle this correctly? At no time did I interrupt, use a rude tone, etc. I was cool as a penguin in an icebox. I maintained calm, laid back body language the entire time as well. Being from NY I will most likely get in trouble myself for saying ""fuck"" or a variety of other colorful terms in public at some point. Should it happen again, have I had a descent run or did I fuck it up? I can take the honesty."	t5_2ve29	True
1372488837.0	1hata2	Got stopped tonight need some advice	_Epidemic_	15	5	26	I am 17 and currently residing in NH tonight me and a few of my buddies got pulled over while walking home at around 12pm. We were swimming and left the water hole we were hanging around at, About half way home a cop pulled in front of us and stopped us. I'll admit I had a little bit to drink but not enough to clog my head, All my friends were drinking too. The cop was nice with us at first, Small conversations Etc.. I told him I had nothing to drink and all of my friends did too, He asked us to blow on his hand so he could smell our breaths. I gladly volunteered too and he told me my breath smelt fine, He said all my friends smelled like alcohol though. Then when his back up arrived it was all down hill from there, They brought out a Breathalyzer and asked for all of us to take it. I was the only one to refuse out of the group then once I refused the cop didn't like that so much and had me do sobriety tests, Once I passed 3 of them he got aggravated and said I smelt like alcohol even though I had passed 3 sobriety tests and his other officer said my breath smelt fine. I think the officer got mad at me for utilizing my rights, I'm hoping to go to court and beat the charges But I've never fought a case before I've only pleaded guilty so I wouldn't know the first step into tackling this suitiation.	t5_2ve29	True

I'm curious why the film makers talk so much. I realize there is a mindset of educating the stopping officer as the Mansfield video showed. That guy clearly wanted to open a full dialogue. While I doubt the effectiveness of that I can see why it would be someone's goal.

When you look at some of the others however (like the Oregon video) where their intention seems to be to make a point to exercise their rights I'm confused why they talk so much.

Some examples: ""Why are you recording"" because I have the right and i can. Period the end. 
Same answer to why are you open carrying and just about to any question.

I guess it just seems people get diarrhea of the mouth and go on and on far more than they should. Perhaps it's just the natural instinct to the situation and adrenaline. Since I've never done this I honestly don't know. I would like to think I would want to say the bare minimum and walk away as soon as possible to prove the point. Then again I'll readily admit that I don't know that I have the courage to do a video so there's that...

The purpose of the subreddit is to promote productive civil discourse about articles, videos, etc. detailing the actions of public servants (police, politicians, etc.); though we do have an expectation that the focus may land heavily on police actions.

A bit more about the new place:

Think of it as bad_cop_no_donut but applied to public servants in general and with a number of major changes. OathWatchers will not tolerate threats against other users or against the subjects of the videos, we will act as active moderators (and actually respond to users), and will do our best to promote active discussion about the posts rather than a community that upvotes ""Fuck the police"" and ""all pigs should die"" to the top of posts. We want to promote a place where all discussion is welcome regardless of the side taken or who is taking it and we are working on partnering with subs like /r/ProtectAndServe, /r/AmIFreeToGo, /r/LegalNews, and /r/Police_v_Video  to allow for a wide range of views and articles to be brought in.

If this sounds like a good place for you, great! Please feel free to stop by, read our sidebar, ask the mods any questions, and let us know your thoughts on things! If it's not your thing or you're happy with your current subs, power to you, but you're always welcome.

EDIT: While lurking I found exactly why the new subreddit was initially created. A person asks for statistics and is downvoted while the person telling him to (improperly I might add) ""extrapolate bitch"" is upvoted. It only took me a few minutes to find and post said statistics and I have been downvoted for such.

He was then stopped by a police officer and asked if he had any alcohol on him, and then proceeded to tell him if my friend lied to him he was going to take him to jail. My friend confessed to having alcohol and was issued a MIP (minor in possession). My question is, could my friend have simply denied answering any question and got away free since he was not doing anything visibly wrong? This is all in South Carolina by the way. 	t5_2ve29	True

States (in the United States) *do not* operate under the common law for the purposes of law enforcement. Rather, they have a penal code (or an equivalent) which contain **in-law** crimes. These crimes include murder and over-parking. It is a strong term to use for the latter, and of course the the law for centuries has recognized there are more serious and less serious crimes. 

The definition the United States Supreme Court has generally operated under is:

**Crime**: *An act that the law makes punishable*; the breach for a legal duty treated as the subject-matter of a criminal proceeding. 

I understand that some you don't think that in-law or statutory crimes are legitimate, but some of this common-law advocate ""advice"" is extremely dangerous and can prejudiced a person in a legal setting. 

**tl:dr**: Crimes include statutory crime. Take common-law advocacy advice with a grain of salt. (Note: not saying that is the way it should be but that is reality).

*This does not constitute legal advice. Please speak with your attorney.*"	t5_2ve29	True

I've also been wondering if there is a service to immediately upload to the internet in case an LEO decides my evidence is inconvenient. [Eye-Fi](http://www.eye.fi/) has wi-fi cards that will auto upload, but obv depended on open wireless nearby. [Google+] (http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1304818) has services to instant upload to G+ from Android devices... I imagine there's something similar for the Facebook app on ANdroid and iOS? Someone else mentioned [Qik](http://qik.com/) in the comments a while back. That looks pretty sweet.

What do you guys use? 

EDIT: Here are the popular votes. I'll update as more become available, or PM me for an add!

- [Bambuser](http://bambuser.com)

Free, live video/audio streaming. Allows geotagging of data. Quality and resolution configurable for stream, local storage, or both. Has a very cool option to cache local data while streaming, and then upload content as it can to improve quality of online archive. Does not 100% covertly record, icon shows in running apps, but **will continue to run with locked/off screen**. Access from the internet anywhere, download content from your account or view on bambuser.com

- [Qik](http://qik.com/info/overview)

Free, identical service as Bambuser, I believe higher resolution stream requires paid service. Has some social media features to Facebook post or tweet links to upload, though this isn't the default behavior. Will also upload to multiple locations automatically. One secondary difference is that Qik is a mobile service only. Bambuser allows streaming from both computer and mobile. Also, **Qik stops recording when phone is locked**. Some people find the interface more user friendly and the feature controls more intuitive than Bambuser.

- [ACLU OpenWatch/CopWatch](http://openwatch.net/apps/)

Covert recorder. Made for one button turn on and record of either audio only, video, or both. You turn it on and it runs ""hidden"" in the background with no running icon until you actually open it up and tell it to stop, or the phone dies, or storage runs out. Stores locally, you chose to upload. If you do, it's sent to OpenWatch servers where hungry lawyers ~~pour over the data to see if they can make money off of you~~ see if your rights were violated. Not as many technical features, but you do get a 3rd party reviewing your ""case"" and editing incriminating details out of your video for free.

- [GoPros, Handicams, Dashcams](http://gopro.com/)

A camera that looks like a camera lets an LEO know immediately that you're filming them. This may or may not be advantageous for you. Higher priced, you will undoubtedly get much higher detail and quality from your recordings, as well as more storage capacity. Most do not stream or provide upload capability out of the box. The GoPro specifically can be combined with a ""wifi"" backpack to sync with an app on your phone to allow remote control. Camera mounted in different locations of the cab for [truckers](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmIFreeToGo/comments/173w4m/tools_for_citizen_police_monitoring_what_kinds_of/c826dva), for instance, could utilize a service like this. /u/marvborg has a great dashcam review for the [ETK-2000 here](http://redd.it/1816cp).

- [Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft Skydrive] (http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/dropbox-gdrive-skydrive/)

Most mobile devices already have excellent built in camera and camcorders. File sharing and cloud storage options are a simple effective way of integrating your built in service with an option to upload to the Internet and save the data. Use your existing camera to film, then one button touch to share to the cloud app of your choice. One less account to set up for a separate service, and you know these services will be around for a long time so it's unlikely your data will suddenly vanish. Some services may require WiFi in order to upload.

I just watched this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc. This is a presentation by a defense attorney and police officer. In a nutshell, it talks about how a person should never talk to the police, under any circumstances. That anything you say can only hurt you (even if you are innocent) and cannot improve your situation. 

I understand the larger implications at hand, but my question is this. How does the above video apply to things like traffic stops. The officer shared that they use dialogue to get a confession and dictate the conversation after. Should I follow officers instructions and remain silent? Meaning I still hand over my proper paperwork, but ignore any questions? What about if he asks me to step out of the car? I don't suspect he would just let me go if I sat there and said nothing? Also, would doing the above potentially turn what would be a simple speeding ticking into something more?

Asking the same questions about DUI's brings even more fire to this question. 

What is more, there are times where officers will pull people over and issue warnings. Some sources even say to request warnings. But that would likely never occur if the interaction began with a standoffish approach to the whole process.

That's more of an existential question because I -know- how I feel about the role of law enforcement, but for the public at large I think I would have a lot to prove.

Is the consensus here that there is no way to be a rights respecting cop? Is there any LEO here that manage to balance stupid crap like DUI checkpoints with your personal beliefs? Are your superiors one track minded or do they understand and let you stay away from those duties.

There were several pedestrians crossing the street in the crosswalk and just as my light turned green (I was driving), a police officer pulled over to the side of the road and ordered the pedestrians to come over with the loudspeaker built in to the police cruiser. ""Hey you two guys, come over here... you two guys with the backpack and pants on, not you... you two guys come over here."" They complied and approached the cruiser. 

I think that he was probably going to give them a scolding for entering the intersection after the red hand started flashing or something. I had to get going so I didn't see the resolution but it made me wonder about it because it seemed pretty rude. Can an officer do this? My first instinct was to just ignore him if I was the pedestrians, if he wants to talk to me, he can get off his ass and come over to me. I'm sure that if the pedestrians had done something illegal (I'm not sure if they had) then he technically could call them over, but otherwise could not? Anyone care to enlighten me?"	t5_2ve29	True

This understanding was informed by 1) the assumption that if I did not cooperate with an instruction, the police officer could take action against me, and 2) the assumption that I could take legal action against an officer if I was given an instruction that somehow violated my rights.

If these assumptions are correct, then the instruction / request distinction could come in handy; the police wouldn't take action against me for not cooperating, and I could deal with any violations of rights in court. However, in examining this reddit and others, I have not seen this distinction mentioned anywhere.

So, is what I have outlined above a useful tactic for the purpose of minimizing contact with police, or is it faulty?"	t5_2ve29	True

1367445260.0	1dicwo	I feel like I was illegally searched in WV. Help!	Trevmiester	10	2	14	"Story:

I was driving across the border into WV from PA to visit the head shop and make a stop at the cig/beer store next door. I did not purchase anything but my friend who was with me purchased a grinder (has not been used yet). The parking lots are connected with what I thought was just a middle section of a parking lot between the 2. 

A cop pulls off the road and pulls me over and tells me that that section is not part of the roadway and that he will write me a ticket for driving off the roadway. No big deal, seems like kind of a grey area but I don't know much about that section of the law so I can't really say anything.

 Before I go any further I should say that I am a socially anxious person and that I am nervous around cops and figures of authority as it is even if I'm completely innocent. He sees my nervousness as probable cause and asks me to exit the vehicle. Me, being the nervous wreck I am, just do it (I know stupid) without question.  He pats me down and he finds nothing. 
He pulls the whole ""if you have anything in your car you better tell me and this will be a lot easier"" speech. I tell him there is nothing to my knowledge in my car that is illegal. He then tells me he is going to search my vehicle. I refuse the search.

He asks me if I am requesting a drug dog in which I say ""No, I am just refusing the search."" He orders me to get in his car (passenger seat) as he calls in the drug dog. I know by this point (at multiple points) I should have asked ""Am I free to go?"" but I was nervous and it surprisingly didn't cross my mind until later. Also I guess he was still technically detaining me for my traffic violation.

 The drug dog comes and they take the dog twice around my vehicle. I did not see the drug dog ""hit"" on anything. When the cop came back to the vehicle I asked him if the dog hit and he refused to answer me, and then proceeded to search my car with no consent. He found, what he said was, a tiny fragment of marijuana under the driver seat. (I've never smoked marijuana in my car.) He told me he should arrest me since I didn't tell him it was there (Like I was supposed to know there was a little fragment of ""marijuana"" under my seat). Instead he writes me a ticket for possession and sends me on my way. 

I would have recorded all of this but I thought my phone was in my pocket and it ended up that it fell out when I was exiting my car. The only witnesses I have are the people in the cig/beer store and my buddy that was in the car with me (but idk how much the people in the store saw. I do know they saw at least a little bit though because they told me they were sorry for my luck and asked if they found anything.

I am thinking about appearing in court for the possession charge but I need to know if I have a leg to stand on. Was there some loophole that they had that allowed the search to be legal? Is there something I should have done (besides asking am I free to go or recording)? Is being nervous and being vague with the questioning probable cause? I didn't want to give up too much detail as I was afraid that I would accidentally say something incriminating and I understand that I have the right to remain silent."	t5_2ve29	True

Michigan State Room Entry Policy

*The university respects the residents’ privacy and control over their environments. However, it is also responsible for providing quality facilities at reasonable costs to present and future residents.
Therefore, university staff may enter rooms to ensure they are maintained in safe and sanitary conditions and to make necessary repairs, whether the resident is present or not. A notice will be left if the room was entered and maintenance was completed.*

Now this would mean that with no probable cause (AKA nothing illegal in plain sight and no smells, etc.) they cannot search our rooms without our consent. A hallway smelling like marijuana, as in a large section of the hallway, not just one specific door, would not apply as probable cause either would it?

I'm also unclear on Stop-and-identify laws. Michigan does not seem to have these laws, but could they be a city-specific law, and how can I check that for East Lansing?

At some point you announce that since you are not being detained, you wish to end this encounter... make sure you say it clearly since it should obviously be recorded... After that, every time the officer opens his mouth, honk the horn and reassert that you do not consent to the encounter. After 5? 6? 7? honks, just lay on the horn and let it sing it's song in one long note.

My girlfriend was going to give me a ride over there because my car isn't working at the moment, but first we had to stop by the library so I could print some copies of my resume.  When we get to the library their printer isn't working (of course), so we had to run to a Fed-Ex to use their computer.  This put me in danger of being late to my interview, so she proceeded to drive about 45 in a 35 towards where we needed to go.

When we were about three minutes away she sees lights in her rearview mirror.  Its a motorcycle cop, and we're getting pulled over.  Fuck.  She pulls the over and the cop dismounts and approaches the car.  Before he can even say anything she begs him to let us continue to our destination so I won't be late for the interview.  He agrees, telling her to go directly to the parking area and wait for him there.  He then jumps on his motorcycle and heads in the opposite direction.  

When we get to the parking area, I tell her to just leave.  The cop is nowhere in sight, and I don't see the sense in waiting there for a ticket.  So she lets me out and takes off.

My question, is that legal?  Can a cop order you to go somewhere else and wait for him? It would be different if he followed us to the location, but he was nowhere in sight.  I would think that since we weren't in his custody anymore that we would be free to go on our way."	t5_2ve29	True

At this point he asks me to sit on the curb, walks to my driver door, opens it up and begins searching without a warrant or permission.  I did not have any marijuana but there was an empty grinder in my center console.  I was then placed under arrest and had my car impounded. 

My bond was $150 and I'm going to have to pay another $500 to get my car out of the tow yard.

Do I have any options here?

1373575208.0	1i3u59	When required to ID yourself, what are the limits, and where do you draw the line in order to preserve 5th amendment protection.	CaptainRob	9	3	21	"So, herein lies my main question... When they say you are being detained, at a DUI checkpoint, or a traffic stop, what ID are you required to show them?  In fact, as I understand the laws, you are only required to identify yourself, not provide identification.  

Think of it this way, when I'm walking down the street and a cop thinks he's got probable cause to believe I'm involved in some crime and he wants to detain me, he asks me to identify myself.  Now, I'm not required to carry identifying papers with me everywhere I go, so I just tell him my name, and maybe my birthday or address or something (I'm still not up to speed on what constitutes ""Identification"").  But as I understand it verbal ID has been ruled as satisfying the requirements of the law.

SO, with that in mind, and believing my rights do not stop the second I close a car door, I wonder what the requirements are for identification in these situations.  So, say for instance, I provide a passport instead of a DL.  Or a state issued ID instead of a DL.  These things count as identification, and they are even government issued.  

THEN, I ask at what point is providing any form of government identification not violating my right to not be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, as guaranteed by the fifth amendment.  By providing the evidence of a DL to the officer I have provided evidence which can be used against me in a court of law.  I'd like to know how they can legally require you to provide any form of ID other than verbal.

About 5 years ago, I left my apartment and there were about 5 officers on the sidewalk in front of my door. 

I asked them what was going on, and they told me that they received calls for shots fired at a neighbor's apartment. I lived in a neighborhood type complex; meaning there were multiple buildings within the area. 

I told them I was headed to work, and asked them if I was okay to leave. They told me I was.

As I pulled out, there were two unmarked cop cars (crown vics) blocking the street. Two officers ran up to my car with their weapons drawn and were yelling at me to get out of my car. 

I complied, and they shoved me onto the hood of my car and began to pat me down. They asked me why I was so nervous, and I told them it was because I had never had guns pointed at me. 

They radioed to the other officers and they cleared me. 

I was shaky, and I didn't think to get their badge numbers. I told my uncle (who is a police officer) and he said the best thing to do was comply. 

As the day went on, I wished I had gotten their information. I felt like my rights had been infringed upon. 

If this were to happen again (I sure hope it doesn't, it was the scariest moment of my life so far) what should I do? Were they in the right? 

They had SWAT officers at the front door of the apartment under investigation, and gun men located at every vantage point, so it seems like it was a lack of communication on their part. 

I was young, scared, and willing to comply with any gun pointed at me (naturally).

He asked me to unlock and open my passenger side door and my glove box. I complied because I really don't know if he was allowed to do this. He then removed my gun, unloaded it, and took it with him to his car. 

He gave it back and I got off with a warning (just moved my car back to WA and got pulled over because I didn't have a front license plate).

Are cops allowed to remove my firearm from me?

Also if this is the wrong subreddit please let me know. I searched and didn't find one that matched what I was asking. "	t5_2ve29	True

Section 129 of the criminal code says you can not obstruct a peace officer from doing their job. So if they ask for your name and you do not comply, you have obstructed them. But are they allowed to just stop and identify me for no reason? Are their any special guidelines if they have a sort of road block that checks dogs on the path? Thanks!

 * how do we organize and create incentives for people to join their local copwatching efforts?

 * can we create online incentives? flair? 

 * how about IRL organizing? 

great footage is fun to watch, but it also goes viral to increase awareness far outside this sub. so how do we get more great footage (multiple views, hidden cameras, red-handed catches) with follow-up to ensure accountability?

BTW i use bambuser.com because it supports locked filming and broadcasts live to the website so even if the phone is destroyed, the footage isn't.

thanks in advance for all your ideas! "	t5_2ve29	True
