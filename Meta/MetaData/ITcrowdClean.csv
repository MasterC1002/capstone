As your mod, I've noticed some of the lovely things that have been posted on this subreddit, and while I do love every clip and homemade art project posted here, I think we can all agree that this is a somewhat slow community.

Some time next year, we will be graced with the IT Crowd finale in the form of some kind of special. I am proposing, in anticipation of this glorious day, a subreddit wide viewing party of all four seasons of the IT Crowd. Once a week, I will put up a self post (for which I receive no karma) for an episode of the IT Crowd (in chronological order) perhaps with some youtube clips of the episode if I can find any, and we will discuss our favorite moments, favorite jokes and all collectively nerdgasm at the epicness that is this show.

Let me know what you all think. If I get enough positive feedback, I'll post the first one sometime before Christmas."	t5_2qq8e	True

Like the title says, why is the general consensus about the US pilot episode is that it's absolutely awful? I think that it's because we are so familiar and identify with the British version. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the UK version prior to the US one I wouldn't've hated it so much.

Welcome to another week of our viewing party! This week we're watching the thrilling horror of The Red Door. Watch it on Netflix [if you DARE!!!!](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140450&amp;trkid=2361637&amp;t=The+IT+Crowd)

In this episode, we are introduced to Richmond, a fairly regular character and a fan favorite who, strangely, wasn't introduced into more than halfway through the first series. 

Personally, I think this is my favorite episode of the first series because of the wonder of Richmond's character and also the fantastic subplot of Roy being stuck under a desk.

As for my favorite line of this episode, and all of series 1:

In this episode, Jen is obsessed with buying the perfect pair of shoes, Denholm is obsessed with having a stress free office and Moss and Roy just wanna have a go on that machine.

I think this episode will most be remembered for those damn numbers that we can't get out of our heads: [0118 999 881 999 119 7253](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3m2BcYijSw&amp;feature=fvst)

In this episode, Jen goes after temp security guard Daniel by trying to impress him with her fake knowledge of classical music. In the meantime, Roy and Moss attempt to prove to Jen that all men are bastards by posting as horrible men on a lonely hearts website. [Sound familiar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITcrowd/comments/oggf1/it_crowd_fans_posting_on_rr4r_made_my_day/)

Personally, I find the end of this episode hard to watch. I like most of it, but the final scene in the restaurant is a little too embarrassing for my taste. I don't know if I just don't find it funny, but I always skip it. I get a similar feeling when watching the final board meeting scene in Italian for Beginners. Are there any IT Crowd scenes you find hard to watch?

As for favorite jokes, I LOVE the scene over the ending credits with Moss's lonely hearts video. ""Stop doing this! You're always doing this! You're making it go back in!"""	t5_2qq8e	True

Welcome to our viewing party! For those of you with Netflix, you can view the episode [Here](http://bit.ly/rBTysE).

In this landmark first episode, Jen begins her first day as an employee of Renholm Industries, but will soon realize that, as the head of IT, the job is not as glamorous as it first seems.

Personally, I've always been fascinated by the US shot by shot recreation pilot that was filmed a few years later. [Here](http://www.myvidster.com/video/307968/The_IT_Crowd_US_version_Very_strange) In my personal opinion, it was Joel McHale who sunk this ship. I think he is an extremely funny comedian, but he just doesn't have that dirty slacker quality that Chris O'Dowd has. You wouldn't believe that McHale is a creepy basement dweller who never gets laid. Also he and Richard Ayoade have zero chemistry, and to me it almost seems like Moss was forcibly sent back in time and to an alternate universe. He looks so lost without his friends.

The scene was of Moss reading the instructions on what to do during a fire and contained tips such as ""Shout fire in a loud, clear voice!

I just now got into the series (I know i'm pretty late but I had to exhaust all the American comedies before I crossed the pond) and have finished it and love it! So just wondering what do you all consider to be your favorite episode and why?

Mine would have to be The Final Countdown because the street battle is just epic and the way that Roy ends up going crazy trying to prove to Allister that he's not a window cleaner (not that there's anything wrong with that).

A close second would be Calamity Jen because let's face it, who wouldn't love the emergency services song? Also the screen-saver bit literally had me rolling on the floor laughing.

tl;dr What's your favorite episode and why?"	t5_2qq8e	True

Welcome back to another wonderful week. Apologies for the lateness. It's been a hectic week and I forgot what day it was. This week we will be witnessing another chilling, mysterious tale of death and deceit. Watch it on Netflix, but [STOP TELLING PEOPLE I SLEPT WITH YOU!!!!](http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70140450&amp;trkid=2361637&amp;t=The+IT+Crowd)

In this episode, Moss is forced to venture into the social art of lying and the results are... less than favorable. Meanwhile, Roy attempts a successful lech on fifth, but ends up in direct contact with a she-beast from under a toilet. Jen suffers most though as she goes about her day unintentionally making her bad date from the night previous think she is haunting him for lying about her.

I love this episode for several reasons, which I will now count down for you.

5. Inclusion of Small Paul. He's such a cute character and it's a shame he wasn't used more.

4. Mention of Tapas and Moss's insistence that it's pronounced Tape-ass. Seriously, have you ever had had that shit? It's delicious!

3. The way the ""scares"" come together in unexpected ways. I love when Jen leaves Bill a message after yelling at Moss and later it sounds like a demonic warning.

2. The overemotional woman at both funerals who has no idea who died.

I chose to focus on The IT Crowd and the images audience members pick up from the show. I focused on two episodes in the second series, ""The Work Outing"" (S2E1) and ""Men Without Women""(S2E6). I was wondering if anyone would be willing to respond to the following questions:

* What did you think of how homosexuals were depicted in ""The Work Outing?"" Did you believe it was an accurate portrayal?

* What was your reaction to Roy pretending he was disabled in ""The Work Outing?"" What did you think about how the handicapped were portrayed in this episode?

* What was your reaction to Douglas seducing Jen in ""Men Without Women?"" Did you think this was inappropriate?

* What did you think about Douglas drugging Jen's tea in ""Men Without Women?""

And the lift is broken so I had to walk down the fucking stair case!"" then later in the episode roy says ""CALL ME AN AMBULANCE! I'M NOT (bleep)-ing joking!"" and it's censored from there on out. Was it because that scene was filmed on a set without an audience that they could edit it. But with the earlier scene it was live and they didn't want to redo the scene?

please, just tell me it gets better.  is it just the opening episode(s), heavy on exposition?  or is this series not for me?

Does it get better?	ghost_of_bb_king	2	3	5	"I honestly did not like it at all. I mean there was pretty much just one moment in the whole episode that actually made me laugh, when the guy without curly hair says he'll one day find proof that the girl doesn't know anything about computers, oblivious to the fact that the curly haired guy is just now plugging in her computer, but then they ruin it by making curly-haired dude say ""he'll realize soon,"" as if the audience is too dumb to get the joke. The one clever joke in the whole episode has to be explained. I fucking hate that. Other than that, I thought the whole thing was really bad. Annoying laugh track, stupid characters, unfunny gags and predictable jokes. But i have also heard that some episodes are ""genius"" and the pilot is a bad indicator of the quality. Is that the case or should i just give up? "	t5_2qq8e	True
