For those of you who missed the original post or ignore the sidebar, this is just a reminder about our planned river clean-up with the finalized details. We will be meeting at 10 a.m. on August 25th in the parking lot off Tredegar Road near the pedestrian walkway. We will be focusing our work on Belle Isle. An RSVP isn't a requirement, but if you are genuinely interested it would help to know in advance so we can bring the right amount of supplies and so you don't get ditched in the case that you can't make it right at 10. If you're interested please notify myself or /u/oceanic_815 directly or via rvaredditcleanups@live.com. Thanks everyone and if you could upvote this to ensure it's not entirely buried under snarky posts about local news that would be great. 	t5_2qpvj	True
1368195907.0	1e2iqz	**Warning** - Stay out of the River this weekend!	paddlin84	133	13	24	"The James is predicted to be over [9 feet this entire weekend](http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=akq&amp;gage=rmdv2) That means you can only be on the river if you have a permit from the fire department. Otherwise you are responsible for the cost of getting rescued. The James at this level is no joke and from Pony Pasture down to the 14th st. bridge is serious whitewater that only Experienced Whitewater Paddlers should attempt.

The James is not safe for swimming and at this level and it tends to have the highest amount of pollutants (like fecal coliform) in the river so you don't want to be swimming in poopy water anyway! 

There have already been [several river rescues since yesterday even of experienced and permitted kayakers](http://www.nbc12.com/story/22211934/richmond-fire-working-river-rescue-at-the-james). Don't get in the water!!! Nobody wants to hang out with someone who is covered in river poop water anyway! 

Enjoy your weekend and go check out what serious rapids look like down at Belle Isle just resist the siren call of some of the biggest urban rapids in the country. "	t5_2qpvj	True

Just wanted to stop back to say thank you to all who made suggestions. One thing we noticed was how nice everyone was, and how much you guys love your city.  We hit Hardywood Brewery, Legend Brewery, Alamo BBQ, Deep Run Roadhouse, and Strawberry St. Market. We saw the Southern Belles at the Camel, and loved it so much that we returned on sunday before leaving town to catch Hundred Pack at the Camel. Cool bar, great beer selections, fantastic food, and great music. We finished our trip with a stop at Once Upon a Vine to pick up more local microbrews before leaving town. We had a great time during our stay and it was all thanks to the suggestions from r/RVA. You Richmonders (Richmondites, Richmondees?) were all very friendly and proud of your city, and you have every right to be. We look forward to coming back. 	t5_2qpvj	True

OP had heard somewhere about the elephants, but no one seemed to remember this or had never heard of it](http://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/14votu/elephants_on_belle_isle/). I had gone to Belle Isle in search of the info sign on the subject, but it had been removed/stolen/vandalized, so it seemed there would never be any info on it. I was just looking through old pictures, and [I found an image of the sign that I had taken a while back when I first started going to the park.](http://i.imgur.com/ccC6OU0.jpg) So here it is.

LouieKablooie	81	11	23	"I purchased a dark bread, Morroccan Olive Loaf, sliced and spread the cheese onto the slice adding fresh basil and sauteed sweet onions. My intention was to start here and then try with mustard and Jelly. The smell was similar to gym shoes that have been in a dark locker for a while. Sweet acrid odor, but the consistency similar to Brie. It spread well and my gf and I shared moderate salivation for this little treat. We both took bites and commented on the smooth buttery flavor. This lasted for about 4 seconds and then it tasted like I licked a fucking armpit. There was a lot of ""Blech"" and ""Acchk"" that followed. I still have the whole block if anyone wants it. I will throw it off my fire escape into your sunroof if you drive by. Just let me know and I will give you my address. http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/35/limburger.jpg/"	t5_2qpvj	True

*Edit: I wont get anything for this, so can we upvote it to the front so more people see it? Thanks y'all!

*Edit 2.0: Good response so far. For people wondering about the ""straight line"", General Admission at the Diamond is sit where ever. The group could sit together, in whatever order they want. For those who aren't crazy about the sports thing, this could be the first in a line of meet-ups. This city has plenty to offer- come up with ideas and post them. Also, cheap is right. if it grows, and people bring non-Redditor friends/families/significant others, the price per ticket in G.A. could drop to 4 bucks(would be 5 with 20, can provide more info tomorrow when I get back to the office)

However, please please please, leash your dog when walking them around  the city. You may have the best most awesomely friendly dog in the world, but mine is not. When I take her on a walk she is on a 3 foot leash, harness, and muzzle, but she can still bite even through the muzzle. 
She is the sweetest dog ever with people, but wants to kill any dog she sees, regardless of size. I try to only walk her early in the morning and late at night. I know that she is aggressive, and only try to walk her out of the way in the alleys, but some dog owners walk the alleys as well. 
If I am outside on my patio she is on a 6' leash anchored to my porch support beam. However I do not have a fence, and am bordered by an alley, so some dog walkers come by with their dogs not on leashes. My dog doesn't want to play.
Please everyone...leash your dog. 

EDIT: Thanks all for agreeing with me for the most part. I thought I was going to get berated by a majority of dog owners."	t5_2qpvj	True

While walking the trail, several people passed that did not have their dogs leashed.  This would not bother me if the dogs had good recall or stayed by their owner when passing, but out of eight instances where dogs passed by unleashed, at least five times dogs came up to me or my one dog which is not dog friendly.  The other times I had to wait while the owner leashed their dog so that they could pass us.  

While their dogs were obviously friendly, they did not consider my dogs.  No one even apologized for their dogs running up to mine and making me nervous, or making me wait!  I told one man my dog was not friendly while his dog was in my dog's face and he said, ""Don't worry, my dog's friendly.""  

I don't think anyone minds when a dog is well-behaved off-leash.  We did pass by one person whose dog was off-leash and did not come near us.  No problem.  This made an otherwise nice walk very stressful.  My other dog is a friendly dog and loves everything, but he has to be on leash because I know he'll bother people or he'll jump in the damn river.

There are reasons for leashing a dog, aside from just general safety issues. If you are one of those people who insist on having your dog off-leash, that's fine, but please try to be considerate and remember that not everyone else's dog is friendly and you don't know the disposition or health of other dogs.  Please train your dog good recall and work with your dog to ignore distractions (such as people walking by).  And if your dog happens to be off-leash and bothering others, please, please, please just apologize.  

Not everyone is a dog person either and wants a dog running up to them.  Just please be considerate of others while having dogs off-leash."	t5_2qpvj	True

I have some friends who live a few states over that get together and do sort of a presentation club.  Basically, the deal is this: they get together once every couple of weeks, with a lot of beer, and each person gives a short presentation (five minutes or so) that they've prepared.  Presentation can be on any topic they want.  The point is to improve your public speaking skills (and also to get kind of tipsy).

So...would anyone be at all interested in doing this?

People talk about the need to share the road, which I am in full support of, but bikers in Richmond need to obey traffic laws just as the cars do. I think it's great that people want to ride their bikes through the Fan, VCU, downtown, wherever, but TOO many times I have come wayyy to close to hitting some joke who did not stop at the fucking stop sign. I am not going to feel bad for you if I hit you. In fact, you're probably going to get an earful from me as you're lying on the pavement about how damn stupid you are.

/endrant. PLEASE everyone, stress to your friends who bike in the city to obey the traffic laws. I don't want to hit anyone and I am sure no one else does. You are held to the same standard as automobile drivers.

EDIT: This is obviously quite the polarizing issue here. I understand that people drive like complete fucking assholes and I understand bikers are not always the ones at fault. Before this turns into some psycho flame war, just chill. It is the responsibility of everyone to respect the laws surrounding **sharing** the road, not just one party or the other. This post is meant as a reminder, something to bring awareness to those that may be guilty of the things I mentioned above.

Prepare for a wall of text:

Grove Avenue Exxon in Richmond VA. Backstory: My Jeep's clutch pedal assembly broke and rather than tow my car 20-30 miles to my normal mechanic (Jimmie Seay of Automotive Concepts; Who is awesome by the way). I chose to have my car towed to Grove Avenue Exxon because it was much closer. Everything was fine at first. They said they would have to order the part and it would be 3-5 business days and that estimated costs would be around $300. Okay. Great. Here's the part where it all goes pear shaped and these ass hats fucked my car. I pick it up on Thursday June 27 and pay around $300 as estimated. But, the minute I turn my car on I notic the check engine light is on. This has NEVER happened to my car before. NEVER! So, I go back in and talk to the guy who I just gave $350 to and explain that my check engine light is on and it was not before I brought my car to him. I was not rude, I was very calm and respectful. First, even though I gave him $350 not 10 minutes ago he couldn't remember what the car was in for or who I was. He had to pull up the receipt.

Here's where I truly should have fucked this guy up for talking me to like this. He treated me like I didn't know anything about cars and that it was a waste of this time to even talk to me. He told me ""We didn't do anything electrical to your car, only mechanical and that the check engine light is for electrical problems only"" WRONG, you fucking douche monkey. I calmly explain ""Well, I didn't have this problem before y'all worked on it"". To which he replies ""Your car is 14 years old, this is a coincidence, it could be a myriad of things, but definitiely not our fault"". ""Well, can you check it out?"" I asked. ""Sure, for $66"" he replies. $66. Are you fucking kidding me? He should have said ""Yes, I'll check it out, it'll only take a minute and if it is our fault we'll fix and if not we will gladly do the repairs if you want"". Upon my exasperation of this $66 raping he was trying to persuade me into he suggested I could take it to Autozone where they'll read the ECM codes for free but in his words, verbatim ""They'll tell you what's wrong but they're 17 year olds so I doubt they'll know or be able to help you fix it. That is why we are certified mechanics."" Then he proceeds to lower his sunglasses; while we're indoors no less. YOU FUCKING TWAT! Certified ass hats is more like it. The stones this guy has must be monstrous or his ego is so big it must be quite a feat for him to carry it around all day without collapsing under its weight. So, I think to myself, FUCK this guy and the horse he rode in on.

Flash forward to Saturday. I take my car to Autozone where I tell the guy behind the counter my check engine light is on and would he check it. He says ""Sure, let me help the guy behind you real quick and I'll be right with you"" And guess what? He was! I explained the whole debacle with the shit head at Exxon. Then, this ""17 year old"", in reality in his 30's, plugs in the monitor to my ECM, starts the car, reads the code and without checking a book or anything else says ""You have a gross leak/no flow from your gasoline vapor recovery system. Have you smelled gas?"" I say no, but it has smelled slightly funny. He proceeds to get under my Jeep, looks all around and says I don't see any problems with the line. He pops the hood, takes a look for 10 seconds and says ""Ah, those guys at Exxon didn't reconnect the hose to the vapor recovery box"". They must have taken this hose off to get better access to your clutch assembly becuase it is below that area on the car and they forgot to reconnect. ""But, how can that be? I was told these guys were certified mechanics and there is no way that you, without your certification, could have the infinte wisdom they have with only your 17 years of life experience?"" After thanking this courteous man repeatedly I left and went home. Thinking all the way of that egomaniacal, shit eating, fucktard at Grove Avenue Exxon. Fuck that guy, fuck that place! It was their fault, he could have fixed it right then really quickly but instead he decided to get on his high horse like the douche bag he was and he will never receive my busness again. And if your smart, you won't patronize these fucking twats either!

Oh, I forgot to share the fact that this ass clown didn't know where he parked my car. He said ""It's either in the lot or on this street, or that street, or another street. We've been so busy"" Well, if I had it my way you guys wouldn't see business ever again. The he preceeded to disrespect his clients saying. ""I bet the neighbors really love me for parking cars everywhere, but then when they come in on Sunday to get batteries replaced they want service"" Of course they do, your in the customer service industry you God damned fucking idiot. For those of you who don't know, Autozone is open on Sunday and they DON'T charge to replace your battery for you.

TL;DR: The fucktarded asshats at Grove Avenue Exxon will fuck your car up and claim it's not their fault when in nreality it most assuredly is.



UPDATE (02JUL2013): Went in there after work Monday and spoke to JT (not the guy I originally spoke to). I told him what happened and he asked for a description. Tall, skinny guy with a tatoo on his wrist and a brace on his wrist. JT said it was Tim and that he is NOT a mechanic and ""doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about"". Apologized for it. An hour later Jerry/Gerry (the owner) called me and profusely apologized and offer to pay for any expense I incurred at Autozone, which was nothing, and said Tim should have told me to come back another day and that they would check it out for free. But, he went on to say that Tim sometimes has these problems but that it is hard to find workers that will work afternoons and weekends. He essentially said, in not so many words, that he was sorry but he couldn't fire Tim but would talk to him and if this happens again ask for Chuck or Jerry/Gerry or a mechanic. Don't worry it won't happen again. I won't be back. EVER."	t5_2qpvj	True

1313110456.0	jg9zn	Hey /r/rva, some colleagues of mine and I released Android and iPhone mobile apps to track and meet up with the To the Bottom and Back buses!	willp	51	4	20	"[2BNB on the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.roar11.tbnb)

[2BNB on the iTunes App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2bnb/id449923806?ls=1&amp;mt=8)

[Visit 2BNB](http://2bnb.org/)

As the title suggests, we wrote native applications for Android and iPhone to help people better be able to utilize the great service provided by the people at To the Bottom and Back.  For those of you unfamiliar with ""2BNB"", they are a Richmond non-profit organization that provides free transportation around the city of Richmond Thursday through Saturday nights with the goal of reducing drinking and driving while still allowing people to go out and have a great time.  If you've ever ridden one of the buses, you can probably testify to the good times that can be had on them, and if you haven't yet I strongly recommend trying it out.

These applications aim to be an improvement over the current mobile website supplied by 2BNB, since the applications can use your phone's GPS functionality to locate your position and show where you are in relation to the buses, hopefully taking all or most of the guesswork out of meeting up with the buses.

This is the first release of these applications, so if you notice any bugs in either, please let us know!  The Android Market and App Store should both have links to our email addresses, and we welcome all feedback.  We're hoping you, or someone you know, can use these applications to go out and have a great time in Richmond, while remaining safe and avoiding driving after a night on the town.

As a final note, the apps are **FREE** so the worst thing you can waste on them is your time.

**Edit:**  There are a few things I probably should have mentioned in the original post, and a few more items worth addressing:

We are in no way associated with 2BNB outside of the fact that we live in the same city and agree with their goals of reducing drinking and driving.

Unfortunately, the only time the apps are ""in action"" is when the buses are running.  During most of the week the buses sit in a parking lot, although you can still open the apps and look at them if you so desire.  Luckily the release was ""coincidentally"" close to the weekend so hopefully some of you can put them to good use tonight and tomorrow night.

If for whatever reason you dislike the buses, one could argue that this app allows you to avoid them by looking at your position, the buses' positions, and rerouting accordingly.

I've put up a small F.A.Q. that I wrote while developing and testing the app on my extremely underdeveloped website [here](http://roar11.com/portfolio/2bnb-android-app/).  There may be some answered questions there that aren't addressed here, or only come up as you use the apps.

Thanks to everyone who has already downloaded the apps and to those of you who are helping get the word out.

Thanks for all the feedback, and again if either of the apps give you any problems please let us know."	t5_2qpvj	True

I thought it might be a neat idea to use it as a neighborhood badge of sorts to let people know whereabouts you are located (if you want to; it's totally optional).

I put a flair on my name so you can get an idea of what it looks like.

Once I've gotten it set up, you'll be able to change your flair by clicking the edit link over there where it says ""Show my flair on this reddit. It looks like: [your username] (edit)"".

I have *not* implemented it yet, however, because I wanted to get a feel for places people want to see on the list.

I know it can be granulated down into a thousand pieces, but I tried to stick with the bigger and/or more populated 'hoods/areas. Here is the list I came up with (+ indicates I added it after posting the thread):

I live in Church Hill and now that the weather is nicer, and people are out in masses- so are the unleashed dogs. I happen to have a dog who is good on walks, and great with people, but he does not like other dogs. He doesnt go ape-shit, he is not outwardly aggressive towards other walking dogs- unless one happens to run right up to him unleashed. Leashing your pets when in public spaces is for safety, for you and your dog.  Bro has never bitten any dog in situations like these, but its stressful for myself, and all other parties involved when it does happen. The nasty reaction i usually receive because of this, doesnt help the situation either.
I do what i can to  actively avoid areas where i know dogs will be off leash- the entire lower level of Chimborazo, and a few other places, but i feel i should be able to walk adjacent to public parks, fields, and even houses without unleashed dogs running around all willy nilly. Its getting a little out of hand, as of late RVa.

For those that don't know, Saturday is ""Free Comic Book Day"" across the country. It's typically one of Velocity Comics' best days for business. All of the added security and lack of parking will make doing business WAY harder this year for the indie comic shop, and they stand to lose a lot of much-needed support. 

They're going to open super early at 9am on Saturday and give away A LOT of free comics. There will also be a 25% store-wide sale and select boxes of 50% off merchandise.

Velocity Comics is a great store, and they could REALLY use your help tomorrow. While other areas of Broad Street will be closed off, the store itself will be accessible via foot traffic at 819 W.

I decided to risk fate and take it outside, full ballast so it is nice and weighed down.  I do some controlled releases and it seems ok, so I start letting it fly thinking, ""Man, I sure am going to freak out the establishment around Church Hill with this!""

A cold wind blows... my shark rises too quick into the night sky.  I try frantically to control it, using the ""Dive"" position on my tiny controls and furiously flapping the tail left and right to generate force to push him down... but the range on the controls is minimal, and his responses come slow... and then not at all.  He rises, flying over my apartment building... disappearing from view.

I've looked around, kept an eye on the sky, and just can't be sure.  I don't have roof access, so there's a chance he's stuck up there, but I went onto the balcony and jerked the controller around listening for sounds from his motor indicating that he might be in range.  I heard nothing.

Odds are he'll rise into the atmosphere and pop before crashing down in a heap of mylar and cheap plastic motor encasing.  But just in case, I figured I should ask you guys.  Afterall, how many flying sharks could there be in Richmond?  If you see one, let me know, it is probably mine.

**tl;dr** - I let loose a flying toy shark in Church Hill that got away from me.  I fully don't expect to recover it, but if someone manages to find it I'd love to know.  He doesn't bite.

Some of you may remember earlier this year, in February and March, when there were several actions against radical anti-woman legislation.  On March 3, there was the largest protest at the Capitol since the days of Massive Resistance, resulting in the arrest of 31 men and women.  These actions were effective, and a lot of that legislation that had looked likely to pass was watered down, killed in committee, or voted against.

One of the bills (reappearing next session) would have granted personhood status upon conception - making not reporting a miscarriage within 2 hours a crime and outlawing several forms of birth control.  Another law (I believe it was passed) removed assistance for low-income women with high-risk pregnancies.  Another bill (voted against) would have stopped the shackling of pregnant inmates when they give birth - a traumatic and useless practice.  One that got a lot of attention was the transvaginal ultrasound bill (watered down and signed, IIRC) - this bill required women receiving abortions to get ultrasounds and see the embryo first.  The problem is that at the stage of pregnancy most women decide to abort, a regular ultrasound wouldn't satisfy the law.  So, a woman would have to have a probe inserted into her - this has been called state-sanctioned rape.

Having failed to make abortion completely illegal and lead us boldly forward into the early 18th century, the Republicans in Virginia came up with a new plan.  They are currently reworking regulations regarding abortion clinics, essentially forcing them to live up to the same standards as hospitals.  This is a solution without a problem, and in the end will result in the closing of all but two clinics in Virginia.  **This is exactly the same as banning abortion even in the case of rape and incest**, but only for low income women - those with the ability to travel to a less oppressive area may still do so.

Now, when this issue first came up, there were many actions regarding the Board of Health and they introduced a grandfather clause to allow currently-existing clinics to continue operating.  In a very shady manner, this grandfather clause was removed.  My guess is that it's a combination of string pulling from Ken Cuccinelli and John Seeds (a radical anti-choice member of the Board of Health).

On September 14th, at 7:30 am the Board of Health will vote on the new ~~legislation~~ regulations.  If this is an issue you care about, you should consider going.

UPDATE: 2/19 8 AM, I have been contacted by a few folks who are familiar with the dog and owner and have given them my contact information. I was made to understand the owner's situation makes contacting him difficult. I will be making an effort today to get in touch with businesses that he has been known to visit and let them know the situation and ask if they can help keep an ear to the ground or keep a lookout for the owner. George is doing well, my cat however is none too pleased about being quarantined for the time being. Thanks everyone for the help so far.

His name is George. He has a tag and the owner's name is Stephen but there is no phone number on the tag. He wandered up to my house which is a decent way from the fan district so my guess is he got away from someone visiting the area. I've tried percursory google searches, 411, ect but none of it has been helpful. I may have to end up driving to the the residence but I can't leave him alone or load him in a car at the moment.


There are a decent number of fan residents on r/rva so I figured there might be a chance someone might know his masters. If you do please confirm the address and full name that is on the tag in a message.

If you have any advice or know of any resources for me to reach out to please let me know, thanks.

Also, there are some great places to eat in the city. If you want some top notch BBQ you NEED to go to [Buz and Ned's](http://www.buzandneds.com/). Super good, virginia style barbecue, and it was on the food network in a throwdown with Bobby Flay (which it won). [Chez Foushee](http://www.chezfoushee.com/) is a really nice place and has some great food for both lunch and dinner. Edo's Squid is a real hole in the wall Italian place that has some fantastic food. For lunch/sandwiches nothing beats [Homemades by Suzanne](http://www.homemadesbysuzanne.com/). I had lunch once at [Millie's Diner](http://milliesdiner.com/) and thought it was quite good. [The Hard Shell](http://www.thehardshell.com/) is the best seafood I've had in Richmond and is worth checking out at some point too. [Capital Ale House](http://www.capitalalehouse.com/) has a huge beer selection and on Mondays they have $2 burgers which is a steal. [Bottom's Up Pizza](http://bottomsuppizza.com/) has some of the best pizza in town. I've never been to [Carytown Burgers and Fries](http://www.carytownburgersandfries.com/), but I've heard nothing but good things. [Ginger Thai](http://gingerthaitaste.net/home/) has great Thai food in Carytown.

Other things to do while in Richmond:


* 
[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.vmfa.state.va.us/Default.aspx)

* 
Go to [Carytown](http://www.carytownrva.com/). Lots of cool stuff there. [Chop Suey Books](http://www.chopsueybooks.com/) has a huge selection of used books, so it is pretty inexpensive. One Eyed Jacques has tons of D&amp;D stuff, chess, MTG, Warhammer, etc. Going to a midnight movie at [the Byrd](http://www.byrdtheatre.com/) is a MUST. [World of Mirth](http://www.worldofmirth.com/store/pc/home.asp) is a pretty quirky and fun place.

* 
Go to Belle Isle.

* 
Take a tour of [Legend Brewery](http://www.legendbrewing.com/). Also, [Corks and Kegs](http://www.corksandkegs.com/) has a pretty tremendous selection of beers.

* 
Go to [Lewis Ginter](http://www.lewisginter.org/). Especially at Christmas time.

* 
See a movie at the IMAX. Also, Movieland at Boulevard square is an amazing facility (It has [these!!!](http://i.imgur.com/a2FgZ.jpg)).

* 
See the [third practice electro-acoustic music festival](http://thirdpractice.org/3p11/index.html). It is a free festival at University of Richmond with tons of new music and some new commissions and is a very cool event. You should also go see contemporary super group eighth blackbird play too (either doing their own thing or at the festival).

That's all I can think of at the moment, but I hope this helps you out!

1320471795.0	m16dz	Need help finding driver of a hit and run accident from Sunday 10/30/11	Ohlio	39	5	4	"Hi Redditors of Richmond. A close friend of mine recently got in a severe hit and run accident in your city -- [a video of the story here](http://www.wric.com/global/Category.asp?c=190525&amp;clipId=6421161&amp;topVideoCatNo=92150&amp;autoStart=true) -- and I'm hoping one of you good people of the internet might have seen or heard something that will bring the driver to justice. 

The accident took place near the 1800 block of west Cary St (near Allen Ave) at 2:00am on Sunday, October 30th. The police are looking for a white compact car with damage to the front bumper. 

My friend, Emily, has extensive injuries all over her body because of the accident. She's been in surgery all of this week and probably next week too. She won't be able to walk for at least half a year. Emily is one of the most amiable and good-natured people I know and to have some asshole almost take her life without a look back is just infuriating. 

**If you have ANY information about the accident or the driver, please contact the Richmond police as soon as you can.**

Thank you so much for your help, Reddit. Stay safe out there!"	t5_2qpvj	True

Another user attempted to locate us, but we must have been behind some rocks cleaning. Anyway, with a total of four people, we [managed to fill up 12 bags of cans/bottles/trash (two more were left at the access bridge) in less than 2 and a half hours](http://i.imgur.com/5IeELBU.jpg). We are going to be planning another cleanup soon, probably 2 to 4 weeks from now, and I would like input from you guys as to what times and days (Saturday or Sunday) would be best for you for the most part. If four people can clean this much in this small amount of time, imagine how much could get done with a larger group. Let me know what you guys think. We want to get posters printed out and posted at the park, but it would be great if they could be posted in other prominent areas of Richmond, as several groups of people expressed interest in helping out while we were cleaning. Once we figure out the next date, we can get a poster together and get them spread around. Thanks!	t5_2qpvj	True

1362017095.0	19dad7	A not about downvotes...	Danger-Moose	85	52	48	"I saw a recent thread where there was some talk about the random, almost instant downvoting.  It does seem pretty pervasive on this sub, so I created a program to get some idea of how we rate compared to other subs.

Basically, I looked at the top 100 posts (not comments) and added up the total downvotes and the total upvotes and compared.

Here's how RVA rates:
Total Votes: 215
Upvotes: 135
Downvotes: 80
There are .59 downvotes for every 1 upvote.

In comparison, we are pretty close to some of the bigger subreddits (that constantly have crap posted, check out /r/pics/new sometime.)
Pics
Total: 585,686
Up: 327,366
Down: 258,320
.79 downvotes to 1 upvote

Smaller subs, like /r/baltimore:
Total: 404
Up: 358
Down: 46
.13 down for every up

/r/SanFrancisco
Total: 908
Up: 809
Down: 99
.12 for every 1

I'm working on translating this into a web app so you can check whatever sub you'd like.

For those who say karma doesn't matter, for the first time there have been posts that were new that didn't show right away on my default view of ""hot"" because someone comes in and immediately downvotes them.  It's annoying.

tl;dr: Our upvote to downvote ratio is kinda crappy, IMHO."	t5_2qpvj	True

Just because you don't agree with what the person is saying, doesn't mean you should downvote it. Reddit is supposed to be a community having a conversation.  I'm not advocating karma whoring, but upvotes for a link or comment indicate that the person has added something to the conversation.

It is depressing to see all the negativity, and I'm sure it has caused people pause when deciding whether to post something.  It reflects poorly on our community.

/end rant

Edit:  Again, to be clear, I do not care about karma for the sake of having karma.  HOWEVER, karma does cause things to float to the top and sink to the bottom.  THAT is why it is important.  This is a SOCIAL site.

1363918386.0	1arwzu	Maggie Walker Governor's School is facing some serious issues. I believe that education is one of the staples of a successful future, unfortunately the men and women from the surrounding counties who determine our budget don't agree. Please help me, fellow redditors.	brown_jesus	54	21	102	Maggie L. Walker's Governor's is an exemplary institution with great students and teachers. It takes in students from 11 surrounding counties, and we rely on a significant amount of county funds to keep the school running and operational. For the last 5 years we have been facing cut to our funding. In the last 5 years, Maggie Walker teachers have not received a single pay raise. Things are getting tight around here, and now teachers will have to be laid off because we need to keep the school operational and our amazing faculty can't afford another pay cut. The surrounding counties (Henrico, Chesterfield, Goochland, Richmond City, etc) have had steady increases in teacher's funds. Henrico has had increases in teachers' salaries, has opened 3 new schools in the last 5 years and wants to start cutting even more funds. If Maggie Walker loses too much money, it shuts down. It's an extremely special school designed to accommodate gifted students and help them thrive. This has been an extremely big issue and none of the politicians/directors in the other counties really seem to care. We're not asking for extravagant amounts of money (Thomas Jefferson High School will be getting an $89 million renovation), we just are asking for the counties not bleed us dry because of petty political issues. This is an extremely important cause to me, and I want to ask my fellow redditors to spread awareness of this issue. Also, if you guys have any suggestions as to how to solve this problem or help the cause, please feel free to share. Thanks reddit!	t5_2qpvj	True

1355602062.0	14wob4	Some thanks and some not so much	raskolnik	42	11	23	"My wife (a fellow redditor) was in a car accident this morning.  She's fine, other than being a little banged up.  The wreck happened because she was forced out of her lane by an 18-wheeler that changed lanes without checking his blind spot, and who then didn't stop when she hit the jersey wall at 70mph.  So the ""not so much"" is for him.  The other, but much smaller ""not so much"" is for the person who took a cell phone picture of her wrecked car as they drove past right before the tow truck left.

That said, I can't thank personally the following people, so this will have to do.  The three separate drivers who stopped to make sure she was ok, including one witness to the whole thing who waited 'til the police got there.  The Chesterfield County rescue squad who made sure she was fine and that there wouldn't be a fire.  The two Virginia state troopers who handled the wreck were exceedingly professional and helpful.  (If anyone knows folks who work for these organizations in the Colonial Heights area, please pass my gratitude along).

I'm also grateful for things like the [IIHS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety), and the fact that the state or county cared enough to put those jersey walls between the north- and southbound lanes of I-95, without which she would've gone into traffic heading in the opposite direction at high speeds.  I'll also give a shout-out to Dodge; her 10-year-old Neon did what it was supposed to do, crumpled properly, deployed airbags, everything.  So while the car had been a maintenance nightmare (due to spending too much time up north so the bottom rusted out), it performed where it mattered.

The perspective that comes with events like this is interesting."	t5_2qpvj	True

Someone else mentioned Pho So 1; their pho is bangin'.  I'm not opposed to a reddit meetup there, either, but they lack Mekong's ridiculous beer menu and the breadth of the food menu.

Perhaps some time after Thanksgiving? Before? My schedule is pretty open so I'll leave the date propositions to people with more restrictive lifestyles. 

**DISCLAIMER:** The owner of Mekong, An, is a buddy of mine, so I want to be transparent when organizing this. 

**EDIT** I showed An this thread a few nights ago, the same day I posted pictures from the rally to restore sanity; my sign was his slogan, ""BEER IS THE ANSWER"" and told him that we're kinda sorta ish the online community that helped maybe suggest that this would be a fantastic rally to have.  If you're a fan of him on facebook, you can see my friend (and fellow redditor) holding the sign as his profile picture :-)

Since someone suggested it, next time I'm there I'll ask about catering rates and let everyone know.

How does the weekend after thanksgiving sound to everyone?

**EDIT 2**
I meant the weekend *after* thanksgiving weekend, so the first weekend in December. I can't do the 26th/26th.

IronPlaidFighter	44	19	36	"The young church I attended since I moved to Richmond four years ago recently decided to dissolve due to declining attendance and too many leadership departures.  I have necessarily begun the search for a new congregation.

I'd like a church with at least a hundred congregants and a missional focus.  I believe people of faith should act out their convictions.  Larger churches provide a multitude of opportunities to find a niche.  I have always enjoyed getting my hands dirty on volunteer construction projects.

However, I would like a church that also places great importance on small groups (home groups, journey groups, commons, life groups, etc.).  Whatever you call them, they provide a space for community, a space where people regularly live life together.  I want to share meals, throw cookouts, and hear stories.

Ideally, I'd like to attend a church in the Near West End between VCU and Horsepen (plus Oregon Hill and Ginter Park), but I'll listen to any options.

Suggestions?

1375119642.0	1jaevd	Anyone interested in a 3D printing boot camp class in RVA?	RepRapRVA	33	9	55	"I have been putting together a beginner-oriented boot camp-style class where students work collaboratively in an instructor-led environment to build from scratch the most recent generation of self-replicating 3D printers, the [RepRap Prusa i3](http://reprap.org/wiki/File:Prusai3-metalframe.jpg).

The goal would be a four or five day boot camp with all parts and materials needed for the build included in the pricing of the class. The bot you would build would be a Prusa i3 variant with all of the most recent generation amenities including high quality extruder with brass hobbed bolt using the most recent generation MK-V hotend, an insulated MK2a heated build platform with precision thermistors for both ABS and PLA printing with Borosilicate glass build plates, high quality LM8UU and 608ZZ bearings for precise linear motion, precision cut steel smooth and threaded rods, an LCD-based control unit that can facilitate stand-alone 3D printing via the SD card slot, precision GT2 pulleys and timing belts, high quality and high torque steppers, etc.

The resulting 3D printer would be on par or more precise than the most recent generation of commercial printers such as the MakerBot Replicator 2. The benefits of the boot camp class should be fairly apparent, that the students would actually build from scratch their 3D printer so that they would understand intrinsically every aspect of it for precise calibration, troubleshooting, printing and adding updates and enhancements, etc. Based on the RepRap design, those printers are able to be ""reprinted"" for purposes of building a second printer for a friend or whatnot. The class would be delivered with each module of instruction on the overhead followed by lab exercise, to incrementally build, configure, tune, and then calibrate the printer by the end of the week. In addition to the all-inclusive nature of the class in terms of the 3D printer parts and materials included, the class would be delivered using a hefty boot camp book with companion lab exercise manual and detailed bill of materials including supplier contact particulars that could be used by the student as takeaway reference material and as a guide to build additional 3D printers.

Based on the complexity of the subject, very few people without extensive engineering background would be able to build their own 3D printer from scratch using locally sourced parts, and off-the-shelf commercial 3D printer variants are priced between $2000-4000 USD and are unable to be used to reprint themselves like the RepRap series of printers can.

The inclusive price point for the class is probably $1995 - 2495 USD, depending on how much it will cost me to source all of the parts, pay for each workstation's worth of tooling (soldering/reflow station, both metric and SAE toolkit, SAE and metric allen wrenches etc), pay the week's rental fee for a conference room at a hotel etc. Students would only need to bring themselves and a laptop, everything else would be provided in the cost of the class once I get the financial model worked out. The only prerequisites for attendance would be Windows 7 experience and the ability to use a soldering iron. If you are female, the soldering iron experience requirement is waived :)

The class would be delivered from the perspective of a complete introduction to 3D printing, starting with an overview of the foundational roots of the RepRap movement; an introduction to linear motion and the various types of 3D printing methods on the market (delta bots, cartesian, etc); the differences between additive 3D printing methods such as Fused Deposition Modeling and Stereolithography printing contrasted with subtractive methods of rapid prototyping such as CNC machining; an overview of the current state of the art in 3D printing, including a detailed tour of a functional Prusa i3 and all of its components, the theory behind stepper motor controls and and overview of firmware options (Marlin vs. Sprinter); connecting, testing, and flashing an Arduino-based control unit with the most recent Marlin firmware including hot end configuration, min/max temp variable configuration, thermistor selection and configuration, compilation of the firmware and flashing it to the Arduino; building the actual bot itself using industry best practices; then both coarse and fine calibration using digital calipers to optimize the build process. Other perks of the class would be a detailed overview of the most recent generation of open source software suites used to control and manage the 3D printing process including both Pronterface and Repetier, and Sl1c3r for model slicing. Bonus sessions would include overviews of how to navigate and download pre-built models from common sites such as Thingiverse, as well as an introduction to the mainstream open source CAD applications that are used to build prototype models from scratch such as [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/), [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), [Blender3D](http://www.blender.org), and the [Autodesk 123D](http://www.123dapp.com/) app for the iPad.

Is this something anyone in the RVA area would be interested in attending? The class would likely be limited to a maximum of 16 - 20 students based on the advanced nature of the class and need for one-on-one interaction between instructor and students.

If you would be interested in attending, what would the optimal hours be for the boot camp (8AM-5PM Monday through Friday), or maybe a 4PM - 10PM evening class that spans the week with a final weekend session on Saturday...?

PM me if you are interested with your email address so I can add you to a mailing list, I would like to put together an event probably in the Fan area or maybe at a nice centrally accessible hotel conference room with all the amenities such as room for the overhead projector and a separate table for each student to do the build.

I am shooting for the end of August right either right before school starts up again or during the second week of school, depending on the feedback I get on optimal scheduling and the demographic of interest in this very fascinating topic.  With enough space in the conference room where the class is being delivered, I might be able to include a ""bring your child"" provision if you want to attend the class and co-build the printer with your son or daughter.

Given the demand for 3D printing forecast by the industry, with enough community support this might also result in an industry-recognized certification offered through Pearson or Prometric testing locations to add to your resume after attending the class.

Cheers!

If you ask me, 2012 was such an AWESOME year for music in our city. It seemed that an essential album would pop up every month or so, followed by some downright incredible shows. My personal top five are:

1) Wolf/Goat - In Watermelon Sugar

I'm usually not that into the ensemble-driven, Americana-influenced music that is dominating the airwaves right now, but this record struck such a perfect balance between an Appalachian/rootsy vibe, a Modest Mouse-esque sense of desperation, and all out rock. The lyrics are gorgeous and reflective, the harmonies are warm and inviting, and the slow-builds are incredible and natural. If you haven't seen these guys live yet, do yourself a favor and get your ass to a show. I PROMISE that you will be entranced by the time they're finished with the first song. 

Having a song that celebrates the late, great Cellar Door also manages to inject a bit of community into the picture. So sick

2) White Laces - Moves

It took me a long time to get into this band. As much as I enjoy noisy, angular guitar-rock, I'm always on the look out for a solid hook and melody, something I never really picked up from their studio recordings. With their latest record, however, White Laces have finally become the band they have always deserved to be as they fully embraced a newfound sense of melodicism and atmosphere. Within seconds of the opening track, it becomes apparent that the band has reached a new peak of accessibility. It sort of reminds me of the later-day Sonic Youth albums, with super-catchy guitar lines cascading around equally-catchy vocal melodies without neglecting the attack of their earlier material. I haven't been able to see them live since the record came out, but I'm sure its quite a sight to see. 

This record has gotten a bit of national attention, so I'm crossing my fingers that they can keep the momentum going

3) Black Girls - Hell Dragon

I've listened to this record so many times since its release that it's hard to believe that it only came out in January of last year. As much as I enjoy their high-energy live shows, listening to their studio-recordings is an even more rewarding experience. Super-layered guitar lines never stop moving around what are easily some of the most infectious vocals in RVA right now. Psychedelic without being distracting and hugely soulful without seeming cheesy, this relatively-short listen is perfect for cruising Richmond streets with the windows down or sitting on the porch with a few brews. 2012 also marked the year that BG's went on their first National tour as support for the Head and the Heart, culminating in an AMAZING homecoming show at the National. 

I know they're working on new material right now, so I can only hope it's as good as their debut. 

4) Tungs/Heavy Midgets Split

No Richmond bands remind me more of the 90's indie-rock scene (Pavement, Dinosaur Jr, Sebadoh, Guided by Voices, etc) than Heavy Midgets and Tungs. Luckily for me, they decided to do a split together. Though both bands take sort of different spin on fuzzed-out guitar jams, the record never feels like two completely different beasts. Instead it marks just about everything I love about the bygone Matador-records era of yesteryear. The production is evenly appropriately lo-fi at times, giving the release a very raw and immediate vibe. I love it.

A few of the Midgets also have a project called ""Age of Asparagus."" They are just as good. I hope they manage to get some recordings down in 2013. 

5) Cheyenne - Secrets of the Cheyenne

As much as Tungs, Heavy Midgets, and White Laces seem to milk the college-rock scene of the 90's, Cheyenne is holding up a far-different flag, as they resurrect the glory days of classic emo. Channelling Braid, Texas is the Reason, and old-Sunny Day Real Estate, while all-the-while adding their own mathy guitar-textures, this band has immediately picked up a following within a considerably short amount of time. Working as part of the tirelessly productive Subterranea Collective and recently picked up by Worthless Junk Records, Cheyenne has done so much, so quickly. I cant wait to see where they head as 2013 rolls on.

They also have a small selection of wine, bagged coffee from Lamplighter, small batch soft drinks like ginger ale and whatnot, and some gourmet cheeses or something. But there's also beer!

I recently picked up some Sierra Nevada Hoptimum and a nice honey basil brew for the lady. They have plenty more, so give it a shot if you're in the downtown area for work or play.

It opened 27 years ago and is one of maybe 5 good video stores in the area, if that. We're a friendly bunch of people, family/friend run, and have an insane selection encompassing over 30,000 titles. We aren't limited to DVD either, we have one of the best cult classic selections on VHS. And our horror section is one to be feared (Bad pun). We're located at the corner of Jeff Davis Highway and Dana st, across the street from the Hull Street Outlet, and next to Sun Deli.

I'm with the West End Volunteer Rescue Squad here in good ol' RVA.  the name may sound deceptive, but we're not running around Short Pump, nor are we limited to the near West End; we're volunteers saving lives in every single neighborhood of our fair city, and we need your help NOW!

Like I said, we're volunteers, and a 501(c)(3) non-profit.  We provide emergency medical services, community training, disaster response, responder education...  The list goes on.  As a non-profit, we rely on donations to keep the lights on and the trucks on the street.

As we all know, the economy went to crap in 2008, and we've seen our donation revenue drop by a little over 70% since then. We've been living off of our savings, and they've finally dried up. If we can't drum up some public financial support, we're done. Our doors will close, and a 52-year legacy of service to people will be over.

If we close, the city will certainly be able to pick up the slack; but that's not what's important.

We provide job training and real-world experience to people who want to get into public safety, medicine, or any number of other careers... I can't tell you how many medics, firefighters, police officers, nurses, and physicians have turned out of our ranks over the years.

We train people in the community in how to save lives through CPR and first aid training.

We respond to mass casualty incidents, and provide another layer of preparedness in the event of natural or man-made disasters.

But most of all, we help keep the spirit of volunteerism alive. We represent what is still good about people. Our volunteers don't get a paycheck; we buy our own equipment, find our own uniforms, and spend our own money to get a lot of things we need, so that we can give time to help others.

My fellow Redditors, we've been helping people for a long time; now we need some help of our own. We may not be in your community, but you never know how far the ripple effect goes... One day, someone we trained may save your life, wherever you may be.

NBC12 in Richmond just did a story about us. It can be viewed here: http://www.nbc12.com/story/19057686/rescue-squad-needs-donations-to-stay-open

We have set up a dedicated fundraising site at http://donatetorescue.org, where you can learn how to help and donate online. Or, good ol' snail mail works too.

Even if you can only spare a buck, please do. Every little bit helps, and it all goes back to helping people."	t5_2qpvj	True

[Breakdown of School Budget Cuts](http://wtvr.com/2012/06/06/breakdown-of-richmond-public-school-cuts/)
This means decreased resources and support for teachers who have an increased level of demands placed upon them. In the interest of my classroom, I thought I would post a link to my DonorsChoose.org project along with a link to all the other DonorsChoose.org projects in Richmond City.

If you have not heard of DonorsChoose.org it is a great charity supported by Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central fame, that allows teachers to request community support for classroom projects that either can't be or won't be funded by school budgets.

[My Literature Project on DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/project/literature-circles/800429/)

This is the link to my specific project. Please throw it a few dollars if you can spare them. 

For those of you who live in other parts of the city and would like to support schools that are more local to you, please do! Below is a link that will help you find schools zoned for you.

I'm a media guy for the VCU student organization, Rams Community Bazaar (link to tumblr --&gt; http://ramscommunitybazaar.tumblr.com/ &lt;--). 

When we first had the idea of starting an on campus student &amp; community market that features businesses with a small and sustainable business model, we ran it by reddit. Partially because we wanted to get the idea out there and partly because we wanted to see if there was any interest in the RVA/VCU community.

We got some really encouraging responses from reddit, and it really gave us the fuel to power through the all the red tape and get the market off the ground. We have dealt with a lot on our road to launching the bazaar; our president came down with mono, our sponsor pulled out almost last minute, and one of our media guy (me) got hit by a car on his way home from a meeting, but with the help of the VCU (thank you green unity and the sustainability department.) and RVA community we were able to pull it off!

I'm not submitting this to reddit in an attempt to advertise 
(our organization is not going to profit off of this anyway), but just to let the reddit RVA community know about a really fun event going on in their neighborhood, its a good way to invest in the community and a fun way to celebrate Earth Day (prior to earth-day itself). 

That being said we are so excited to announce that our first Bazaar will be this Friday April 20th 10am-4pm @ Park Plaza (900 Park St.) and the Commons Plaza, VCU Monroe Park Campus!  This zero-waste event aims to strengthen the bonds between the VCU and RVA community, while promoting a  more creative and environmentally-friendly city. An diverse group of over forty exhibitors range  from VCU students and student organizations, to local artists, non-profits, and businesses.  To showcase Richmond’s creativity, an assortment of arts, crafts, foods, and eco-friendly products will be for sale at the Bazaar. Segway Tours, Upcycling workshops, Interactive Art, and a Bike-powered electrical generator are designed to educate the public and uplift the atmosphere of this family-friendly event. The Rams Community Bazaar will be a magnificent way to enjoy a Spring afternoon and support a few of the wonderful initiatives happening in the city!
 
(please be forgiving of bad spelling and grammar my arms broke in half and im high on pain meds, love you reddit!) 

TL;DR We started a sustainable student/community market @ VCU, it launches this friday, we had a rough time getting it started but reddit encouragement helped.  "	t5_2qpvj	True

1369794838.0	1f8s7r	shout-out to a badass Shockoe wheelchair jockey, you made my day	imgurigirl	28	4	3	"Earlier this evening as I was driving down Pear Street (at the far east end of Cary, connecting Main and Dock Streets), I saw you, a gentleman in a wheelchair pushing yourself up the very steep hill, towards Main. You made steady (but not slow) progress upwards, as a train crossed the street below.    

For an instant I considered offering you some kind of help, but I realized you were doing this very much intentionally. You were obviously in shape (aka totally ripped), and no one would just do that on a lark. Since my imagination runs a little wild, I did take the liberty of positioning my car behind you (down at the bottom of the hill, as I waited for the train to clear the crossing) such that if you had somehow slipped backwards, you would have rolled into my stationary car rather than the moving train. But no need, of course.    

You confidently wheeled yourself up the hill as I watched in my rear-view mirror, and allowed yourself just one quick backwards glance once you'd summitted. I get the idea you do this often, but it was a bit of a treat for me. I felt like I had just watched an Olympic event crossed with a death-defying action movie stunt scene.    

Wow. Kudos to you, random strongman. You are clearly an extremely tough guy."	t5_2qpvj	True

I've heard of people making the commute, but I don't know of anyone directly that does. I've looked at Amtrak Northeast commuter, but the prices are $33 dollars each way. Spending $130+ a week on the train isn't cost effective. I've seen bus service and VRE service, but they're all located in Fredericksburg. 

I really don't want to move to DC or even worst Arlington. Too expensive for what you get and too many boring lawyer types.

I called my land lord, gas company, and eventually the fire department.  Even though it smells like gas, they have assured me that that is not the case.  They have been getting calls from all over the city tonight.  According to the fire department, it's a strange smell but there is no harm in it.

TL;DR- It's not gas, go to bed.

original post text:
&gt; people in the fan and museum district might know pterodactyl.  these days, he's generally hanging out around the 3000 block of w. grace street.  right now, however, i can't find him.

&gt; has anyone seen him?!  here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/zGhbbP0) of him.  he has a typical brown tabby coat with a white chest &amp; underbelly.  there's a single white spot on his back and the pad of his front, right paw is black.

&gt; anyone who knows this cat knows that he's very much a dog trapped inside a feline's body.  he's very people-friendly and will follow you around on a walk or jump in your car for a ride.  if you have any information, send me a message or comment!

&gt; thanks × 1,000,000.

&gt; edit:  i have already checked animal care &amp; control on chamberlayne  and put a post up on richmond.craigslist.org, but would be up for any other suggestions."	t5_2qpvj	True
