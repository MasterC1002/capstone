I provided the police with the girl's name, facebook account and prior arrest records found online. They went to her house and now have the iPad. They didn't find the rest of the stuff stolen from my house but the iPad was the most expensive thing. 

They didn't say whether they arrested the girl but they did say they caught the guy on drug charges and they uncovered a lot of other illegal stuff.

Bonus: because of the reddit thread, 2 different local news agencies want to interview me for the story

"		273	56	69	"I was inspired to write my own iPad post after seeing the one in the link below. Being a student, it feels like this device was designed for me so I'm just sharing how I use it (and maybe you'll discover a couple useful apps). 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/w6r3x/today_i_had_an_ipad_moment/

During breakfast, I listen to the news through the NPR app and read the interesting headlines in the New York Times. I might peek at my personalized magazine, Zite, if the headlines aren't interesting. Then I review my day by looking at my To Do list through OmniFocus and I check assignment due dates in my planner, iStudiez.
	
I'll go to my first class (philosophy) where I'll pull out my Origami keyboard case holding my Apple bluetooth keyboard. I'll take notes through Evernote while recording the lecture at the same time. Then I'll go to my Logic class where I'll use Penultimate coupled with the Bamboo Stylus to write down my proofs by hand. This app syncs to Evernote so I have all my notes in one place. I'll use my two hour break to read a philosophy textbook on my iPad, then I'll go over my Psych notes using the Evernote Peek app (basically a flash card app for the smart cover). If I got any handouts, I'll scan them using ScannerPro. 

After classes end, I'll go to the library where I procrastinate homework. Instead, I'll read Wired, a novel or browse Reddit. On the trip home, I'll play a game like Kingdom Rush. At the end of my day, I'll watch the Daily Show on the Hulu App or rent a movie over iTunes while I eat dinner. The battery lasts me the entire day even while using 3G. 

My iPad has basically become my life. I can't leave anywhere without bringing it and I'd be glad to recommend any apps for students.

Guidelines to keep this working efficiently:

* Sort comments by ""top"" for best effectiveness. 

* Vote for (or add) Best-of-Breed you use, depend on, and recommend...**Why** do you like each, please be specific:  Best features, Key benefits?  How long have you used it?  What similar products have you tried?   

* Put the App Name as the first words when nominating new apps.

* **Search** for the app before creating a new nomination. 

* **Upvote** an app title if you like it, but **please comment** (reply) if you dislike, and explain why instead of downvoting.  If possible, give alternatives you like better. 
 
* Please orangered me to add a new category if you don't find one others could benefit from.

* If the app only runs on the New iPad, has a separate Retina version, is of the ""freemium"" model, or requires Cydia/jailbreaking, please state as such.

* Please put any general **[Suggestions, Comments, Questions Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/113gc3/ripads_favorite_apps/c6iywzd)**, thanks!

Vote for (or add) Best-of-Breed Apps you use **often**...  Apps you depend on...  Apps you recommend...  **Why** do you like each, please be specific:  Best features, Key benefits?  How long have you used it?  What similar apps have you tried?   

Only if needed, start a new **category** (under this one, or under sub-categories) for each app-family, e.g. Web-browsing, Note-taking, Weather, News... One main category head per family, with comments below... Add **apps**, then your **comments** via reply, below each heading or app...   

**Upvote** an app title if you like, but **please comment** (reply) if you dislike, and explain why, give alternatives...  Our votes *should* automatically sort topics and subthreads, dynamically, over time...

**Please add a new category (or app-name) only if you don't find one...**   
&gt;1. *Search first, if found, then vote; if not found, then add...*

App Crashing

WiFi Syncing

* If WiFi sync has trouble finding your iPad
   * Check your router settings:
      * Set the iPad to a static IP
      * Or increase the lease time that an IP is given
   * The Apple support forums have a lot of threads on the greyed out Sync Now button. Check them out for more information, or just Google your specific issue.
   * Sometimes restarting the Apple Mobile Device service helps

Corrupted Data, from crpearce

* Reset all settings won't delete any data, but flushes the cache to bring an iOS device back to nearly out of the box.
* Especially helpful if you need to do a full restore. Reset all settings, then backup. Your backup will be purged of all corruptible data before the restore process.


I shamelessly pulled a few tips from this [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/m2fub/ipad_tips_and_tricks/)

I'll try to edit this and add your suggestions as they come!

1341686466.0	w6r3x	Today, I had an iPad Moment.	Nihiliste	256	60	63	"I live in Texas, and today I had to take my car into the dealership for a state inspection.  Because I knew it would take at least an hour, I decided to bring my iPad and get some writing work done.  

I clipped my Ultrathin Keyboard cover onto it, stuffed it into my Muzetto Outback bag, and headed out the door.  Once I got there I set up the keyboard and Wi-Fi and got down to writing with PlainText, which was synced with the work I'd already done on my PC through Dropbox.  I had to check on some details for research, so I periodically switched back and forth between Chrome, which had thankfully synced my search history to speed up the process.  As a brief break, I played a turn in Words With Friends.

When it was time to go, without thinking, I just clipped the keyboard back onto my iPad, jammed everything in my bag, and went to the counter to pick up my receipts.  On getting home, I found the results of my extra work waiting for me.

My friends, this is how everything is *supposed* to go.  The experience was so seamless that I can only imagine this is what Steve Jobs fantasized about.  It was like a marketing cliche."	t5_2rgny	True

1343701689.0	xfdw6	My iPad has completely changed the way I learn, the way I practice and the way I teach music. Here are some of the ways how	GrandHarbler	214	34	69	"First off, I want to just say that my methods aren't foolproof or without fault. What I would like is to generate a discussion with all of you wonderful like-minded people about what I'm doing well, and what I could do better.

So, [here](http://i.imgur.com/FrF66.jpg) is my ""Music"" folder on the iPad. The two most crucial apps for my practice, and the most crucial for teaching however are contained in the [dock](http://i.imgur.com/I2ewg.jpg). My practice flow is governed by working on the goals set in [TaskMatrix](http://i.imgur.com/sRnQo.jpg) in 25 minute on/5 minute off units called ""Pomodoros"". 30/30 is a simple free timer app, which I sometimes have set up with all the goals per practice session defined, but often just like [this](http://i.imgur.com/fg8NX.jpg). 

One of the things I love most about this device is how well things work together. For example, I've been transcribing a lot recently. In the Music App itself I have all my music, and then the app title ""Amazing"" (short for ""Amazing Slow Downer"") will pull files from my library and enable me to slow things down, loop sections and pitch shift. When I'm doing this, I can [notate the transcription](http://i.imgur.com/PukVm.jpg) in a program called NOTION. The Amazing Slow Downer also works fantastically in tandem with iReal b. The backing tracks created with iReal b can be very cold and I believe that listening to the sound of fantastic musicians is integral to the development and maintaining of a good sound. I can learn new standards by looking at the chart in iReal b as numbers, and then pitch-shifting a great recording through 12 keys.

Apps such as Karajan and ReadRhythm are great for improving Aural and rhythm reading abilities respectively. GarageBand is probably the most effective composition tool personally and can be great for singing practice as it can lay out a melody or chord progression that I choose and I'll sing over the top. For more thorough compositions (anything that needs to be notated) I will again use NOTION. I was very skeptical about NOTION due to the large amounts of instruments that didn't seem to be included with the App purchase, but I haven't found anything that I want to use that wasn't included. 

A last note on practice routines using the iPad, [here](http://i.imgur.com/YkeKB.jpg) are videos I've taken during rehearsals. I often wonder how my technique holds up between playing and practice (where I use a mirror) and this enables me to listen back to playing that isn't being done for the sake of practice and analyze where I can improve and what is improving.

As far as teaching goes, Notability enables me to make sure my students are on track away from our lessons. I take all the lesson notes and make all lesson plans in the app itself, then in the completion of every lesson I email the student a PDF that contains everything we have covered that I still deem relevant. Using the camera I can photograph examples of hand positions, online I can lookup quick notations of simple exercises or I can do them up myself. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/gjSJf.jpg) and also [here](http://i.imgur.com/OCaIP.jpg) are some examples of how I set up notes for students. The annotated iReal b charts I do up in Skitch, and any annotated PDFs I create (i.e. transcriptions) I annotate with GoodReader. Speaking of [GoodReader](http://i.imgur.com/CyzHO.jpg), it's a far superior PDF management app and contains personally all the real books I could ever need, as well as extensive libraries of both classical and jazz method books in PDF form. It also contains my time sheets for work.

Lastly, I manage all my finances for my teaching and playing through my iPad, and wrote out this post using it entirely! Trying not to sound too apple fanboy but it really has improved my career no end having this device.

----------

**Edit:** I posted this over in r/wearethemusicmakers as well and in one of the posts I got talking about a couple other things:

""DM1 I actually left out a little bit from the original post, I don't use it as much as I should. I find it can be great for setting up [basic resolving polyrhythms](http://i.imgur.com/NgVal.jpg) and also because the feature for setting up sequential patterns means you can have say, four bars of drum machine then four bars on your own and see if you hold your time at the end of that. You can also set a similar thing up (and many variations of it) within the [metronome](http://i.imgur.com/Wl9i4.jpg) app.

iReal b I have now bought three times, I own it on iPad, iPhone and my MBP - it's really actually that good that I don't even mind having to buy the same software three times. Not only for my own (jazz) practice but I can write out backing tracks for songs students want to learn (or fragments of) on the fly - I can also of course loop the section they're learning at a slower tempo in Amazing Slow Downer, and then test their knowledge by pitch shifting it into another key.""

-----------

Also, people never seem to think of taking advantage of [iTunes U](http://i.imgur.com/0WYi1.jpg) - all this is free knowledge!! 

------------

**Edit 2:** I forgot to say that I use the PDFs from GoodReader and iReal b pretty much exclusively for my music for gigs. Any sheet music I need I either photograph or I scan it at home and import the PDF

**Edit 3:** I had a couple questions about tabs - Songsterr+ is the way to go in my opinion, it has MIDI playback of multiple instruments, you can highlight passages you want, the tabs are accurate and it has a large database of songs. UltimateGuitarHD I deleted yesterday because they want you to pay to access content freely available online, including through the iOS web browser. "	t5_2rgny	True

So far this is a list of changes I have notice on my iPad that were not announced. 


1. A completely seperate clock app, just like the iPhone stock one. Different interface but still does the exact same thing.


2. A new App store interface. Its a shade of black and there are some new fixes to annoyances with the previous app store.


3. When viewing a page of apps on the app store, instead of wasted space and pages of results the list uses the screens full real estate and shows more apps.


4. The purchased tab shows all of your apps and shows more as you scroll down, instead of the annoying page by page turn. 


5. When you download an app it doesn't exit the app store, instead it shows the progress over the app icon.


6. When a new app finishes downloading and you haven't opened it yet there is a small badge on the icon that says ""new""


 I will add more as I notice more changes. 


**edit 1:**


* Instead of the unattractive more options in safari, nine colored icons show up and give options like message, facebook, add to reading list, add to homepage. 


I know its hard to go on with no pictures. I will try and upload some later when I get the chance.


**edit 2:**

New way to view the apps. Makes sense this way instead of it always refreshing when you go back a page. 


http://i.imgur.com/j2xBr.jpg
On the featured page when you tap on an app you have the option to scroll back and forth between the next app.

Command and Conquer is mediocre at best. Red Alert hasn't been updated in a year and crashes constantly for a lot of people. EA just doesn't care about the gamers. I think the iPad is DESPERATE for some RTS games and I think blizzard is the one to do it. And even though they'd be remakes, I think the enjoyment of the original Warcraft games still holds together. There are many that haven't even played the older games, let alone an RTS. I would HOPE that if it happened, multi-player wouldn't have to be online, that it could be iPad-to-iPad WiFi play. Also the idea of touchscreen controls seems like it was made for the genre.

Guidelines to keep this working efficiently:

* Sort comments by ""top"" for best effectiveness. 

* Vote for (or add) Best-of-Breed you use, depend on, and recommend...**Why** do you like each, please be specific:  Best features, Key benefits?  How long have you used it?  What similar products have you tried?   

* Put the App Name as the first words when nominating new apps.

* **Search** for the app before creating a new nomination. 

* **Upvote** an app title if you like it, but **please comment** (reply) if you dislike, and explain why instead of downvoting.  If possible, give alternatives you like better. 
 
* Please add a new category (or app-name) only if you don't find one.

* If the app only runs on iPad2 or requires Cydia/jailbreaking, please explicitly state as such.

* Please put any general **[Suggestions, Comments, Questions Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/pvhoj/what_are_your_favorite_apps/c3skd34)**, thanks!

MachinesTitan	134	16	61	"Just to share with you guys, this was the first semester that I decided to bring my iPad to class with me in order to get better organized, take notes, etc.  I bought a $50 iTunes Card and went to work going through Apps, trying them, etc.  Here's what I have found:

**Organization:** iStudiez is the only app I've found that does everything I need it to.  I've heard some people call it an app for power users, but I find how in-depth it is fantastic.  Seriously, go get this app.  I think it's on sale for 99 cents right now.

**Note Taking:** Notebooks for iPad, currently $8.99, is amazing.  It has all of the note taking features oddly missing from some of the other note taking apps (like formating styles, bullet points, numbered points, etc).  It also has a lot of neat features that all work together, so you aren't stuck using certain features only in certain parts of the app.  The best part of this app is that you can process your note files into anything you want: RTF, txt file, or even PDF.  Doesn't matter what type of note you started, you can convert it to a new format as a copy, and then send it over to Dropbox or Box.

**Storage:** I love Dropbox, but I use it too much for other things now.  I do a lot of video and audio editing, so my account is maxed at the current referral rate of 20 GB.  It's constantly at least half full, and I have all of my other projects there.  Right now Box is running a personal account special of 25 GB for free, plus free syncing to Desktop.  I saw the link on Lifehacker over the weekend for the 25 GB account; you have to use that link, you can't sing up normally or you'll only get 5 GB.  You can open all of your notes into the Box app on iPad and then save them right there.  Done!

**Accessories**: Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard and Case, Rocketfish Stylus.  I got both of these at Best Buy, $100 and $10 respectively.  They work perfect for taking notes, and I really *really* like the the Ultrathin Keyboard.  The Stylus isn't the best response wise, but for handwriting and sketching it works fine.  It's not the best if you want to do actual artwork and whatnot."	t5_2rgny	True

The course is at [Essential-DPS](https://www.udemy.com/essential-adobedps/) and use the coupon code: **REDDIT4DPS** (which will apply a 100% discount and make it *free*).

Needless to say, it took a lot of time and effort to complete this course with over 45 lectures and 5 hours of content. It's built upon Udemy's powerful eLearning platform, and you can watch it online using your computer or iPad. Because of the length and quality of the content this course is regularly priced at $99.00 dollars, but I have created a special code for the reddit community to get it for free.

Please have a look and if you think this is something that might interest you, go ahead and give it whirl. If you like what you see, a nice positive review on there would be tremendously appreciated!

**TL;DR: I love my new iPad. I think it's perfect for the causal tablet user. Reasons below.**


In the interest of full disclosure, I should tell you that I am writing this review from my brand new iPad mini. I have been in possession of this device for slightly more than twelve hours; still, I feel compelled to write a review of my initial, genuine reactions to my new favorite gadget.

I have, in preparation for launch day, read scads of professionals’ reviews, from scathing to glowing. I’ve read up on the product specs, even though pixel counts mean virtually nothing to me as a newbie to the tablet world. I even google searched “best iPad apps” and made meticulous lists as to which apps I would download for my new device once I got my hands on it.This morning, I awoke early (no small feat for a college student) and drove out to my local Best Buy. I waited patiently for an available sales representative and declared my desire for a 16GB white iPad mini. I stood awkwardly in the store front as he went to go get one from the back - and then.

There it was, as pristinely packaged as all of the other Apple products that I have ever purchased.The iconic white box with its minimalistic sans serif font made me want to rip it open right there in the store - luckily, I had the restraint not to. I paid the $329 plus tax - a somewhat steep price for an 8” tablet - and proudly carried my purchase home in its blue plastic bag.

After arriving home and figuring out how to set up the charger (yes, I actually had trouble plugging it in), I went about my day, attending class as I let the little thing do its charging. After class, I could hardly contain my excitement as I walked back to my dorm with some friends; I knew it would be done charging.

Sure enough, when I clicked the power button, the battery bar read 100%. Excited, I unplugged it and got to work configuring the settings and downloading apps. I happily spent the rest of my morning and a good portion of my afternoon toying with the device. I played games on it, listened to some radio, and experimented with the note taking apps. I carried it with me to and fro, holding it one-handedly as I strode across campus or laid in bed.

I think it’s safe to say that I was bitten by the iPad bug: my first tablet, and I’m already obsessed with it.

Fan-girling aside, however, the iPad mini holds it own, even for the non-starstruck. At just under 8” (7.9”, to be exact), the iPad mini is the perfect size for a student like me: small enough to function as an e-reader, but large enough to use to surf Facebook when procrastinating on a paper. It lacks the near-laptop feel of my brother’s full-sized iPad 2, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. At this size, the mini allows or ease of handling when strolling through campus or sprawling supine on the couch. It is also lightweight enough to allow for this one-handed ease of hefting, which is a particularly nice bonus for students with heavy textbooks.

As for the screen, which has been the biggest complaint that I have heard, there is no problem. While I don’t doubt that a lower pixel count and lack of Retina display is a deal breaker for some, I haven’t found it to cause any issues. As a first time iPad user, I don’t know the difference, and think the screen crisp and clear enough for all of my reading, gaming, and video-watching needs.

Of much more concern to me, in fact, was the keyboard. I worried that, on such a small screen, the keyboard would be unnavigable, which would be a major drawback for an avid typist such as myself. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find the portrait-orientation to be the perfect size for two-thumb typing, which I have quickly grown to love. (As mentioned, I am writing this review on the iPad in question.) The landscape-orientation keyboard leaves something to be desired in terms of ease of navigability, being ever-so-slightly too wide for my thumbs to cover, but that is hardly a deal-breaker with the more convenient portrait-orientation keyboard. If a full keyboard that will allow you to rest all eight fingers on the home keys is what you desire, however, it’s likely that this is not the tablet that you are looking for.

And then, of course, we have the functionality. As an owner of a MacBook, I am comfortable with the Apple interface, though I found my laptop took some getting used to. Not so with the iPad. The layout is clean and intuitive, allowing me to very quickly organize and set up my device. I adjusted immediately to the ins- and-outs of the interface, grabbing and dragging apps and playing around with settings. As for the functionality of the mini as compared to other models, I can only speak based on brief experience with my brother’s iPad 2, but the experience does indeed seem to be the”full iPad experience” that Apple so proudly touted. Each and every one of the myriad of apps that I installed runs quickly and smoothly, seeming well adapted to my device.

Other salient points of the design include aesthetic value - the iPad mini is cute. My model is the white-and-aluminum option, and I’m not the only one who finds it overwhelmingly appealing. Already, I have received many compliments as to how “adorable” or “attractive” my mini is, and it’s only the first day that I’ve had it. The battery life is also nothing to scoff at: although I can’t speak for the long term, I can say that I have been using this little bugger almost constantly all day, and it’s yet to give out on me.

Finally, some would say that you should just spare the extra few bucks and take the plunge with a full sized iPad, but I disagree. The mini has its own advantages that make it more than just a shrunk down iPad. It’s in its own market, the market of the mid sized tablets, and rightfully so. And while the price might be exorbitant, I would be willing to argue that if you are looking for the iPad experience, then it is worth the incremental cost.

All in all, I think it’s safe to say that I am pro-iPad mini, for these reasons and more. And while I may just be a layperson goofing around joyfully on her first tablet, I like to think that my opinion matters as far as laypeople go - because that’s going to be a large section, if not the majority, of the market for the iPad mini. Not your tech gurus, but your everyday Dick and Jane, looking to add a functional, fun tablet to their lives. And I think that, with the iPad mini, Dick and Jane will like what they see."	t5_2rgny	True

1338950462.0	un93o	I'm the luckiest man alive, or at least my iPad is...	Connir	127	33	25	"   I went into the city tonight for a small choir concert my wife was singing in.  When I do such things I usually like to go early to secure a good parking spot and seat, as well as some quiet time by myself.  I opted to take my iPad 2 with me to do some reading or web browsing depending on wi-fi availability.  On my way out I stopped to clean out my car in the garage, and then grabbed cash at a drive-up ATM and dinner at a fast food drive through about 5 miles from the house.

   I noticed that after I ate dinner in my car and then left the restaurant parking lot, that my iPad was not in the car!  I quickly thought back to when I used the bathroom at the house and left it on the sink, and then tried to remember if I brought it into the garage with me but couldn't remember!  I pulled into a turn lane to do a U-turn thinking I should go check.  I then opted not too, talking myself into the fact  that I either left it on top of the car(where I usually place things while in the garage) and it fell off and is gone by now, or it's on the bathroom sink at home.

   I drove a little further and then realized my brain would be wondering all night so I needed to turn around.  I whipped a quick U-turn the next chance I got, drove home and lightly looked out for it on the side of the road, just in case it did fall off of the car.  I really convinced myself at this point that I'd left it at home, as that was the last place I really remembered it but I needed to rest my firing brain cells.

   Not seeing it anywhere along the road I get home and pull into the driveway with a little urgency.  I hop out of the car and head in, but think I should take a quick glance and see if by some miracle my iPad would be on the car, and IT WAS ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR!  Sitting there in it's leather folio, also inside it's zagg leatherskin, magnetic smart cover, and zagg screen protector.  It held onto the roof of the car for a good 6-8 miles of me driving around not like a crazy person but not gently either.

   I never made it into the house, I grabbed it off the roof of the car, said my little ""holy crap what if I'd lost it"" speech to myself, and made it back to the concert with 5 minutes to spare before the beginning...

EDIT: I should add, that if I hadn't turned around, a 65MPH road was in my near future on the way to the concert.  If I'd gotten to that road, I think I would've lost it for sure!

TL;DR drove around town for 10 miles with my ipad sitting in it's case on top of my car"	t5_2rgny	True

1. It doesn't get hot. Granted I haven't been playing Infinity Blade or anything, but I did activate LTE and download a bunch of apps. It got unseasonably warm outside here in the Northeast today and I don't have A/C. The iPad still stayed cool.

2. No WiFi problems. It gets a full signal in all but the furthest corners of the house. Basically the same performance as the iPhone 4. I have a crappy LinkSys router and it handles it just fine.

3. No light leakage.

4. The screen is awesome. I still think there is room for future improvement, but basically this is the best screen I've ever seen. I don't see any yellow tint, either.

5. Battery seems great. I still have 23% after 8 hours or so, and have yet to plug it in.

6. I didn't have an iPad 2 but the thickness and weight seem fine to me. It's much more light and compact than any laptop. To quibble over a fraction of a millimeter seems silly.

These articles are just grasping for straws over something to criticize. There's no problem here. This thing is basically perfect."	t5_2rgny	True

And if you're like me and you're a person who is already familiar with jailbreaking and it's become a huge part in your ios experience then you've probably been eagerly awaiting the latest jailbreak in order to truly enjoy the new ipad to it's fullest  potential.

So I've been enjoying the fruits of the iphone dev team and more recently chronic dev teams labor since the very first jailbreak available for the iphone 3G. I've been tweaking my phone a lot since then. and like I said, it has now become a necessity in order for me to really enjoy ios to the fullest.

I wanted to share a list of tweaks, some more essential than others, that I've put on my iPad, (some which I've been using on my iPhone for years now) that i've found make the experience more efficient, more productive and overall more enjoyable.

Why jailbreaking is so important (to me)

iOS is a really nice mobile operating system, but in some areas I can't help but feel that only the bare minimum was done. A lot of the time I'll be doing something in iOS only to ask myself in frustration,""Ugh, why can't I do this!"" or ""Why do I have to do it this way?!""

Fortunately for myself and many others, there are a number very talented developers who are capable of creatively addressing these issues. A lot of these tweaks will make you wish for apple to implement them one day. 

Without further ado, here is a list of tweaks that all jailbreakers (especially you newbies) should be aware of!

The essentials:

1) SBSettings from Bigboss - Free

Sbsettings use to be the tweak if you were going to jailbreak your idevice. It really brought to my attention early on what developers could achieve on iOS. SBSettings very conveniently places important setting toggles such as your data connections, bluetooth, and even a slider for your brightness right on your springboard. Just evoke the window (by default sliding on the status bar, customizable in activator..more on that later) and you're ready to quickly change any of the available settings normally only accessible by going into the settings app itself. And it's fully themeable! This use to be the tweak I used in order to convince my friends that owned iphones to jailbreak their devices. 
Since the introduction of notification center in iOS 5, SBSettings toggles can be placed into the N.C. itself, giving you the option of whether you want a separate sbsettings drop down window. I personally have replaced SBSettings with intelliscreenX, though sbsettings still serves a vital purpose as it gives you the ability to toggle mobilesubstrate addons (allowing you to disable your tweaks without uninstalling them.)

2) Activator from Ryan Petrich - Free

Activator is an amazing tweak that adds a whole slew of gesture based options to improve your iOS experience. Essentially you select a gesture (from a long list of available ones–ex. doubletap status bar, pinch springboard…) to act as a shortcut for you to toggle/access practically anything on your phone (sbsetting toggles, specific app options (like skipping to the next track in itunes), system options (simulate pressing the home button), or even launch an app! Activator even gives you the option to choose where these shortcuts can be triggered from. It's really hard to describe in words, but it truly is one of the essential tweaks for any iDevice.

3) FolderEnhancer from Ashikase - $ 
FolderEnhancer is one of those tweaks that makes you wish it was just natively available in iOS. Amongst many other options, FolderEnhancer frees your folder from size limitations (now allowing for pages upon pages of apps) as well as enabling the ability to store folders in folders. You can even adjust the appearance. Simplify your spring with this essential tweak!
Note: You're probably going to want the No Folder Badges tweak from chpwn (free) to eliminate any possible annoyance.

4) Multicleaner from da_petcu21 - $0.99

The description of this tweak is as blunt as it is well said. ""Because iOS multitasking sucks…""
Multicleaner is another one of my essential tweaks that I simply cannot live without. Configure the multitasking bar in any number of ways to make it work the way you want!  Now, there are many tweaks available for ios' multitasking bar, some even free, but this one is without a doubt the best one in all of cydia. It gives you all the options you could ever want; my personal favorites are 
a)reorder the icons without having to go into edit mode.
b)don't just minimize out of apps, quit apps with a simple activator gesture (by default, holding the home button) 
c)show current app in switcher (I was always bothered with how as long as you were in the app, it would be hidden from switcher)
d)SWIPE APP OUT OF SWITCHER BAR TO CLOSE IT! Definitely my favorite option! Sometimes I find myself with countless apps open and instead of having to go into edit mode I can now slide them out the switcher bar like a bashing a puck in a game of air hockey!


5) MultiIconMover from Ashikase - free

Another tweak that should be available natively in iOS. Move multiple icons on the springboard simply by going into edit mode, tapping each icon to make a checkmark appear, and then hitting the home button once you are ready to replace them. Simple.

6) Swipebright from IanP - $0.99

A new favorite of mine, Swipebright allows for the quick adjustment of the brightness instantly just by swiping your finger horizontally on the status bar. There are plenty of options available which is surprising because I found swipebright was pretty instantly perfect. Ain't no harm in making a good thing better!

7) Zephyr from chpwn - $2.99

Another new tweak that I instantly fell in love with, zephyr improves on the iPads native multitouch controls and allows for more intuitive way to handle your multitasking. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen will pull up the switcher bar, swiping left to right will switch between apps. You can adjust the number of fingers you have to use and you can even disable it during certain applications. Quite simply, but incredibly useful

8) IntelliScreenX from intelliborn - $9.99

Check your mail, rss feed, twitter, Facebook and even toggles for the most common system settings and more!
IntelliScreenX adds a plethora of new features to the notification center. This tweak is incredibly well done and definitely worth every penny.

9) iFile from Carsten Heineit - $

An incredibly important app, iFile is the ultimate iOS file system explorer. 
You can even start up a web server with one touch so you can transfer files to and from your idevice without ever plugging it into your computer. Very cool.

10) Fullscreen [safari] for iPad from Yllier - $

This tweak improves safari immensely and in my opinion makes it better than all of the browsers you can find in the appstore. I wish apple would have done something like this to keep safari from being so boring. Add multitouch gestures to control the browser or use the actionpopup for quick access to the (customizable) browser controls.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNRUdlTILxc

11) Adblocker from Yllier - $

Adblocker for safari as well as other apps. Can't live without adblocker on my computer, and I'm glad I don't have to live without it on my mobile devices.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCtm6vPWdxg

12) Scrollingboard from Elias Limneos - $

Scrollingboard is a tweak that completely transforms your dock. This add-on will give you paged scrolling of your icons on your dock as well as giving you extra functionality with downloadable addons. This is an incredibly well done tweak and one of the most expensive. Definitely worth checking out.

The Honorable mentions

i) Apptivator from n00neimp0rtant - 

Assign activator actions onto app icons. Terrific for clearing up space on your springboard. Use by double tapping icon to launch. My favorites are double tap appstore to open cydia, settings to open file, and alienblue to open flipboard.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ys_PIsItmk

ii) Blutrol  from r. Wetzel &amp; M. Ringwald - 

Control your favorite games with the iCade arcade Cabinet. Pretty simple! Find a game that doesn't support your iCade, take a picture while in game and set the control functions in the blutrol app. Support for more controllers, including the Phonejoy, coming soon in version 2.0!

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh9Cf6kSoz4

iii) Springtomize from FilippoBiga - $2.99

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5nQO1inag

Customize your springboard to make it look and feel the way you want. Tons of options- Favorites include Turning notification transparent, removing the newsstand icon and replacing the dock with no dock.

note: If you want to remove newsstand without paying for a tweak, use NoNewsIsGoodNews

iv) Software Update Killer from  Lunatik - free

Disable software update; hide app badges.

v) NoLockScreen from Tom Zickel - free
Disables lock screen. Locking and unlocking your device shoots you right into springboard, no slide to unlock necessary.

vi) OpenNotifier from n00neimp0rtant - free

Add status bar icons to push apps. I prefer this over getting some noise or dialog box.

vii) Protube HD from Jonas Gessner - $

Complete Feature-filled youtube app for ipad.
Note: use in tandem with Open in Protube for best experience.

Fast forward to yesterday when I tried to re-download the app and was told I'd need to pay for it again.

iTunes support keeps telling me that because I purchased the app on the US Store, I can't download it on the Canada store. But if I try to go to the US store, it won't let me download anything as my address is now in Canada.


Anyone have any suggestions? The easiest thing is probably just for me to jailbreak my ipad and pirate the app that I've already paid for. 

**Edit:** I've discovered that it's about $40 in apps that I'm missing from my time in the US. Also, Apple does not provide phone support for this issue. You cannot get a live person on the line to deal with iTunes billing. Also, to the person downvoting me, mind telling me what you find so offensive about this issue? 

**Edit 2:**  To everyone telling me that I can get 2 accounts for 2 countries: yes, I understand that. The problem is that I have 1 account and I moved. Had I known that it would be this much hassle back in 2010, I would have just created a second account for Canada.  
  
The issue has been resolved. Here is what happened: I can still download the app for free, but it *looks* like I'm going to purchase it. I need to confirm a purchase with the green 'buy app' button and enter my password. Only then does it say that I've already purchased this app and it'll be downloaded for free. This only happens with apps that I purchased in the US store. Apps I have purchased in the Canadian store show up under my 'purchased' section in the App Store. 
  
The iTunes support rep was completely wrong in telling me that I would need to re-purchase the app again. It took an escalation to a supervisor for me to get a solution that 1st level support should know. I also find it aggravating that you cannot call into Apple for billing issues. The big sell for Apple is supposed to be excellent support. I think they really dropped the ball today with my issue. "	t5_2rgny	True

CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW INCREDIBLE TECHNOLOGY IS THESE DAYS? That shit was not only the most beautiful thing I'd ever experienced on my iPad ever in my life, but it was the most engaging puzzler of a game I've ever come across ever. I actually don't think I put the damn iPad down once from the start until I finished the whole thing. I was just in awe the whole time and couldn't stop. It was perfect. I realize I probably I sound like an ad right now, and I don't even care. I'm not even going to apologize because it is just that good. If you haven't yet experienced the magic of The Room, stop what you're doing immediately and download that shit. I don't care if you're in the middle of doing surgery or finding the cure for cancer – all of that can wait. So DO IT. NOW. 


  Anyway, a sad post-effect of delving into the magical realm of The Room is that now all the games I've played since are depressingly sub-par. I want other mesmerizing mystery puzzler adventures, and the only satisfactory above-average games I've found since The Room have been from the Drawn series. So I come to you, oh ipad connoisseurs, in hopes you might have some recommendations of games along the Drawn/The Room-type puzzle games. 


   The only criteria I have is that I despise games disguised and advertised as adventure point-and-click puzzlers that seem like the kind of game I want, only to end up being mostly a bunch of hidden-object levels with a storyline only the objects mostly have nothing to do with the story or tasks at hand, and mostly just act as plugs to make the game seem longer. I don't play that game. Waste of my time. But there are so so many of these hidden-object decoys out there..


   **TL;DR/Conclusion: So ladies and gentlemen, i'd forever be grateful if you could steer me toward games similar to The Room or the Drawn series that aren't undercover hidden-object games. You guys rock. Finally, thanks in advance from the bottom of my heart.**"	t5_2rgny	True

SavageInteractive	78	11	62	"Thanks to everyone who has purchased Procreate and been contacting us with your thoughts and suggestions. It’s been brilliant waking up to your constant ideas, praise and suggestions over the last 3 weeks. Today we have made a decision with Procreate, and we thought we would be open and transparent with our growing number of users.


**Fraudulent behaviour**

The App store is a marvellous place. Indy devs like Si can compete with the big boys. And we couldn’t be happier with what we’re doing. The app store also brings with it, some politics and nuances. Particularly the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in, where competing developers do some unscrupulous things in order to stay ahead.

There have been individual(s) who have been attempting to discredit Procreate, in the United States App Store. They have marked all of our great 5 star reviews as unhelpful and some have even gone to great lengths to promote other apps, whilst writing false information in reviews about Procreate. Apple thankfully, came to the rescue removing the review and have begun a full investigation.

With the release of v1.02, its unfortunately happened again. Within an hour of the update being available, we all of a sudden had 4 x 1 star ratings added to our tally and someone had marked all of our updated reviews as unhelpful once again.

In the days following this last attempt to mislead customers, our sales have taken a massive hit, to the point where we’re between a rock and a hard place. We’re a start up company of 4. No fancy VC cash or investors. As such we depend on making solid apps and day-to-day sales are vital for the long term success of Procreate.


**Procreate. Free for a limited time**

Our next step, is drastic but necessary, to try and get genuine reviews back on the store. We’re going to reduce the price of Procreate for a limited time, to free. Hopefully new customers will leave honest reviews for Procreate and we can drown-out these competing developers.

What better way to combat haters than with some love!


**Let’s tell everyone about Procreate!**

Please remember, your purchase has already helped make Procreate better. We already have some really cool free stuff headed your way soon. This is a limited time offer. So if you haven’t tried Procreate yet – now is your chance! And remember to leave a review on the iTunes store!

Let’s beat the Procreate drum and get some honest reviews going again!

You can find Procreate on [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498?mt=8) and for even more info on the app, check out [our site](http://wwww.savageinteractive.com.au/Procreate/).

Cheers,
Si.

*TL;DR: Procreate is free to try and combat some suspicious circumstances. So get it now!*

**EDIT:** Whoa. Reddit is AMAZING. We woke up this morning (not so long ago, as we're in Australia) to see all of you awesome Redditors jumping on board to help us out. This really is incredible and we'd like thank every last one of you. It goes to show something great can come from something crummy. We really can't express our gratitude...

On top of the crazy response from you guys, we found Apple had also removed our most recent attack too. Obviously they acknowledged we were being targeted again, which is great news. If there are any other devs that have experienced this against you, let Apple know as they appear to listen if it's as obvious as it was against us.

Thanks again, Reddit.

**EDIT 2:** After the phenomenal response from people of Reddit and the interwebs in general, we have beaten this, surely with no chance of sabotage from here in. we will be flicking the switch back to normal price in 1 hour, so if you know anyone that would like Procreate for free, pass it on now! Cheers!

**EDIT 3:** To everyone following this, the switch had been flicked and we're back at the old price now. In the US Store we got to #4 in top free apps, and even #1 in many countries. The reviews you guys left were off the show, and we're a 5 star app, with over 130 ratings. This has well exceeded all of our expectations and we are certain that we can sustain any further attacks with this kind of buffer, should they happen.

Redditors, the community spirit you have shown was incredible. You have made 4 iOS devs extremely relieved and we thank you immensely."	t5_2rgny	True

--------
Well with just learning to play Civ 5, I've become increasingly hooked on the game.  Of course with the computers lacking at work, I wanted to be able to play away from home.

Remote playing came across my mind.  I've known Splashtop's self-adjusting quality streaming capabilities have been top notch for a while.  Its been great for movies, so naturally I wanted to see how the game would play on it.  With Civ 5 being turned based play I figured it would be the best candidate.  It has got no real need to react quickly, so even if the streaming was a little slow it should be fine for issuing commands.

Anyway, the key is to get Civ 5 into Windowed Mode @ 1024x768 on the remote PC.

Also get Splashtop to display at 1024x768

*Text Editing/Note-Taking*

* **$0.00** [PlainText](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plaintext-dropbox-text-editing/id391254385?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [SpringPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/springpad/id360116898?mt=8#) Always forgetting stuff? Need to take a picture to remember for later? Don't have time to dictate what your teacher says? SpringPad is a quick, efficient version of EverNote.

Classes like Biology and Anatomy, as well as several graphically inclined classes will love this app, since all the pages allow you to draw and write on them. You can also use different kinds of pages, like college ruled and graph paper. The app comes with separate notebooks, so you can keep track of different classes with different notes.

* **$4.99** [NoteTaker HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/note-taker-hd/id366572045?mt=8) Import what you need, and export what you made with this high quality note app. You can zoom to write, and insert your own images, and best yet, you can display notes on a TV or projector.

Designed at the core to let you draw, type, and record a lecture all at once, in case you fall asleep, missed a bullet point, or just felt like doodling the whole class.

* **$4.99** [UPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/upad/id401643317?mt=8#) Probably the best bang for your buck. This app takes full control of any note takers dreams. Cornell Notes, drawing, typing, writing, outlining, everything. Simple, and it comes with a great UI, available for cloud syncing as well as TV output! This really pushes competition for any note-taking app.

*Schedule/Course Load*

* **$0.00** [BlackBoard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackboard-mobile-learn/id364252826?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [Wunderlist](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist/id406644151?mt=8)

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [inClass](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inclass/id374986430?mt=8) Excellent organizer app. This has a combination of great app features in one place, and is my main study hub. The organizer can keep track and remind you of exams for classes, and can let you know of homework due. The notes portion is also a cool feature because it automatically knows what class you are taking and drops the notes you take in that class (based on what time you put your classes, it knows when that time is). A side note, you can also record full lectures while taking notes!

* **$2.99** [iStudiez Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istudiez-pro/id310636441?mt=8) Definitely considered for the power user in mind. A rival to inClass, this app is for the multi-device/""I left my iPad at work"" user, because of it's multi-sync ability, and a dropbox enabled usages, you don't have to worry about needing your iPad everyday at class. All the same features from inClass can be found in this pretty app, as well.

* **$0.00** *$0.99 Ad-Free* [Grades 2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grades-2/id427900301?mt=8) Can you stand to make less than a B on your final to pass that History class? What if you fail the mid-term for Chem? Or maybe you didn't turn in that homework assignment for Spanish? If you spend more time worrying what you don't NEED to do, grab this free app to keep in check with your grades. Grades 2 can predict how well you will do in class, even if your teacher can't. As a bonus, you can get notifications on upcoming tests and assignments!

* **$0.00** *Textbook purchase* [Kno](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textbooks/id424280183?mt=8#) It's free, but it'll still cost you anywhere between $60 to $200 dollars for textbooks. This app is like an advanced iBooks for your textbooks, allowing you to annotate, study, and even quiz directly from the book you are using. The system is a bit short on books (only 100,000 some odd books, so you may not find all of your books), but the books it does have are extremely current. If you really want to drop the books altogether, this app is for you. (Mind you, grants will NOT pay for these books.)

*Paperwork/Storage*

* **$0.00** [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8)

* **$4.99** [GoodReader](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodreader-for-ipad/id363448914?mt=8#) A step up from iBooks, this PDF/file editor lets you go beyond reading, by allowing DropBox sync, highlights, linkable pages (like a table of contents!) and even ANNOTATIONS. The most important function of any PDF viewer. If you annotate your teacher's pages like crazy, this one's up for consideration.

* **$9.99** [iAnnotate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iannotate-pdf/id363998953?mt=8#) Stepping up further is iAnnotate, when you've got a huge list of PDFs to sort/annotate, you'll want to pay the extra $5, since you'll get a global power seach through ALL of your files, as well as a huge assortment of annotation tools (this is an ANNOTATION app, right?). Pick this up if you've got to take notes on that 85 page document your teacher assigned to read over the weekend.

* **$9.99** [Pages](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8)

* **$0.00** [DropBox](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8) Another useful app to keep yourself organized between school and home. Use it to create a separate doc folder to quickly keep files and docs between your iPad and your Desktop. Forgot that paper at home? Not if it's in your DropBox folder!

*Tools/Accessories*

* **$0.00** [TouchCalc](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchcalc/id286091993?mt=8)

* **$0.99** [HiCalc HD](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hicalc-hd-pro/id442665708?mt=8) Includes all the calculators!

* **$14.99** [Papers](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papers/id304655618?mt=8) Research any subject easily, even store articles to reference to.

* **$0.00** [Noterize](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/noterize/id364906681?mt=8#) I put this down here because you can get a 15% discount on the PogoSketch (see below). This app is a free, full powered PDF editor/notation. For the price of free and a 15% discount, this is a must get for you annotators. Freehand highligh/sticky note all your PDFs and even directly download them from the built-in browser!

* **$14.95** [PogoSketch](http://tenonedesign.com/sketch.php)

* **$9.99** [Keynote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8)

Those are my essential apps. Leave a comment about any other apps you feel best for school, and I'll keep the post up to date for other student-redditors. Also, if you've got any tips/tricks to staying organized, leave them here, too!"	t5_2rgny	True

I put a few photos, movies and an album and a few PDFs for a test. Started Dawn of the Dead on iPhone 4 and was browsing and checking out the iOS app that accesses the drive on my iPad mini. Pulled up a PDF, didn't pull up a picture but looked and they were there. Dawn of Dead never had any problems, but the drive was right there. Decided to play a movie I bought from iTunes on my iPad mini, Signs, and it worked, plus I was streaming two movies to two iDevices at same time. 

Right now I'm copying over more movies. Pretty early but so far it beats my expectations: I was mostly aiming for just movies and wasn't sure my iTunes bought media would work. And I wasn't really thinking about general documents or pictures. 

Only downside is you need to switch to their wifi signal so no Internet. While not noticed during a movie I guess listening to music while accessing web is out. "	t5_2rgny	True

Finger Tied is a multi-touch puzzle game where you use up to 4 fingers at once to fill in shapes on the screen. Finger Tied can be played entirely by yourself, but for even more fun, invite some friends over and Finger Tied makes a great party game!

I'm an independent game designer and developer and I've been making iOS games for over 4 years now. Finger Tied was featured by Apple in the US store and moved up the charts quickly. This is the first time Apple has featured one of my games like this, so it has been very exciting. The game has also been getting extremely positive reviews from sites like TouchArcade, TUAW, 148Apps, and Mashable. 

*But, it's currently stuck at #8 in paid iPad apps in the US, right behind Angry Birds Space HD (curse you, birds!) ;-) With your help, we can push it higher!*

Finger Tied is currently 66% off as a launch sale. That's $0.99, reduced from it's normal price of $2.99.

If you have any questions about the game, let me know.

does anyone have a solid website with a library of videos comparable to sidereel that can be watched on ipad?

On the iPad, however, there is no free version of Alien Blue. On the iPad it's called Alien Blue HD and it runs for $3.99. I figured that since I enjoyed the iPhone version, I might as well buy the iPad version. And I love it. Definitely worth it. It makes browsing reddit even better than the browser version.

I've been considering buying either an AppleTV or a Roku box to stream Netflix and Hulu. I would really love to cancel my satellite service altogether at some point in the near future and just stream those shows I want to watch. Anyway, I was at Best Buy the other day and I bought the iPad HDMI adapter for $40. It allows me to connect my iPad to my TV as well as having a pass through for the dock connector so I can charge my iPad while it's connected. I am now watching Modern Family, Downton Abbey, Breaking Bad, etc in glorious HD without having to shell out $100.

I'm going to give it a month or two to see how much I really do use it once the novelty has worn off and I will likely go ahead and buy an AppleTV, but for a temporary solution the iPad is working great. The only downside is that there is no remote so I have to get my lazy ass off the couch to pause or go to the next episode ;-)

There are plenty of apps out there that password protect your photos and videos but they are usually way to obvious. Any app that can store media and asks for a password at launch is a dead giveaway that you have porn on this iPad! We need an app that hides that there is even password protected content.

Presenting [Private Albums](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/private-albums-photo-video/id384617809?mt=8) from Hedonic Software.

The good thing about this app that looks completely innocent when you use it normally. Just a great app to download and store documents.

The way it works is that you have to login to open your files. Default without password protect. The great things is that you can create hidden accounts that are only revealed is you tap with 3 fingers in the login window. So by default I have a guest account, my personal account with innocent files and my hidden ""System"" account that holds my porn collection.

Other features:

* Generic app icon and name (""Albums"")
* Hardware encrypt your files + exclude from backup
* Decoy passwords: Still won't show the files in a hidden account when login in with a decoy password instead of the real one
* Hack protection: delete the account or show the guest account when failed to login 5 times
* Organize files in folders + search functionality
* USB and Web transfer or transfer via Dropbox
* Boss mode: tap with 3 fingers to quickly show a generic Google map
* Expands archives (ZIP, RAR, CBZ and CBR)

There is also the [Stash](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stash-private-photos-videos/id364575517?mt=8) app that has a free version and adds a private browser but the ""st@sh"" name under the icon is a bit more obvious in my opinion."	t5_2rgny	True

Heavy web sites like Facebook (I prefer to not use third party apps and yes, I use FB despite disliking it), and Google+ is the most noticeable. Wow! It's as if someone replaced Safari's engine.

I have purchased my iPad from them and they seem to be a legit Apple authorized reseller. They have Apple banners/advertising material everywhere.

1310077217.0	ijgmg	"Here's the bypass for the TWC application's ""jailbreak"" protection, and instructions on how it was accomplished."	dissidents	54	6	42	"Time Warner Cable's iPad application recently had an update which [prevents people from using it](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ij0rn/twcs_app_doesnt_work_on_jailbreak/) if it detects that your device is jailbroken.

I created a bypass which can be downloaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?69r98juwrhbassw).

1. Uninstall the application from your iPad.
2. If you don't have it already, use Cydia to install AppSync from the **cydia.hackulo.us** repository.
3. Reboot your device.
4. Double-click the downloaded .ipa file above and sync the application to your device.

-----

I don't know exactly why Time Warner wants to play games with paying customers. If they're doing this because the streamed content could be stolen, there are many more practical and well-established ways of ripping TWC content than over an iPad app, as [robhue](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ij0rn/twcs_app_doesnt_work_on_jailbreak/c246o71) points out.

Additionally, a jailbroken device is no indication you intend on ripping streamed content anyway. If anything, preventing jailbroken users from using the application entirely will only increase the chances of people cracking the application and stealing streamed content. What are they thinking?

In case another company comes along and tries to do this again, I'll point out how they did it. Their developers must have googled ""detect if device is jailbroken"" and got [this](http://petersteinberger.com/2010/03/detect-if-an-iphone-is-jailbroken/) page. They used a similar method, and actually had a debugging setting that allowed *their* developers to use the application on a jailbroken device, but nobody else. LOL

As I suspected, it checked for apt and Cydia. All it took to bypass this was to corrupt those path strings (replacing them with underscores with a hex editor) and resigning the binary using ldone (which can be found on the cydia.hackulo.us repository as well).

If you have any problems (or questions) with the patch, let me know. I can't really test it since I don't have TWC, but I looked over the disassembly output and I'm pretty sure the patch is straightforward.

Until I saw the specs. 

They aren't up to par with other tablets but Apple's great at optimizing things so I assume it still works well. But I'm obviously not going to spend $330 based on assumptions.

Original Post:


I've put 10000 books on my iPad 3 5.1.1 for the hell of it. iBooks wouldn't run so I decided to delete them since my storage is full of books. I can't get rid of them. I have the settings on manual syncing. I deleted all the books from the book category in iTunes and tried syncing. The syncing succeeded but the storage is still filled with books. The books are gone at the books category in iTunes. I can't even add new books now.

Simply, yes. I do notice.
Does it bother me? Not at all.
The DPI on the mini is the same as the original iPhone (I believe, correct me if I'm wrong). The original iPhone was held closer to your face than your iPad normally is. I feel like this makes the mini's resolution not seem like as big of a deal as it was on the iPad 1/2.

Would I like to have a retina iPad mini? Hell yeah. In a heartbeat.
As long as they can keep the performance up, battery life up, screen quality good, weight low and heat low. That's a tall order, and that's why I think they skipped retina on the mini this time around.

1345303338.0	yfi1a	802.11n 5 GHz does not perform anywhere near 300 Mbps on the iPad. Here's why.	Sunday_is_race_day	48	3	19	"I started this post to ask why, when I'm using FileZilla to transfer files to my iPad 2 over 802.11n 5 GHz, I am only getting a 5.9 MBps transfer rate. I wound up answering my own question, so I wanted to post this summary to hopefully save others the effort.

[Example hype](http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Routers/RTN56U/) by my ASUS router that makes me excited for super-fast transfer speeds:

&gt;Double your wireless performance and bandwidth with simultaneous 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands speed up to 300Mbps concurrently

Now, my router can *push* those speeds, but its up to the device to be able to also *pull* those speeds. For example:

&gt;With 802.11n, the iPad only uses a single spatial stream and are not able to do channel bonding, limiting their link rate to a maximum of 65Mbps

-[Xirrus Networks](http://www.xirrus.com/cdn/pdf/Xirrus_SolutionBrief_TabletSmartphone.aspx)

[Wikipedia table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#Protocols) for 802.11 speeds.

Now I'm starting to understand my speed troubles.

&gt;Broadcom, has announced the new BCM4329 combination chip featuring 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth, and FM technologies all on a single die ... Broadcom states that their implementation of 802.11n in the new chip will boast ""up to 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) of actual wireless throughput""

-[HotHardware](http://hothardware.com/News/Broadcoms-Chip-brings-80211n-to-Mobile-Devices/)

&gt;BCM4329 - This is the radio chip that is being used in the iPod touch 3G, iPad, iPhone 4, iPod touch 4G, Apple TV 2G, and iPad 2.

-[TheiPhoneWiki.com](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=BCM4329)

Now I know *exactly* why I'm getting 5.9 MBps (47.2 Mbps).

For what it's worth,

&gt;The [iPhone] 4S uses BCM4330, Broadcom’s newest WLAN, Bluetooth, and FM combo chip

I have a 16gb iPad and this is the first time I've brought it anywhere without knowing that I will have a constant Internet connection.
I'm a freelancer in web design so going away without my normal set of tools (safari w. developer tools on, Transmit, BBEdit and terminal) is a little bit of a risk.


Preparation;
I've just discovered that 16 gb is extremely small. Luckily I'm bringing my iPhone too, so I deleted all music on my iPad. Instead I managed to get 23 episodes of a tv-series into it.
I also found out that my local library ""lends"" e-book that automatically deletes after 28 days. Getting them into my iPad wasn't very easy but I got 6 books in too. (if you have a Swedish library card and want to know how to get them into the iPad, just ask, i can write a guide).
**that was it** iPad full.


Day 1-4
Hostel in Istanbul - Internet is sloooooow. Decided to get a tabbed browser, usually safari works fine, but waiting for a page to load is boring. [iLunascape](http://www.lunascape.tv/iLunascape.aspx) is free and works good. I'm ready to pay for a better tabbed browser, but why apple don't have this built in is a mystery.

Day 5, first problem.
Letter from a client, something in a CMS (content management system) isn't working.
Realizes that htmlbox (popular open source JavaScript text editor) doesn't work on iPad. 
This is really bad, first thing I have to do when I come home is to try to make a mobile version of this implementation

Day 6 - Abu dhabi airport. 
The skype app is for iPhone, but why on earth don't iPhone app rotate?
Find another JavaScript error on the iPad. My online service for sending SMS don't alert success - so I'm manage to send the same ""I'm ok"" message home six or seven times - making everybody really nervous :)

Still, no real problem with customers, I have [FTP on the go](http://www.ftponthego.com/) and Ssh but im not really looking forward to using it in a ""live"" situation. 

Coming up, two days in Manila and then I'm going completely of the grid. If anyone is interested I can make a part two when I come back to wifi and report if the iPad hols up.

It's one thing to expect a customer to have a persistent connection when they're at home using a desktop and likely have some form of internet connection. It's a whole other kettle of fish to expect someone who's using a restricted data cap on an unreliable mobile connection to be 'always on'.

For myself, my three hour commute to work is almost entirely underground on the tube. Countless times I've downloaded a game (some for quite a bit of money) and sat down on the way to work then been told that I can't use it until I've got a connection. Cue extremely dull three hour journey.

I just bought Dark Meadow as it has been a while since I've played a good survival horror game and from what I read in reviews it sounded like it would be pretty immersive but the game just seems boring and the combat is more annoying than anything else. I head shot the first zombie or whatever it was several times and that wasn't enough to kill it?

It is also highly annoying that after each kill it brings up a victory screen tallying all the points you earned so it completely kills any atmosphere it had built up.

Why don't any of these games allow you to move around freely like classic Doom does? The games look graphically amazing yet they fall so far short on the actual game play.

Do people maybe enjoy earning/collecting all the in game items so they have the best sword etc? That is what both Infinity Blade and Dark Meadow seem to be designed around and it totally kills the gameplay for me.

It's annoying that companies think ipad users are cash cows.

***EDIT*** I forgot to mention E-books. The whole reason textbooks were expensive was the publishing cost but now e-books cost almost as much as the physical book and you can't even resell it back to get back some cost. I don't think they can justify server cost to replace publishing cost's either and I haven't heard of authors getting extremely wealthy off books.

Bought my iPad 3 over the week end, updated it to iOS 6 assuming the best, see my iPad battery life drain at steady rate with basic use (and even quite significantly while on standby). 

I turned to forums and I cannot downgrade it without having previously jailbroken it. So I'm shit out of luck until jailbreakers figure out how to do so and then downgrade from there.

I was also considering bringing it back to the retailer with the complaint that the battery was draining unusually fast and to ask for a replacement. Would this work?

If anyone has had similar problems and found some kind of solution I would be very happy to hear your suggestions. 

**Edit**
So here's what I did. I continued testing the ipad to make sure it wasn't me who was crazy, and in the end it was the ipad that seemed to have a defective battery. I brought it back to the shop and exchanged it for a new one (even upgraded to a 32gb model in the process). I'm going to pay close attention to its battery life, and hold off from updating to iOS6 despite not having any proof that it was the OS that caused the battery drain. 

Thanks /r/iPad , I think there's a good community here of helpful individuals. You guys/girls make Reddit the awesome place that it is.

Sicks3144	48	7	164	"There's only really one thing I firmly dislike about the iPad (well, iOS really) and that's the way it handles multitasking. I find it pretty infuriating to receive a notification from an app, switch to it and then wait for the app itself to catch up to what the push notification told me about. On my laptop, I can browse the web and chat on an instant messenger (for example) essentially simultaneously. On the iPad/iPhone, the experience is considerably more clunky. I realise this is a trade off - apps running ""properly"" in the background would eat battery and cause the foreground app to slow down, but that doesn't stop it spoiling the use of the device.

I built an experimental [Blue Light Therapy App for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blue-light-therapy/id537446731?mt=8). It lets me play with blue light to make me feel better. 

**How it works**: your eyes register blue light and trigger wake/sleep transition within the brain. In the winter, there's less blue light from the sky, because days are shorter and it's often cloudy.



**How to use**Set the iPad to show the app while you eat breakfast to tell your brain it's time to fully wake up.
-OR- Actively hold the device in your hand, and touch the screen with your finger to play with ripples of blue.



Surprisingly, it seems to work for me and has good reviews from the users.

**Dock**: Mail, Textfree iPad, Terra, Dropbox, iBooks, UPad.

* I use textfree because my phone was stolen and I'm on a dumbphone. T9 sucks. The iPad version doesn't have the voice calling like the iPhone version, but I have that as well in one of my folders.

* I like Terra as a browser because its free and it allows me to view webpages in compat mode as it would show up in say Firefox so I don't get redirected to the mobile site versions.
* Dropbox is a no brainer for syncing files between my computer and the iPad.
* iBooks: I love to read, and while iBooks isn't the best app to do it on it works for now.
* UPad: this is big because I import lecture notes and annotate my PDFs with them. Lots of people use iAnnotate, and I have yet to try it, but UPad works pretty well, it's been a bit buggy and crashy at times but they are always releasing bug fixes in the updates so it's pretty reasonable now, it also autosaves.


**Homepage**: Calengoo, Flipboard, Zite, Early Edition, Fluid, NPR, NYT, Nightstand, Weather+, Wunderlist, iPod, AirVideo, Pandora, Notes Plus, imo.im, Settings

* News Folder (USA Today, Al Jazeera, CNN, The Economist, Engadget, The Onion, NBC Nightly News)
* Social Folder (MyPad, Friendly, TalkaTone, Skype, Textfree for iPhone)
* iPad Folder (Youtube, Maps, Videos, Notes, Contacts, Photos, App store, Calculator Pro, Safari, Calendar, inClass, AppStart, iTunes, AppBoxPro, iSwifter- this is a shitty flash browser, I only purchased it because they donated the proceeds to Japan).


**Second Page**: iheartradio, flashcards, crackle, chase iPad, Wells Fargo, Notably, PageOnce, IMDB, Opera Mini, CHMate lite, Netflix.

* Sync folder: (Box.net, Sugarsync, Zumo drive) (these plus dropbox give me about another 12 GB of transfer for files and whatnot, plus AirPlay which means I don't have to store any videos locally if I didn't want to).
* Food and Shopping folder: (Yelp,  Epicurious, LocalEats, BigFork, Urbanspoon, Glit, Amazon.com, Groupon HD, eBay, Amazon windowshop, Living Social)
* Utilities folder: Free WiFi, PDF Reader, Dictation, Reeder, Bing for iPad, MW Dictionary, imgur free)

**Third Page**: games, the typical DeadSpace2, Towerdefense, etc etc

**Fourth Page**: Business Apps - Square, Invoice2goLite, PayPal, Quicksale Lite, Enterpreneur, Speed Test

* Remote Desktop Folder: (Splashtop, Teamviewer, GotoMyPC, VNC, 2xlient, liveview, displaylink - the last two make the iPad a third monitor for me)

**Fifth Page**: Med Apps - Medscape, QxCalculate, Drugs, Atoms, Molecules, Organs, FINR Brain, 3D Brain.



**Accessories**

* Boxwave stylus
* Neoprene case - I was at Fry's and they had one of [these](http://pic.en.518ad.com/PicFolder/En518adPic/Sell/20090323/5b53666c00ee4b2098e9f77b7a088a9b.jpg) and so I cut open the middle divider sewing and it fits my iPad2 perfectly! I put both in my camelback blowfish which I then take to school.
* Logitech/Zaggmate Keyboard Case (ordered)
* [Worth Insurance](http://m.worthavegroup.com/iphone_comparison_sm.jpg) for 3 years ($100)


I chose the white which is great for notes, horrible for movie viewing experiences, 16GB because I have a lot of cloud storage and the Air Video app streams everything from my server. I have an iPod touch so I don't use the iPad as a music player outside of my pandora. I chose wifi only because the data plans add up in terms of cost, and when I get a smartphone I'll save the money here and spend it on the data plans with tethering. Plus my campus has nearly full wireless-n coverage, the few times I would need Internet wouldn't justify the costs for me.

I do most things on the iPad but occasionally break out my old Windows laptop when I absolutely have to have a ""real"" computer.  Still, my iPad does the job for the most part.  I have to remote into my work PC from home a lot and GoToMyPC on the iPad works pretty well.  I also find it great for surfing the web, watching movie and playing games (which are the main things I do).

Sometimes it can be cumbersome or annoying to not use an actual PC or laptop; there are many web pages that I just can't use, and some YouTube videos are not available on iOS, but for the most part it can do anything I really care about doing.  I think that part of it for me is that I am just really fascinated by mobile computing, and I enjoy trying to push a small machine to its limits.  I went through graduate school using a netbook for everything (even writing research papers), and even managed to get it to play PC games that probably shouldn't have worked on it.  I like the challenge I guess.  I'm interested in the iPad Mini, but now that I'm spoiled to Retina screens it's going to have to be updated first.  I also would like to have an 11"" MBA eventually, but again I'm waiting on a Retina display.

Anyway, are there any others out there like me?  For me, the iPad isn't just something I break out for certain things... I use it for *everything*.  For the times when I don't have a WiFi connection or carrying the iPad isn't feasible, I just break out the iPhone."	t5_2rgny	True

1307827802.0	hxdlv	iOS 5 on an iPad 1 info for you		38	5	42	"I asked a couple days ago about installing iOS 5 on the iPad 1. I got some useful info, but no one seemed to just break down what works and what is broken, so here's a quick list of what you should expect and/or look out for based on a couple days of experience.

* Video streaming is largely broken. This effects HBO GO, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Air Video, and probably other stuff I don't have or don't use. YouTube works fine for me. **This is not Apple's fault, and it will not be ""fixed"" in the next beta.** I dunno why people don't understand that this is due to a change in the SDK, and will depend on Netflix, Hulu, et al, on releasing updated apps. Will they release updated versions live on the App Store that support iOS 5 beta? Don't know. I know some developers released updates for the 4.2 beta on the App Store. For right now if Netflix is important to you, do not install iOS 5 beta, there is no guarantee there will be a working Netflix any time before September.

* Some text fields in apps are completely broken. The recently released Wordi that was promoted on this subreddit, you can't even log in to get past the first screen. The OKCupid iPhone app is the same way, none of the text fields are selectable/work for the most part, couldn't log in or register. AlienBlue HD, when you go to submit a reply to someone by message, the text fields are automatically populated with some nonsense testing text, and parts of the AlienBlue UI are wonky, but otherwise work fine for browsing reddit. Any number of apps can be affected by this, which seems to stem from changes in the way the SDK handles UI, so your mileage may vary.

* ~~I personally cannot get the Mail app to display any sort of notifications, not on the lock screen or on the pull-down, though every other app seems to play nicely with the new pull-down system.~~ **UPDATE**: Thanks to *erillanos*: if you turn your iPad off and back on again after turning Mail notifications on, rebooting your iPad turns them on properly.

* Since I'm in the Twitter Pics beta or whatever, the Twitter integration and photo posting works great for me. Don't know if it'll work great for you. Non-pics beta people on Twitter just see absolutely nothing when trying to view pictures you upload using it, so don't bother using it regularly.

* Speed wise my iPad 1 performs on iOS 5 similarly to the way it did on 4.3, which is to say that it is kind of laggy sometimes. I would not say that it's decreased my speed any in normal app usage. New Safari and the new Music app lag worse than anything else. My buddy who still has his iPad on 4.2 has better performance than me still. He can play Infinity Blade, which I'm willing to bet still crashes on my iPad under iOS 5.

* No, you can't hide that Newsstand app anywhere.

* Swiping on the lockscreen to go to apps that have sent you notifications doesn't seem to work on the iPad.

* Dropbox integration is broken in iA Writer. This makes me think it's safe to assume Dropbox integration is broken in most apps.

* iPad 1 set up in developer mode does not seem to have access to ""multitasking gestures"" even though it used to in the 4.3 beta. iPad 2 does however. My searching and attempts haven't discovered any way to change this sad fact. Might be the one instance of feature-deprivation for an 'old' iPad.

If you have any other questions feel free to ask me. I have about 330+ apps so chances are I can test something for you if our app tastes align."	t5_2rgny	True

So I was hoping that there was something out there that could allow me to take control of her ipad from my PC while also showing her what to do when she wants to access the stuff she wants. 	t5_2rgny	True
