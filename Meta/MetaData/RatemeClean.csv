I am not striving to be stick thin, just to cut out some of the fat so I have a smoother figure.

6-1-8

First number is 1-9 on the persons face. 

Second number is a 0 (i would not hook up, date, what have you) or 1 (I WOULD hook up with, date, etc)

Third number is 1-9 on the persons body.

So if its only a face pic, then go 1-10. But if its whole body, please use the area code. You don't have to but man would rate me be better with it. 

edit: spelling

Edit 2: so the second number might be pointless but I mean I've seen some comments on here with ppl saying ""pretty but you look like a bitch/stuck up/mean"" or whatever so that could define a 0 or 1. Like a ""your hot but you look like you get around. 8-0-9""

Like I said its supposed to have 3 numbers so when your out in public you can be like ""4-1-9"" to your buddy and no one else would know your rating someone. But here I guess you can alter it how u want"	t5_2re84	True

The first digit, 1-9, rates a person's face (9=highest)

The middle digit, 0 or 1, indicates if you would bang (0=no)

The last digit, 1-9, rates a person's body.
 
e.g., ""He/she is pretty hot, I'd say a 718.""

Edit:
Wow thank you all for your responses, even the ones that were less than comlimentary (I asked for honesty and that's what I expected). A lot of you seem to think I shouldn't get the nose job... hopefully you mean that honestly and not just because you're against plastic surgery in general. But anyway, I am definitely reconsidering it at this point, thanks in part to most of you.

I guess... just... thoughts?  I don't know if there's a better subreddit for this to be on, or not.  Also, any suggestions?  Particularly, I'm trying to grow my hair back out but I've gotten mixed opinions on that.  Would you say I should keep it short/cut it shorter or let it grow back out?  Also, I'm trying to lose a few pounds (like 6-10), but some of my friends are telling me that I'll look bad if I do... am I really seeing myself wrong?  I don't think I'm pushing unhealthily skinny or anything.

EDIT 1: So... [this](http://i.imgur.com/il7A6re.jpg) is a really shitty selca, but it's more like my ""usual"" eye makeup, for those of you sharing opinions.  I actually don't have anything but a little concealer on, in this one... pretty sure it's just my camera that made my freckles basically disappear (not complaining).

EDIT 2: I guess I just wanted to say thanks to everybody that replied.  Between this and the crosspost over on amiugly, I think I got some really great advice on makeup (i. e. tone it down) and I feel like I can comfortably say I probably have a decent idea of where I stand... at least I'm not grossly over/under estimating myself."	t5_2re84	True

I haven't really been focusing too much on my appearance the past couple of months and I'm worried if that has something to do with my ex losing interest. I used to feel pretty but I kind of stopped caring and it shows, I'm doing some nice things for myself in the next couple days (hair done, spa day, etc) to make me feel a little bit better.

Anyways, sorry for the monologue. Heres a picture of me looking mighty glamorous, this is a senior picture so I definitely don't look this done up every day: http://imgur.com/4GJTS

Me with darker hair than normal (sorry for the poor quality): http://imgur.com/Sfxz0

No makeup, just took this. My hair is straightened so I look a little nicer than usual: http://imgur.com/gTviF

And a not-so-good picture of me. I really dislike this one but it's probably what I looked like rolling out of bed everyday to go to class, I want an honest rating so I'm adding this because my appearance can really vary according to how much effort I put in: http://imgur.com/RLncx

BE. HONEST. (Please and thank-you!)

A little bit about me, if you care to read:
As the title says, I'm a 20 year old female (21 in November!) who is just starting to figure out who I really am in life. I have never really had a lot of confidence, but I think I'm finally starting to figure that out too! Lately I've started working out, and trying to adapt to a more healthy lifestyle. My passion in life is working with horses. I ride mostly western, but will be getting back into English riding lessons to be a jumper. Other than horses, I enjoy photography, reading, writing, drawing, playing guitar, and pretty much anything that involves being in the great outdoors. I rarely wear makeup, and when I do, it's usually only a bit of mascara. :D Feel free to ask me anything else!

I would love any advice you guys have for me. I am aware that I need to lose a few pounds, and I think I'm doing great so far where weight is concerned! (Down about 10 lbs, go me!)
