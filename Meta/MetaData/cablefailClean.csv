The company's new guy, and only the new guy, is dispatched to do the grunt work of pulling the wires, installing boxes, doing the hanging conduit box drops, etc. he's finishing the last cable pull when his supervisor drops in to check on his progress. Initially he supervisor was impressed that all the lines have been run, everything neatly bundled, looking professional and ready to be terminated. 

Then he takes a closer look and sees that not a single cable has been labeled. Literally hundreds of cables need to be toned out, labeled, and terminated. 

The new guy was never seen again. I spent the next three days listening to the supervisor muttering curses and frustration as he worked to get things done right while I got servers, phone system, switches, etc. online and ready.
