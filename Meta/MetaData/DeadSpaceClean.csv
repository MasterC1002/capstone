1361845519.0	198ego	I don't know if anyone has figured this out yet (WARNING: FUll of Dead Space 2 &amp; 3 spoilers)	Krogane	187	16	31	"In Dead Space 2 Stross asks Isaac to follow the four steps: ""Crawl Inside the Machine, the Screws go tight all around, cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye"" Of course you all know what happens in DS2, but in Dead Space 3 they follow these exact same steps. 

Step 1-Crawl Inside the machine: In DS3 they fix the machine, and go inside 

Step 2-The Screws go tight all around: This one I still can't figure out, I may be wrong but I think its referring to when you put the codex in the machine.

Step 3-Cross my heart hope and hope to die: This is when Isaac say's goodbye to Ellie, because Isaac hopes he will die trying.

Step 4-Stick a needle in your eye: This is for the final boss when you are shooting the markers in to the its eyes.

I could be far off, or spot on. I just figured this out. Has anyone else posted a fan theory like this already? What do you guys think? "	t5_2r5qf	True

1360014733.0	17w35d	Welcome New Survivors ! An intro and a few key rules for the upcoming release (Please Upvote for visibility).	nicolauz	114	9	16	"Hello All !

Your friendly Moderator nicolauz here. Welcome to the Dead Space Reddit Community ! We've gotten quite a few new members in the past few weeks (actually about 800 in January alone !). Just wanted to go over a few ground rules for the release of the long awaited Dead Space 3. 

* **Discussion:**We highly encourage discussion and differing opinions are a great thing, please respect others for having their own as well. Basic reddiquette is expected here, so please no personal attacks ! :) Reddiquette can be found: [**here**](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette)


* **Let's Play video's:** We understand that a large swath of people enjoy doing their own ""Let's Play"" or Video Blog videos and show people themselves getting scared playing DS. We also realize that they get posted here very often, and are usually not well received so we've decided to limit these video's being posted to a weekly/when needed Moderator self post. Other then these posts they will be removed immediately.

* **Co-op Partners**: One of the mod's will also do a weekly (Monday) post if you're interested in finding a co-op partner in the sub here. (unless I can get text/image flair to work).

* **SPOILER POLICY**: This is a big one. It's understandable for you to get excited about a certain thing you found in game, or some CRAZY revelation you found out in DS3 but just remember *not everyone has played the game yet*. So using spoiler tags is essential to not bugging everyone else out. How to use spoilers are on the sidebar over there -----&gt;

* **Questions**: If you have specific questions, comments or suggestions for the sub, feel free to message any of us or just /r/deadspace. If you have general questions about the games themselves, enemies or weapons please refer to the Dead Space wiki: [found here](http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)

All of these rules are on the sidebar as well. Most of all have fun, be respectful and enjoy the company !"	t5_2r5qf	True

an engine went out? security can't deal with it, going to have to find an engi.

need heavy weapons as an engi? only the security team have passes for the barracks.

this would create some very interesting situations, with players trying to repair the ship, some trying to escape at all costs and others just going insane and seeing their team-mates as necros

Mycareer	67	3	15	"I work for Best Buy and every year they have a Holiday Kickoff event and most of the season's upcoming games are there. Other than Halo 4, Dead Space 3 was one of the first that i wanted to try out. The level i played was a level that i hadn't seen demoed before at E3 or any of the other conventions that it's been displayed at. The level started off with Isaac in normal clothes on a ship that was falling apart and you had to make your way to the Environment suit and once you did you get sucked out the window into space and have another moment similar to DS2 where you have to avoid the space debris while making your way to another ship. It was just as intense as that moment in two, and it was just as awesome. Once on the ship, you had various tasks to complete that showed off the various features of the game. The lighting in this other ship was TERRIFYING. There were moments when you couldn't see a thing when you weren't aiming with your plasma cutter/light. There was a zero-g environment with a couple lurkers and what looked like an abandoned theater with some slashers. I was hoping for some kind of creepy movie to show up at this point, but nothing happened. It wasn't a complete build as i did encounter some errors, and none of the text/audio logs were in game, so i'm hoping something will be added here later. At the very end was a puzzle to solve with kinesis and a new enemy type showed up here. Looks like a large man carrying an axe, and if you shoot his upper torso off, he sprouts tentacles. Was a pretty awesome new enemy.

All in all, this was VERY MUCH Dead Space, and absolutely reinforced in my mind that the whole game isn't gonna be like the ice planet, so i'm not worried with the direction that game is going...Feb. 5th can't get here fast enough!"	t5_2r5qf	True

(Possible spoilers)	RepublicofTim	54	8	33	"It makes sense that the series would make that change, story-wise. The first game is the scariness because of the unpreparedness and strangeness of it. In the first game, Isaac is an engineer, a mechanic, he has had no military or fighting training so far as we know. So to be thrust into this life or death situation with alien zombies trying to kill you when you aren't a skilled soldier can be pretty scary. 

In Dead Space 2, Isaac has gotten much better at killing necromorphs, so the scary doesn't come from them but it comes from Isaac's insanity caused by the marker. His constant and frightening hallucinations of Nicole add a jump scare sort of scary into Dead Space 2, its still scary in parts but not as much as the first.

In Dead Space 3, Isaac is a seasoned necromorph killer. He's killed so many necromorphs that they aren't even scary anymore, they're just an obstacle in his way. And after he got rid of his dementia, there's not really that much holding him back anymore.

TL;DR: Isaac's necromorph fighting skill got much better over the three games, making them progressively less scary."	t5_2r5qf	True

1364614284.0	1ba95p	A couple interesting things from the Dead Space Art and UI talks at GDC today	sigfemseks	49	7	12	"I went to two GDC talks about Dead Space this morning, and I thought you guys might appreciate some of the little things I learned. Unfortunately, there's not really any story/lore related stuff, but here it is anyway:

- The Objective tracker line that Isaac projects onto the ground was a last minute addition to the first game, when play tests showed that the in-game map was largely useless and too hard to navigate. The last minute addition ended up being one of the more iconic UI elements in the series.

- Dead Space 2 originally had a vending machine that you could stick your arm in, and it would draw your blood/deplete health in exchange for credits. If you left your arm in for too long, you would die. The machine had a cartoony vampire bat on the side of it.

- Another cut aspect from Dead Space 2 was the ability to hack ATMs for credits.

- The pop up UI system (inventory, videos) is made up entirely of particle effects. Yes. They said it was a huge pain in the ass to create even the simplest things, such as the UI on a door panel.

- Dead Space 2 initially included 3 different types of nodes, that would eventually end up being the salvage materials system in Dead Space 3.

- The background of Dead Space 1's main menu was set to include some very graphic and intense scenes of a person transforming into a Necromorph, but due to budget issues, the UI team instead went to a butcher shop with around $500 and bought loads of animal parts. In the garage of a team member, they filmed themselves disemboweling these carcasses and breaking bones and things. A couple of filters later, we ended up with the current main menu backgrounds. Go check it out.

- Someone asked about the visor light being projected into the environment, and as many people have already explained, the Art Director stated that it only turns on in very dark areas and it's working as intended.

- Much of the UI talk was about how they strived to make the UI diagetic, meaning, the UI is not only for the player, but for Isaac as well. This was a huge point they made, and the speaker was very sad that they couldn't make the crafting in DS3 work in a way that included Isaac in the frame physically putting the weapon together, but they did try. They went through many, many, many iterations before finally realizing it wasn't possible to have him be in the frame while also having an easy to use crafting system.

That's what I can remember off the top of my head. I'll ask my co-worker who was there with me if he can think of any that I missed. I'll edit this post if that's the case. Also, I apologize if any of these things are common knowledge."	t5_2r5qf	True

Companies NEED to draw in a bigger crowd. Dead Space 1 didn't sell amazingly well, so they made the marketing more action oriented. Like it or not, these companies need to make money, and are more interested in that than anything (Dead Space 2's launch trailer had SMASHING PUMPKINS playing over it for god's sake). They NEED to show something new and exciting at E3 for the crowd. 

They expect the fans to expect that the series will already have the trademark dark corridors and distant noises (they have stated as such in magazine articles), but I think they didn't expect fans to label the whole game as a shooter. But I'm just having trouble understanding a lot of the complaints.

* ""Co-op isn't scary"" - Then don't play co-op? The previews have stated that single player is the main focus. If you don't wanna play co-op, there also won't be an AI present, Isaac will be by himself, and the way the game plays out will be different to adjust for this. The executive producer said the story will play out exactly the same, but certain scenes will be altered depending on whenether John Carver is present. 

* ""People are shooting at you now"" - How do we know this comprises the whole game? How do we know they can't make this fit into the horror atmosphere? I see people's concern here the most, but I think we should see a bit for ourselves what they do with it. 

* ""The ice planet isn't scary"" - Once again, why are we not waiting to see what they do with it? I mean, just check out this new enemy and the environment it's in : http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Feeder (not to mention, read how they're formed. Pretty fucked up). That looks pretty Dead Spac-ey to me. I could be wrong, but I have no clue, because I haven't played it. 

I think the only reason it aggravates me is that so many people are on their high horse saying they won't buy it, but we all know EVERYONE will. Then everyone will talk about how EA is a bunch of guys in offices wearing tuxedoes with cigars in their mouths going ""Mua-ha-ha"". Then the process will repeat with another game.

Just wanted to vent my frustration. I understand everyone's frustration, but seriously guys. *The game was just freaking announced.*

A lot of people seem pissed that DS3 isn't going to be more of the same stuff as DS1 and DS2. Oddly enough, I'm in the other camp, which seems to be quite small. I don't want more of the same. Now, three games later, I'm _ready_ to suit up and give those necromorphs and Unitologist bastards what's coming for them.

I'm _ready_ to grab some guns, a buddy, and go all Rambo on those bastards. After two full games of feeling mostly powerless and earning every single piece of ammo and every new scrap of upgrade, I'm _ready_ to shove my boot up some necro ass.

It's about frickin' time.

My only real complaint from what I've seen so far is the over-the-top and excessive swearing from the main characters. I dunno, maybe it makes sense given their mental state and all, but it just seems a bit too much.

Not really a point to this edit, other than to say that Visceral clearly employs some really stand up people, and those forum warriors who write off every EA game at this point because ""GRR MASS EFFECT"" need to take a serious look at themselves and decide whether they actually care about good games, or just like to shit on everything popular. 

And no, I am not employed by nor give a shit about EA as a publisher, I'm just sick of the internet being the internet and crusading against good things because they couldn't handle disappointment once in their miserable lives.[/soapbox]

-----

I should first point out that I beat DS1 15-ish times, and DS2 about 10. Dead Space 2 is unequivocally my favorite game of all time, and while I realize that makes a huge segment of the serious gaming population hate me for implying that a game less than 10 or 15 years old is the best, I stand by my claim.

I beat DS3 on Normal in just over 12 hours, with somewhere around 20 deaths total, if I had to guess. 

It was a great experience.

It was not as good as Dead Space 2.

I'll answer any gameplay-related questions, and any minor spoilers (e.g. ""How was this boss battle?"" or ""Is this story thread resolved (yes/no)?"") with spoiler tags. If you want real in depth plot related details, I'd be happy to PM anyone specifics.

[Save is grayed out due to New Game+iness](http://i.imgur.com/JYPzfVc)

**EDIT:** Protip: always have a Torque Bar with you. If you played DS2 you know the utility of keeping one power node at all times, and the Bars are the DS3 equivalent. Early on they seem really expensive, but the upgrades you get out of the locked rooms are universally worth much more than the bar alone, and you frequently even get the raw materials back as well.

**EDIT EDIT:** I've gotten a few questions about suits in the game, and now that I'm more than halfway through NG+ on hard, I have a few answers. The main game has five suits, all unlocked automatically throughout the game for free, with only cosmetic differences. Upon completing the game (on normal, at least) you unlock one more suit from a past game. However, unlike Dead Space 2, on a new playthrough the original five suits **do not** have special ""Elite"" versions. So, unless something changes near the end, it seems like there are only six suits for the second playthrough. There may be unlockable suits for beating Hard/Impossible; I do not know at this point. The description for beating Classic, however, implies that you get some sort of new suit/helmet of some sort, so there's that, at least.

Overall, seems like a minimum of six or seven suits in the base game, with potential to unlock one or two more that I'm not aware of yet. This is of course NOT including any DLC/pre-order exclusive suits.

**EDIT EDIT EDIT:** I said ""screw it"" and went online. [Further verification.](http://www.trueachievements.com/Unixsystem13.htm)

1362928868.0	1a0xmr	" ""Help me terminator, kill all of the necromorphs!"""	CaptThack	43	3	39	"An earlier post on this Reddit got me wondering.

The resource bots in dead space don't get attacked by necromorphs. At all. Despite the fact that they are constantly making notice and even shine light on feeders if deployed by them. This leads to the implication that necromorphs only kill to support convergence, they NEED organic tissue and organic tissue only.

So why don't humans just use robots to fight the necromorphs? I'm mainly talking about Tideman in dead space 2(the ONLY group of people who new about necromorphs BEFORE suffering an outbreak). They should already be using robots for mining. The advantages are overwhelming:

- No need for constant time spent in the vacuum of space or planets like Tau Volantis, where the environment is hard on humans.
- No Feeders or are least less of them! More rations for the robot managers!
- A better method for deep space explorations (robots don't need to be put in stasis to pass time while traveling in deep space).
- A faster and more detailed report about what happens during a necromorph outbreak as robots will be ignored. Therefore supporting any attempts to regain control of an outbreak.
- Robots can be programmed to only attack dead tissue that has been reanimated(robot sees dead person moving? RIP HIS ARMS OFF!)
- Did I say less feeders?

And yes, this is my first post. "	t5_2r5qf	True

This weapon seriously is so ridiculously overpowered, we have both tried to find some other powerful weapon combinations so we could get some variation but nothing even comes close to it.

I tried using a shotgun with +6 damage at point blank range on casual and it still took 2-3 shots to kill it.

This weapon on the other hand 1-2 shots EVERYTHING (multiple necromorphs too if they're in a line) on ""Impossible"" difficulty, works at immense ranges and fires really quickly. Hell, I don't even have to hit them and it still rips limps off.

We've waltzed through the game (only chapter 10 but still) so far, it barely uses any ammo, we never get hit and we never have to use statis so we're swimming in resources and just wasting them willy-nilly. I tried equipping 3 -1 damage circuits on it, still just as effective.

1360497278.0	188sab	Weapon Crafting Info	ManaLeek	36	2	13	"This post is for weapon crafting tips you may have for other people. I guess I'll kick it off.


1. Relatively sure weapons don't ""max out"" when the gauges are full. Tested using a chain gun with lots of +clip chips and attachments, and was able to get up to a 281 clip size. Fairly sure this also applies to +damage, and +reload as well. Will touch on +rate of fire farther below.


2. Your weapon reload speed is based off of your upper weapon, so it's usually better to put something like a rocket launcher as your lower attachment. Also, in the same vein, any +reload bonuses apply to your whole gun regardless of where it is placed (this is slightly obvious, but I will admit that I overlooked this initially).


3. When increasing rate of fire for semi-automatic guns, keep in mind that (for some guns) you'll eventually be capped by how quickly you can click.


4. Scavenger bots will still give you resources regardless of where you release them. You can even release them when it shows no resource nodes nearby, and you'll still get something (even works in the weapon crafting arena). You will probably get more resources in all if you just keep using them whenever you can, compared to waiting for those nodes.


5. MK-V parts are currently the best attachments and modules you can get. Also has the best (non-preorder/non-dlc) weapon tips. The weapon tips give +rate of fire, and attachments give you +clip (they can be fairly relevant, especially for the low-clip guns, like the javelin gun). The module bonuses vary.


6. The 'best' frames in the game are the Compact Earth Gov Frame (+rate of fire), and the Heavy SCAF Frame (+damage). Each starts with 2/2 circuit slots, but they can easily be upgraded to 4/4 (and this only has to be done once). Additionally, the only way to craft more of these frames, is by creating a blueprint of a weapon that uses them, and then crafting it."	t5_2r5qf	True
1359240916.0	17c6yh	Evolution of Dead Space	lonely_odst	37	0	19	"Ok, so I know people aren't happy that the horror aspect of the game diminished over the course of the game series, but I personally love it. Don't get me wrong, I played hours of Dead Space 1 and 2, and loved the horror part, it was what attracted me to the series in the first place. But I think the gradual lessening of horror makes complete sense both canonically and realistically. 

In the first game, you're a scared, innocent engineer who doesn't know whats happening. Your squad has just been massacred and you're running for your life, and the marker is screwing with your head as your girlfriend. In DS2, you're a changed man. You've seen this before. And you know how to stop it. So you're naturally less scared. In DS3, you're on the run, determined to survive. People are hunting you now, not just monsters. 

So its just a natural progression of the story i suppose.

Realistically, EA and Visceral have to appeal to a larger audience, and so perhaps some of the true horror was taken out to appeal to a wider audience.

1362972159.0	1a27ug	Norton's Character	ForTheWilliams	35	3	12	"(Forgive the wall of text.)

I wanted to talk a bit about Norton's character. 

I feel a bit more willing to give him the benefit of the doubt than a lot of other people seem to he, and I don't think he is quite the man-child dolt of a bad-guy that we like to joke about. 

In fact, I actually really liked him early on. His no-nonsense attitude was actually pretty entertaining and even helpful, he seemed to be fairly competent in his role (though perhaps a bit brash, as evidenced by his boyish enthusiasm when the Eudora swoops in for the rescue early on), and he didn't seem one to turn down good ideas, even if he wasn't the one to come up with them (early on, at least). I did lose respect for him as things went on, but I also think that his behavior could have been a bit of a tragic fall, not just Norton being an ass.

-----------

He definitely has some character flaws, but I think that, given what he goes through, he reacts in the same ways I think a lot of people I'd like to call good easily could have. 

Not only was Ellie showing a distressing amount of attachment and concern for Isaac (even shaking Norton's hand off her shoulder when she sees Isaac for the first time), and not only is the situation going from bad to extremely desperate as they go on, but Isaac has taken charge and shown considerable competence at coming up with solutions to big problems that left Norton in the proverbial dust. Isaac saves everyone's lives at least once or twice before they even get a shuttle, and Norton is probably feeling a bit overshadowed as a result. This further amplifies the issues with Ellie, as it is her *ex* who is showing him up.

In the end, Norton's relationship with Ellie seems to be threatened, his self-esteem and self-worth are threatened, and his very *existence* is being threatened. Bombarded not only by ego-threats but threats to his and his crews very lives, he breaks down and just wants to get away from every one of those threats. From the planet, from the Necromorphs, and finally, from Isaac. 

--------------

His skepticism about the team's plans and ability to carry them out wasn't exactly irrational either. They *were* facing terrible odds. Even just getting down to the planet to begin with was not only extremely risky, it was extremely costly: two of Norton's crew are killed before they even reached the surface. 

Once they got there, the plan was to somehow find and attempt to use a mysterious alien device, the purpose, function, or origin of which they didn't even have a passing understanding of. In fact, [had they actually succeeded in doing what they'd *initially* set out to do, they would have doomed the entire human race](/spoiler ""DS3""). The risks and degree of uncertainty associated with what they were trying to do were both huge. Moreover, the only evidence the had to go on was some scrawls on a wall and Isaac's touched-in-the-head-edness, both of which could be rightly viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism. Ultimately, the team is able to pull it off, but given the unknowns beforehand, and the fact that they had to get extremely lucky a number of times for that to happen, coming to the conclusion that they were on a wild goose chase that had no hope of success is not an obviously inaccurate deduction.

----------------

He certainly doesn't make the *right* calls later on, but he makes more forgivable, or at least understandable ones than we might be giving him credit for. He certainly doesn't go out well, but by that point he had so many weights bearing down on him that I could appreciate even a person I knew and respected more than Norton could react much the same way.

----------

On an somewhat related note, I was actually a bit disappointed that [Norton was the one who sent the signal to Danik. He was an obvious suspect, but I was sort-of hoping, and even expecting, that it was actually going to be Santos. She was *astoundingly* chipper given the circumstances (before the lift scenes at least), and she was also perhaps a *bit* too enthusiastic about delving into the frozen Nexus experiment; I was seriously expecting her to be a committed Unitologist who was, once again, using Isaac to do their work (re-awakening the Nexus, getting information about the machine for Danik's purposes, or some other purpose). That would have had its own shares of distasteful problems, as betrayals almost always seem to have, but at least it wouldn't have been from the source that everyone should have been immediately suspicious of.](/spoiler ""DS3"")

• Respect every aspect of stasis:

Veterans of Dead Space understand me when I say that stasis has been nerfed. And its been nerfed HARD. But this does not mean u can ignore it and have a easy time through the game. ALL necromorphs except for Exploders(yellow arms) and Lurkers(three tentacle heads) immediately charge you in this game. Having an unlimited means of slowing them down is invaluable. You can increase the effect by using it more than once on the same enemies aka ""stacking"" it. This gives it the same power and slowness as earlier Dead space games. On a more advanced note ALWAYS shoot it at a necros feet instead of its body. This helps with the splash effect it has and prevents missing altogether. Respect your stasis and win the game.

• Almost all of the ""tools"" have been nerfed in favor of the ""weapons"":

Obviously an effect of EA's producers (it seems an attempt to coddle newer players). This is most noticeable with the Plasma Cutter and Line Gun. The PC even sounds less lethal than previous games. This being said it still pays off to dismember enemies instead of just shooting them and the tools make that much easier. So do not rely on ammo eating military engines if you are new and get a feel for how Dead Space is played.

• Rely less on shooting necromorphs with their own limbs: 

The act of shooting dismembered limbs is a great way to save ammo, but due to the fact that all necros charge you now it is much, much, much more risky. Using stasis first is strongly advised but not necessary for better players. I remember in DS2 I was able to shoot off limbs and catch them in midair to shoot before necromorphs could even recover from flinching off of the first shot. Sadly, this is much more difficult even early in the game with a strong Planet Cracker.

• IMMEDIATELY make a blueprint for the planet cracker!!! 

For some reason in my game if I remove the rotator from the Planet Cracker I cannot put another one on it. So just make a blue print of it if you mean to experiment. Oddly this does not happen with other free guns like the Negotiator. 

• Scavanger bots runs are always worth it: 

Never neglect your scav bots. They gather plenty of tungsten(the hardest material to find in the game) and bring you the very important ration seals for free DLC items. Better players might become jaded with them or shun the micro transactions, but they are a great means to get overclocked parts early. You are going to get them anyway.

• If u pan on dodge rolling. Make it a habit and master it: 

In DS3 you do not flinch when hit by lighter attacks while rolling, but you still take damage. This means that DRing will still get you out of a tight spot but will come at a price. This also means that you MUST decide on it early or you will take damage. That being said rolling is something that Dead Space has always needed due to the fact that u do not begin running at full speed. Timing is key. 

• Make weapons that compliment the alt fire and vice versa: 

I believe this was implied in DS2 by Visceral with the new Force Gun alt fire. A good example is using the Ripper to give the Contact Bean safer charging time while it floats in front of you. Be smart and creative. 

• Lastly, do not forget long range weapons: 

Since the nerfing of stasis and weapons like the Line Gun have come it is almost imperative that you have a weapon that shoots fast rounds. For clarity I mean a gun that has bullets that travel quickly through the air and shoot immediately after pulling the trigger. This rules out guns like the Ripper alt fire, Bolas weapons, and Line Gun. The reason is that certain bosses require you to shoot soft spots while constantly moving, making slow shooting guns easily dodgeable. Do not let the telemetry spike fool you. They are slow!

And that's it! Feel free to give advice in the comments."	t5_2r5qf	True

I recently put together an android app which changes the background wallpaper to indicate the battery percentage using Isaac's rig as an indicator. In particular the air tank displays an exact battery percentage while the health bar indicate a general range.
While I am not intending to do a full scale release I thought there might be some members of this subreddit which would enjoy it, so without further adieu.

The .apk can be found at any of the following sources:

There are multiple versions contained in the zip I have linked, you can either use the specific version which corresponds to the DPI of your phone which should work on nearly every phone so long as you choose the right DPI or you can try the 'fitres' version which will attempt to read your screen DPI and scale the wallpaper as needed though it is fairly buggy in this regard.

here is a image showing the app in action on a virtual machine: http://i.imgur.com/HiN4Ks9.png

I think I was around 18 or 19 at the time, and I was with my cousins, 17 and 15. My 15 year old cousin wanted to try Dead Space (the first one) so he rents it and that night we all sit in the dark living room and watch him pop it in and play. He wanted the best experience, so we shut the lights off in the house and sit in the dark with only the glow of the television. Now, me and the second oldest cousin, we're giant wusses and we want the lights on, but the youngest insists on playing with the lights off, so we oblige.

I forget how far into the game we get, but I remember that Isaac gets onto an elevator. As the elevator starts moving, a necromorph climbs up from below the elevator. Cue the scream. But not from me or the second oldest cousin. Yup, the young one. He quit playing after that and we all went to bed, all the while the second oldest cousin and I nearly pissed ourselves laughing."	t5_2r5qf	True

Reading reviews that didn't sound promising. From actual reviewers to gamers. I heard a mix of both bad and good. But I couldn't pass on my favorite game series. I picked it up early Friday and pooped it in. Playing non stop till just now. A good 17 hours of exploring and amazement the whole way through. I was terrified it wouldn't be classic dead space, But fuck yes it was. The weapon crafting felt like an amazing attribute to the game. Like other people have stated, it does make you feel like an actual engineer. Crafting your own weapon and watching it rape necros gives you a warm gidy feeling inside. Like you actually developed a weapon of mass destruction. I was also terrified of the game not being as scary as the the others. I don't know whether I'm a pussy or just WAY to into the game, but I definitely shit my pants quite a couple of times. Literally the same as the others. The story, Oh the story. It was absolutetly one of the best in the series. The relationship between Issac and Ellie. The story behind Tau Volantis. (Which I must say without spoiling anything. Reading the logs about Tau Volantis made me shiver.) This was literally one of the ONLY games where I have dropped my mouth during a cut-scene. The voice acting was phenomenal, the animations were perfect. I can't express how happy I am with this installment. I went in doubting, and left a true believer. Believing that this is definitely one of the best game and game series I have ever played. If you haven't picked up this game yet, either because of the same reasons I was questioning on doing so or because just haven't gotten around to it. You NEED to! Especially if you are a giant fan of the series like I am. Now I'm off to complete it on Classic mode. Then off to find a co-op body do play it through with.

1360108078.0	17yqoo	Dead Space 3 Weapon Discussion	Jusicarchon	28	3	51	"Let's talk weapons! With more options than ever and some serious investment required for certain choices, we should share our thoughts on our choices and how well they do/don't work. 

I'm on Chapter 7 so far. I'm really digging the customization but many of the weapons, but with so many choices there are quite a few redundancies. Here are my thoughts so far:

- Force gun: With rivet shotguns and military shotguns being early options, this weapon feels greatly outclassed. It just felt like an extremely underpowered shotgun. I haven't tried to ""knockback"" tip yet.

- Carbine: One of the first weapons you can put on your heavy frame by dismantling your pistol. Unfortunately its semi-auto so it just feels like a weaker version of the plasma cutter with a larger clip.

- Plasma Cutter: Like in the previous 2 games this gun remains an all-around winner. The planet cracker or ""wider line"" tips seem to be the best, with planet cracker holding a small advantage. With planet cracker it really feels like a beast gun. 

- Rivet gun: Another weak semi-auto option that's outclassed by the plasma cutter.

- Shotgun (military): For those claustrophobic rooms/corridors , nothing makes me feel safer than having my shotgun at the ready. It has a significant stagger effect and can blown away necros in ~2 hits. Even if you miss a limb it will do great damage and the stagger will give you some room to breath. 

- Line Gun: Still a great choice, but it feels like it lacks the ""oomph"" its predecessors had. If you kept upgrading your line gun in previous games it felt like it was guaranteed to shred limbs whereas even starter necros can withstand a shot to the legs sometimes without losing them. Still the width of the shot makes it a good choice against most of the threats you'll be facing early on and you can produce one almost as soon as weapon customization becomes available. 

- Revolver: Trying this one now but it really feels like another planet cracker plasma cutter but without the wide shots. That's not a bad thing but why not use another plasma cutter? 

There are still some options available to me now that I still haven't tried (Line gun tips that make it shoot bolas or chain lightning, javelin, assault rifle, arc welder) but I hope others might offer their insights on these. It's also only about 30% through the game so I'm sure there are still tons of weapons that will come later for people to discuss.

My parting thoughts are that you should always keep 1 tungsten torque bar on you at all times (once you start getting tungsten) and that the ""stasis coating"" attachment REALLY IS as good as it sounds. Some of your shots will slow down enemies for just a fraction of a second, but in Dead Space those fractions count. "	t5_2r5qf	True

1361805732.0	1970vz	My thoughts on the scare factor of the Dead Space games POSSIBLE SPOILERS INSIDE		36	12	16	"I think we can all agree that Dead Space 3 was the least scary of the games. I have been thinking for awhile why this is ture (in opinion). I finally came to this conclusion.

**Dead Space**

Dead Space 1 is about an Engineer trying to find his lady friend. Everything goes horribly wrong and as the player you are shitting yourself. Why? The answer is because you have no idea what is going around you. As the player you know **NOTHING** about the events happeneing around you. By the end of the game you still don't know shit other than a giant red rock created by man makes people into killing machines and it's scary. Then you think you die.

**Dead Space 2**

You wake up in an unfmaliar place and have to run for your life. At the very start of the game you are dumped into having no idea what is going on, leaving you scared. Throughout the game you are trying to figure everything out while you are going insane (just like how youwere going insane in DS1). By the end of the game you understand that Markers cause convergence, but you have no idea why and you end the game pissing yourself. 

**Dead Space 3**

The whole point of the 3rd game was to conclude on any question and that is the exact reason as to why it is less scary. From the beggening we know what Necromorphs are; we know what the Marker does to people. We know about the different types of Markers and where the Red ones come from. The only questions left is how to stop them. **The whole game is based around understand something we did not understand in the first two games.** 


**My point TL;DR**

Dead Space and Dead Space 2 were scarier than Dead Space 3 becauce in the first two games we were playing with things we didn't understand. Dead Space 3 was about understanding everything and once we knew all the details it wasn't as scary because we knew. **We fear what we don't understand.**

I am totally over thinking this because it is a video game but JAVA class is a joke.

Anyways when you get into that room with all the dead bodies that are wrapped up, if you go over to the wall that is straight ahead when you walk in, you see a body wearing clothing similar to what Nicole is wearing and has the face completely wrapped up. From what I remember this is the only corpse with a completely wrapped up face. The rest are all exposed. 

Made me wonder if it could be her. 
Since I don't have time to go back and look for it, maybe someone else will.

Hey there, yeah I had a promo offer to get some used games from GameStop, I got Dead Space 1 and 2. I know, I'm kinda late.

Whatever. Anyway, I've got some questions about some of the characters:

1) My fake dead girlfriend, Nicole. Did Isaac really never watch that whole video message, or was it just a mental block? And is that her that gave me ANOTHER mini heart attack in that final cut-scene?

2) Unitology Indian guy. Was he the one that was blocking Hammond's RIG, or was it Kendra? And why did he always stay away from the necromorphs, even though he thought they were divine or something? Was he really THAT bent on killing me?

3) Hitler. Was he crazy or not? Was the Marker fucking with him too?

4) Kendra. I couldn't really understand what she was saying in the end other than about Nicole. What did she want with the Marker? 

5) Was the Marker destroyed when the asteroid hit the planet? 

That's about it. Some answers would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: By Hitler I meant the German sounding guy with the slicked black hair that Kendra killed towards the end when she stole the shuttle. "	t5_2r5qf	True

There is just that bond there, Having it by your side during the first chain of events on the Ishimura, Then again whilst on Titan Station.. It's only right that it has it's place in the third one also. Below you will find the links for well.. It's just a harbinger of death in my opinion, Two shotting most normal Necros and taking down the larger ones in just a few more. 

Initial Fitting:

Circuits:
http://i.imgur.com/j02G3XN.jpg

The MK-V Attachments took a fairly long time to find, the majority of them being via Ration Seal packs and for those wondering what difference the Mk-V Rotator module has, It increases reload speed even more so :)

The circuits are comprised of 2 '+3 Damage +3 Rate of Fire' and 2 '+3 Damage +3 Clip' on the upper tool, and on the lower tool I have 4 '+3 Reload' circuits purely for the fact that Reload circuits are the only ones that effect the weapon as a whole.

TL;DR:
The Plasma Cutter is still strong as ever, You can find my setup in the links :)

It's not because it uses auto-save, that's fine. But it doesn't do a very good job at telling you **when** and **what** it saves. 

It will pop up a message every now and then telling you either ""*inventory saved*"" or ""*progress saved*"". So you have to look at the message to figure out what it actually did. And is there really a difference? I haven't found out yet.

Whatever the case it's just way too easy to quit the game, just to be set back a couple of minutes and having to replay something you already died countless times to. Why can't I continue at the last checkpoint? Because that's certainly what you expect the first few times. It seems to save progress every time you go through an air-lock .. but who knows.

And then, when you **do** quit it tells you ""you're inventory will be saved""  .. well that just seems to be **a big fat lie**.

Slight tweaks to the look of the objective marker and a few other things kept it looking fresh.  The necros I faced were much creeper looking and a new kind not in the other games kept me on my toes.  it changed form depending on which limb you took off which meant I had to adapt quickly, very quickly in fact.

When the Steam Sales came around, I picked up both Dead Space and Dead Space 2 fairly cheap. I was building a new computer as well, so I had to wait a couple of months before I could play these games. When I got it built in October, I finally sat down and played and recorded my experience with Dead Space... It blew my god damn mind!

I have never felt so immersed in a game before, nor had I played a survival-horror game ever. So just the suspense long with the atmosphere just blew my mind all across the room. I never felt so satisfied with an ending boss. It was so good!

Then I played Dead Space 2. It was a very good game, it was pretty dang fun. A lot more action-y than the first but I was alright with that. It had more of an open spacial area so it accommodation to it. I enjoyed the end boss as well and enjoyed the tiny cliffhanger. I just beat the game 30 min. ago...

There was only one time had I come close to dying and that from accidently letting a crawler get too close, but other than that I was having no problems. Well I walk into a room when a Black Slasher spawns to the right of me in the corner. I stasis him, but had a feeling that there was more in the room than just him. So I turn to the left and there was an exploder about 15 feet away from me. I hadn't noticed the window when I walked into the room, so I just shot the infected part with ease, only to get sucked towards and crushed by the window lock because of the angle I was at didn't allow me to shoot the triangle at the top of the window.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE5Npasp4vI&amp;amp;sns=em


Now I'm obviously not the first person to post this here (obviously the movie has been out for 23 years so Im sure you all know about it) so I decided I'd take this a bit deeper.

I suppose the Codex is in Mahad’s hands by now, and this place is about to be buried, like everywhere else. **I remember telling my college professor I wanted to study xenoarcheology. He laughed right in my face. There’s nothing to study, he said. It’s all dead space.** No alien life exist out in the universe. In a way, I guess he was right. There is no life beyond our system, only a trail of extinction, wrought by the Moons. And now it’s right on our doorstep. Well, above us lies the means of turning off the Machine, but also the means to complete it. Turning it off will finish our species, completing it will save us. I had hoped to be here to witness the saving part. It would have been spectacular to witness the Moon getting pulled into the planet and crushed to oblivion - a final act by the natives - a sacrifice to save us all. But now, I must rest.

1355156869.0	14lybr	The Dead Space game I want to see	NorthStarZero	31	10	8	"I've been playing my way through the Western Gamer Canon, and I'm on the Dead Space series. Just finished DS1 and I'm now on Chapter 3 of DS2.

These are good games and I am enjoying them, but there's no getting around that the game is a series of scripted encounters. That's not a ""problem"" per sae; the game experience is basically an interactive horror film and that's cool. But the underlying mechanic of how a necro outbreak might play out in ""real life"" gives me an idea for a new kind of Dead Space game:

- Model a planet cracker in its entirety - every door opens, every area has a purpose, and the floor plan layout is designed with an eye towards how an actual ship would be laid out. No twisty little mazes because the puzzle or experience demands it; instead, make the ship ""realistic"";

- Create a crew manifest, and assign a model to each member of the crew. Each crew member is placed in an area of the ship where he/she would normally be;

- Each crew member has a simple AI: if they are in a room with a necro - freeze in place, unless they have encountered a fleeing crew member before, in which case, flee. If they see a necro kill/infect someone - flee. If fleeing, and they encounter a crew member who is not, pass on the ability to flee;

- At the start of the game, an infector is spawned somewhere in the ship. Infector AI: if it can smell a corpse, move towards it. It it finds a corpse, infect it and create a slasher. If it cannot smell a corpse, move towards crew and infect it. If it can smell the player, avoid it;

- Slasher AI: If it can smell the player, move towards it. If it cannot smell the player but can smell crew, move towards (and kill) crew;

""Smell"" allows necros to detect other actors a couple of rooms away.

Necros cannot open doors, but can move through vents (which need not be 3D modelled but do need to be virtually modelled) Necros can only move one room at a time through vents and must exit the vent in the next room along the travel path, pause in that room, ""smell"", and then move in the direction smell compels them (which may or may not involve vent travel)

Necros do not drop loot, and MUST be fully dismembered to stop attacking

Once the infection starts, it moves through the ship according to the AI rules - slashers killing crew, and the infector reanimating the corpses. The aim of the game is to stop the necro infection and save as much of the crew as possible.

Issac starts in the prospecting room - this is a space off the main ore processing space where the ship's geologists can examine samples of the rock currently being worked. The geologists use plasma cutters to blast chunks off the sample for analysis, and Issac is fixing a broken plasma cutter when the infection starts.

The plasma cutter does not have ammo; instead, it has a supply hose. All the spaces used for ore working / sample analysis have plasma supply sockets in their workspaces where the cutter can be plugged in. In one room, Issac will find a remote plasma cart that the cutter can plug into, but the cart must be plugged in to an electrical power source (allowing the cutter to move through the ship)

All other weapons are similarily improvised - a medical cutter may be used to create a weapon, but it too must be plugged in to function. 

There is a weapons locker on board, and it holds ALL the ammo that is on board

That's the rough outline. Not the same game at all - but a good one, I think."	t5_2r5qf	True
1350872812.0	11vio9	Dead Space 3 worries	nojo-ke	25	6	26	Having seen most of the trailers, gameplay, demos, etc released, a few things are starting to worry me.  First there is the fact that it has coop, I think a big part of how tense and terrifying the previous installments could be was the feeling of absolute loneliness that pervades so much of each game, and I feel that having a buddy to chat with really weakens that.  Second, it seems like they're making the character to agile, with the character now having the ability to role away from necromorphs very quickly, taking away from that panic and urgency that accompanied having an enemy right on top of you.  And lastly there's the new environment.  Tau Volantis, or at least what we've seen of it, seems a little to open, well lit and generally less menacing than Titan Station and the USG Ishimura.

Terakian	23	4	23	"Regretfully it took me 40% of the game to figure out what was going on - that ""save and quit"" only saved your inventory, not your actual progress in the story. The only way to save your progress is through the far and apart auto-saves, often mandating 45 minutes to an hour of play to actually progress and not lose what you've done. If you've not already played the game - this means that if you quit before an autosave happens - your inventory will be there, as well as unlocked doors and solved puzzles, but you will still need to fight through all the waves of enemies, even boss-magnitude enemies, that you defeated previously. Do you know of any other games that do this? Why is the mechanic a good idea? I feel like most games, when you click ""save,"" save exactly where you are at that moment."	t5_2r5qf	True

Some logs tell you of Serrano encountering some soldiers carving symbols onto their own skin and holding certain artifacts. 

You also get a good look at regenerators without them being able to kill you, and you are able to see that they do have symbols etched into their skin as well. [I don't recognize the symbols from marker/unitologist script though.](http://images.wikia.com/deadspace/images/c/c3/DS3_Regenerator_Profile.png )

At the end of the mission you pick up something labeled the ""Artifact Manifest"" in the room with the storage container and then... nothing. No corresponding audio or text log comes after and you just make your escape. 

It just feels like there would have been some sort of log detailing the artifacts the soldiers had, and how it turned them into regenerators. After all, I assume it was the SCAF that put the regenerators in those boxes and might have noted something about it.

I guess you could say I manned up a bit, before I always just finished medical for the first time and thought 'fuck this' and turned it off. How wrong I had been, the music and the use of sound is incredible. The scare techniques they use keep you on edge the whole time, especially when you walk into a dark room and all sound goes away. *shudders* and the 'necromorphs?' are some of the most terrifying aliens on game 'for me' since the flood on Halo. It takes a while for me to get use to the controls each time I re-started it, but once I finished chapter one it's fine, this is just a tiny flaw in a truly amazing game, and flaw I might add that most players may not suffer from.

Especially with what happens in chapter 12, I felt sorry for Isaac and actually warmed to his character. Anyway sorry for the long post, I got excited and had lots of things on my mind.

It has great elements and totally worth playing again. The parts where *Vandal* hallucinates or has effects of dementia is a fantastic way to feel immersed in the game.

I found it great and I'd like to see a sequel with some of DS2's elements, such as:

-Zero G maneuvering
-
-Better animation when changing suits
-
-More Suits
-
-More Weapons
-

But DS3 has ""just"" been released with the new weapon crafting system which I think shouldn't be included because it's kinda OP being able to create a *super-gun* which you would never have been able to get even close to in the previous games.

Although I haven't played any DS game in the past few weeks I keep dreaming about it. My dream either is all about DS or half way through any random dream necromorphs break in and shit gets awesome =D

But this night, April 16th, I had a different dream. I'll try to describe what came into my mind in my dream and how I worked it out after I woke up.

A storyline for DS4. The character you're playing is Ellie. After the final battle and Isaac dying Ellie goes into hyperspace. 

Prologue: Ellie heads towards planet earth, as it is the last necromorph free place she can think off. The moon has become a necromorph breeding ground due to the release of the marker in DS3 by the Unitologists. When approaching earth Ellie's ship is halted by EarthGov military ships. She is arrested, put under stasis and brought to an earth based EarthGov facility. 

This is when shit got real in my dream. Lets fast forward a year or 2.

EarthGov has been experimenting on how to reverse the changes in DNA that turns humans into necromorphs, growing arms out of their back, tentacles out of babies, and so on. Imagine the DS2 beginning. Isaac is being interrogated/experimented upon on how to build markers. That’s the kind of surrounding you’re playing in. All close quarters, necromorphs be comin’ from errywere!

EarthGov has captured several specimen of necromorphs from the moon and have taken them to a facility where EarthGov uses a mixture of their DNA and that of non-infected humans to create some kind of hybrid being on which to perform DNA-experiments. The Necro-humans. Necro-humans come in multiple forms of mental state and physical appearance. There are violent loners. Those that will fuck up anyone or anything in their path. There are stable, social Necro-humans. These will stay in groups and can be interacted with. They have accepted their fate and try to make the most of it. There are Necro-humans that are plagued by bipolary. They can express sympathy, but turn violent by any wrong move. These are by far the most dangerous as you might try to get their assistance they can open a can of whoop-ass on you and you’ll be running for your live. Then you have the standard necromorphs from DS1,2 and 3 for the casual killing. 

You/Ellie, have also been turned into a Necro-human. One of the bipolar once. The telepathic signal coming from the moon based marker gives you Isaac like dementia/flashbacks as it tries to get control over you. This dementia/flashbacks can be used to bring Isaac back under the idea that every person affected by the marker signal get 'saved' in the marker 'memory'. You could have Ellie go into a violent flashback where she looks trough Isaacs eyes as he plays in DS1 and 2. Or Isaac could see trough Ellie’s eyes and try to aid her in her survival.

Things turn bad when the (standard)necromorphs from the moon break out of their chambers and start messing around. Eventually releasing also the Necro-humans. These will scatter around the facility. 

Lets imagine DS3 Ellie, but with bladed arms and all other kinds of nasty shit growing out of her back and rest of her body. An important part of the game would be that as you’re moving through the facility you find parts of the DNA-research done by EarthGov. With these parts you can go to something that would be like a suit kiosk. Except you now get to use these DNA-samples to become either a more stronger, more violent necromorph, or you become less necromorph, more human. 

Like choosing between the path of good and evil. Do you become more necromorph and does the marker signal gets a stronger hold on you giving you telepathic orders on how to escape the facility and let your fellow necromorphs turn planet earth into a necromorph breeding ground / marker home world. Or… Do you become more human with EarthGov helping you escape the facility and going out destroying the necromorphs and the moon marker?

When choosing the path of the necromorph, spreading death and destruction where ever you go you are able to use the DNA-samples to gain more abilities. Like the bile puke, the tentacle darts, wall climbing and/or vent crawling. You would be up against EarthGov soldiers and Necro-humans that sympathize with EarthGov or those who are working against you in general.

When choosing the path of the human, spreading death and destruction where ever you go you are able to use the DNA-samples to regain parts of your normal body allowing you to use crude tools, which you can then upgrade/improve at benches, just like in DS3. Under no circumstances should these be effective or strong. No ista-killing anything. You run for as fast as you can as long as you can using maybe the EarthGov sympathizing Necro-humans to aid you or weapons/tools given to you by them or EarthGov.

As a necromorph. After clearing the facility of EarthGov and EarthGov sympathizers you get to a point where you help in finishing a marker that was under construction deep within the facility. This will spread glorious convergence all over earth. Resulting in a true marker home world from where on the marker signal can be spread.

As a human after clearing the facility of necromorphs you never learn about the earth based marker that was under construction. Instead you join the forces of EarthGov as you turn your attention to destroying the moon marker. This will make for some DS2 styled combat. As you were moving through the sprawl on Titan going from building through building. You are now going through moon housing structures.  Then you get to the marker base which after an epic boss battle will be destroyed killing off all the moon necromorphs. 

However. Surviving Necro-humans in the facility will find out about the earth based marker and try to complete its construction. Making them ‘whole’ again. This will allow for a DS5 to be made.

Please let me know what you think of this. Tips are welcome too. I might be able to expand it."	t5_2r5qf	True

Bottom Circuits: [+3 Reload](To max out reload speed)

Fiddled around with my Plasma Cutter until I came upon this build.  Best gun I have made yet.  I used the MK-V Explosion Amplifier for the extra ammo and to complement my second gun (that I don't even use).  Feel free to substitute any MK-V attachment.  

This gun is an absolute beast and cuts through limbs like a hot knife through butter.  The Flame Glaze mod makes the analogy even more appropriate.  Ran through impossible with just this gun.  Big enemies (for no spoilers) at the end are made into shooting targets for this gun.  Shoot at one of their arms and they will flinch.  The high rate of fire renders them practically immobile.  Everything with two legs; do the classic legs+crotch shot for immediate amputation.  Dark version of enemies takes two shots to amputate. 

Any suggestions on how to improve this gun?  I'm sure this gun has been made before, just wanted to enlighten those who may have not seen this gun.  Try it out and feel bad for the Necromorphs.

1360640516.0	18ctfb	Ammo conservation/How clips work	ngene	15	3	10	"One clip reloads 25% of a gun. What this means:

* Constantly topping off a magazine on a weapon (shooting one bullet and reloading) wastes a clip per reload.
* Reloading a gun from empty uses up 4 clips. If you reload both the upper and lower guns from empty, you use up 8 clips.
* If you want an ammo efficient weapon, +clip upgrades are the way to go, along with a weapon that does decent damage.

Some of my favorite combinations that are light on ammo:

**Rivet Gun/SMG** - Compact Frame + Telemetry Spike (Upper) + Military Engine

* The rivets do absurd amounts of damage for the huge clip size, and the SMG is for when things get hairy or for long-range shooting. Great gun all around.

**Flaming Shotgun/Suspended Ripper** - Heavy Frame + Miltary Engine-Conic Dispersal (Upper) + Rip Core + Flame Glaze

* Shotguns have a pretty huge mag for a heavy weapon and do great damage at decent ranges, but has an abysmal fire rate. On the plus side, the Ripper functions really well as a backup AND you can fire the shotgun while you have a saw out. Win-win!

**Carbine/Force Gun** - Heavy Frame + Military Engine + Plasma Core

When the red markers are made it infects all dead bodys with the virus, turning them into hostile beings, when enough bodys are obtained the marker will reach convergence, infecting the entire planet making a brethren moon.

1360141622.0	17zp04	Mad props to the supporting characters. [SPOILERS!]	Lolawalrus51	16	1	0	"So I just finished the campaign on normal mode, and I have to say, all the supporting characters really help make this game a fulfilling experience. I loved all the actor's performances, but it's how the three main characters (Issac, Ellie, Carver) interact and treat the other side characters that makes this games story engrossing.

Each of the supporting survivors, as I'll call them, contribute to the game a hell of a lot more than I thought that they would, and through the course of the game I felt my attitudes towards them changing.

For example: [At first, I was exceptionally neutral to Santos. She at first seemed like a very flat character, and I wasn't expecting much from her. But as the game progressed she became a valuable asset in the mission, and also provided much needed humanity.](/spoiler)

[The scene where she has a slight break down after Norton is killed tugged at my heartstrings. After all, she's never been thought this before (so far as we know), so this is all just absolute insanity to her. She's no genius engineer or hardened Ex-EarthGov soldier. She's just a lady doing her job. I sincerely wish that she had survived this ordeal, but I also think that her death was a major contribution to Issac's character development. To wrap up my talk about Santos, I have to say that she will be missed.](/spoiler)

My Next example is also fairly obvious. [Lots of games have characters that you love to hate, but DS3 has a character that you gradually begin to hate over time, but then are slightly disappointing when they get their just deserts. Yes, I'm talking about Norton. I'll be honest, I kind of liked Norton to begin with, but after it became apparent that Issac's relationship with Norton would be soured over his relationship with Ellie, I decided to like him less. And less. And even less. Until I hated that god damn self righteous cunt for leaving Issac locked in the damn cage after just tromping through the intestines of a gigantic necromorph. Seriously, who the FUCK does that shit?](/spoiler)

But alas, it's not all as it seems. [We think that Norton is a coward who just wants to GTFO, but he actually cares about Ellie, which is surprising because I never really sensed that Ellie cared as much about Norton as he did about her. Until Issac kills him of course, that's a whole different ballgame.](/spoiler)

All in all, I'm really glad that Dead Space 3 expands upon its cast list to make for a more human experience in a very hostile and un-human world.

That's just my opinion however. I was going to do a more in depth analyses on people like the other old guy member of Ellie's team, opposite Santos, who's name I cant remember off the top of my head. I also was going to do one on Danik, but it's 3 am here, so all I can say about him is this. 

[Fuck off Danik. You giant prick.](/spoiler)"	t5_2r5qf	True

I picked it up for the first time in a few years about a week ago (I never owned it, but loved it so much I went out and bought the first and second one two weeks ago.)

As i'm playing through the first one, I'm thinking how I remember certain parts and how fun they were. I get to the end [when you're putting the marker onto the platform and you go into the lockdown.](/spoiler) Then Kendra comes out of nowhere and begins to [take the marker. She then tells you Nicole has been dead this whole time.](/spoiler) My question is: Kendra knew this information the entire time. At the beginning of game, Hammond keeps saying things like, [""We'll find Nicole, Isaac.""](/spoiler) How much does Hammond really know? Does he know everything, or [does he die before we can find anything out about what he knows?](/spoiler)

I had some concerns about the length after watching the extended developer commentary, but the length and price definitely match up.  I found it to be slightly harder (playing on normal), but that might just be because I hadn't played since beating the main story.

As for the content itself, wow.  I definitely feel like they were at least trying to respond to some of the criticisms regarding the lack of horror elements, especially for chapter 2 and some of 3.  The ""fights"" with Randall felt especially tense, probably even more so after seeing the kill animation he puts Issac through in the preview video (the saw decapitation).

I honestly don't see how there can be any more story to tell though after that ending though.  Is there really any practical way to say that Issac survived, or that anything of earth is left?  How many brother moons did we see in that final cinematic?  3? 4?  We can probably assume there are more that weren't in view.

At 28, I am old enough to remember cheat codes being prevalent in the majority of games and loved it when I found out that DS1 had codes as well. 

Did the codes make Isaac too over powered early in the game (assuming that is when most people used the node and credits codes)? I assume the codes to refill your air and stasis defeated the purpose of finding cans of air and stasis refills and took out some of the desperation atmosphere the game was trying to create.

Just had some questions about the Dead Space universe.

1. Why did they want Altman to become a martyr?

2. Do all markers work the same? Do they all emit the frequency that change dead cells into... well ...necromorphs? If so, what is the point of infectors?

3. In Dead Space 2, was the Site 12 marker the origin of the Titan Station outbreak? I was always confused about the source of the outbreak.

4. Why did EarthGov want to build the Site 12 marker in the first place? 

5. What is the relationship between EarthGov and Unitology?

Thanks a lot. I haven't played DS 1/2 is quite some time, started to wonder about these in prep for 3.

I for one just finished it and is currently playing it again on Pure Survival. I think the dlc is brilliant because it gave the game a second run to show people that Visceral is still capable of making something really scary. 


I REALLY enjoyed Carver in this dlc, he felt kind of absent from the main game. I really enjoyed Isaac's dementia and the hard times I had to distinct reality and fantasy. The story was good, fast paced, and to the point. 


The new monsters and the redesigned ""Pack"" was great as well. Those ""mother-in-law"" brute/stalkers were a good threat. The pack looks awesome now, I'm happy they went mad with the redesign. 

I wish however that the cult leader was a bigger threat. Like that he would've followed you around from the moment you stepped onto the Terra Nova. Like hearing his whispers and voices throughout. And I wish they would've made something unexpected with the trams. Like that it would explode or be attacked by regenerators and you have to stasis the threat until you arrive. Just something more unexpected there.

The third one ... ooooo the third one I just came back from I made it to the part where you go to get your snow suit and I pop the gear into the hatch and i go to open the elevator next to dead ass Mr. Buckle and I step inside of the elevator. I get to the bottom of the elevator and the door opens and for some reason Issac didn't move.. he wouldn't move he just stood and stared out from the elevator door non responsive... I don't know what happened... he just stood there... and then ... melted... he literary like ... all his limbs just popped off... and he fell to pieces on the ground ... didn't even scream ... nothing just ... a pile of plopping body parts .... now I'm not sure if I'm cursed or some shit to a detonating Issac but I'm done... I can't play a game where its not the enemies or cheap ass death parts kill me .... but where I survive all that bull shit just to have my self fucking MELT from FUCKING NOTHING &gt;:|"	t5_2r5qf	True

I really liked Sunshine (movie) and think  Danny Boyle would make an excellent thriller for a DS movie. Event Horizon was another great one but Paul W.S. Anderson has really bombed with the AVP and Resident Evil movies  but maybe he could ??

The developers of Dead Space once said in an interview that while Dead Space had a lot of ideas from various things, probably the two most influential pieces of media for the game was [Event Horizon] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119081/) and [The Thing] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/?ref_=sr_1).

Both are movies that I have thoroughly enjoyed watching, and playing Dead Space was all that much more intriguing having seen the films that influenced it the most.

1363193419.0	1a82h5	Awakened DLC Review - Discussion / How bad did it scare you?	danthaman15	18	5	26	"Before you read this post, drop everything and play the Awakened DLC. You'll be glad you did. Don't let what anyone says about it hype you up. Just download it and play it for yourself. 

Review:

Dead Space Awakened gave me nightmares. I'm seriously not kidding. After finishing it, I made my way through my darkened house and went to bed, being treated to dreams of dismemberment.

It wasn't Necros being dismembered in my dreams, however. 

Being hailed as a return to the horror we were all hoping for in DS3, Awakened has been heavily hyped the last few months . The devs announced that the entire DLC is basically a love letter to the classic horror of the franchise, and is a treat for hardcore fans who did not like the action approach to the last game.

I'm proud to say they delivered on all fronts. Awakened is seriously the darkest and most disturbing of *any* of the Dead Space content I've played. Those who have only played the third game or are more in tune with the ""action horror"" feel of the last 2 games will likely be caught of guard by the sudden onslaught of disturbing content.

I won't spoil any plot here, but I was impressed with how the change in tone from action to horror was explained in the story, making the horror very easy to swallow. Had the DLC just been a scare fest for no reason after the action tone of the main game, it would have felt like fanservice, but the shift in tone has actual plot significance.

What took me off guard here was the *ferocity* of the horror. There isn't any sugarcoating for a broad audience here. The entire DLC is a relentless attack on the senses. Gone is the ""taking charge"" attitude of the second and third game, back is the feeling of mystery and hopelessness of Dead Space 1. You come out of firefights feeling frazzled and dreading the next encounter. Like the 1st game, there is no ""relief"" moment throughout the entire 3 chapter campaign. The scares simply continue mounting one after another, and the game never rewards you after a firefight with a cutscene or ""break room"". This gives Awakened a fever pitch of intensity that I seriously did not expect, considering the toned down ""action movie"" nature of Dead Space 3. But most, and best of all, the general *feel* of the first game is recreated here. The sense of mystery, of ""WTF is going on?!?"", the mounting dread of opening the next door or turning the next corner, the alien feel of your environment, ect. This is the Dead Space 3 the fans wanted.

So how is everything else? Thankfully, the other factors of the DLC manage to hold up as well. The pacing is more in tune with the previous games; Isaac travels through a variety of environments, keeping things fresh and interesting (admittedly though, the environments are rehashed from Dead Space 3, but redone to keep things interesting). Part of why the horror works so well is the plot taking a simplistic and backseat role, reentering the scene when necessary. Once again, this is a great way of recreating the feel of the first game. The lack of a true driving force for the characters besides survival helps keep you in the moment for the horror. 

Are there any negatives? Alas, there are a few. The DLC is short as hell, too short for $10, but this has been a general problem with DLC from the beginning of DLC itself, so I'm not holding it against Awakened. However, there is a feel that the devs had not run out of ideas before the ending, so some extended playtime certainly seemed possible. The opening Tau Volantis chapter is a tad weak, and one of the new enemies turns out to merely be an admittedly creepy looking new skin for the Stalker enemy, one that you only actually face in 1-2 firefights. Tau Volantis just isn't very scary, but things are kept interesting enough until you reach a ship and get to the Terra Nova, where the horror decides to hit full blast. 

Ultimately, this DLC is a love letter to the franchise, and one that will give Dead Space fans the dose of horror they were hoping for. It's short, so I recommend taking your time, but you're in for a treat.

**TL;DR** Awakened is a herald back to the horror of the last 2 games, and will be enjoyed immensely by hardcore fans.

What did you think of Awakened? Did it scare you? Was it worth your time?

- It's an 2011 animation. Downfall was made in 2008 and it had great elements for a horror animation (anime?*).

Well these are only my notes on the film.

SPOILERS START HERE

In the first game I'm confused about the Marker's intentions. I think it influenced both Kyne and Isaac so they would return it to Aegis VII, but why? That'd mean the Necromorphs would be dormant and bringing the Marker caused the total destruction of the planet and itself. Was that meant to happen or was it a mistake by the Marker? Basically I'd like to know what were the Red Marker's intentions in the first game.

On the second, I understand the Marker wants to absorb the creators, Nolan and Isaac, to start the Convergence and be whole. And why in the first game the Necromorphs never seemed to try and go to the Marker to start the Convergence? Although I think they did try on Downfall, however I'm not sure how cannonical are the films regarding some details.

-------------

Here's a few questions I'd like to see the answers to: 

- Do Rate of Fire circuits decrease the time needed to charge a shot for weapons like the Contact Beam, Tesla Beams, and the like, or do they just decrease the refire time between firing and being able to start charging the next shot?

- Do Reload circuits on lower tools have any effect on reload times? I've heard that the reload time is dependent on the upper tool, but there's no clear in indication that this is the case, as the differences are often difficult to discern.

- Do Clip circuits just increase the number of rounds in a magazine, or do they also increase the actual capacity of individual clips as well? For example: 1 clip contains 3 shots worth of Plasma Cutter ammunition, and a Plasma Cutter, by default, holds 4 (3+3+3+1) clips worth. Does adding Clip circuits just increase the capacity of the weapon, or is it possible to make a clip contain 4 or 5 shots worth for the Plasma Cutter?

- Do different engines or tips have different, independent rates of increase from each circuit, or is it merely a factor of how large the particular variables are to begin with? That is, the effect of a Clip upgrade tends to be small; is that different even between weapons with the same base clip size, or is the increase based entirely on the original clip size? I suspect that it is just based on the original variable, without regard for the specific part or weapon type, but I'm not certain.

1362297472.0	19kh6t	Dead Space 3 spoilers and rant	JoshuaSwartz	18	7	61	"I have a semi rant that I want to share with you. Before I begin, please understand that you may think i'm insane, or nit picky, and you may very well be right. One last thing, Dead Space and Dark souls are my top lore based games I've ever played, so don't get the wrong Idea here.

So basically at the end of Dead Space 3, Isaac and Carver say numerous times, they aren't going to live. Well.. They do it seems and this is something that bugs me. The idea of an unkillable character. Now i'm not saying Isaac is immortal, but what I am saying is that tricking someone only works once. 

So Isaac and Carver live!, Woopee, so cool, but why? Why keep a character around after setting the ground level of his impending doom? It's one of the most cliche things ever made in the history of story telling. The idea of the hero escaping an impossible scenario. Now when you have this as a plot point, and can predict it well and let's be honest here, almost every story has one or more of these moments in it, making it very cliche and played out. I'm saying it strips ALL the tension away from the story, takes something about life and death and makes it about immortality.

Don't get me wrong, I like Isaac and Carver.. but be realistic here, would Isaac really survive this? He has no helmet, and debris is flying everywhere around him at high speeds. Now unless Isaac has some sort of amazing ability to kinisis himself to safety, he'd still have a concussion.

I'm sure some of you have heard of a show called 'Heroes'. Well, in Heroes, there's countless times when a character should die, but doesn't. Noah Bennet, a Heroes character has around 4 times where he has literally said his death speech and is seconds away from passing away, yet help comes. Now the first time this happens, I was thinking, ""Oh damn, that sucks man"". The second time, ""man.."" an then from then on it was, ""w/e, just get to the part where you're saved"" This destroys any tension or drama that could proceed it, in fact, the scene was useless cause all it did was waste time.

Now i'm not saying, everyone should die, but what I am saying is having immortal characters really detracts from enjoyment for me. The show 'Dexter' had a part where I seriously thought Dexter was going to die, no doubt in my mind about it happening, I knew from that moment anything could happen. I didn't have this pre notion of he's going to live. The writers never gave any clues of what would actually happen. Mainly cause the series didn't need him, sure it's nice to have him as a character but he isn't necessary.

Now another example, The Walking Dead comics. No one is safe, you're human, you have limitations. At any point, you might die. You know this and yet the series gives you hope that you know damn well wont amount to anything, what kind of future would it have? Shit, i'm slightly off topic. The walking dead says ""fuck you"" to immortal characters. Tension is constant and you never know what will happen for the most part anyway, let's not get to carried away.

Presentation: Depending on how you use the element of surviving impending doom matters a great deal, at least to me. Take for example 'Pulp Fiction', Samuel L Jackson's character faced certain doom, but he lived. Was this a useless scene? No it wasn't, it added to his character, it changed the flow of how the story progressed. Something happens in that scene, he saw what he thought to be god and it changed his life. While movies like 'The Avengers'(great movie) for example, have Iron man seem to die.. but this can't be, he has to live. Now is this the same as 'Pulp Fiction'? No, but it's not bad either cause it's in the spirit of the writing. A comedy about super hero's can't die, that's not how it works. This kind of movie is different, it's not about seeing someone die in a gruesome way, it's about fun an suspense. While something like Dead Space is filled with death, there's no inherent justice in this world, it's chaos. No super hero's exist in Dead Space's world. 

There's one other way of tricking the audience in killing a character and this one bugs me to hell. Actually killing the character and having some deus ex machina child's tear bring him back to life. Granted it depends on the story type. Something like pokemon? Excusable, because it's more of a kids movie. However, something like Dead Space? God no. The idea of killing a character just to bring him back wastes time in most cases, especially in a story that's trying to be semi realistic in it's ideals. If you watch or read any Dead Space lore, you'll understand when I say, Dead space tries to create it's own world based on physics and logic. Well for the most part anyway, the markers are kind of a deus ex machina at times. Now stuff like Dragon ball Z bringing people back to life isn't as big of a deal cause the story usually isn't that great, you want the fighting. So you tend not to care about one area over another. A simple trade off based on the creators playing to their strengths instead of trying to be a jack of all trades.

In conclusion to this fuck heap of a thought, I think Dead Space 3 lost some of it's spirit in the third game, at least in terms of the story twist. It was shallow and pretty predictable. I am however not going to lie to you and say I wasn't sitting at the edge of my chair hoping to see that Isaac lived, cause I damn well was. The effect of Isaac living vs dying is tricky, if he lives it's instant gratification while if he died it's a much deeper sense of gratification. He gave his life to give humanity another chance and perished. It would feel horrible at first, then slowly(at least me) you would start to see a much bigger gratification, something that can't be done when the end has no casualties. Casualties meaning, not just people, but anything. 

Ah jeez, i'll go on for days at this rate, so i'll cut this now. Tell me what you think, if i'm missing a point, or if i'm dumb for thinking the way I do. Either way, thanks for your time.

1361052442.0	18npxw	Question - stuck on Chapter 19	Nonbeing	11	1	4	"First playthrough, Impossible difficulty

I'll try to describe the part I am stuck at: I've already traveled over that flying pad thing that makes you shoot through the air like a rocket (navigating through rocks and stuff). The part I am stuck on is shortly after that. I go down the path, kill two of those super-fast necromorphs, then I reach an area where a tentacle is blocking the path, and about 5 or 6 regular black necromorphs spawn (they crawl out over some fences, one by one).

I assumed the tentacle would stop blocking the path after I killed all the necromorphs, but it doesn't. I will kill them, one by one, until they stop spawning... but nothing happens. The wall of destruction just catches up with me and kills me.

Do I have to kill the tentacle too? I tried shooting it's yellow weak spot but it doesn't seem to do anything.

How do I get past this spot? Thanks!

Thus, if you add circuits for +clip size, you will get more shots per ammo unit consumed. (if your PC has 10 shots, thus 2.5shots=1 ammo, but if you have 16 shots in a clip. then 4 shots=1ammo)

After that I grabbed another friend, who had already completed the game and we started to play on Hard difficulty. Still have overstock of items. And enemies are not so challenging.(Maybe because of OP guns, but whatever).

1359764416.0	17q6k9	Ever had a Dead Space nightmare?	Borgoff55	10	1	13	"I am very curious to see how many (if any) people have had nightmares as a result of playing Dead Space 1 or 2. 
For myself, I never had any in the past while playing the Dead Space games. I actually had one in the last couple weeks after replaying Dead Space 1. In the dream I was playing Dead Space 3 and I had almost beat the game. Then, suddenly, the big reveal occurred. Isaac was actually Nicole the whole time! Holy crap, that scared the crap outa me. I can honestly say that revelation was more horrifying than anything that ever occurred in the games. Jeez. "	t5_2r5qf	True
1359679874.0	17ny7d	Dead Space 3 Body Temperature Display	Slightly_Askew	12	5	19	On the [Dead Space 3 Wikia Page](http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Dead_Space_3#Trivia) it mentions that body temperature will be displayed while on Tau Volantis. But these are supposed to be hard vacuum rated suits they're wearing, which go out into space where it can be as low as 2.725 Kelvin, or -454.72 Fahrenheit. Why would being in sub zero Fahrenheit conditions on a planet be colder than being in space where it's near absolute zero?	t5_2r5qf	True

1359410366.0	17gd0y	Dead Space Sub - Changes/Mod News !	nicolauz	11	1	9	"Just a friendly reminder that there will be some upcoming changes before the release of the new Dead Space game ! I'm hoping everyone here is enjoying the sub and is pumped to slice and dice in the new game. There will be a few new changes implimented to help keep the spam/over posts as well as repeat questions being filtered out.

A few changes that will be detailed in the next few weeks:


---

*Weekly Let's Play/Video Blog Roll Posts - Instead of the flux of everyone wanting to post their scary/funny/diarrhealicious overtaking the sub we'll allow a weekly post for you to put your Let's Play video along with a description of what makes it unique or why we should watch.

---

*New Text Flair - I think adding text flair would help people find friends here on the sub for co-op. Just add your system (PS3 - nicolauz/ 360 - nicolauz/ PC ect) along with your Gamertag or username).

---
*Weapon Crafting Posts -  Much like the Let's Play. It's great to share weapon ideas and crafting techniques. We'll start a weekly- bi-weekly weapon crafting posts.

---
*FAQ/Sidebar - I'd love some help crafting out a bigger description/sidebar. Suggestions appreciated.

---
I'll also be adding some new image flair's from the DS3 achievement list next week.

Any other idea's or concerns are greatly encouraged as a great community is only as good as it's community involvement !  I look forward to the next following weeks. Thanks again.

1357843931.0	16bt6q	Buying Dead Space 2. Have some questions		13	3	13	"I just finished DS1 and loved it. Now I'm lookin to buy the second but I have some questions before I do.

If I buy used will I not be able to play online? Does DS2 come with an online code? Should I just buy it new?

Also, which is best: DS2, DS2 Game of the Year Edition, DS2 Limited Edition.

Anything else I should know? Basically I'm trying to decide if I can buy used or not and which edition I should get if I can. Thanks!"	t5_2r5qf	True
1357611774.0	165pfn	Why does Isaac wear a jacket in DS3?	UltimateUltamate	12	1	8	"Isn't he already wearing a sealed space suit? I double the climate of the planet is colder than... *space*

Maybe its to keep moisture from freezing his suit up? He's practically swam through rivers of blood without showing it, so I doubt very much congeals to him. 

He must just want to look stylish for his new friend."	t5_2r5qf	True
1356494702.0	15g9ba	Just got both dead spaces for Christmas...some complaints....	ispillthings	15	5	42	"So I got dead space and I have been playing it for the past few days (I'm on Chapter 6 on the first game) and I have a few complaints (dont worry they arent meant to be taken seriously) I F***ING HATE THE ASTEROID LEVEL. IT TOOK ME SOOOO LONG TO BEAT. Next on my agenda is the hunter. Scariest thing in my life would have to be that damn thing. I wasted almost all of my cutter rounds in it until i remembered, HEY I HAVE STASIS. So after running through and Mercer got all the air out, I ran into the room with the hunter and the fat dudes. So when I got to that part the hunter dismembered me so I set my controller down and left...but i finished it this morning XD I love this game so much right now and i would like to talk with some people about it. Just please, no spoilers.
