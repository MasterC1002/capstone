Alright, ruling out that winter is coming, comets becoming crashed into us, the Others attacking, and the Sun exploding, we're definitely going to blow ourselves up.

Hokay, so basically we've got Targaryens, Baratheons, Starks, Lannisters, Tyrells, Martells, Greyjoys, and Arryns ... with armies. (The Targaryan girl has fire-breating dragons... whatever.)

Henyway, one day, we decide, ""those Lannister sonsofbitchs are going down!"" So we take a Lannister hostage. While it's on its way, the Lannisters are like ""Shit, shit! Who the fuck is framing us? Oh well! Kill Ned Stark!""

Then the Jorah is like ""Shit Dany...we got war in the West, let's fire up our shit!"" 

""But I am le tired.""

""Then have a three-book-long nap, THEN FIRE THE DRAGONS.""

Meanwhile, Sothoryos is down there like, ""wtf, mates?""

The Martells, Arryns, and Greyjoys all freak out, so we have betrayal and war going everywhere, doublecrossing and murdering each other. And Stannis is like ""AHHH TRUE KING OF WESTEROS."" 

Then the Others are like ""Bout that time, eh chaps? ... Righto.""

So now the Starks are like ""Fuck we're dumbasses."" The Wall's like ""What's going on, eh?"" And Sothoryos is still like ""wtf?"" The Boltons are laughing at us. And Bloodraven is like ""well fuck that.""

So now Westoros is the land of always winter, and heveryone's dead 'cept Sothoryos. And they're still like ""wtf?"" But they'll be dead soon. Fucking hairy apes.

But assuming we don't freeze ourselves up, we just have to worry about Sam and Gilly fleeing across the Narrow Sea. To go hang with Arya. 

Tyrion can come too.

The end!
