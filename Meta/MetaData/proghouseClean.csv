1359900614.0	17t1r3	New progressive house subreddit, need your opinion.	sassanix	47	6	25	"Hi guys,

Since we've been getting bombarded with commercialized electronic music labeled as progressive house I thought I should share some of my thoughts. Moderators , me specially I've been getting overwhelmed with the progressive house that is labeled on music stores such as beatport and then for it to be posted here.

I've waiting for more than 4 years for music stores to fix this issue but they haven't, so I'm just tired. 

Everyday I remove two or three new tracks and we only get few submissions here. It just feels like censorship now.

Who am I to tell others that a track is not progressive house, if the majority of you guys feel like the progressive trance and the big room house and the complextro that you post are in fact progressive house then be it.

For the sake of growth of this subreddit based on what the users feel I would no longer feel like I should moderate it the way I do now.

I will mainly focus on spam and the spamfilter and intervene when the users want me to.

I've noticed a trend that users here are downvoting real progressive house and upvoting the commercialized progressive house.

So I've opened up a new subreddit called /r/realproghouse with an actual objective of bringing progressive house lovers together, I don't want to hype it up but it's a movement of sorts and if you guys are against what I've done then please let me know.

I'm just tired, so I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

You humble moderator,

Sassan"	t5_2s5of	True

I know that people here (myself included) can get a little touchy when people refer to Swedish House Mafia as progressive house.  I know that Avicii-like posts are not permitted.  And so I wonder what the general consensus is about Mr Prydz.  I think his music is significantly better than the aforementioned acts however I think they have some significant elements in common.  I am no musical expert and I always have trouble describing music so for me the similarities are more about the *feel* of the songs.

Perhaps we can have a discussion about it?  I think the guy is a genius."	t5_2s5of	True

1376674018.0	1khzfu	I spent a long time on a comment posted in a thread focused on newcomers to the progressive house genre which didn't get that much attention. Included is a list of some my favorite tracks, artists and sub genres of progressive house. Enjoy!	delli	24	3	11	"So I'm going to assume you are new to the genre of progressive house because, for the most part, most people are introduced via deadmau5 and some of his most popular songs like Strobe, Jaded, Brazil, his remix of Calvin Harris' I'm Not Alone, etc etc.

So I'm gonna give you a wide variety of different types of house, some more progressive than others, and well see what you like the best.

First, we'll talk about a people like Mango, Dinka, Michael Cassette and EDX... a bit more ""chill"" than some of the famous deadmau5 tracks. Not as pronounced in terms of huge bass kicks and wild synths, these artists generally have more instrumentality to their tracks; not necessarily more ""musical"", but definitely a lot more to their tracks then just a bass kick and a fat synth lead.

Mango's [Here We Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_4x0OedR54) is one of my favorite. Perfect for a beach day. Not super in your face with a great sweeping melody and the bassline is deep but not overwhelming.

Speaking of beach days, Dinka's [On The Beach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74-wyCYmdcE) is such a great track. Sexy pads and synths like Dinka always has on her records with a fantastic guitar motif. I actually enjoy the [Arthur Deep Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzF2jN32HfQ) a bit more than the original, but I've never been able to find a download link to it :/


I've been loving Michael Cassettes latest track, which is actually his own rework: [Memories (90's Piano Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8yBuq_KHBg). I first heard this on Above and Beyond's Trance Around the World which, if you haven't heard of it, is a gold mine for tracks like this. I absolutely love the piano, and this record is like a blend of a great piano riff and a hard hitting bass line. Been on repeat for me the last couple of weeks.


EDX at the moment is one of my favorite artists all around. He's got great versatility, especially when he collaborates with different artists like Levantina and other members of the Helvetic Nerds. His sound can range from this *amazingly* chill original mix of [Everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLU1uomRv78), [Dinka's Elements Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VL6pLHrUVM) and the EDX remix of Kaskade's [Angel on My Shoulder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPmP0Qmo7s8) to hard hitting dance floor bombs like [Blood Pressure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEOtUAAvMsI) or the [Breakwater Ibiza Sunrise Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEcBhvo_iA) of Funkagenda. In any case, EDX is excellent and has an expansive discography as well. 


Moving on. Since you came here looking for deadmau5 type stuff, why don't we get into that? [Oneworld's Lingus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F6oCrBXBzQ) is a good place to start. Ecotek's [Forget About Tomorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmbHioa_SdM) is in the same boat. Both great tracks. Zach Roth's [Tourne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2Qm-WJMnbM) as well is a notable ""deadmau5-sounding"" record. Another one is [Zedd - Clarity (Tom Budin ""Not Deadmau5"" Remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uUVTsY5tXQ) which was a bit controversial because of obvious reasons, but a wonderful track nonetheless.

You want some stuff with lyrics? [Somewhere](http://vimeo.com/16021021) by DJ Mog is a great track, a bit generic, but I love it anyways. Pretty much all of Adam K and Soha's tracks are fantastic as well: Their remix of [Need to Feel Loved](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsJSwGc4lsA) is excellent, and the remix of [Rose of Jericho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLKshWcnVus) by BT is legendary. Their track [Twilight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAv-rN0nt8) is also great. [Aquila](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3T7PuQ3wMU) by Atlantis Ocean is also one of my favorite tracks of the last year or two. Great melody, fantastic production. [Chris Reece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBJbGqaIYGo) also has some great tracks.

There's some more ""trancey-sounding"" stuff which i love as well. Mat Zo is absolutely my favorite artist in this category right now. You've definitely heard [Rebound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXQhVmnNmxk) and probably [Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwLzZoB6y8A) which are both spectacular, but most likely you haven't heard his [Electrified](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiOhK9eNps) Remix or [Loop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzcRyEzHdiQ) or, my all time favorite, [It's Yours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KouVJTRBBIs). Check out AnjunaBeats and Anjunadeep for a ton more stuff like this. Also look into Jaytech, Oliver Smith, Andrew Bayer, Above and Beyond and Suspect 44. All of these artists deserve a look into.

Getting into a bit more of the mainstream, Wolfgang Gartner's rare departure from electro house into progressive with his remix of Sneaky Sound System's [I Will Be Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWYjC1IXL8k) is a classic in my opinion. Otto Know's (of [Million Voices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8jhXmfdRFY) fame) has a remix of ATB's [Twisted Love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U2Bc8aI5Og). 
There's also the obvious names: Kaskade, Zedd, Madeon, Swedish House Mafia, etc are are obligatory, but definitely firmly in the mainstream

Pryda and Eric Prydz (same person) are two legendary names. I could spend 15 minutes typing out all the classics they've produced, but I'll let you look into it if you're interested. Consistently the highest quality production in the industry, fantastic melodies and thumping bass lines, and a combination of simple harmonies with complex instrumentation. I'm not doing Prydz justice: check him out, or at least something like [Allein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6quPnsTnA8) or his remix of Digitalism's [Circles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT9xjEVEZ0c).

Finally, here are some track that I love that don't really fit into any of the above categories. 

[Kidnap Kid - Animaux](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej0eNZnPNEk)

[William Fitzsimmons - So This Is Goodbye (Pink Ganter)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwB56HQLFJY)

[Andrew Bayer feat. Ane Brun - Lose Sight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow2SEn1kTK8)

[Klangkarussell - Sonnentanz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMPYmNINxrE)

[Bakermat-Uitzicht](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX4GNDb4RSI)

[Jean Elan - Innuendo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u425KnOmSDM)

and finally, my current favorite track, [Nora En Pure - Come With Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spIyzp8XDn4)



So I kind of took a departure from the ""deadmau5"" sounding tracks, but you have to realize that progressive house is *extremely* diverse. You look at the beatport top progressive house charts, and it's all people like Afrojack and Hardwell and such. That doesn't tell the whole story. Yes, people like Avicii and Vicetone and Basto make progressive house, but some of the best of the genre comes from artists like Shingo Nakamura, Mindset, Sander Vaan Doorn and a whole host of others. Deadmau5 is a great starting point. He is the reason I began to listen to progressive house music, and probably for hundreds of thousands of others. Go! Explore this genre, because it's one of the most creative, innovative, artistic and, you guessed it, *progressive* genres in electronic music. You just have to find where the gems are. This list is only a slight sampling, but I hope you enjoy reading and listening as much I did when I first heard about a lot of these tracks."	t5_2s5of	True

It has been a long time though since I have paid any attention to the progressive house/trance genre but I have been listening to a lot of my old tunes again recently. I was hoping that some of you might be able to point me in the direction of what is hot at the moment, is there a good site where I can download/listen to full sets? I used to really be into people like Steve Lawler (all time fave), Nick Warren, John Digweed, Sasha, Saeed &amp; Palash, Danny Howells and Sander Kleinenberg. Any help people can give me so I can start getting back into it all would be much appreciated! Merry Christmas	t5_2s5of	True

I remember listening to the Magik compilations and thinking how awesome these new sounds were.  I remember a time when I came across the Jurassic Park theme music, the symphony and listening to that on repeat as a kid.  I actually sat there with my CD player and played that on repeat for 2 days straight.  As we grew older and new artists began to emerge, different styles were born.

As trance became more and more generic, Progressive House was born.  The pianos, the real instruments, the tunes, the tweaked chords, nothing can compare to this.  Its been 4 years and I havent turned back since.

As time passes, younger artists are creating these same tunes we have come to love for years.  Some of them as young as 15 years old.  This is true talent, real musicians with piano skills like Shingo Nakamura and Lessov.

About 90% of those songs ARE NOT progressive house, and anything that sounds like it isn't progressive house, either. It's pretty much trance. I hope that's not where prog house in its entirety is heading, because then it will no longer be true progressive house... it will be trance.

Edit: I want to add: Yes, I've discussed the inaccuracy of Beatport genre labeling on r/proghouse in the past, and I stated that it's not Beatport's fault because the genre is labeled by the artist/record label. This still stands. The problem I'm seeing is that artists are pretty much making slower trance and calling it ""progressive house""."	t5_2s5of	True

I mixed the first 4 tracks, she mixed the next 5, then I mixed the last 3. Overall we chose some great tracks, but my ""sound"" is a little different than hers. She loves the deep bassy tracks, and so do I, but that's not what I normally mix. I think we made it all go smoothly though. Let us know what you think!

All I know is that I love this music and I can't explain why, and I can never correctly explain it to people that don't know it. 

Anyways, to my question. What separates Proghouse from styles such as House or trance? I also tell electronic vets that I love Proghouse, and that some of Deadmau5's pieces are absolutely stunning. However I get lynched right on the spot, being told that ""Deadmau5 isn't house you idiot"". Who are some artists that correctly represent what Proghouse really is?"	t5_2s5of	True

I've been listening to Jaytech since episode 48, and I really enjoyed 49 (Shingo Nakamura), 53 (Tom Fall) and 54 (Johan Vilborg).

I've been listening to Silk Royal since 135. I like most of these, couldn't really point out ones that I LOVED.

I'll go ahead and nominate one of the most obvious candidates: Jaytech. Though his releases sometimes fall more within the bounds of progressive trance, he has experienced a massive rise in popularity. [Atlantic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDHPxuYJo1c)/[Synergy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZbda4qMt_8) was followed by the [2012 rework of Overdrive](http://soundcloud.com/jaytechmusic/jaytech-overdrive-2012-remix) (of which I am a huge fan). He released his second LP, Multiverse, featuring great tracks such as [Dr. Device](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtRSoeMsT_I), a rework of [New Vibe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp61167gwLg) and the title track [Multiverse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3SeIbPL8Gc).

He also worked on ANJUNADEEP04 with James Grant, his mix featuring tracks such as [Soundprank - Boundless Energy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW5w104GHHU) and [Suspect 44 - Neon Feel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-PAj6N2_hs)

This brings me to his monthly podcast, a fantastic source of new tracks from well-known to emerging talents, which has a reputation on this subreddit as one of the first places to go when getting into the genre.

Whilst he supports Above &amp; Beyond, and thus caters to a trancier crowd, his tour through Australia was awesome, closing his set with one of my favourite tracks [David Akermanis - Aura (G-tek Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afndcDGPalk).

I see Jaytech as the modern ambassador of progressive house, bringing the sounds we love to a wider audience. Though his tracks may be hit and miss, and fall within different genres, there's no doubt that he's had a huge year."	t5_2s5of	True

1366086918.0	1cfxvv	Why does progressive house sound so electro now?	KanyeFresh	8	3	7	"Maybe it's just me but it seems like every new progressive house track sounds the same recently. It has the same melodic, synthy buildup to an elctro-sounding, arpeggiated drop. What happened to the songs with the melodic drop like: Armin Van Buuren feat. Laura V - Drowning (Avicii Remix), Basto - Gregory's Theme Song, Kaskade feat. Mindy Gledhill - Eyes, Mark Mendes, Paris &amp; Simo - Aura etc. 
 
Every song now sounds like: Nicky Romero - Symphonica, Ummet Ozcan - Here &amp; Now, Hard Rock Sofa - Rasputin etc 

I know ""big room"" is more the subgenre I'm looking for but it seems like over the past couple years all progressive house is sounding much more electro. Any help in finding songs/artists producing a more melodic style would be greatly appreciated.

I bought two floor seats to Tiesto and Dada Life for tonight (21st) at Umass Amherst. Of course the only person who would want to go with me bailed at the last minute. Does anybody want these tickets? If yes, PM me and we can figure out a way for me to get them to you.

Honestly I just want to make back what I paid, but if you really don't want to pay me, just pay for me to ship the tickets to you same day and you can have them. Let me know guys"	t5_2s5of	True

1357884513.0	16d6lp	Why I go to live shows.	dunnowins	6	0	1	"Ok, so Shingo Nakamura is DJing live in the US tomorrow night and I posted a link about it.  A few people have messaged me asking if I was a promoter or something and so I thought I'd explain why I posted it.  I posted it because I love the guy's music.  I go to a lot of live shows though and so why do I do it?

Over the last couple years I've been to more live shows than I can count.  Trance, prog house, dubstep, electro, tech house; I've been to a lot.  I know we're all about ""support the artist"" here and so hear me out.  I pirate music.  I can tell you with certainty that in the last few years I have paid for an MP3 only once and it was in order to list myself in a raffle.  I didnt even really like the music I bought but I did like the prize.

I go to shows to support the artist.  I have upwards of 2000 tracks on my computer.  At the regular prices I see on Beatport and elsewhere I cannot afford that.  And so I download the tracks illegally.  Yes, I know this is against the law and generally I understand artists' gripes with pirating.  However, I can afford to save money over a period of time and then splurge to go see them live.

I lived in Orlando for a while and shows there RARELY cost more than $35.  I saw Prok &amp; Fitch (and quite a few others) for $10.  I can afford this.  I currently have 3 Prok &amp; Fitch tracks on my computer and have listened to some sets of theirs on Soundcloud.  I think the $10 is a fair exchange.  I own ZERO Skrillex tracks though I did pay a lot of money to go to Ultra and I did see him at a local club for around $40.

My point is that I cant afford what it costs for me to enjoy the music I like on a regular basis and so when I can I go out of my way to pay to see someone live.  They came to my town to do a live performance and I've pirated their music and so to me it is only fair that I pay the fee to go support their music.

I understand that some may think this may not be totally fair to the artist.  If I could I would purchase every track I have on my computer because I love all of them.  To me each one is worth the .99 or 1.99 or whatever it costs on different sites but I dont have that much money.  It is important (to me at least) to note that I didn't come up with this justification on my own.  A few years ago I heard a piece on NPR about a band in Brazil that flies private jets across the country to do concerts (all of which are sold out).  They do not sell any CDs.  In anticipation of a concert they distribute CDs for free to local people in the city in which they are about the perform.  As a result they make all of there money (which is considerable) from live performances.  I have this in mind every time I purchase a ticket to a live show.

If you pirate music please, please go to live shows when you can.  There are a lot of artists out there who make great stuff who are just getting barely by and some not at all."	t5_2s5of	True
