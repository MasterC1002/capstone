if you are strongly for this or against it please leave a comment, your feedback counts here.

1369156363.0	1ervwm	[Mod Post] A new direction for this subreddit		350	69	55	"**Please upvote for visibility**

-----

When this subreddit first started it was about: 

&gt; A subreddit for videos AND, for the first time ever, GIFs, of people breaking valuable things, and of reactions of people breaking valuable things.

As we have grown, we have noticed that with this idea for the subreddit, we will eventually run out of content to post here, since it's so narrow. There aren't *that* many videos/gifs of people breaking valuable things. 

So the moderators have decided to broaden the concept of this subreddit to:

&gt; Anything gone horribly wrong

A lot of the videos that are being posted here don't really have anything of value breaking, so we have to end up removing them, but we feel like they should belong. 

Some of the content on this subreddit *does* make you say ""nononono!"" even if there is nothing of value breaking. Like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nononono/comments/1er5nb/gopro_rock_climbing_fall/) video for example. 

Now I know you're probably thinking, with the subreddit that broad the quality of the content will probably go down. We will try to prevent that by adding some rules as needed. We won't let this become the next ""failblog"". For starters, we will not allow videos from ""fail"" type youtube channels or ""fail compilation"" videos. 

**This is just a trial run. If this doesn't work out or if the users of this subreddit do not like this new idea, then we will revert back to the old way.**

1375896294.0	1jw8u8	Regarding the rules...	AdvocateForLucifer	219	56	202	"It seems we need a discussion about the rules in this subreddit, given the number of posts we see get reported (and the comments in the post whichonly seem to talk about the rules it breaks).

Recently [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nononono/comments/1jvuzo/get_up_man_get_up_get_out_of_the_way/) post garnered a lot of discussion because it does involve a person being injured. At the same time, there's a feeling of impending doom which brings about the 'no... no... no...' reaction.

There are a few things which we can do. One, we can keep the rules as is, but remove the 'moderator discretion' portion. In that instance we would remove all videos + gifs which break the rules regardless of whether they have that impending doom or not.

The second option is that we remove the rule about visible injury and death. These posts would get a special flair (either NSFL, Injury, Death, or whatever else it takes to warn people who don't want to see it). This would allow people who *do* want to see that kind of thing the opportunity to see it, at the same time deterring people who don't come here to see people get injured.

The third option is that we do nothing, leave the rules as-is, and let moderator discretion decide what stays and what goes. I don't like this option, which is why I made this post.

Additionally, there are some posts here which do not show visible injury/death but also don't involve anything being broken. What are your opinions on posts like that?

**EDIT: I would appreciate if you guys didn't downvote things you disagree with. This post is purely for discussion, and there's no point in having a discussion if only one side is visible. If you're going to leave a downvote at the very least explain why you disagree with the person you're downvoting.**"	t5_2w1gn	True

I'm fine with a few that are funny or have a very expensive car involved but just a regular crash is not something that should be on this subreddit, in my opinion. Feel free to disagree. Thanks.

Edit: Hey guys, I really didn't want to cause this much trouble. I just wanted to throw a problem I thought the sub was having and see if people were feeling the same way. Thanks to MattTrobinson for taking some time and looking into the issue. I wasn't looking to be whiny or try to ""take this sub back to it's roots"", if I came off that way I apologize. 

All the best.

I've seen it dozens of times with my own eyes. Sure it's something crashing. And sometimes spectacularly. Sure they can be expensive. But to me they don't belong in this sub. A video of a model taking a dive just isn't a NO for me. It's not like a crane falling off a bridge. They don't live up to the usual content quality of this sub and if they take up much more space in this beautiful sub it will really rustle my jimmies.

Edit: The karma indicates others share my feeling about RC content, but that doesn't mean I acted on my feelings in the best way. This post isn't the worst thing of itself, but I've learned from talking with the mod that these kinds of posts are too common and very likely unnecessary. This sub has a [suggestion box](http://www.reddit.com/r/nononono/comments/16r1yu/announcement_there_has_been_alot_of_suggestions) where you can help the mods improve the sub if you have similar feelings in the future. And if you get strongly opinionated about content and feel like a downvote isn't enough, I guess I'd recommend expressing yourself in the comments of that content rather than a self post. I know many people agreed with me, but I also frustrated others as much as the content frustrated me. Clearly that is not productive for the sub community. Lesson learned."	t5_2w1gn	True

1370489765.0	1fronp	[Mod Post] Returning to the way things were and a new rule		93	20	17	"**Please upvote for visibilty**

-------
So about two weeks ago there was a [mod post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nononono/comments/1ervwm/mod_post_a_new_direction_for_this_subreddit/) that I made making a change to the direction that this subreddit was taking. 

A lot of people were displeased with this, but we decided to just go through with it for a while to see how things would turn out. Turns out a lot of people still didn't like it, so we're going back to the way things were before, as promised in the original mod post. 

So as of now, this subreddit is, once again, about:

&gt; A subreddit for videos AND, for the first time ever, GIFs, of people breaking valuable things, and of reactions of people breaking valuable things.


So any video with nothing of value breaking will be removed. This includes things that have monetary value, and sentimental value. Say someone worked really hard on something and it broke, that's allowed. 

----

**New Rule:**

A lot of people seem to dislike posts with injuries on this subreddit. (I, *personally*, don't see why and have no problems with posts with injuries here if they are properly tagged.) But we will do what the community likes. So we are including a rule against posts with ***VISIBLE*** injury or death. Notice the emphasis on visible. This means, that if there is any proof or certainty that someone was injured or killed/died in the content of a post, it will be removed, otherwise not. We won't go speculating and removing posts because that wouldn't work out well. 

If you have any comments, suggestions, or complaints, please leave a comment below! Thanks.

So I just wanted to suggest that we think twice before deep linking to the moment of destruction. Certain submissions here would gain *so* much from spending the extra 60 seconds to watch the entire video.

DeltaEks	104	50	12	"I haven't seen any text posts here yet, but I don't see anything explicitly in the rules that restricts them, so I'd like to tell you a quick story about a nononono-worthy incident that happened to me a few years ago. Please downvote this if these kinds of posts are not allowed.

About 5 or 6 years ago, my mom, my brother (Jacob), our friend (Anthony) and I were all **coming back from a relaxing, fun retreat at a nature camp** somewhere in the mountains near Santa Cruz, California. My mom was **driving** us **on the freeway**, I was in the front seat and Jacob and Anthony were in the back seats **playing** a multiplayer game of **Mario Party DS. I had let Anthony borrow my DS** to connect to my brother's DS (in Mario Party you only need 1 game cartridge to play a multiplayer game; the cartridge was in Jacob's DS).

As most of you probably know, Mario Party consists of many silly and gimmicky mini-games you can play to gain a lead against your opponent. **There are some mini-games that require you to blow into the microphone**, one of these games just happened to be chosen. Right before the game starts, Jacob gets a *super smart* idea to use the wind coming from the car window as a lazy substitute for the blowing, and cautiously holds his DS close enough to the window to get a good torrent of air pummeling onto the microphone. **Anthony**, sees him, and quickly counteracts by rolling down his own window and **sticking my whole freaking DS outside the car holding it with one flimsy hand straight into the 70 mph winds**. Not surprisingly, **my DS goes flying.**

My reaction: up to this point being oblivious to what's happening behind me, I hear Anthony let out a gasp and continue to speak spurts of panic-talk. I glance back at my brother who's staring in shock. I slowly start to put together the pieces and burst out in regretful rage. It was a very tense rest of the drive. Still to this day I wonder where all the pieces went... and how tragically my DS shattered on the ground, and what the people behind us were thinking.

Anthony ended up paying me for my losses, and I got a brand new DS... which I barely played at all after that incident.

Some users have brought up some concerns regarding posts with death/gore/injuries in this subreddit. We had some confusion on our sidebar, we have since taken care of that. 

Please see rule 6 (the last rule) on the side bar:

&gt; **All posts containing death must be marked as nsfw.**

Posts containing death/gore/injuries **are allowed as long as they are properly tagged.** You can still have expensive stuff breaking and people getting injured in the process. In a lot of the car crash and motorcycle crash videos on this subreddit some of the drivers probably got injured without a doubt. So if you do not wish to view these types of submissions, just steer clear of the NSFW posts. If a post is really really gorey or disturbing we will label it accordingly. 

If you see any posts that should be labeled as NSFW but are not, please send the mods a message with a link to the posts asking for it to be labeled as NSFW. 

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding this or anything else, please leave a comment!

Should the subreddit be *just* about reaction videos?

With this volume of submissions, there will be a point where original content will stop being posted. So, to ward off this point, I am taking a poll:

Would you like the subreddit to change from
&gt;A subreddit for videos AND, for the first time ever, GIFs, of people's reactions to breaking valuable things.

or

&gt;A subreddit for videos AND, for the first time ever, GIFs, of people breaking valuable things.

?

**EDIT: POLL CLOSES IN ~ONE HOUR (8 pm Central GMT-5)**

**EDIT 2 THE RETURN OF THE EDIT: Due to overwhelming support for the change as of 8pm 14/1/2013, this subreddit is now going to be:**

&gt;A subreddit for videos AND, for the first time ever, GIFs, of people breaking valuable things, and of reactions  of people breaking valuable things.

Thank you for participating

In close conjunction with r/cringe, r/wince does not devote itself to embarrassing or awkward situations in which you feel sorry for the persons involved. It is more about material that makes you ""wince"", seeing uncomfortable videos or pictures that you struggle to view until the end. Indeed, it is similar, but I can guarantee that it is a whole new level, or *type* of cringe. I'm sure you'll all appreciate it, however if you're up to the task, here's a direct link:

In order to maintain the independent integrity of this subreddit I think we should move away from car related content. Half the cars being broken are not even particularly valuable but they still get upvoted to the front.

I can currently see two posts that fit this criteria currently on the ""hot"" page for this sub.

Everything else is crashes, explosions, car pile-ups, fires etc.

Go and look at the top 4 posts here of all time to see what the subreddit should be about:

 - [Ice sculptor's finishing touch ruins entire masterpiece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stbVH1C-IT0)

 - [Religious statue smashes into smithereens during church procession](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Ian6oV5RQ)

 - [I actually have just the thing for this (one of a kind item breaks live on TV)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsL6wNP_oJo)

 - [Inexperienced driver panicking about wrecking their parents' car](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dsTiPhcaeus)

Perhaps you are reading this and you disagree.

**Please explain why you disagree before you downvote**.

Maybe the purpose of this subreddit has changed, in which case it is no longer the interesting, unique subreddit that it once was. That would be a shame.

_______

EDIT: So after reading the comments so far, perhaps a subreddit redefinition is in order? Videos in which there is a clear moment where something starts to go wrong, but there is nothing that can be done, with an emphasis on expensive things breaking rather than people get injured and cars crashing."	t5_2w1gn	True
