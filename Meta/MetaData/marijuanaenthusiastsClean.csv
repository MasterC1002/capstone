In a year, an acre of trees captures 30,000 pounds of carbon dioxyde and will release over 22,000 pounds of oxygen per year? The trees are saving us from our own pollution, they are used to build buildings and furniture, and help keep our fireplaces going during the winter.

Also around the same time I noticed a bright green fungus/lichen growing in spots on trees of all sorts. On the first year I noted it in a certain area off the northern side of the highway, on a route that I take daily.

The next year I noted it had moved south, affecting trees a half mile further down the road. By last year this green fungus/lichen was everywhere. I wonder if the green fungus/lichen is somehow connected to the whitening of the sycamores?"	t5_2uzej	True

Rocksteady2R	7	0	3	"I've done some modest research, and have a handful of questions that stem from it. I plan on hanging some fairly dynamic, fairly heavy loads from this board, so i want to be right.  My trees are both about a foot in diameter, one is a pine, the other is a tree. (not really sure what that one is).  they are about 6-8 feet apart, and are quite healthy.

* a lot of the sources say not to put 2 holes one above the other.  this leaves me wondering how much lateral and vertical shift i must allow to keep the tree healthy?  I've been plotting 2 lags per tree.

* What product should I be looking to put in the holes of the tree (between drilling and lagging them in)?  I've only gotten vague anecdotal advice on this.  I'm sure there must be a product that will help prevent rot, water intrusion, bug infestation and whatnot once i scar up the tree.

* Once I do this, can I ever take the board and lags out w/o causing more harm to the trees?

*  Can you think of anything else I might be missing that I should consider before I do this?

* if this is the wrong sub, where can I go?

Planted 77 of them, within a week almost all had buds, within 10 days some were getting leaves, and now a month later 69 have leaves and are looking like little trees. They all started about knee high and now most of them are about waist high. There is your background info.

Live just outside of Fargo, ND. Nice black dirt with clay below it, house is on old farm land so I have no idea how deep the clay is but when I dug the footings for my deck I was still at black dirt/clay mix 5 feet down. Water the trees every other evening straight from the hose. When it has been below 75* I give them 30 seconds of water each (3 gallons), above 75 they get 45 seconds (4.5 gallons). It has been pretty hot and dry here for the last month. On days where it gets above 90-95 they get watered every evening for 45 seconds each.

The trees have been looking great up until this week. Now all of a sudden I am getting purpleish leaves. The existing leaves are lush and green-not thin, not drying out. The new leaves coming in are coming in purple and staying purple. Am I overwatering, underwatering, soil issue, temperature issue? Should I even be worried about this?

It gets these whitish pink hollow flowers once a year.  They don't last long, and the best I could do was an awful set of pictures at night. My apologies.

The leaves and branches will be much easier to see, hopefully they're of some help.

The bark is mostly smooth, seems to be quite a resilient little fucker. Or big, I suppose. It's probably 18' high and about 25' across at the center.

Got an email saying the company was having a tree sale with [this link](http://store.sequoiatrees.com/prostores/servlet/Page?template=specials%20blank) in the email.  Figured /r/MarijuanaEnthusiasts might be interested in new and/or interesting trees.

Does anyone else have a reputable supplier you've used with success?

It looks like the oranging is starting at the top of the tree and spreading down the branches. No needles are falling off, yet, but we really don't want our trees to die! Can anyone help?
