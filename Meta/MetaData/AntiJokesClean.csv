The man knows damn well it is impossible for such a large building to be contained inside him, but he grits his teeth and forces his ass open wider. His ribs break, his lungs collapse, and his now lifeless body is stretched into the shape of the bar. 

The bar is almost entirely consumed before the man's skin gives way to the bulging pressure...with an explosion of blood &amp; organs, the shredded remains of the man are slung-shot around the lot where the bar formerly stood. 

The bar, now soaked in a mixture of blood &amp; organ fluid, reflects upon the failure of its experiment. For the next attempt, a man of far greater fortitude must be used, so that his body does not burst so easily. 

Only then will it achieve its dream of becoming the first bar to walk into a man."	t5_2r37g	True

At the restaurant, the boy and the girl had to wait in a line much longer than the line at the cafeteria. They became closer from this, laughing about how often they spend their time waiting in lines. Finally they are seated and enjoy their meal. 

A month later, the couple go to the school prom, ironically the boy had to wait in a 30 minutes in a line for the flowers, 45 minutes in a line for the tux, and an hour in the bathroom! Tired from all of this waiting in lines, he is excited to spend some time with the girl at the dance.

Many people go to this school, so the line to get into prom was long itself, which really didn't bother the couple, since they were so used to the long lines anyway, they made it fun.

Finally after all this time the couple are at the prom and begin dancing the night away. After a while, the two are very tired from dancing, and sit down for a little bit to take a break. ""Could you go get us something to drink, please?"" says the girl. The boy gets up, walks to the concession stand, and there was no punchline."	t5_2r37g	True

1355693817.0	14yin3	Man and a Clown (long but worth it)	SkaiiNyght	362	54	79	"As a child Sam was as happy as could be; playing with sticks, climbing trees, all that good shit. One day for his sixth birthday his parents decided to take him to the circus. Little Sam was so excited he could not stop bouncing in his seat in the car, nor could he stand still in line whilst his parents purchased their tickets.


Sam and his parents find their seats and wait for the circus to commence(the waiting nearly killed Sam). Finally the circus starts; the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, and finally towards the end of the show the clowns come out. This is what Sam has been waiting for all night (he loves to laugh).


The clowns go through their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, etc.. All of the clowns but one leave the center ring. This clown turns on a microphone he is given by the ring master and says, ""Ladies and Gentleman! For your last laugh of the evening I will need a volunteer!"" Little Sam, not knowing what this was all about, was the only one who did not raise his hand.


The Clown makes a spectacle of choosing his volunteer, and finally the spot light lands on little Sam. He looks to his parents questioningly and they wave him down. After he makes his way down the aisle and into the center ring.


The clown asks, ""What is your name little boy?""

""S-sam."" he replies.

""Well S-sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?""

""N-no?""

""Well little Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?""

""No.""

""Well you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd goes wild with laughter, rofl barely covers it. All the while this is happening little Sam is mortified to be laughed at by so many people and starts crying right there in the center ring which, much to his dismay, made everyone laugh all the harder. He makes his way back to his parents and they take him home all the way attempting to make him feel better.


---~10 Years Later---


Little Sam is no longer so little, he is now a Sophmore in high-school. Albeit a little awkward, tonight he is taking out a girl for their very first date. Now this girl not only is completely out of his league, but she is a very popular girl. He has done his research and found out that she is dying to go see the circus.


On their way to the circus he is so excited he is almost bouncing in his seat, of course he doesn't because that would be completely uncool of him. As they are standing in line to get their tickets, he can hardly stand still, he is definitely hoping to get some hand holding action tonight!


They take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts, which also happens to be when everyone begins to applaud.
He cannot truly enjoy circus because the entire time he is still trying to touch her hand. He can tell by her reactions the trapeze artists were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget being shot out of a cannon was exhilarating. Finally the clowns come out.


This is when Sam finally begins to pay attention, he is searching for a clown he has seen 10 years ago that scarred him.


*NO SHIT!* - he thinks to himself - *THAT CAN'T BE THE SAME CLOWN!* (It was)


The clowns do their usual routine, pies to the face, falling down on purpose, hitting other clowns over the head. Towards the end of the act all of the clown leave the center ring except one. *The same fucking clown, god damn-it!*


The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master


""Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy for the evening I will need a volunteer!""


*Like hell I'm going to volunteer* Sam thinks to himself, yet in doing this he is the only person not raising his hand. The clown again makes a spectacle of choosing volunteer. Finally the spotlight stops on not so little Sam.


Wide-eyed Sam looks over to his date and she has a brilliant smile on her face and urges him to go down after a quick kiss on the cheek. After this moment Sam is in a daze *my first kiss, oh my god, it was amazing*. The next thing he knows he is standing before the clown in the center ring.


""What is your name young man?""

*I hope its not the same lame ass joke* ""My name is Sam.""

""Well Sam, are you the front end of a jack-ass?""

*Really? Again?* Reluctantly Sam says, ""No.""

""Well Sam, are you the back end of a jack-ass?""

""Ugh No.""

""Well then Sam, you must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd completely goes wild, rotflmfao barely covers it. He looks into the seats where he and his date were sitting and she is laughing just as hard as everyone else. For some reason that Sam cannot explain to this very day he broke down crying, this time in front of everyone and his date, which makes the crowd laugh even harder.
This day Sam swears his revenge on this god-awful clown.


---~10 Years Later---


Big Sam is now 26 years old with a family of his own; a wife of 5 years, two beautiful children, a dog, all that good shit.


For vacation Sam decides to take his family on a cruise ship. Big Sam is bouncing in his seat (he doesn't have to be cool anymore), his children are as well. As they wait to board the ship Sam can hardly stand still *Open Bar! Free Child Care! Free Massage!*. As he is handed a list of events from the person overseeing the boarding he notices there is even a circus on this cruise. *No way, what would the odds be?*


They enjoy their cruise, and on the last night Sam brings his family to the circus. They get their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills his children). The lights finally go down and it begins. The trapeze were great, the lion tamers stunned, the midget getting shot out of a cannon was riveting, the motorcycles that go around in a sphere nearly took their breath away, finally the clowns come out.


*Ok you mother fucking clown where are you at? Where, oh where can you--AHA!* Sam spots the clown that has caused him so much pain in the past which is great for him because he has come up with the perfect response to this clown.


The clowns do their usual routine; pies to the face, falling down, hitting others over the head with hammers, spraying others with water jet flowers. Towards the end of the act all of the clowns except one leave the center ring.


*Show time!*


The clown turns on a microphone that he is given from the ring master.


""Ladies and Gentlemen! For your last bit of comedy tonight I will need a volunteer!""

*If I don't raise my hand you're going to pick me. I know your game clown!*

As usual big Sam is the only one that does not raise his hand. The clown makes a big spectacle of choosing his volunteer. Finally the spotlight lands on big Sam.


*Now its my turn!*


Before he knows it Sam is down in front of the clown with a smug smile on his face.


""Well sir, what would your name be?""

""My name would be Sam"", he replies with a confidence that makes the clown a little uneasy.

""Well Sam, are you the front-end of a jack-ass?""

""No, not I am not the front-end of a jack-ass."", he answers as smugly as he can manage. He is now bubbling with anticipation.

""Yes, well then, are you the back-end of a jack-ass?""

""Ha no, no I am not.""

""Well Sam, You must be **NO** end of a jack-ass!""


The crowd goes wild, little old ladies have heart attacks, ICU hardly covers it.
Sam grabs the microphone from the clown, and the crowd immediately quiets down.
Sam looks the clown straight in the face and says, ""Fuck you."""	t5_2r37g	True

1360955464.0	18lfdf	What did the pastor say to the rabbi?	CylonbabyLiam	331	58	21	"""GET DOWN!"" and then pulled the rabbi down to the ground, so as to avoid bullet fire. Yes, things were tough during those times, when the people of that ravaged city had to band together to defend themselves and their neighbors. Years later, the priest and the rabbi would invite one another to family dinners, and over ample glasses of wine, as their children played in front of the fire, they would discuss the political events that led up to such vicious tragedies, thankful that they were able to survive and prosper.

Of course, as time takes its toll, the pastor eventually passed away and the rabbi, very old, but still loving of his comrade, spoke at his funeral. It was a strange experience to see all the people gathered around him, whom the pastor had known, whom the rabbi now knew as well. He felt satisfied to be an old man with such a meaningful, long friendship that had opened up his family and included so many more, whom he may have never met if it weren't for that pastor.

Eventually ,the rabbi passed away, and his funeral was equally as attended, and both men's good will and spirit was passed down through the generations of their family. In reality, that conflict was just a blip in the course of human history; a long forgotten moment in time where tragedy, just for a second, reared its ugly head and grabbed hold of the human spirit. But the rabbi and the pastor's friendship was a testament to humanity's ability to find connections even in the worst of times. On Mars, eventually, the pastor's descendants would erect a statue of the two men, for their courage represented the tolerance and kindness of the new generation that had come forth after such a brutal conflict.

With the advent of the EM drive, humanity prospered and spread among the stars, with the rabbi and pastor's progeny being counted among the many brave explorers who discovered thousands of new worlds. Many of their children's children did not believe the same things as their forefathers, and in fact some did not believe at all, but they were still valued members of their community, and their family names lived on as respected icons of accomplishment."	t5_2r37g	True

""Well,"" the gentleman replies, ""it's a really funny story actually. One day I was walking through town minding my own business and this Genie pops up out of nowhere, and says I can have three wishes. So I thought about it for a while, and for my first wish I asked for $100 million.  The Genie then snapped his fingers and told me to go and check my bank account and then disappeared. So I went and checked it, and lo and behold there it was just over $100 million in my account.  Then the Genie pops up again and says ""What is your 2nd wish?"" Not being a very big hit with the ladies, I decided to ask for 10 women on call at any hour of the day to fulfil my every sexual need. ""Done"" says the Genie, and disappears into thin air.  When I got home I was greeted by 10 beautiful women who immediately ripped my clothes off and begin to pleasure me in ways I never imagined.  Later on that day the Genie pops up once again and says, ""Right, only one more wish left, what will it be?""  Realizing this was my last wish, I thought long and hard... and after 20 minutes of silence I said, ""Can I have an orange for a head?""

They head out into the woods, and before long, the hunter sees a figure at the top of a distant ridge. He raises his gun and aims.

His entourage, seeing that it's a man, tells him ""Don't shoot, it's not a moose!""

Still, the man sets his sights and chambers a shell.

When they reach the dying man on the ridge, a member in his entourage asks, ""Why did you shoot? We told you it wasn't a moose.""

""Ohhh,"" the man says. ""I thought you said it WAS a moose.""

Tuning the radio to NPR, the man slowly peels some of the greasy excess skin of the hormone-infused poultry product and contemplates his life as a bachelor.

The usual signs… Phone rings but if I answer, the caller hangs up.

My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when I ask their names she always says, “Just some friends from work, you don’t know them.”



I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home, but she always walks down the drive. Although I can hear a car driving off, as if she has gotten out of the car round the corner. Why? Maybe she wasn’t in a taxi?



I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.



Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my wife I think deep down I just didn’t want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her.



I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she came home. It was at that moment, crouching behind my bike , that I noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a little oil.



Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?

He answers it, and there stands a Brit looking slightly anxious and completely drenched from the rain. The Brit speaks

""I'm terribly sorry, but I've just arrived in your country and I'm dreadfully lost. I stumbled upon your house and thought it looked simply breathtaking. I was wondering if you might let me stay here for the night seeing as it's dark out and I don't know where I'm going.""

The American replies, ""Absolutely, it would be nice to have some company around here for a change."" And invites the man in.

The two men have a few drinks, get acquainted and before long it comes time to go to bed. The American says ""there are two bedrooms on each floor of my house, I'm going to sleep in one of the ones on the third floor, would you like to sleep in the other?"" The Brit says that sounds fine and the two men retire to their rooms for the night.

The American is peacefully sleeping away until, at 3am, the Brit runs into the his room, shakes him violently and yells ""There's a fire in my room! Hurry, we have to get out of here!"" 

The American wakes up, and sure enough the other room is on fire. They run downstairs and call the fire dept. who come and put out the fire. 

When things have died down a little, the American begins to think ""Hmmm.. That's strange. I've never had a fire before. Isn't it bizarre that it happens the first night I have this visitor. Oh well, we were both drinking a fair bit, maybe I just left an appliance on accidentally in my haze."" He tells the Brit not to worry about it, ""these things happen"" and sends him on his way.

The next night, the American is once again sitting alone watching TV when again he hears a knock on the door. He goes to answer it, and again sees the Brit there. The Brit asks if he can stay there again since he had such a pleasant time the night before. The American complies, saying ""Certainly, it was a shame about the fire, but it was nice to have the company."" 

The two men again have a few drinks, then to decide to go to bed, this time in the second storey bedrooms (as the third storey ones had burnt down). The American is sound asleep until, again, at 3am, the Brit wakes him up, frantically yelling about a fire in his room. They flee, call the fire dept. who again put out the fire. This time the American is very suspicious of the Brit, but since he doesn't have any solid evidence he again says ""these things happen"" and sends the Brit on his way.

The third night, the Brit returns again asking to stay for the night. The American invites him in and again they commence drinking merrily until it comes time to go to bed (on the first floor). They each go to their bedrooms, but the American decides he wants to catch the Brit red-handed so he sets an alarm for 2:59am. 

He sleeps away until 2:59 rolls around and he's woken up by his alarm. He storms into the other room where he sees, not to his surprise, the Brit lighting a match and setting fire to his curtains. 

He proclaims ""AH HAH! So you *are* the one starting all of these fires!""

And the Brit replies

1358200182.0	16kqag	Searched, but didn't see my favourite anti-joke anywhere here	shiningmidnight	189	30	98	"I was told this in high school by a good friend of mine. It is  supposed to be the longest joke in the world. It's going to be **very very** long. Just did a word count online: 2800 words. You've been warned.

There once was a bright kingdom, with a great King, it a very large castle. He had a beautiful daughter, who all of the Knights wished to marry. When she came of age, many Knights asked for her hand. The King, being a great King, allowed her to choose her own suitor. But one by one, all of the knights were turned down.

One day a young, young squire ran to the castle. He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""It is I, the King's squire, here to deliver unto him an important message,"" said the squire.

""And what is the message?"" one asked.

""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" both guards gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the squire ran to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.

""Who goes there?"" asked the Herald.

""It is I,"" said the squire, ""the King's squire. I have for him a message.""

""And it is?"" asked the Herald.

""""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the herald gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.

""Announcing the King's squire, travelling to give the King an important message!""

The squire scurried into the room and kneeled before the great King.

""Speak!"" bellowed the King.

""It is I, your squire, my Lord. I am here to deliver unto you an important message,"" said the squire.

""Get on with it already,"" said the King.

""My liege. The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the King gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

Just then there was a ruckus at the drawbridge. Faintly, the king could hear the guardsmen shouting something.

Distantly, the sound of the drawbridge lowering cut through the air. 

Through the door the King heard the Herald.

""Halt! What business have you with the King?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" gasped the Herald.

""Yes, the Black Black Knight,"" he said, ""Now get out of my way before I kill you.""

The door was kicked open and a seven-foot tall man clad in armour blacker than the moonless night sky strode before the great King. He didn't bother kneeling.

""Insolence!"" cried the King, ""What business have you here?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, and I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage.""

""No, not the Black Black Knight,"" gasped the King.

""Yes, the Black Black Knight,"" he said, ""now let me see your daughter before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the great King. ""She is at the top of the longest staircase in the tallest tower, guarded by a magical portrait.""

So the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. 

""State your business with the Princess,"" said the portrait.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the portrait gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.

As he stepped through, the Princess, shocked, screeched and backed against the wall.

""Who are you, and how did you get in here?!"" she cried.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to ask for the your hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" she gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now, give me an answer.""

""Well,"" said the Princess, obviously distraught. ""I've never met you nor do I know if the tales about you are true. I believe a husband should be strong, and brave and able to protect me from anything. And I need proof. Go to the Red Mountain of the South, defeat the ruby red dragon and bring me back a ruby red dragon scale.""

""Fine, I shall fetch you your trinket. And then you will give me an answer,"" said the Black Black Knight.

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the base of the Red Mountain of the South.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed it was incredibly hot. Gouts of flame shot from the ground, and from fissures in the walls.

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the ruby red dragon, and bring a ruby red scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for a whole day. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the ruby red dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's neck. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight here to deliver the Princess her trinket,"" said the Black Black Knight.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" both guards gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.

So the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered, and the Black Black Knight walked to the throne room. The drawbridge clacked shut behind him. At the door he was stopped by the Herald.

""Who goes there?"" asked the Herald.

""It is I,"" said the Knight, ""the Black Black Knight. I have the princess' trinket.""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the herald gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

So the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.

""Announcing the Black Black Knight, he who rode to the Red Mountain of the South and defeated the ruby red drag on has come bearing its scale for the Princess!""

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the King gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" the Knight confirmed. ""Now let me see the Princess before I kill you.""

So the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, after a day's march, he came to a magical, moving portrait. 

""State your business with the Princess,"" said the portrait.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Red Mountain of the South, defeated the ruby red dragon, and I am here to deliver its ruby red scale, that I may earn the Princess' hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

""Fine,"" said the portrait, and swung aside revealing a doorway.

He stepped inside and the Princess turned to see him.

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have ridden to the Red Mountain of the South, defeated the ruby red dragon, and I am here to deliver its ruby red scale, that I may earn your hand in marriage,"" he said.

""So you fought it and killed it in fair battle, did you?"" she asked.

""I did,"" said the Black Black Knight.

""Well,"" said the Princess. ""It's impressive, but I thought the scale would be bigger. It couldn't have been too hard. I don't know if I can trust you to protect me. Go, ride to the Blue Cave of the North, do battle with the sapphire blue dragon, and bring me a sapphire blue scale. Only then will I know you're worthy.""

""Fine,"" said the Black Black Knight, ""and then you will give me an answer.""

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the mouth of the Blue Cave of the North.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he finally found a hidden cave entrance. He went inside and noticed that the walls and floor were all very icy and slippery. His armour was forming frost just by being there. 

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the sapphire blue dragon, and bring a sapphire blue scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for two whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the sapphire blue dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt, who goes there?"" asked the guards in unison.

""Fine,"" said the Black Black Knight, ""and then you will give me an answer.""

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the edge of the Emerald Forest of the East.

He looked around for days, then weeks, until he found a barely used path that wound through the forest for a very long time. He looked around and noticed everything was dense and overgrown. 

""Sssssstop,"" said a booming, serpentine voice, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, the Black Black Knight, I have come to slay the emerald green dragon, and bring a emerald green scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for three whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the emerald green dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom, riding for days and days and days without rest.

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

I've conquered the ruby red dragon of the Red Mountain of the South, the sapphire blue dragon of the Blue Cave of the North, and the emerald green dragon of the Emerald Forest of the East. I have brought you scales from each of the slain beasts. Will you marry me now?""

1342194967.0	wi5ar	How do you catch a polar bear?	selfabortion	190	30	20	"First, one must determine a reasonable location in which to expect polar bears to be lurking.  They are generally found in Arctic regions.  Second, you'll need to distribute a number of well-camouflaged bear traps, such as the one [pictured here](http://chanteepps.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bear-trap.jpg) in areas that one might expect polar bears to be searching for food.  Since they are carnivores, one can expect them [primarily at the interface between ice, water, and air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear#Hunting_and_diet).  This will pose a challenge to some, but it can be done.  

The next crucial step is to monitor the traps from a safe distance, as these bears can be quite dangerous.  Additionally, should you luck out and snare one, caution should be taken not to allow enough time to pass that the bear either starves or gnaws its leg off in order to escape.  It would be prudent to shoot the animal with a tranquilizer potent enough to render it safely unconscious without risking a fatal overdose.  

It is crucial to keep in mind that the polar bear is an apex predator, meaning they have no natural prey and they play a role in keeping their own prey in check from a population standpoint; any drastic shift in the predator/prey dynamic can have unintended consequences upon the environment and negative effects on other species, as well as the indigenous peoples who hunt them.  

Finally, it should be noted that polar bears are considered a threatened species under the [Endangered Species Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species_Act) and, as such, you may be breaking the law by attempting to trap or kill such an animal.  Violations of this law could result in steep penalties for the person in question, and trapping of polar bears should therefore be avoided entirely, for legal reasons if not ethical ones.

Edit 1: April 2. Despite this thread's proximity to April Fool's Day, OP is no closer to creating a punchline for the joke setup within the title.

Edit 2: April 3. After careful examination and much soul searching, I have come to the conclusion that there still is no punchline available.

Edit 3: April 4. Aha! I thought of a great punchline. I'll tell you all tomorrow.

Edit 4: April 5. It wasn't that great of a punchline. I've decided not to share it.

Edit 5: April 6. I fear that, should I create a punchline to this anti-joke, it would become a joke and instantly annihilate itself.

Edit 6: April 7. At the pace of an edit a day, the edit will always be one number behind the date.

Edit 7: April 8. Well yes, yes. I know about the end of the month. Everyone knows about the end of the month. I wasn't talking about that.

1362766484.0	19x9yf	Pink Bicycle (warning: wall of text anti-joke)	avenlanzer	123	27	19	"For his sixth birthday a father gave his son a pink bicycle. The son was confused and asked his father why it was pink. The father just looked at the son and said ""I'll tell you when you're older"". The kid asked again, as kids are wont to do ""I'm older now, can you tell me?"" The reply was as expected ""No son, I mean really older, now go ride your bike."" So the son did go ride the bike anyway, even though it was pink and he got a bit of flak from his friends for it. After a few days he hid the bike in the back of the garage, told his dad it had been stolen by a bully and promptly forgot about it. Until his next birthday. This time he got a video game from his father and all was alright, but it brought up the question again. ""Dad? Why did you get me a pink bicycle last year for my birthday?"" The dad got a little upset and spewed the same old line ""I'll tell you when you're older."" This same scene played out on the eighth birthday as it brought back the memory of the pink bicycle. And again on the ninth and so on until the son moved out for college and he rarely returned for his birthdays. Occasionally he'd remember the pink bicycle and be reminiscent and still often confused as to why his father gave him a pink bicycle, but never quite found the time to call him up and ask something that was now so trivial. Years pass, the son grows up and has a wonderful life and as time often does it wears on the years of age and the father gets old and ill, on his deathbed. The son is having to prepare his old childhood home for the father's eventual passing, so is having a garage sale. He comes across the pink bike in the back of the garage. Laughing to himself, he decides not to sell it, but it does bring back the old question, so later that day while visiting his father in the hospital he asks. ""Father, it's been forty years. I'm sufficiently old enough now. Will you finally tell me the question that's plagued me my entire life? Why, on my sixth birthday, did you get me a pink bicycle?"" The father, laughing a bit, simply nods and smiles with joy at his son. He agrees, it's finally time to explain. ""Son. You know I love you very much. You know I'm quite proud of you and all you've done with your life. I told you when you were six that I'd tell you when you're older."" he wheezes with his bad lung, the pause causes some anxiety with the son giving just the proper dramatic effect. ""The reason son,"" he coughs, ""the reason I got you a pink bicycle when you were six--"" The father coughs again. Pausing to catch his breath, but he can't catch it. He stops breathing and the doctors and nurses all rush in to try to save him. It is to no avail and the father dies there in the hospital. The son makes the final arrangements, goes back home to stare at the pink bicycle he'd rescued from the back of his father's old garage. He never found out why his father had given it to him.

Little Jimmy is five years old and he just got a new tricycle for his birthday. One day he is riding it down the road when it starts to pour down rain. Then he hears a voice, ""Come to the treehouse, Jimmy. Come to the treehouse."" Because Jimmy doesn't understand the concept of stranger danger, he goes to the nearest treehouse. When he gets there he finds a Monk and Jimmy is invited to spend the night. At exactly 12 o' clock midnight he hears a screaming noise so he goes up to the Monk and asks ""What was that?"" The monk replied ""I'd tell you, but you're not a Monk."" Little Jimmy goes back home in the morning. 

Three years later, little Jimmy is eight years old and just got a new bicycle for his birthday. He's riding it down the road one day when it starts to pour down rain. Then he hears a voice, ""Come to the treehouse, Jimmy. Come to the treehouse."" Jimmy knows that the last time he went to the treehouse nothing bad happened, so he went to the nearest treehouse. When he gets there he finds a Monk and Jimmy is invited to spend the night. At exactly 12 o' clock midnight he hears a screaming noise so he goes up to the Monk and asks ""What was that?"" The monk replied ""I'd tell you, but you're not a Monk."" Little Jimmy goes back home in the morning. 

Eight years later, little Jimmy isn't so little anymore. He just got his license and a used car. He's driving the car down the road one day, when the car breaks down. As he's trying to fix it, it starts to pour down rain. Then he hears the voice ""Come to treehouse, Jimmy. Come to the treehouse."" Jimmy and the Monk have become good friends over the years, so he goes to the treehouse. When he gets there he finds a Monk and Jimmy is invited to spend the night. At exactly 12 o' clock midnight he hears a screaming noise so he goes up to the Monk and asks ""What was that?"" The monk replied ""I'd tell you, but you're not a Monk."" ""How do I become a Monk?"" Jimmy replies. ""It's simple."" Says the Monk as he hands Jimmy an old, twenty pound book. ""You must read this entire book, cover to cover. Once you have read it, come to me and I shall test you. Only then shall you become a monk."" Jimmy thanks the monk and takes the book home. 

When Jimmy finishes the book he's in his late 40's. he goes back to the treehouse to find the old monk. ""I read the book!"" Jimmy says. The monk then tests  Jimmy to become a monk. Later that evening the Monk says ""Jimmy, you have passed. You're now a monk."" ""So how do I know what the screaming noise is?"" Jimmy replies. ""You shall go to the nearest Walmart, go thought the employees only door, down the stairs and then you'll see a door labeled 'MONKS ONLY'. At exactly 12 o' clock midnight you shall open the door. Only then, will you finally know. 

Jimmy thanks the monk and drives to the nearest Walmart. He walks around and finds the employees only door. He looks around and finds the staircase. He walks down the stairs and sees a door labeled MONKS ONLY. At exactly 12 o' clock midnight, he open the door. Now, do you want to know what the screaming noise was?

I know this is a lot to take in right now, but there is hope. There has been a multitude of advancements in treating and managing obesity, but it will take hard work and dedication; it's not going to be a walk in the park. But we are fighting for your life...you are fighting for life. 


With that all stated, I am going to start you on a regiment of Orlistat, a twice daily tablet whose primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from one's diet, thereby reducing caloric intake. This coupled with proper diet and exercise will help you reach a healthy BMI. But please be cogniscent that there is a minuscule likelihood of heart-related side effects. So, if you are experiencing any chest pains, racing pulse etc., stop taking the pills and see me as soon as possible.

There, among the vicious sight of the countless settler wagons burning in the dusty plains, they stood, eerily proud of their folly. They knew the shame that such an unprovoked attack would bring from their tribal elders. Even still, they did not care- victory was upon them.

1339929950.0	v6b5t	The Blue Joke	ThatCricketGuy	95	21	6	"A man was driving along a deserted country road, there's thick scrub either side and he's doing about 110km/h. All of a sudden, the scrub clears up ahead and he's confronted by the strangest thing he has ever seen - off to the left is a big, blue house. 

The blue house is surrounded by blue trees, blue grass and has a blue fence. Overawed by the sight of all this blue, and questioning his own sanity, the man failed to notice the bend coming up and crashed off the road, into a ditch. 

Seeing as apart from this house, he's in the middle of nowhere with no mobile reception, he figures he has no other choice but to go up to this creepy blue house. He walks through the blue gate, up the blue driveway and knocks on the blue door. 

An elderly lady, wearing a blue dress, blue slippers and blue earrings opens the door, ""Hello.."" she said.

""Hi madam, I've just crashed my car across the road, and I wondered if I could come in and call the towing company. I really hope you don't mind."" 

""Oh, of course"" she replied, ""the phone's this way.""

The man walked through the blue door, into the blue kitchen - noting the blue tiled floor, blue fridge and blue cupboards, and picks up the blue phone. Not wanting to offend the kind lady, he does not question the obsession with blue. While on the phone to the towing company, he discovers that a tow truck cannot be sent until the following morning. He relays this news to the lady, and she offers him a room to stay in overnight.

The man walked up the blue stairs, through another blue door into the spare bedroom. He lies down on the blue bed, under the blue bedspread, and drifts off to sleep looking at the blue ceiling.

A few minutes later, another man is driving along the same country road. He too, is overawed by the blue estate confronting him, and, despite noticing the turn, cannot control his car and careers off into the same ditch. He walks up to the blue house, speaks to the lady dressed in blue and calls the same towing company with the same blue phone. He is given the same news as the previous man, and is offered a room by the old lady.

He walks into his blue bedroom, walking across the blue carpet, tossing his keys on the blue side table and drifting off to sleep in his blue bed.

Meanwhile, a third gentlemen is driving down the road, and, noting the two cars in a ditch, drives far more carefully. However, he is incredibly fatigued and has a microsleep at the wheel, causing his car to run off the road into a tree, and down an embankment. He is fine, as is the car, however he will require the services of the tow truck too. He walks back up, and notices the big blue house. After deep consideration to ascertain whether he had suffered a mild brain injury or not (despite the low speed and glancing impact of the crash), he decides approaching the blue gate, to walk up to the blue door is the best option.

He uses the blue knocker, and the kindly old lady, still dressed in her blue outfit, opens the door. 

""Can I guess"" she begins ""you've crashed your car and need to call the repairman?""

The man says yes, and goes inside, along the blue hallway, into the blue kitchen with a blue phone, blue MixMaster and blue microwave oven. 

""He won't be here until morning, the other two gentlemen have already called. I know how it sounds though, an old lady in the middle of nowhere offering you a place to stay overnight - call the company, their frustration doesn't outweigh your peace of mind.""

He calls the towing company, and they confirm the veracity of the lady's comments. He walks up the blue stairs, having already consumed a glass of water from a blue glass, and enters the third blue spare room. He collapses on the blue bed, staring up at the blue ceiling, and, fatigued from his drive, promptly falls asleep.

In the morning, each of the three men walk downstairs, exchange pleasantries and make small talk. They sit down at the blue table, and the old lady - wearing a different blue dress, blue shoes and blue earrings, pulls out some blue bowls and places them on the table. She asks the men what they would like for breakfast, as the towing company pulls the three cars back on to the road.

""I'll have some Weetabix, please"" says the first.
""I wouldn't mind some cornflakes, if that's alright"" says the second.
""I think I'll go with Weetabix too, please"" says the third.

Couple of days later the rabbit again shows up at the bakery asking for carrotpie: 'you wouldn't happen to have carrotpie now would you?' The baker apologizes for not having carrotpie and the rabbit leaves. That night the baker says to himself: if he shows up a third time, I'll bake a carrotpie for him, I'm the only baker in town and although carrotpie is not my speciality; profit is profit right?

Two days later the rabbit comes walking in again. He asks the baker for carrotpie. 'Sorry', says the baker, 'I still don't have carrotpie; why don't you come back in another two days!'. The rabbit leaves. 

Next few days the rabbit comes walking in. The baker greets him cheerfully: 'hello sir! I have got carrotpie this time, it's fresh out of the oven!'. The rabbit: 'Thanks, but no, I'll have a couple of those lemon cakes you have there'. The baker is utterly confused and asks: 'but you've asked me for carrotpie for so many times, so why don't you want to buy it?!?'

The eldest son forcefully grabbed the youngest daughter by the collar, ""Shut your damn mouth, you hear me? Go fetch pa some water and make it fast."" he shouted, bearing his teeth like a rabid wolf as he ate her up with wide, insane eyes.

The youngest daughter jumped into the arms of the oldest daughter, who was the second oldest child over all. 
""Jesus, you're truly insane, you really are, I will stab you if you ever touch her again. That is a promise."" yelled the oldest daughter and second oldest child overall, cradling the youngest daughter, like she was attempting to collect a shattering mirror. 

""Shut your mouth you whore, you dirty moth,you bitch of the night."" cried the second oldest son, panning his vision between the youngest daughter and oldest daughter and second oldest child overall. 

The oldest son ran to the door, slamming the lock shut, he slowly walked to the farmer.
""Alright,"" he whispered nearly inaudibly, he turned from the farmer and looked at each child, starting counter clockwise from the youngest daughter, ending on the third oldest son, who was silently bawling.

are put on a deserted island [longish]"	selfabortion	70	13	12	"For the purposes of this antijoke, let us suppose that the Hispanic man is not from Europe, but rather Latin America, so as not to be ignorantly redundant.  

They are told that they will be rescued in 24 hours, provided they have proved their survival skills. The Hispanic man is in charge of building a shelter, the European man is in charge of finding food, and the Asian man is in charge of finding supplies. 

The three men go their separate ways to complete their tasks. 24 hours later, the rescue team comes back to the island in the hopes of seeing that the three men can prove their survival skills. 

The Hispanic man takes the rescue team to his shelter that he built, and the rescue team is pleased with his work. The European man takes the rescue team to his stash of food that he has accumulated, and the rescue team is pleased with his work. However, the Asian man with his supplies is nowhere to be found.

The rescue team walks around the island, searching for the Asian man and the supplies he was supposed to find, when suddenly the Asian man jumps out of the bushes and yells **""SUPPLIES!""**

The leader of the rescue team blinks and, after an awkward moment of silence, says, ""Yes, and?""  

""They are right over here behind these bushes, where I was working when you arrived.  I just get excited easily,""  the Asian man answers.  ""Sorry if I startled you.""

The leader of the rescue team responds, ""Okay.  Everything is in order here,"" and they proceed to honor their end of the bargain by rescuing the three men.  

It is a pleasant trip back to the mainland.  "	t5_2r37g	True

There's a metaphor in all of this, a twisted, black pearl that adorns my story, the Raven to my Poe, but eighty-eight days later, the poetic nature of the moment eludes me. I see nothing. I hear nothing. I feel nothing. Eighty-eight days of nothing.
I still remember that day, and in such precise detail. It's unnerving. If events had gone differently, if that fateful day had been just another day in the life, i doubt i'd remember every subtle contour of the painting that I glanced at, in that bustling cafe. The dull minty tingle of the tea i drank while sitting there at 8:04. The sweet aroma that filled the cafe that morning could have been just another detail, but somehow i remember it so vividly, so vividly that every morning it's that subtle smell that starts me from the darkness of my slumber to the darkness of my cell. Somedays I wake up wondering if i had this coming. Most days I wake up knowing I did.
I suppose identity is more than just power. Power can be assumed, usurped and gambled away, but identity is something so much more, something timeless. I've fought mine for so long now that I can't remember the last time I looked in a mirror and recognised the face staring me back, dead in the eyes. Windows to my soul? Hardly. Placards of my identity? Thats an altogether more terrifying idea. These eighty-eight days could be the final stretch of that battle. For all I know this is only the beginning.
Eighty-eight days I've been trapped here, and yet perhaps trapped is the wrong word. Can I really play the prisoner to my own warden?
I sealed my fate, and I now know that. Eighty-eight days ago, I did not. Eighty-eight days ago, my world was a brighter place. The lights are off now in my cell, and yet now, things are brighter than ever. ""Once I was blind, but now I see."" The truth is apparent, and I cling to that final triumph. Sanity slips away. Lights fade away. But Eighty-eight days later, I see what I've been missing. My cell walls fade away, and suddenly all is clear. The darkness is gone, and all is clear. I see all. I know all. All is clear. Eighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box, and in doing so, freed me. Vilification is the purest form of acceptance. The irony there escapes me. Breath escapes me. Life itself escapes me. I myself. Escape. Me.
Eighty-eight days ago, my sister placed me in a shoe box. Eighty-eight days later, I realise the truth.
I am a pair of nikes. All is still. Eighty eight days later, I am a pair of nikes. I  know that now. I cherish that now. I am a pair of nikes. I am a pair of nikes. The screen fades to black. I am a pair of nikes. The curtain falls. I am a pair of nikes. Children cry themselves to sleep, fathers walk out on families, wars break out, and the world breaks down. I am a pair of nikes.
I am a pair of nikes.
Iam apair ofnikes.
Iama pairofnikes.
Iamapairofnikes.
...Nike
Just do it.

Despite the urologist's beauty and the fact that her lubricated and gloved finger was the first time that anything was put into this man's anus (he is on the prudish side of sexual activity and has swatted away a few attempts by girlfriends throughout his life to stimulate his prostrate while performing fellatio on him) he found that her utterly professional and calm demeanor put him at ease and he did not feel nearly the shame and humiliation that he was dreading once he realized that this beautiful woman would be the one examining him. The doctor was pleasantly surprised to find that the man's sphincter was relaxed and his prostate was easier than normal for her to examine. When they were done, and he rearranged his examination gown. The doctor noticed that he had an attractive face and athletic build and she found herself growing aroused. However, she wanted to respect the man's obvious discomfort and embarrassment, and so she retained her friendly, yet professional demeanor and refrained from doing anything that could possibly be construed as flirting. Like the patient, the doctor was also recently divorced, and when she went home that night she thought longingly of meeting a man with a face that was as kind and bashful face as his. When the man went home that night he thought of the beauty of this urologist and wondered if he would ever meet her in a social situation where he could see if his reasonably competent pick up game was strong enough to overcome the uncomfortableness of this exam and ask her out. However, none of this would matter, as the biopsy results of this exam would show that the man had stage 2 prostate cancer which would metastasize soon after and he'd spend the next six months undergoing chemotherapy and surgery to remove his prostate and these would be his last six months on earth as he would die alone 50 pounds lighter. His ex-wife would be the sole attendee of his funeral, she would not cry.

1346018153.0	yvddc	Pink ping pong balls	Devinator117	68	14	8	"A day before his 15th birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' 

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. 

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.
