Every Friday starting TODAY the mods will post a ***Double Jeopardy!*** answer. Make your responses count here guys, because the top 3 commenters each week will be entered into the ***Final Jeopardy!*** contest at the end of the month.


Here's what you need to know:


* *Everyone is eligible to participate* in the weekly ***Double Jeopardy!*** contests (except the mods...). All you need to do is post a response and you're in!
The top three commenters from each week will move on to the ***Final Jeopardy!*** round at the end of the month.


* ***Final Jeopardy!*** will be held between these ***Double Jeopardy!*** winners as well as the previous month's winner and the user who has the highest upvoted comment of the month. Only these contestants will be able to leave comments in the ***Final Jeopardy!*** post. However, everyone else will be able to participate by voting for their favorite response.

* The winner will receive a month's worth of **Reddit Gold**. As well as a trophy flair that when hovered over will show the month and year they won (ooooooh, aahhhhhh). Good luck to all of you!

Yours faithfully, *Alex Trebek*

(Also, if you contestants could go ahead and upvote this for visibility, that'd be great.)

**Rule of thumb**: Ask an example question, then provide your answer and see if it needs to be there. 

Question: ""What is Tom Hank's favorite flavor of ice cream?""
Answer: ""~~This is~~ Manberry Fudge""

By removing the ""This is"", the response feels more natural. So, when should you use ""This""? When you need to identify a type of something.

Question: ""What is a carrot?""
Answer: ""Rabbits are known for their affinity to this vegetable.""

Based on an earlier suggestion to spice things up a bit with categories, this is my effort to add an extra challenge for you when thinking of a response. Taking a page from some of the actual puns used as ""Jeopardy!"" categories, I came up with this. Instead of using ""four-letter words,"" which might lead you down the road to vulgarities and obscenities, I made it ""FOUR-WORD LETTERS."" 

To explain: ""It's a letter (as in, correspondence) which contains four words.""  -/u/CypherAlmasy

It's that simple. I don't know why the four-word responses are being down-voted (unless you just don't like them on their own merit - which is your prerogative), but they shouldn't be if you're misreading the category. So if this is you, kindly stop it. lol

To explain: the category is worded correctly. These are four-word written letters to other people. For example, if the clue were, ""My mother wrote this in my birthday card,"" an acceptable response might be, 

""What is 'You're my favorite child'?"" or, 

""What is 'I never liked you'?"" or even, 

""What is 'I should have swallowed'?"" 

Feel free to include the addressee of the letter if you want. :)"	t5_2wh1y	True

My parents and his friends(colleagues) always spend their dinner time in the restaurant, but in fact it's absolutely not a dinner time!My father alwayscome back home drunk,vomiting,fainted, which's nothing special.When having dinners, they make""cheers!""and just pour the alcohol into their stomach.It usually costs them ￥3000(nearly $500) to enjoy such a meal!!I wonder whether they care about their own health(my father has Hypertension). This is what happened among many people in China, maybe it's owing to the customs and so-called rules which I can't change at all.But how I wish my father and his friends could stop drinking alcohol!!"	t5_2wh1y	True
