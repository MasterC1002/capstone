1361996830.0	19cjw1	Hi it's Earwolf. This is urgent, podcasting needs your help!	Earwolf	95	11	23	"Hello, friends of podcasting!

Today two congressional reps are unveiling the SHIELD Act -- and it could help protect all podcasters, like us, from patent trolls.  We are currently under a direct threat from patent troll Personal Audio, LLC.  This is very real. This could seriously put a stop to your favorite show.

We'll be broadcasting live throughout the day on Earwolf Radio, to give our podcast hosts, guests, and friends a place to voice their opinions on this and ask listeners to support the SHIELD Act. 

We'd like you to help. Please spread the word. Please go to www.eff.org/shield to contact
your representative and tell them to make the SHIELD Act law.

Thanks for your continued support!

-Earwolf Podcasts


Here is more information on the issue:

-Patent trolls are companies who don’t make anything or don’t sell anything, but own patents and use them as a weapon to extort money from businesses and individuals, usually demanding licensing fees that are cheaper than actually litigating a case in court. 

-President Obama recently said that patent trolls are those who “do
not produce anything themselves” and are “trying to leverage and
hijack someone else's idea and see if they can extort some money out
of them.”

-This is really a big problem. It’s not just podcasters who have been
targeted. App developers have been on the hook for using “click to
upgrade” functions, companies who use scan-to-email technology
have been targeted, and so have cafes and public spaces that offer free
access to wifi.

-Two members of Congress, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. and Rep. Jason
Chaffetz, R-Utah, just introduced legislation that would make life harder
for these patent trolls. The bill, the SHIELD Act, would require patent trolls
to pay the other side's costs and fees when they lose. We need to make the
troll business model less attractive so companies like Personal Audio leave
podcasters alone.

-We support this legislation. So should you. Go to www.eff.org/shield to contact
your representative and tell them to make the SHIELD Act law."	t5_2qh1d	True

1345549639.0	ykqxs	Moderation and future of /r/podcasts, I request your comments.	paul57	54	5	56	"WiretapStudios was kind enough to make me a moderator of /r/podcasts this morning.

I have several goals and the first one is to get input from you.

If you have any interest in /r/podcasts then please upvote this post **and** comment. Please comment even if you have nothing to say, even if you are just a lurker. I can see from the traffic stats that there are approximately 200 'unique' visits/day and 450 page-views/day. I don't know how many of those are bots.

Let me know if you have any concerns or requests or advise.

I promise to deal as quickly as possible with any new posts that get caught in the **spam filter**. Don't hesitate to send me a PM if you think your post has been filtered. Warning: please **never delete a post** because I have heard that deleting reinforces the spam filter (if it thought your post was spam then deleting your post makes it more certain that posts like yours are spam).

------------------------------------------

I want to add some features to the sidebar. No promises and no deadlines; however, I am interested in your feedback:

(1) a **FAQ**

(2) a list of all **related subreddits**: bestpodcasts, podcasting, podcast, lolcast, ...; including a section where podcasts are likely to be mentioned (as observed by metareddit's monitor feature)

(3) a link to a **list of podcasters** who promote their new episodes here with relevant information about their podcast

(4) a link to **reviews** of podcasts and/or podcast episodes made by redditors

(5) **podcast rankings**, for example

* based on people voting for their favorite

* based on people submitting a list of the podcasts they subscribe to

* categories such as: open to any podcast, audio only, or restricted only to podcasts that are promoted here

(6) a **New Visitor** survey intended to find out why somebody came to /r/podcasts and what might cause them to return.

(7) a **regular visitor survey** (I'd say subscribers but there is no way to know who is or is not a subscriber): who are you, age range, interests, etc.

(8) **activity statistics** (there are almost endless possibilities of the stats that can be collected but what would be interesting to visitors to /r/podcasts?)

Note: I hope to use Google Docs surveys to simplify and automate many of these features.

1372270938.0	1h4go4	I want to build a Netflix-like website that makes it easy to listen to podcasts from any browser. Thoughts?	pdedecker	52	4	18	"I love Apple's podcast app on iOS, but sometimes I'd rather listen to podcasts on my computer. Although I tried a lot of desktop-based podcatchers over the years, they never really worked for me. iTunes is too bloated and most other apps require you to grab an XML link from a website, download episodes before playing them, they don't remember your playback position and so on. No, I want a free Netflix-like website where I can sign in with my account, add episodes to my listening queue and start streaming them immediately from any internet-connected computer.

Fortunately I know a thing or two about web development, so I got to work. [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWDOTgxjZnA) is a quick video that demonstrates my work so far. It is far from finished, but here's a rundown of all current functionality.

- You can search for podcasts using the search bar.
- On podcast pages, you can add episodes to your queue to listen to them.
- For every item in your queue, the site will remember where you left off. You can come back later to listen to the rest of a podcast.
- You can add podcasts to your favorites so that you can access them quickly. Your favorites page also shows you a list of the most recent episodes from your favorites.
- You can rewind/forward in 15-second increments just like in Apple's iOS app.
- Podcast playback will not be interrupted when you navigate to other pages on the site. I'm using some HTML5 wizardry to make this happen.
- You can get a link to a certain time in an episode so that your friends don't have to manually download the MP3 file and skip to that moment in the podcast.

As podcast producers and listeners, what do you think about this service? Would you be interested in trying it? Do you know any alternatives that provide similar functionality? How do you listen to podcasts in general?

If it's fun, great! If it's practice for something else, great too! 

But to talk about growing your audience or sponsors or monetisation in these fields seems kinda pointless to me! I'm not trying to be rude, but honestly, why?!

**EDIT**: here's what I've learned so far:

* Many people just want more audience to interact with and *don't* want money! It's fun and feels good!

10)  [**Totally Laime**](http://www.totallylaime.com/)- An interview podcast from the home of comedy writer Elizabeth Laime and music producer Andrew Rosen, the charm of this podcast is in how casually the hosts interact with big name comedian guests. Indeed the tagline is 'Asking the most important people the least important questions,' yet some of the deepest and most humorous insights sprout from this casual approach. The show relies on the charisma of the married hosts, so if you don't find them charming you may have a hard time keeping interested.

Top Episode- http://www.totallylaime.com/2012/08/10/episode-132-jon-lajoie/

9) [**Mental Illness Happy Hour**](http://mentalpod.com/)- Comedian/depressive Paul Gilmartin hosts what is arguably the most unique comedy podcast available, where he delves into the personal lives and deep, deep psyches of his guests who range from comedians to musicians to everyday listeners. Gilmartin serves as an amateur psychiatrist who probes the source of his guests' neuroses all the way into childhood trauma, such as molestation and suicide. Gilmartin sees the podcast as a social service and it serves as a community for the depressed, anxious and lonely. There are plenty of moments of humor to offer some levity but the openness of the guests is the core of this fantastic podcast.

Top Episode- http://mentalpod.com/Teresa-Strasser-podcast-fixed

8) [**The Long Shot Podcast**](http://allthingscomedy.com/channels/4/the-long-shot-podcast)- Hosts Eddie Pepitone, Sean Conroy, Amber Kenny and Jamie Flam have an unlikely chemistry, with the former two being established comedy scene stalwarts and the latter two relatively new to comedy. However the battering that Jamie receives from Sean and Eddie provides endless entertainment and Amber's laugh and personality balance out the aggressiveness of the interaction between the other three. There is usually a comedian guest and topic of the day.

Top Episode-http://allthingscomedy.com/contents/1338/4-episode-%23608%3A-the-mailbag-strikes-back-episode-podcast

7) [**Professor Blastoff**](http://www.earwolf.com/show/professor-blastoff/)- Tig Notaro has had [a hell of a year](http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/tig-notaro-talks-about-her-crazy-year.html) and it's a testament to her and her relationship with co-hosts David Huntsberger and Kyle Dunnigan that the show has remained light and hilarious. Professor Blastoff is a science/comedy podcast where a knowledgeable guest expounds on a topic while the three comedians interrupt and mock the guest and each other. David and particularly Kyle are underrated talents and together with Tig provide a likable threesome with an endless line of sharp critiques and the occassional insight into the topic of the day which is always superseded by the comedy crosstalk.

Top Episode- http://www.earwolf.com/episode/gravity/

6) [**The Bone Zone**](http://allthingscomedy.com/channels/21/the-bone-zone)- Brendon Walsh is the 'lead host' and brings a surly but clever voice, Davey Johnston comes from improv and has acute off the cuff contributions, and Randy Liedtke is a relative comedy amateur (he still has a coffee shop day job) but is as naturally hilarious as the other two. Alcohol-fueled bits and outrageous diversions make for never-boring and always hilarious episodes that are surprisingly high concept despite the subject matter.

Top Episode-http://allthingscomedy.com/contents/1390/21-bone-zone-%2349-podcast

5)[**Doug Loves Movies**](http://douglovesmovies.com/)- Comedian Doug Benson is at his funniest on this trivia podcast where actors and comedians play a movie version of Name That Tune based on the cast listing. Despite his reputation as a 'pot comedian', Benson is one of the quickest witted comedians in podcasting and the trivia game is always entertaining and compelling, particularly when the guests get competitive.

Top Episode- Guests Chris Evans, Leonard Maltin and Adam Scott, search the podcast player listing to find the episode.

4) [**The JV Club**](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/the-jv-club/)- Improv Comedian/HuffPost Live Host/Legend of Korra voice actor Janet Varney hosts a women only podcast that digs into the guests' upbringings to reveal the commonalities and fascinating differences between our life paths. It's comparable to a lighter version of Gilmartin's Mental Illness Happy Hour, and Varney is kind and lovable and often uses her improv chops to even out the conversation and put her guests at ease. There are life lessons for young women, fascinating insights into the female point of view for men, and hilarious moments for everyone.

Top Episode- http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/the-jv-club-13-malin-akerman/

3) [**You Made It Weird**](http://www.nerdist.com/podcast/you-made-it-weird/)- Comedian host Pete Holmes has admitted that he basically stole the format from Marc Maron's WTF, but he has a tremendous talent for running an interview (including taking notes when an interesting topic comes up so nothing interesting is lost in the conversation). He has a boisterous love him or hate him personality, but the introspective discussion is really the star of the show as comedian guests are drawn into areas that would normally be off limits such as religion, personal tragedy and sexual anxiety. It's a testament to the show that I personally find Pete slightly annoying yet look forward to new episodes more than any other podcast.

Top Episode-http://www.nerdist.com/2012/10/you-made-it-weird-91-thomas-middleditch/


2) [**Call Chelsea Peretti**](http://feralaudio.com/show/call-chelsea-peretti/)- Comedienne Chelsea Peretti hosts an interview podcast where she allows fans to call in to the show for a discussion of the topics of the day, or wherever the conversation leads. Chelsea is a young, sharp and singular voice in 'alternative' comedy because of her unique upbringing which consisted of working class roots in Oakland ending at an ivy league university. Occasionally a celebrity/comedian friend will call in for a hilarious bit or random conversation but it's Chelsea's harsh introspection tempered by dark humor that makes the show.

Top Episode-http://feralaudio.com/4-being-nice-radishes-bear-attacks/


1) [**Never Not Funny**](http://pardcast.com/)- Still the best of the best, Comedian Jimmy Pardo hasn't lost a step as he continues to dish out the fastest, most clever and incisive off the cuff banter with comedian/musician guests. Check out his yearly Pardcast-athon for a 12 hour straight endurance comedy bonanza for charity with guests such as Conan O'Brien and Laraine Newman.

Someone seems to be systematically downvoting every new episode posted by *anyone*. There's a sea of zeros on here, and considering most of the r/podcasts content seems to be new episodes of people's podcasts, I'm curious as to why this is happening.

Personally, I don't give a shit about Reddit karma, but the reason I bother posting my show on here at all is on the off-chance someone might be curious and might give it a listen. I'm assuming others are doing the same.

...so what's the rationale behind downvoting everything? The link to the FAQ on the sidebar doesn't seem to go anywhere, so if everyone here is violating some kind of r/podcasts rule, I don't think anyone is aware."	t5_2qh1d	True

I spend most time listening to university lectures. Mostly History.

My favorite podcasts are:

[No Agenda](http://www.noagendashow.com/) Crackpot: Adam Curry and Buzzkill: John C Dvorak provide conspriacy-ish analysis of world news via big media skepticism flavored with parody of morning zoo-ish shows a la Howard Stern. Come for the media assassination, come back for the catchy jingles.

[Unfilter](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/unfilter/) Similar to NA with it's reporting of current events. Started by NA listeners to focus on a younger, cleaner, less suggestive tone. Not as fun as NA but shorter.
[Unfilter's reddit](http://unfilter.reddit.com)

[Dan Carlin - Common Sense](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/csarchive) A discussion on current events and how to think about them. I really wish more people would get into this one.

[Dan Carlin - Hardcore History](http://www.dancarlin.com/disp.php/hharchive) I've heard critiques of the accuracy of his depictions, but the shows are very entertaining, and accurate enough. If you're a history major he might disappoint you, but if you're a casual observer these shows are great. But long.

[Le Show - Harry Shearer](http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/ls) Nice little jazz flavored news and editorial program by Harry Shearer from New Orleans

[NPR Intelligence^2](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_detail.php?siteId=7457039) Oxford style debates. Topics are typically on pretty heavy and intricate, topics like: is a dictator better for Islamic countries than democracy, or the morality of genetic patenting, should drugs be legalized, are the rich taxed enough...

Stuff You Should Know is good sometimes. Stuff You Missed In Histroy Class is OK but I find the girls to sound annoying sometimes.

[Skeptic's Guide](http://www.theskepticsguide.org/) I listen to sometimes but get bored of.

I have more in my Doggcatcher App I use on my S3 (love my 32gb microSD) but with the lectures I don't have time for them.

I try to stay away from any of the more commercially minded shows like the tech shows that mostly sound the same and all focus on consumer goods."	t5_2qh1d	True

1313082129.0	jfugs	Just discovered this subreddit, here are my top 10 comedy podcasts	jesuz	20	1	18	"10) [Professor Blastoff](http://www.earwolf.com/show/professor-blastoff/)- 3 comedians, two of whom have BS's, engage in a Comedy-heavy discussion of various ""intellectual"" topics with a knowledgeable guest; sort of a Radiolab-lite but even less informative and much funnier.

9) [The Pod F. Tompkast](http://pft.libsyn.com/)- Paul F. Tompkins plays an interview with comedian Jen Kirkman, recordings from a live sketch show, and a prerecorded one-man skit where he works through various characters. Tompkins is a comedy virtuoso and even his off-the-cuff interstitials have moments of inspiration.

8) [Marc Maron WTF](http://www.wtfpod.com/)- Marc Maron is able to dig deep into the psyche of his guests, as well as finding the humorous side to the sometimes serious personal events discussed. Some of the most interesting interviews you'll hear in any medium.

7) [The Lavender Hour](http://lavenderhour.com/)- The smart and funny couple of Duncan Trussel and Natasha Leggero lead a comedian guest on a hilarious conspiracy-laden discussion about various social, political and psychological topics. You'll love it or hate it yet be compelled to listen either way.

6) [Jordan, Jesse, go!](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go)- Comedian Jordan Morris and NPR host Jesse Thorne banter with a comedian guest about the minutiae of their lives. Nerdy humor yet without much scifi/tech discussion, always interesting no matter how insignificant the topic.

5) [The Nerdist](http://www.nerdist.com/category/podcast/)- Nerdy discussion/interview with comedians, SciFi directors and actors, and Zoey Deschanel. Chris Hardwick with two comedians co-hosting. Great guests with great interaction.

4) [Who Charted?](http://www.earwolf.com/show/who-charted-howard-kremer-and-kulap-vilaysack/)- Howard Kremer and Kulap Vilaysack go through various charts (movies, music) with guests, culminating with a chart about the guest's life and career. The hosts are endearing and hilarious.

3)[Doug Loves Movies](http://douglovesmovies.com/)- Doug Benson hosts a live game show where 3 comedians/movie stars/directors compete to show their movie knowledge. Edgy, hilarious, often surprising, and the guests take the game more seriously than you'd expect.

2) [Comedy Bang-Bang](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang-podcast/)- Host Scott Aukerman (Mr.Show, Between Two Ferns) hosts an improv heavy discussion with a guest and a comedian in character. If you appreciate the sometimes bizarre comedy of Mr. Show you'll enjoy the ex-head writer's unique comedy style and hyper-meta approach. 

1) [*Never Not Funny*](http://pardcast.com/)- Comedian Jimmy Pardo leads a quick witted interview/discussion with an actor/comedian guest. The most consistently hilarious podcast available, with a likable host and staff. The first 20+ min are free but you have to pay for the full hour and a half show.

I'm big into history and started with history podcasts but I'm always looking to expand and find new things and I kept on hearing about how Joe Rogan was one of the best podcasters out there so I decided to check him out. 

I've tried listening to a few of his shows but I always end up stopping partway through because, to be totally honest, the guy is fucking *terrible.* I most recently tried to get through his talk with Dan Carlin, who I'm a huge fan of, and I just couldn't do it. Joe and whatever guys he's with just come off sounding like a bunch of idiot fratboy douches who have absolutely nothing insightful or even articulate to say. I honestly felt bad for Dan, he would try to make some sort of a point or argument and Joe would just cut in with the dumbest, most pseudointellectual bullshit that sounds like the ""deep"" things a stoner comes up with. And then his buddy would come in with totally off-topic and immature innuendos. It was atrocious.

This isn't me ranting about why I hate Joe Rogan. I really want to know if I'm missing something, or if he does a different podcast that's much better, or if his quality has dropped recently or something. The guy's insanely popular so he must be doing something right, but from what I've heard from several of his recent episodes he sounds like a total idiot.

Along with the final decision to be still made by you guys on the [future of the downvote button](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1bwksn/do_you_want_the_downvote_button_hidden_on/) in this subreddit, this is not the only change we will be implementing (or not if you guys vote in favour of keeping the downvote button).

**Cracking down on spam**

Us mods have been discussing measures to deal with the issue of spam posts and the need to uphold [Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/), and most applicable to the current situation is this one:

&gt;""Don't spam. [–] What is spam? NOT OK: Submitting only links to your blog or personal website. OK: Submitting links from a variety of sites and sources. OK: Submitting links from your own site, talking with redditors in the comments, and also submitting cool stuff from other sites. NOT OK: Posting the same comment repeatedly in multiple subreddits.""

**""What does this mean?""**

We've got a lot of people posting on /r/podcasts who only ever post links to their podcasts when on Reddit, and they engage in nothing else on the *entire* site. This kind of activity goes against ""Don't spam"" and from Monday 22 April 12pm BST (the same time as voting closes on the downvote button) myself and other mods will be enforcing this rule.

**""But how will we promote our podcasts?""**
There will be a daily new episodes text post for people to reply to with links and descriptions of their latest episodes, including whether it's NSFW in the description.

We'll also be beefing up the Wiki (i.e. adding one), which will include a directory of podcasts. We've already created a Google Form to submit information for this, [which you can find here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EMB21UiYPZPcILM-iW0eioFumJgQjFpDME2VL-sbHtk/viewform).

**""But this is my first podcast episode.""**
Don't meet the minimum episode count for the directory submissions form? It's cool, you can still submit your podcast as a post, but it must be a *text post* and include a description of what your podcast is about and say whether it's NSFW. We can't guarantee feedback, but if you follow these steps you will be more likely to get some.

**""I really want some feedback/advice and my podcast has been going for a while.""**

And you're welcome to post a text post asking for this as above.

**""When are links okay?""**

Found a decent article or video or presentation or whatever on podcasting and want to share it? Then it's okay to post it as a link, but obviously you still have to stay within Reddit's rules regarding posting links to your own content i.e. you can post the link to your blog post about getting the most out of podcasting, but you better be posting and commenting on things that aren't just your own content.

*BUT* if people continue to spam with links to their podcasts after 22 April, then we will be following the move /r/marketing and other subreddits have taken: we will disable link submissions on this subreddit.


**Other changes**

The sidebar will be altered to reflect these changes in the near future.

We also finally hope to include a FAQ on podcasting in our new Wiki.

**Summary**

* We'll be truly cracking down on spam, as described by [Reddit's rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) from **22 April**
* We're going to start posting a daily text post where people will be able to post links to their new episodes
* A new Wiki is being created and it is going to include a directory of podcasts submitted by the community, [submissions form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EMB21UiYPZPcILM-iW0eioFumJgQjFpDME2VL-sbHtk/viewform)
* The new Wiki will aim to have a FAQ on podcasting (ideas for resources to include are welcome)
* Link posts that are not promotional are okay
* You're still welcome to ask for feedback
* If people continue to post spammy link posts, the submit a link function will be removed
* EDIT: you'll still be welcome to ask for podcast listening suggestions.

We do it for fun with no intention of doing it full time; however, like I said, we put a lot of work into it.  We just wanna make sure *anyone* is listening.

The rules can be found at [The /r/podcasts FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/podcasts#rules).

Most of this is standard procedure: no flagrantly racist or sexist comments, no spamming, and please don't use link shorteners when linking to your site, etc... The main thing I want to bring your attention to is: 

**No linking directly to the audio file for your podcast**. 

We feel that /r/podcasts works best when it helps listeners find new podcasts or connects podcast creators. However, that can't be done if all you link to is an audio file with no reasonable way to contact the creator, find out more about the podcast, or even look for more podcasts from the same person. For this reason we feel you should be required to at least provide some basic website or blog where your podcast is linked from, or at least use a self post where you can describe your podcast before linking to it.

We of course welcome feedback from the community on this rule, so if you disagree with this ban on links to audio files or any of the other rules we've set out, please let us know. However, as of now, if any audio files are posted, they will be removed and a message will be left for the user informing them that audio file posts are not allowed and asking them to submit again when they can link to a website, blog, YouTube page or some other source.

1371207648.0	1gbxri	Seeking BETA testers SoundWaves. A Free Libre and Open Source Podcasting app for Android.	bottiger	13	0	8	"Hey everyone.

Since it's okay to promote your own podcast I also hope you are okay with me making a little plug for my own pet-project.

For the last couple of months I've been working on a podcast client for Android. The motivation has been the lack of a really good client. Since I started working Pocket Casts 4 was released and actually delivered a lot of the things I originally intended to solve. However, I still believe there is room for my application.

The goal is to make a really good podcast client which **always** put the user first and doesn't collect any strange data, annoying ads or other things we don't want. 

Here are some bullet points.

* Free and Open Source
* No ads, up-sells or other things we don't like.
* Privacy aware. I does not spy on you in any way.[1]
* Cross device syncing
* Easy playlist sorting
* Import old Google Listen feeds from Google Reader (for the next week or two at least :) )
* And just a nice look&amp;feel in general

The todo list is long an ambitious but now I just working on getting it to a stable state. However, I only have a limited number of phones to test on, and only one I use every day so I would really like to have some beta-tester helping me out.

The state of the app *is* a bit rough today, but I have managed to convert it into my main podcasting application.

You can get the beta-version from the play store by joining the google+ community (required by Google, sorry), and follow the link there: https://plus.google.com/communities/112499725575016472220
And you can get the source and some screenshots (slightly outdated) here: https://github.com/bottiger/SoundWaves

If you are interested in helping me out please install it and give me all the feedback you can. Most crashes should be reported automatic, but interface feedback are also welcome.
If you can help out by creating a new icon you are also more than welcome to send me a PM or e-mail at bottiger@gmail.com

And at last: Have a nice day.

[1] However, during the current BETA state automatic anonymous crash reporting have been turned on by default.

I'm fairly new to podcasts and I've just borrowed my brother's iPod (old school shit - all white, red backlight, black &amp; white screen, weighs a ton) to help me pass all those long hours on public transport.

I'm a big fan of Ricky Gervais and Steven Merchant. I've listened to all of their podcasts (*The Ricky Gervais Show* and *The Ricky Gervais' Guide to...*) and I found them very enjoyable - this type of talk show / comedy is exactly what I'm after.

Additionally, I've started looking through *The Joe Rogan Experience* podcasts, because I like Rogan as a stand-up comedian and he brings on some great guests (people I wouldn't otherwise know about) and discusses really interesting topics, from ancient history, psychedelics and aliens to modern-day 'gossip' and martial arts, but in a very informal 'in-my-own-living-room"" fashion.

So those are the types of shows I like to listen to - not overly formal, interesting discussions, humour, not too much about (American) politics. 

I also wouldn't mind *learning* a bit, like about space - I could listen to Neil deGrasse Tyson talk all day, but I don't think he has any podcasts/audiobooks out there (?). So if you know of any more formal, but still interesting, podcasts that fit the bill, let me know also.

Thanks for your suggestions. If nothing, I hope at least someone checks out Ricky Gervais' or Joe Rogan's podcasts as a result of reading this thread."	t5_2qh1d	True

The hope is that users will offer constructive criticism and write reviews for those shows on iTunes. This will hopefully encourage folks to listen to community-created shows and help improve iTunes rankings.

A few rules:

* You need to have your show listed in the [Podcast Directory](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/communitypodcasts) to be selected
*  Moving forward we will only select shows if someone from the show has offered feedback or written reviews for another show (It would be helpful if you updated your flair to highlight which show you're on)
* The feedback offered must be constructive.
* If you write a review on iTunes, it should be a positive one.
* For the sake of transparency: we will not include moderator-produced shows.

Essentially, just make sure we know who you are and try to help those that help others. Please make sure you're trying to help, not hurt, other members of the community. This is new, so please contact me or /u/milliways86 if you have feedback.

The spotlight for the week includes:

**[The Thing Committee Podcast](http://thingcommittee.com/)**

The Thing Committee is the definitive authority on what's a thing and what's not a thing. At Thing Committee meetings they turn on the microphones, click record, and decide what's a thing and what's not a thing. It's a public service. Regular hosts are Josh Withers and Steve Molk. [Find them on iTunes.](https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/the-thing-committee-podcast/id599541259)

**[A Jumps B Shoots](http://ajumpsbshoots.com/)**

A video game podcast, recorded in Portland, OR, that focuses on the culture, community, art, music, and love of the craft of video games. We interview developers, journalists, academics, collectors, writers, and musicians to broaden our understanding of this relatively new and exciting medium. They also alternate those topics with a bi-weekly Whatch'a Playin' episode to keep folks informed about what they are playing and how they like it.

1369339187.0	1exa1j	Podcast Sponsorship.	TheCarlwood	12	2	3	"Hey guys, thought maybe some people might have some less generic advice for attaining podcast sponsors. 

I've heard of services that line up advertisers with podcasts, but they seem a lot less profitable that a direct exchange. Of course it's good to have a media kit created and know the obvious info about your show, downloads, audience, etc.

That said, my show The Higherside Chats has made a name for itself in the conspiracy/paranormal niche and I can usually depend on about 30k downloads, although it varies a lot based on the guest/topic. 

I've heard about a standard metric of $100 per 5,000 a few places online ad if that we're true; with one show a week, I could be looking at something near $2400 a month from a single sponsor.

Obviously, there are no guarantees and there's a lot of factors involved, but who wouldn't be excited about that possibility? 

Has anyone tried the advertising services that are out there? 
Anyone found a successful method for finding sponsors?
Has anyone been able to transition successfully to podcasting as a sole source of income? 

I think this is the dream for most podcasters, so maybe we can talk about ideas/options?

One fairly creative thing I've done with mine, was that I created my own small company (conspiracy themed tshirts) and I sponsor my own show. This does a couple of things. First of course, I sell a related product to thousands of people at no cost and its easier to sell a shirt than it is to get a donation. That helps monetize the show a bit and helps the host get used to reading ads and stuff. It also might make a show seem more professional to some extent, and having an ad could prompt a listener with a small business to inquire about ads. Just some thoughts, and most of this type of stuff is case by case, but anyone have anything to share?"	t5_2qh1d	True

1365757844.0	1c7392	Short and sweet - good podcasts between ~5 and ~20 minutes per episode?	esau1	17	5	20	"I listen to a lot of podcasts but most of them are long form, clocking in at over 45 minutes per ep. They're great , but sometimes I like something wrapped up in a nice little 10 or 15 minute package that I can fit into a small window of time. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for anything that fits the bill? I'm always looking to hone my podcast subscriptions.

For reference, here's my current subscription list (although I'm very open to anything interesting, thought-provoking and/or funny):

&gt;99% Invisible / Ask Me Another / Caustic Soda / The Complete Guide to Everything / Dan Carlin's Hardcore History / Freakonomics Radio / Giant Bombcast / Intelligence Squared / The Nerdist / Overthinking It / Point of Inquiry / Radiolab / Radio Three Sixty / Savage Lovecast / Skeptoid / SModcast / StarTalk Radio / TED Radio Hour / This American Life / Uhh Yeah Dude / Unfictional / The Vergecast / Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!

Of those above, Skeptoid is really the only one that sits around 10 minutes per episode, and it works great in that format.

Alternatively, if you think I'm just missing out on anything major regardless of length, please do recommend.

Thanks in advance!

Trailer Trash w/ Mike and Garrett is a podcast where me (Mike) and my co-host Garrett use upcoming movie trailers to get to know our guests. Our guests tend to include very funny local Philadelphia based comedians but we also have had a few musicians and the pleasure of interviewing comedy great Todd Glass.

We are also sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon, play a bunch of jingles and some games. 

We just recorded our first live episode in Philadelphia (that will be out sometime in April) and we have been on iTunes ""New and Noteworthy"" for 6 weeks in a row. 

If you are looking for a new podcast to listen to and you enjoy movie talk please check us out and let us know what you think! Thanks!

We are available on iTunes and Stitcher Radio. 
New episodes are every Tuesday and Friday.

Basically the idea would be to use this subreddit to match up similar podcasts to exchange plugs or promos and by doing so help each other build our shows audiences and create networking opportunities for podcasters. Also it would be a good way of using this subreddit for promotion that wasn't just posting links to the latest episode.

This could be done a few ways. Here are a few ideas I had as to how to do this
*I create thread for this in which someone could post a comment with a link to their podcast and a short description and then someone who wanted to trade plugs could reply with their intrest and their own link and description. On the next episode of their podcasts both users would tell their listeners about the other one's podcast. There is no reason only two users could participate in this.
*Each plug request gets its own thread. The title could start with something like [Plug Swap]. Inside the post the OP could provide the link and description. Other users could post comments with their own description, link and agreement to swap plugs. Maybe the title of the post isn't about the OP's podcast but about the topic. That way there could be something like ""[Plug Swap] Comedy Podcasts"" and everyone on here that does comedy podcasts could go there to discuss promoting each other.

Both of these ideas could also work with promos as well.

I think option two would be the easiest to manage and a good way to keep each plug swap going as long as it had legs. I think it would encourage many people to get involved in each swap and be a good way of creating networking opportunities between podcasters with similar topics for their shows.

I appreciate any help/ advice anyone can offer about getting this started.

1370298568.0	1fm19q	Interest in joining Online Radio Station/Podcast Network? [NSFRadio]	katakoon	14	3	8	"Hello, my name is Sam Miller and was just wondering around for people who may be interested in possibly joining our podcast talk/comedy online radio station and podcast network called NSFRadio (Not Safe for Radio).

NSFRadio is an online radio station and podcast network focused on bringing together some of the best in independent talk and comedy podcasts. NSFRadio will be launching in July/August and we hope to have a full slate of awesome podcasts.

Currently NSFRadio is comprised of Too Fat Dudez(TooFatDudez.podomatic.com), Fawlcast (www.fawlcast.com), and PASCast (www.pascast.com), but as you can imagine we’re looking for more podcasts to help us fill out our 24/7 format. We’re looking for shows with a reliable release schedule who want to be a part of our online radio network.

We’re also looking for people who would enjoy to do a live show format as well, we are welcome to ideas on how to best incorporate live shows into our format.

What’s in it for you? Free advertising, the ability to run live shows at no cost to you, and another avenue for people to consume and find your podcasts.

What’s in it for NSFRadio? The chance to build a really awesome channel around some very interesting and funny podcasts and live radio shows. There won’t be advertising on the channel (at least channel-branded, podcasts can do as they wish) unless it’s something all of the shows agree to do together at some point down the road.

If we grow to a certain size where perhaps a way to monetize is possible or needed (such as advertising or something), we'll definitely think of ways to do that and then also try to add things for members of the station and network, such as podcast hosting and the like.  But that isn't certain until we launch and figure everything out.

If you have any questions about this please contact me at nsfradionetwork@gmail.com!  I can also answer questions in this thread and in PMs!  Thanks for taking your time to read this, everyone!"	t5_2qh1d	True

Every week on our show we have a segment called Pocast Community Outreach Program where we listen to and review a podcast that's reached out to us on social media (facebook, twitter).  Unfortunately, in a few weeks, that well will have dried up.  We need more shows to review!

So if you'd like your show to be reviewed on an upcoming episode of The Podcast... Cast, then reply to this post with the following information:

1.  The name of your podcast
2. A link to your podcast
3. A particularly exemplary episode that you'd like us to check out.  If you just want us to listen to the most recent one, you can skip this step.

I guarantee if you reply to this, we WILL review your show.  Just be warned, we're not shills -- If we don't like what you're doing, we'll say so (in a hopefully constructive manner).  Also be warned, it'll probably take us a few weeks to get to you.

1355724237.0	14zc96	How did you become interested in listening to podcasts?  	BPiddy	12	2	18	My story:   I was bored at work one day (fall of 2009) and was surfing through iTunes on my phone.  I had listened to a couple of podcasts here and there.  Then I found Adam carolla's show and I had always liked what he had to say.  So I subscribed...that was just the beginning.  I've always liked comedy albums.  I used to listen to comedy radio on Yahoo's internet radio and when I found this entire catalog of free comedy podcasts, I couldn't believe it.  Now I have at least 15 different comedy podcasts that I subscribe to.  It's insane.  Podcasting is at the forefront right now.  I recently heard that Stitcher is working with automakers to get their app into new car stereos, much like Pandora has for music.  It's coming folks...	t5_2qh1d	True

This will not cost anyone anything. I love podcasting and the exchange of ideas. I have passion for putting this together, and I hope to turn it into something great for everyone involved. I plan to build a website to serve as a hub for this network, grow a strong social media presence, and in the long term, I would also like to include writers, citizen journalists, and film makers too.

He has always had a tendency toward spitefulness, and these added to his comedic appeal and even made him endearing while he was an underdog.  

However, since the relative success of WTF, this part of his nature has had the opposite effect.  The impulses that he once channeled into defiance against fate now manifest as occasional insensitivity and even mild contempt toward a guest or an audience member.

It's quite subtle, and not all that frequent, but I have found this hint of a mean streak to be distasteful given the new context.  I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed this.

Here's what I am thinking.

Comment to this post with the following information about your own podcast:

* **Category** (sports, technology, NSFW humor, TV, movies, etc.)
* **Length** (approximate)
* **Name of podcast**
* **Link** to recent or favorite episode

Once we group the podcasts into like categories, podcasters from each group can rate 2-3 podcasts from the same group, providing objective and constructive criticism. This will also serve to rank similar podcasts. Comment with the above information only if you are willing to listen to a few other podcasts and critique them. 

I will give it a few days for the comments to pour in. After that I can make a chart assigning podcasts to listen to and rate. If someone has a more efficient rating/voting system than a spreadsheet I would appreciate input and help.

1366538570.0	1csknc	New rules, a new wiki and more - all happening here at /r/podcasts	milliways86	15	7	7	"Hi everyone.

So, from tomorrow the mods will begin enforcing spam rules in a far more active manner than we've previously done.

**New rules**

I've put together a wiki page explaining the rules of posting to /r/podcasts, you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/rules) in our sidebar and in the wiki tab, which previously wasn't available.

It includes information on how to not be a spammer and the signs of when you've been shadowbanned.

**New wiki**

That's right the wiki is ALIVE! Including a [new directory section with podcast listings](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/communitypodcasts).

**From April 22**

We really don't want to see any more link posts that are directly to your podcast, we want you to use [daily episode text posts like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1cshx1/april_21_tell_us_about_your_latest_episode_get/), or self text posts if you want feedback. Check out the [rules part of the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/wiki/rules) for what's okay to post - some links are okay, but check the wiki for what.

**IF** people continue to post link posts to their podcasts come April 29, we'll be disabling the ability to submit link posts.

**The future of the downvote button**

I'll let you know tomorrow what the verdict is on that.

Have a nice Sunday.

EDIT: If we do have to remove link posts, we may allow people to just do self/text posts to their latest episode, rather than a daily thread."	t5_2qh1d	True

This is still a trial, because the full enforcement doesn't come in until Monday April 22. But if you want to give the new format a go - please reply to this post with:

* Podcast name and episode number

1365991171.0	1cd2i9	What's your show's elevator pitch?	pundemic	12	1	19	"Howdy folks, I've been thinking about this a lot recently and I know that it's hard to choose what shows to listen to here since there are so many and a lot of them cover the same topics. With that in mind, I'm curious: what is your show's elevator pitch? Essentially, if we were stuck in an elevator how would you convince me to watch your show? What sets your show apart from others like it? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

My cohost and I for Dento and The Robot just had this discussion and we've decided that while we love the entertainment podcasts we want to do something a bit more and really get back to our roots about ""learning to become adults."" Basically we want our show to help people discover what makes them happy, what makes their life meaningful, and how to pursue those things. Obviously those are lofty goals and we still want to focus on being entertaining and fun, but we also want to add some more depth.

If you're interested here's a link to the [episode](http://dentoandtherobot.com/2013/04/15/the-elevator-pitch/)

So, I think it would be helpful for me and everyone else on here that wants new content if you posted a link to the most recent (or your personal favorite) episode of your own podcast, and gave a short description of what it's about and why we should listen to it. 

A warning: any podcasts described as some combination of the following:

* you and your hilarious friends having a free-form conversation

* a celebration of nerd culture

* a weekly review of new or retro video games

* answering questions from popular question services like Yahoo

...will be met with stern skepticism. The world already has more than enough of those. I want something new, different and interesting, not some that's similar to but worse than the stuff I already know about.

We want to grow bigger, and up to now the only way we promote it is through Facebook and Twitter, so a big chunk of our listeners actually know us personally. What ideas do Redditors have for guerrilla marketing our podcast? Our funds are limited (as in almost nothing) but there must be free or inexpensive methods with which we can get exposure. Our audience is young professionals, mostly male. Here's a rundown of our segments:

Opening: Talk about personal shit (this is really peppered throughout the whole podcast with our stories and the like).

News: News.

Russell Crowe reads his Twitter: Charlie puts on a bad Australian accent, as if Mr. Crowe is really with us in studio, and reads his recent tweets. If you haven't read his tweets they're completely lame and almost always have to do with working out.

This week in fascism: A segment where we dream about our utopia, usually by selecting a person or group of persons to jail indefinitely (e.g. super hot girls who are self-described ""nerds"" or ""dorks"").

Would you rather: Simple, and always fun.

Anonymous questions: We answer personal questions from listeners, modeled after Loveline except it's anonymous.

The refractory period: We relax and talk about people we admire, those who we should model ourselves after (Nick Offerman, Mike Rowe, Louis CK, other unknowns). Sometimes in this segment we'll offer a piece of positive advice, something for self improvement.

We don't do all the segments every episode, we rotate them in and out and we're always developing new stuff. I'd like to give the name and iTunes link to this baby, but I fear being lambasted by the community for shameless self promotion.

1374695447.0	1iz779	Techniques to grow your podcast audience outside of friends and family	sterling70	12	3	9	"Hey everyone... I though this would be a good place for us to share and ask about techniques used to grow your podcast audience outside the people you already know. Our podcast, ""The Devil's Advocates,"" is relatively new (6 weeks in) but I've definitely noticed some things that work and don't work, and I'm hoping some of you might have some helpful information on the subject as well so we can all assist each other.

Some things that don't seem to work for us:

* flyers and cards (I use trackable QR codes to trace where our listeners come from)
* tweeting about it (I've build up a following of around 800 followers on Twitter, doesn't seem to do much though when I mention the podcast on there)
* SEO of our website www.wearethedevilsadvocates.com - it's pretty well SEO'd at this point and comes up pretty high in searches, but there's just not a lot of organic searching as far as I can tell

Things that do work:

* Google AdWords. I get definite clicks through to our site and itunes page, though not many, and probably 25% of those give us a listen. It's not much and it's not cheap, but it does work.
* Facebook page- our page, www.facebook.com/wearethedevilsadvocates seems to be corresponding with increased mp3 DLs.

1367397530.0	1dgzfr	Link posts update	milliways86	11	2	9	"Hi all, so you may remember me moaning about the volume of link posts last week, well the 29th has been and gone and link posts are still enabled, but it is looking like I will have to scrap them.

During the last 7 days I have sent out 47 messages to people who have posted link posts for their episodes, asking them to remove these posts and instead make a post in a daily post thread.

Admittedly some have responded well to the requests and have said that they didn't know the rules had changed, which is fair. However, a significant proportion of those people were first time posters to Reddit, clearly looking to get some quick traffic to their podcasts, with the link post being their first ever post.

It would have been far easier for me to have personally marked all these posts as spam and doomed them to the modqueue and the path of shadowbanning, rather than sending direct messages to offenders (as I have been doing). But the levels of link posts are too high.

So, my options as I see them are:

* Remove link post option on /r/podcasts

Or

* Keep link posts, but change the text on the button so that it suggests that we only want links to content about podcasting
* And if I go with that second bullet: every post that fails to fit with the new guidelines is then marked as spam

Because we're trying to bait more of the friendoverse into participating, we're going to be just a BIT more selective in choosing which ones to answer. Long-time listeners will probably get more rub at first, BUT if your question or comment is interesting, we'll more than likely read it.

Also, here are the most frequently asked questions, which we won't answer again, because we've done so a million tiems!

How or how long does it take for Larson to grow his beard? A: About 3 weeks from shaving completely.

How did Steve and Larson meet? A: High School Physics, we bonded in Junior College Astronomy.

Do you even lift? A: Steve does, about 4-5 times a week at the gym. Chongo goes 6 days, and Larson chooses to consider DDP Yoga as his method of exercise.

Machinima Gossip Question A: We don't answer these things. We love our job and aren't gonna jeopardize that to scuttlebutt. Plus, we work 400 miles away from the office, so we don't even know what goes on there most of the time.

ANY QUESTION BY CHRIS TEBUTT WILL BE ANSWERED, because Steve loves his theme song.

If you could (blank) using (blank number) of wrestlers, past or present, who would you use?/Any WWE Raw related question. A: We talk enough about wrestling in the open, chances are, if you want to know about our Raw thoughts, we've already talked about it, so don't waste a question on it.

Basically I just want some input on how to make my show run smoothly and consistently.  For instance here are a few things that have been on my mind:

1) Should I enforce a time limit on my shows (I know a lot of podcasts can go over an hour, but really how many people have that much time or patience in one sitting?)

2) Should my show have an overall theme and segments? (I talk a lot about pop culture in my routines on stage and plan on doing so on the show as well.  Should I just dedicate a certain segment to pop culture or just kind of loosely base it off pop culture and ramble because I would like to talk about other things as well.)

3) Should I have an opening/closing jingle?

4) What is the best website/platform to host from and get recognition on? (I hear a lot of people use SoundCloud because it's free and easy)

5) What is the process of getting a podcast on itunes? (I know in order to get it on itunes a podcast has to be in RSS feed format, is there any easy or free way of doing that? I can only find subscription services)

1375037226.0	1j87n8	Fighting with audio problems on our podcast and looking for some advice	itatton	8	0	8	"We've got a small podcast with 4 primary hosts and sometimes up to 8-10 people (which I know and understand is chaos).  I'm really struggling with trying to keep everyone leveled properly.  The nature of our show is just capturing unscripted/unprompted discussion/conversation/debates and I've got two issues

* Hardware - I've got 4 XLR mics and 4 1/8in jack random mics.  I know I need to replace 3 of the 1/8in ones because they are things like Xbox or Singstar mics.  The mics run into an R-1604FX Wharfdale which run into an iMic and then into the Macbook.  For whatever reason, the output isn't loud enough from the mixer on it's own so I boost it through the iMic.  When there are only 4 people and we can use the XLR mics I can manage everyone levels much easier.  The problem I have is when we're split between the XLR and the 1/8in mics the audio is all over the board.  I'll have to keep the XLR mic channels between 1-3 and the 1/8in mic channels between 8-10.  I know we need to buy new mics and I don't want to repost mic recommendations because I can go through the old threads, but before I invest more money in equipment I need to figure out if we really need a different mic setup (like maybe some strategically placed omnidirectional condenser mics).  Unfortunately my board only has the 4 XLR jacks or I'd run all of the mics in XLR.  The other problem is we aren't monetizing at all so all hardware costs are coming out of my pocket right now. 

* The conversation levels - Like I mentioned before, this is the nature of our podcast.  We're not professional at all.  We just get a group of people together and talk about different topics and our small listener base seems to enjoy it.  I really don't want to damage that dynamic.  That being said, we frequently go from someone talking quietly into the mic into a roar of laughter and excited comments.  I've tried coaching people into speaking into the mic directly, but I still have to ride the board for pretty much the whole show and even then we still top out a lot when people get excited.  Does anyone have any experience with this type of format that could either offer some advice or point me towards some decent learning materials online?

Thanks in advance for any advice you folks can give us.  Even though we're just some friends doing something we enjoy, we're starting to get bigger than I anticipated and starting to interview more people and I really feel like we need to get these issues under control so the output is a little more professional."	t5_2qh1d	True

This is despite putting a lot of effort into advertising the new rules.

Rather than mark people as spammers, I reached out to people individually and asked them to take down posts and post them on the current episode thread.

But the volume is at the level where it's easier for me to just remove posts rather than mark them as spam or wait for people to respond to removal requests. I don't like to think that everyone who posts a link onto /r/podcasts is a spammer and constantly marking people's posts as spam could lead to them being shadowbanned on Reddit.

What I'm saying is - I'm seriously, *seriously* considering removing the ability for people to submit link posts to this subreddit. I have previously warned that if things didn't clear up by next Monday that it would probably be case of removing the link post function.

1370860822.0	1g1dfd	So here's an interesting question - forgo trackable downloads to grow your audience more/faster?	bluepisces	10	3	2	"I was with Rick of Shit Rick Says yesterday (he was meeting a friend of mine for the first time, we ended up doing an impromptu record in a restaurant) and mentioned to him that I took direct download links off the blog so we can TRACK the downloads, but I told him I'd read on here that feedburner doesn't seem to be super reliable, he said 'yeah and I know alot of my friends have said they listen directly through the blog', and I was like 'oh, oops'. My friend asked us what our audience was like and I said we don't really know beyond a core of loyal listeners, so I asked Rick and he said he'd prefer to grow the show by having it more easily available even if not totally trackable, and after thinking about it for a second, I decided he was probably right.

I know for podcasting the numbers are ever important for potentially securing sponsors/advertising, but ultimately you do want more listeners and if you get more by making it easier for them and not forcing them to only use platform A or B to get the show so you can track it, is it worth losing some numbers?

In our case it barely matters as we are very new so our audience isn't very big... So I guess it makes sense, but for any of the shows that aren't huge but aren't tiny anymore either, what are your thoughts?"	t5_2qh1d	True

At the very minimum, two people on mic (XLRs), I may have more people added in later, but for now, something that will get me working with two people would be perfect. 

I would like to be able to add in computer sounds and/or Skype calls.

That's pretty much it. Pretty basic. I'll be using adobe audition to record and for post cleanup.

I see a lot good/bad things being said about mixers and audio interfaces. I have heard mixers make a hiss when you connect them to a computer via the audio in, but if you use a USB connection you might as well be using an interface at that point. So which is better, mixer with a USB out or just an audio interface?

I have recently been listening to a lot (like, a lot) of the old [CBS Radio Mystery Theater](http://www.cbsrmt.com/) shows, and was wondering if there are any current podcasts that do similar scripted radio show things? I guess similar to Prairie Home Companion but just restricted to mystery/detective (or sci-fi) story type stuff. 

Comedy or not doesn't really matter, the serious CBS ones are so over the top that they end up being hilarious anyway. Take for instance, my current favorite [The Hand that Refused to Die](http://www.cbsrmt.com/episode-146-the-hand-that-refused-to-die.html). 

Thanks in advance for pointing me in the right direction.

My life has changed dramatically and I do not listen to podcasts anymore and I rarely do anything on reddit other than try to prevent posts/comments from getting caught in the spam filter for any significant time.

I request that some people volunteer to keep the spam filter clear. Ideally at least one person would check the mod queue every few hours (everyday year round). It only takes a minute, literally. If this is not done then perfectly good posts or comments can get caught in the spam filter and never see the light of day. I know from experience that this has a very frustrating impact on the community.

Of course you must be a moderator before you can see the mod queue and once you are a moderator there is almost no limit to the changes you can make :) You do not have to do anything and you will have the ability to do many things. Including such things as try to disable the down-vote button (apparently something people have discussed recently).

I hesitate to give moderator privileges to somebody that I know nothing about. Therefore, I am hoping that some people volunteer in this thread and that many others voice their support or any concerns they might have. I intend to leave my name on the moderator list for a significant period so if a new moderator starts causing too much trouble I would be able to remove them (just as the 2 above me can remove me at any time).

------------------

When I became a mod many months ago I had many ideas that I wanted to implement. However, my live has changed dramatically and I do not have time to implement the ideas I had.

If you want to become a mod just to help keep the spam filter clear then fantastic. If you want to become a mod and implement some ideas that you have then I encourage you. If you like some of the ideas that I wanted to implement and you would like to try to implement them but don't know how then I would be willing to try to explain how I was planning to do it.

The ideas that have been started are:

* I wanted a FAQ and fortunately Ytoabn became a mod and he did most of the work on the FAQ. Obviously there is much more that could be done with the FAQ and reddit ADMIN have made some changes to the system so the FAQ probably needs some attention.

* I created the Welcome Survey and I have been surprised at the continuous stream of responses (over 140 in 4 months and more every day) and I find some of the things people say quite interesting.

* I did some preliminary work on the ""Podcasts Actively Promoted"" idea and I am still getting positive responses to the idea (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/10f5c5/if_you_promote_a_podcast_on_rpodcasts_then_please/). One person contacted me and they might be interested in working on implementing this; I am waiting to hear from them as they had some real life issues get in the way.

I run my own podcast and I'm looking for the proper way to cover myself using copyright materials. I'm mainly interested in music, but sometimes I'll need to use a video and/or audio from a particular video.

Are there any free or (reasonable) fee services that I can use that will allow me access to multiple catalogs which I can use safely, as to avoid any legal problems.

I'm slightly familiar with Creative Commons, but that seems like it only covers so much. I'm not interested in walking in a mine field. I want to know that what I use is 100% ok to do so.

I haven't found anything of this nature in my searches thus far, and I've searched Reddit the best I could and I haven't found any recent copyright related questions.

History is presented not as one dry fact after another, but rather as a story that will show how we are all connected. Episode 4 was just released and yes, I'm on iTunes! (which is a big deal to me)
I would be honored if the reddit community came out to check my work! I love making each episode and hope you like them too! Oh and, feedback is greatly appreciated of course. Just, you know, let me down easy if you hate the show. :)

**[How Did This Get Made](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/ylbur/how_did_this_get_made_analyzing_bad_movies_im/)**

---

---

Here's your chance to get a podcast you liked noticed by all of Reddit. Here is how it works:

---

1. Redditors leave a comment with a link to a post in /r/podcasts made in the last week.

2. Redditors also upvote any podcasts in the comments they think are good.

3. At the end of 24 hours, the highest comment will be awarded the Podcast of the Week, and if the moderators agree, will be linked on the sidebar.

---

Here are the rules:

---

**1. YOU CANNOT LINK TO YOUR OWN POST / PODCAST!!!**

I want to put emphasis on this point. In the end most of the posts on /r/podcasts will always focus on self promotion as podcast creators post their own stuff and try to get attention, but I want the Podcast of the Week to focus on Redditors trying out new podcasts. Please, please, please do not use the Podcast of the Week to promote your own podcast. Instead, focus on making good posts throughout the week when promoting your own podcast, and then hopefully a fan of yours will nominate your podcast for Podcast of the Week.

.2. You need to nominate a post that was made in the last week. It is Podcast of the Week after all.

.3. After a podcast has won Podcast of the Week, it won't be able to win again for one month. This is again to try to encourage different podcasts. I'll keep a running list of the winners.

I thought it would be cool for everyone to share/discuss some topics/bits that everyone does on their podcast. It could be a good way for everyone to be exposed to new ideas and also just see what everyone else is doing on their shows. Plus it's a quicker way to check out each others shows without having to listen to full episodes. 

Share clips of some of your regular segments or examples of topics that you enjoy/work on your podcast. Everyone feel free to give feedback on each other's clips. 

Let's see how this goes. I'll start!


**Segment:** Drunk Hotline on [The Everyday Destruction Show](https://www.facebook.com/everydaydestructionshow)

**Description:** We have a hotline that we encourage listeners to call over the weekend after they have been drinking. We go through the drunk dials and play them back and discuss on our show whenever we get a good amount. This week our guest was actually someone who had just left us a bunch of messages.

1376541918.0	1kefpm	Pop Filters and Mics	BrotherShine2	7	1	17	"Hey everybody, I'm new to Reddit and this is my first post! My friend and I are starting a sports podcast in a couple weeks and we're preparing everything in terms of equipment and beginner knowledge of podcasts. We decided to invest in a Blue Yeti Mic that goes for about $119 or so depending on where you buy it. Sound quality is very important to us and I was wondering if we need a pop filter for this mic. We're planning on using the figure 8 feature on the mic (this allows us to speak directly across from each other while sharing the mic) but I'm wondering if we need a pop filter for both sides of the mic? Does this make sense and is it necessary? I would love some feedback as we're beginners in this game...

1376495438.0	1kcr6m	Length of Podcast?	ravenxii	6	2	15	"So my friends and I have been doing a popculture, gaming driven podcast for a little over a year now (http://www.saltpop.net which we re-branded from our initial name) and one thing we can never agree to is the length. At first our episodes were 2-2.5 hrs long and our initial listeners loved it.

After we started promoting more, and establishing a larger fan base we were getting feedback that the episodes needed to be shorter. An hour max. The feedback for shorter was outweighing the longer so we met half way. We originally were doing our podcast in a season format like ""S2E07"" before switching to numbered shows. 

During the 2nd season we shaved off some time, but kept the overall premise of the show the same. We did a huge 24 hour charity event at a local business which garnered us a ton of attention. After that more feedback came in about the length, and how we would drag topics on &amp; on.

So come the third season, we shortened it to 1 hour, and were very structured and time sensitive. Our original listeners, long time listeners have since deserted us minus a few. It's impossible to please everyone I realize that, but I come here to ask have you had any disputes over length? How did you over come them? Were there any factors that you overlooked that I might be overlooking?

1374655238.0	1iy1mc	"""Can you use Dropbox for podcasting?"" I finally have an answer to this"	milliways86	8	3	2	"The answer is **yes you can**, but allow me to explain this further.

### Why the concern?
[Yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1ivo8l/ive_decided_to_change_where_i_host_my_podcasts/) I was talking about how I'm switching from Dropbox due to concerns over their Acceptable Use Policy and the cost.

This all started out from a conversation with another poster on here, who last week said you couldn't use Dropbox for [podcast hosting](http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1igwx0/help_with_putting_our_podcast_onto_itunes/cb4mrti?context=3).

We debated the ToS and Acceptable Use Policy of the service. Apparently he'd tried contacting Dropbox before over whether a key piece of wording over Dropbox's acceptable use, namely:

&gt; You agree not to misuse the Dropbox services. For example, you must not, and must not attempt to, use the services to do the following things.[...] access or search the Services by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping”);

### But does this apply to RSS and podcasting?
So, yesterday I decided - and this is after starting a switch to a new way of hosting my files - to contact Dropbox over this, explaining how podcasters would be using Dropbox to podcast.

Guess what? They got back to me.

Here's how I explained [the use of Dropbox](http://i.imgur.com/lTEvCyO.png) and RSS for podcasting, to Dropbox.

[Here is a pic](http://i.imgur.com/9OZgZZk.png) of the email reply I got back from their support team *after* contacting their legal team by email. And for those who don't want to click:

&gt; Creating RSS links to content you shared would not constitute scraping.
&gt; Looking for content that matches a pattern to find content that you did not share would constitute scraping.

There you have it. 

**You can use Dropbox for podcasting, but there are, as was pointed out last week, one thing you need to keep in mind...**

### There's still limits on use
There is a [daily bandwidth limit](https://www.dropbox.com/help/45/en) on your files being accessed. It is different for free accounts in comparison to Pro and Business:

* Free has a limit of 20 GB a day
* Pro and Business have a limit of 200GB a day

So, if you have 10 podcast audio files hosted on Dropbox and you get crazy amounts of traffic to only one of those files, if it reaches one of the above limits that file and the rest of your files will become inaccessible to those trying to access the link to the file until the following day.

### Am I going to go back to Dropbox?
No. The new provider I've now gone with is a far cheaper option and has less confusing policies in place, however: I now believe that for those starting out, hosting your audio files on Dropbox is a cheap yet viable solution for file hosting.

I'll be including a version of this post in the FAQ once I've finally finished compiling the basics."	t5_2qh1d	True
1374581453.0	1ivo8l	I've decided to change where I host my podcast's audio files (cloud storage stuff)	milliways86	7	0	16	"Episode 50 is approaching and I've decided to take a big leap and change my host and hosting model.

After not finding any clarification on Dropbox over their use of the term ""scraping"" and other parts of their Acceptable Usage policy I'm now hosting my files with another cloud storage provider.

After checking about both AWS and Rackspace, I've gone with Rackspace. Cost, for my needs, is still very low (I'm unlikely to be hitting anything near £5 a month) and their support seems pretty good.

Also - not that difficult to set up and lots of knowledge documents.

Why not something like Lisbyn? (You may be asking.) I didn't want to go with a service like that as I've managed to configure all of my analytics, RSS and website myself. If I want to upload to an additional location, I may consider paid versions of SoundCloud - but I won't make them a default either (their ToS is more explicit about scraping and the like and there's no way that my current set up wouldn't be a violation).

So, anyone else want to talk about other cloud storage providers they're using and experiences so far? Kinda interested to hear form someone who's using AWS."	t5_2qh1d	True

Right now, I'm pretty content with how I have my podcast hosted and tracked. I really don't want to go through a huge process to switch things over, but might consider it if it would attract more listeners. Here are my concerns/questions:

* 1. Is there a charge for join Soundcloud?
* 2. Will Soundcloud just take the episodes off my RSS feed, or will I need to upload everything to them?
* 3. Can I operate Soundcloud separate from my existing set up the way that Stitcher allows me too? I don't want to have to change what I already have set up with iTunes. I did that once before and it messed things up quite a bit.
* 4. Have a majority of people noticed an increase in listeners because they use Soundcloud?
* 5. Anything else I should know positive or negative about soundcloud?

I run a video podcast which is an interview format. There are always 2 people speaking. We use a tascam (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_sNJ6915d4oc/SW-HnLG38TI/AAAAAAAAEfA/cTTDBuNUHLs/s400/tascam+newbies.jpg). I recently got feedback saying that we have the audio channels backwards.

You may remember I posted here a while ago when we were just getting started to get some feedback. Well now we are coming up to episode 7 and think we are starting find our groove. We tried posting this in ""AskReddit"", with little success (I think it was removed as we didn't meet their rules).

We do a podcast called ""Good Friends and Fez"", our podcast is a South Australian comedy podcast that pretty much involves 5 good friends (and Fez) sitting around and having a chat about a variety of topics. How original? We know...however we do try to do some semi-original segments, which in the past have included: 

* ""Fuck off! We're full!"" - where we discuss which country we would send racist Australians to. 

* ""Sunny side up"" - trying to make a positive out of global issues. 

* ""Becreational activities"" - a staple on the show, where a new challenge is set for the GFAF crew to do over the next two weeks (e.g. a past challenge was taking a vacuum cleaner to a dog park) 

* ""Glad-ons"" - coming up with useful add-ons to mundane household items that would benefit the world (items included shoe horns and door knobs) 

* ""4 points of your week"" - as the name implies, each member of the crew rattle off 4 points from their week and whoever has had the worst week gets 3 slaps on the back.

....anyway, you get the picture. However for episode 7, we were hoping we could get some input from the reddit community for segments to do. So guys, what do you think? We realise that we are very new to the podcast game, and our first few episodes were shaky at best. Still we love a challenge, and we think that is something the reddit community could definitely bring it!

**TL;DR** Come up with a segment for our podcast and we will do it on our next episode (episode 7)!

I also love WTF with Marc Maron and This American Life, but as a writer, I'm extremely impressed with Wiretap's host.

1351107880.0	120ubt	Podcast creators: How do you link subscribers to iTunes?	MichaelApproved	6	1	8	"I'm managing the podcast subscription process for the *Keith and The Girl* podcast. One of my challenges is coming up with an easy way for people to subscribe using iTunes.

The trouble I have with iTunes is that it's a multi-step process. If I link someone directly to the iTunes page, they'll have to click on ""View in iTunes"" and then ""Subscribe Free"". iTunes will launch automatically for some but for many it wont. My fear is that people won't know what to do and give up. Another problem is that mobile users can't subscribe from their phones.

I created this page to help but it doesn't solve all problems http://katg.com/itunes
Edit: that page has a little helper graphic on the left which points to the ""View in iTunes"" graphic. Which I hope will focus attention on the next step.

Another option is to use the **ITPC** protocol

    I can't create a link to it on reddit but if you copy/paste the link below into your browsers 
    address bar, it'll automatically subscribe you to the Keith and The Girl show on iTunes
        
        itpc://www.keithandthegirl.com/rss

This is supposed to launch iTunes right away and subscribe someone but the subscription process and download happens in the background. Unless you have an experienced podcast listener, they won't know that they've been subscribed.

So, my question to the podcaster creators of this sub is: How do you link potential subscribers to iTunes?"	t5_2qh1d	True

1348013229.0	103x83	Question: Best (ethical) Way Of Promoting a Podcast?	dbspin	8	2	5	"[This recent thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/1011ox/question_for_creators_are_there_certain_social/) about social networks sort of turned into this question, but I thought it should be asked of the community explicitly. 

What are the best ways of promoting a podcast, outside the obvious stuff of being on iTunes and the other major directories?

We often hear the opinion that good content will find an audience online, but after several years of producing podcasts (both my own and for other folks) I haven't found this to be the case. It seems difficult / impossible to break out of the ghetto of a tiny subscriber base without a celebrity on board, or some form of big media attention. Does this gell with the experience of other folks?

Assuming you make quality work (my shows are all scripted comedy, not improvised chats, with sound effects and original writing etc), is there a way out of this - a way to effectively promote a podcast without spamming, without starting from a large existing fanbase, and without a big media budget?

I usually discover new podcasts on the desktop (through places like this subreddit), and so I want to manage those podcasts on a desktop. 

I used to use Google Listen. It was a brutally simple app, it did pretty much everything I wanted in an almost functional way - it downloaded new podcasts, it played those podcasts, and most importantly for me it would *sync* with Google Reader. 

That is:

1. I could add new podcasts to Google Reader and they would automatically appear on my phone in Google Listen

2. When I listened to podcasts on Google Listen, it would mark them as 'read' on Google Reader. 

I cannot find any other podcast app that has these two features!

I've stopped using Google Listen because it frequently stops playing a podcast for no apparent reason, and it has been discontinued and so won't receive any future updates to fix this. I use Doggcatcher at the moment, and it's very slick and has a ton of features I don't need (I don't care about video podcasts), but it can only *import* from Google Reader - it cannot *sync*.

I used to be part of a no-budget gaming podcast, so I know a bit about the process.  Our biggest issue was actually getting our name out there.

Really my issues boil down to two questions:

1) Where is a good hosting service/site?  We used Libsyn, under the impression that they would help distribute (never happened).  Is there some extra process we should've gone through?

2) Is it possible to use music on a podcast through fair use?  We had no music on our podcast for fear that it would get us into legal trouble.  Is there a way to clarify music's fair use?  Or should we possibly stick to royalty-free music?

1374525367.0	1iu4t9	Question for those who interview a guest regularly	bluepisces	7	4	17	"So, a couple weeks ago I interviewed the guys behind a local company, and they had asked me to run the final edit by them before posting it. I forgot to do so, and had to pull it down shortly after it went live.

Anyways, they have since emailed me to say ""we think the interview is kind of long, a family member listened and checked out half way through. Can you break it into three 20 minute blocks?"".

The entire interview is only 55 minutes long. (and to wit, your family knows what you do, so OF COURSE they'd be bored listening to you explaining something they already know for 30 minutes!)

Fortunately, I was able to compose a very diplomatic email to send back to them to say that I can certainly make the episode a 2 part thing (30 mins each), but that three 1/3rds doesn't really make sense in the podcasting format. If it was a 90 minute, or 3 hour interview, sure, 3 chunks would make some sense. But it's a podcast. They tend to range 30-90 minutes on average, and to really give a good overview/in depth look at an issue or business or idea, I think you need AT LEAST 30 minutes, but the style I'm going for is between suited to 30-60. People who are used to the radio obviously don't have that attention span, but for the ones who do I want to give them a full meal.

Anyways, this got me thinking, I could easily run into this scenario again in future, because organizations DO have a public image to maintain and do have some say in how their information is presented. It kind of reminds me of what Morgan Spurloch dealt with while make ""the greatest movie ever sold"" when the sponsors started to throw their muscle around and he felt he was losing creative control of his project. Obviously this isn't that bad, but the logistics of managing it are such that I really don't want anything to do with it, given the choice. It is an early lesson learned in ""what sorts of organizations would I like to interview, but that the PR gymnastics after the fact might make it not worth the trouble?"".

I kind of think that maybe just trying to interview individuals, from non-profit driven organizations, might be ideal.

**So anyway, the QUESTION** is, have you ever interviewed someone and dealt with something like this after the fact? It kind of makes me have alot more sympathy for radio producers now.

And this also reminds me again why I never aggressively pursued a career in audio/music production, because the constraints on it to produce for mainstream standards just squeeze too much of the potential out in my humble opinion."	t5_2qh1d	True

1373467650.0	1i0d0q	For shows that have gotten listeners outside of their circle of friends, what have you found is the best method?	bluepisces	7	2	25	"I keep thinking about how to reach more people, I am trying to do word of mouth online and promote via social media, and I think there is a very small but perceptible bump from that so far, I don't know if paying for public ads of some sort is the way to go just yet, but I'm not even sure at what point that would be.

I have also noticed that podcasts that have several dozen episodes under their belt also seem to have a bit of an established fanbase, and both of mine are still pretty early in their respective runs. I guess I just need patience and to keep trying to get the word out.

Being such a niche medium, and seeing as how I/we haven't been able to get any really ""famous"" guests as of yet, I guess I feel I am slowly coming to grips with the fact that you can't really force it, if anything that might actually make it worse. Just focus on trying to make the best product you can and tell people about it, and be patient.

The other problem is that there are literally hundreds of podcasts out there, and everyone only has so much time to listen, so you have to be really good to get and keep an audience.

Any tips anyone wants to throw out there for the benefit of everyone? I tried a little trick last week that I found on reddit to drive more traffic to your site, but I found that it only put people on the homepage but pretty much no one actually looks at or clicks on anything (thankfully it was free, but pretty much pointless).

1372008000.0	1gx04y	For podcasts that aren't about one specific thing - what do you most want to hear about on them?	bluepisces	8	3	12	"Alot of podcasts are topic centric (ie comedy, video games, movies, etc), with occasional deviations but usually they focus on the theme of their show.

So, of the podcast that you listen to that don't have a specific theme, what do you most enjoy hearing about? This will help me but could also help others.

For example, I listen to Totally Laime, it doesn't have a specific theme, they just have a guest on each episode and talk to them/ask them random questions, sometimes they end up talking about writing for TV/movies, or music industry stuff (as that is what the hosts do for their 'day jobs') but usually they focus on the guest and what they do, their families/spouses, unusual things that have happened to them, or possibly my favourite - sex. Whenever sex comes up it's always interesting.

So, if you're not listening to a games podcast to hear about games, or a movie podcast to hear about movies, etc, what do you listen to and why?

For those of us who do podcasts that aren't specifically about one thing, this could help us more strategically plan and focus our topics/content. I'm still debating whether or not to incorporate some kind of game or trivia or something into Shit Rick Says."	t5_2qh1d	True

I've started playing around with podcasting recently, but I'm running into a few snags. I think they're entirely technical in nature, and since I couldn't find the answers out in the wilds of Google, I figured I'd see if Reddit has any answers.

I am trying to record a 3 mic podcast using Garageband on a new Macbook Pro.

The mics are USB Blue Yetis, and I've got a Belkin 4-port USB hub since the MBP only has 2 USB ports.

Problems I'm running into after I've created the Aggregate Device in Garageband and then applied each mic to its own track.

-The people running off the USB hub cannot hear the main mix in their headphones, even when they're set to Monitor in Garageband.
-If all three mics are plugged into the USB hub, none of them work.

I'm guessing that both of those are USB power problems? As in I have to plug directly into the MPB instead of the hub, which would them limit me to 2 mics instead of 3.

So, I'm wondering what my options here are. Is there a powered USB hub for something like this? Or is it a bigger problem than that?

In general, is there any other advice that you could give me about working with a setup like this?

Thanks!


UPDATE:

I found part of my solution: creating a Multi-output Device allows me to hear all inputs from all the mics in all the headphones. Just like creating an Aggregate Device, this just works for stuff coming out of the computer, not going in.

USB hub still can't power the headphones of the second mic it shares, but I've ordered a powered USB hub and we'll see if that solves it."	t5_2qh1d	True

I'm beginning to dig through the technical details of starting a podcast and have a few questions.  I am interested in using the Zoom H4n as I will be recording in the field quite often.  When I'm not recording the field, though, I plan on recording 1-on-1 interviews over Skype.  Can I use the Zoom H4n to record myself through one channel and a Skype interviewee through a second channel?  When not in the field I plan on using the H4n XLR jack to connect a better microphone.  I'd like to record on two different channels so that I can easily edit out instances of myself accidentally talking over the guest without losing the guest audio.  Do I need a mixer to do this, or will the H4n suffice?    I hope this makes sense.

In the case of [Nerds Assemble](http://www.nerdsassemble.co.uk), which is edited within an hour of recording (else it wouldn't come out weekly (and none of this is best practice)):

* Doesn't go out live
* Skype call
* One recorder, who's using a Skype audio recorder (software) (me)
* Other hosts connected to Skype on PCs or smartphones with combined headphone-mic headsets (PC) earphones (smartphone)

For our site www.goodatstudios.us we use wordpress as our backbone for the site and use feedburner to create a podcast friend rss feed for itunes.  

The only reason why I can truly say I do it this way is for the listens.  I feel when a user wants to listen to our show they have a one stop shop while visiting our site. We have iTunes Link, RSS Feed Links, HTML5 Audio Player for each show and a direct download link for each show.  This gives a listener full access in different ways to access our content. 

Plus... I only only have to update one title, one show description and one enclosure and it will all be pulled from my site and into any podcast app or the iTunes.  I feel this is more stream lined at least for me.  I hate doing things twice that are essentially the same thing. 

I'll see some sites that are set up for their podcast but don't have anything on there... and as a listener I think to myself... this is confusing that you brought me here but there's nothing for me... now I have to be directed to a different site.

I guess my main focus is keeping my viewers and listeners on my site so they can continue to gobble up content.

We (@MolksTVTalk and I) used to record a weekly Australian Television podcast and one week we joked about how televised Tennis is a thing, who decided that it was a thing, is there some authority on what and what isn't a thing?

Thus, the Thing Committee was born.

The first season was 10 episodes, with 20 guests, 40 ""things"" and over 40,000 downloads - more at http://thingcommittee.com[1]
We've crowdfunded the purchase of a four channel field recorder so we can do a second season on the road.

We're by no means the most popular podcast in the world, but we gave it a go and had a win. iTunes is also featuring us at the moment and Stitcher have been good to us too. We've got ourselves on the Blackberry and Windows 8 stores as well but I'm unsure how we rate on there.

I work a boring 10 hour job so long podcasts are great for me especially one that was as well done and consistent as talkradar so when it was over I wanted to listen to a podcast that was informative, fun, and funny, people recommended the Giant Bombcast so I checked it out and wasn't just disappointed but I feel bad for these guys. I don't hate this podcast, they know their gaming, they get awesome guests, they're informative and they do a good job of creating a mellow and honest atmosphere around their conversations but there is just no joy in anything they talk about. If I had a dime for every time they were asked for their opinion on something and answered only with a sigh and a brief nitpicky summary of their thoughts, I'd be a good hundred bucks richer. I understand these dudes have been in the industry for a long time but their negativity is just overkill, when Borderlands 2 was coming out I remember one of the hosts said he wanted to go back and play the first game to get caught up with the story one of the other hosts just said ""Don't, just don't it's not worth it"" as if he's saving the dude from playing a game that is generally well regarded is doing him a favor, I think the same thing happened with dead space when dead space 2 came out, they make it sound as if playing good games is a punishment, the overall lack of joy these guys express is depressing. It even goes beyond gaming at time I remember they were hating on shooting videos on DSLR's for a good 10 minutes in one episode for no real reason, these dudes are game reviewers on a gaming podcast but they just HAVE to hate on something for the sake of it, I'm an amateur filmmaker I shoot on DSLRs it's personal sure but it's just annoying how out of the way they go to be negative. I might check back every now and then when I have a large chunk of time to kill, I just wish there was another long game podcast that is both critical and fun."	t5_2qh1d	True

Huge fan of Joe Rogan's podcasts, but I'm nearly finished with all the ones that sound like they interest me.  Any similar?	ReppinDaBurgh	5	2	19	"Just recently got sober, was drinking heavily for years.  So now I have an extremely difficult time getting to sleep at night.  Like to toss a podcast on the headphones and listen to it until I am calm enough to drift off to sleep.

I am a huge fan of Joe Rogans pod casts.  But not so much when he has MMA fighters or Comedians on his show.  I am a fan of MMA and Stand Up Comedy, but that's just not what I am looking for to get me in the mood to sleep.  I like shit that puts me deep into thought and gets me distracted from my day to day thoughts that are constantly rolling through my head when I lay down to sleep without listening to anything.  Shit talking about Space, History, Philosophy.  Nothing to outrageous, I like how Rogan keeps it pretty simple and breaks shit down into laymen's terms for his listeners after his guests go way out there with some shit, Rogan brings them back down to Earth a bit for his listeners.

But I am pretty much out of Podcasts to listen to of his.  I have one last one that I started last night that I have about 2 hours left that I will probably finish tonight when I go to bed.  But tomorrow I am gonna need something new to listen to.  So any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions, keep them coming.  I'll be good to go for months now on new material to help me relax at night and get my mind off of my problems."	t5_2qh1d	True

First - are there any good psychology-oriented podcasts? From a scientific standpoint, dealing with legitimate psychological studies, not pseudo-psych feel-good things. There have been some episodes of Radiolab and This American Life that have incorporated these types of stories, but I'd love to find a podcast more dedicated to psych, especially ones geared towards people who are already in/knowledgeable about the field.

Second, since I'm a podcast newbie, I'd love suggestions for other podcasts, no matter how obvious they seem. So far I've been loving This American Life, Radiolab, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, and Savage Lovecast. After looking through some posts on here, I'm subscribed to Freakonomics, On the Media, Skeptoid, Stuff You Should Know, and The Moth.

Feedback was positive and encouraging

Redditors seem to come to /r/podcasts for 3 reasons:

* to promote their podcast (or one they are associated with)

* to try to find good new podcasts to listen to

* to interact with podcast creators, promoters and/or listeners (to get and give advise; to share opinions)

Some come for just 1 of the 3 reasons, others for all 3.

A few do not plan to come back because of the lack of activity and the large number of un-voted, un-commented promotional links.

Many of those who promote want to learn how to be more effective at attracting new listeners.

----------------

I make no promises about progress on initiatives I am working on; however, the more comments and votes this post gets the more motivated I will be to put in the effort :)

Currently we use a USB stereo mic. it cheep and was for us to start and learn on. Now that we have gotten the flow of the show down and know more about editing I think its time to make the audio better. I have been looking for suggestions and going through review on sights for audio equipment. It seems that a lot of podcasters are relying on extra hardware and not the computers. I was going to go the computer route. I use audacity for recording and editing. My shopping list is as follows:

Audio Technica AT2020 Side Address Cardiod Condensor Studio Mic X2

Blue Microphones Icicle XLR to USB Mic Converter/Mic Preamp X2

Nady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp On Microphone Pop Filter  X2

Samson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser MicsX2

On Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand X2


I am thinking of removing the 2 Blue Microphone Icicle Converters and using a Peavey PV6 USB Mixing Console instead. This would allow for expansion and for in room guests (and get extra microphone).

--------------------------

I suspect I am at the very extreme because I have been listening to an avg of 7-8 hr/day every day for several years (some days 0 hrs, some days &gt;14).

I use an iPod Classic and sync to iTunes. Initially I was spending significant time finding the podcast then finding the episode. I was frustrated by not being able to remember which episodes of which podcasts I had or had not listened to. This was impossible while driving and extremely undesirable in general.

So I set up several smart-playlists. I set up 10 playlists where my most favorite podcasts go in the first playlist, next favorite in the second, etc. The playlists are configured to only include unplayed episodes. Every time I sync the iPod with iTunes my playlists are refreshed removing those that  I have listened to and adding new episodes that have arrived. Consequently, a few easy clicks and I am listening to the latest episodes in priority order.

1345757377.0	ypulu	/r/podcast configuration: self posts only or the current any (links or self posts)!!	paul57	5	1	8	"TL;DR: it stays **any** (links &amp; selfs) for now. If you care then read what I say below and comment! Please :)

----------------------

As moderator I want to facilitate and encourage the /r/podcasts community to flourish. I do not want to restrict and dictate or do anything else that might stifle the community. Please remind me of this if I behave inappropriately.

This is reddit, where community members are given the upvote, downvote, and comment features to try to influence other community members. At the end of the day, any redditor can create their own subreddit and configure it which ever way they want. I might even subscribe to your subreddit and actively participate!!!

-------------------------

I am aware of the following objections to **any** (links or selfs):

* Podcast promoters can (and do) dump a link to their latest episode or website with no further information. Most of those posts do not seem to receive any votes (up or down) and no comments. Why do the promoters bother? Why would the community want these kind of posts? Its annoying!

* Unlike other subreddits, links in /r/podcast might point anywhere on the web. There is increased risk clicking on arbitarty links especially when there are no upvotes. You can not rely on the moderators or the spam filter to protect you from the possibility of clicking into very bad websites where evil lurks and visitors wish they had gone to /r/nosleep instead.

* Why can't they be forced to use self only because it is trivial for them to put their link in the self text area?

-------------------------

I am aware of the following objections to **self only** (no links):

* Podcast creators would rather spend their valuable time creating amazing podcast content. Link posts are much easier. The link points to a huge amount of information to help people who might be interested in the podcast. Taking the time to make a self post and include information that attracts potential listeners has not helped in the past. And what reason would they have to think that it would help now?

* This is reddit. If you don't like link posts then ignore them. If you want to get aggressive (and some might say mean) then down vote link posts into oblivion. Why should you be able to dictate what others can or can not do? Go create your own subreddit.

-----------------------

Perhaps I can try to manipulate you. I fear that this issue might polarize the community. I'm loosing sleep over it. I have a huge water blister on my foot from pacing back and forth trying to figure out how to deal with the crucial issue. My wife is about to leave me. My mistress says that I don't get her off any more. I can't focus on pictures of attractive images so my internal plumbing is plugged up and it is starting to stink around here. But worst of all it is taking all my attention away from working on the sidebar FAQ, surveys, etc which is what I would prefer to be doing. I would hate to have to resign as moderator. &lt;crickets...&gt;

Is the community going to help me out or punish me? (BTW most of the above paragraph is false, only the mistress part is true :)

Myself being a dude interested in gaming, listens to the indoor kids and the nerdist podcast (same network) ... Indoor kids is pretty down to earth.

Another my partner listens to is Ben glebb ... I tried listening but couldn't get used to a one man show ... 

I used to be an avid listener to joe rogans show but just kinda stopped... Dunno why.

* You can get up-to-the-minute segments from many popular music and news stations (NPR, BBC World Service, PRI, MPR: The Current, Idobi Radio, etc).
* You can share the radio segments over FB and twitter (clumsily at the moment).
* You can mix and match shows into a custom RSS feed.
* You can get shows before the podcast is released

I need some beta testers to help me find errors and suggest features. Hopefully you,

* Listen to podcasts on your smart phone regularily for more than 30min per day.
* Enjoy public radio
* Give constructive criticism
* Maybe even know a little web-dev

I've been listening to podcasts for years, and I need some recommendations for some new listening material. Between stopping listening to the majority of gaming podcasts, Low Budget FM ending, and recently cleaning my iTunes out of podcasts that don't update anymore (YLNT is sorely missed), I'm basically out of material to enjoy.

I'm 19, a computer engineering major going to school in Boston. I'm gay, I like books, movies, vegetarian cooking, drugs, and humor. Any podcasts related to these things would be spiffy.

I currently listen to: The Comedy Button, The Comedy Mixtape, Doug Loves Movies, Far Out!, Fast Karate for the Gentleman, The Geekbox, HAWPcast, Megaboom!!, The Nosleep Podcast, Wait Wait, Savage Love, To Kill a Podcast, Yeah It's that Bad, and 40s and 20s.

This may seem like a lot, but I listen to podcasts nearly constantly, and I have trouble maintaining a healthy amount of listening content from day to day. Do you have any suggestions for shows I could check out? Thanks.
