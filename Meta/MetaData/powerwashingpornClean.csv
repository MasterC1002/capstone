1373928162.0	1idefp	[Mod Post] Rules reminder	caindaddy	33	11	21	"Huge amount of new subsribers recently means it is time to remind everyone about the posting rules.

Here they are, from the sidebar:

***

**Submission Rules**

 * *Include the resolution* **in** **[brackets]** *in the title.*


 * *Do not submit a shortened link using a URL shortener like tinyurl.*

 * *Use image hosting sites like [Imgur](http://www.imgur.com), [Minus](http://www.minus.com) or another approved host if possible.*

***

A LOT of great submissions are being removed because they don't follow rule 1. So make sure when posting you include the resolution in brackets

Also have seen memes, those are just not allowed, this is a subreddit for pictures of power washing progress or before and after pictures. Nothing else. I am adding new mods so these rules will be enforced much more than in the past.

Other than that, THANK YOU ALL for being interested in the sub, I can't wait to se it grow more than it already has.

If your post has been removed for breaking the rules, feel free to resubmit it.
