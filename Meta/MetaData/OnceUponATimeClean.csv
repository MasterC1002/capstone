1367347990.0	1dff4t	[Speculation] The reason Season 2 was/is so unsatisfying...	mouldy_cookie	68	10	32	"So obviously this show has been going downhill ever since about one third into Season 2. People here and on other pages have been complaining at length about breaks, bad writing, inconsistencies and the lack of an overall story arc.

Now while the first point isn't the fault of the creators, the last point got me thinking... I think this is really the major problem of this season. Adam and Eddy keep insisting in interviews that in Season 1, the plot was about breaking the curse and Season 2 is supposed to be about ""how people cope with the curse being broken"".
That last part always struck me as BS. I'm sorry, but how is ""people coping with day to day life in a small town in Maine"" supposed to keep viewers enjoying the show? That's just a bad idea for a story arc.

And then I remembered... Colin O'Donoghue was promoted to series regular in Episode 9, but we haven't really seen that much of Hook since then. The reason? Colin broke his leg and apparently so badly that he couldn't keep filming.

So what if the creators intented to have a major Hook storyline all the way up to the finale and couldn't go through with that because the actor became unavailable halfway through shooting this season? Hence the often sloppy writing (they had to improvise and rewrite) and the feeling that something is missing in the plot.

Please tell me if you find my theory plausible or too far-fetched, I'm really interested in your opinions."	t5_2srt7	True

1352110722.0	12ntrd	Who is Neal Cassady? [Spoilers] [Speculation]	variablestar	64	4	67	"You know, I subscribed to the theory that Neal was Baelfire very strongly until this episode. I now believe that Neal is the White Rabbit.

Firstly, ""Neal Cassady""-- as some other people have pointed out, the real life Neal Cassady was a major figure in the psychedelic movement, something that parallels Alice in Wonderland.

Secondly, the watches: what other item characterizes the White Rabbit so strongly as the watch? A very important corollary: he is ""late"" to a ""very important date"".

Thirdly, he precipitates Emma's ""fall down the rabbit hole""-- she follows him into a life of crime, and eventually he leads her out, but has to leave her to do it.

Fourthly, stolen from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnceUponATime/comments/12naf9/coincidence_or_impressively_detailed_set_dressing/), we see one of the keychains says ""Alice."" The one underneath it says ""Henry,"" so we can safely assume it's not a coincidence. In his apartment in the first episode, there was also a sign that said ""The March Hare"" or something along those lines.

Fifthly, Emma asks, jokingly, something about ""Neverland."" I think this is the writers' way at hinting at the fact that he's not from FTL, but from Wonderland!

It would also make sense for him to be the White Rabbit. In *Alice in Wonderland*, the White Rabbit can travel in between worlds. This is clear from the fact that he exists in both Wonderland and Alice's world. Maybe he got trapped when the curse hit? It also makes sense to me intuitively that the White Rabbit would not be able to function well in the real world. All of the cursed figures were fine because they had memories of their cursed lives, but for someone who doesn't belong to a world to get stuck in it must be horrific. A lot of the social and other necessary skills we need to get by in the world we learn growing up; look at the two characters who have been exiled to our world, August and Neal. Are either of them well-adjusted adults? No, not particularly. They never learned the skills necessary for survival.

One thing that dissuades me from this theory is the fact of his age... He doesn't look much older than 30, and the curse had been in effect 20 years, so that would place him at ten when the curse took effect...unless he never aged, because he was affected by the curse even if he wasn't trapped in Storybrooke?

It's clear that he knows about magic. The look on his face and the hesitation when August asked him about it. The fact that whatever was in the box convinces him. Now I just want him to fight to get Emma back, something the writers said would happen. I was sketched out by this at first, but now I think I'm okay with the direction they're taking it.

Anyway, thoughts? I think this is viable. Now it just calls into question, who is Baelfire, where is he? Will the favor Rumple calls in be finding him? Will we ever see him?"	t5_2srt7	True

But before he can kiss her, he's going to have to woo her again and get her to fall in love with him all over again.

The thing is, once he does that - true love's kiss will undo *both* curses - Belle's loss of identity due to the remnants of the curse at the town line, and Rumple's existence as The Dark One, effectivel ""undoing"" him.

1367232669.0	1dbwzx	[Spoilers] Even more Tamara &amp; Greg theories herewithin	muppetsrawesome	48	6	12	"After watching last night's episode, doing some research, and seeing the 10 minute leak of next episode my theory on Tamara is growing even stronger. 

Here's what we know - Tamara is not magical the producers flat out told us, she is 100% human.

What they fail to tell us is if she's a literary character or not. 

A while back I posted some Fan Fiction that Tamara is descended from the Van Helsing family. Van Helsing's are a Catholic family who consider magic to be unholy and have chased after Dr. Jeckyll, Warewolves, Vampires, and the like. 

With Dr. Whale/Frankenstein from a universe that is not Storybrooke, Wonderland, Neverland, or Earth we have a link to that realm. We also know that Frankenstein has a bigger role to play in the Finale from several spoilers released. 

My theory is that Tamara is/or works for the Van Helsing family. Similar to Grimm's but allow us a family of monster hunters without touching on their turf. I say they recruited Greg Mendell - him and his father being a shout out to Tron (Produced by Kitsis/Horowitz) as well. 

Here is several more connections to prove it's not as far fetched as it sound:

Disney own's Marvel which has Rachel &amp; Abraham Van Helsing as character's in their comic books. No where in any story are the Van Helsing family consider magical, but magical creature hunters. 

Secondly in the world of Horror literature Tamara Thorne is a famous author. She won the Bram Stoker award for her first novel. 

I think and I would argue that Kitsis/Horowitz gave a nod to Tamara and created Tamara, the granddaughter of a Van Helsing.

1363710572.0	1alma8	[spoiler] A few thoughts on Welcome to Storybrooke	banksnld	47	6	16	"Firstly, I was rather intrigued by what almost seemed like a throw-away line from Rumpelstiltskin, when Mary Margaret asked him how he lived with himself.  He replied, ""You tell yourself you did the right thing.  If you say it often enough, one day you might actually believe it.""  It adds some further complexity to his character - if he had to do this, it means even as the Dark One he wasn't completely lacking a conscience. 

Secondly, while not addressed directly either way, I got the impression that Mr. Gold did *not* own the town at that point, which makes me think that it's somehow wrapped up in how Henry arrived in Storybrooke.  For that matter, I thought they had said this episode was going to show us how that happened, not just why.

Finally, Mary Margaret talking about the bird, ""If you love them and they love you - they will always find you.""  I couldn't help thinking that must be why David is such a bird brain. :P

1369096441.0	1eqcnx	What was your brilliant theory that turned out to be wrong?	curiouschick75	41	4	51	"Speculation is already well under way for Season Three, but I'm curious about what pet theories people have had that have turned out to be wrong. I'll start with mine:

1) Charming: I was sure that there was something significant to us not knowing Charming's real name. Remember waaay back, in the very first episode (or possibly it was the second), when Snow and Charming went to see Rumple? He wanted them to give him their child's name in exchange for information. Snow agreed, they got the info, and then started to walk away. When Rumple asked about the name, Charming wouldn't tell him (""It's a boy""), but Snow did. I was sure, absolutely positive, that Snow had no choice but to tell him because Rumple knew her (Snow's) name, and thus had power over her. But Charming could have gotten away with not telling him, since Rumple didn't know his real name. Something similar came up early this season (I don't recall the details) when Rumple and Charming agreed to stay out of each other's way and not interfere with each other. Again, I thought Rumple had no power over Charming due to not knowing his name. But obviously, I was dead wrong, since Charming's name is David. 

(Side note: I'm kind of annoyed that they haven't done much with the whole ""names give him power"" thing)

2) I thought Charming was King Arthur. Didn't have a lot to back it up, but I was sure I was right.

3) Before we knew that a) Tamara was ""her"" and that b) Greg and ""her"" are bad guys, I thought that Greg's ""her"" (I'll just say girlfriend because that part I suspected and at least got that right) was from Fairy Tale Land. In my head, the backstory was that Greg had met and fallen in love with a woman who had confided in him that she was from another land. She had somehow ended up in this world, but not in Storybrook, right around the time the curse went into effect. (How she didn't end up in Storybrook, I don't know...magic, I guess). Anyway, she was adopted or whatever, and had spent her whole life trying to convince people (adoptive parents, friends, etc) that she was from another, magical land. And no one believed her, until she met Greg. Even though there was no reason to believe her, he did. And then, one day, he ended up in Storybrook. And he saw the magic. And he knew that he had finally found the rest of the people from his girlfriend's land. So he was calling her and sending videos in order to show her that he had found what she'd spent her life looking for. I cannot tell you how excited I was to find out who she was and to see her emotional and touching reunion with her loved ones, whomever they turned out to be. I have no idea where I got that theory from, other than I was really, really hoping that Greg would not turn out to be the bad guy that he clearly is.

4) I was also sure that Greg Mendel was a scientist and was going to help somehow with growing the beans. To be fair, you can't just name a character [Greg Mendel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) and not expect people to jump to some conclusions.


So...let's hear some more debunked theories!

-There is already a lot of speculation that she is a yet un-revealed major player who pushed for the creation of the Dark Curse (she gave Rumpel the idea after all) and who is also involved with the ""Home Office,"" giving the HO a source for all that info they just happen to have on Storybrooke and the fail safe. 

-She's certainly old enough, having been involved in the events that led to Bae leaving the Enchanted Forest and eventually ending up in Neverland. (And really who's going to waste the last magic bean in known existence on one boy's wish; she really wanted Bae and/or Rumpel out of the Enchanted Forest)

-Her powers seem really OP. We've already seen her bring Pinocchio back from the dead twice (Rumpel: Magic can do much, but not that. Dead is dead!). She came up with the memory restoring spell for Belle and Sneezy in like five minutes flat. And for someone who said that fairy dust is incredibly rare, she sure has a lot of it. 

-We already know Peter Pan is a bad guy with accomplices in our world. And plenty of the Blue Fairy's actions have been meddlesome and downright distasteful: 1) Already mentioned giving away magic beans, 2) ""Why yes Snow, this enchanted tree can only send one person to Maine,"" 3) Nova and Dreamy, nuff said, 4) what kind of nun uses that much hair gel? 5) Pinocchio's entire existence.

-In the official sequel (Peter Pan and Scarlet) to the original play, Wendy describes Tink as: a silly blue fairy.

-After two seasons we still know nothing of her back story other than rumors that circulated in the trenches of the first Ogre's war that she is somehow the ""original power."" Just about every other minor recurring character from Season 1 has already had their origin story. "	t5_2srt7	True

Rainbow_Duck	44	4	42	"I have to say, one of my biggest disappointments is how they hired Meghan Ory (Ruby) as a regular, yet she's done absolutely nothing. She had one episode centered around her, but the rest of the time she was either the woman who smelt people or the woman who looked after Henry when everyone else went off to commit murder and stuff. Such a waste of her character as she had really good presence, and such a good relationship with Ginnifer Goodwin on screen.

What I've loved so far is the characters, plainly. I've loved seeing Emma bond with Snow and Charming, Rumpelstiltskin steals absolutely EVERY scene he appears in, and Hook has really good flair, even though he had to be cut short due to the actor breaking his leg. 

I loved how they actually had the bravery to break the curse and explore outside of Storybrook. I always wanted to see the effect Storybrook had on the outside world, and I was so happy to what had (and what is) happening. The CGI and fairy tale clothes have really improved as well, I love how designed the outfits are in this show. Mulan's armour was just amazing.

That whole conversation is exactly what their characters are about. I don't need them to verbally state that.  I feel like the writers are treating the viewers as idiots and I take offense.

Dialogue:  This episode took the cake with idiotic dialogue and poorly written lines.  David's ""The beans are gone!"" after we've just seen a burnt field of beans. Really?  Why can't we say, ""Someone destroyed them!"" ""Regina must have found out..."" Something. Then we have the anti-climatic ""I'm not telling you,"" from Greg.  What a five year old line. I expected him to put a finger to his nose and blow a raspberry at her.

Sloppy Writing:  Hook randomly finishes his duel with Maleficent and is back at the top again?  If that can be explained thanks to Tamara and Greg, do it!

Some of my favorite parts of this show are the flashbacks to full-power Dark One/Rumple, so the idea of seeing a Dark Rumple unleashed upon the poor powerless folks of modern day Storybrook is incredibly appealing.

1350459823.0	11mckq	Speculation on Cora/Regina's mother (different than the Queen of Hearts theory) [S02E03 spoilers]	Bee_Kamiya	37	2	22	"I think Regina's mother Cora might be the woman from the traditional Rumplestiltskin story.

She was born of a common family, a deal was struck and she ends up spinning straw into gold for the king after her father lied and said she could. Rumple comes along to strike a deal in exchange for gold and he eventually ends up getting the rights to her firstborn child. This is the part at which OUAT would kind of just run with it. Cora finds a way to trick him into getting her daughter back by making the deal where she keeps her if she can figure out his name. According to Wikipedia, most of the stories don't end with Rumple being banished or killed, in the Brothers Grimm version he just gets mad and leaves.

Really, the main reason I think this is because of the whole ""I held you as a baby, at last we are together as we were meant to be"" thing that Rumple was telling Regina. It makes sense, I think the writers would be able to introduce this fairytale to the story without making it sound too contrived. Additionally, Rumple doesn't often offer free help, but he would want to help banish Cora if she had somehow tricked Rumple into getting Regina back. I've heard people argue that he wanted to help Regina so that she could become the powerful one, but if that was the plan it didn't work out too well in his favor.

The Queen of Hearts argument makes sense, but one of the main points that makes it feel implausible is the fact that the show makes it seem like she's never been a queen and is just looking to live vicariously through her daughter. But hell, maybe she's both of these women. Maybe they'll say the story of Rumplestiltskin happened in Wonderland, I'm sure he could pop back and forth between realms somehow. The woman in the Rumple story ends up marrying the king and becoming queen, maybe something happened and she lost power. One of the arguments against the QoH theory is how she conducts herself, but maybe since she somehow fell out of power she NEEDED to change her behavior in order to weasel her way back into power. She had to make less of a show of killing people and learn magic, who knows."	t5_2srt7	True

Emma was ""spared"" the curse because of magic-infused wood. Pinocchio may have been turned human, but he was still born of magic wood in the first place, and lingering resistance wouldn't stretch plausibility all that far. 

Gepetto ""and his boy"" helped *build* the cabinet in the first place, perhaps they could've fit two children where there wasn't enough material for even one adult.

No counterpart for the boy has been seen in Storybrooke, and he would have aged identically to Emma, and had a similarly hard-knock upbringing. The difference is that he would be old enough to have memories of what happened come curse-time.

Right now the plot is very concerned with Mary Margaret having killed Cora and how that has darkened her soul etc. Our question is- why is Cora's death (the death of an insane and powerful enemy who will stop at nothing to obtain power and destory an entire town's worth of people on her way through a world-hopping conquer fest) the trigger for the spot on her soul when in ""the old country"" Snow and Charming fought in literal battles with actual swords and actual soldiers and surely some of those people died? (I know there was some fancy fairy dust action at some point, but still, it's beyond ideal to imagine that no enemy soldiers died because of their actions.)

1.Neal is Not Bae, but is Baelfire's Son. Our idea behind this is that it would make some sense if Neal was Bae's son because the fairy tale land timeline would line up a LOT better. It would also explain how Neal knows about magic (if he's not actually Bae). Also, if Bae died early on when Neal was a child or if he was committed into an asylum (for talking about say, magic existing) then it would make sense why Neal was orphaned. Personally I really hope Neal is Bae, but I just love coincidence even if it's that ridiculously gift wrapped. 


2.Cora is the Miller's Daughter. Regina's last name is Mills which I think hints at this a bit, but I feel like it's become even more apparent now that Cora has come into the picture in season 2 and they've talked a bit about the fact that Rumple is the one who taught her magic. Especially the last episode with the kissing moment between them ( EW. ) kind of hints at something more. I think they're going to play on the actual Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale in which the miller's daughter ( Cora? ) is forced to try to spin straw into gold, etc., and then the whole bit about the baby being his price. It would make sense because Rumple actually tells Regina when he first meets her as an adult that he knew her as a baby or some such thing? This would all tie in nicely. My boyfriend has a theory that Regina is the love child of Cora and Rumple, but I personally find that too horrible so I disagree with that one. 


3.Emma has the Power to Restore the Memories of Those who Cross the Town Line. This goes back to the fact that Emma has what Rumple calls ""white magic"" - something hitherto unseen and unknown by even those in FTL, but I really think she has the power to restore the memories of both Belle and the dwarf who have crossed the line out of Storybrooke, especially given the whole idea that she's the only one who can leave other than Henry.

A frustrated viewer on storytelling techniques	funkminister	42	6	22	"I really like this show, but I find the biggest similarity between OUaT and LOST is that there are too many main characters with too many subplots that take too long to connect, or seemingly never connect at all. Right now, we have two worlds now where one gets 95% air time and we barely see the other for a whole episode. Character plots are left unsolved for weeks and I often get the feeling of ""Oh yeah, that guy..."" Characters seem to come as they become important and then drop off the map completely.

One of my favorite shows is Battlestar Galactica, which has a lot of main characters in a similar way as OUaT and LOST but I was able to follow plot lines much easier. I never felt as if characters were being ignored until they were needed, and found almost every characters important to the plot. Maybe I get this feeling because both OUaT and LOST use flashbacks consistently, while BSG rarely did. I find it hard to follow sometimes and find myself thinking, in the case of Child of the Moon, ""This happened before this event... but after this event... or was it then?...""

Am I the only one who has this problem? Has anyone else found a solution to overcoming these issues while watching the show? I enjoy the story and want to continue watching but am starting to feel frustrated by the storytelling of the writers."	t5_2srt7	True

1338662150.0	uhgqs	I think I know who Henry's father is...	TheSnowingMelon	37	7	14	"Okay hear me out. First a little backstory that we should all already know.

We know Mr. Gold got Henry for Regina. Mr. Gold knew where Henry was most likely because he was given Emma's name by Snow and was able to track both Henry and Emma at that point.

It was made pretty clear that little is known about outside of Storybrooke by any of the other characters. August Booth came into Storybrooke and absolutely no one knew who he was. So because of this I am going to assume that no one, besides Emma, truly knows who Henry's father is.

**Now on to where everything is completely my own theory**

The writers of this show **love** connecting things together. They especially love connecting things together that we know little about. Who do we know least about then?

I would have to say the first person in this list would be Emma. We know almost nothing about her past in our world. Then after that would be Henry. We do not have a clue where he was born, how Mr. Gold was able to track him down without leaving Storybrooke, blah blah blah. Now most importantly... who is a major character that we know almost nothing about? Mr. Gold's son

[We know that Mr. Gold's son is outside of the curse so it would be pretty safe to assume that he does not live in Storybrooke. Mr. Gold's son seemed like a very nice boy before he went through the portal into our world; however, he was abandoned and probably got really crabby, angry, mean, ect.] (/spoiler) From what we know who does that sound like? Henry's birthfather who Emma does not even want to talk about.

Now I could be wrong, of course, but I believe I am correct because Emma seems to have met this mystery man outside of Storybrooke.
**I don't believe the authors would just pick a random person to be Henry's birthfather.**
Who came into this world and was outside this curse when Henry was conceived? [Emma, August Booth, and Mr. Gold's son.] (/spoiler)
The writers need a way to connect and introduce Mr. Gold's son into everything, and this would be a way.

Well that was long and poorly written, but hopefully everyone gets my point I was trying to make. Any thoughts?

I spend a lot of time looking at this sub-reddit, and some of that time posting my opinion. So, I thought I'd turn to my fellow fans for some advice.

I'm proposing to my girlfriend, if all goes according to plan, next Saturday. The ring is bought, my chest is getting heavy and my stomach is already filled with steel-winged butterflies. Anyone who's gone through this can attest, it's nerve wracking even in the weeks beforehand. I'm sorry for rambling, but I just needed to say how I'm feeling as I type this out. 

We're massive fans of the show. And, like the timeless nickname to their man, she's referred to me as her Prince Charming, which has now turned to just ""Her Charming"". She's my Snow; She's beautiful, courageous, sweet, always trying to do the right thing, and all around the one for me. We've been together for 5 years (since I was in a Senior in highschool, her a junior.) It's really time, I think, for thise proposal.

**All** of that being said, the reason I told you this is because I've been hoping to find a way to get a message from Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas (somehow,) for us to give to her after I propose. Just something sweet, words of encouragement, something extra to show her I'll always do what I can to pull off something amazing for her. Now, I know people would say proposing is enough. However, those who have felt this sort of love, and those who are searching for it, know how you always want to do more. That last amazing firework to end the show. 

I want to show her that I can do more than what's expected. And if I can pull off getting a sweet message, written or otherwise, from the two people that play the characters we compare ourselves to? To make her really know I'll always be her Charming...words can't describe the want for this.

Any suggestions? Any advice? Any help that can be offered? I'm just a young man who doesn't know where else to turn for this sort of stunt...

I know some of us have been annoyed by the Charmings and/but loose ends are annoying as heck. But, could we move away from the Charmings now?

The way I look at it, Snow was the core of the issues in FTL when we were introduced to OUAT. In our world it was Henry...well, Emma, yes, but between Henry finding Emma and now, Henry is kind of a pawn...something like that. This all goes back to Snow and Regina but, again, in our world that came down to Henry.

Everyone is getting more and more related but it seems like the story is moving more towards focusing on Rumple's [side of the] family. The last episode makes me think that and Rumple wasn't even in it!

We still have some things to figure out about Snow and Henry, Emma and Regina still are a part of everything going on but I could see and accept major issues moving away from Snow and Charming. Not sure how long this Dark Snow is going to play out but I think Regina and Tamara (and Rumple, I guess) are evil enough to keep us going.

Oops, forgot about Hook.

Oh, and Neverland. And Robin Hood. And dead Cora.

But, again, I think we could still talk about people in town, Fairy Tale Land, and move forward while putting less of a focus, basically, Snow and Charming.

Charming can still be sheriff and Mary Margaret can...be in Emma's army? Or Regina's soon? Hmmm

I just don't think we owe anything to the series starting out with a focus on Snow and Charming. At this point, I am ok with it being an elaborate back story for episodes to come.

I think the writers could have made much more of a compelling storyline if both Henry's mothers were either corrupted by magic, or starting to be. To me it makes much more sense that Emma would once again try to take things into her own hands and fight fire with fire. 

Since we already know that Emma has magic in her because she is the product of true love, I feel like the writers could have easily explored this route.

The only thing that would have been weird was Emma giving Regina that fake speech about her mother's love.

For having lived her entire life as a ""mortal"" you think she would be a little bit curious as to what magic is and does, but throughout the series she's never wanted to personally give it a try.

* Lovely, wonderful Evil Queen Regina sent everybody to a world without magic. That’s been the whole premise of the show all along. Our world has no magic. Enter the Dragon. Oh lol, jk our world has magicz! The more I think about this, the more it pisses me off. 
* The tazer. Somehow she was able to kill 2 magical beings with it. One of which was made out of WOOD. Puh-lease. 
* The writers suddenly remembering that the blue fairy is magical. And good. Why the hell she isn’t recruited more to help? Who knows.
* August.  We didn't learn ANYTHING new about his character. We already knew he was selfish. This episode felt like a vehicle to write his character off the show. 
* Henry’s acting. Oh … my … god. I seriously cringed when he kept repeating: Selfless, Brave and True. I cannot WAIT for this kid actor to undergo puberty, maybe the writers will have to pull a “Walt” on him and have him get abducted or something. =D
* Next new episode isn’t until April 21st. If it wasn't for the fact that it's going to have some Rumbelle, I don't know if I would even watch it. Robin Hood? Another new character? Ugh -.-

1364063089.0	1avc5c	Something that I just realized has been bothering me about the show lately	siatabiri	40	11	20	"I think what's bothering me about the events of Once Upon a Time is that I've grown up with the repeated message that family isn't about blood but rather about people who care for you, people for whom you care, and about those who try to protect you--and this series is totally subverting it. 

In Once Upon a Time, we're seeing that all the main ""good"" characters are members of one family and most of the villains are from another, or at least the ones who seem like they were born destined for evil had evil or bad parents.  

Regina's mother was Cora, whose father was a **drunk** and whose mother was either dead or seems to not have been around, and Cora had been corrupted by magic ([and removed her own heart](/spoiler)) before Regina was born.  Regina was kind as a youth but forced into bad circumstances because she stayed with her blood mother and blood father for as long as she did.

Rumplestiltskin's father was a deserter in the war and Rumple grew up in his shadow.  Baelfire, his son, was born before Rumplestiltskin was corrupted by magic but after Rumple was dishonorably discharged himself.  Baelfire saw the magical corruption of his father and did a decent amount of growing after escaping the world of magic without his father.  While he grew up to be a criminal (some of the effects of having grown up with his father, I'm sure), he eventually became a good man--partly due to the influence of August, who literally had no biological parents, unless you count the Blue Fairy and/or the trees  from which his wood came.

Now let's look at the most main characters.

Snow's mother was a brat when she was a child but eventually grew up to be a better woman.  This is the woman Snow knew, though she was sometimes a bit naive, and Snow ended up growing up for a while with her Stepmother, who was vengeful for various reasons and corrupted by magic but did not share a bloodline with her.  This woman also eventually killed Snow's father because a) she wanted more power and b) the king didn't love Regina, he married her simply because she had saved Snow White--Snow White, who truly was the center of his world.

""Prince James""/Prince David was raised by his birth mother and his identical twin brother grew up as a prince because he was adopted into the royal family.  While the brother ended up being corrupted due to power, Prince David was good and honorable because he grew up under his good and honorable mother.  He was able to resist most of the temptations of power, though his adoptive father (the King) was power-hungry and somewhat evil himself.  James was unwilling to live up to the expectations of his new ""father"" and has been trying to rule and live in a less corrupted way.

Emma was born to David and Snow White and escaped the curse.  She grew up in our world's foster care system and became a chaotic neutral character, often working outside the law until she made a deep connection with (read: became pregnant by) Neal/Baelfire and was subsequently dumped by him (as a result of August's meddling).  She decided to become more of a lawful neutral bail bonds agent after she gave birth to Henry (and gave him up for adoption) in prison.  

I sort of covered Baelfire before, so I'm going to skip him down here for the most part...

And Henry.  Henry, Henry, Henry.  We really don't know much of him pre-meeting Emma.  After being given up by Emma, he was adopted by Regina through Gold's influence and eventually realized that Storybrooke existed in a perpetual state of constancy.  At one point he called Regina his ""mommy,"" and he either always was or eventually became isolated and was told he was crazy by his mom who sent him for therapy with Mr. Hopper; Mary Margaret was his teacher and gave him a present in the form of the Once Upon a Time book... That's about it.  

In the series we see him as a non-obedient child towards Regina and more respectful of his biological family.  All the real ""help"" he gets is from his biological family--Mary Margaret, David, and Emma-- because he wants to escape his boring, humdrum, somewhat crazy life.  MM gives him the book.  Emma gives him hope that he can have a separate family and a different life.  David eventually takes Henry under his wing and becomes a protector.  Even Neal is becoming something of a more parental figure.  

And Rumplestiltskin is becoming more sympathetic and a more ""protected"" figure simply because he's Henry's grandfather--biologically. 

**EDITED TO ADD:**

**TL;DR**: This series seems to be saying ""blood is thicker than water, and family is made of blood, and your blood relatives are your real family,"" especially for Henry.

Sparkism	30	6	33	"I just want to throw this out there: My rant about this is that this is starting to become something that isn't a ""preview"" or ""sneak peak"", and more of 20% of an episode. Personally, knowing that much ""ahead of time"" just destroys the magic of OUAT where it captures you and glues you to the seat, not willing to take your eyes off for even one second.

Again, maybe it's just me, but my *absolute favorite* part of OUAT is coming here and reading speculations... and building on theories. Not actual canonical ""This is what is going to happen"" And I really don't think that the promoters are doing anyone a favor by releasing this much information ahead of time, leading to potential spoilers and such. Personally, I prefer a 2 minute ""hook"" to make me want to kill near-extinction animals with my hands to make it home on time to watch OUAT... and not a 9 minute ""This is the first 20% of this week's episode.""

The difference is like Rumple telling Charming ""I want you to do me a favor"" and letting the audience wildly speculate about what Rumple wants Charming to do, Vs. Rumple telling Charming ""I want you to do me a favor by putting this egg in the Dragon's stomach, and after that I'll reward you with magic to find Snow.""

First off, she needs to face some justice for killing Graham in cold blood. That has not been addressed at all, and it seems like no one in the show has even made that connection yet since the curse was broken. Do you think Emma will continue to be respectful of her after realizing that?

Second, in the latest episode, she was an accomplice to the murder of Johanna. Sure, Cora was the one who zapped her out the window, but Regina was right there next to her. I was hoping she'd at least flinch or show some horror at that unnecessary killing, but she showed no remorse. She even ended with a snide quip about what being good gets you.

Sparkism	28	4	12	"That's something that comes up over and over again and it's never actually set in stone. We're always shown what happens when good, naive, or innocent characters use magic and how it goes horribly wrong, but there are more instances where using magic ""costed"" next to nothing.

- Rumple blasting fairy god mother into oblivion and stealing her wand. He paid no price.
- Rumple, Regina and Cora's fireballs, teleportation, throwing people out of the way, etc. They are all done at no ""price"" even though they're all individual acts of magic. We could debate the ""scale"" of magic; but at the same time the energy created to be released by a giant ball of fire in itself should be comparable to a large scale spell as well.  Again, no cost.
- Spinning straw into Gold requires only ""emotions""
- True Love's Kiss pretty much plays this to the extreme. It can break any curse at no cost.
- Using Mad Hatter's Hat to travel. In FTL, no price is paid to use it. (Regina back stabbing aside.)
- Ripping hearts out.
- Using water from lake nostro
- Regina brewing a sleeping potion. You could say that the ingredients were a ""price"", but that's not the kind of ""price"" that everyone else has paid.
- In fact, the vast majority of what Rumple/Cora does comes at no cost to themselves.
- Regina's price tends to be the disaffection of Henry, but Henry's a brat and doesn't really love her all that much anyway.
- Using magic beans to travel. The bean itself is the magic, it's not a price.

Then we look at what does come at a price:

- Any ""good"" character wanting to use magic to solve a problem. Especially when they consult Rumple.
- Making or breaking deals with Rumple.
- Regina using/needing hearts as part of a spell, when the spells come from Rumple. (Dark Curse and the spell she got from her mother.)
- Cora's Candle. But remember, everything she knows was taught by Rumple.


What I'm suggesting is that Magic doesn't really come at a price... but rather, Rumple gets something out of it. He sets this ideology in motion as, I would say, a fear mongering, scare tactic to prevent every character from running directly to using magic at the first sign of trouble. When the magic is neutral or beneficial to him, he doesn't collect a price (Emma using HIS invisible chalk to cast a barrier spell) but when it comes to something that involves his plans, he collects heavily (Snow and Charming's hair for love potion for the most molecular favors)

With Cinderella's husband's disappearance, it can be easily said that Rumple set it up because he already knew she was going to cross him. It wasn't so much a price as punishment. He was also ""exactly where he needed to be"" to hide the scroll for Emma to find (to escape Cora's trap).

I could have failed to mention some exceptions, but I don't think ""Magic always comes with a price"" is going to hold unless there is a realistic price paid on the above list where no price was paid to cast these spells."	t5_2srt7	True
1363710743.0	1almil	[SPECULATION/SPOILERS]Once you blacken your heart it only grows darker...	bathtub_jen	27	1	12	"i doubt this is the route the storyline is taking, but i think it would be interesting to see. regina told mary margaret/snow white that her heart will only grow darker. i don't think that necessarily *has* to happen with mary margaret, because she is snow white and supposed to be pure and a representation of true love and goodness. i think she could overcome it. i hope, however, that she doesn't. 

we already saw that snow is not so pure. i think she, while still struggling internally about it, had been planning cora's murder for a while. of course, at the end of ""the queen is dead"" she outright said that she was going to kill cora. in ""the miller's daughter"", snow is on the phone with charming, and she's holding an apple looking quite distraught. she and henry were both poisoned with apples. i think she was already contemplating cora's murder. i think that is why her heart has a spot. she wasn't killing out of defense, it was out of vengeance for her mother. she lured regina with the hope of her mother's love. **love.** the one thing she's always fought for and the one thing she knows regina is desperate for. she didn't just take out an enemy in battle, she was manipulative and malicious. the murder was premeditated.

snow is also easily swayed by what she's told. she tends to believe what she hears. regina told her that her heart will become blacker, and i think snow believes her. i think that bit of suggestion will make her believe she is evil/will become evil. a good old-fashioned self-fulfilling prophecy. there is an episode coming up titled ""the evil queen."" while it most likely refers to regina going back to her old ways, i hope it refers to snow. i would love to see snow as a fighter again. like she was in ftl just trying to survive. fighting for her family and kingdom. and not shy about her sword. i hope to see snow decide to take her rightful reign as queen/mayor/ruler. and i don't think she would go about the most diplomatic means to take back the thrown while believing she's on the road to darkness anyway. i don't necessarily think she'll become ""the bad guy"", but i'd like to see her take a darker path to get what she wants. i don't think she would turn all the way around, rather more like some bad means to get to a (presumably) good end. 

we're supposed to see neverland at the end of the season, and while we don't know what capacity it will be in (present time, flashback, actually going there, etc.) it would be cool if regina viewed snow white as the evil queen and fled from her to neverland.

tl;dr: snow white will self-fulfill the prophecy of becoming darker, doing evil things to take back power in the name of good. regina will flee to neverland. "	t5_2srt7	True

The giants weren't extinct until Jack killed them all with her poisoned sword. Cora and Hook knew about the beans, and everything Cora knows was taught by Rumple.

Spec: Somewhere down the line, Rumple found out about the beans but chose to not use them, and some how managed to tell Cora. Blue had to know about the giants because fairy dust keeps FTL alive. (Dreamy) In fact, it seems like it was close enough if Emma and Snow and Mulan could have just walked there and back effortlessly.

Another theory: the magic well ""bought back what was lost"", so Rumple HAD to have lost magic in order to gain it back. He can't just willingly give it up, thus the dark curse was born?

Then we learned why Queen Eva specifically pissed Cora off.

And then I remembered how many kings we've met:

* King George (Prince James' father, sort of Charming's father)

* King Leopold (Snow White's father, Regina's husband)

* King Midas (Abigail/Kathryn Nolan's father, Charming's father-in-law)

* King Xavier (Prince Henry's father...so, related to a bunch of the characters!)

* King Arthur (just because we've seen Lancelot)

Ok, so through fairytales before OUAT we ""know"" there are different kingdoms but I am just trying to put it together since in this story, all those kingdoms exist together. All in FTL? All in one realm/world if FTL is considered one realm/world?

As for the women:

* We know **Eva** the earliest as a princess, right? When she tripped Cora. So that's a kingdom we don't know about and maybe don't need to know about (no more tangents! haha).

* **Abigail** and Charming were meant to unite King Midas' and King George's kingdoms.

* Cora is the **Queen of Hearts** but that is in another realm/world.

So I'm currently wondering, **What happened to [Cora] and Regina since Regina was born a princess but was forced into a marriage to King Leopold by Cora so that she could become a queen?**

Did I miss something from those stable episodes with Daniel? Regina was still a princess and Cora just wanted her to marry a king so she could united kingdoms and be a queen? Or did Cora, King Henry and Regina fall on relatively bad times and live ok but not regal lives? The OUAT Wiki says he later served as Regina's valet http://onceuponatime.wikia.com/wiki/Valet but before she became a queen. I guess I can't remember seeing them in a castle or whatever, I just remember the stables. And then Regina kept her father, King Henry, with her in her new...queendom. "	t5_2srt7	True
1362999111.0	1a2qnh	[Spoiler] Who is most responsible?	banksnld	30	6	40	"I was thinking about Cora's death, and there are basically three people that had a hand in it:

1. Rumpelstiltskin - he provided the candle to Snow, and told her how to use it, but didn't use it himself.  His reason for doing so was to stop Cora and save himself.  His is *almost* a moral grey area, as he was protecting the few people he cared about, but also did it to preserve himself.

2. Snow - She used the candle on Cora's heart, and tricked Regina into putting it back into Cora - but didn't do the act herself.  Her reason for doing so was to stop Cora, and to a much lesser extent save Rumple.  She had good intentions, but brought them about by very dark/evil means.

3. Regina - She placed the heart back into her mother, thinking it would make her mother love her and stop her mother from her quest for power. I would argue that this is also somewhat of a grey area - her primary goal was to make her mother love her, which is a selfish act.  She did it to get what she wanted, not what her mother wanted.  But she also did it to stop her mother's insatiable quest for power, which she had begun to realize was in nobody's best interest.  Also, she acted rashly - not really thinking through what **could* happen if she put her mother's hear back.

So, how do we apportion blame for what happened?  Is rumple to blame for coming up with the plan?  Or Snow for carrying it out, though she didn't actually kill Cora herself?  Does Regina get blamed at all for performing the act that killed her mother?  Can it be looked at from a utilitarian point of view, since killing Cora would keep the greatest number of people happy and therefore the ends justify the means?

I'm interested in what everyone thinks on this subject.

(Gold had to explain to Belle how to use a gun and Mulan was puzzled by Emma's gun when she was in Enchanted Forrest)

In ""The Outsider"" episode, Captain Hook acquires Belle's gun. He holds it for a few moments until realizing it is a weapon that you point and click with. Now, I apologize if there is an obvious explanation that I missed, but I'm pretty sure Hook shouldn't know what a gun is. The Enchanted Forrest doesn't have this technology so Hook shouldn't be aware of guns. It is a minor detail, but I'd like to know if I'm wrong or something. Sure, Cora could have told Hook about guns or Hook could have learned about the real world while stalking Mr. Gold. But I believe that Hook didn't know what a gun was until he snatched Belle's gun. It took him only a few moments to figure out what it is and how to use it. I'm sure we could say Hook is just smart enough to figure it out on his own, but I would like another opinion on this"	t5_2srt7	True

People have been fascinated with shadows for a long time. In ancient Egypt, they thought the shadow was part of the soul. The shadow also carries a lot of symbolism throughout many stories in mythology as well, about things like duality, and again, the soul. What I find interesting is the folklore use of the shadow which is a “double walker,” or “doppelgänger.” Consider this- IF Peter Pan’s story in OUAT is going to follow it’s origin, Peter Pan is looking for his shadow. SO maybe Peter Pan is looking for his “double walker” a.k.a. his “shadow”? Perhaps that explains why he knows exactly what Henry looks like; maybe they look the same? I guess we have to wait for next season. I’m very interested to see where this is going...

SolarPhantom	30	6	20	"Ok, so what if there is no Peter Pan yet and the shadow (which as we know is Peters shadow) is only that, a shadow looking for a body, a host for it to connect to. What if that shadow needs someone with magic running through there blood to latch on to so it does not get rejected by the body or something. As we know Balefire did not have magic, however Henry does as he is the son of Emma and she has magic. Im gonna go out on a limb here and say that Peter pan is the new bad guy for eason 3. We had Regina for season 1, Cora for season 2 (with the exception of toward the end where we got these new guys who want to destroy magic) and we will have a evil Peter Pan for season 3? Peter Pan is a young boy who is the leader of this group who is trying to find Henery. In the show as of now that group is being lead by the shadow, so the shadow wants Henry to latch on to so he has a physical body, than henry will become the 'Peter pan' character and will be evil as if under a curse. Whial being evil Henry will end up killing Rumple as he said ""the boy will be my undoing"" as the profecy stated. Henery would NEVER kill his grandfather, he is a kind person, but if he was to turn evil and under the control of the shadow, than that could happen. This is what I think season 3 will be centred around, the one thing I don't understand is how they thought Bealfire was Henery, as Henery is the son of Balefire and in the episode Balefire was still a kid, how does that work...

As a young boy Walt Disney was always fascinated by the magical things in life. He's not an orphan, but due to his love for imagination and ""magic"" he is visited by a fairy: Tinkerbell. She takes him to Neverland where he witnesses magic for real. After getting in some hairy situations/adventures with Hook he finds his way out of Neverland and into other fairy take worlds such as Enchanted Forest, Wonderland and even Oz. He's able to go back as forth from our world to these magical worlds through Neverland and magic, perhaps beans supplied by fairies (because of his fondness with Tinkerbell). He decides it's time to grow up and comes back to our world to build his own company, Disney.

After the success of various Disney cartoons like Mickey and Goofy, he decides to go back to the land of magic and decides to start creating his next pieces of work on things actually happening in the fairy tale worlds. He begins with Snow White and her seven dwarves. When Walt Disney is ready to ""pass on"", he fakes his death (pretending to be cryogenically frozen - for insane, rumor's sake) and lives out his life in fairy tale world eventually becoming the all-powerful wizard of Oz.

Now, I know this is all crap. Please, don't downvote me for being stupid. I'm aware this is very, very unlikely to happen, but I would still ind it really awesome to incorporate Walt Disney, himself, into this show literally. Thanks r/OnceUponATime crew!"	t5_2srt7	True

 I believe it was the second episode of season 1, where Regina is getting pissed at Emma. Mr Gold walks into her garden with the apple tree, and it's revealed that Mr Gold assisted Regina to adopt Henry. Their conversation implies that Mr Gold got Henry because he (Gold) noticed that Henry was the son of Emma, so he chose Henry, knowing that eventually it would have led to Henry finding Emma and the curse being broken.
 If Mr Gold had not had his memory at the time of Henry's adoption, he would have no inkling of who Henry is.

3) Birth mother just shows up at school and the kids therapist and they treat her like she is the kids mother, giving her way to much info for the sake of exposition

I watched the first two episodes about 3 months ago, but couldn't really get into it because of the way it was filmed. Something seemed off, maybe it was that no one quite looked comfortable in their clothes, or the clothes was slightly too new and not lived in. Or maybe that the lighting in the real world didn't ever seem to really appear natural, and the lighting in the fairy tale never quite matched what was green screened in, but I feel as though somewhere that shifted.

The story captured me on a day off when I was bored, and I forced myself to suspend disbelief, and do my best to stop watching for the things I disliked. I'm on episode 9 now out of interest in plot and I'm beginning to really enjoy everything's appearance.

This one seems to be the most plausible. Snow's primary motivation has always been the love she has for Charming and for her family. Without that love, will she turn down the same path as Cora did?


**1.) Regina will use Snow's heart to control her and do evil deeds.**
I was thinking back to the episode where Cora/Hook used Aurora's heart to control her.

Thoughts?

They were leading us to believe that Dr. Whale was the Wizard: Jefferson calling him ""the wizard"" after apparently making a trip to Oz; Jefferson and Regina going ""off to see"" Dr. Frankenstein; Frankenstein's Emerald City-style coat and hair. Though I can't decide if that was all a false trail (like August/Bae or ""Leviathan""/Whale/Lancelot) or if he's a dual character (like Rumple/Beast/the Crocodile or Sidney/Genie/the Mirror).

Rumple wanted Jefferson to get the magic slippers (perhaps to go from Oz to Kansas--though would that be our Kansas, Frankenstein's black and white world, or someplace else?). Jefferson failed, but did get Rumple an orb. I'm guessing this was the Wicked Witch's crystal ball? 

So what about the orb that Cora gives Gold in the latest episode? Is it the same one Jefferson retrieved for him? This new one looks a lot bigger than the first one. If they are different, why couldn't Rumple use the first one (and why bother introducing a useless globe in the story)?

Wasn't Cora very definitely bad? I understand that Snow is supposed to be childlike and naive, but she is also supposed to be a Queen, and a grandmother. She might be married to a man who is unsure as to how many grandparents a child can have, but surely she has to see the bigger picture?

And what's the deal with trying to find the good in bad people? I mean many of these people have already killed hundreds of people, so whatever good you find in them now, it's not like you're going to bring back all the dead people, right? If murderers can be good people, should people on death row be set free of they promise to be good?

The previous thread had spoilers in the title, so this is a new one.

One of the comments said that Snow can't justify killing unless in self-defense, but Cora and Regina at first clearly wanted to control Rumple to get him to kill Snow and everyone else, and then Cora herself wanted to take his power, so couldn't it be considered self-defense?

So maybe Neal is a descendant of Bae? At the very least, Neal knows something about magic and the curse (given that he believed August's story with proof from whatever was in August's box).

Or perhaps Bae went to Neverland (like Hook's magic bean took him to Neverland) and thus he stayed young. Of course the bean supposedly took Bae to ""a land without magic"" so that would probably knock out Neverland as an option.

Examples of this that I have enjoyed are: Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz), Grendel (from Beowulf), and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (from Hamlet).

I have been desperate to find a term to describe these types of work and I can't believe I didn't *believe* it would probably be on Wikipedia (which I use all the time, geez!). The term seems to sort of be [parallel novel] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_works_using_settings_created_by_other_artists). Well, it's the best I've got now.

Does this describe OUaT? I was sooooo excited when I saw the previews for the show and I don't think it was because I was so into fairytales (which I don't think I am). I think it's because I knew they would be weaving together stories that didn't quite go together and so have to reimagine characters.

In episode 19 ""The Return"" August starts poking around Mr. Gold/Rumple's shop. This raised Rumple's suspicion so he began to follow August around town. Rumple tails August to the convent where he sees August talking with Mother Superior/The Blue Fairy. After Snow gave birth earlier than expected the Blue Fairy told Geppetto to allow Snow and infant Emma to go through the wardrobe instead of letting Pinnocchio and Emma go. Because Geppetto decided to ignore the Blue Fairy's orders and go with the original plan and she left to ""make preparations"" with the other fairies she had to assume that Geppetto followed her order and that Snow and Emma went through safely.

**W**hen August comes to visit her in Storybrooke as Mother Superior she wouldn't know who he was, even if she had retained her memories somehow. He could have lied to her and said he was Baelfire. From what happens right after that in the forest with August and Rumple it is safe to assume that she told August where to look for the dagger that controls the Dark One. Now, she may not have explicitly mentioned the dagger but she had to have given him some kind of hint where Rumple tends to hide things. A good piece of evidence for this is that when Rumple asks August flat out who told him about the dagger August replies: ""a little fairy.""

**A**ugust tried to use the dagger on Rumple and of course it did nothing, blowing his cover as Baelfire. He should have very well known that there was no magic there. This is something that I cannot understand. It could very well be evidence that this theory is false and that he blew his cover prematurely. But that doesn't explain how he knew about Baelfire and the dagger. Also, I thought it was odd that August called Rumple ""Papa"" just as Baelfire always did. It could just be luck or the common name for one's father back in the Enchanted Forest but it just seems like too much of a coincidence to be luck. Plus, the way August paused before he said ""Papa"" was as if he KNEW that it would strike a cord with Rumple.

**T**he main thing I can't seem to figure out is how August knew about Baelfire. Baelfire was alive centuries before Pinnochio was even born. The only people, that we're aware of, who could have filled him in on Baelfire are Rumple, the Blue Fairy...or Baelfire himself. Since we have yet to see (**FOR SURE**) where/when/if Bael is in the current timeline of Storybrooke we can rule him out for the time being. It is obvious Rumple didn't tell August about Baelfire so that leaves only the Blue Fairy. But how could she have told him unless she retained her memories from Fairytale Land somehow?

**J**efferson also retains his memories of Fairytale Land. Recently it has been revealed that Jefferson also has ties to Rumple to at least some degree but it is unlikely Rumple would have divulged the story of Baelfire to Jefferson.

**T**his means that either the above theory about the Blue Fairy retaining her memories is true and she is plotting against Rumple with the help of August or August is in communication with Baelfire somehow or was at some point in the past before he came to Storybrooke. It's also possible that August, Baelfire and the Blue Fairy are all working together somehow but that seems even less likely and I'm not willing to jump to that conclusion just yet.

**Some Things I Still Don't Understand**

* The Blue Fairy left with the ""other fairies"" to make ""final preparations"" before the curse hit. What the heck does that mean? Could they be hiding something?

* Before the curse was broken August/Pinnocchio could see himself transforming back to wood. How is this possible if there was no magic there? Perhaps it's because he was originally carved from a magical tree similar to the one that the wardrobe was made out of and he just sort of has residual magic lingering inside him?

* Something about the Blue Fairy just does not sit right with me. I get the feeling that she operates behind the scenes and has her own schemes running. Snow made mention that there are good and bad fairies (""Snow Falls"" I believe) so maybe there is more to the fairies than we've been led to believe. I can't prove anything but I am willing to bet that she is behind some huge things.

**EDIT:** Due to a lack of real evidence for the Blue Fairy, it seems that Bae is the most likely candidate of the 3 to have filled August in."	t5_2srt7	True

To be specific, I love that the fairy tale and reality worlds begin to merge - or not just yet. But that's just an expected plot move. What I think is special, is *how* those two worlds merge, and not just through plot, but by how it is portrayed.

The fairy tale world is getting aspects of the real world, like non-blackandwhite acts and feelings, accidents, but also the perception of it being an environment with actual people living there, day to day.

And the real world now has the romantic notions of destiny, honor and magic.

**Following questions:** Why was Regina able to use magic after Emma touched her? What was the situation that came before that moment? Then finally why didn't Rumple/Mr. Gold use any magic just yet?

[Hopefully the correct answers](/speculation) Well Regina clearly realized something at the point that Emma touched her that is clear, but what was it exactly? Well to analyze the episode the only major thing that happened to Regina emotionally was that she realized Henry still loved her and that Emma promised Henry to protect her. Hopefully by this point everyone knows the most important rule in magic? Love is the most powerful magic of them all, but what if love was used in a new way? What if love was used as a requirement for magic? What if the only way to use magic in our world was to have the feeling of love while using it?


* Sorry if this is confusing, but I felt this was the best way to write everything out so it would make sense. I'm simply speculating that magic now requires love in order to work because it answers every question in the most simple way.

* At the end of the episode Mr. Gold told Belle that she should leave because he is a monster. Mr. Gold still loves Belle, but if this theory is correct he is only keeping her around because he needs her in order to use magic. He can't explain any of this to Belle because he really doesn't want to completely lose her love. If she knew that she was just a toy Rumple would be powerless, and he cannot afford that. So he gives her a small window of escape (very small). Mr. Gold wanted to ensure that he had his source of love (Belle/Beauty) before he used any magic.

* Why did Regina's magic start wearing off once Henry walked in? Because Regina's only love in the world is Henry and if Henry loves her she has magic if Henry doesn't then Regina is heart broken and cannot perform any spells.

Now as we all know, Baelfire opened a portal (presumerably) to the real world, and was sucked into it, leaving Rumpelstiltskin behind in the Fairy tale world. Now I was reading this interview with Robert Carlyle (http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/10/17/robert-carlyle-rumpelstiltskin/), where he states Rumpelstiltskins age:

* *He’s 300 years old.*

We know that Baelfire traveled to the real world shortly after Rumplestiltskin became The Dark One, so Baelfire must have gone through the portal at least 200 years before the dark curse transported the fairy tale characters to the real world.

As we saw with Emma and Pinocchio when they traveled from the Fairy Tale world to the real world, time stayed the same in both worlds. The curse was broken 28 years after Emma's birth, and the fairy tale characters were in the real world for 28 years.

Going by that logic, shouldn't Baelfire basically be... Well... 300 years old and dead?"	t5_2srt7	True

The biggest piece I have trouble with is the Ogre Wars.  In the Belle backstory, he takes Belle to stop the Ogre wars.  In this one, he is living in a lavish mansion.  Then when you find the backstory on his son after taking the power of the Dark One, they mention he stopped the Ogre Wars, but he is living in his old house.  

Most likely the truce didn't last, and Belle's father called for Rumplestiltskin, because he calmed everything down before, but I'd still like to see everything pieced together.  If I had the time, I'd do it myself, but I can't see me having enough in the next month or so."	t5_2srt7	True

1332446509.0	r8u40	screencaps for 1x16 Heart of Darkness	crazykoala	19	1	8	"I thoroughly enjoy *Once Upon A Time* for its craftsmanship, subtlety and attention to detail. For a movie or tv show to achieve greatness it has to combine several disciplines: writing, directing, music, acting, costumes, props, special effects, etc. and I think this show is great. I like to do screencaps as a fun way to rewatch the show and pay attention to the details presented on screen. Sometimes one can find things that have meaning within the story, sometimes things are just there for style or to set the mood, and sometimes they are foreshadowing for things to come. Sometimes things go by fast and deserve a closer look, and sometimes it is just a smiling face that someone might want for a wallpaper, so I grab a lot of pics.

I know y'all like easter eggs and I spotted what I think are a couple of Disney references and a number of objects that exist in both worlds. Some composite pics are linked below, [browse the gallery for individual pics](http://imgur.com/a/cqFVA), or get the [archive here](https://www.typhoontools.com/link.php?id=7650-9473-4967&amp;d=1). Let me know if you see something I missed or have a request for a particular scene.

[**You won't like Happy when he's angry**](http://i.imgur.com/74PRX.jpg)  
The dwarf's forest home seems nice and cozy, as long as Snow isn't raging. She broke Happy's mug but replaced it in the end. We saw those mugs before in Mr. Gold's shop in episode 106 ""The Shepard"". We saw candles like those in ep 114 ""Dreamy"". And a bell jar like she traps Jiminy in is seen later in this episode in Mary Margaret's apartment.

[**Mary Margaret has nice knick knacks**](http://i.imgur.com/kqC8S.jpg)  
When Emma goes back to the apartment to check for signs of forced entry she gives us a tour of the room. Mary Margaret has lots of little statues and stuff on her dresser, desk and mantle; 2 fawns that are probably references to Disney's Bambi, what looks to me like a Mary Poppins figurine, lots of songbirds, 5 bell jars, a pic of butterflies (LOST also referenced butterflies), and of course the ol' murder weapon in the air duct.

[**Beware the Magister**](http://i.imgur.com/xFBte.jpg)  
The word ""MAGISTER"" is engraved above the door to the mayor's office. And that heart box on her desk is staring right at me. That box was last seen in FTL during the ceremony that invoked the curse (ep 102).

The Queen likes to ride horses, and Regina has a horse statue on her office mantle, so Magister  might refer to [Magister Equitum, Master of the Horse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Horse). Another possible connection is to a [Dungeons &amp; Dragons book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magister) about creating magical items. Also, the word Magistrate derives from the Middle English word magistrat, denoting a ""civil officer in charge of administrating laws"" (c.1374); from the Old French magistrat; from the Latin magistratus, which derives from magister (master), from the root of magnus (great). Sooooo, she's got *that* going for her.

[**Guard Guard Bear**](http://i.imgur.com/mC6V3.jpg)  
Charming picked a bad day to wear his cape with the bear fur collar. There is something in each corner of this relatively empty room, so what is that mysterious object on the pedestal?

[**Henry has the key**](http://i.imgur.com/v5g1q.jpg)  
I enjoyed August's talk with Henry about how ""you and I have faith, but Emma needs proof"" and to look in his book (it's real stories bro!) to find the key. So is that what August was doing when he rebound the book - he inserted a story about the-boy-who-found-what-he-was-looking-for-by-rifling-through-his-mom's-desk-drawers? Henry did find Regina's key ring and with Emma's help they found a key that unlocked MM's apartment. Henry may have also provided MM the key to get out of jail, tho I suspect that's a setup.

[**Shooting the Queen**](http://i.imgur.com/5kYLO.jpg)  
No particular objects discovered here, just lots of craftsmanship going on in the scene of Snow with her bow and magic arrow trying to assassinate the Queen on a wintry forest road: on location, big crew, lots of extras, snow falling just right, banners flying, dolly shots, guards, carriage, and the Queen? She's on a horse.

[**Just taking inventory**](http://i.imgur.com/lEFHw.jpg)  
That's what Mr. Gold says to Emma when she comes to ask him for help. Ok then, let's do some inventory. We see he still has the genie's lamp that came from FTL. Is that a candlestick shaped like Lumiere? Stuffed penguin like the one in the dancing penguin scene in Mary Poppins? Check. He has lots of picture frames, and we know someone has framed Mary Margaret. :p Two sets of balances for weighing things. (LOST had a famous set of these) A glass flask similar to the ones Rumple keeps his magic ingredients in. A trumpt, an accordian, a wooden steering wheel from an old timey sailing ship, don't know what those are for but, check, check and check. A magnifying glass as seen in the show's opening credits and also in the here and now as we transition to FTL where Rumple, reknowned as the most powerful man in the world, has assembled the ingredients for the, not available in stores btw, previously believed to be impossible, the magic of true love? Checkity-check!

[**Rings and things**](http://i.imgur.com/R7YIP.jpg)  
But what's that globe-like thing in the middle of the room? Glad you asked, but first the rings. We know MM has a ring that Charming had in FTL. (theory coming soon) Mr. Gold is wearing two rings: a simple gold wedding band and a larger more magical looking ring on his right hand. Also, when Regina held MM's hand earlier during questioning, and later when she was peeling an apple with a knife (when David stopped by her office) we got a good look at Regina's ring. Finally, when Mr. Gold is telling Emma that she is more powerful than she can possibly imagine, it is while Emma is leaning forward and the ring on her necklace is dangling there like a hypnotist's watch.

Oh yeah, that globey thing. It's called an [Armillary Sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere). This is old astronomy tech and they come in various shapes and sizes. This one looks to have 9 rings.

&gt; Usually a ball representing the Earth or, later, the Sun is placed in its center. It is used to demonstrate the motion of the stars around the Earth. Before the advent of the European telescope in the 17th century, the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions.

An Armillary Sphere is useful for learning one's position in the world. But instead of having an Earth or Sun in the middle this one has a clock. What's with the clocks in this show?!? That is unusual for an Armillary Sphere. I looked through google images and did not see one Armillary Sphere with a clock in the center. So I think this one is unique and something Mr. Gold is making or repairing. Working theory: Gold is using it to try to physically find a way back to FTL, which is not just another place but another time. Or maybe he just appreciates the value of an interesting object. Hopefully, time will tell.

I don't know how Neal got to our world from Neverland, but for this to be true, Neal would have had to go back to Neverland after ditching Emma in Tallahassee to bring Tiger Lily to our world.

1358755673.0	16z9ry	Bae and Henry's Father Speculation	Kavvybop	18	1	23	"I've been mulling it over and I don't think it's possible that these two are the same people, despite all the hints making us think otherwise.

If Bae was 14 before leaving Fairytale land (the [wiki](http://onceuponatime.wikia.com/wiki/Baelfire) mentions Bae was fourteen for the Ogre Wars), and the curse was enacted at a later point when Emma was born, then that means Bae is more than 14 years older than Emma is at this point (since he would have travelled to our world and thus would not have been affected by the time issue the rest of FTL was dealing with, like Emma). Yet if Neal (Henry's dad) and Bae are the same person then that wouldn't make sense since Emma and Neal were a lot closer in age when they met (about 6-7 years based on the [wiki page](http://onceuponatime.wikia.com/wiki/Neal_Cassidy)).

So if this is the case, then that means that there's a 7 year gap 
that's unaccounted for. I can't really think of a scenario where Bae goes from being 14 years older than Emma to 7 years older than Emma. He wasn't affected by the curse because he was outside of FTL and even if he was, then that would mean he would now be 14 years younger than Emma, which obviously isn't the case.

So then that means that Neal isn't Bae. And yet all the signs seem to be pointing to those two being one in the same, what with the globe pointing close to New York in last night's episodes, and all the trinkets inside of Neal's house. 

The only way it works is if Neal didn't go to our world and was instead in another world without magic for ~14 years, and was then affected by the curse (in the same way Dr. Whale was), but wasn't sent to Storybrook. Then that would mean that anyone in Neal's world (a place without magic) was sent to New York, and time stood still in New York. But again, that doesn't really make any sense. So that would mean that Neal isn't ACTUALLY in New York, but some place similar that is close to New York since that's where the globe pointed Bae to be.

I'm getting a little lost in my own thought here, but the point is that if Neal IS Bae then there's some stuff that needs to be addressed, like the strange time gap (which is unlikely to be addressed since no one seems to have noticed). I remember people thinking of scenarios where Bae was Peter Pan, which would be interesting. If he was in Neverland for ~14 years dealing with Hook then that could tie into the story VERY well. But that would mean that Bae had to have been affected by the curse, so when he met Emma he never actually aged.

Side Note: Tinkerbell uses fairy dust, which I believe is the only ""magic"" in Neverland. I thought it was addressed somewhere that fairy dust isn't magic, but it's own thing (ie Regina and Rumple don't use fairy dust to do magic). Hence Neverland not being a land of magic."	t5_2srt7	True

Yes, there may be some speculation on this and I have read the rumors, but there can only be one explanation for this to possibly happen. Here is my theory: 
    Bae went through the portal to a land without magic. He was at first upset with his father and then tries to find a way back. I'm thinking some whole thing with the fairy Dreamy liked could come into play as Tinkerbell or something, and she travels to the other realms and finds Bea or somthing. 
    Anyway, this is my theory if they every say that Bae could ever be Peter, which I find is highly unlikely. It could be possible for him to be a lost boy, but this is also unlikely as he was sent to a land without magic. A huge blow to Rumpelstiltskin is if Bae is not even in the Storybroke realm at all, but in another, such as the world Frankenstein lives in (which also doesn't have magic) I'm just thinking Bae will be in like his forties and will be shown by the end of the season.

In the mausoleum the camera focused on Regina's family name, Mills, several times. This lead me to think of the original story of Rumplestiltskin, where the miller tells the king that his daughter can spin straw into gold. The king locks up the daughter and demands that she produce gold. Rumple shows up and bargains with the daughter, in exchange for spinning the gold, eventually receiving her promise of her first born. The king marries the miller’s daughter. When their daughter is born, Rumple shows up and demands his payment. The queen begs him, and he finally agrees that if she can guess his name, she can keep her daughter. One of the queen’s men is able to spy on Rumple and discover his name. When the queen reveals it, Rumple rips himself apart.

What if: 

1.	The queen/Regina is the miller’s daughter
2.	The king in the story of Rumplestiltskin is Midas
3.	Their daughter is Abigail

Midas is obsessed with gold. He hears of this girl who can spin straw into gold and kidnaps her. Rumple comes in and does his thing. The miller’s daughter (evil queen) makes the original bargain with him but messes up with the second bargain. Maybe she wasn’t supposed to cheat on finding out his name. Whatever it is maybe she has to leave Midas and Abigail behind, and that is how she ends up with Snow’s father. And maybe Snow finds out about this and that is the big secret that caused the problem between Snow and the Evil Queen. It would make sense that this would be the sort of secret that would allow Snow to be sympathetic toward the Queen. She sacrificed her family to keep her daughter away from Rumple. 

Am I rambling? Does this make any sense? Does anyone else think the CGI is atrocious? :) Seriously interested in further thoughts…

And, if it is, how do you know where the beans will take you?  When the Blue Fairy gave Bae a bean, how'd she know the bean would go to our world?  Yes, the bean travels to different worlds, but are there only two worlds to choose from--ours and FTL?

No spell was cast on the bean that Tamara threw before Bae fell into it, so where did he go?  Can we assume he is in FTL?

1366151419.0	1chpxn	[Speculation]The Blue Fairy	banksnld	19	3	6	"There's a theory floating around that the Blue Fairy is the Big Bad of the series, pulling the strings for her own ends.

But say she is pulling the strings - what if her motives are still good?

We already know she predates Rumple; what if she were there when the first Dark One came into being?  

It could have been intentional by some third party, either something besides a fairy or another fairy gone bad.  ""OH NO! SOMEONE TURNED THAT POOR SCHMUCK INTO A TWISTED SOUL WITH IMMENSE POWER IN DARK MAGIC!""

It could have been accidental, caused by a third party, another fairy, or the Blue Fairy herself.  ""Let's do X to make the world a better place... OH NO! IT BACKFIRED, AND I'VE TURNED THAT POOR SCHMUCK A TWISTED SOUL WITH IMMENSE POWER IN DARK MAGIC!""

It could have been the law of unintended consequence of some act by a third party, another fairy, or the Blue Fairy. ""Let's try to imprison all dark magic to make our world a better place... OH SHIT, WE JUST TURNED THAT POOR SCHMUCK INTO A TWISTED SOUL WITH IMMENSE POWER IN DARK MAGIC!""

The first two could also open the possibility that the creation of the Dark One corrupted a world that had been pure &amp; good before the creation of the first Dark One.

So what if she is pulling the strings, but her goal is just to create a world where *nobody* has the power of the dark one anymore? 

We could already say she made one attempt at this, when she gave Bael the magic bean - if Rumple hadn't chickened out, that would have been the end of the Dark One.

Hmm... one other idle thought for a possible theory.  What if, like the Phoenix power/entity in the X-Men comics, the power of the Dark One has a sentience of its own, and influences the actions of its host to ensure its own survival?  What if the ultimate struggle ends up being against not the Dark One or any other Big Bad, but the Dark One's power itself?

edit: Or what if said Power of the Dark One is looking to extend its influence over all worlds?  A curse that would take his host to a world without magic that lets his host exist in that world and wield magic after said curse was broken would seem to further that agenda."	t5_2srt7	True

She gave Cora the dagger to spare JoHanna, when she knew what Cora was planning to do with the dagger, hell, Cora said it verbatim. So why the hell hand it over to save one friend.

1367350701.0	1dfiyp	Discussion: Why didn't Rumple just set up Bandit!Snow and Shepherd!David on a date?	thisfreemind	16	1	5	"I know, I know--easy answer: because that would be a boring show.

But seriously, why couldn't he have just introduced Snow and Charming from the get-go? After all, their only major significance in his plan to get back Bae was: baby Emma, their hair-love-potion, and Regina taking revenge on Snow. Somehow with his prophecy powers it made more sense to create an elaborate scheme involving bankrupting a kingdom and prince-swapping and all that? He couldn't just send them on a nice date, while he made the curse for vengeful Regina?

They meet, they find True Love, they have Emma, Rumple grabs some hair along the way, Regina's still PO-ed so she sets the curse, Rumple works whatever deal he wants for comfort in Storybrooke until the curse breaks. All that could have been achieved with the simplest of meetings between Snow/David instead of all this complex kingdom-level scheming.

But I suppose a possible explanation is that Regina had to be at her greatest point of desperation to finally enact the curse, which only occured after she lost a full-scale war. And perhaps all the royal scheming gave Snow and David a fighting chance against the Queen? In which case, criminy Rumple, you plunged the realm into war because you didn't want to enact the stupid curse yourself?!

Crap, now that I think about it, he could have just used Milah's heart to enact the curse. ARGGG!!! Rumple, you had the key to your problems right there and you crushed it to dust!!!"	t5_2srt7	True

I think it's tied into the fate of Kurt Flynn.  I think in a way Regina was telling the truth - he had left Storybrooke.  But he did so via Jefferson's hat.  And in order for that to happen, Regina let him remember his true self.

Now, how was he able to use the hat that time, but didn't know that Regina had magic to make it work again?  Simple - Regina infused it with magic before she brought him in and restored his memory.  So in his mind, the hat had worked one final time and then no longer worked.

Finally, *where* he was sent explains how Neil got to our world.  Kurt Flynn is in Neverland, and since travel by hat requires one person to leave and another to stay, Neil was brought back.  And to do so, he was knocked out before he was taken &amp; deposited outside of town when he woke up by Jefferson.  There was no ""town line curse"" then, so Jefferson would have been able to do so.  Or then again, he may not have knocked him out - just gotten him out of there before anyone knew Jefferson had brought him back.

So, what are your thoughts?

* Are there giants in other realms?

The long wait is over, season 2 of Once Upon A Time is finally (almost) upon us. 

I'm using this thread to move all of the season 1 discussions into a single post so they can make room for season 2 discussions.

I'll also take this time to restate the spoiler policy in a couple bullet points, as well as link you all to the official rules: [Spoiler Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/OnceUponATime/comments/rchdi/spoiler_policy_for_ronceuponatime/)

* Mark posts that contain spoilers by including [Spoilers] within the title of the post.
* Mark posts that contain speculation by including [Speculation] within the title of your post.
* Do not include spoilers of either kind within the title of your post.

I want to reiterate, if a thread will have spoilers in it, mark the title with [Spoiler]/flair/both to help others avoid spoilers. And you do not need to mark spoilers inside a thread already marked for spoilers. For example, in the S2E1 discussion thread, you wouldn't need to black out your text if you are discussing what happened in the episode. If you are mentioning the previews for the next episode though, you WOULD be required to mark that as spoilertext.

If you see a comment or post not following the rules, please report it ASAP so it can be removed.

The Season 2 Episode 1 discussion thread will be created around 5pm PST today.

Happy watching!

1336972079.0	tm1gy	My thoughts on the finale and where we're going (my post would be too long for a discussion comment) [SPOILERS]	sylphior	16	1	24	"to be honest, i would've preferred, not liked, if Henry wasn't resurrected. i just don't like the cliches of happy endings, which is obviously hard to contend with with this show specifically. but now that there is going to be a next season instead, it's good that he is brought back, i just wished they waited til the next season to do it then instead.

as for the episode itself, i thought it was very good. it was fast paced, we got through a lot and it still all felt connected and was easy enough to follow. all of the more intense scenes especially just got their point across and didn't toil around with petty dialogue. and i liked how we're given one story focused on a set of characters in Storybrooke while focused on others in FTL, instead of the usual of showcasing one character in both worlds.

and seeing the Huntsman again was fantastic! i was hoping we'd see him again sometime soon in FTL, since it would have been ridiculous (for now) to see him come back in Storybrooke. my mother almost forgot who we was because it's been so long! and Jefferson/Mad Hatter was great, he was a great supporting character to use to set things in motion behind the scenes.

as for everyone's motives and what their plans were, i have some thoughts and irks. the irk i have is with Jefferson's part. he freed Belle so that she can go to Rumpel/Mr. Gold and this would furiate him after finding out that Regina lied and made a fool of him, making him believe that Belle was dead. cause ultimately, Jefferson just wants revenge on Regina now, and he knows that Rumpel is the man to do it. but i'm sure he wasn't expecting Rumpel to turn the tables and bring magic to land, which as we all saw made Regina very happy. so in a way, this kind of backfired, but we'll have to see how this coming 'war' between Rumpel and Regina comes to in the second season, and i hope Jefferson gets a bigger role in it, even though now since his daughter should remember and they can live happily.

as for Rumpelstiltskin, i think he honestly did not know that Belle was still alive and can only be so happy to see her again. i see people say that this whole curse was part of his plan to find Bae and Belle again, but remember that he truthfully thought Belle was dead and he could not love again. he only wanted to find Bae. and in the last moments, him saying that magic is power questions his motive, but i still think he's just searching for Bae now cause why would they give us those character-driven episodes? these writers, of all people, know that they aired them with meaning.

i think he just believes if he has magic and power, he can find his son and now live happily with Belle and Bae with all his power. also, i know someone reminded us that he could never actually search for Bae without leaving Storybrooke, and brought the curse to travel to Storybrooke and break it himself(through manipulating Emma) to get out of it.

like i said, before, i think in the second season we're going to see a war between Rumpelstiltskin and Regina as the main focus. i cannot honestly think of what the rest of the characters are going to do, and the writers better think of something creative for Emma and Henry cause right now, in the scheme of things we're given, they're kind of useless now in a land full of magic."	t5_2srt7	True

I was interested in the heart box as we've seen these before.

I did a little [zoom-enhance](http://i.imgur.com/tEk1v.jpg) to see if the design might match [the crest on Regina's family crypt, ](http://i.imgur.com/sKZpS.jpg)but it does not match.

[Then there was the brass box for Snow's heart that the Queen had ready and waiting in her castle's creepy vault.](http://i.imgur.com/VQ5PM.jpg)

[The box that Regina retrieved the huntsman's heart from looked the same as Snow's.](http://i.imgur.com/RmxS2.jpg)

And then there was the heart from the thing she loved the most, Henry, her beloved father. When the Queen used it to create the curse she took it from a box with jewels on it.

[It looks to me like the same box that Regina keeps on her office desk.](http://i.imgur.com/TB34V.png) Maybe she keeps candy hearts in there now.

[Another intersting detail that I noticed is that Emma wears a necklace with a Swan design.](http://i.imgur.com/rcWj6.jpg)

And Ruby wears a ring with a wolf design. I wasn't absolutely sure at first so I took a few pics.

Is anyone else incredibly pissed about how Regina's life seems to keep ending up? And how it's pretty much always Rumple doing some s**t in the background? (Although I suppose that last bit is true for pretty much everyone.)

How I see it: She falls in love with a man who is killed before her by her own mother, she is forced to marry a man that I'm pretty sure *everyone* suspects of spousal rape at this point (I wonder if they will even address that at all), she is forced to raise a child she does not want (and who is, even if naively, also responsible for Daniel's death), then after some all out chaos between her and the other characters of FTL (that we haven't really seen) she is captured by Snow and Charming. They go to execute her and, funnily enough (/sarcasm), when she gives that lecture and Snow ""spares"" her Rumple is in the audience looking right at her. I can't help wonder if he *does* something to her at that time to make her... more angry than her base angry self. Then Rumple just gives Snow and Charming a way to ""test"" if Regina can ever have a normal life/recover/whatever. A test? FROM RUMPLE?! ARE YOU PEOPLE STUPID? Just knowing the source of the test I give it no credit. Maybe she would have stabbed Snow, maybe the knife was f'ing spelled. My point is that you can't know one way or the other because the source is too manipulative to make it a trustworthy test.

Then of course after they are in ""the real world"", she has Henry. Emma may be Henry's bio mother, but she didn't do all the dirty bits of parenting (sleeplness nights with babies for the first few years, all the lovely illnesses that come with childhood, school plays/functions, etc.). She also would not even recognize him if he walked by her on the street except he told her exactly who he was. Until then? Nada. Also, it seems to me that Emma parents very similarly to S1 Regina, which makes me very infuriated when it seems like the other characters think Emma is some kind of wonder-mom and Regina is a failure of a parent. The kid is a good kid. Good kids don't tend to come from broken homes (although it's not impossible, granted). Give the woman some god damned credit. Aside from the fact that Emma takes Henry AWAY from Regina, which I'm pretty sure CAN'T EVEN BE LEGAL, and she has to literally beg for time with HER OWN KID. On top of that, EVERYONE knows it and dangles it in front of her like a damned carrot - Cora, and hell even Snow. 

Then Regina is accused of killing Archie and Emma's ""supersense"" says she's innocent. Until, oh yes, Rumple has a test to see if she's guilty. Funnily enough, Rumple's test shows that she is guilty when she isn't. Huh. Imagine that, Rumple's test isn't infallible and points the finger at exactly who he wants blamed for something. Never would have seen that coming. And Emma is so great at casting magic that clearly she would be able to prevent any tampering from him or see the truth of the matter. But yea, let's ignore the never-wrong supersense instead. ACK.  And then Snow in this latest episode: the epitome of good right? ""You should help your mother because then you could be a family for Henry"" while Snow KILLS HER MOTHER. I don't really care how guilty Snow feels, that was some special level of manipulation right there. It's quite a bit worse than ""oops, wayward spell/arrow/whatever"".

Just. GAH. GAH. Maybe Regina's actions are overkill and maybe they aren't, but what gets me is that the ""good"" characters act JUST AS BAD. They just justify it better. And I can't help but think they were the same in FTL as ""the real world"". Though, of course, perhaps a bit more badass and black/white over there - but ignoring that they seem really similar. IMO, of course.

PS And now I even feel badly for Cora after this last episode. I mean good god man. That last scene was awful for my emotions :(

1363009908.0	1a2xn1	"Does ""true love"" have to be reciprocal? And could Regina ever give up loving and/or fighting for Henry? (Includes SPOILER)"	inalandnotsofaraway	17	2	12	"I forget, does true love have to be reciprocal? And does one have only one true love in his/her life (like soul mates, I guess)?

Emma woke Henry when he was in the hospital because of their true love, right? But in the mother-child way of true love so they could both be saved by romantic true loves?

Which makes me wonder, could Regina ever just get over Henry? We haven't yet learned how and why Rumple brought Henry to Regina but if she wanted a/any child to fill a void, do you see her possibly not needing Henry if she finds another love or, what?, becomes a loner?

Henry is an important thread because he ties the good and evil together in the story so far. And while I thought Regina could maybe fill a void left by Henry with the love of her mother (before Cora died), with Cora having her heart back, they could have been on their way to one new happy family with Regina, Cora and Henry (yea, right).

And we saw Henry be sympathetic towards Regina as his mother when she was trying to be good but what was their relationship like before Emma was in their lives? Before he was suspicious? Does he really love her, not just being sympathetic towards her?

Regina could let go of Daniel because he was just gone; zombie Daniel was a sad sight to her, wasn't enough and she couldn't handle [him like] that. Could she let go of Henry since he has this new family (well, nuclear, not so much the extended OUAT family tree), she is forever flip-flopping (though she has been denied trust...well, maybe she deserved it) between good and evil, and not only has Henry caused her emotional damage but she might as well assume he doesn't care that Cora died, so not caring that someone else his [adoptive] mother loved died.

Of course we saw Regina's mixed emotions when she realized Cora might not have Regina's and/or Henry's interest as a priority.

And we'll have to see how that plays out. Who can Regina hate anymore? Who can trust her anymore? Maybe this is just how it was when Emma arrived...everyone against Regina, Rumple just slinking around making deals.

* Mary Margaret states that she gave it to Henry a few months before Emma came to town. While time is twisted in Storybrooke, she couldn't have been Henry's teacher for more than a year since he ages normally and he's presumably had different teachers each year.
* August added/replaced/repaired(???) pages in the book before returning it to Henry.

Still to be answered (refresh my memory if I'm mistaken):

* Who created the book?
* How did Mary Margaret get the book?
* What exactly was in the pages that Henry and Emma tore out and burned, and will they play a significant part of the story in the future?
 
Random thoughts: 

* What was Henry and Regina's relationship like before Henry received the book?
* How do classic fairy tales, as told in the real world, fit into this story? Could our world's story tellers have traveled between worlds? (I sort of doubt that the show will explore this, even though the people of Storybrooke are aware of and acknowledge the existence of these fairy tales, however inaccurate they may be)"	t5_2srt7	True

1. Magic returns obviously. But it's unstable. No one can really tap into it to use it. Rumple spends the series trying to stabilise it.
2. Breaking the curse. Everyone remembered who they are after Emma kissed Henry but are still stuck in Storybrooke. I believe that Emma has to find True Love in order to break the curse. I'm guessing one of the male characters will begin to develop a romantic storyline with Emma to build this up be it either Pinocchio or The Mad Hatter Once Emma has true loves kiss with her true love, everyone will return to the enchanted forest. 
3. The family. The relationships between Emma, Henry, Charming and Snow will change drastically in the next series. Snow and Charming will have to cope with not just being parents, but grandparents as well while Emma will have the family she has never had.

As people who saw the episode know, Gold seems to be embracing his darker side now that Lacey approves of it, with the survival of the Sheriff of Nottingham a big question mark. This is, of course, in contrast to Rumplestiltskin softening up when Belle uses the same lines (e.g. ""you really are as dark as people say""). Basically, it seems to me that Rumple is giving up on recovering Belle, and instead seems satisfied with this Lacey, who is Belle's exact opposite.

The series has already told us that this is not how True Loves behave. When Snow goes bad back in FTL season 1, Charming fights every inch to show her what they had. When Snow's heart starts darkening, Charming is there to provide her with support. I'm worried that Rumple has given up on getting Neal's approval, and will focus on getting Lacey's approval instead, which of course is probably pretty bad for the citizens of Storybrooke and the recovery of Belle.

As I think about it more, I am doubting  that undoing actually means that Rumple dies, both because his character is very crucial to the plot, and because ""fatherless"" didn't mean death either. Right now, I think that Henry will somehow contribute to the undoing of the Dark One in the sense of Rumple losing his Dark One powers.

There are a lot of ways this could happen: Rumple goes after Henry, only to run into Regina/Emma. Rumple has a chance to take out Henry but hesitates, and the hesitation somehow causes him to lose his powers. Neal/Belle cause Rumple to lose his powers, and Rumple only got to interact with them because Henry brought Emma to Storybrooke.

Well for one thing, he must not have had any loved ones left who he could take a heart from to activate the curse. As far as we know, Mila, Bae, and Belle are his only loves in FTL (and he wasn't getting hearts from them). 

So with that in mind, did Rumple decide to train Regina in magic for the express purpose of her enacting the curse for him? Is that why he was so determined to turn her down the dark path of magic? Why he ensured she was adept at stealing hearts? Why he tricked her and crushed her last bit of hope so she'd become his apprentice?

Bonus question: where do all these prophecies of Rumple's come in?

EDIT: Perhaps an alternate [or simultaneous?] explanation is that Rumple created the curse, but didn't have the heart (ha!) to enact it himself because he was still too afraid of losing power in a land without magic. Though even then, he must have known Regina would eventually use it if she got it from him.

Otherwise it tends to be very hit or miss to me, but the concept and many of the subplots are charming enough. 

But there's been this [Unfortunate Implication](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications) just hanging over this show. Namely that the ultimate power and goodness of the world, True Love, only exists in the realm of white people. 

That might sound slightly hysterical, and I'm not even saying the writers have done it consciously, but it's started to get a bit ridiculous. The only interracial relationships seen have been toxic, villainous, coerced, false, and in the only positive case was completely one-sided on Mulan's part. 

Not to mention there have been 5 black characters, 3 of which were killed off immediately after they were introduced (Fairy Godmother, Lancelot, and Billy) and 2 of which have been villainous, Sidney having been freed from slavery by a kindly, virtuous white man whom he then murdered for his wife... nnnyeah. And Tamara is... well she's Tamara.

The show also seems to take issue with adoption and single parenthood sometimes, and gay people are just non-existent in this world of True Love conquering all, but I hardly expect television to be equipped to handle the latter. It may frustrate me so because as a writer I can see how these things can happen accidentally, but I can also see how they can be avoided with even a modicum of thought. It would also be nice to see a little more diversity, especially since they've already gone cross-cultural with the fairy tales.

Storms rage on a dark night. There's a house with a name written on the door and a candle flickering in the upstairs window. Van Helsing. Three knocks were heard and the door opened. An old Abraham Van Helsing - the famed Vampire Killer hands an envelope with a wax seal to a young boy. The young boy runs through the storm and boards a ship bound for the West Indies. 

**Modern Day Storybrooke:**

Neal takes Tamara to the Magic Well. He starts telling her stories from the Enchanted Forest and more about his father, Mr. Gold. In the woods, Henry is exploring August's abandoned trailers for clues about Pinnochio's final warning. Henry overhears his Dad talking to Tamara. He is shocked by his father revealing all of Storybrooke secrets to a stranger. 

Henry runs to warn Emma and breaks a stick. Neal looks up and sees Henry running off, he chases after him. Tamara looks at the well and begins to press her hands all around it.

**Fairytale Land (Today)**

Mulan and Aurora begin realizing their quest to find Philip will require far more magic than either of them have. They begin walking toward the deep and dark parts of the Enchanted Forest, searching for a fountain.

**Storybrooke (Today)**

Owen is again confronted by Regina, this time in public. Granny and Ruby overhear their conversation. Owen says he just wants his father back, or he will show videos to the whole world. He says that even if they hurt him, he had hours of video already with a friend. Regina tells him to give it up, his Dad left long ago. 

**1732 - Holland**

Abraham Van Helsing looks up at his mantle. Several things can be seen, a vile of a glowing potion, a collection of fangs, sketches of werewolves and vampires. He throws his fist up on the mantle and in a last agonizing breath knocks it all to the ground. He pours his lamp oil over it, and torches his place. 
A ship can be seen through the window with sails flying high, lit only by the lightning in the night sky, sailing away.
The name of the ship is etched on the side, The Nautilus. A young boy grasping the wax sealed envelope, looks over the starboard bow, leaving Amsterdam. 

**Storybrooke (Today)**

Tamara is walking back into town when she notices a ship sailing into shore. She receives a text from, Him. It says, “We gt to gt 2 the library, I’ve got enuf.”
Owen and Regina go their separate ways. He tells her he will leave, if he can just say goodbye to his friend, Lacey.  Regina obliges him and tells him he can find her at the library. 
Henry is racing toward Emma and sees Hook’s ship sailing in. He begins running to the fields of the magic beans veering far away from the town and from seeing his mom. Anton is there but taking a nap. The dwarves had gone with the Blue Fairy back to the mines, convinced that fairy dust can help if the magic beans take them to the wrong land. Henry climbs a beanstalk and grabs a bean. He begins running toward the magic well, when he is stopped by Dr. Hopper. 
Dr. Hopper asks Henry what he is up to. Henry nervously tells Dr. Hopper that he is just taking a bean to Charming and Snow to show them how well they are grown. Dr. Hopper is suspicious but believes Henry. As Henry runs away, Mr. Gold and Dr. Hopper begin to talk about what Henry has just done. Mr. Gold tells Dr. Hopper that they have to run to Charming and Snow, and grab Regina as well if they can find her. 

**Fairytale Land (Today)**

Mulan looks at Aurora. This is it. Mulan draws her sword and begins slicing through deep brush and thicket. Aurora grabs a bow and points it into the trees. Darkness grows thicker, and noises grow ever more menacing. 
“Quick!” Mulan yells and points into the sky. Aurora fires an arrow. A creature tumbles down. They run up to the kill. What’s this? A monkey with wings, does not exist in the Enchanted Forest but this is what they’ve killed. 

**Storybrooke (Today)**

Henry approaches the well, and calmly looks around. There is no one. He throws the bean down the well. A poof of green smoke flies into the sky. Henry climbs onto the well. He knows this is the only way. He screams for his parents to love each other and dives into the well. 
Dr. Hopper and Dr. Gold have managed to get Regina, Snow, Charming, Emma and Neal together. They explain what Henry had said. Neal is there as well, and sighs. He looks up and says “I think I know where he has gone.”
Captain Hook sails into port. Tamara and Owen are staring at the ship, when a fat rat climbs out onto the dock. Captain Hook climbs onto the dock; the rat goes right up the plank and onto the ship. Tamara looks at Hook with a smile, and says, “I see you like to arrive in style.” Hook says, “Bloody Rats, anyway we have some work to do. And Owen it’s nice to finally meet you, your father sends his best.” Owen looks to Tamara with a jealous look, and then demands  “Where is he!”  Hook replies, “In time.”

**Fairytale Land (Today)**

Mulan and Aurora hear something in the woods, a cracked stick and ruffling bushes. A cloaked man appears and removes his hood. “I see you’ve got one of these things, they’ve been coming out of a fountain not far from here.” Mulan is quick to draw a sword. “I am Robin Hood and am here to assist you.” 

**1732 - Nautilus – Near the Azores**

The young boy, letter in hand, heads to speak with the Captain. “Captain Nemo, where are we headed?” the lad asked. “To a new world, far removed from those who hate your family. There are new monsters there, ones that do not know of you Van Helsings.” 

*Several weeks later*

“Land in sight!” yelled a sailor from the crow’s nest. The boy looked up through his telescope. Tropical islands lined the horizon. “Watch out for Pirates lads” –shouted Captain Nemo. 

**Storybrooke (Today)**

Tamara, Hook, and Owen begin talking on the dock. They say only a few words, when Tamara said she had to get back to Neal. Owen told Hook about being stuck in Storybrooke in 1983. Hook tells Owen to find the rat aboard his ship, and to keep himself hidden. Hook says that he will tell everybody that he had left to go back to Pennsylvania. Hook then tells Owen to be a stowaway for he felt a return to his land was imminent.  

**1983 – St. Martin, Caribbean**

There is a small shack on the beach with Voo Doo symbols, signs, and trinkets all around it. An elderly lady answers a knock at her door.  She opens the door with a smile, and then drops the glass in her hand to the floor. A tall, menacing, man is staring at her. She shouts – “Run Tam, Hide! They’ve found us!”
The man stares at the elderly woman as she begins to say a frantic mix of Voo Doo prayers. The man is wearing a small broach on his finely tailored suit. He begins to speak in a thick Eastern European English. “I do not know how this has happened, it is like one day I was asleep and the next I was awake. I have never forgotten what your family did. I must have vengeance. So that is why you must die.”
The woman looks at the door and in Dutch says, “He can’t understand Dutch so listen to me. I am going somewhere else. Our family has a long history in this world. Look for a very old letter in the cupboard after he leaves. “

**Storybrooke (Today)**

Neal looks at everyone and says. “I know where he has gone. I ran there too, mad at my father.” Emma and Regina look at him with conviction, Emma’s hand on her holster and Regina’s on her wand. Neal says – “He has gone to become lost. He will join them, become them, and hide with them.” Dr. Gold looks at everyone and says, “Neverland.” 
At that moment, Hook walks in through the door with Tamara. Neal looks up with a fierce smirk on his face. Dr. Gold looks at Hook and grabs his staff up to his chest. Hook says that he wants no trouble, only to go back home. Charming agrees that this would be best for everyone. They all agree they will have to take Hook’s ship to find Henry. 

**1983 – St. Martin**

The young girl sees her grandmother disappear before her eyes, along with the man. She races to the cupboard. An old rusty looking letter with a red wax seal dated 1732, but never opened was in the bottom shelf. 
The girl quickly opens it, it reads in Dutch with several words scribbled out:
&gt;“To my descendent,
&gt;
&gt;	You are a Van Helsing. We are a family that has saved the world many times throughout history. 	
&gt;If you have been told to open this letter, it is your time again. Make sure that no one knows unless they already know, destroy all those who get in your way. 
&gt;	Careful you do not wake him again………………………………………………………….Full moon…….
&gt;	…………………………………………………………………………………….Doctor Jec…………
&gt;	….Franken……………………………………….
&gt;	………………………………..Tr…..ia………………………………….Hapsburg…………………..

&gt;	Abraham V. Helsing”


**Storybrooke (Today)**


Tamara looks at Neal with shock, but a magic sparkle in her eye. She asks to be taken to the library to check out a book. 

On the way, Dr. Whale is walking on the other side of the street. He sees her. He immediately changes course and heads into the hospital. Dr. Whale opens a door down a dark corridor and races to a room. Morgue, is written above the door. Dr. Whale slams the door open and races to the last unit. The name above the now empty unit reads Bram S.

Dr. Whale looks around frantically and then says under his breath, “Van Helsing.”

He would have been a little less dumbfounded when it came to the mystical elements August presented him. Why would he try to trick August into believing he was normal? If that was the case, wouldn't he have gone back for Emma?

2. Picture this: Henry is growing up. No one else is. No one else notices this except Henry. Henry asks questions. Regina has two options. She can tell him the truth,  at least her side of things, and help him pioneer his life with her help in these circumstances. He's willing to believe a book, why not his mother? What she does instead is LIE LIE and LIE. She denies clear and present evidence that he is in the right. She furthermore insists that he may not be mentally stable and pressures his therapist into corroborating this idea. This is a billion levels of plain and simple emotional abuse. Emma could have called social services and Regina would need to lawyer up, she would lose rights to Henry right then and there despite being financially supportive (and being financially supportive isn't love. It's responsibility, a bottom line for a parental guardian. Don't give her an award for basic parenting). Regina is a horrible mother, and just because you love someone doesn't mean you're what's best for them.

Trying to change is a good step. Reacting to neglect, by people she has tormented for almost three decades, with physical violence and threats is not okay. She's setting a shitty example for Henry. Regina is not a good mother."	t5_2srt7	True

1337132978.0	tp8w5	[Speculation] Maleficent, Big Bads + Different Lands/Towns/Fairytales	DaymanX	15	4	3	"Now that magic has returned and Storybrooke has their memories back, I've been wondering how the show can sustain its first season formula without doing some sort of big reset and wiping everybody's minds.

The curse supposedly affected all the lands, and while we've met maybe 20 characters so far, the show has yet to touch upon so many fairytales that there needs to be an effective and interesting way to introduce them into mix.

I personally don't see it being very interesting if every new present day character we meet is already aware of who they were in Fairytale Times.

Similar to Snow White and the Evil Queen, I also see a lot of potential in conflicted characters from the other fairytales that ABC/Disney is drawing from.

With that in mind, here are my thoughts on where the show might be headed:

Maleficent will be back (in human form) as an additional ""Big Bad."" She will probably want revenge on Regina, and might be resurrected by Rumplestiltskin. This would also bring Sleeping Beauty and her Prince into the mix.

We'll probably also learn about the existance of other towns with Fairytale characters midway through Season 2. Because a magical Storybrooke, where everyone remembers, probably won't be interesting for too long--though I do look forward a fun montage of the nuns doing day to day tasks using pixie dust.

Each of these new towns will be based on a different kingdom from Fairytale Times with its own mix of dual characters that don't remember anything. This will be used to introduce further big bads and heroes in future seasons.

Emma and August will have to travel to these other towns and ""awaken"" the characters in an effort to recruit them to fight some sort of ""even bigger bad"" -- probably a coalition of big bads that Regina and Mr. Gold will be trying to work with.

One compatible collection of characters would be a seaside area, or even Atlantic City-type community where Ursula/Ariel and Peter Pan/Captain Hook co-exist in modern day. They could even do the Oz characters, using an urban area as a modern day Emerald City.

I think that there could also be a ""Wonderland, Massachusettes,"" where the Red Queen, etc. lives--though maybe not since the Mad Hatter was in Storybrooke, but I'm sure they could come up with some reason why he could travel.

This way the show can keep its format and formula, while expanding the area outside of Storybrooke and giving us more present day drama and adventure, contrasted against the Fairytale flashbacks.

The more I think about it, the more interesting I think this could be for how the show expands its universe while maintaining its basic premise.

I think this is potentially one of the deepest issues in the series, but I haven't seen too many serious discussions about it)

Do you think the Regina/Huntsman(Graham) relationship is trivialized as a portrayal of stereotypical male fantasies of domination and seduction (or even an outright joke a la ""Death by snu-snu""). Do you think the writers (or the upcoming comic) will ever try to address this as a celar issue of abuse, or try to rationalize it somehow (if they ever touch upon it at all)?

Is the Regina/Leopold relationship trivialized by the fact that we are disposed to dislike Regina after being introduced to her later in life as the Evil Queen? Or does her past actually strike a chord with some viewers because as a relatively realistic situation (as opposed to a magical caricature in the Huntsman's case)? 

Or perhaps do you think these stories have already been treated in a respectful manner? How do you think social notions of gender and sexual dynamics affect how these two relationships are perceived (individually and in relation to each other)?

1372617199.0	1hdkeh	The Elephant Pregnancy: A timeline conundrum.	Jacinator	15	5	3	"I like the premise of this show and I desperately want it to ""work"" but these little things drive me insane and turn me off. Hopefully one of you can offer a workable solution to this and I've just been missing it. 

Here's the timeline I've got :

1) Cinderella wants to go to the ball. Fairy Godmother shows up, Rumple disposes of her, Cinderella signs the contract and is on her way!
2) Presumably the ball goes well, she gets married , they do the baby dance and bam! deal-fulfillment is in progress. 

3) She meets with Rumple because ""twins"" and helps entrap him.

4) Curse yada yada, too young for a baby, prince is gone, still pregnant. 


Number 2 is about where my issues start. We see Snow at Cinderella's wedding, I don't think she's married, and Rumple hasnt been captured so we know she isnt pregnant. 

We see her again at number 3 where Cinderella is CLEARLY pregnant. Let's do some generous math here: Cinderella could be huge at 6 months and Snow could be tiny at 4 months. We can even go ahead and say that Emma was born early (I think she was?) and give her a whole month for that. Cinderella STILL would have had her baby at least a month before Emma. And I think this math is completely unreasonable as I'm pretty sure Snow/Charming didnt get married until after Rumple was caged. 

The only way I see this working would be if Snow was pregnant at Cinderella's wedding but that wouldnt explain why Cinderella was huge at the Rumple Meeting and Snow wasnt showing at all. Plus it goes against Snows character to be running around kicking ass while knocked up. She would have protected her baby and waited to get pregnant. 

The other option is that Cinderella was pregnant for over a year and closer to two (not counting the whole time she was cursed).

Any suggestions?


Oh! and on a slightly related note, we know Cinderella is 19 but I thought she was closer in age to Snow. Any idea how old Snow and Charming are?

Lacey is a pretty kickass girl, although I understand why you guys miss belle. (I personally think that towards the end of this season, belle/lacey's personality will find a medium where she is the kind hearted belle, while still likes to party)


Anyway, it really REALLY got to me that Lacey was so into Rumple beating the hell out of Nottingham, (whilst I think Belle was also pretty grateful?)

And well I guess what I'm trying to figure out if it is a bit of Belle's personality that is seeping through to lacey to be digging Rumple, or is it totally opposite? (I'm sorry if I'm not wording this right)


I know I personally like the idea of a guy being protective of me, but I'm not sure how normal it is to be all ""OOOh You *are* as bad as they say, yummy"" about it. (I seriously think if the show wasn't rated tv14 she would have totally s'd his D right there) Oh you naughty boy...

Based on the promo we got for ""Selfless, Brave and True"" (and the title itself is important, but I'll get back to that), I'm pretty sure (along with the help of one of my friends) that Tamara is Tiger Lily.

According to the [Disney wiki on Tiger Lily](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Tiger_Lily), ""Tiger Lily is the daughter of the Native Chief and a loyal friend of Peter Pan. Her friendship with Peter Pan leads Captain Hook to believe that Tiger Lily knows where Peter Pan's hideout is located.""  The wiki also specifically describes her as ""loyal"" and ""brave,"" which is where next week's episode's title comes into play.

It has been confirmed by OUAT producer Jane Espensen that Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) will return in 2x18, which is, of course, next week.  Hook, as we all know, was left in some sort of storage closet by Emma, Snow, Charming, and Rumpel before they took the Jolly Roger back to Storybrooke.  Further, [according to IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230/episodes?season=2&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_2), the last two episodes of this season are [Spoiler]""Second Star to the Right,"" followed by ""And Straight On Til Morning,"" both of which clearly refer to Peter Pan, Neverland, and the like.[/spoiler]  Again, as we all know, Hook is after Rumpelstiltskin, the ""Crocodile,"" for stealing Mila and cutting off his hand.  If Tamara is Tiger Lily, it would make sense that Neal/Bae was Peter Pan, considering Tiger Lily's knowledge of Peter Pan's whereabouts and her desire to keep that information from Hook.  It would only fuel Hook's anger if he were to find out that the Crocodile's son was Peter Pan, someone we can probably assume he hates for a reason yet to be disclosed.  In tonight's episode, ""Welcome to Storybrooke,"" [Spoiler]we found out that Emma and Neal/Bae had made plans for Henry to return with Neal/Bae to New York, which, of course, is where Tamara and Hook presently are.(/spoiler)  If Hook was to discover Neal/Bae's ties to his Crocodile through someone close to Neal - Tamara, for example - he would do everything in his power to get his hands on her because if he finds Neal, Neal would be able to lead Hook to his Crocodile.

Also, a sidenote, because my mother tried to punch a hole in this theory.  She argued that if Tamara *was* Tiger Lily, she would have no recollection of magic, seeing as she wasn't transported to Storybrooke with the rest of the Fairytale crew.  However, I have a potential work-around for this. [Spec]Regina's curse transported *people* to Storybrooke and wiped their memories.  Neal/Bae ended up in New York [Spoiler]because of the portal Rumpel created.(/spoiler) However, this *doesn't* explain how the Jolly Roger got to Storybrooke, as we all know it did.  If Hook managed to get his hands on some fairy/Neverland magic to transport himself and his ship, Tamara, being Tiger Lily, would have come from Neverland and had access to the same thing.(/speculation)

Therefore, [Spec]Tamara = Tiger Lily, making Neal/Bae = Peter Pan.(/speculation)"	t5_2srt7	True

They both go up to a beanstalk with a blonde companion- Hercules/Emma.  Hercules/Emma even implies that they do not trust Auto/Hook.  At one point, Autolycus uses his grappling hook to try to get away, and it fails and he says ""My hook!""
  
Both Hook and Auto get captured inside a cage.  Herc/Emma eventually try to help a giant- which the giants from both shows look rather similar- childish and wearing ponytails.

This subreddit is meant to be a safe place to talk about the TV series regardless of how many episodes you've seen. **Warnings are required before all spoilers.** Please follow the guidelines below to insure everyone has a good time here and enjoys the TV show to the fullest.

_____
**What is a Spoiler?**

Opinions differ on what exactly is a real spoiler, but for the purposes of clarity, the following descriptions use ""not a spoiler"" to mean ""not a spoiler moderated in /r/OnceUponATime."" This is not meant to define what a spoiler is to you, only to describe what types of spoilers are moderated here.

Spoiler moderation for this subreddit is limited to ""events from the show."" That basically means anything that ""happens"" in the series is spoiler information. Things that simply ""exist"" in some form at the beginning of series are not spoilers, but changes to something during the course of the series are spoilers. Very early story events that are ""setup"" for the rest of the series (like Emma travels to Storybrook) are considered established ""setting"" information that is not a spoiler. Some examples:

**Not Spoiler | Spoiler**

* Saying a character is a hero/villain/badass/jerk | Describing a character's heroic/evil/awesome/lame deeds

* Saying a character is handsome | Saying a character is now ugly due to an injury during the series

* ""Let's talk about Emma in episode 3"" | [""Let's talk about Emma's death in episode 3""](/spoiler)

* ""I wish Emma would adopt Henry"" | [""Emma adopted Henry!""](/spoiler)

Spoilers need warning. That means don't put spoilers in your post's title. If you're linking to an image, check the thumbnail to be sure it's not a spoiler. If you're writing a tag cover, check it to be sure it's done right and actually works. If you're posting from a browser that doesn't allow tag links, don't post any spoilers. 

The spoiler warning in a post title has scope. For example, if a title says ""[Spoilers Ep 13]"" then the warning covers everything up to and including episode 13, and those events do not need cover tags, but spoiler events from later episodes do need warning tags. A title with only ""spoilers"" may contain information from any episode, including future episodes. Be aware of the warning scope with each post. 

Jokes that pretend to be a spoiler may also require tags if they are explicit enough to be taken seriously by some people. Revealing the joke may result in a reverse-spoiler, and even without confirmation such posts tend to cause a lot of drama. So if you're posting a joke like that just use a spoiler tag to cover the joke to prevent confusion.

____ 


**What is Speculation?**

Speculation spoilers are detailed theories regarding information that has not yet been revealed in the broadcast episodes. Examples of speculation that always needs a speculation warning/tag includes:

* The true secret heritage of any character, including talk of different what-if parents for a character and any formulas: A+B=C.

* The surprise return of any character thought to be dead for whatever reason.

* The meaning of any prophecies that have not yet been revealed.

Minor speculation may be included under a regular spoiler tag while talking about other event details, but major speculation like the above is considered ""more spoiler"" than regular events and must be under separate speculation tags.

When posting speculation-specific threads, using ""spoilers"" is not enough. By default that means only published/produced information. Speculation threads need ""speculation"" explicitly stated in the title or posts inside the thread will need tag covers.

**What to do with a Spoiler**

If you encounter a live spoiler without proper warning, report it immediately. Downvoting is good but isn't enough. There's a link labeled ""report"" under every post, and you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOnceUponATime). If you post a reply to the spoiler don't add an uncovered copy of the spoiler in your comment; it just makes the problem worse. Also don't just reply with ""SPOILERS!"" You may be wrong, or be making a bigger deal out of a mild spoiler. You can post your ""SPOILERS!"" reply using a cover tag to draw less attention to the post, and/or simply report it to the mods for review.

When you see a tempting spoiler warning beyond your exposure level, have some self-control. You don't have to look at that spoiler. You know you'll be mad if you do.

When replying to a warned spoiler, be conscious of the need to tag your own comment appropriately. If a post's title has a warning in it, it's ok to reply without a tag if the title warning also covers your content.

A lot has been revealed this last episode. We can now connect some dots that we couldn't before. I will outline a few of them here. Keep in mind this contains massive amounts of speculation.

As of the episode “The Queen Is Dead” we now know that:

* Neal is Baelfire (""Manhattan"")
* Neal knows who Hook is
* Neal went to at least one other land before ours (most likely Neverland being one)
* Neal can sail a pirate ship

Building from these facts we can try and make some guess about some other mysteries of the show. Particularly surrounding Neal and August.

Firstly we must consider both of these character's lives. Both Neal and August had fathers who loved them tremendously but sacrificed being with them: Rumple for power and Gepetto to help protect Emma and eventually help her break the curse. Both were left to fend for themselves as young boys in a strange land. These events could easily put both of them on a path to become Lost Boys in Neverland.

Baelfire noted that our world was not his first stop so we know he went to another land before ours. Taking into account what he revealed in regards to knowing who Hook was and that he could sail a pirate ship it's also safe to assume he was in with Peter Pan in some fashion, most likely a Lost Boy. After Baelfire left Neverland, however that happened, the same Lost Boys remained. Memories of Baelfire intact. 

Early in August's life in our world he was an orphan on his own who was charged with looking after an infant Emma whom he abandoned to leave with a group of other orphans. Where they went has not been revealed but it's no stretch to think that maybe they made their way to Neverland (or at least August did somehow). It's possible that upon arriving in Neverland he joined with the Lost Boys and told them his story. They noted how it was similar to another Lost Boy's story, Neal, and mention so to August. Naturally he inquires and learns about who Baelfire is. This would explain how August knew who Neal was.

However, Neal did not recognize August which suggests they were not in Neverland at the same time nor have they met face to face before. This brings up another question though: how did August know what Neal looked like? How did he know who to look for? Neal/Baelfire doesn't really have any distinguishing feature(s) to be identified by and I doubt the Lost Boys had a polaroid of Baelfire. Did someone show him? Could there be another lost boy out there who came back with August? If not, who pointed August to Neal in the first place?

Like most things in OUAT we get some answers which only bring up more questions. Lots of things are still up in the air. To me this brings two storylines together in a very cool way and is by no means a stretch of the imagination. We'll just have to wait for the long overdue August episode to see what they reveal.

* Belle and Rumple, lots and lots of rumbelle. And I kind of want them in bed together... I do.. really bad to the point of writing raunchy fan fiction about it. 


* Henry is so fracking annoying. I think it is the actors fault not the scripts. I want to see this change, I want to like Henry. AND Aurora dear heaven I know the woman can act better than that. She was killer in the Tutors.

If a character dies in one place do they die in both?  or are there 2 versions of each person in existence?  Were the people transported out of FTL or were copies of them made and one exists in FTL (presumably in suspended animation for the time being) and one exists in Storybrook?
Any thoughts/theories?

EDIT:  I am aware that all the events we see of FTL are flashbacks and that during the time that the characters are in Storybrook there is essentially *no FTL*.  The question I am posing is whether or not the events that take place in Storybrook (namely deaths) will have any effect on their lives in FTL?  How much will they remember?  How happy will the ""ending"" truly be?  If there's not FTL explanation for an otherwise healthy person (like the huntsman) to die, how would that death be explained, or will they die at all?

Ok, so I've noticed that during the flash of the title of ""Once Upon a Time"" every episode (except the first) there has been a different character/object underneath the title.  It seems (perhaps loosely) that the character/object deems what the show is going to be about.

Ep2: A steed/unicorn: This episode is about the Queen and her horse's heart, but also about Malificent and her ""pet"", which looked something like a unicorn..sort of.. a horse with a horn anyway. 

Ep3: A man on a horse (looks like Prince Charming): This episode is about how Snow and James met. He chases her through the forest etc.

Ep4: A fairy (godmother?): This episode is about Cinderella.

Ep5: A spindle: This episode is about Jiminy Cricket, but it shows Rumpelstiltskin using the spindle.
-- which brings me to my next ponder --

A lot of people have been saying that the coffin at the bottom of the mine is the one from Snow White's tale, but I first thought that it could have been Sleeping Beauty (because of the whole spindle thing). I have no idea how that could be, but that was my first thought. The curse has done strange things..

So just as a little background, each OUAT character's Storybrooke name is something based off of their life back in FTL. For example, Archie Hopper was obviously a play off of him being a cricket, and Mr. Gold was based off of him turning straw to gold.

So, my question is simple: why is Dr. Whale, whom we have learned is Dr. Frankenstein in FTL, called Dr. Whale? It has nothing to do with Frankenstein. Could it possibly have something to do with another story, like how Rumpel is a different character in more than one story?

[Speculation]	inalandnotsofaraway	14	7	25	"I've read some speculation that Neal Cassady could be Aladdin. Then people say that a Caucasian actor wouldn't be cast as Aladdin. Then I go, Huh?

As a child I assumed the Aladdin in Disney's ""Aladdin"" was Indian for some reason. The Aladdin story comes from a Middle Eastern set of tales. However, as I understand it, the character of Aladdin was Chinese.

Ethnically Chinese/Far Eastern or just lived there? I am not sure, I need to read more.

As for the word Caucasian being used on in other posts concerning Aladdin and actor Michael Raymond-James as Neal Cassady, here's why I go, Huh?: I assume that by Caucasian you mean a white person--what is usually considered a white person in the US--shouldn't play Aladdin because he is Middle Eastern based on our experience with the Disney version of the story, I guess. Or because it is a Middle Eastern folk tale. But I always think of many Middle Easterners being Caucasian. And if the writers want to switch it up and really hit the source material, Aladdin would be Chinese.

If that were the case, could there be a connection between Mulan and Aladdin...and even Genie/Glass? I'd have to look into the time/era differences in the stories of Aladdin and Mulan but not sure that matters that much in OUaT.

I say source material but, again, I need to do more research on this including, maybe, what was considered ""China"" in the Arabian Nights tales. I first went to the Wikipedia page on the Aladdin story because I had to update myself from my thoughts as a young child that Aladdin was Indian.

And I consider Indian people Caucasian, too. Maybe ""White"" would be a better descriptor?

Not that all this race crap should matter as much as it has on this planet...blah

Now you may be saying to yourself ... but the talisman worked when she held it the second time! I'm aware of that, but I think the talisman only worked because Charming was holding it and touching her. I think the talisman needs a ""link"" for it to be able to predict the sex of an unborn baby. Until the moment when Charming and Snow were married and then held hands they were still separate people ... Snow ... and Charming, but once they were married it provided the ""link the talisman needed to accurately predict Emma's future.

I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if at some point Snow becomes pregnant again and loses the baby this time(because she is still cursed) which would create a much darker/less sympathetic character.

They're going to be taking it slow, wracked by guilt and other emotions from what they did when they were in their alter egos. I do see bonding with Emma, though. They set up the story of how they took the kingdoms back in FTW, and I think it will parallel how they take control back from Regina, who's now in her mansion (castle) with magic to back her up.

**Storybrooke residents:**

Yeah, they all got their memories back. But we don't know who considers themselves better off than they were in FTW, and some of them may in fact fight to protect their Storybrooke lives, complicating things for Team Snow.

**Rumplestiltskin:**

I don't think he's going to be anywhere around Storybrooke for a time. He created the curse to come to Earth and find Baelfire, only to be physically trapped in a town with no way to locate his son among six billion human beings. I think he resorted to magic to track him down, and he and Belle will have a detached arc. It will likely culminate in finding an eldery Baelfire playing with his grandkids.

**Henry's father:**

Regina needs allies, and chances are she's going to track him down. He'll probably be a ruthless bastard pissed off at Emma, and Regina will convince him to use Henry as a weapon against her, just as Emma used the boy against Regina to devastating effect.

Emma and Mary discuss the fact that Henry believes Mary is Snow White and John Doe is Prince Charming. Dr. Hopper thinks it's funny that Henry thinks that he is Jiminy Cricket. 

So my question is, if FTL was ""real"" and the curse brought all of its inhabitants into the Real World, how are the traditional fairy tales known by everyone. I'm having a hard time trying to wrap my mind around this. 

Obviously Henry has the book, but it's a special book an the story it tells is not the traditional tale of Snow White, et al. It seems like Emma, Mary, and the rest are all familiar the HC Andersen, the Brothers Grimm, and maybe even Disney versions of the stories. (Which would explain Pongo!)

So I'm including name meanings for the fairy tale characters in the ""real world"" and wonder what others think.

Mary Margaret - Mary usually means ""bitter,"" but can sometimes be associated with the Latin word for ""sea"". Margaret means ""pearl,"" making Snow White ""bitter pearl"" or ""sea pearl"".

David - ""Beloved"" (Prince Charming)

Emma - ""whole"" or ""universal""

Henry - ""home ruler""

Regina - ""queen""

Archie (Archibald) - ""precious"" or ""true""

Ruby - ""red"" (obviously)

Ashley - ""ash tree"" This one is particularly interesting because ash trees are often associated with the Cinderella tale for various reasons.

[I guess she'll never be able to find true love again because her true love (Daniel) is dead, but maybe it will give her an element of compassion instead of being so evil and therefore cure her. The theory could be supported by when Snow drank the potion to forget James she forgot how to love all together, and because she didn't know how to love she was pretty much just a bitch all the time, until she *remembered* how to love again so the rest of her personality turns back to normal.

In the pilot episode (101) when Emma is leaving town and crashes into the Storybrooke sign the book falls open to a page with Alice and the caterpillar, and later when Emma checks into Granny's B&amp;B we see that Granny has some Alice figures on her check-in desk in the lobby. I also learned in this [blog post](http://ouat.roneyzone.com/tag/alice-in-wonderland/) that there was a waitress at Granny's restaurant that looked like Alice (ep.111), the girl's night out in Skin Deep (112) the bar was called the White Rabbit, and there was a guy eating a carrot who answered the door in Dreamy (114).

[Granny's desk with Alice figures, book page in car](http://i.imgur.com/39OqF.jpg)

Once we get introduced to Jefferson, and he drugs Emma with some tea, we get a look around his house and spy some interesting decor including some Alice references: tea cup, maze-y throw cushions and painting on the mantle, eggs on mantle reminiscent of Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc.

[Alice-y items in Jefferson's home](http://i.imgur.com/ppzgm.jpg)

Emma puts it together and realizes he thinks he's the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland. I'm pretty sure Jefferson had already thought of that as he has some Alice illustrations by [John Tenniel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tenniel) on his walls.

[hallway pictures, Tenniel pics reference](http://i.imgur.com/I1Ltq.jpg)

The set up for Jefferson's downfall is heartbreaking and one of many parts that made this a great story.

He can not afford the rabbit toy.
So he makes one.
Grace loves it.
Tea party with stones for scones and buttons for cakes.
He feels guilty and determines to take the job.
He says goodbye and promises to return.

composite 4 - storyboard

Later when we see Grace as Paige with her Storybrooke family we can understand his madness. It was also heartbreaking to see Emma fake believing so she could thunk him with the telescope.

[look through telescope at family Grace is staying with](http://i.imgur.com/vEgdn.jpg)

Once in Wonderland we see what the production team can do with virtual characters and environments. Some said Wonderland looked fake and placticy but I thought it was amazing. How real does a place like Wonderland need to look?

[wonderland maze](http://i.imgur.com/Wjf1e.jpg)

We get a look at the Queen of Hearts vault where Regina finds the heart she was looking for.

[the heart vault](http://i.imgur.com/exPuD.jpg)

Jefferson is captured and brought before the Queen of Hearts. When he tries to make a deal to get back to his daughter the Queen says, ""Off with his head!"". He is given the task to get the hat to work, which explains why he has kidnapped Emma -- for her special magic.

[queen's court, off with his head](http://i.imgur.com/Cm4DI.jpg)

Emma and Mary Margaret fight to escape and we see that Jefferson has a scar on his neck. He falls from a fatal height but on the ground there is nothing but hat.

In the end we see Jefferson madly trying to make hats so he can get home. There is some [history to the phrase ""mad as a hatter.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_hatter)

&gt;  *inspired by the phrase ""as mad as a hatter"", there is some uncertainty as to the origins of this phrase. Mercury was used in the process of curing felt used in some hats, making it impossible for hatters to avoid inhaling the mercury fumes given off during the hat making process; hatters and mill workers thus often suffered mercury poisoning*

I can imagine a hatter going mad from the mercury fumes, working with a scissors all day long, becoming fascinated with the twin blades, and wondering if a person were very small, what kind of harm one might do. It was a dark episode and a great story. I loved it.

Discussion: possible spoilers.	jbmonster	9	2	14	"Now, after seeing Cora die, and her connection to Ava, Snows mother, I had realization. Cora has always been the millers daughter from the Grimm fairytale. Also with Regina hating Snow even more so now, that sets her/their ending. Remember, while you WANT Regina to change, and you WANT her to have her happy ending, she can't. Because her story is already written. Here's a refresher.

In season one, Henry made it his goal to convince Emma she was the chosen one, and Emma pacified this view of Henrys because she didn't believe, I think in part due to his shitty acting. However, things started adding up one day on a park bench when she was asking about the Book. Remember what he told her? All the stories were already finished, EXCEPT Pinnochios. His wasnt finished. Does anyone remember where Henry verified the story in the book AS IT WAS HAPPENING? 

Then, two weeks ago we find out the boy would be Golds undoing. And then tonight we find out the Millers Daughter was indeed Cora. Her demise was never revealed in the original story Here -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpelstiltskin 

But she DOES have a kid. Regina MUST turn evil. Because without her being evil, Snow and Charming will never have their happy ending. Follow their original story here -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White

1361776277.0	196j8p	Curse's timeline is messed up, isn't it?	Sparkism	6	0	11	"Rumple did not create the True Love potion until Heart of Darkness where he traded for Charming's cloak. That means he could not have created the dark curse until at least Snow lost her memories and she and Charming was already separated.

But that presents a problem. Somewhere between Snow attempting to kill Regina and Charming stopping her, and before Snow eating the apple, Regina and Gold did a deal for the dark curse AND she traded it for a sleeping curse with Maleficient. She then used Hanzel and Gretel to get the apple from the blind witch (True North) because she needed to know what the curse is or how to obtain it before using H&amp;G to get it.

This all happens between above and Snow trying to rescue Charming from Castle (Fairy bombardment!), because we know Regina already has the trap ready. She meets Snow at the basement via a mirror to tell her to meet where they first met.

That means, in the span of Charming making a deal with Rumple, finds snow, takes an arrow, and gets dragged to a dungeon. Rumple impressively managed to creates the dark curse, gets it to Regina, and Regina more impressively trading something to Rumple, trades that curse to Maleficient, and then using H&amp;G to get apple, AND making a trade with George so she can force Snow to eat the apple.

The only way that this ""makes sense"" is if we do not know how much time has passed when Charming was imprisoned. But I do not imagine it to be too long, yes? Snow already had the dwarves (and by that extension, the fairies) helping with the attack of the castle pretty much on the spot.

If that was the case, how does Cora know about the curse? The only way seems to be Rumple telling her way ahead of time. We know Cora's out of the picture since before Regina got her powers. 

At this point I'm not sure if I should try and make sense of the story, or just enjoy it as it is. The timeline seems a bit woozy. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;"	t5_2srt7	True
1361747116.0	195nuw	[Spoilery] Speculation from a Once... newbie	YetiBot	10	2	2	"Hi there! I just discovered the show and have watched everything available on Netflix and Hulu in a frantic rush (and now I have to wait painfully for new episodes which is both incredibly frustrating and wonderfully suspenseful). I am completely in love with this show. So. Much. Fun.

Anyway, I've also been reading some old rumor threads from this subreddit, and have a question/theory of my own I'd like to pass by you all. (Forgive me if it's been brought up before, but I didn't see anyone else mention exactly what I was thinking.)

In the second episode, when Regina goes to retrieve _the curse_ from Malificent, the spell is shown as having been kept in a crystal ball. That ball looks extremely similar to the crystal ball given to Rumplestiltskin by Jefferson in the episode ""The Doctor"" (when he fails to get the ""slippers"" from that same land). Malificent also says that she doesn't know who created the curse, only that ""whoever created that monstrosity makes the two of us look positively moral.""

So was the curse created by the Wicked Witch of the West? Or maybe even a collaboration between the witch and Dr. Whale/Frankenstein/Wizard?

Thanks in advance! Can't wait to hear opinions, even if you all firmly tell me I'm crazy. :D"	t5_2srt7	True

Rumplestiltskin is still looking for his son, that's what drives him, and it's nice to get reminded of this every once in awhile. but i think most of us have forgotten about the mysterious man in NYC, or just simply saved him for later in the back of our minds.

anybody else think that this man is Baelfire? i know i saw something about Bae being sent to another world 300 years before the current events in Storybrooke, but still, there is MAGIC involved. anything could happen. i strongly believe this to be the case, as who else could this man be? besides another character that we've been yet to be introduced, which i think would just be kind of stupid.

tl;dr, theory is Baelfire is the man in NYC from the season opener.

I know Horowitz and Kitsis were behind Lost, but I never watched Lost, so forgive me if my complaints relate to their writing style and I'm just not getting it.

From what I'm seeing now, there is just too many open storylines/unanswered questions.

We have the obvious:

1. Why did August do what he did in the past? Where is he now? What is he doing?
2. What did Neal do after he was abandoned by his father, but before he met Emma?
3. Why does Cora hate Snow's family so much?
4. Will Belle ever get her memories back? Will Greg Mendell become more important to the story?
5. Will Emma ever find out about Regina killing Graham?

To the less obvious/still unanswered/probably forgotten questions/storylines:

1. What happens to Prince Phillip, Mulan, and Aurora?
2. Where is Jefferson/Madhatter? Was he reunited with Grace? Probably. Did we get to see it even though they made us feel for him not being able to see his daughter while everyone was cursed? No. 
3. Where is Smee? Wouldn't he be helping Hook?
4. What happened to King George?
5. Do Nova and Dreamy/Grumpy get to be together now? Are they?
6. Do Abigail and Frederick get together post curse?


Random Questions that possibly only I have:

1. Why isn't Cinderella's Prince helping at all? 
2. If we've seen Dr. Frankenstein, why haven't we seen Igor in Storybrooke?

I'm sure there's other unresolved stories that I haven't listed, but my point is:

Isn't this too much? The show is starting to bore me even though I don't want it to do that. I feel like the show is just too busy with all this unresolved stuff. 

My big fear is that the show will get cancelled due to low ratings, and we will all be left hanging on just about everything.

1351118350.0	1216c4	[THEORY] All magic comes from fairy dust	gerald_bostock	5	0	8	"Think back to the oldest story we're told about in the series. That is, Rumpelstiltskin's. Now, remember that even in his early days as the Dark One, when Bae is still alive, the Blue Fairy is mentioned as 'the original power', the 'ancient being that rules the night'. Now, this might just be the hearsay (and it is), but it makes quite a bit of sense.

So far in the series, we've constantly been told that 'magic always comes with a price'. This is the deepest, most simple yet powerful rule of all magic. And so far, we've seen the cost. Yet this doesn't seem to be the case in the same way for fairy magic. Of course, there is a cost, and this is the life that the fairy godmothers and dwarfs have to lead, but there's also the fact that fairy dust seems to be pure magic. And this is where my argument comes from.

The theory is that somehow, way, way back, the blue fairy discovered fairy dust, and since then, magic has made its way into the world through her. Now, I'm not considering things like ogres and stuff magic because that's just their nature, but the ability to actually do magic seems pretty limited. Other than fairy dust, we have never seen an example of pure magic in either world (except for True Love). All the 'good' magic we've seen, at least, comes from the fairies.

And the 'bad' magic doesn't appear out of nowhere either. Magic seems to be like energy in physics- it gets converted into its effect, and there may be some left over, but it's not infinite. With bad magic, once enabled, the user can use their own 'soul' or humanity to fuel the magic, but it does seem that the user has to have this ability 'activated' in some way, i.e. becoming the Dark One, reading a book of spells, etc. It's not much of a stretch to imagine that the original Dark One was a fairy wish gone wrong (or right, depending on what you think of fairy morality), especially when the Reul Ghorm (the Blue Fairy) is known to 'rule the night'.

And so, from its very start magic comes at a price. The dwarfs mining it are essentially a brainwashed slave race whose only purpose is mining, and the fairies who use it are also limited. Now, I don't know how new fairies are made (whether there's a race of fairies and only some choose to become godmothers or whether they're also hatched from eggs), but we know that they, like dwarfs, are very limited in what they're allowed to do. Basically, to me it looks like there two whole slave races whose sole purpose is to bring magic to the world. That is the price of magic, and every time someone wants more, they have to eat away at themselves, because magic is a limited resource.

And finally that leads to another consideration- if fairy dust is the source of all magic, that means that it will eventually run out. So eventually all the magic left will literally just be the remnants of past spells and curses.

*If ""Happy Ever After"" did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick.*

And of course:

*Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me.*

*You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down.*

*I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed,
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun sets in paradise.*

1332805225.0	rezuk	Some Rumple questions...	malaia	4	0	7	"So my friend and I have decided to re-watch the first episode.  There are some questions we have about Rumpelstiltskin, that we can't remember if they have answered in any of the other episodes or not. 
1: Why was Rumple in jail during the first episode?  We are pretty sure we remember the jail being built specifically for him, but our memories have been weakened by our alcoholic state (lol).
2: What power does he have over someone by knowing their name?  The prison guard warned them of telling him their names.
3: What did he need to know Emma's name for, did it have some meaning to the curse, or is it so he can have 'power' over her?
