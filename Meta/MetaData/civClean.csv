1374887640.0	1j4vjq	It's official: Warmongering is bullshit.	Wigriff	1378	215	263	"I can't take it anymore. Warmongering is bullshit. The mechanic is broken. Period. There is no possible way anyone can argue to the contrary. I was already tired of being labeled a warmongerer for literally THOUSANDS of years for any sort of skirmish early on in the game. That was bad enough. 

The game that I'm currently in though? I haven't been in a war for the entirety of the game, with the exception of the time that my lovely neighbor Attila invaded me to try and take my capitol, because HE is a warmongerer. And, in true Attila fashion, he continued to warmonger the entire game. He was starting random wars with civilizations, demanding tribute from city-states, he TOOK OVER and puppeted two city-states, and just acted like a total douchebag. Every other civilization had denounced him and more or less hated him.

Atilla had been demanding tribute from a city-state I was protecting, and was taunting me about it, which irritated me. Brazil then approached me, asking me if we could finally deal with Attila once and for all. I agreed, and we went to war. Attila has about 8 cities, and I moved in and puppeted one of them...

And now I'm a warmongerer! Everyone except for Genghis thinks I'm a warmongerer. Hell, Brazil – THE PEOPLE WHO ASKED ME TO GO TO FUCKING WAR WITH ATTILA – say I'm a warmonger. I am the only motherfucker on the map who hasn't started a war with someone else for all of history, and I'm a warmongerer for dealing with Satan himself? 

Broken. Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken.

I *also* see intermediate-level players asking the very same questions, so I thought I should go ahead and answer them. In addition, some of the tips given in other posts are unhelpful or flat out untrue. **If you find yourself not doing as well as you expect and you don't understand why, this is the post for you.**

I myself am an Immortal/Emperor player (Deity just isn't fun for me) with 400 hours of play. *Note that the following tips are for the Gods and Kings expansion.* 

**MOST/MUCH OF THIS NO LONGER HOLDS TRUE IN BNW, KEEP THAT IN MIND**
--------------------------------------------------
 
&gt;**When do I go up in difficulty?**

This is a great question. The best way to gauge your ability to go up in difficulty is your ability to win through Science- you'll learn the military and diplomacy after you go up in level. The numbers below indicate when to move to the corresponding level from the previous. (these are just suggestions)

* Deity: turn 275 
* Immortal turn 325
* Emperor turn 375
* King turn 400
* Prince turn 425

&gt;**How do I manage my armies? I keep losing/I cant take that city!**

* **What techs to aim at for military (in this order):** Construction for Composite Bowmen, Machinery for Crossbows, Dynamite for Artillery, Industrialization for Gatling Guns, Flight/Radar for Bombers, Rocketry for Rocket Artillery, Mobile Tactics for Mechanized Infantry (*Sometimes, IGNORE THIS and go for UNIQUE UNIT: example is Mongols must go straight for Keshiks, Japan for Samurai, etc*)
* **What to build:** Here are the basic principles"":

1. Don't bother with melee units, mostly. Get all ranged units and 1-2 cavalry only if you plan on conquering enemy cities. Don't get siege units until Artillery (Dynamite Tech), just use Archery units. 

1. Tactic: set your ranged units all around the city and bombard it- keep a single mounted unit nearby (usually 3 tiles away from the city) to swoop in and capture. EDIT: Have a 1-2 melee units with Shock I, Cover II and Medic to tank bombardments. Keep him slightly damaged to bait AI attacks for easy capturing.

* **How to upgrade:** 

 1. Get the 3 levels of either the rough or open terrain bonuses (Shock/Drill and Accuracy/Barrage) 
 1. Now you can go for Logistics on ranged units, which lets you attack twice in one turn, or go for Range to extend your reach; for melee/infantry, get Cover/Medic to tank damage for your ranged units.
 1. NEVER get both rough AND open bonuses and don't bother with Cover/Medic/Seige, etc until level 6. The same principle works for naval/air units too.

* **Don't let your upgraded units die:** if you manage to get a unit to level 3+, do not ever let it die. Its very possible to get a level 7+ ranged unit by the end of the game with extra range, two attacks per turn, and automatic healing.
* **Great Generals:** once you get one, place it near your attacking units. Any subsequent generals should be used for Citadels- these tile improvements should be used offensively- put them next to the city you're attacking to form a stronghold for your units. Use them defensively the same way to make advancing troops die simply by walking near it.
* **City traps:** capture an enemy city, then move your troops out of it and let your enemy capture it. Then repeat. The AI will always waste their units to try to retake their lost city if you have nothing protecting it. Then you can just take it again. You can slowly pick off their units until they have nothing left, at which point you can take all their luxes/money/cities for peace.

&gt;**How do I expand early?**

* **Best build capital orders:** Scout-Worker/Shrine (if going full Tradition), Scout-Monument-Shrine/Worker (if going into Liberty), Scout-Scout-Worker (good for larger maps), Warrior-Warrior (not recommended- only on early game rushes). After that, build archers!
* **Recommended Early Tech Order**: Animal Husbandry-Pottery-Luxury Technologies - Archery. After that, go Library-Philo if you're on Emperor or lower, but go straight for construction on Immortal/Deity.
* **Steal workers**: plant a warrior near a neighboring city state. As soon as they build a worker, declare war on them, seize their worker, and immediately make piece. They'll hate you, but it will disappear fast. You can hopefully get 1-2 early game workers this way.
* **SELL!:** You don't want to waste time building, especially settlers. The solution is to buy your workers/settlers, by selling resources. Full guide along on how is here:
http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=468487
* **Settle:** on a hill if you can. Its better defensively and gives you better production. Also, if you settle on a lux you get it immediately if you have the appropriate tech.
* **Early military:** If you're Attila/Alexander you may want to spam Hoplites/Battering Rams and go conquering. Otherwise, have one archer per city and upgrade to Composites as soon as you can- save the gold. You may want 2-3 in border cities if you have an aggressive neighbor. 
* **Social policies:** See next section.

&gt;**How do I manage my culture?/What policies should I go for??**

* **Early game Social Policies:** There are 2 options here to go for:

1. Full Tradition: , Legalism, Monarchy (less unhappiness), then Landed Elite and finish up Tradition. Snowballs later with awesome growth on first 4 cities you settle. Probably the easiest too. (no building monuments!)

1. Liberty/Mixed: (optionally) Open Tradition then open liberty and go for Collective Rule and Citizenship for the free settler/worker. You can either finish liberty now or you can go back and do tradition. A great trick is if you have monuments built, Legalism in Trad can give you Ampitheathers; you can even get free Opera Houses this way. Good for culture games as a result.

* **What to avoid:** Unfortunately, civilization 5's policies aren't at all balanced. A few are good, some are awful. Overall tips:
 1. Never go Honor. Some people always try to make it work, but high level players will always tell you the same thing; it cripples you and stunts your expansion. Exception: VERY early rushes (&lt; turn 20)
 1. Never go Piety/Patronage. EDIT: They can be great too! Piety is often mandatory for culture wins and patronage is great too. But new players would improve simply by skipping them.
 1. Commerce is *okay* but its only worth it if Rationalism isn't unlocked. Otherwise, don't bother.

* **What you SHOULD use:**
 1. Tradition-Rationalism-Freedom (4 city science)
 1. Traditon/Liberty-Piety-Freedom-Tradition/Liberty-something (4 city culture victory, or if you just have a lot of culture)
 1. Liberty-Rationalism-Autocracy (military focused empire)

* **Some more tips:**

 1. Even if you decide to fill out Liberty, make sure you finish tradition if you're going for a small, tall empire (1-4 large cities). 
 1. Rationalism is the best tree, and must always be filled out. Closing it gets you 2 free technologies, so time that policy with your research for maximum efficiency. You can leave it unfinished and close it later too for 2 late-game techs. Example: finish Rat and use it to get Telecom and Globalization free to build UN for Diplo victory.
 1. Although I didn't mention it earler, Order is great too if you have a wide empire and you don't plan on winning domination. Planned Economy is awesome for science output. It just works on anything, you can substitute it anywhere.
 1. Every new city you own makes policies cost much more. Stick to 3-4 for best efficiency. Puppets don't count, but razed cities do. Never raze cities if you're going culture.
 1. Patronage is great to open and get Aesthetics. Then, if you pledge to protect you have indefinite friendship from city states! Don't go deeper unless you're playing Siam/Greece though.
 1. Piety is great but only if you're going for a culture victory. Otherwise, its not worth it since its nerf in G&amp;K. Then again, you might be able to make good use of it.

&gt;**How do I keep my Science output high?**

* **Maximize GROWTH:** Unless you plan to have lots and lots of cities, make sure your extant cities are huge so that they can sustain more specialists and population to add to science. How? 
 1. Prioritize growth buildings after science ones. Granary, Water Mill, etc.
 1. Make sure you always have enough workers. A terrible oversight is only having 2-3 workers by turn 90. You should have as many as you can handle, and build tons of farms. That will make your cities significantly larger by endgame.
 1. Always keep your empire happy. Prioritize happiness buildings after science and before growth if your empire is almost unhappy. (also gives +15% science with Rationalism)
 1. ALWAYS aim for Civil Service (extra food on riverside farms) and Fertilizer (extra food on all farms). Both are great techs. 
* Aim for Science Technologies in most conditions
* Make sure you use your science specialists. With Rationalism (and Freedom!) Specialists can give you 100-500+ science per turn on top of what you already have. 
* Settle your cities next to mountains if you can. That unlocks Observatories, which are +50% Science for that city.

&gt;**How do I cultivate my religion? (dont miss out on a religion in G&amp;K!)**

* How to start your religion: build lots of shrines early game, and select a pantheon that gives faith, of which desert folklore is the best. Other good ones are Fertility Rites (growth), Messenger of the Gods (wide science), and Sacred Waters (happiness).
* Founder beliefs: Ceremonial Burial/Peace Loving can be good for happiness, but Tithe is the most popular for the $$$
* Follower beliefs: Pagodas is the best for Happiness+Faith, Asceticism great too. Religious Community is great for smaller empires for production.
* Enhancer: always Religious Texts, but if its taken, ItPreachers or DefotFaith is good too.
* Its good to get a missionary before your second Prophet.

&gt;**Misc**

* Constantly check Demographics. Make sure you're not too far behind in Science, ever. (also soldiers)
* You can win easily Diplomatic by saving up gold, buying off 9 city states 2-4 turns before vote, and declaring war on every other civ so they can't gain favor with your allied City States (who they are now at war with)! Hint: build many Trading Posts.
* AI is irrational. They will probably just backstab you, unless they're far away.

Oops! I ran out of space! Part 2 anyone? (only if you guys ask me though!) Maybe I'll make a thorough Culture/Dom walkthrough! Oh, and please ask me your questions! I'll answer every single one!!

My first thought was ""Wow, if you're looking for converts to pacifism, you're in the wrong warzone"". Then it hit me - that was precisely the point. Kamehameha had spent the best part of his natural 4000 year Civ-leader lifespan in times of world peace and goodwill between nations. He'd never spread his religion much apart from in his own nation - he'd never felt he needed too. Now for reasons he couldn't fathom, the two great powers of the world were in a senseless conflict that was claiming hundreds of innocent souls. Ever since the construction of Big Ben and the adoption of Militarism, it was as if life was now cheap. He did the only thing he thought he could do - he sent his best and brightest into the heart of the inferno to try and end this madness and convince his former friends to return to the peace the world had once known. 

Unfortunately they got a bit close to a nuclear explosion and were wiped from existence. Kamehameha - some are born who are too good for this world, may you find peace in the next. "	t5_2rk3b	True

I then made privateers and a few ground troops to completely blockade all workable tiles by that city, both land and sea.


This way I controlled the population. I would move units off food tiles to let the city grow, and replace the unit to start to starve the city.


By water, I used the privateers (who had +3 upgrades vs City + 100% gold on DPS) to 'farm' the city's HP for $$$. With fully upgraded privateers, I made +50-+100 GP per turn almost, which easily covered the upkeep cost of the handful of units needed for the blockade and then some good profit. 



This way, I kept Songai in the game till the end, as my pet slave race. One that I would let grow, then farm back down for ca**$**h and e**X**p, usually leaving the city at 1 Pop with 0 HP, then letting it grow back again. 


He never stopped, you know. Askai. He kept pleading for peace. At one point, he offered me everything, like *everything* he had. I kept refusing.


I play big games with max players, so somehow he even managed to beg $**$**$ from other players to give to me. I refused. 



I did leave one hex open though. One hex onto where the city would occasionally pop out a unit, after toiling away for years of hammers. The unit would pop, usually a spearman (I once caught a great prophet!), and it would instantly get gibbed by the ranged units I had blockading the city. 



Once in a while, some spearman would get lucky though (Rng-gods) and somehow survive a volley from my blockading ranged unit. It would be left on that hex with like 1 HP left. Instead of taking the unit out, I'd leave it there to discover that the one hex it popped out onto is actually a hex next to one of my citadels - citadel attrition = gg. Next turn, the unit would attrition die. 



So that way units would pop, and die. All the while, my privateers raiding the city from time to time, and the soldiers outside camping your farms.


By the end, I'm pretty sure the Songai hated me. 


Funny thing is.. I won the game with diplomacy. Almost unanimous vote (except Songai ofc). "	t5_2rk3b	True

The mods here at /r/civ have noticed that the subreddit has recently reached 30,000 leaders. There are many upsides to having many people in a subreddit. More redditors can share their strategies and tactics, while asking and answering other people's questions, in order to make more people better. 

However, us mods and many people in the community have noticed that our laissez-faire view of moderation is not compatible with the growing subreddit. More and more meme-like posts and reaction gifs are being posted in /r/civ by newer members, and many established users have complained about them. I understand why they would be against these types of posts, because we don't want to see what happened to /r/gaming and its expansion happen here.

We have decided to put out a survey that is linked to in the green announcement bar above this post (in the Civilization subreddit). This survey will allow for the community to share their opinions on possible rule implementation in the subreddit. It only consists of 5 questions, so it won't be much of an issue to finish.

Thank you for participating in the survey and we really appreciate your input.

**TL;DR: Please take the short survey in the green announcement bar (in the Civilization subreddit) to give your input on possible rule implementation.**

1372351933.0	1h6s40	How Civ I Almost Got me booted from the USMC.	phuckcats	698	106	58	"Hey everyone, with all the posts about how Civ came about and Sid's story I thought I'd share one from when I first found the game. I joined the US Marine Corps in June of 1991. After boot camp and schooling in CA I was stationed with the 2nd FSSG in Camp Lejeune NC. Living in the barracks with 2 roomates.

Shortly after that I brought my Texas Instruments computer down with me to pass the time as I was working shift work and with a lot of down time during the day when most of my friends were working I figured I could get into a game. Shortly after that while perusing the local Radio Shack I stumbled upon a box with a pharaoh's tomb with a city skyline built on top of it. The game was called Civilization.

Having always been somewhat interested in history and playing RPG's growing up I figured I'd give this game a shot. WHOA. 

My nights turned into ""One More Turn"" agony for months on end when I was fighting off Shaka or Elizabeth. After a while others started to notice the game I was playing and asking about it. Within a few weeks of me purchasing the game it had been installed on at least 12 other computers in the barracks (sorry Microprose) and it was nothing for me to field questions about tactics or strategy all night long.

After two months just about everyone in the barracks were playing as well as guys from other barracks adjacent (French Creek area if you are familiar with Lejeune) to ours were also playing to all hours of the night.

I then got a visit from our Company XO who somehow had traced the game that was turning out Marines too tired for Physical Training and their job because they were up all night playing it to me, I was the carrier monkey per se. He told me to uninstall the game and if anyone asked me for a copy I was to say I lost it, or he'd ""destroy your career in the Corps.""

So, I uninstalled it but reinstalled it shortly after he left. I did however stop giving out the disks for people. 

So, there you have it, I've been a Civ Junkie since 91, it almost cost me my career in the Marines and I now have a wife that knows when a  new DLC or Expansion comes out, she won't be seeing much of me for a few weeks.

Thanks for reading.

TL:DR Picked up Civ I in 1991 and distributed it to an entire barracks of Marines who all got hooked and was warned to stop because the game was making everyone too tired. "	t5_2rk3b	True

When you set a military unit to escort a civilian, it moves to wherever that civilian is (adjusting if necessary if the civilian is also moving).  Once it's in the same square, it stays with the civilian.

If an enemy unit approaches, the military unit alerts (i.e. it becomes active) so the player knows something's up.  An escorted civilian will not stop what he's doing, because the escort's got his back.  So an escorted worker will not stop building an improvement if he's got an escort occupying the same tile.

An escort and its target will match speeds, so for example if you have a Khan being escorted by a pikeman, they'll move at the pikeman's speed.  If you have a worker being escorted by a knight, they'll move at the worker's speed.

The politics in this game were in need of a rehaul and that got me thinking ""Alliances and Defensive pacts can go further than ever before!"" So imagine if there was a code in the game, where if many civs declare war on one another, a little screen (Much like a wonder or new Age) that would show a world war was going on. Imagine if team 1, declares war on everyone on team 2. A little screen of painted troops marching off to war with ""World war 'x'"" (x representing the number of world wars fought up to this point) and some quote about war such as 

""We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.""-Winston Churchill.
or 

""If we don't end war, war will end us.""-H. G. Wells. There could be some milestone event, like ""Arms Race"" such as a golden age that increases production of military units. or an aftermath, where whichever team ""wins"" as in the other team presents them with a peace treaty another quote can pop up, and a short little golden age will pop up, such as ""Baby Bomoers"" with a major boost to population growth. Not to mention, at the end of the game, it could say ""World Wars won/lost"".

Original Post:

We are going to use this thread to create a good selection of Let's Plays to add to our sidebar for Civilization V. If you do't already know, a Let's Play is pretty much a playthrough of a game with commentary by an experienced player that can help you improve your own strategy. If you know of a good Let's Play, then you can make a comment with a short description of what it is, who made it, what difficulty it's on, and a link to the series. 

I will check back periodically and take good LPs that you have commented and add them to the post. Eventually, this thread will be added to the sidebar as a place where good Let's Plays can be easily found in a single link."	t5_2rk3b	True

I've had my eye on the game for a while, but haven't looked into it too heavily.

I've never owned a Civ game, so be gentle on my complete ignorance. Can Civ 5 be played ""casually""? What I mean by that is, is it normal to start a game, do a turn or two, leave for a couple hours, do another turn, repeat? Think of the mobile scrabble games that have been coming out. Do you have to sit there during the game or is it normal for someone to take 5+ hours per every couple turns?

Also, how noob-friendly is this game?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thanks for the advice, I think I'm gunna pick it up tomorrow after I turn in my last paper for the quarter!

Since you can stack workers with military units, you can pillage your enemy's tiles, then repair it, then pillage again, gaining 25 health each time you pillage. When attacking a city, this makes your units almost impossible for the AI to kill. And you get a small amount of gold each time you do it.

1375460490.0	1jkl7e	Suggestion: Be able to defy the World Congress	thefattestman22	375	45	91	"It's a simple enough suggestion, if the WC makes a decision you don't like, I think you should be able to defy their ruling. Say you're very powerful and don't like the host civ, and they embargo your friend. If you want to take the diplomatic heat you can go through a dialog and confirm you want to disobey the Congress. Perhaps the host Civ could take some action against you, like taking away delegates or banning you from the WC. Other civs in the game would also have an opinion, maybe they'd support you, denounce you, or be indifferent. Maybe if you defy an unpopular decision, weaker civs would follow your lead if you took action and refused to obey the WC. 

I sort of thought this might be a good idea when I was playing a long game and Washington embargoed city-states, I couldn't outvote him and everyone else abstained. I wanted to tell Washington, ""screw you, I'll trade with who I want"", and I was prepared for consequences. But, I was unable to break the WC's policy and couldn't trade with my CS allies for the rest of the game. I think an option of defiance would add depth to diplomacy, and make the WC leader have to make tough decisions with regard to how to handle such events."	t5_2rk3b	True

1375959707.0	1jy607	How a Great Prophet led to a civilization's downfall	pseudoduck	375	68	97	"Playing as Venice (Fractal map, Warlord, 8 Civs) to get a feel for them and I have a nice location on the coast of a large continent. Loads of City States nearby for when I need to expand; Celts in the middle of the land mass with only 2 cities, Greeks up north beyond more City States, Aztecs far away in the top right.

~~

Everything is going well; focussing on acquiring gold any way I can; any Wonder that improves gold or expands trade routes is a priority. I claim the City State of Ragusa on the south coast, through a well-brokers trade deal, hoping to expand my empire. The Celts found their third city of Cardiff a little north of a direct line between my cities. ""Hopefully,"" I say to myself, ""I can get my borders to join before Cardiff grows enough to split my Empire in two.""

I don't have a strong Faith, but I eventually get enough to found a religion and reap some of the benefits (gold from followers is enough if you don't plan on fully converting cities). The Celts found Catholicism and this quickly spreads to a lot of the other Civs on the continent. Because of my trade routes, I have a lot of pressure from this religion and the only thing keeping Shintoism alive is the Holy City of Venice.

And then I see a Celtic Great Prophet heading my way. I search through the diplomatic options fruitlessly, knowing full well there is nothing I can do to stop this guy, short of destroying him and declaring war on the Celts.

I think ""Maybe, just maybe it won't convert my City..."" though I already know the answer.

The Great Prophet of Catholicism preaches his message to the fickle citizens of Venice and they convert. Shinto's Holy City has fallen to the Heretics. I languish in despair for a turn as I check out what Catholicism can do for me...nothing as good as the benefits Shintoism had.

Something clicks within and I gather all of my troops and send them towards the newly founded city of Cardiff. Stationed on the border, all I have is a Swordsman and a Composite bowman (within firing range) and Cardiff is pretty weak, aside from the Pictish Warrior garrisoned there.

But, I have money. A lot of money. More than enough to buy a victory. Each turn, in Ragusa and in Venice I buy a Trebuchet or a Bowman and hurry to the border. I trade with the Assyrians and acquire some horses to build a couple of Knights, to assist in quick attacks.

""I've noticed a few of your troops quite close to our border,"" Boudicca remarks.

""Not to worry, I'm only passing through,"" I reply as my brain considers my options. They converted my Holy City to their false religion; I watched their Prophet advance and I sat by unable to do anything.

I take stock of the land mass. There are 4 City States on the main bulk. The Celts are in the middle. They have no allies. They're isolated. They're mine. I launch my war.

Thousands of arrows and burning rubble rain down on the city of Cardiff. In one turn I have decimated the city and taken it for my own. I set my sights on Dublin.

Buying more troops, I send some to the borders of Edinburgh, to keep the vicious Celts at bay while I march the bulk of my army to their Second City. A Celtic General is watching me from afar.

And then I remember: I had Bowmen north of Dublin to keep an eye out for Barbarians raiding my trade routes. Within 3 turns, they arrive and kills the General while his back is turned. My army continues the march northward. By this time I have 3 Trebuchets, 5 Composite Bowmen, a Swordsman and a Knight; all with their eyes fixed on Dublin. Another Trebuchet and a couple of Bowmen guard the borders of Edinburgh.

While I circle the City of Dublin with my troops, I buy and send some melee units to Edinburgh. And then I get a messenger:

Boudicca has a request for peace. She is willing to give me Dublin if I end the war. A nice offer in any other time, perhaps. I refuse the offer. ""Do not worry,"" I say sadly, ""this will be over quickly.""

All my ranged units attack both Dublin and Edinburgh. I lose my Knights to defence artillery from the cities but it does not matter. Each turn I rain arrows and flame down upon the Celts. I hear the screams of Catholics begging for mercy. The defences of Dublin fall. Garrisoned troops are all that remain.

The Pictish Warriors have spirit, I'll give them that, but they cannot defend against a hundred arrows. They fall, the last warrior witnesses my Swordsman marching into his city, claiming it for my own. He dies a broken man.

Edinburgh is surprisingly weak and cannot even stand against half of my army. I almost feel sorry for Boudicca as she approaches me one last time, saddened by the loss of her empire. I order my guards to remove her from my court. Bowmen march through the streets of Edinburgh, triumphant in victory.

I survey my army, the majority still very much alive, and spare a moment for our honoured dead. I look at my map; I will acquire the City States through less violent means. Shintoism may one day resurface, but until then I will contend with the less beneficial features of Catholicism.

Looking again at the strength of my army, I set my sights on the Greeks in the north. I consider my actions and muse to myself, ""So this is how religion starts wars.""

There are only two buildings in the game that have theming bonuses that allow artifacts - museums and the Louvre.  Other than that, all artifacts really do is clutter up my Great Work slots, potentially blocking other theming bonuses from occurring.

I know that I could choose to build a Landmark, but that's only worthwhile if it's in my territory... and let's face it, most artifacts are not.

Here are some ideas I've had that could have made the process more enjoyable:

1. Sell artifacts for gold.  It happens all the time in the real world.  The amount you get for the artifact depends on how old it is compared to the current era.
2. Use to generate science.  Universities study archaeological/anthropological digs all the time.  Allow the option to consume them for a one-time science boost (again based on its age compared to the current age).
3. Give it to the appropriate civ for a diplomatic boost.  Dug up a Wittenberg artifact?  Give it to Wittenberg, and get +20 rep with them.  Found a Greek artifact?  Give it to Greece, and watch your relations with them improve.
4. Give the option to delete artifacts that are cluttering up your slots.  If I just had a Great Artist pop, I may want to use him to hopefully fill out a theming bonus, which I can't do if my slots are filled with artifacts.

But to make things more interesting, I sold each city to different civ.

Now let's see the civ island survivor game!

EDIT: So, after few turns nothing much happened, except everybody started denouncing everybody. I installed a spy in each city, so I can see what's going on down under. Civs have no armies on an island yet, so we'll have to wait for a fight for quite a while.

EDIT2: To escalate things, I've decided to bribe one civ against other, bring bunch of troops on island and give them away proportionately to each civ. Breda and Nijmegen will get a couple of battleships and others land troops. Maybe even a nuke or two. Let the games begin!

EDIT3: Yeah, I can't give away my units to other civs. Just city states. So I have to change my plan. Is it possible to bribe a city state against civ? I can give a bunch of my units to Cape Town and Singapore and than bribe them to go to war with civs on island."	t5_2rk3b	True

I played as Venice on a random map type with everything standard. I started out on a small continent with visibility on two city states.I quickly bumped into Germany to my south and England to the east. I decided to do heavy trading with Germany and gave in a few times when he asked for gold or a resource. When the deal expired and he asked to renew it I just charged him. :-)

Up until ideology's everyone was declaring friendship, trading, sharing hugs, etc. Sadly, me, Germany, and Hiawatha went order. The other players went freedom. I actually went order because Germany did and we'd been such solid friends that I didn't want to ruin it. That's what led to my downfall last deity attempt. 

The first world congress was ran by England and Germany. I backed both of their proposals so everyone was happy and at this point I was making a ton of gold so I started buying up city states as allies. I wasn't able to get enough votes to win the host of the congress so I backed Germany. At this point England and the Swedish decided they hated me for order so they DoW. 

It does not go well for them. I'm small but I have several artillery, a great General, some infantry, and some subs. Using my hilly terrain and buying the city states around England we were able to destroy most of his attackers. I ask for peace but they both laughed at me so I did the reasonable thing and took England's city of York. :-) around this time I finally get selected as the host of the world congress. As a gift to Germany I choose order as the world ideology. It easily passes with just my votes. 

I also have to mention that England had taken one of my city state allies but the two other city state allies that surrounded it took it back for me. Awesome! 

Germany finished wiping England off the map and I failed to win the world leader vote the first time. However, Sweden gives me peace so I'm back to buying city states. I'm still a vote or two short but there's plenty of time left when I notice Persia is building spaceship parts rapidly. I'm able to convince Germany to go stomp him into the ground for 9 gold per turn. Best 270 gold ever spent. :-)

The turn before the vote I'm able to lock up the last two votes and the rest is history. I apologize for the rambling but the world needed to know of my conquest. Enjoy.

###The Iroquois (Hiawatha)

Starting Location Bias: Forest

**Unique Ability: The Great Warpath**

Units move through Forest and Jungle in friendly territory as if it is Road. These tiles can be used to establish Trade Routes upon researching The Wheel.

**Unique Unit: Mohawk Warrior**

* Cost: 75 Production/150 Faith
* Melee Unit
* Combat Strength: 14
* Movement: 2
* Replaces: Swordsman

The Mohawk Warrior is exactly like the Swordsman, except that it requires no iron to create and gains a 33% combat bonus in forest and jungle.

**Unique Building: Longhouse**

* Cost: 100 Production
* Maintenance: 2
* Production: +2
* Specialists: One Engineer 
* Replaces: Workshop
* Gives +1 production for each worked forest tile.

The two greatest strengths of the Iroquois are the fact that they save a lot of GPT by not needing roads until railroads are researched, and by the fact that they have a HUGE early military advantage thanks to the fact that the Mohawk Warrior needs no iron to be built. Of course, they’re very terrain dependant. If there’s no forest where they spawn, their bonuses are pretty much moot. Hiawatha’s AI is, in my experience, very expansionistic, friendly, and loyal. However, I can’t forget the time he tried to Mohawk rush me in the last game I played.

Fun facts:
Hiawatha is tied with Catherine for second most likely to build and use nukes.

By the time I had discovered iron working, they already had gunpowder. When I discovered gunpowder, they were already building monuments in space. It was unfair, and unfortunately, the only way to survive was by shady diplomacy. 

I had to rush to create a great world monument that promoted peace, and every other unit that I created was a diplomat. The opponents would break peace every few turns or so, and when they did I had to rush my diplomats to their cities to negotiate peace again. I had walls of soldiers outside of my cities to slow down the opponents; they were the barriers into my empire. I had no roads nor rails since any benefits gained from them would swiftly and efficiently be negated by the opponent's troops having the means to walk into my capital. Diplomats would go trade what little money I had for opponent's battered units and old technologies. 

My population was stagnant. I had few resources, my production was slow, and survival looked less and less likely as my opponents became more and more powerful. But damn it, that was my existence and I was determined to progress forward at any cost!

My people didn't have irrigation nor granaries but there was one weapon that could give our nation the respect that it deserved. So I bided my time, and as one of my so-called allies were about to conquer an opponent's city, I swooped in at the last minute and pillaged it for myself. But not without taking a technology from them - The A-Bomb.

While my opponents continued to war against each other, I was frantically increasing my nuclear arsenal. My diplomats and suicide soldiers continued to keep the opponent at bay. And then the moment came. To most people, the time that had passed until the moment would have seemed like an eternity, but when you are aware of its imminentness, it is as quick as a flash. The end-game had arrived.

My diplomats had done enough reconnaissance for me to know where to strike first. Within a turn I had conquered 3 capitals, destabilizing their empires and in some cases causing enough civil war to split their empires. I didn't stop there. I made sure to target their nuclear arsenals to avoid any kind of retaliation. I continued to decimate cities with my nukes. Some cities I would claim as my own, others were left inhabitable from the nuclear aftermath.

Now they were coming to me for peace. Little did they know that the fate of their empires was already sealed. My swift and destructive actions had not come without a cost though. As I was walking into the last few cities under infidel control, I noticed that many of my cities began to fall. No, it wasn't some miraculous starwars-like rebellion capturing my cities. It was famine. As the years progressed there was little fertile ground left on the planet. No doubt a consequence of nuclear war. When I had finally pillaged the last remaining opponent, I only had 5 or 6 cities of my own remaining, but I had done it. I had beaten the game.

Usually when you kill all your opponents, the game ends and that is that. But there was a glitch. Civilization had an auto-save feature that would save every hundred years I think. It just so happened that after I had pillaged the last remaining opponent city, the game autosaved. When I loaded the game, the only nation left on my planet was my own. This glitch happened so infrequently that this was the first time I had ever hit it.

For completeness sake I decided to play on. I advanced my nation technologically, sent my people into space, and build the roads that I had so feared in the past. But despite my best efforts, my cities continued to fall. The planet's temperature continued to climb and my people continued to starve. We had survived nearly a hundred years after the fall of the last opponent but all that was left was my beloved capital. This was the city from which my great empire began, and it was falling. Not by the sword of an enemy as I had always hoped but by circumstances that were now out of anyone's control.

I tried everything that I could. I built granaries and irrigation but what's the point when there's no food and water. My population dwindled. 2000 one year, 1000 the next. Until finally there was no one left. I had lost the game. 

Autosave. 

The first autosave glitch seemed like a blessing, a chance for my empire to live for eternity. This time around there was no sure blessing. When I loaded the game there was no sign of civilization. There were the occasional barbarians marauding about, but even they would eventually disappear. I just watched as every inch of the planet became uninhabitable. But what did it matter since there was no one left to inhabit it.

I'm positive that this save game still exists somewhere on one of my floppies, but I don't have the strength to look back and see the consequences of my actions. I simply continue to live my life, sighing every once in a while, remembering what I had done."	t5_2rk3b	True

Without further ado, here's the [Civ V, hotkeys inforgraphic](http://rodenbeek.com/preview/hotkeys.png).

And here's a [gianter version](http://rodenbeek.com/preview/hotkeys-large.png)!

NOTES

~~1) I changed ""Farm"" to ""Irrigate"" in honor of my favorite Civ, Civ I.~~

2) Retire is shoe-horned in with End Turn because I ran outta room.

3) The graphic is a god, a king, and a commanding officer to help segment out universal, civilian, and military actions.

4) Check back for updates, I'm sure there will be revisions!

------------------

Edit: Although it saddens me, I've changed ""Irrigation"" back to ""Farm"".

------------------

Edit 2: I have a conflict with route-to and railroad, can anyone confirm or correct these?  Some sources say R works for roads and railroads, which would make sense to me, but I'm hearing that railroads is actually alt-R from users

1360946939.0	18l56z	A New Game Feature Idea for Civ V	lessmiserables	323	61	72	"Here is an idea I have for Civ V:

A new feature called ""Goodwill."" It would effectively be diplomacy in numeric form, much like Faith and Culture.

How would you earn it? By being at peace. Every Civ you have an embassy with might generate, say, .2 Goodwill per turn. Having a Declaration of Friendship might increase it to .5 per civ per turn. If you are denounced or at war or just in contact but no embassy, you generate nothing from that Civ. I am not opposed to having buildings generate Goodwill, but it should not be the primary source. And of course policies, Wonders, UAs, etc. could enhance these numbers.

You could then use this Goodwill in negotiations. Need a sweetener for a deal? Add 100 Goodwill to it. Need to stop a war or start one? Throw some goodwill into the mix. The Goodwill would then transfer to the other civ (or, of course, to yourself.) This could represent advocating or vouching for another civ, or the effort to assuage tensions, or whatever.

And what could you sink this Goodwill into? Goodwill will now be the primary way to become an ally of a City-State. Money can still be used as before but it will be much less effective. 

A new Great Leader, the Great Diplomat, could be purchased as well. They could be used to, say, open up new options for City-State relations (change leader style, maybe? Or even type? Or open up more quests?) Perhaps even use it against a rival to force a peace treaty, but that may be too powerful. Or it could be used to erase diplomatic hits on your reputation. Or (maybe) take the place of the General for Land Grabs.

I am unsure if losing Goodwill per turn is a good idea (i.e. wars would cause you to lose Goodwill each turn). Maybe one-time hits for sneak attacks or caught spies, or the negative stuff simply erases your gains each turn but would never make it negative for the turn. I could go either way.

Thoughts? Concerns?

Edit: also, this could fundamentally change how a Diplomatic Victory is done.

Edit2: Thinking about it some more, Goodwill would be the only standard way to improve relations with a City State (plus the usual quests/Great Merchant/etc) and money removed as a standard option. However, the quests requiring money (bankrupt/project/etc.) would still apply.

Edit3: I get that ""Goodwill"" or Diplomacy can't be quantified in real life, but I don't see how it's a fundamentally different concept than Faith or Culture. And it can represent all sorts of things, including pressure and strongarming and backroom deals and other less ""goodwill""-ish things. I picked ""Goodwill,"" but it can easily be changed; I don't want to call it ""Diplomacy"" because that is already an existing concept in the game, and things like ""Influence"" or ""Political capital"" sound more like domestic policies then international. Still, it's not a name that is set in stone."	t5_2rk3b	True

I played a large immortal pangea game, and was forced into playing defensive to start, before I managed to puppet a couple of empires, turning the tide. In the late game, I met persia who had largely run away (30k gold, 1000gpt+, tech leader). I was planning on a science victory (seemingly the go-to simple victory for me), which Persia was also going for - and beating me substantially. 

Then Persia pops the UN - most city states allied with Persia. He would buy out any city state he lost instantly. I figured, well, that's game over. 2 or 3 days gaming comes to an end. Until I had a thought, wondering if the AI could possibly be so stupid... I sold Persia most of my empire, cities selling for 5-10k each as long as they were on his border... Draining him of all his money. Sold everything else (cities, resources) I had to destroy his GPT. Bought all of the city states with his money. Win.

This is taken from CvDiplomacyAI.cpp, CvUnit.cpp and CvPlayer.cpp.

&gt; Single unit's power = ((Power * (promotionLevel^0.3 )) * Current Health) / Max Health.

The game's formula to calculate a unit's **power** (different than **strength**) is complicated. In general, it's this:

&gt; melee: ((combat^1.5 * move^0.3) / 2 (ONLY IF THIS IS A SUICIDE UNIT) + 4000 (IF THIS UNIT CAN NUKE) + Promotion bonus)

&gt; ranged: ((ranged^1.45 * move^0.3) / 2 (ONLY IF THIS IS A SUICIDE UNIT) + 4000 (IF THIS UNIT CAN NUKE) + Promotion bonus)

The promotion bonus is stupidly complicated and annoying. Essentially it tries to take a percentage of the bonus each promotion gives a unit and adds and subtracts based on their value. In most cases it will only vary the +/- by a small amount. You're better off calculating each unit individually then posting the code. In general, the game attempts to group every unit's characteristics together to determine it's overall worth.

Let's take a Warrior who is level 2 (30 xp) and half health.

((**27.86** * (2^0.3 )) * 50) / 100 = ((8 * (1.23)) * 50) / 100 = 9.85 * 50 / 100 = 492.5 / 100 = **17.15** Total Power

The 27.86 comes from the revised formula above.

Relevant code:

    int CvUnit::GetPower() const
    {

        int iPower = getUnitInfo().GetPower();
        //Take promotions into account: unit with 4 promotions worth &gt; ~50% more
        iPower = int((float) iPower * pow((double) getLevel(), 0.3));
        iPower *= GetCurrHitPoints();
        iPower /= GetMaxHitPoints();
        return iPower;
    }

How to calculate player's current military might:

&gt; TotalUnitPower = Add every unit's power together, divide the unit's power by half if it's a naval unit.

&gt; GoldMultiplier = 1 + (sqrt(YourCurrentGold) / 100)

GoldMultiplier cannot be higher than 2 (will only happen if you have 10,000 gold).

Calculating might formula:

&gt; Total Might = (TotalUnitPower * GoldMultiplier).

Let's assume you have 2500 gold in your treasury, then the multiplier becomes 1 + (sqrt(2500) / 100) = 1 + (50/100) = 1.5.

If you then had 235 total unit power, the final might value is: 352.5.

Relevant code:

    int CvPlayer::calculateMilitaryMight() const
    {
    	int rtnValue = 0;
    	const CvUnit* pLoopUnit;
    	int iLoop;
    
    	for(pLoopUnit = firstUnit(&amp;iLoop); pLoopUnit != NULL; pLoopUnit = nextUnit(&amp;iLoop))
    	{
    		// Current combat strength or bombard strength, whichever is higher
    		int iPower =  pLoopUnit-&gt;GetPower();
    		if (pLoopUnit-&gt;getDomainType() == DOMAIN_SEA)
    		{
    			iPower /= 2;
    		}
    		rtnValue += iPower;
    	}
    
    	//Simplistic increase based on player's gold
    	//500 gold will increase might by 22%, 2000 by 45%, 8000 gold by 90%
    	float fGoldMultiplier = 1.0f + (sqrt((float)GetTreasury()-&gt;GetGold()) / 100.0f);
    	if(fGoldMultiplier &gt; 2.0f) fGoldMultiplier = 2.0f;
    
    	rtnValue = (int)(rtnValue * fGoldMultiplier);
    
    	return rtnValue;
    }

The AI always considers you to have at least 30 strength, so add this to the military might value. So in the above example, you now have 382.5 strength.

Now the AI takes a ratio:

&gt; Military Ratio = (TheirMilitaryMight) * 100 / OurMilitaryStrength

If we (the AI) have 250 strength and they (the opponent (human or AI)) have 500 strength, then the ratio is 200, if we have 500 strength and they have 250 strength, the ratio is 50.

Now the AI does checks based on this ratio. Keep in mind if one if is satisfied the ones below it aren't, so they can't be both POWERFUL and STRONG, only one.

If ratio &gt; 250, opponent is IMMENSE

If ratio &gt; 165, opponent is POWERFUL

If ratio &gt; 115, opponent is STRONG

If ratio &gt; 85, opponent is AVERAGE

If ratio &gt; 60, opponent is POOR,

If ratio &gt; 40, opponent is WEAK,

If it's less than that, opponent is PATHETIC

And that's how the AI determines its military strength vs. yours!

""Stupid Question: Don't Upvote""

This is done (as far as I can see) for two reasons. Firstly, there are a lot of first-world anarchists around on reddit, which is why these posts get a disproportionate amount of upvotes. So, some may use ""pls dont upvote"" as a way to gain more visbility. That is just irritating.

The other reason is that people don't think their post is ""good enough"" for the front page. Reddit is all about community and usefulness. If people have the same question as you, or think the question could provoke interesting discussion, they should (and probably will anyway) upvote it. If people think it is not beneficial to the sub they will ignore it, and if people think it is detrimental they will downvote it.

there is no reason to ask ""don't upvote."" It's not like there is a limited number of upvotes, and you are wasting them on this post. 

A quick search for ""upvote"" on this sub gives an absurd amount of these posts. One, a simple, instantly resolved question about multiplayer hosting, has ~1000 score, with the top comment being ""Don't tell me what to do.""

So please, people, *do* upvote questions, and stop with the formulaic ""Do not upvote"" line.

1376452677.0	1kbsps	The Death of a 5500 Year-Long Brotherhood (or why I love this game)	legendaryderp	278	40	27	"I started up a Pangaea game and rolled Korea. Start spot wasn't great but I was determined that *this* was going to be my map. Not even 5 turns into the game, I come across a Moroccan Warrior. I'd heard the stories of Morocco backstabbing you quickly, but I gladly took their offer of friendship only a few turns later. 

Not long after meeting Morocco, Sejong came across the infamous Montezuma and his hordes of heart-eating warriors. 

""Ahmad, Brother, we must prepare for a war with this beast""  Sejong says

""Not today, Sejong, we must wait, arm, prepare for his power spike to wear off""

And so they did. For a thousand years both of the great leaders alternated building units and culture buildings as they watched helplessly while Montezuma swallowed the Arabian nation like an insatiable beast. 

Cries for help fell on deaf ears as city by city was taken and razed by wild animals pitifully disguised as humans.

""Ahmad, we must go now, while he is over-extended and in the negatives for happiness""

He agreed, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers swept into Montezuma's lands only to be bitterly beaten back by the stalwart defenses of Aztec citizens. The few soldiers surviving crawled back to their home cities to lick their wounds and prepare for the inevitable counter-attack.

Korean and Moroccan Citizens and soldiers fought gallantly, keeping the inhuman masses at bay for more than a thousand years before a peace was settled. 

Once more, quiet descended on the land. The Brotherhood continued to trade and swap great works and support each other's resolutions until the year 1965, when the people of Morocco were the fourth of the six surviving nations to succumb to the guilty pleasures offered by the Korean tourism machine. 

Dictator Sejong had only one more nation to bend to his will: the cultured Aztec people. 

""All efforts to researching the internet!"" The excited autocrat barked at his scientists

And brilliant korean scientists slaved away at realizing their ruler's dream only to hear, with only 2 turns left on the Great Firewall:

""Montezuma has completed the Great Firewall!""

Tourism plummeted. A lamenting Sejong wept bitterly as he read that his brother, Ahmad, lay five hundred points ahead with a mere 15 turns left in the game. 

Suddenly, an idea so terrible, so dastardly, sprung into the power-mad leader's mind.

""We must be first,"" Sejong screamed into the void, ""the Korean People have worked too hard to be outshone by anyone""

The idea started as a funny little question a hundred years earlier, and ended up as the only remaining option before Sejong's eyes.

""The Moroccan People must be eliminated"" a tired leader whispered to his advisors.

""But you can't!""

""The moroccans are practically our people too!""

""We have to keep diplomatic options open!""

""***SILENCE***"" Sejong demanded, ""We will eliminate the Moroccan People as much as we need. Would you like to come this far only to be stopped by five hundred measly points?""

Heads hung around the table, the advisers knew that Sejong was right.

""Now,"" the Dictator continued, ""get me those scientists""

Six great scientists showed up in the People's Korean Palace. 

""You,"" Sejong addressed the men before him, ""are about to make a great sacrifice in the name of your nation. The People of Korea will appreciate and commemorate your sacrifice""

The Scientists were led to an archaeological site and systematically sacrificed before the God of War to ensure that the Korean army would be armed with X-Com squads, Nuclear missiles, and stealth bombers in the upcoming war. Keeping his promise, Sejong ordered his archaeologists to construct a Landmark to commemorate their keeping of their duty.

""Make it happen"" a deeply saddened sejong ordered his military advisor.

The Korean people flew into action, building great machines of death and misery while continuing to show the world the peace and happiness offered by their great land. X-Com squads were trained in top-secret facilities and flown across the globe discretely, subtly. A small 'misunderstanding' led to a city-state being used as a Forward Operating Base out of which the great missiles containing a hundred kilo-tons of treachery would operate. 

All of this was done quietly, secretly, with the constant threat of a second Aztec War taking place looming over the entire plan. 

In July of 2047, the people of the Moroccan Capital looked into the skies as a missile warning siren cleared them back into the public defense bunkers. The sad truth of these bunkers is that before a Nuclear Missile, God himself would beg for mercy.

The people were slaughtered wholesale as volley after volley of death came crashing into their hometown. Only after the killing had supposedly ended, and the people went to check that their loved ones still lived and their homes still stood, unfeeling X-Com squads descended from the heavens and finished the job the nukes had set out to do. Men, Women, and Children were lined up in the street, every other one being killed regardless of age, gender, or physical state. 

Sejong stared into the distance and saw tanks, artillery, and swarms of aircraft over the horizon. He elected to set off an older, less powerful Atomic Bomb to fend them off. The people of Seoul understood the necessity of their sacrifice as the bomb was detonated only miles from the city center. 

Sejong approached his brother, Ahmad one more time on turn 499. Nothing was said, no peace could ever be negotiated. Both of the former brothers lacked the words to even explain the treachery that had just taken place.

As the turn timer clicked over to 500, a very faint, tinny, bitter sentence left Sejong's mouth: *I've Won*.

Build up a strong navy, scout out the other big continent and find Dido and Alex still in control of their capitals with Alex trouncing everything. I use my navy to puppet a foothold on the coast and as soon as I take out the one Dido city, her capital, that was landlocked, the superior Alex, declaration of friendship and all and who was just bro-fiving me over our joint victory against Dido, declares war. Oh, and EVERY city state (about 12 left) declare too. Within 1 turn I lost about 30 units and my entire navy (3x 3 battleship, 2 privateer groups) It's a losing war and I lose all but 3 cities tucked in the corner. 


I'm able to hold them, but any move into the offensive is met with rocket artillery rape mobiles. With a 14 turn journey from my continent to the front lines I weigh my options against score and tech. Nope. Apollo program in full swing in Greece.


I rebuild my navy and use the standoff I get with them to pick away at coastal cities. Rape mobiles keep the inland locked down tight. I finally get a coastal city and 2 city states and Greece offers a giant peace agreement. I'm surprised he offered so much, but I need the 10 turns to get my units on the right side of the world.


Then comes the sneaky bit. **As soon as** I clicked agree to my 10 turn treaty the UN election screen pops up. 10 turns I can't attack him or city states and 10 turns to his victory.


Bonus epilogue:
So, technically I lost, but I reloaded my last save before agreeing. It came to me annexing the nearest city state, pushing my last battleship, GA, destroyer (vitally important; the only unit that can win the game) and sub into a bay with his entire navy.  A carrier makes it just in time with 2 A-bombs and a bomber. I sold my entire army enroute to buy an ICBM in my newly annexed city state. The carrier with the A-bomb's last move put the bombs' farthest range 1 tile away from Greece's capital. An ICBM, logistics double salvo from the battleship, 2 A-bombs and a suicide run from the bomber put the city down to a coin flip's chance of the destroyer getting through. 1 more turn would have lost me the election.


I won the redo, but holy crap balls that was clever of the AI.


**TL;DR**: Greece offers treaty as UN is completed and I can't attack to win before election is held.

**E:**

- I think it was on King difficulty. I haven't played in forever and was looking for something that wouldn't require an entire game of micro managing and would be relaxing (Spoiler: it wasn't).

- I did turn a blind eye to the city states. Most of my cash went into buying a majority of my initial navy.

- *May* have been a coincidence, but it lost me the first run-through.

- Spain, Carthage, Egypt and the Celts started over there. By the time I made it to the party Greece had taken Spain, the Celts and Carthage minus the capital plus all of what used to be the Egypt now under new management. Ramessess was still alive, but banished to some 2 population 4 tile island empire and kept calling me an asshole the whole time. He hated me, but found my luxury exports worth more than the moral high ground against my genocide."	t5_2rk3b	True

I started a new game on 'Prince' difficulty – which by no means is ever difficult for me. I was playing as Harun al-Rashid on the 'Play The World Extended (Gods and Kings Edition)' world map, and naturally started in the Middle East (Turkey to be exact) in a killer starting area. 

Then it all just fell apart...

The first Civilization I met was Babylon, who was in India. Almost immediately they began to kick the shit out of me. I had literally 3 troops and they roll in with an Army, and just began to siege my cities because of... reasons. I managed to fight them off, but it set me back.

As it turns out, I was surrounded by Darius, Isabella, Suleiman, and Nebuchadnezzar. Things just went downhill from the get-go. After Nebuchadnezzar made peace he seemed to really like me, considering he went to friendly almost immediately. I think he hated me initially because I had no military and he considered me to be weak. My only friend in the area was the guy who previously wanted to drink my blood because I was the scrawny guy.

Considering who my neighbors were, and the fact that Suleiman had been warmongering with Nebuchadnezzar already off-and-on, I decided to ask Nebuchadnezzar for a defensive pact to protect my hindquarters in case someone decided I looked tasty. BIG MISTAKE. 3 turns later Nebuchadnezzar went to war with the Ottomans, and within 10 turns after that he made peace. 

Suleiman offered me peace as well... for 1 of my 4 cities and 2000g, plus 5 of each of my resources for 30 turns. I didn't accept, and ended up being locked in a war with him for about 150 turns. You read that right. 150 turns. There was hardly any combat actually, but I had to boost my military and deal with him occasionally coming in with about 5 troops to cause trouble. I couldn't sue for peace because his demands were ridiculous. 

The next thing I know I am struggling to research Replaceable Parts, and Darius had completed the Manhattan Project... What the hell happened? lol"	t5_2rk3b	True

800BC. Dido and Nobunaga, my western and southern neighbors, DoW simultaneously. I trade every last luxury to Agustus to re-kindle an ancient rivalry with Nobu, distracting him while I pull together my ramshackle defense against Dido's army of war elephants.

I barely save my western border city, weakening but not destroying Dido's forces, when they suddenly gallop past, on their way across the open plains of the heartland towards my mostly undefended capital.

I'm boned. I watch in horror as they approach, my empire burning, my happiness in the negative double digits, there's no hope.

And right as the horde of Carthaginian war elephants are within a turn of attacking, an huge rebel uprising (spearmen) springs up around the capital city intending to take over, but instead find a bigger fight on their hands then they expected.

They wipe each other out. Almost completely, they were so evenly matched. I clean up the remnants with my lone kris swordsman.

We eventually recovered and went on to win the super bowl, or whatever.

I'm about to invade polynesia, and I only annexed tyre. Everything else is puppet. I can still win a dom victory, because tyre is considered my original capital, as opposed to losing it with the settler. I am catching up on science after 100 turns without any science, in part thanks to an academy built by persia. Plus, the Mayans built the great library, giving me a 3 science bonus.
TL;DR: Try the Germany challenge. It is awesome! 

Update: I got to Iron working, built Berlin (my 7th city because of all of the puppets) on 6 iron and next to 2 silks and 1 dye. I upgraded 6 of my brutes, mined 14 more iron from the Persian cities, and I'm about to take Siam. That will be 3 down, 8 to go!

I was reading through the civ of the week thread and saw a lot of people comment but I felt like it didn't capture the true power of Montezuma so I felt compelled to make this post. (Sorry for my dark humor ahead of time.)

He. Is. A. Beast. 

All you have to do is war war war and start more war. When the world is burning and in constant war, Montezuma thrives. 

I dare say that no civ thrives from war like the Aztecs. They make Hitler and his German war machine look like a neutered puppy. America's shock and awe? More like shock and not enough death and sacrifice... 

Before I began my game I chose a terra map with 20 deity ai's and 15 city states on marathon speed. (Marathon speed is key here because it gives me time to travel with my jaguar warriors across the map and accumulate ridiculous amounts of culture.) 

I essentially started in a mediocre location this game... without any freaking lakes as usual -fml- and this is by no means my best Monty game because I was playing it safe since I was recording and it was also my first game in a long time so I forgot to promote my units properly...which set me back quite a bit... I usually get way more culture and go pure honor for the gold but this game I focused more on my economy and went with the liberty branch as well as honor. 

I started next to plains, forests, and jungles with a few hills and a river. On the bright side I got 2 different luxuries. I immediately began producing jaguar warriors. I found Sweden and declared war on them while exploring the map. This is what my turn 90 looked like:

http://i.imgur.com/q3sMUoX.jpg

As you can see Stockholm gave me a huge hard on because of the awesome location, but they built city walls and the city was located on a hill so I had a very hard time and decided to go elsewhere. I wanted the city for all it's jungle tiles, it was going to be my research center late game so I absolutely HAD to get it. 

Since I discovered some other civs I thought it was time for a change of plans. Sweden was done anyways. I drained them for every little bit of culture I could and stole all their workers and second city. I then turned my attention to France and Ethiopia. Both civs had NO defense. 

I decided to target the Ethiopia first because their capitol was right next to mine. A foolish mistake on their part, Ethiopia should have known better than to try to expand in my lands. 
 
By turn 139 Ethiopia was begging for peace. Here is what turn 139 looked like: http://i.imgur.com/j5nCnqR.jpg

If you notice, I control 3 cities and I'm about to get my second settler. I'm also at war with half the world. Now I assume this situation deserves an explanation. All those countries at war with me? I started those wars by robbing them of their money by offering luxury trade deals I had no intention of honoring. Then I used their money to fund my awesome war machine. That is how I have so many units. At this point my civilization is still fairly small but after I defeated the Ethiopians I founded 2 more cities and began making peace. 

IRONICALLY after destroying Ethiopia all of those countries ended up giving ME concessions for peace. I got some sweet items like luxuries and gold per turn and gold in general, I was LOADED with cash. Most importantly the peace treaties gave me a 30 turn window to decimate France. So in essence, I juggled my wars and each time I profit immensely from them. 

This whole game I barely managed my capitol city or any city for that matter and I have more gold, units, and cities than any diety computer in the game at the moment. (I assume, I can't know this for fact.) Although if you look at demographics I'm probably in last place in almost all categories besides land because my cities aren't really producing or doing anything. This is pure diplomatic/military domination right here. If I wanted to manage cities I'd have pick the Egyptians.

After making peace with almost everyone I could, I quickly headed north while deploying both my settlers and building 2 forts. One on the southeast side of my empire and one all the way north by the French. I had to build a fort between me and the Spanish as well to discourage them from invading, I wouldn't be able to handle them without my fort either because my army is always away in distant lands slaughtering and sacrificing innocent people.

It was when I declared war on France that the world finally said ENOUGH. I couldn't make this up if I tried - America and Britain declared war on me that same turn. Then the rest of the world followed. IT WAS WW2 IN THE ANCIENT ERA!!!

Even before I could rob them of their money every country declared war on me... Except for the nations that I signed peace treaties with. They were all WAITING for the peace treaty to expire to declare war. 

Luckily the French had no city walls and their cities were basically located on flat terrain. It was easier to conquer France than Ethiopia. It was as if the French just straight up surrendered or something. I dunno, it was pathetic. After conquering France I was stuck in a very long war with everyone else. Who all ended up giving me some of the most generous peace treaties I've ever signed.

This is what the world looked like on turn 214: http://i.imgur.com/NJrBbEK.jpg

Notice Blood Desert and Arbalast? Those are the two cities I used my 2 settlers on. It was a very bloody time period. I had to essentially turtle and defend myself from all sides while using that time to build myself up economically. I was also running out of happiness so it was time for ethnic cleansing... And yes, I destroy my own cities and rebuild them lol. Actually Orleans, Harar, and Sigtuna had horrible locations and they pissed me off so I destroyed those 3 cities and replaced them with my own cities. It was a purely strategic decision...

America is still at war with me. After I conquered France America never really forgave me, maybe because France gave them the statue of liberty? A common theme through out the game is war with America. It's as if they hate tyrants or something. 

Anyways, me and America were stuck in war, eventually I made peace. Than the Arabs invaded, then Byzantium, etc etc. 

Before long another world war broke out and I ended up on top through a series of military campaign. Luckily all the randomly timed peace treaties prevented me from having to fight everyone at once.

Eventually Spain gave me Barcelona. I took Mongolia's capital and the Arabs gave me Damascus. AND I FINALLY MANAGED TO TAKE DOWN STOCKHOLM!!! Luckily not a lot of damage was done to the jungles. (When I say gave, they literally gave me cities for a peace treaty.)

Here is the map on turn 336: http://i.imgur.com/1VMPSrt.jpg

Hilariously, this is EXACTLY why people complain about AI in this game. Notice how America sent all its archers to Damascus and all infantry to Karakorum? I wrecked all those units.

The conflict between me and the U.S. basically escalated to cold war status. Britain and America were my top rivals trying to destroy me along with the rest of the world. By this point, pretty much everyone not at war with me was afraid of me because of the existential threat I posed. 

At this point in the game London had more world wonders than any city in the game by a wide margin and they have been my goal for a long time so I began to rapidly advance east. I started by conquering Byzantium but had to give Constantinople to the Arabs because I didn't have enough happiness to manage it. Me and the Arabs share a religion and they are on friendly terms with me so I decide to throw them a bone.

After Byzantium fell, I was finally knocking on Britain's door. And this is where I am currently in my game.

Turn 396: http://i.imgur.com/682APMJ.jpg

p.s. 

All my infantry began as Jaguar Warriors. They all gain health upon killing units and ignore jungle and forest terrain cost. I don't really need anymore infantry so the only thing I'll be making is artillery and archers from now on. I have 17 jaguar based infantry and 2 pikemen. Most of my units are levels 5-10+ and most of my archers have 3 range and 2 attacks through promotions because they had to deflect so many hordes of enemies. All of whom were promptly sacrificed for the glory of my gods. I'm one of the most cultured civilizations in the world haha. 

p.p.s.

I actually recorded the whole game on fraps if you guys want I can upload it on youtube, just let me know! (I'm too lazy to do it unless I get requests.)

p.p.p.s.

I don't go for any specific victory, instead I try to fulfill all victory conditions at the same time. I like to dominate culturally, scientifically, and militaristically. For me, it's about the process of building a great civ, not the victory itself. I find it odd that people aim for specific victories, but I guess those strategies are more geared towards human players.

I would assume a prevailing frustration with many players is the AI's seemingly ""random"" assignment of whether or not you're a warmonger. Well, now I'm going to make this post to tell you EXACTLY why the AI thinks you're a warmonger.

This calculation applies to gods and kings. AI handles things a bit differently in vanilla...

First, before I begin, I want to clarify how the AI currently cares if you've attacked/conquered another player:

- The AI has met the player conquering/declaring war.
- The AI can't be at war with the attacked player (they like it when you help them out with mutual wars). Only applies for declarations of war, not conquers.

Okay, now that we have that out of the war, here's a simple chart that shows how much base (not modified) weight an action has to the AI:

- Conquered a Civilization: +10
- Conquered a City-State: +5
- DoW a Civilization: +5
- DoW a City-State: +5

Everytime you perform one of these actions (and the pre-existing conditions are met), it'll add that to your base ""warmonger amount"".

The AI really cares about your warmonger score, and that's a very simple calculation:

- Warmonger Score = warmongerAmount * [warmongerHate](http://i.imgur.com/vRUIU.jpg)

A pretty simple calculation which ensures that AIs that hate warmongers will view you as a warmonger more than AIs that don't.

Every turn, your warmongerAmount will decrease by 0.05. This means that it'll take 200 turns for the AI to forget that you've conquered a Civ, and 100 turns for the AI to forget you've conquered a city-state, or declared war on either type.

Here's what your warmonger score will look several turns after an action:

After the AI's calculated your warmonger score, it does a simple comparison:

**Warmonger Threat**

- Score &gt;= 200: Critical
- Score &gt;= 150: Severe
- Score &gt;= 100: Major
- Score &gt;= 50: Minor

**A small addendum, the AI will also do a calculation based on the number of civilizations you've conquered vs. how many were ever alive in the game. This will help evaluate your threat on smaller maps.**

**Usage of your Warmonger Threat:**

1. AI will warn you about your warmonger after Severe.
2. AI is more willing to team up against a high warmonger threat player
3. Your score divided by 2 will be factored into the AI's opinion of you, if your score 10 or higher. This will then show up in the opinion box.
4. Your Foreign Advisor will warn you of their warmonger threat (at least, she's supposed to, I never use advisors, does this happen?)
5. Warmonger threat influences Guarded/Afraid Approaches.
6. A higher warmonger threat means the AI values you as a military threat more

Maybe this will shed insight on how the AI views you as a warmonger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone's curious, this is the **vanilla** calculation:

- conquering a minor and major are both worth 10 points.
- attacking a minor and major are both worth 5 points.
- once again, they're multiplied by warmonger hate.
- No decay. The AI will **never** forget your warmongering."	t5_2rk3b	True

My territory sat in between them, so I opened borders with Dido so she should get her troops across.  

I had a few road tiles that were connecting cities but outside of my territory (border expansion is sloooow in marathon).  As Dido marched across she pillaged them and broke multiple trade routes, costing me gold and happiness (from Liberty).   Since it wasnt in my territory it wasnt an act of war, and she effectively set me back several turns by sending me into negative gold/0 happiness from the loss of a trade routes.

1365567197.0	1c1j8i	Why America is my favorite Civ in the game - Patriotism has nothing to do with it!	imlykinit	254	39	69	"A lot of people were surprised that America was so popular in the [poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mTSXp7rUN1T3javxTUIiYwCg89C8gyARJU2ZLlj9h40/viewform) posted a few days ago on this subreddit. I'm sure a lot of it can be chalked up to blind, 'MURICA FUCK YEAH sentiments (that was the reason America was the first Civ I ever played), but I think that upon further investigation it is obvious that America is a top tier domination civ. It's strength is that rather than giving you a brief period where you have a military advantage that you are forced to make the most of, America's abilities help you throughout the game in a gradual build up to absolute late game dominance. 

Early game is largely dictated by the UA, Manifest Destiny. Lots of people don't like this UA - they don't buy tiles and the extra sight seems underwhelming compared to what else is out there. I disagree: the extra sight will allow you to be that much more effective when initially scouting out the map - this means more ruins, more city state gold, and more knowledge regarding where to settle. Use the bonuses from your ruins to expand aggressively and gobble up all the good land. Buy units for defense using your gifts from city states. You're going to need a strong empire with good cities to power the war machine, and more importantly, you need to keep the best spots away from your enemies. This is where tile buying comes in - by strategically purchasing tiles in choke points, you can block off enemy expansion and entice them into declaring war on you without diplomatic penalty! There is no reason why you shouldn't have the best empire on your continent by the time the initial land grab is over.

When you hit the Renascence and everyone is good and settled in their land, it's time to start putting that empire of yours to work getting a massive snowball rolling that will become impossible to stop. The minuteman looks kinda mediocre at first, but the tactical freedom a gunpowder unit with the movement and vision of a scout gives you cannot be overstated. They even come with a free promotion to boot, putting you on the fast track to march/blitz (if you're going to build longswordsman in the medieval era give them the shock promotions; don't waste your free Drill I upon promotion). You'll be able to waltz your siege lanes right on up to cities and take them with minimal casualties. Don't believe me? Fight a war with minutemen in rough terrain and then try going back to standard units. I know I had a hard time making the transition. The icing on the cake is that unlike other UU's that go obsolete, the minuteman will keep it's extra movement as it's promoted - riflemen, GW Infantry, and Infantry keep all the tactical advantages that unhindered movement gives you. When you hit mechanized infantry (hopefully with march at this point) with their three movement points, you'll be steamrolling any land units you come across. Use your land army to secure a source of oil and prepare yourself for...

The B17 Flying Fortress. If any unit has the power to singlehandedly topple that massive runaway Hiawatha on the other continent, it's this one. Not only is it only two promotions (read: barracks + armory) away from double attacks right out of the box (Cho-ku-nu? That's cute.), it also comes with 50% resistance to interception. Anti Air? Please. Air repair, which improves your survivability even further, is only one promotion away. This comes quickly when you get to attack twice per turn. Nab the Brandenburg gate and build a military academy and you have a unit that starts out with FIVE promotions. Every B-17 you build in that city will have the same tactical effectiveness of 3-4 normal bombers, since you attack twice as much and stop to heal half as often. Don't be afraid to build GW bombers early on - give them the bombardment promotions and you'll have an excellent hybrid attacker when it comes time to upgrade. You'll be able to use them to help clear out any ground based AA once Evasion comes online. Bomb the enemy into submission, and swoop in with your minutemen turned infantry for the kill. It's amazing how quickly cities fall, especially once you get the third siege promotion. The only downside are those damn animations! You might wanna turn on quick combat. The only civ with the power to stand in your way is Japan and that cursed Zero with Bushido, but if you're facing large stacks of those you might want to consider taking a lesson from the history book and deploy a bomber with a different sort of payload... If you don't understand what I'm getting at, ask Gandhi. He'll tell you.

In summary, America is a great civ because the UA helps you to set up a solid empire in the early game, which transitions into the Minuteman as you start start pushing your borders outward through conquest in the midgame, before finally leading up to the B17 which secures your unflinching late game dominance. Unlike other domination civs, you are strong for the entire game; there is never a moment when the Americans sit back on their heels and ""ride it out,"" waiting for their era of dominance (like China and Russia), you don't need to pigeonhole yourself into a special type of terrain (like the Inca or the Aztec), and you don't just coast along on the coattails of early game conquest (I'm looking at you, Attila). In fact, a lot of the aforementioned ""domination"" civs might find it tempting to settle into their comfortable empires after conquering a few enemies and take a science rather than domination victory. With the B17, the thunder never stops and there is no reason not to steamroll the entire world. 

NOW can I get a 'murica fuck yeah? Thanks for listening.

**BIG EDIT:** According to ScLi432, the woodsman promotion actually doubles movement through rough terrain rather than simply removing the penalty! This is HUGE! Minutemen with the ability to move up to four tiles in one turn will absolutely SHATTER enemy lines! No ranged or siege unit is safe! Flanking bonuses everywhere! The woodsman promotion is pretty damn good to begin with (it's a 3rd tier promotion after all), so the fact that it stacks with the Minuteman's 'ignore terrain' promotion is analogous to a Chu ko nu that can get a third attack, a Longbowman with 4 range, or a Carolean that heals 20 hp every turn! The next time I start a new game I'm gonna try postponing rifling till I get the Brandenburg gate up and pump out a whole slew of supertroops!

1375302357.0	1jg1bx	I've got this silly conspiracy theory...	Flying__Penguin	269	60	87	"I was always a little perplexed by the beginning of a new game in Civ V. You choose your leader, start the game, and it begins by giving you a little blurb about the leader you're playing as, telling you some of their accomplishments, what they valued as leaders, what they're known for, etc... 

And then it says something along the lines of ""Noble such-and-such, your people look to you to **once again** lead them to honor and victory.""

Wait, ""again""? Do you mean to say that we're taking as a given that all that historical stuff actually happened in this existence, that I was born, ruled a nation, died, and now I'm going to do it all over again? That doesn't make any sense.

And come to think of it, what's with these ""ancient ruins"" that seem to be scattered all over the world? We're supposedly starting out at the beginning of civilized humanity (as marked by the development of agriculture); nobody on the planet has yet discovered bronze-working or masonry, and yet here are all these ruined stone buildings lying around, chock full of advanced technological secrets and undiscovered weaponry. What gives?

So here's my theory: This game isn't actually an alternate-universe history. It actually takes place in the far-flung future, where humans have all left the Earth to live on space colonies, or aliens came and wiped out almost all of humanity, or all other sentient life on earth has melded into a single non-corporeal intelligence, or whatever. To entertain themselves, these advanced beings travel back in time, pluck great leaders from out of history moments before they die, revive them through the use of super-advanced medicine, and then force them to compete for dominance on an artificially groomed planet.

This explains the blurbs at the start of the game: The ""narrator"" is actually acting as the emcee, setting the tone for the game and filling in the spectators on the different competitors and their history. The ancient ruins are either spots that were missed by the terra-forming, or are planted there by the game masters. It also explains how all the leaders can apparently be kept alive and healthy for thousands of years.

**Tl;dr: you aren't actually playing a game about an alternate history planet Earth, you're playing a game about people playing a game about alternate history planet Earth**

1370288906.0	1flnr8	Note: AI does not have knowledge of resources on a plot if they can't reveal that tech yet.	Putmalk	254	44	49	"After reading this comment 

&gt;I'm fairly sure the AI can 'see' where the strategic resources are. And settle accordingly, wouldn't be surprised if there's some Uranium under there.
Source: I think I read it this one time but can't be sure

I figured I would clear this up for everyone.
Note: this evaluation is for gods and kings.

It took a ton of digging but I finally found the function in CvPlot.cpp:

    ResourceTypes CvPlot::getResourceType(TeamTypes eTeam) const
    {
    	if(eTeam != NO_TEAM)
    	{
    		if(m_eResourceType != NO_RESOURCE)
    		{
    			CvGame&amp; Game = GC.getGame();
    			bool bDebug = Game.isDebugMode();
    
    			if(!bDebug &amp;&amp; !GET_TEAM(eTeam).GetTeamTechs()-&gt;HasTech((TechTypes)(GC.getResourceInfo((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType)-&gt;getTechReveal())) &amp;&amp;
    			        !GET_TEAM(eTeam).isForceRevealedResource((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType) &amp;&amp;
    			        !IsResourceForceReveal(eTeam))
    			{
    				return NO_RESOURCE;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    
    	return (ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType;
    }

No, do you don't have to read that mess. It's horrific. But this line (once again, I don't expect you to understand it):

&gt; !GET_TEAM(eTeam).GetTeamTechs()-&gt;HasTech((TechTypes)(GC.getResourceInfo((ResourceTypes)m_eResourceType)-&gt;getTechReveal()))

means that if the team doesn't have the tech to reveal that resource, the function returns nothing, which means a resource doesn't exist.

When the AI computes it's settler values, it checks each plot around the plot it's thinking about (may I point out that that this can quickly get up to the hundreds/thousands of calculations...) and assigns a value to them. When it checks resource values, it calls this function to see if the plot has this resource, but since they can't see it, the plot has no resource.

Therefore, the AI does not cheat and look at resources when evaluating settler positions.

If anyone's curious, functions can be found:

So I've been experimenting with new ways to play Civ, as I find that almost every game one of two things will happen: 

1. I get bored by the middle ages and quit.
2. If I'm having a great game, I start hitting the ""next turn"" button so fast in anticipation, before I realize it, half the game is over and I have no idea what just happened.

To combat this, I decided that every 10-15 turns I'd stop, take a screen cap, and write a history of what's happening.  Some screen caps turn out to be nothing special, others really capture a great moment in your Civ history.  

For this game, I decided to play as Carthage on a small sized terra map, 6 opponents/10 city states, king difficulty.  Raging barbs is on, as well as no diplomatic victory.  Mods on this were RED graphic modpack, and extended eras.  

I didn't set the game off thinking ""okay,this time all science"", or ""I want a cultural victory this time"" - rather, I just wanted to play and see how it turned out.  This is what I got through today, before work and my impending hurricane doom."	t5_2rk3b	True

Edit for story:

I won't go into great detail since it's not super exciting.

It was huge continents, dom only, I was Japan. I got off to a really good start, then Wu and Gandhi both backstabbed me the same turn, cunts. Whatever, fend them off. [Then Wu settles in the exact spot I was going to 1 turn before me.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvca1nmCEE1r3tnkq.gif) I DoW her once peace is up and attempt to take the city. Pacal decides to march over and snipe it from me. I rage, take out his army and finally take the city. Wu offers her other city in peace treaty. During peace with Wu, I try to get Pacal to back off but he has caught up to me. Gandhi has also decided to DoW me so I am fighting on both fronts. Gandhi pulls back after Russia goes after him and I snipe Bejing from Pacal. China is now out of the game. 

All while this is happening I get notifications that civs are losing their capitals left and right. France and Russia are beginning to dominate. Fortunately Russia is on the complete opposite side of the continent from me behind Gandhi and Napoleon is on a different continent. They are both friendly with me. I build up an army to invade Pacal and then it happens... **I nuke Beijing trying to select a different unit.** I don't know why I didn't realize I had nuke up, probably because it was so late/early?

I retire because it was bedtime and I wasn't sure how I managed how to do that. 

End game scores: France 3x my score, Russia 2x, me in a distant third, and Pacal bringing up the end.

Here's mine:

* If you zoom in far enough, you can see which way a river is flowing, making it easy to find the coast.

* A mountain-themed natural wonder counts as a mountain for constructing buildings/~~wonders~~.

* Logistics makes it so you can move after attacking. This can turn naval units into deadly hit-and-run machines, and is much more useful than upgraded range for them.

* Carthage can build roads on mountains, making fast paths that only you can take. Your worker will probably die, unless you move it every other turn."	t5_2rk3b	True

NorthBus	252	40	114	"A long, epic game on a Normal map eventually led to the existence of only two major superpowers, each ruling one of the world's two continents -- Askia in the west and Alexander -- myself -- in the east.  Askia ruled through military might and an expansive empire while Greece ruled from four hyper-cultural cities and a host of puppets, friendly mini-nations, and allied city-states across the globe.  

Relations between the two superpowers were tense, but a vast ocean between us helped to cool any thoughts of belligerence... Until Askia began to declare war on Greece's allied city states.  The first city-state -- one of two in an isolated southern peninsula -- fell to a blitzkrieg of units unsurpassed in the history of the world.  The army kept its momentum and rolled towards the neighboring second.  Fearing Askia's might and the cost of a massive war, I sent the southern Contras what aid I could under the table, but it appeared to be too little and too late.  

Though their blood was Monacan, Korean, Singaporean, and Brasilian, their hearts were Greek, and so Alexander demanded with all the diplomatic weight he could bring to bear for the aggression to stop.  But my demands were rebuffed and nothing, it seemed, was to deter Askia's lust for power and riches.  

With little choice before me, Greece's High Council declared war on Askia and sent my navy and air force to defend the city states.  There is only so much that bombardment from afar can do to deter such a vast infantry, and soon the second city-state fell to Askia's waves of men.  

The fate of nations is decided, as it so often seems, behind closed doors and by men whose countenance gives the impression that the globe of Atlas lay upon their shoulders.  A decision was agreed upon by the leaders of Greece -- birthplace of the world's greatest arts, music, and culture -- that the Songhai menace to their brethren must be stopped at any cost.  The four cities of Greece simultaneously began their efforts, and by the end of the decade, a lone carrier and its escort fleet set out for the narrow central isthmus of the Songhai continent, where the great capital Gao stood in all its glory.  

The Songhai army was marching northward in tight formation, having completed their conquests in the southern pinensula, when the bombs were dropped.  Three new blazing suns rose over the region to mark the end of a centuries-long era of world-wide prosperity and culture.  As the smoke cleared and the true sun illumnated barren fields and cities, a frightening new era began.  Man's innocence is forever lost.

1369331503.0	1ewzo9	A modest (yet somewhat disturbing) proposal for Civ: Diseases.	skepticscorner	260	56	106	"I think it would be great to add in a disease element to Civ 5. Imagine dealing with the Black Plague or influenza, damaging standing armies or hindering population growth. Technologies and buildings could lessen the effects of disease, and in the late game spies could unleash anthrax attacks, or a biological bomb could be dropped on enemies. 

This of course would be countered by heavy diplomatic penalties for using bio weapons. 

Additionally we could add a new type of city state: rogue states. States like North Korea or Iran would be highly militaristic and/or religious, and would aid in terrorist attacks through use of their own spies. In late game they may even use nukes or bio weapons. Allying with them would be a diplo penalty, but may assist in performing proxy warfare with other civs or their city-state allies.

1374762544.0	1j11ln	Six More Brave New World Tips	werttrew	240	39	75	"Hello all. Once again, these are tips mostly for people switching from Gods &amp; Kings to Brave New World. My original list of tips is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i68qh/six_brave_new_world_tips/ 



**1. More tips on trade routes**. Trade routes are locked for 30 turns. Not only can trade routes bring in money, if you have a granary in a city it can send food to another one of your cities—or if you have a workshop, it can send production hammers to another city (and note that this does not remove any food or hammers from the sending city). Trade routes to another civ or city state can send religion and science as well. Before you approve a trade route, note the way the arrows are pointing. You can receive a small bump in science—but so could the receiving civ. See this image: http://nowgamer.net-genie.co.uk/siteimage/scale/0/0/361509.jpg The &lt;&lt; direction shows what you can receive—the &gt;&gt; direction shows what they will receive. Religion also flows through trade routes. Sea-based cargo ships will generally earn more money than land-based caravans. Ocean routes get double gold; a city next to a river generates +25 percent trade.

**2. Unhappiness has changed**. In the past, you could go from -1 -&gt; -9 unhappiness without incurring any penalty other than the 1/4 population growth. Now, there is a linear 2% decrease to your production and 2 percent decrease in your military power PER POINT of Unhappiness. So, -3 Unhappiness means a 6 percent less effective military and a 6 percent less productive empire. Also, rebels will appear at -10 unhappiness rather than -20, as in G&amp;K. At -20, cities may rebel and flip to a culturally dominant civ. 

 **3. The bonus Reformation beliefs in the Piety branch can be incredibly strong**. (for a complete list, see here: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Religion_(Civ5) ). Let me mention three in particular. First, with *Heathen Conversion*, barbarian units adjacent to a missionary will automatically join your side. You just have to walk by them—no faith cost. Secondly, with *Jesuit Education*, you may build Universities, Public Schools, and Research Labs with Faith. I recently played a game as Poland where I was able to purchase every single one of these for every single city with faith, and had an awesome science counter. Third, *Sacred Sites* grants all buildings purchased with Faith 2 Tourism each. So if you managed to have both monasteries and cathedrals, for example, they are now generating +2 tourism each! This gives you a sizeable early leg up in a cultural victory. 




**4. Some Wonders have changed**. In G&amp;K, the Terracotta Army generated culture. In BNW, it now gives a copy of each TYPE of unit you currently have. (For example, if your army consists of four composite bowmen, two warriors, two horseman, and a scout, you will receive 1 composite bowmen, 1 warrior, 1 horseman, and 1 scout). Petra no longer gives +1 gold per desert; instead, it generates a bonus caravan and trade route. The Colossus now gives extra money per route, an extra route, and a free ship, but no gold bonus on sea tiles.


**5. Remember that you can buy votes in the World Congress**. If you have a diplomat (rather than a spy) in their capital, you can trade for a  vote on an upcoming issue. Click on a leader, initiate “trade,” and you’ll see the option for World Congress.



**6. Be aware of some new civs’ abilities**. *Why does it seem like those Zulu Impi warriors have extra movement*? It is probably due to the Buffalo Horns unique promotion available to units that train in the Ikanda, the Zulu’s unique building that replaces the barracks. Buffalo Horns grants +1 movement. (see more at http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Ikanda_(Civ5) )

*What kinds of promotions can Indonesia’s Kris Warriors receive*?
These are randomly generated when you first initiate combat: 

INVULNERABILITY+30% Combat Bonus when defending. +20 Hit Points when healing

SNEAK ATTACK Flank attack bonus increased by 50%

HEROISM Unit awards combat bonus to nearby units as if it is a Great General

AMBITION +50% Combat Bonus when attacking. -20% penalty when defending

RESTLESSNESS May Attack Twice. 1 Extra Movement

RECRUITMENT Heals All Damage If Kills Non-Barbarian Unit

ENEMY BLADE Takes 20 Damage If Ends Turn in Enemy Territory

EVIL SPIRITS -10% penalty when attacking. -30% penalty when defending

1358212854.0	16l6tn	I recently played a game of Civ 5  as Japan, where the duplicitous Gandhi declared war on me... I wrote a short story about it.	Jvlivs	250	56	29	"*I apologize in advance if you tl;dr this; after all, it is a short story. Nevertheless, I hope you like it!* 

It is the beginning of a new era in the Japanese Empire. It is the turn of the twentieth century, and the discovery of steam power has ushered in an industrial and cultural revolution. 

My empire is the strongest one in the world, spanning most of the northern half of an asiatic continent.  There has been peace in my land or centuries. My people are happy, my treasuries full, and my culture flourishing. All is well.

To the southwest are the English, with an empire about a third the size of mine. They are generally peaceful, but envious of my empire’s strength and size. They intrude and settle where they please, testing my magnanimity. But I have never started a war, and have no intention on starting one now. 

To the west are the Germans, whose empire is about half the size of mine. They are warlike. Their eternal ruler, Otto von Bismarck, was once a friend… but his greed in conquest caused him to declare war on me some centuries ago. I was too strong for him, and I conquered four of his greatest cities, leaving him to scamper off into the empty lands of the west. 

I do not start wars, but I do end them. 

To the east of my great empire, there used to be a great many nations, but I find them disappearing, one after the other. The Russian Empire and the Aztec Empire have been swallowed up by none other than Gandhi, of India. Now his lands span the entire eastern coast, hugging my borders for half the way. His Empire’s size rivals my own, but I do not worry. Gandhi has never been hostile to me, unlike Bismarck and Elizabeth. We have always had good relations, and in the past he has always been peaceful. If anything, this string of conquests seems unbecoming of him. 

But I suppose the allure of conquest is too much for some. 

I had received a letter from Gandhi, not two weeks after his conquest of Russia. 

	My dear old friend  Nobunaga,

    As you have seen in the past years, my empire has grown to be the
    greatest in the land. I have conquered entire civilizations with my
    armies. It seems that I am destined to rule the world, and I believe 
    you understand what that entails. 

    Signed, 

    Gandhi of India

I didn't quite understand it at first. It seemed too much to be true. but slowly, as I reread it a number of times, it dawned on me. 

And I began shaking, first a small tremor, but slowly it grew. I screamed, furious, tearing the letter to pieces. This was the greatest betrayal of all. Bismarck was friendly, yes, but I never trusted him. I knew the German people were predisposed to aggression and conquest. Elizabeth had always made her feelings known, never hiding in the shadows to seek advantage. But Gandhi, an old friend, whose society was always peaceful, was now at war with me…

I quickly tried to compose myself. No matter, I thought. My empire is vast and unassailable. He has no chance. My armies are greater in number than all except for those of noble Ramesses in Egypt, who was on the other side of the world. 

No matter, I thought, until I received the reports of Gandhi’s armies at the front. Great numbers, immense numbers… One thing I had not taken into account was that Gandhi had been preparing, mobilizing for weeks and setting his soldiers up near my borders, while I had only learned of the impending war mere hours before the attacks began. At the southeastern fringes of my empire, the Indian soldiers marched. They marched across field, forest, and village, taking all for themselves against a courageous but vain resistance by town militias. They came to Sacellum, the great metropolis of the south, a mere week after the declaration of war.

Most of my military installations were in the west, vestiges of a German war and an English threat. Never would I have thought of a threat in the east. In the time it took to get my soldiers to the front, Gandhi pressed on and took Sacellum. This was a grave insult. Never had a city of my own fallen into the hands of an enemy. 

When my soldiers finally arrived at the front, they were cut down. I had greater numbers, and they had some effect, but not enough. My samurais stood no chance against musketmen and riflemen. Courageous and noble as they were, adherents of the Bushido Code, I should have known not to ‘bring a knife to a gunfight’ as it were. In the centuries of peace, I had let my armies grow obsolete, and now I had done naught but send them to their death. At least it was enough to hold the front long enough for a modern army to arrive. 

Yes, a modern army was possible. I already had a few regiments of infantry, soldiers even more effective than the Indian riflemen, equipped with the most state-of-the-art weaponry. I ordered that all the cities of the empire begin training them and for conscriptions begin. 

In the time of the conquest, I had learned that my Empire was vast, perhaps too vast for the good of the war. It was like turning a great ship, too heavy to be nimble. My infrastructure was outdated, and it took a long while to get soldiers to the front. It was not fast enough for them to stack in a significant way and turn the tide. But soon the pace of production quickened, and I was able to get soldiers with the help of my treasuries. 

At the same time, the Indians seemed to be losing their momentum. It looked as if my dear Gandhi had bargained on a blitzkrieg. With this in mind, I look at a map of my empire, and the idea of a speedy conquest is laughable. My soldiers finally began stacking, the infantrymen cutting into Indian lines, pushing back. A year since the beginning of the war, I had retaken Sacellum. 

But I wanted more. I wanted to show Gandhi just how foolish attacking me was. I hated him for being so stupid, childish, petty, for causing so much chaos and death.  I continued to push through, splitting my army into two fronts. One broke through the eastern mountains and turned northward, taking the old Russian lands. The other continued the push south, past Azteca of old and into the heart of the Indian Empire. 

It was now two years since the beginning of the war, and I had the greatest army in the world. I had conquered all of the lands of India. Gandhi had called for peace numerous times, and I had proposed a conditional one in which he would give me many of his resources. A punishment. Predictably, he refused, but why? Was I not clement?  He must know I could annihilate him entirely, the fool! Does he love naught but chaos and death? 

My Empire was too vast already, and could take on no more cities. I decided to implement the Great Southern Plan, which was to liquidate every city if the Indian Empire save Delhi, which I conquered for myself. I did not wish to cause such suffering for the Indian people, but I had to show Gandhi the horrors of war and I had to keep my empire from bloating. It was a lamentable task, but was undoubtedly necessary. Humanity is scarce on the battlefield.

The northern front moved more slowly. They were Russian lands, recently occupied by the Indians, and there were still many soldiers left. However, their doom was inevitable. My numbers were greater, better trained, and better equipped.

 The Great Northern Plan was slightly different than its southern brother. It was less obtuse  in a sense, not merely concerned with annihilation. I had liberated Yekaterinburg, giving the Russians a nation once more. I had taken Moscow and Yakutsk for myself, as they were rich in resources and close to my own empire. I had razed all the other cities, except one. 

There was a city in the far north, at the border of the unending winter, called Khabarovsk. It was once Russian, but had been conquered by the Indians. It was small, miserable, on the edge of habitation and, after the liquidation of Smolensk, the last city of the Indian Empire. Gandhi was there now, sitting in some tower, most likely ruminating sadly about all the horrible mistakes he had made, how his foolishness had cost him his empire, most of his people, and quite soon it would seem, the last scant trace of indian civilization on the planet. My soldiers were but a few miles from the city. The end was a mere three days of fighting away.

And then I called for peace.

No conditions.

But this was my plan, you see. This was in fact the most important part of my plan. 

You must understand that eternal rulers such as Myself, Bismarck, or Gandhi, can only die if their empires have been conquered. We are otherwise immortal, gods among men. But the issue was that I did not want Gandhi to die. I wanted him to live on forever in subservience to me, constantly contemplating his fate, lamenting about how he had once controlled two dozen great cities and a vast empire, and how his hubris had cost him all of it. I wanted him to know, down to his deepest parts, that he was wrong, a fool, an inferior being, and eternally dishonourable.

 I was to keep him alive for as many lifetimes as there were soldiers killed, on both sides. That would be millions of years. Surely, eons would pass, eons in which he would beg for death, yet I would never grant it. And I, in that time, having become a galactic ruler most likely, would continue to visit him every so often and gloat. While I would be out conquering the stars, he would be down on earth, worrying about the next meager harvest. Truly pitiable, truly befitting. 

As time passed, I slowly annexed portions of Gandhi’s land. The land was barely even good enough or vast enough to sustain the city. People were starving even before the annexations. Now, they were truly suffering. He was furious, he screamed I am sure of it, but he could do nothing. Eventually I took all the lands up to within a hundred metres of the city. There was nothing for him to survive on. I played games with him, making him jump through hoops, one time quite literally, in order for him to convince me to give his people an allotment of bread. Was it cruel? Perhaps. But was it justice? Entirely.

I had tried for peace with him, yet he would not listen. I demonstrated my magnanimity, but he would not acknowledge it. I had done all these things, but still he pushed me back. I have now only put him in the place that he has put himself. In the millions of years that will pass between now and the time I finally end his misery, I hope he understands his mistakes.

I do not start wars, but I do end them.

The challenge for this week will involve the Austrian empire's passive - Diplomatic marriage. From the [wiki:](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Special_ability)


&gt;Austrian - Diplomatic Marriage

&gt;Can spend Gold to annex or puppet an allied City-State.*


Using this ability to achieve victory is fine and all, but how will you impress /r/civ? Here are some suggestions:

* OCC, with the exception of diplomatic marriage

* Use diplomatic marriage on every city-state in a maxed out, huge world

* Play as Austria on a high difficulty setting in a duel with Alexander and a lot of city states.

* Be creative, and challenge yourself! I would imagine a close defeat on Emperor would be a lot more popular than an easy win on Settler.


If you are interested in participating, **save this thread**. Then, please post a screenshot (or many) of your victory (or defeat!) to this thread with a detailed description of what your journey was like. I'll list off the most popular campaigns in next week's challenge.

Example. 

Attila's intro: Esĕ halĕ Attila, umĕnche &lt;gibberish&gt;. Avan man kămăllăhn ukkerme irĕk an par. (Writing in Latin here)

You're standing in front of Attila, &lt;gibberish&gt;. Don't ruin my good mood.

The second sentence should have been Avan kămălna. That is evidence that the translator doesn't know Chuvash very well.

Now, why the fuck is there a comma in front of умĕнче?! My name is, Attila? What? Explanation: it says My name is Attila, scourge of Rome in the subtitle. Note the comma. The actor understands English and thinks the Chuvash counterpart is a literal translation of it, so he makes a pause where the comma is in the original English line.

The actor very obviously uses rolling R and other cues that allow me to pin his accent as 100% Russian native. But note his intonation. Kinda lower and with aspiration. This is actually a thing that exists in Chuvash. Basically, ""I-am-better-than-you"" intonation. Either the translator left notes on how to read the entirety of this but not pauses or whatnot, or the actor interacted with some Chuvash rednecks before.

I started on a continent with Poland and we made a quick friendship that lasted throughout the game. 



The Iroquois started on a continent just to the left of mine and we too became friends



Zulu, Assyria, Morroco, Byzantium, and Venice all started on the same contient and pretty much right from the start Zulu and Assyria warred it out. Venice was trying to keep everyone calm while sneakily stealing CS after CS and Morocco was there to make money.

So I've just reached the other continent and meet everyone and I'm confused about why the WC isn't starting up. I forgot the printing press... (I know dumb mistake) So in the time it takes for me to run from metal casting to Printing press, Assyria has become a powerful city hungry maniac. Zulu is cowering in fear, down to his last 3 cities and Byzantium has been entirely wiped out. Soon Assyria made peace with Zulu and left him with his final 2 cities. That's when WC hit me.I heard My friend mention earlier how if it weren't for trade routes his economy would be utterly crippled, so I made the only logical decision and I proposed to embargo Assyria, who had shot up in score. 20 turns later and the vote comes, I've talked everyone into voting on my proposal instead of throwing votes away on Hiawatha's ban on salt.

It may take some time to get used to but I actually prefer it now. It changed my speed on civ greatly.


If you like the graphics in civ, just flick to strategic mode at the end of your turn, it increases the speed between turns by a lot (especially on my computer that does not have dedicated graphics) then flick it back.

Sorry if this is spam or already  common knowledge, I played civ for a while without knowing about strategic mode..

In particular, I'm thinking here of changes from Gods and Kings. 

1. Barbarians' attacks  have been strengthened. They're more aggressive and stronger. 

2. Money is harder (and easier). Oceans and rivers no longer provide extra gold, which means early game (before you start trade routes) can be slow going. Once trade routes ramp up, however, especially the last third of the game money will flow in. Be sure to protect your trade routes against barbarians, however. A cargo ship taken by barbs becomes a barbarian ship. As well, if you anticipate war with someone, divert your trade route beforehand so it doesn't go to them or even through  their lands. 

3. Culture, too, comes slower at first but faster towards the end. 
One of the big reasons for this is that buildings like cathedrals, amphitheaters, and museums now need great works to make them really generate culture. This makes building things like a writers' guild early more important. 

4. Theming bonuses. Any building that houses two or more great works will have a theming bonus--increased tourism benefits for having matching sets of works. Click on the great works on  the top right. Your tooltip will tell you what sets you need for the bonuses.  If you don't have the right type of works, you can swap them from this same screen with other civilizations. 

5. Archaeologists can dig up archaeological sites. Upon completion, two things will happen. First, you may pick up an artifact, which produces culture like an artwork. The cultural origin of this great work depends on its location within or near to a city-state or civilization. It can also be a barbarian artifact. Sometimes you can choose between two national origins.  Secondly, great artists no longer create the landmarks. Instead, they are on option after an archaeologist had completed a dig site. The bonuses can be pretty nice--+1 culture for every era between the landmark's era and your current era. (So, a landmark from the classic era generates +3 in the modern era, and will increase with each era you enter.) You can only pick an artifact over a landmark, however, if you currently have space for a great artwork! Otherwise you'll have to take the landmark. 

6. World Congress can be a game changer. World fairs and international games can be a large boon to you tourism and policies--if you can contribute production to them. Forbidden palace now provides +2 delegates to the world congress, which can be an advantageous early wonder.

I discovered the Indians at about 1200 AD, and they were ""friendly dicks"" for the whole game.  That is, they were flagged as Friendly, but they always performed dickish moves... for example I would spend gold to make an alliance with a city-state, and the very next turn they'd convert it away from me.  Little things like that.

Since I was trying to make as low a profile as possible I kept agreements going with all the major civs... if they asked me for any kind of treaty (open borders, research, etc) I would accept as long as it didn't affect my standing with other civilizations.

In 1786 I got a pop-up message from Gandhi asking to renew our open borders agreement, and I said ""sure, why not"".  Immediately afterward my city converted from my religion to Islam.  Apparently Gandhi managed to get a Great Prophet right next to my city!  So I rolled back to my latest save (1760) and tried to salvage it.

1786 rolled around again and Gandhi asked one more time to renew our open borders.  I said ""NO!""  Gandhi said ""I don't fucking care, Great Prophets aren't affected by Open Borders!"" and my civ once again converted to Islam.

So I rolled back to my latest save again (which was about 1780) and started buying out workers.  By the time Gandhi got to my city I had a couple of workers blocking his path.  So he moved and tried to reposition to another spot around my city... but I managed to keep moving units to block him.  This repeated for 2 or 3 turns.  My only permanent solution was to spawn enough workers and work boats to completely surround my capital.  And for the entire rest of the game Gandhi would move his prophet in a circle around my city, looking for a way to sneak in.

The challenge for this week was submitted to me by /u/ephrin: 

&gt;Information Age

&gt;tilted axis map

&gt;no city states

&gt;no sci victory

&gt;Basically, your spaceship arrives but so do the ships of some other players. The new world has a tilted axis, etc. 

So, pretty much, you have to win by diplomacy or domination in a high-tech world. Or culture, if you're insane (psst, you should totally try culture). Feel free to make the world as strange and inhospitable as you can possibly imagine, just to make things fun!


If you are interested in participating, **save this thread.** Then, please post a screenshot (or many) of your victory (or defeat!) to this thread with a detailed description of what your journey was like. I'll list off the most popular campaigns in next week's challenge.

(I liked the way last week's ran, so we'll stick with what I did)

1365187545.0	1br0eu	What Was the Most Difficult Decision You've Ever Had to Make In-Game?	mcinthedorm	192	29	65	"For me, my most difficult decision was in Civilization 4, where I was forced to abandon my homeland and begin life anew in the new world.

I was playing on a large continent with my immediate neighbors being Egypt to the west and Greece to the south, and the ocean to the east. There was a large island/small continent not too far off the coast, which I was able to settle pretty early on because I was able to island-hop over to it without ever having to cross any ocean squares. I actually think one of the other civilizations had originally spawned there, but had been wiped out very early on by barbarians. 

I was best friends with Greece, but didn't end up getting along very well with Egypt. Around the middle ages I end up deciding to ""deliver some freedom"" to my neighbor Egypt and began some aggressive liberation/democratizing of her cities. The war was brutal, but it was beginning to reach the tipping point and I thought one more assault was all I needed to break Egypt once and for all, so I began to move some of my troops back at home to the front lines for one final assault. 

Long story short, my best friend Greece sensed my vulnerability and betrayed me, and his death-dot of troops swept into my land and began to wreak havoc on my cities. I couldn't stop him, and by the time I was able to withdraw all of my troops from Egypt to back home I began to realize it was too late. 

That was when my decision came. I could try to fight back, but at this point it all seemed futile, and even if I could stop the Greek and Egyptian assaults, it seemed unlikely I could reclaim my lost land, let alone hold them. 

So then I looked at my little continent to the east. I had largely ignored and automated it. It needed a little micromanaging, but it really was some good land with plenty of resources, and I had several good cities there already. So a crazy idea started to form, I began a mass exodus of my troops and workers to the coast, where my fleet would carry all of my people to the New World to abandon their ancient lands and begin life anew. 

While the evacuation took place, several of my troops made the decision to stay behind. They knew death was coming, but stayed behind anyway, fortified in what cities I had left, ready to pay the ultimate sacrifice to buy time so their families and loved ones could escape to safety. 

Of particular note were 6 knights of mine. Greece had no horses of his own, so while he tried to take my lands my knights galloped around his troops, engaging in hit and runs, stealing his workers, and pillaging all of my previous mines, villages, and farms to make sure that whatever land Greece did take from me was useless and barren of all improvements and of no help to him. 

My knights carried on without rest, endlessly pillaging and demoralizing the Greek people. Two of them eventually passed away, but the 4 who survived I nicknamed the 4 Horseman of the Apocalypse, for they had leveled up and eventually been upgraded to the point where they were nearly unstoppable, and their rampage carried on for hundreds and hundreds of years.

But during those years, the people of New America had not forgotten the prices their brothers had payed to ensure their civilization's survival, and they had not forgiven Greece's betrayal. For hundreds of years the people of New America toiled, building their cities, improving the land, and creating an army the size of which had never been seen. And when the time came, an armada of transports landed on the coast to take back their homeland and to forever wipe Greece and Egypt off of the face of the earth. "	t5_2rk3b	True

1354991131.0	14i8tl	Something I thought of for Civilization VI	tnick771	189	29	82	"Something is kinda missing from this game... There's a lot of external competition but none from within. Yes unhappiness and a bad economy can really put a damper on things, and yes sometimes Rebels get going, but I still don't think Civ captures what social change and civil unrest is and how it framed modern society.

So my proposition is there are 15 civs and each Civ has a ""rebel"" faction (e.g. United States/Confederates, Russia/USSR, Germany/East Germany, etc.) That emerges when things get too bad... This is how it would go.

1. Your nation is either (1) too unhappy or (2) has a developed settlement &gt;x tiles away from your capital (i.e. colony)
2. The rebel faction emerges either (1) taking the bottom x% unhappy cities or (2) taking the colony and rebelling.
3. You either (1) recognize their independence or (2) refuse to recognize their independence
4. If you (1) recognized, you will not go to war and cannot for 15 turns, if you (2) refuse to recognize, you immediately go to war and a civil war begins.
5. Other nations may either choose to (1) recognize the country (and even help them), hurting ties with you, or (2) refuse to recognize the rebels and even help you, hurting ties with them. 
6. Eventually you (1) recapture your territories, or (2) cede victory to the rebels giving birth to a new faction.

I have a lot of other ideas too... Like 3 UU's, 1 UB, 1 UW, and 1 UA per faction to add a lot more breadth to the game.

For example, the Confederates would get this.

UU1: Rebel Infantry (+15% fighting within borders, +25% extra bonus from forts, 33% chance of retreat)

UU2: Slave Worker (Maintenance free, must be purchased with gold, if captured by enemy, turns into militia for that faction)

UU3: Southern Calvary (+15% attack against damaged enemy, +15% fighting within borders, +33% chance of retreat)

UB: Southern Docks (Maintenance free, enemy ships that end their turn within 1 tile of the city gets inflicted x damage)

UW: Stone Mountain (+5 Culture, +2 Production, City it is built in rebels for 50% longer and all other cities rebel 25% longer if captured, Cost of Purchasing unites decreased 25%)

UA: Song of the Plantation (+2 gold from Plantations, +1 Culture from Plantations, Units healing on a tile regain health 15% faster)

Etc.

Just adding a little more overall culture to the game... Thoughts?"	t5_2rk3b	True

**Diplomacy:**

The AI constantly bugs you about stuff. It helps to have a good understanding of the *Global Politics* situation from the diplomacy menu. It is worth checking every few turns before agreeing to or rejecting an offer from the AI.

* No one gets open borders from me ever (unless I need to pass through their lands or I they are a permanent ally). AI will use open borders to scout your lands, then start to covet your lands, resulting in a red mark.

* No one gets embassies from me ever. AIs will try to trade embassies almost immediately on contact. If you decline, some city states will eventually give you quests to discover said AI's region. You can buy their embassy from them to easily complete said quest. But there's little reason to give your own embassy away unless you need open borders or are making a good friend. Giving away your embassy is free recon for other AIs, and half the world will never bother looking for your capitol if they never get your embassy. Remember, they can't spy on your capitol until they know where it is.

* If you have a great location for a city near an AI's border, they will covet your lands. This is pretty much the place to mass units as they will generally invade here first and only.

* If an AI requests a resource from you, give it to them. Giving an AI help when they need it is a great diplomacy boost.

* Don't make make Declarations of Friendships with just anyone. Be selective and try to limit your friends. If you see that two AIs are friends with each other, and you can befriend both of them, do it. Making DoFs with the same civs is a big green modifier for both.

* If you make a promise to another civ, to stop spreading religion in their borders, to leave their city states alone or whatever, *do not* break that promise. They'll hate you and denounce you forever.

* Don't directly purchase influence from or pledge to protect a city state who is allied with an AI you want to maintain favor with.

* There's no reason to go to war with an AI if they ask you to. If you want favor, you can always just declare war on their target for a few turns when it looks like the battle is decided to get the ""We made war against a common enemy"" bonus. 

* If you make war on an enemy civ and take one of their cities, be prepared to completely eliminate them or they will denounce you forever.

* Liberating an AI worker from a barbarian is a great way to get favor.

* Keep an eye on the social trees AIs take. If you match Order/Freedom/Autocracy to their favored tree, you'll gain favor.

* If you start next to Caesar or Isabella, you're going to have a bad time. Ignore all of the above.

**Combat:**

* Himeji Castle + Citadels are amazing. Keep your Great Generals until a huge battle at your borders, then pop a cit to expand your territory and damage surrounding enemy units as you culture bomb your way to enemy cities. I recommend maxing Honor tree for any strategy. I've gone through 8+ GGs in a game, don't be stingy with them, use citadels offensively.

* Tech to Crossbowmen while other civs are toying with swordsmen and boats. Ranged is good against everything, you can garrison them effectively, and they upgrade to Gatling/Machine Guns that chew up enemy infantry and cities until you get to artillery/rocket artillery. I don't even bother with catapaults/trebuchets/cannons.

**Culture:**

* I prefer Liberty over Tradition, even though I never build more than 5 cities myself. You'll inevitably need to fight a sprawling enemy civ, so you'll end up with a large empire regardless, even if it is mostly puppet-states. Also, I always keep captured cities as puppets so they don't increase my culture requirements; the G&amp;K puppet build order is much improved over vanilla. The free worker+settler+great person (always scientist)+golden age from Liberty is incredible and amounts to 30+ turn of free production that early in the game.

* Honor is, as stated before, amazing. Free early great general + culture from killing barbarians + 33% reduced upgrade cost (around the time to upgrade to crossbowmen) + culture/happiness from garrisoned crossbowmen + tons of gold from slaughtering masses of AI units is unbeatable.

* I find no use for Piety; if going for cultural victory, you can win even without Piety. I much prefer Rationalism for the +1 science from trading post + jungle cities with universities + Sacred Path pantheon bonus for ridiculous tile bonuses. I'll save the 2 free techs from completing the tree for when the space race is on. I'll also save Oxford University, and post-1920AD great scientists/engineers for the space race. For that matter, Great Library + National University + as many settled great scientists as you can get is preferable to early expansion if you have a little breathing room; I've had capitols  pumping out 400+ science midgame no problem.

* Commerce is map dependent. I'll take it or Patronage as my 5th tree. Patronage if an AI is trying for a culture victory and I need to buy city state allies from them as they complete their 4th tree. But you can generally lock AIs out of a culture victory by taking any two wonders from Oracle, Sistine Chapel, Cristo Redentor, or Sydney Opera House. Commerce is decent, and keep in mind trade routes are net positive income once completed, and you need a capitol with a harbor or a routed city with a harbor to make distant coastal cities with harbors route up.

* Your pick of Freedom/Autocracy/Order doesn't matter much, but I usually go Order for the +25% science/faster build time for factories. Getting to the modern era and picking this up then building factories in every city is a huge boost.

**Religion:**

* I usually go Tithe + Mosques + Pagodas/Religious Community + Sacred Texts. With Printing Press, Sacred Texts means your religion will usually overpower any religions it is competing with. Mosques/Pagodas means more faith to buy scientists/engineers, more happiness, more culture, and no maintenance. If you are the first to found a religion with sacred texts, you can count on the whole continent converting to your religion without even using missionaries, maybe just a great prophet or two (remember to spread your religion to coastal city states asap). When an AI ""Happily converts a majority of their cities to your religion"" it is another big positive for diplomacy.

* Hagia Sophia and Notre Dome are key religious wonders. Picking up your third (or second! or first!) great prophet from Hagia Sophia is huge. The happiness/faith from Notre Dome allows you to put off building temples/colloseums until much later, effectively saving you 10+ gpt as well. 

That's all I can think of right now, though I'm sure I forgot a few good tips.

Edit: Thanks for the great response and the sidebar link. There's some good tips in the comments about selling Embassies/OB/Resources for gold. I have a few more minor points to add:

* If you are trying to make peace with an AI, and they are making ridiculous demands (city, luxuries, all your gold, etc.), go to the Demographics screen and check your **Soldiers** rank. If you can increase your rank by upgrading/producing/purchasing units, the AI should give you a better offer and you will decrease your likelihood of being attacked in the future.

* If you are Pacal, you can get a Great Admiral from your Long Count Bonus even if you don't have a coastal city. It will appear in the ocean and you can use it to explore the world without any sailing techs at all.

* If you can manage, grab Chichen Itza and then complete the Liberty social tree by selecting Representation as the final policy. You'll get a 15 turn Golden Age **and** a Great Person of your choice. If you pick a Great Artist and pop it for another 12 turns of Golden Age, that's **27** turns of bonus gold/hammers/culture and the AI may never catch back up to you.

* If you've only ship-scouted the coast of another continent, you can ally with a coastal city-state there and see what they see to explore further inland without sending in a land unit. Sometimes by doing this, you can discover a natural wonder to complete quests for other city states. "	t5_2rk3b	True

This week's challenge is SUPER SPECIAL, and was submitted a few weeks ago by /u/Teh_Compass. Without further ado, enjoy this week's challenge!

**I Have No Idea What I'm Doing** EDIT: Lols, I had to cut the subreddit heading short because otherwise it cut over the top post.


* The way I interpret this idea is as follows: This is your first game of Civ. You have NO CLUE what is going on, you're just playing because your friend bought it for you and is really excited about it, so you indulge him.

**RULES**

&gt; 1. Beeline for Future Tech. You're not allowed to prioritize any other tech. (Why would you want to? That one is obviously the best.)

&gt; 2. All cities must remain on default focus. You cannot manually assign any citizens or specialists. (Because you don't know how to do that.)

&gt; 3. All workers must be automated. If they are not doing work, have them do nothing, sleep, or delete, depending on your preference. (Who wants to manually tell every worker to put up roads and farms? Nobody. Oh, sweet, an automated function? You should turn that on.)

&gt; 4. As soon as you meet another civilization or city state you must immediately declare war. No exceptions. No other interactions allowed. Never make peace. (Why not? it's not like they're actually going to kill me.)

&gt; 5. Keep all spies in the hideout. You are not allowed to spy on others or defend yourself from spies. (Wait, we have spies?)

&gt; 6. Get social policies from left to right top to bottom. Example: Aristocracy-&gt;Legalism-&gt;Oligarchy-&gt;Landed Elite-&gt;Whatever that last one is with the money and the happiness. Then move on to Liberty, and then Honor, etc. (I just don't get this whole social policy thing.... am I doing it right?) **Optional** *Turn on policy saving and do not purchase policies. This will probably reward you with more precious karma. (So THAT'S what that scribbly noise is!)*

&gt; 7. Do not upgrade your units. (Ugh, every time I research a new tech I have to REBUILD my whole army? This game is dumb.)

&gt; 8. **OPTIONAL** Don't build any wonders. (Uhhh, why would I want to wait TWENTY TURNS to build Stonehenge when I could have another scout like NOW?)

**Settings**

 * All victories on.

 * Any difficulty

 * Any map settings you wish. Come on, let's get creative!


If you are interested in participating, **save this thread**. Then, please post a screenshot (or many) of your victory (or defeat!) to this thread with a detailed description of what your journey was like. 

If you have any ideas for future challenges, feel free to send a PM to me or post them in the thread. If you post one in its own thread, there's approximately a 100% chance that I'll forget it exists by the time I'm choosing a new challenge.

**From last week, the Insanest Montezumas were...**

 * /u/kztsukai did everything right on his Tiny Prince map! I bet he is ready to up the difficulty next time, [too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1gtggz/weekly_challenge_week_19_the_ultimate_sacrifice/canoi1r)

I am a senior at the Illinois Math and Science Academy, a highschool. I have been taking a course called Graph Theory with Applications and we recently came across the topic of random graphs. After viewing this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUisb1-INIE), I noticed that as the probability of edge connections went up and as the evolution of the graph continued, the graph looked strikingly similar to an average game of Civ 5, with the hexagonal connections. The different colored subgraphs are the different civilizations as they grow, and when they combine you get one color (similar to conquering a civilization in the game). The remaining dots that take a long time to connect to something can be seen as the barbarians.

After noticing this I have become much more interested in the theory behind Civilization, and the evolution of the game, the map, and the different outcomes that can occur. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in but if anyone can lead me in the right direction - to papers that have been written, articles, videos, data, etc. it would be greatly appreciated!

1342793438.0	wvgow	Civ V idea: Partisans	donquixote235	181	22	31	"When a civ's last city is taken, rather than disappearing all remaining units are flagged as partisan units (e.g. ""Partisan French Musketeer"", ""Partisan Dutch Worker"").  These units will attempt to retreat to the closest friendly civilization's borders at their normal movement rate.  Upon their arrival, the player will receive a pop-up (""An English frigate seeks asylum.  Do you want to admit them?"")

If the player refuses them asylum, they go on to the next country or if no countries are left for them to go to, they'll wander around until destroyed.

If the player grants them asylum, they become Exiled units (e.g. ""Exiled French Musketeer"", ""Exiled Dutch Worker"").  You have control over them, but they operate at only 2/3 efficiency.  You also take a rep hit with the attacking country because you're harboring fugitives.

However if you manage to take back one of the exiles' cities, you get the option to return the partisans to their rightful civ.  So in addition to the positive rep you get for resurrecting a civilization, you also get a positive rep for giving them back their units.
