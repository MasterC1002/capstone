1355029453.0	14j99w	New Linux Mint user here. I just wanted to say... wow.	Kancho_Ninja	70	6	33	"I've been using Windows 7 since the beta. Heck, I've been using MS operating systems since DOS 3.3

I've dabbled with Linux. Tried Redhat back in the early days, when you would FTP from the Walnut Creek repository.  Over the years, I've tried other flavors, but always went back to Windows because it had a polished interface and drivers that worked with my rigs. Recently, I've watched Ubuntu with great interest - it was seriously trying to create a mainstream, user friendly interface for the Average Joe. 

So this month, I tried Ubuntu 12.04 and was seriously impressed. It took 20 minutes to install on my old Presario CQ62 laptop and once I was done, it recognized everything - ethernet, wireless, printer, sound, graphics... Impressive. Installed Wine and then the only windows program I actually use anymore - Scrivener - and bam. I was completely happy.  Even the Unity Desktop wasn't bad. I was using the dock on the left side of my 21""  monitor in Windows 7, so no big adjustments.

But it was just a bit laggy.

So I did some more reading and decided to try Linux mint. And I'm damn glad I did. No more lag - fast, clean, intuitive, and again, impressive.

I guess I'll be hanging around for awhile :)"	t5_2ro56	True
1365558739.0	1c18bi	A bunch of shit that really fucking pissed me off in Mint 14 and how I fixed it	keto4life	60	3	13	"My Katya install finally gave up on me.

It all went pretty well and it's running extremely fast but there are a couple of things that would annoy or confuse a Mint noob. I encourage you to add any similar ""fixes"" that you think might help out.

##Horrible display Bug with xserver-xorg-video-nouveau
-----


***What happens?***

Using xserver-xorg-video-nouveau and setting the dual monitor setting from mirror to span will cause the menu bar and task menu icons to fuck up horribly, scramble graphically, go all purple and corrupted. 

***How to fix it***

Re-enable mirrored. Go to Software Sources &gt; Additional Drivers &gt; Enable nvidia-current and reboot. Use NVidia X Server tool under preferences to configure dual-display and reboot.

-----
##ALT + middle mouse no longer resizes window
-----

***What happens?***

Alt + left mouse works for moving a window. Alt + middle mouse doesn't resize windows any more.

***How to fix it***

Install and run dconf Editor. Navigate to org &gt; gnome &gt; desktop &gt; wm &gt; preferences. Set ""resize-with-right-button"" to true. You can now use the right button to resize instead of middle. Better than nothing. CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session.

-----
##Key bindings refuse to stick to Super + ""x"" shortcuts
-----

***What happens?***

You use the keyboard manager to set shortcuts. It does fuck all and just ignores your settings, sometimes bringing up the quick-fix text dialogue in whatever window you're in where it just types the shortcut letter. Setting Home folder to ***&lt;Super&gt; + E*** for example will just type an ""e"" in the window you're focussed on instead of observing the shotcut.

***How to fix it***

Install and run dconf Editor. Navigate to org &gt; cinnamon &gt; muffin &gt; keybindings. Set ""overlay-key"" to nothing (an empty string). CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session.

-----
##Ubuntu One not installed by default/won't load
-----

***What happens?***

Installing ubuntu one from the software center / synaptic does nothing.

***How to fix it***

For Nadia, run:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntuone/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ubuntuone-client ubuntuone-control-panel ubuntuone-client-proxy ubuntuone-control-panel-qt

CTRL + ALT + Backspace to restart the session. Run ""Ubuntu One"" from the preferences menu to set up the sync.

-----
##Installing a LAMP stack doesn't actually install PHP
-----

***What happens?***

You use tasksel to install a LAMP stack. PHP is missing for no good reason other than to piss you off because it's 3am and you're tired as shit from all the overtime you've put in because some ass-hat at work keeps requesting undeliverable deliverables as you're leaving the office.

***How to fix it***

The whole LAMP stack is as follows:

    sudo apt-get install tasksel
    sudo tasksel

Select ""LAMP"" and next-next-next etc with passwords where necessary. Run this to install the missing bits and some other useful extras.

    sudo apt-get install php5 php5-gd php5-imagick php5-curl
    sudo service apache2 restart

1321239384.0	mbde1	My view of Mint 12		33	7	22	"I gave Linux Mint 12 a spin in Virtualbox today and here are my thoughts.  Keep in mind that this is a first impression.

To start out, I left Ubuntu because of Unity.  Both Gnome 3 and Unity--in my view--are useless as a PC desktop.  Perhaps less so as a touch interface, but they still leave lots to be desired.  Both seem to remove functionality and make the desktop harder to use.  If they expect me to re-learn how to use the desktop, they better provide some serious benefit.  As I see it, neither does.

That said, Mint 12 is a more cohesive approach to the whole Unity/Gnome 3 approach but still only resolves about 60% or less of my concerns.  It is as I understand it so far, unusable as my desktop unless MATE is more functional.

Gnome 3 is light-years ahead of Unity in just about every way IMHO, but they appear to be approaching the desktop from different perspectives.  I think the focus of Unity is as a touch interface.  Gnome 3's focus escapes me.  Perhaps it's just to be obscure.

It isn't all bad though.  Gnome 3 is far more impressive from a visual standpoint.  But placing form before function is a path to obscurity.  Not that there isn't functionality buried beneath all that nice form, I just have no idea how to make use of it.  Now what exactly am I to make of a user interface if I don't know how to use it.  Still, Mint 12 makes it far and away a more usable interface.  But I detest the Mint Menu because it reflects in Gnome the reasons I didn't like KDE.  It is an unorganized mess and if you don't know the name of an application or what its called in Gnome speak, your SOL.  Here's an idea, what say we organize everything between three main menus that describe the basic functionality found within.  Something like Applications, Places and System should do it.  and If I detest the Mint Menu, what do  you suppose I make of the Gnome 3 menu?

I did like the fact that I get previews of open windows in the Gnome menu.  I would never think to look there for the previews, but the functionality is about the only nice thing I have to say about dumping everything into one menu.  

I certainly don't like the inability to add things to the top panel.  I like and depend on the functionality of CheckGMail.  If there was no reason to use Linux but CheckGMail, I'd use Linux.  If I cannot have it I'll go looking for another distro.  And before you go trippin about the indicator applet, it is of no use to me.

The functionality(?) behind the workspace switcher seems odd to me.  Somebody has decided that it would be nice if only one workspace was viewable until you load an application.  That somebody is wrong.  Not that it matters all that much since I couldn't click on the workspace icon and get to the workspace anyway.

Now that I feel like a curmudgeon, let me be nice for a little bit.  Mint 12 has a well healed feel for a release candidate. MATE had a bit of a problem when I tried to do some things with it but based on the release notes I had little hope that MATE would be all that ready.  I do want to revisit MATE when I get some time.  Without MGSE, I think Gnome 3 would be mostly unusable. I didn't spend a whole lot of time playing around with the extensions, that will come later.  That said, MGSE in its current form only makes Gnome 3 somewhat usable.  Sometimes when something is careening toward obscurity, you should just let it go."	t5_2ro56	True

Is it fairly safe to assume we won't see Unity - or a Linux Mint version of it - or is it a real possibility? I've just got used to the awesomeness of Linux Mint which is MUCH faster than Ubuntu on my ageing Dell Inspiron 1525 and I really don't want to have to look elsewhere.

I feel like Ubuntu has forced our hand with Unity. The Ubuntu classic desktop is all good and well but we were told the 11.10 release doesn't have it and you have to use unity. I don't see that as being very friendly - more a regime and I don't want the same to happen with my newly discovered Linux Mint.

Mint 15's default (buggy) kernel fails to boot/shutdown 50% of the time...	d_r_benway	31	10	28	"Mint have a really stupid policy of not upgrading the kernel as part of the standard OS updates.

This is bad for 2 main reasons for the average user (who may not be aware of this)

1. Security : It means your running a kernel with known (and fixed)  vulnerabilities - i.e root exploit - CVE-2013-2094

2. Stability : The kernel shipped with ubuntu 13.04 (3.8.0-19-generic) (which mint is based on) has severe issues (at least with nvidia h/w)  - at the start my desktop refused to boot or shutdown correctly 50% of the time - this occured on multiple machines including my work one -

this has been fixed in the ubuntu/kubuntu kernel (3.8.0-22-generic) . however will not be for mint users (as mint doesn't update the kernel unless you explicitly tell it too..)

There are 2 ways of ensuring you have the latest ubuntu kernel

1. use 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' on the command line (reboot afterwards)

2. See the post here to activate level4/level5

If you're not interested in a guy going on and on about how awesome Linux Mint is, go ahead and close this tab. If you're looking for a good distribution or enjoy LM like myself, go ahead and continue reading.

Linux Mint is truly the light at the end of the tunnel for Linux users. I've been using Windows for quite some time, and it's instability and unreliability frustrated me. I was interested in Linux at the time, so I just decided to replace Windows with Linux. My first distribution was Fedora. I was raised using Fedora, and it's been used in my family for quite some time. The latest version at the time was Fedora 14. I was impressed with the suite of applications and the GNOME interface, but my computer didn't seem to like it. It would often crash, and it appeared there was no media codecs preinstalled in Fedora. Being an avid music listener, this was a huge problem for me, so I had to look for a new distribution.

My second try was Ubuntu. I was instantly dissatisfied with the Unity interface. It was slow and clunky and stupid. It was almost as unstable as Windows.

After a few more distributions, I discovered Linux Mint. I was highly impressed by the screenshots- the interface looked fantastic. I gave it a go, and I installed it to my system almost instantly. I absolutely loved the interface, the rock solid stability, and the Software Center. 

The Software Center is one of the biggest things I love about LM. It's easy to use and get around. Almost every app that is available for Linux is available on the LM Software Center.

It was a bit wonky, but at least I could do a few things while waiting for said hard drive.

Now that I've got the hard drive, I've decided to stick with Linux and see just if it's any better than Windows 7. So far it's nice and fast, but I'm having a *hard* time figuring out how to use it.

For example, I'm a fan of Google Chrome, so I just tried to download it. I'm stuck on a ""Package Installer"" screen which doesn't seem to be doing anything from what I can tell. Not only that, but I don't even know where my files are extracting to. A search through the applications menu reveals no results of Google Chrome ever being installed. When I researched online a small tutorial mentioned that files don't download or install the same way as Windows and it seems there's some kind of command function I have to go through in order to do so, but it doesn't explain how to go about this.

Maybe I'm just horribly illiterate when it comes to a different OS, but I like the way Linux is operating and I don't want to give up on it just because I'm too dumb to figure it out.

But, as I turned 40, I decided that I would give Ubuntu a try.  It was nice, and I soon wallowed blissfully like the metaphorical pig in shit.

I've really tried to like unity.  I Probably gave it a much stronger try than the average old guy.  But, it's just too slow.  It makes my netbook verge on unuseable, i.e. constantly dimming while it's working hard.

Yesterday I picked up a lease return machine from the windows vista era.  By all accounts a pretty dismal machine, but it's cheap, doesn't use much power, and will be perfect for light browsing and streaming audio in a new studio I'm building.  

I decided to give Mint a go.  I have to say that I haven't felt compelled to donate since Pat V. got sick.  Mint is truly fantastic.  If you have some spare cash, please, from an old guy, donate.  It's well deserved, and I need it to stick around :)

Then there was knoppix it was great to use it at internet cafe cause no one could follow what i do. (yes yes those stuff.) i then tried Debian without success and i lost my computer while trying. (i had changed file systems and i couldn't reinstall Win98.) a few months later i finally managed to install Debian after i figured out i needed an ethernet cable and internet access. wow gnome was great.  my computer was finally running fast but i had lost wi-fi. 

i then heard that a company from africa (yes i now know its from South Africa but at that time it was just Africa.) was sending free cds. and i opt-in. that is how Ubuntu time started for me. i guess it was 2004 or 2005. i received the cds. (10 cds :S i don't know why i wanted that much.) booted with it and then standard installing. 

that was even greater. 

years passed i have tried several distros, Fedora, Suse, Pardus, OpenSuse, PcLinuxOs, YellowDogSomething,Slackware, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Gelecek, Linux Mint and several DE's; Gnome, XFCE, LXDE, KDE, E16,E17, *box things, Gnome-Shell, Unity, Mate, Cinnamon. 

i settled with Linux Mint and Cinnamon/mate. i still try different distros even now i have got Elementary and Linux Mint 15 Cinnamon installed side by side. I chose Linux Mint as daily driver cause i like it. But i can't say why i don't use MS Windows (even i have a legit licence which came with my computer.) except it is closed source. 

I only use my computer to browse, multimedia (as a viewer), office things, e-book reading. so i really don't need any thing special as an os. i really wonder why i chose GNU/Linux. 

maybe you may help me understand my choosing with telling why you have chosen what you have chosen.

I've tried, I really have, and I would stay with it but it's killing my 4 year old system. Every thing I do comes with a serious system lag. 

So. To the questions!

* I like the idea of Unity, but the system overhead is appalling. Docky &amp; Gnome-Do did much the same thing except quicker in 10.12. I just want a fast launcher, I can live without lenses &amp; half-arsed global menus. Can I go back to Docky on Mint?

* Last time I installed 12.04 ,my own and another machine, the standard installer failed repeatedly (hanging). MD5 etc were all ok. The eventual fix was to use an alternate installer. Is there an alternate installer for Mint? I couldn't see one.

* If there isn't an alternate, what would I do in case in Installation barf? Ubuntu Forums &amp; Ask Ubuntu couldn't help the last time. Despite 5 years on Ubuntu, I am not a linux power user.

* Can I keep my UbuntuOne account? 

* Can anyone give me a feeling for 13's ""zippiness""? Will I get some speed back? It's a 4 old Latitude laptop, dual core 2.25GHz with 8 GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics but in good condition. It was fine until 12.04.

* I'm about to burn a live DVD and take it for a spin. That and your answers will help me make the decision.

Many years ago, when their 233 MHz Compaq died, I set them up with a PIII/500 with Ubuntu 6.x or so and they were happy with that for a couple years. They bought a cheap new PC when they had some money. It is this PC which is now ""slow"" under Windows. (Vista, I think.) Can anyone give me a quick overview of the differences between Mate, Cinnamon, KDE, and XFCE?

These are basic users who are happy with a traditional XP-style desktop. (They also tend to load it up with weather widgets and crap like that, which is what makes it slow -- like 2 minutes from ""I entered my password"" to ""the browser has finished launching"" and they don't want to uninstall that... but they're happy to buy a new computer to ""fix"" things, or try a new OS. Yeah... That's why I gave them Ubuntu last time -- so they couldn't muck it up.) I don't think they'd like what Ubuntu has turned into which is why I'm looking at Mint, which only had 1 option last time I looked at it. I don't really want to download and check out all 4 myself. 

As long as facebook games and youtube work, I think they'll be OK. They'd probably be fine with anything. I will let them try it as a Live CD for a while and if it's OK I will be handling the installation. I know they just wouldn't have the patience (or care enough) to try all four.

As the title says,  I just installed Linux Mint 13 XFCE on an old laptop... I did so with the understanding that I needed to use something light and stable. To justify, here are the following specs:

* RAM - 2gs
* Processor - 1.6 GHz ( single core i believe, MIGHT be dual)
* Integrated generic vid card - I honestly dont remember what the GPU or mem was on it, will need to check when I get home. 
* HD - 200g

I should also preface that this is my first linux install on a personal PC, I used to be a server admin for several linux servers utilized in a middle teir environment. Grant it wasnt very good but I have a decent understanding of linux command line, but none in the GUI or personal use. 

Moving on, I have seen several posters talking about how they are using Mint 14 cinnamon, where i was understanding that was a bit heavier and would run well without a decent machine. I dont have much on the computer it was more for tinkering and playing, so i dont mind breaking it.

2. I am also a torrenter(who isnt? :)) but no matter what kind of client I use (deluge, transmission) I can download but not upload. Yet on my Windows partition(I know I'm a traitor, but I'm not fully ready to commit to the distro because I don't fully understand it) I can download and upload just fine while using utorrent.

Obviously these are not the latest ones and I'm kind of certain that the latest and official ones perform better than the one I currently use.

Currently using Linux Min 14 64-bit with Cinnamon. 

CPU: Athlon X2 6000+  
GPU: GeForce 8800 GTS  
RAM: 4GB (2x2GB) 800MHz DDR2  
MB: Gigabyte GA-MA69VM-S2

So my question is, how do I manually install the latest NVIDIA drivers? Which would be **310.32** as of this moment.

Also, would I need to remove the existing ones and if so, how would you do then? 

Any tips or tricks would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance,  
Cyphe

---

EDIT: So here's the step by step solution I used to install the latest NVIDIA drivers.

---

Open the terminal (or press Ctrl+Alt+T to open it).

Add the following PPA:

* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa

Then we type:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade

After that we install the actual driver:

* sudo apt-get install nvidia-310

And we remove the old one:

* sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current

Foolishly tried Arch Llinux but my internet connection is not that reliable even if I get good bandwidth (3G tethering over the phone). I needed a stable distro and I remembered Linux Mint.

After I installed it I went to set up my video card, it was working in Ubuntu so didn't think I'd have much problems with it. I open up the terminal to install the proprietary drivers and I get this problem. So I ask on the linuxmint-help and they point me to this [tutorial](http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Quantal_Installation_Guide). So I purge my installation and follow that, reinstalled via repos same result, purge again, build from source, same result. So now I'm at a loss of what else to do.

I've gone and fucked up Cinnamon a bit and was wondering if any of you could give me some guidance on fixing it - I've tried a few measures myself but haven't had any luck and **really** don't want to do a fresh reinstall.

So here's what happened. There's a lovely Cinnamon theme called Holo which I liked, but it had a few features that bothered me. So I opened the theme's CSS and made some changes. Nothing major, just checked for colours I didn't like and changed their hex values to colours I did like.

Restart to apply changes. Suddenly Cinnamon won't start at all. Window manager (Mint-X themed window title bar) won't work at all, Cinnamon panel won't show up, nothing. I log out and log into Gnome and attempt to re-construct the Cinnamon CSS with a backup I have saved somewhere else. Doesn't work.

Other attempts include:

1. Installing MATE. Terminal says it's installed, but it won't show up as a login option. I don't really want MATE, but if I can't fix Cinnamon I can get it to do the job.

2. Removed Cinnamon via terminal, purged, and attempted to re-install. Tells me I have broken packages. Try to install via package manager because 'hell, why not', same issue.

Any ideas on how to fix this? I'm not doing badly with Gnome for now... but I really want my nice UI back. :("	t5_2ro56	True

It was that good.

I'm testing out Mint and I like the interface WAY more than Ubuntu. It's aesthetically pleasing and very organized. But I hate how Mint doesn't have useful tutorials like the Ubuntu website. The official Mint documentation file wasn't at all helpful for my questions, and I absolutely hate sifting through forum posts when I urgently need information. Upon installation, I had an issue with the wifi drivers (and later on other things), and I can't recall the amount of time I spent going through tons of posts and topics on the Mint forum trying to figure out the solution.

There may have been more efficient ways of finding information for my Mint issues, but I know that I wouldn't have had the same problem if I was still using Ubuntu. For me, its a trade off.

This is a single mom who just wants a computer that her kids can use facebook and browse the internet with.

For a variety of reasons I've chosen Mint 11 (vs Ubuntu and vs 12) though I'm running the RC myself and am happy with it.

It's actually a decent system --  2+ GHz (don't remember exactly) P4, 1.5GB RAM, 6600GT graphics.

Now, when I first build a system there are a few things I do right away -- but I've realized since moving to Mint myself that Clem and Co. have already done most of those things.

What are the things I will forget to set up or install which would be trivial for a Linux user to do themselves later, but which I'm going to want to make sure I do for them before I set it up for them?  For example, I think I better find a firefox-current stable PPA so that firefox will keep updating.

Can anyone think of anything else that I'm likely to smack myself for later when I realize I didn't do it ahead of time for them?

This is a good enough friend of my wife's that I'm happy to give them this computer and happy to do support for them afterwards -- but not someone we're close enough with that we'll be seeing them often.  So I'd like it to be as buttoned up and ready to go as possible when we go to set it up...

I started off by tweaking my processor profiles to ""performance"", this keeps the clocks high and is probably bad for power consumption but is immediately noticeable for literally everything. (Not recommended for laptops.)

I have a 6 core processor but the procedure is the same for any amount of cores but has to be repeated per core.  First you have to disable ondemand so that the preferences don't reset on reboot.  This is easily reversible and you can put everything back by doing an 'enable'

    sudo update-rc.d ondemand disable

From there you have to manually edit the contents of the core profile.  I prefer to do this from the command line.  This will depend on how many processors you have and will need to be repeated for each core.  First check what you have now.

    cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

It should say ondemand.

    cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
    ls

This will show you how many cores you have and need to be changed.

    echo /cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governer &gt; performance

repeat this command replacing the first directory with subsequent cpu's

**If you don't run an Nvidia card  STOP HERE, I can't guarantee compatibility with other cards.  I had to patch this Nvidia driver to work with the kernel and fought with it a bit so unless you know you have drivers compatible with the 3.10 kernel don't bother!**

Next we want a faster kernel.  3.8.27 isn't too bad but it's not the new hotness nor is it custom hotness.  We want the 3.10-pf kernel.  Easy peasy.  More info here.  http://pf.natalenko.name/

First we need to add a repository.  Click your update manager icon and in the menu select software sources.  Then select add repository.  Add this line.

    deb http://repos.natalenko.name/ubuntu/ pf/

Now refresh your source lists, and open synaptic package manager.  You are looking for linux-image-3.10-pf  and linux-headers-3.10.pf  Install them.  Now comes the fun part... not really.

You can either patch the nvidia driver yourself based on the instructions from the Slackware forums, or you can use the one that I patched using [said instructions.  That start here.](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/kernel-3-10-x86_64-and-nvidia-319-32-driver-4175467995/).  I'll save you the trouble and you can dl the driver from mega.

https://mega.co.nz/#!x4IzkAqD!eTpCxU4bPcGKRLsNuthtJmISlGd6XH-18n6C8p-gjf4

This is the 64 bit version... if you are not using the x64 bit version of Mint, uninstall your distro and use the 64 bit version lol.  2013 you should all be using x64.

Now that you have the driver.  Right click on it and make sure it's executable.  Also make sure that you are currently using an Nvidia driver **and not noveau**.  I screwed up and tried to install this over noveau... it was a royal pain in the ass.  If you start with one of the distro Nvidia drivers it will save you A LOT OF HASSLE.

Drop to a shell... you might want to write this down unless you are familiar with the process.

    ctrl + alt + F1
    login
    navigate to the directory you downloaded the driver to.

    sudo service mdm stop  (mdm is used in kde but use the window manager appropriate for your version)
    ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.32.patched.run

Follow the prompts.  I'd suggest not installing dkms to avoid potential issues but it's your discression.

Once it is complete.  Reboot.  **Congratulations, you know have a system that will rival Arch in speed!!!**

[edit] - I benched this against my Manjaro KDE install and it was quite close.  The winner being Mint!! (although not for raw speed but for the lack of wacky bugs like dolphin making /media folders for Truecrypt volumes and not being able to install MySQL Workbench etc. They are so close upon modification that the only two noticible differences are that Manjaro boots slightly faster (and has an uglier login screen) and that Manjaro's dolphin is a lot faster (I will figure out what they did to it and bring it home to the good guys :)  As a side note, if you love mint then you will probably also love Manjaro - they are a bit rough around the edges like most Arch systems, but most Mint users would find Manjaro to be like a cousin to Mint.


When I get my short as hell break (Working as a sysadmin and in college... I'll try to figure out why dolphin is so slow in Mint.  It has to be some buggy additions, but I haven't had the time to break it down.  [Why don't you ask the active dev?  Because they are always colorblind to their own creations.  The Manjaro folks have terrible tastes in design but they have dolphin so fast it makes nautilus look like a dog.  I'd like to be able to fix that.  A responsive and quick file manager makes the overall experience seem so much better.) - S

1. I saw that Mint's Update manager labels the risk of updates on a scale from 1 to 5, where defaults are 1-3. In your experience, how much instability do packages from class 4 and 5 introduce?

2. Mint discourages dist-upgrading, but rather reinstalling the whole system. Since I'm planning to stick with LTS, reinstalling once every two years doesn't sound terrible. However, I'd like to know your experience with dist-upgrading. Does it fail often? Does it cause some failure that's difficult to solve?

1372871616.0	1hktc5	What should I know when upgrading from Ubuntu?	Reliant	7	0	14	"I started with Debian in 2001 and switch to Ubuntu around 2006. I haven't been happy with the direction Ubuntu is going, and a few months ago I switched my GUI to the one Mint uses, and I'm happy with it. I don't consider myself a ""power user"". I'm an end user. I use it primarily for work. My choice in Linux OS is based around an OS that just works as easily as possible.

I'm currently running a dual boot system on a 500Gb Hybrid. 400Gb for Windows 7, and 100 Gb for Ubuntu. I have just ordered a 500Gb SSD to replace it, and it's going to have a similar 400-100 partition for dual booting.

I only plan on having the hybrid available temporarily to copy off my files before it gets re-purposed for something else.

My plan is to begin by installing Windows 7 on the 400Gb partition, and then installing Linux on the 100Gb partition so that grub can take over as the boot partition.

Are there things I should know that will make this upgrade easier? Things I should do to make any future upgrades easier? What do I do once my new install is done; there's nothing on the sidebar for a Getting Started. My new drive will probably arrive next week, so I have time to prepare.

Edit: My new drive arrived early. I have installed Mint, but it did not go very well. Kdevelop, the primary application I use, doesn't work in cinnamon. I've posted on the Mint forums, but if I can't find a solution, I'll be left having to go back to Ubunutu."	t5_2ro56	True
1371749748.0	1gqme3	Please explain to me like I am five years old.	soldieringon	11	5	17	"**SOLVED!!!**

I am a brand new user who cannot get Linux to install properly. I am very frustrated, and need a working OS as fast as possible.

My windows crashed, and the hard disk had to be formatted. The reasons are inconsequential, but the result is an unallocated 750GB hard disk.

Using my wife's laptop, I downloaded the iso for Linux Mint and created a bootable flash drive with UnetBootin. I entered my laptop's BIOS and set the flash drive to be first boot.

These are the steps I have taken:

I am now in Linux through the flash drive and have a completely empty, unallocated hard drive.

I click on install, and answer the language prompts

I have the available space, and am connected to the internet.

I select ""Erase Disk and install Linux Mint""

Select my city for Los Angeles (I'm not,but it's close enough)

I select my keyboard layout

Enter my username and password

And linux installs.

I choose to reboot, and remove the installation media (thumb drive) once the computer powers down, and before it powers back up.

Upon reboot, however, I am given an error that says ""PXE-E61 media not recognized""

I understand that this means it wants to boot from the network card, and that it’s not recognizing the hard disk for some reason.

I then restart the computer with the bootable flash drive installed, and open up GParted. In Gparted, I get the following information:

/dev/sda1 fat32 1.5MiB used out of 94MiB, and a boot flag

/dev/sda2 ext4 14.35GiB used out of 678.28GiB and no flags

/dev/sda3 linux-swap 5.92GiB used, and no flags. Also there is a picture next to it that looks like a telephone

I can access my drive and see the files, I just can’t get it to boot.

When I go into Disks from the menu, sda1 and sda2 are not mounted. I don’t know what that really means, since I can see the whole drive under the documents menu.

What do I do? I have tried to be as specific as possible, and I have looked through forums for two days now, and I can’t seem to get this to work. So much of this is going right over my head.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1366380665.0	1codsc	UEFI Dual-boot Windows 8 and Mint 14 - how I managed to do it - (Acer XC100)	shortbaldman	8	1	15	"It seems it's better installing Mint dual-boot on a newer UEFI Windows 8 machine by ensuring that the Mint 14 install medium boots ONLY in EFI mode. I couldn't do that using a DVD drive, as it seemed to me that it always insisted on booting in the old BIOS. Anyhow, use unetbootin to make a fresh USB key with the contents of the Mint 14.1 DVD iso-image. There must be an EFI subdirectory.


Start to boot up Windows8, but hit the DEL key when the Acer logo shows and a beep is heard (if you're not using an Acer, check what key is needed for your brand of computer) to reach the BIOS configuration screen.  Go to the Authentication screen, and turn off Secure-Boot.  Then proceed to the Boot-Options screen and turn on CSM temporarily so that we can boot using the normal MBR type of boot-system.  On the same screen (on Acer) check the order of boot devices, we want to give USB keys and/or CD/DVD devices priority over the hard drive. Also ensure that the boot-menu is enabled, otherwise you won't be able to select the USB key to boot from and therefore you won't be able to boot into anything else but Windows.  Save and exit.


When you've opened Windows, shrink the C: drive by opening Control-Panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Storage -&gt; Disk Management. Right-click on the C: drive and select Shrink Volume. Adjust the shrinkage to suit yourself. If you have a D: drive, then shrink that at the same time if you want.


[Handy Hint: Because of the way the original hard-drives are produced and supplied in your OEM machine, it is usually very hard to shrink the C: drive very much using the Control Panel method on your OEM untouched hard-drive. But when you use the complete recovery method from your Windows Recovery Disks which you made after you began using your Windows machine, files are not scattered all over the partition, but are all compacted better and you will usually be able to condense the C: partition very easily.  So delete your C: partition (if you're brave enough &lt;grin&gt;) and use your Windows Recovery Disks to get back to a Factory-Defaults install of the machine. If you're even braver, you can adjust the Recovery Disk files to partition the Windows partitions to your desired sizes on recovery.]


At this point I use Gparted Live CD and an external USB hard-drive to back-up all those Windows partitions as belt-and-braces. You should already have made your Windows Recovery System disks anyway. These were my original hard-drive partitions, notice that on a GPT partition system *all* partitions are *primary* partitions.


original clean Windows 8:

      Partition Table: gpt
      
      Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                                 Flags
      1      1049kB  420MB   419MB   ntfs         Basic data partition           hidden, diag
      2      420MB   735MB   315MB   fat32        EFI system partition           boot

      6      985GB   1000GB  15.6GB  ntfs         Basic data partition           hidden, diag


I then set up my hard-drive so that I like it:
      
      Partition Table: gpt

     11      149GB   1000GB  851GB   ext4

Fast Summary: 

Shrink C: partition to your taste. I cut mine back all the way to just 50Gig.  I kept a very small D: partition just as a place-keeper to keep all the Windows partitions in the same relative positions.  I sometimes move /dev/sda6, but I feel it's easier and simpler to just delete the original D: (/dev/sda5) and 'One Touch Reset' (/dev/sda6) partitions and make new ones, restoring the contents of the 'One Touch Reset' partition from the backups.  Then make all your Linux partitions: *two* root partitions in case I want to experiment with another distro, swap of course, a separate /home so I can just carry over everything to a new distro if required (not too big a /home directory, it's just for day-to-day work), then a large separate storage partition for long-term files/archives.


Then proceed to the Boot-Options screen and turn CSM off again so that we can't boot using the normal MBR type of boot-system. On the same screen (on Acer) confirm that the boot-menu is enabled, otherwise you won't be able to boot into anything else but Windows. 


Save and exit. The machine will now reboot using EFI *only* and restricts you to only booting up Windows and other EFI systems.


At the Acer logo and beep, hit the F12 key, a boot-menu will display. Move the bar to the entry for the USB key with Mint 14 and which is marked 'UEFI' and select.


Install normally. When you get to the 'Installation Type' page, select 'something else'. Use the 'Change' button to select your intended partitions as the root, /home and other mount points for your filesystems. Be careful not to touch any of the Windows 8 partitions. Leave the 'sda' entry as the position for the grub boot device. Then click on 'Install Now'


With my install, grub would install to the UEFI boot, but would find only Mint, so I was unable to boot Windows. Fixing the boot-up is the purpose of 'boot-repair'. So I downloaded the boot-repair package(s) with these commands:


       # sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update
       # sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair &amp;&amp; boot-repair


boot-repair will scan for a while. Accept the 'Recommended Repair'.

And that's it. Now you have a dual-boot Windows 8 and Mint 14.1 system

First, thanks to you non-gender specific guys' responses when I was considering changing, you convinced me. 

Cinnamon looked lovely but after the second boot all I had a blank desktop, no way of interacting with the system, so I installed MATE. It's like how Ubuntu used to be, and it's my system again without lag killing everything.

I have a few issues though, and got no response on the LM forums so it's some trepidation I try here.

* ~~I use an external display on the left hand side of the laptop. The task bar is on the laptop. I want the external dispaly as the primary with the taskbar. I've installed Jupiter as suggested, but the only way I can get the display on the left is to reverse the position of the monitors. When this happens I have to move the mouse cursor off the left hand side of the left hand monitor to get to the right hand display. That's unusable so I currently have the taskbar on the RHS laptop display. Any other ideas?~~ 

* On any reset, the laptop screen never keeps the correct resolution, always starting on 1024, instead of 1280. Not a big deal, but annoying.

* Desktop icons. This has been an annoyance for 4 years at least. I'd prefer a list view, like in Nautilus. Icons with text on RHS, small size. That way I could have my few icons nicely arranged. I could do this on Windows 10 years ago. This doesn't seem easily possible on Ubuntu. I found a script that could do it on 9.10, 3 years ago, now gone since I changed over.

* ~~I changed to the Radiance theme. As soon as I did the window control buttons swapped to the left. If I try to fix it in gconf-editor, it already specifies right. If I change themes , there's no effect. Aaargh!~~

I have the latest apache, php, mysql and postgre sql installed and running. My dns points to the right IP (the guest is in bridged adapter mode and has a static address). A multisite drupal install on top of that. This was working fine, just how I wanted it.

Problem is, when I install the guest additions on mint, the web server no longer accepts wan side web server requests. Local requests from either the guest, the host or another machine on that subnet all work fine. No issues, but as soon as I punch in the domain name or Ip of the router this is all sitting behind (with a nat entry pointing tothe guests ip), it just times out. 

Even without drupal installed and running this issue occurs. It's just odd that it only begins to happen after I run guest additions (I really only putty in to the guest, but wanted a fullscreen option if I want to use the desktop of it).

So I suppose this is really a virtualbox quetion/problem, but I figure it couldnt hurt to run in by you guys first. See if you have any suggestions on what I can look at.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!

1328171420.0	p7hcz	Going from Archlinux to Mint, how userUNfriendly is mint?	lvomrm	9	1	18	"Hi

I'm thinking about changing my linux systems to LinuxMint. Currently I am using ArchLinux, before that I tried almost everything, but mainly I was using Ubuntu.

If you don't have the patience skip to the end of my post. If you want to know my Linux backround for a well-informed answer please read on :)

Now, what I really hated about Ubuntu was that it tried to hide so much from the user. While I regard it to be a feature that Linux-Novices are being helped with all the user friendly features, I hated that you can't easily force Ubuntu to tell you as much as possible. Maybe I was not advanced at that time to configure it right, but in my experience it was hard to find out WHY something didn't work.

But now I worked with Archlinux (for the ones who don't know Arch, it's a VERY lightweight and ""pure"" Linux, when you first install it you only have a Terminal and have to get GNOME or another Windowmanager yourself... after setting up the internetconection only usig commandlinetools). I consider myself an advanced Linux user and want to use everything Linux has to offer, I don't want to be restricted by the Distribution. And I love using the terminal as much as possible, I want to be able to still use many commandlinetools, I don't want some Frontend-GUI to force me to use it. So I want a Distribution with a nice package, but I want to be able to tweak that package the way I want! (Pun partly intended).

Long Story short: Is LinuxMint as quiet as Ubuntu? Can you tweak everything you like from your terminal? Is it fast... (...enough for a Intel-Atom-Netbook)?"	t5_2ro56	True

So, I've moved on to using Crunchbang, and it's like I'm using a brand new computer again -- lightning fast &amp; responsive.  

Since I feed my family by typing semi-random characters in editors all day, I don't want my OS getting in the way of getting work done.  For the longest time Mint was the best at providing that.

I have installed all of the indicator applets, including the messaging applet.  Isn't it silly that we don't have an official ability to integrate Thunderbird with this menu, as it is in Ubuntu?

I hate having an e-mail application cluttering up my tint2.  It's not an application that I check, unless I'm writing a message or being alerted to an incoming message.  Having that messaging applet up there is exactly the kind of thing I want.  

I tried the latest version of libnotify-mozilla (1.4) that I found on the developer's abandoned blog.  All that seems to do is this:[http://i.imgur.com/thds1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/thds1.jpg)

It does not behave as I expected.  I thought that it would show a number of unread messages.  When Thunderbird is closed, the mention of Thunderbird actually disappears from the messaging applet.  

Does anyone have a solution to this?  I'd like Thunderbird to just be running up in the applet, similar to how Transmission runs (closing the program leaves it in the indicator applet).  I'm surprised that all we have right now is a broken analogy to Ubuntu's messaging menu."	t5_2ro56	True

In Windows the super key opens the menu. Currently in Linux Mint this is not the case. I do, however, feel the super key could be used for many other keyboard combinations. So, how would you want the menu to open by default, or are you happy with the way that it opens currently?(I know there is already a way you can change this in the settings)

Currently when you open the menu the cursor is set to the search box. This is great, but I wish that it let me tab through my selection instead of using the up and down arrows. Does anyone have any objection to this? Would you like it to be a setting in the preferences?

So I recently bought an Asus Notebook (The Ux31 Series Ultra Slim) and it came pre-installed with Windows 7 (Which is fine, I need Windows for school and at least it's not Windows 8 right?).

I decided that I wasn't happy with just Windows so I looked into ways to dual boot with Mint. I used Mint4Win and created a 20gb partition. I booted into the Mint side and it works great, all the things I use have functioning drivers, except for one small problem: The wireless range is much shorter in Mint than it is in Windows. When I'm on the Windows side I can be outside and still get signal, when I'm on the Mint side I have to be within ~7m of the router to get anything.

Does anybody know what could be wrong here? I'm honestly baffled.

Now, I was hoping to install Mint on my desktop PC, dual-booted with Windows 7 (for one of my games that doesn't work under WINE). Downloaded and booted the LiveUSB, and... black screen after the GRUB boot menu. I determined it's some kind of graphics issue. My monitor's native res is 1680x1050@60Hz, and I'm using a nVidia GeForce 9500GT dedicated card.

 A few Googles later, I booted GRUB and added ""nomodeset"" to the command line, which got me into the Live desktop in an ugly 1024x768 resolution. Installed Mint, rebooted, aaand... black screen. From there, I played around and Googled a bit more, and got into the installed desktop, again with ""nomodeset"" and 1024x768. 

From there, I installed the nVidia ""Recommended"" proprietary 310 drivers through the new Driver Manager. Now, my Mint install boots cleanly to... 640x480, and I can't set anything higher. I've fiddled with a few things (removing the nouveau packages for one), and nothing has helped. I'm worried about hopelessly breaking something at this point. My guess is, Mint can't find the supported resolutions from my monitor, but I'm not not sure.

I'm not a n00b, but still very new to Linux on a technical level, and I'd like a little assistance in walking through either fixing this problem or reinstalling from scratch and bypassing the issue from the start.

I have worked really hard to solve this on my own but alas I am a Linux novice.  I have an AMD Radeon 7850. I downloaded the latest drivers from AMD.  I used a guide I found online to walk through the installation.  It seemed to go smoothly.  I can now open up the ATI Catalyst Control Center. 

When I go to ""System Settings - Details"" in Mint though it shows my Graphics as VESA:01.  

The reason I think this is an issue is because I installed Steam and several games from it and they won't work.  Well a few of the more basic ones do like FTL and World of Goo but ones like Bastion and Team Fortress 2 do not.  Team Fortress 2 gives me an OpenGL not responding error.  They both open and I hear sound but its just a black screen.

I feel like the graphics drives must not be installed right.  This has always been my issue with Linux.  I have wanted to be a heavier Linux user for years now through many computers and I always end up beating my head against my desk for driver issues.

Anyways, I noticed that with the Ubuntu installer, LVM support now seems to work properly. Well, it appears to. I just installed LM14 into my LVM (basic setup, ext3 /boot partition also on LVM) and the install went great. However, upon reboot, no combination of voodoo and finger-crossing can get any reaction from my machine when I try to boot Mint.


It'll still boot into my non-Mint OSes just fine, but with or without splash/quiet, I don't even get an error. Just a blank page. Anyone else use Mint inside of an LVM, or try installing 14 into an LVM yet that might be able to shed some light? At least with 14RC, I was able to get it to mostly boot, before locking up... but with the final release, I get nothing.

EDIT: I'm a dunce. I assumed (foolishly) that since the new installer supports installation onto LVM partitions that it would install lvm2 by default. So to anyone else who wants to through LM14 onto an LVM, just make sure to mount everything and chroot in and install the lvm2 package. After that, everything was dandy.

The first thing I wanted to do in Mint 12 was to move the task bar down to the bottom... but now it involves having to install extensions form some random developer in some specific order (move the clock, hide the bottom bar, etc. etc).  Seriously what the fuck?  

This may seem trivial but, frankly, Mint being a comfortable and familiar interface is what drew me to it in the first place. I wouldn't mind this either if I could just quickly reposition this thing, without jumping through a bunch of hoops (yeah some herp out there will tell me to derp this and derp that, all realllllly easy for them).  That's not the point.  Something this trivial, that has been available for so long... what the hell are they improving upon that I can't do something so trivial?

Hey all, so NetworkManager won't list available wireless networks or even acknowledge my usb wifi card is available. First off, I'm on a laptop with a built in wifi card that has a on/off hardware switch. The hardware switch is set to 'off', and broken, so I can not set it to 'on'. What I've noticed is this affects my usb wifi card. NetworkManager tells me that both cards are hardware disabled, and won't use either one. This issue didn't actually pop up until after I installed, when running from a live usb stick NetworkManager functions perfectly, leading me to believe that I can get NetworkManager functioning on my hdd install as it should.

My usb wifi card isn't being blocked by rfkill, and I'm actually able to use it if I set it up and configure it by hand using wpa_supplicant. The card itself works, it's just NetworkManager refuses to use the card. It's a Ralink RT2770 wireless adapter, using the rt2800usb kernel module.

Is there any way to get NetworkManager working with my card? Or will I just have to keep NetworkManager disabled and continue using wpa_supplicant? It'd just be nice to have the convenience and flexibility back with NetworkManager and not have to set every wifi network up manually. Any help is appreciated.

Also, if there is any way I can bypass the broken hardware switch and use the internal wifi that'd be awesome. The internal card is a (from lspci) 'Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection' and uses the 'iwl3945' kernel module. Rfkill won't unblock it, unfortunately.

I was hoping maybe I might be able to get some help here. I'm wanting to try out Linux, and, after looking at the options, I think I'd like to go with Mint. My laptop is currently running Windows 8.

I grabbed the 64-bit iso with Cinnamon. I mounted it onto a flash drive, since my laptop has no optical drive. I looked around, and saw some mention of a secure boot, and having to turn it off before trying, but I poked around in my BIOS settings, and saw none. 

I plugged in the flash drive, and booted directly to it. After 2 seconds, either activity (hitting enter on installing Linux Mint) or in-activity, my screen goes black, and it appears that my laptop went into sleep mode, except I can't hit a key or touch the mouse to bring it back to life.

Possible?	xanderstrike	7	2	1	"I just switched to Mint XFCE from Xubuntu, and I'm loving just about everything. One issue though is that I have a variety of sound devices (Realtek motherboard card, nvidia hdaudio, and USB headphones). The built in mixer, based on ALSA it appears, is useless. It lets me control the volume of all the devices, but doesn't let me change the default sink so all audio comes out of my motherboard card which I don't use.

I've started using the Pulse Audio volume control (pavucontrol) which lets me chose the default sink, plus a bunch of other useful features. However, the sound applet and volume keys don't respect changes I make with pavucontrol, so they both continue to only affect the motherboard card, even when it's not in use. This is frustrating because I have to actually start pavucontrol whenever I want to change the volume in my headphones, instead of being able to use the buttons on it.

Doing so helped make a tremendous difference in speed. It now feels snappy like windows 8 which I am very relieved about. Others mentioned issues still exist(battery life....etc..) but I am happy now. 


I am new to Linux. I messed around with both Ubuntu and BackTrack 5 (in a virtual box) since I was interested in the whole linux ecosystem. However, being a CS major, I decided to dual boot Linux Mint 14 and use it as a primary OS alongside windows 8. I find that Linux Mint 14 (cinnamon) runs relatively slow compared to windows 8. I can see there's a bit of lag and overall the OS doesn't feel like its running the way its described on forums. For example the menu doesn't open up quickly when I click on it. There is a slight but noticeable lag. In addition, I downloaded nexuiz, and i found it next to impossible to alt-tab out of nexuiz to check a message on facebook (it lost track of my mouse and no longer was detecting it, i could walk around but not look around). I also found that when i closed the lid on my laptop, i got a black screen when I reopened it. I was unable to get out of the black screen without restarting by holding the power button. I also found batter life to suffer. On windows 8 i get roughly 5 3/4 hours of battery life but on linux only 2.5 hours fully charged. I tried playing with brightness settings to no real difference. (In windows 8 even on high performance settigns, I managed better battery life). Please let me know what's going on because I have read that Linux mint runs smoother than windows 8 which I haven't experienced.

When you enter the ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa resource, it automatically sets the distro to look for to ""maya""

SO:  
1. open Software Sources  
2. add ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa  
3. right clock on the resource you just added and hit edit  
4. change the ""Distrobution"" tab to ""precise""

Performing a ""Xorg -configure"" and copying the newly created xorg.conf over the one in /etc/X11/ via Recovery Mode will give me one ""good"" boot before the problem recurs. No proprietary drivers, but I am using a relatively new ATI graphics card. I've gone through all troubleshooting I could uncover online. Read below for full details, please. My most recently created xorg.conf is pasted below, at the bottom of the post.**

The Live CD (okay, USB stick) works fine (both monitors function, programs run, etc.). I am able to install Linux Mint 11 64-bit (Gnome ""DVD"" edition) without a hitch, as a matter of fact.

Upon rebooting, I get the nice Mint splash screen and GRUB, and I can start Mint itself just fine.

Upon ""first boot,"" I get a black screen on my main monitor, with a ""waiting/working"" mouse cursor (circular, spinning dots around the edge). My secondary monitor begins to flash white against the black, slowly at first, then faster until it's almost painful to look at.

Following advice I've seen elsewhere for older versions, I reboot into ""Recovery Mode"" and give myself a Net-enabled root prompt. The first time, I just jumped into ""netinit 3"" or something like that (I can't find the forum post I was following anymore, sadly) and then performed an Xorg -configure, then copied the newly created xorg.conf into /etc/X11 and rebooted.

It will come up fine and dandy once. I rebooted, just to test, and the flickering returned.

Throughout the evening, I've tried applying all outstanding updates (succeeds if done via the GUI, tends to fail out most of the way through if done via command prompt, ending in a repeating series of ""device not ready"" errors), activating the ""proprietary drivers,"" and flat-out deleting xorg.conf and rebooting.

It ends in one of three states: a single ""working"" boot, a ""flashing secondary monitor"" boot, or, weirdly, a ""dead secondary monitor"" boot. The last one looks totally normal on my primary (X loads, GUI comes up, I login, etc.), but my secondary monitor seems to have a huge grey ""box"" pasted over the desktop (this happens whether I mirror or not). I can just barely see the cursor if I move it to the very top of the screen, perhaps about 2 pixels worth, but the rest is flat grey.

Installing the proprietary drivers ended worse than most attempts, as the computer refused to boot completely, citing it was trying to read the battery status--remember that this is a Desktop computer!--and hanging repeatedly. I actually had to format the Linux drive and reinstall entirely after that, but the behavior returned.

I do nothing else unusual in my setup. It's being installed on a working drive that's partitioned to give Linux about 40 gigs, plus 8 gigs of swap as a separate partition, with about 500 gigs of Windows data following in yet another partition (this is where I store a partial backup of some of my data, and it's succeeded quite recently, filling most of the remaining space, so it's unlikely the drive is bad. SMART data agrees).

It's a relatively modern PC--AMD Phenom II X4 945 (3.0ghz, no overclocking), 4GB of DDR 2 RAM, and an ATI Radeon HD6870 1GB PCI Express Card. All hardware appears functional and Windows 7 is able to boot and use both monitors with ease.

I've checked cables (fine--remember, Windows is okay), reinstalled, and re-created xorg.conf multiple times--I'm not even playing with stuff line Xinemera here!

Any ideas on what to do?

Thank you for reading!

( Though I did put the desktop back to Gnome2 standard layout. ;-) )  Debian testing with the spit and polish required for a desktop for my wife and any of our guests.

We have to use Skype for video calls because that is what our families are using, for now at least.
Skype audio input from the webcam doesn't work properly. With PulseAudio installed, it records as high speed chipmonks. Without PulseAudio, it doesn't record us at all.

But this isn't the end of the story, if you start up anything that uses video from the webcam, everything is fine. Both with and without PulseAudio. If you shutdown the thing using the video of the webcam, audio continues to be fine. But if you start a new call, the audio is messed up again.

Trying other applications, like Audacity, it records fine without this behavior.

Anyone else had this and what did they do to work round it? Just open the webcam video in vlc before making or taking a call? Not nice.....  I understand OSSv4 doesn't support usb audio devices well, so that's not a solution (though I prefer it's design to ALSA/PA).

The old Ubuntu 32bit partition (I always have two distros installed, old and new) still boots and doesn't do any of this. Maybe it's something to do with the way Skype is 32bit and wrapped with compatibility stuff to run on 64bit.

If anyone has a guide or suggestions on how to do that let me know.


But, looking into some other options, I could possibly install mint onto a virtual machine from within Windows, setting the virtual hard drive to be on the new hard drive, and then encrypt the new hard drive with TrueCrypt. Would this work well for general use?

Plus, I have to go through the painful process of repeating these steps at each reboot. I don't know why it keeps picking the older smaller monitor as the primary, but it does.

So it is the same grind. Restart, open NVidia Xserver settings, move monitor over to the right of the other monitor, make the nice monitor primary then hit apply. All my window decorations plus all UI elements and keyboard go dead at this point so then I execute my shell script. Now AWN is gone, and my keyboard shortcuts are off the screen.

/boot 500MB ext4
/ 20GB ext4
/home 295GB ext4
swap 4GB

I pointed the boot installer to the /boot partition, and then hit install and went through the user setup process.  Once it's all done and I restart, it hangs up right after the BIOS screen.  I've checked to confirm that the USB is boot priority, and I've tried manually selecting it as the boot device.

So far nothing has worked, so I figured I'd appeal to your collective wisdom.  Thanks in advance!

I did a fresh install last week, and while everything seems to be working just as well, I found two issues. 

The first is that my system clock is always 5 to 45 minutes behind. I'm wired directly into the router, and my cell phone and cable tv both tell me it's now 8:53 am. My system clock, though, says 8:12. I've logged out and in, told it to use network time (or not), and while I've managed to update the time several times this past week, apparently it only updates when the PC is idle and I'm not using it. 

The second issue is that it no longer sleeps/wakes consistently the way it did under 11. I had the Power settings hibernate the PC if it was idle for several hours; even though it's plugged in all the time, there's no point in keeping it powered up. Now the only option seems to be to sleep and wake, and it hangs on waking. I've now changed the Power setting to ""Don't suspend.""

The last one I can live with, but the clock thing is really bugging me.

I've got a friend that needed a computer to start job searching on.  She's only had job issued laptops before and no longer has access to them anymore do to a layoff.  Needless to say she can't afford to by a laptop so I dug around my spare stuff and cobbled together a desktop and would run linux mint 13 cinnamon.

I'm a linux admin with a lot of redhat based experience and very little debian knowledge, but I'm not worried about myself.  She's a strict MS Windows person but I don't have access to Windows OS or office so I didn't want to go there.

I've played around with Mint a bit before I decided to go that route and I liked what I saw.  I'm planning on rolling it out for my family over this weekend.  

But back to my issue.  I would like to give my friend a ""user manual"" for mint, really basic stuff than any end user would need.  I would be doing most of the tech support on the box (installed teamview already - works fine but would like something better) so I'm not worried about the harder stuff yet.

I've looked around and seen a lot of ""how to install"" type docs, but not really any ""how to use"" type stuff.  Any ideas other than sit down with her and show her this and that (granted I'm not sure where everything is either but I'm a lot more technical than she is)

I've decided to go with a VM of WinXP and use that for what ever Windows only applications I need at work. I have a couple questions before I do this. 

I have kind of an old laptop, its an HP Pavilion running a Dual Core 2GHz processor, and a 320 GB HDD, I'll be installing LM 12 64bit. (BTW, act like the rest of this post is ELI5).

 - I know there are few VM clients that run on Linux, which should I use and why?

 - How much room should I allot to WinXP VM?

 - Will I be able to smoothly run multiple applications at the same time within my VM?

 - Will I be able to run multiple applications outside of the VM while it's running? (i.e. switch back and forth between LM and VM)

 - If you could point me to a good ELI5(ish) post or article on how to set up this VM, that would be fantastic. 


Thank you for your help, I look forward to joining the Linux Mint team soon.

I installed the RC and have just upgraded since, not sure if this is related.

Neither of these areas (grub nor bootsplash) are things I tend to mess with unless I have a problem.  But OTOH I don't really enjoy watching a black screen for 20 secs with only my hdd light to tell me it's booting.

* LXDE login will not show a mouse/arrow on the screen until after you login or wait 15 seconds

* Multiple Software Update Icons in system tray when opening desktop
* System will not save mouse settings(I use a laptop and have to disable touchpad clicking every session)
* Desktop icons will not stay aligned or will give me destination errors when trying to move/arrange them
* When deleting files from external usb devices, i will get destination errors

I have used Ubuntu and Fedora for years and have never had these issues. I believe they are more LXDE related, since it is still a young desktop. I am looking more to see if anyone else **HERE** has run into any of these issues and if they have been addressed by LXDE, Linux Mint, or the community. Thank you.

I understand why this is, but I don't what to do about it.

I'm a super-newb when it comes to Linux.  I don't understand the partioning tool however.  Would it help if I reformatted the extra partition to something different, like FAT32?

I installed Linux Mint 9 this morning, in a dual boot capacity with Windows 7.  Currently, I am unable to connect to the internet via wireless.  I installed the Broadcom STA drivers and rebooted.

When I try to connect it does everything correctly, tells me it's connected, then immediately disconnects.  Well, I assume that everything is being done correctly.  So far, no luck with the wireless.

I know wireless is often an issue on first installs and that there are as many different causes as Tiger Woods had mistresses.  If anyone has any experience with a similar issue to this, please let me know.  Searching through the internets just leads to people with a wireless issue, just not this particular wireless issue.

I have noticed that some of the programs I am using do not seem to take their font configuration from that source.

gedit also has this issue with menu fonts as well as the default font used for editing.  When I look at the font and colors preference tab for gedit I see that it shows ""Use the system fixed width font (Monospace 10)"" - and that selection is checked.   I configured Monospace 7 in the system configuration/font tool, why is it not being used by gedit?

     

I've tried using gnome-tweak-tool to see if there is additional font settings that are not shown within the system-config/font applet - but they all match.

Ok. Now Check your menu. See? There's no Google Chrome icon. (at least in Cinnamon this is what happens) ... so let's create it:

* right click on the Mint Menu and choose Edit menu.
* click Internet then ""New item""

**Background**: About two years ago, I told a pal of mine to buy some aluminum foil.  Upon his return, he threw it in such a way that the corner of foil hit it my laptop's 'M' key, dislodging it.  Overtime, the key became less and less responsive, eventually ceasing to function altogether.

At the time I used some windows utility to remap my **Right Alt** and '**M**' keys.  Over the last year I completely migrated to mint.  From searching around, it seems like xkeycaps is the most popular way mint users remap keys.  However, when logging out or restarting, all changes are reverted.  It's pretty tedious to go through xkeycaps once every login, so generally I've been keeping a spare 'm' in my clipboard.  Yes, all m's in this post have been copy/pasted from reddit.co**m** URL.

**Question** - how can I remap my Right Alt (or swap it) to act as an '*M*' in xkeycaps or some other program permanently?  Or alternately, is there a sound way to (I guess) script the key swap during login?"	t5_2ro56	True

For instance, at Ubuntu it was a constant problem. At Linux Mint my laptop had to shutdown by itself because of the summer heat which was quite a shock for me! Windows 7 is working fine though which led me to believe that it's a graphics card problem. I searched a lot but to no avail -I got really confused.

Especially after I went to All Settings &gt; Details -under Linux Mint- and saw the Overview near graphics saying: Gallium 0.4 on AMD RV710, my suspicions seemed to be justified because I think that I have an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4500 Series (as Windows 7 informs me).

* 2) Do you know how to install the correct drivers? I don't understand that part very much because I am new to Linux, but I want to learn!

"	brightlycolored	5	1	1	"Hi all, I have been using cinnamon over Ubuntu 12.04 on a little partition of my MacBook Pro 8,1 and have absolutely loved it. I dread having to boot back into Mac OS now. So instead of having linux over a tiny test partition of my drive (I was not so sure installation would go smoothly, for good reason!) I would like to make it my main OS, with a small Mac OS parition for occasional artsy stuff/games. 
   
I was hoping to get some extra opinions on how best to do this, to avoid disaster. Here is what I'm thinking now:

* Boot up to my Mac OS install CD and erase and reformat the entire HD to the Mac OS format. 
* Make the main blank, unformatted partition for linux and install Mac OS on what's left over. 
* Boot up from the Mint CD and use gparted to format the larger, blank partition for use with Mint. *This part I'm not super sure about*, I feel like there were probably some things I did not do last time because booting into Ubuntu now (and even Mac OS!) is a little *off*.
* Shut down (the fan does not work automatically in *not* Mac OS, so it will probably need a cool-down before installing a new OS), boot from the Mint CD again and install Mint on the newly formatted (ext4?) partition. 
* Enjoy a superior main operating system?

I would like  to set up a Linux weekend at the Uni where students expand networks and learn more about linux computing, resources and issues surrounding computing.

Students staff and community members should bring in old laptops and netbooks, preferably, but also desktops for Linux Mint installs.  Mint flavours would be available to try out. Also, live CD's  would be on offer. 

Open source advocacy and or information booths and the event should be totally voluntary and free to the public.  (If no security issues arise)

On Offer
Linux OS'es and computer OS installs (alongside windows/Mac or as replacement)

I would like a lxde/Bodhi section for the oldies and on offer to all.

Computer OS install workshops...

try out computer banks and perhaps a demonstration or lecture to take place alongside drop in installs and (perhaps) workshops.

Aim
to equip students, in a triple dip recession, with computing knowledge and skills that are productive for social professional and educational life.

To make accessible open source software to the general learning community

Just a couple of days ago, however, the login screen presented itself after starting the machine up, but the keyboard and mouse refused to work. I tried an external mouse and keyboard with no difference. The cursor was blinking, so it definitely wasn't frozen. Magic system request allowed me to reboot the system, only to find it did the same thing. GRUB2 at boot allowed me to use my keyboard with no problems, however. 

I booted from a live USB drive (Mint 14 as well) and was able to control everything just fine. Thinking it could have been a recent X or Nvidia driver update that killed it, I booted to the hard disk again issuing ""text"" in the kernel boot line from GRUB2. I was able to roll back to a previous X version, as well as getting rid of Nvidia drivers completely (relying on the built-in Intel graphics). After `startx`, I found that there was absolutely no difference.

I kept a separate `/home` partition, so reloading the OS wasn't that big of a deal. However, I am certainly worried that this could happen again for no apparent reason. What should I look for? I thought for sure it'd be an Xserver issue, as that seems to handle all of the keyboard and mouse input. The kernel seemed ""awake"" to the keyboard, since magic system request commands still work. 

Again, it is all fixed now by a fresh install, but surely I don't have to do a complete fresh install when I still have access to all of my files, the internet, etc., all from a text-only boot. Are there any other options for next time, if there is a next time?

They were full-screen video in high resolution (1080p). Everything was looking good until one of the videos finished, when the screen suddenly went from normal to gray to white all of a sudden. I quickly went over to another TTY, logged in, and as soon as it was ready to display the $ prompt, the TTY also went all white. Switching to any TTY between 1 and 7 displayed only white. I had an unsaved document open, so I didn't want to just shut off the computer, but I knew that killing the DM would also kill any open applications associated with it. I then logged into my machine from another computer and killed Google Chrome, which was where the video was playing. This did stop Chrome, as the video that was queued next was currently playing (sound was still coming out of the speaker) and was immediately halted after `sudo killall chrome`. This did not fix the white screen, however. Eventually, I gave in, and a `sudo service mdm restart` brought the computer back to the Mint login screen.

For whatever reason when I exit wine (with or without errors) the fonts in whatever windows I bring up (after) are super small. It's like something in wine decreases the font size or something; I don't know.

If I have a gvim window open before I start playing a game it'll have all the proper proportions when I come out, but if I were to close that window and then open the file again it'd have a barely readable font size.

It's incredibly annoying and while it's not something I'd change OS over I find it just annoying enough to have to check out whatever solutions people might have. I've googled about it and all I can find that's remotely related is about other fonts not really working settings-wise at all (while mine actually do work overall; it's just wine or whatever that seems to bugger stuff up).

(Edit: Let it be known I'm not _entirely_ sure it's wine, but I've yet to notice this without exiting wine. It may very well be some resolution change stuff or whatever, I don't know.)

New edit: Confirmed to not be exclusive to wine. After having exited a screen saver (OpenGL based, I highly suspect) fonts are sized down. Must be something about the OGL init/deinit that messes up fonts."	t5_2ro56	True

Honestly, the only 2 things I care about on a laptop are the screen and keyboard.

T7700(2.4GHz), 3GB RAM, 100GB 7200RPM Hard Drive, 15.4in 1920x1200 LCD, 256MB nVIDIA Quadro FX 570M, CDRW/DVDRW, Intel 802.11agn wireless, Bluetooth, Modem, SD Card Slot, 1Gb Ethernet, UltraNav, Sec Chip, FingerPrint Reader, 6c Li-Ion, XP Pro. Price was $400 shipped. I made sure it had good Linux compatibility before I purchased it.

Upon receiving it, I never even let it boot into Windows. I swapped the hard drive with a 128Gb SSD I had lying around and threw 64bit Mint 11 on it. With a few tweaks here and there and after installing all of my favorite programs, everything works perfectly. The 1920x1200 screen is amazing. I'm also glad I don't have to deal with the usual Broadcom wl bullshit, it has Intel wifi.

Each distribution promised solutions that the other didn't have. Finally, after installing a few distros on the main computer, my girlfriend(Windows user) expressed concern. She didn't like the current(I won't name any names) distro. I asked her what she did like. She said, ""I liked the mint one, the one with all the green. It was really easy to get used to"" Oh yes, she was referring to Linux Mint 9 with the matrixish background. I told her that there had been an update, showed her a screenshot. She said she liked what she saw., so I started the download and went to work(like my place of employment).

That night I came home, burn the ISO, and popped it in. I told her how to boot off a CD, then I hopped in the shower. She performed about 90% of the install. The only thing she wasn't sure about was the ""Do you want to unmount partitions"" step and the actual disk partitioning. I led her in the right direction, and sure enough 20 minutes later we had a working Linux Mint box. She even took the time to read the information presented during the install telling her about all the new features.

She seemed excited(well as excited as a Linux geeks-girlfriend can get over a computer). She thought it looked all very nice, polished, and welcoming. 

Now me, I am severely impressed by this distro. Everything works great. I had to remove 64 bit flash and install 32 bit+nspluginwrapper to get hulu to work, but that wasn't a big deal. I am upgrading to the mint-meta-gnome-dvd package as I type. 

This has been the simplest distro to set up. I love how the update manager protects me from my stupidity. This does not mean that I am an idiot that doesn't know how to use a computer. I just want to be able to use the computer for things that I need to and have the operating system take care of the rest. A few days ago in Ubuntu I did an upgrade that messed up my resolution. The forums had me digging though xorg.conf. I never got it figured out. What I like about Linux Mint is that it doesn't expect you to know how to do that. If I wanted a complex distro I would have complied everything from source. I want to use my computer, not have it use me. I am not saying anything bad about those that choose to use complex distros. More power to ya! I have used them, learned, and came back to simplicity. I am just at the point where I want to be able to use Linux, stay up to date, and not have to spend 6 hours trying to fix my computer after something breaks it. Linux Mint does this.

Two weeks ago I started my internship and since then I'm using Linux on my laptop (firstly Ubuntu, then moved to Mint as it was more Windows-like).  
  
Yesterday decided to remove Windows from my desktop (completely) and install Mint 15. Well I love it, some things feel better. But I really miss Photoshop and will miss Word when I need it.  
  
What's the best/easiest way of running Photoshop now? By using Wine, Virtual Machine, Dual booting Windows or removing Linux and returning to Win.  
  
Wine sounds like a cool idea (if it won't be too slow), but I have troubles using it. Do I need the Photoshop CD to install it or?

  
And can I dual boot Win7 from Mint, or I have to remove Mint, install Windows and then dual boot Mint?

OS: dualboot Vista/Mint 15 (prev. Vista/Ubuntu 13.04)

I want to be clear, this is apparently something to do with Ubuntu rather than discretely a Mint issue, but as I'm running Mint 15, I'm asking here.

I had Ubuntu 12.10 and it worked fine. Then I upgraded to 13.04 and that's when the problem started. After a lot of frustration trying to solve it, I somehow broke it: I was for some reason unable to restore the audio to its install state. Feeling I'd finally had enough, I reinstalled fresh with Mint 15, assuming that would fix it. It did not, though I'm sticking with Mint anyway.

The problem is this: Audio works normally over speakers. And the headphone jack cutout works properly, too: When I plug in the headphones, the speaker audio cuts out. And alsamixer shows everything working as it should. However, no sound comes through the headphones at all.

I've tested the headphones separately, and they work fine.

This is pretty frustrating, because it means I can't use my headphones at all, for anything, until it's solved. Any ideas, I'm all ears (so to speak).

It was running Windows Vista with severe lag issues after I performed a factory reset. The stock battery was DOA so I purchased a replacement. In Windows, the new battery was recognized and charged normally.

I have since installed Mint 15 MATE on the computer, and the replacement battery was not recognized and would not charge. Thinking that perhaps I got a bunk replacement battery (it was quite inexpensive but with decent reviews), I returned it and purchased another of a different brand. The second replacement battery will not charge.

As it worked in Vista, I suspect that this could be an operating system issue? I have checked the Dell website for drivers but Linux of any variety does not seem to be supported. I have searched forums and links galore with no luck.

TL;DR - 2007 Dell Inspiron with fresh Linux Mint installation will not recognize or charge any batteries

1366168051.0	1cic6k	Getting M4a/AAC/ALAC files to work with Songbird on Linux Mint	Hip-Hopster	4	2	2	"Finally figured this out, and since there's not a lot of documentation out there for Mint on this problem, I thought I'd add a quick guide for future Googlers and anyone else on here that's curious.


Now I presume you tried to play a song and a dialog box appeared saying something along the lines of 

    ""[song] was unable to play because the decoder (MPEG-4 AAC decoder) can not be found""

This just means that you are missing a few codecs, or more likely, Songbird doesn't know you have them.

The process for fixing this is simple and can be broken into 3 steps:
_________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Check that you have gstream-ffmpeg (Normally comes default w/ install). Easiest way to do this is open up a terminal and type:

         sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg     
     This will will install it you don't have it, will tell you if you do
_________________________________________________________________________________________
2. In the same terminal window, type 

          whereis songbird
This should be something like ""/usr/bin/songbird /usr/bin/X11/songbird""
copy to the ""best"" location, most likely /usr/bin/songbird.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
3. In the terminal type:
    
        sudo gedit /usr/bin/songbird

This will open a script file. Once there add the following after the last export line:

    export SB_GST_SYSTEM=1

Save and exit, then restart songbird. Should work now!

I'm not exactly a new user to Linux Mint/ Ubuntu. Been swapping between these and Windows for a few years, but I have never become a much of a ""Super User"". I have always just appreciated how simply I can make my computers run and look beautiful, and haven't had to do much configuring besides a little command line copy + pasting. 

I switched my lappy (Acer Aspire) back over to LM14 once I read an article about Netflix working on Ubuntu. In the past, this has been something that made me shy away from a full-time install of Ubuntu/ LM [Article](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/how-to-get-netflix-streaming-on-ubuntu-1210/4019)

The good news: Netflix runs on my desktop, full screen, and is generally beautiful!

The bad news: Running Netflix will make any other program I am running freeze/ glitch up. Netflix itself is similarly glitchy if I try to swap to another workspace to check email etc. ""pkill""ing Netflix doesn't always work, and will lock up Terminal until I ""pkill terminal"". 

I know this is just a great excuse to hone my skills and earn my right as a Linux OS user, but I am honestly only marginally more competent than your average Win7 user. A modest google search hasn't yielded much. I signed up for the LM forums, but appreciate the rapid replies and user base when using Reddit in other aspects of my life.

Yesterday, while trying to get some games working, I decided to install the official Radeon HD 6xxx series driver, from the AMD website. The driver installation went smoothly, but afterwards all applications requiring OpenGL stopped working, complaining about a missing *libgl.so.1* file.

I tried restarting Linux Mint, but it wouldn't boot correctly, simply launching into a black screen. I assume that there is some issue in the AMD driver that I installed that breaks graphics completely.

I also tried booting from my Linux Mint Debian install CD, but it wouldn't boot - there's only a blank prompt when I try to use it.

I think that the way to fix the problem is to boot into some sort of text-only mode that doesn't use X and then undo the driver installation, but I have no idea how to do that.

I put Linux Mint on it (dual boot). It looks like everything works (sound etc.), except the wifi.

So I went [here](http://www.mediatek.com/_en/07_downloads/01_windows.php?sn=501) and downloaded the source for the driver. I extracted the source, directed a terminal to the directory and ran ""$ sudo make"". Then I did ""$ sudo make install"".

I searched around the webs and found some commands that I've since forgotten that pretty much tell me that linux recognizes that there is a device there, but there is no driver bound to the device.

This angers me.

I need help. I refuse to give up this time. I WILL have a linux machine that can get on the internet.

Once I had a new hard drive I thought I would try something new so I made a Mint LiveUSB and booted from it. Looked pretty hideous, with the stainless steel colours everywhere, but I figured I could change it easily enough so I just went ahead and installed it.

But now can't change it easily enough and it's driving me crazy.

-------- 

Question: why the fuck are there three separate themes in effect at once? 

* ""Cinnamon theme"", for the various panels and 'start menu' (dark brown/grey), 
* plus a ""window theme"", for the title bar and border of open windows (hideous light grey), 
* plus the ""GTK+ theme"" for the 'inside' bits of a window (changes colour per active window. (And changes the colour on every open window, based on the active window!!))

It's ugly and inconsistent, and there is no unified option that will keep all three themes in sync. What the fuck is this? Why can't the Cinnamon theme override the other two and keep the whole UI consistent?

I unplugged my ethernet cable, booted up another live distro, did some work, and then rebooted back into my  linux mint desktop. No internet. 

I figured out pretty fast that the issue was because I forgot to re-connect the cable. However, after reconnecting, I could not get my network working again without doing a reboot. (computer is plugged into a FiOS ""modem"", DHCP, IPv4, NAT, etc)

I clicked on the network icon on the lower right of my taskbar, and tried to reconfigure, but to no avail. I probably could have gotten into the terminal and gotten my MAC address, and maybe gone from there, but it was easier to reboot. That worked.

I consider this a defect, because my expected behavior is that a background process would keep trying to auto-configure or reconnect using the last valid method.

I took a quick look at http://mate-desktop.org/support/  but could not find where they track bugs.

To reproduce: 

1. disconnect wired ethernet cable.  
2. reboot
3. log back in as a non-privileged user.
4. plug ethernet cable back in.
5. note that network connection is not automatically connected.
6. reboot a second time and log in to verify that probing during boot works and restores ethernet connection.

2. should I check for dupes / report this bug to Linux Mint or MATE?

* Batteries: Main battery and bay battery which yields about 5 hours of runtime total (3.5 with just the main)
* Memory: 544MB PC100, up from 64MB PC66 (32MB is onboard, still need to repair the solder joints on one slot but that's easy)
* Network: Came with just a modem, now has wireless N via the PCMCIA slot
* Processor: Went from a PII 400 or 450 (I forget) to a PIII-650 (which runs at 500 because I haven't hardware-locked it yet)

That last point is where the twist comes in. Due to this machine never being intended for a PIII at all the BIOS doesn't recognize it and therefore doesn't enable the L2 cache. This would make it next to worthless because it would be painfully slow at everything... not that it's a speed demon now but it's at least usable. I've got a hacked version of Grub on there that enables the cache and it *needs* to stay there.

Is there a way to upgrade the system to Mint 11 LXDE live without hosing everything up?

Suggestions to get a new laptop will be downvoted and ignored unless they also include a proffer of paying for it. *(but if someone does they can have the Thinkpad! And its floppy drive too!)*

---

*note: The BIOS got slightly hacked to disable a showstopper error message that the unrecognized processor generated, this is the technical reason L2 never gets turned on... it's basically getting bypassed. If I were more skilled I'd just add the processor ID data to the BIOS directly and then it could run whatever I threw at it. If anyone here can h4x0r an old IBM BIOS that'd beat the shit out of this stupid grub hack.*"	t5_2ro56	True

Now, I love LMDE, but I'd like to see a more up-to-date version of Firefox in it.  It's still at 5.0, I was a little surprised at first, considering that it's supposed to be made of recent packages.

I have installed DockbarX so I can use Windows 7 style shortcuts with the option *Use Unity style number shortcuts (Super+number)*.

So I press Super+1 for browser, Super+3 for Terminal and so on.

But **when I press Super+2 it refuses to launch/focus the app, and instead it shows a white 1px border around the active window**. On Google Chrome it shows 1px white, 1pxblack, and another 1px white border.

Could this be something the window manager (Marco ) does? When I release the Super key, the white edge disappears.

1359507953.0	17j579	Linux Mint 14 won't boot after install on completely blank hard drive	thomasamadeusking	2	1	1	"Hey all,

So I need some help. I've tried three different installs now of Mint 14 - Xfce, KDE, and Cinnamon - on my blank 1TB hard drive in my new system. I have three hard drives - a 120GB solid state for Windows, a 1TB mechanical that's formatted NTFS for files, and the 1TB mechanical that I'm trying to install Mint on. I've tried literally every possible way to install it, and every time there's no way for me to boot into it.

If I keep my other two drives connected and tell the installer to install alongside Windows, when everything completes and I reboot, my computer just boots up Windows, with no sight of GRUB or any other boot-loader.

If I keep the other two drives connected and tell the installer exactly how I want everything partitioned (making sure to set aside space for a /boot directory, an EFI bootloader, a swap, and root) on my third drive, same thing. And when I go into my BIOS and tell it to boot from that disk, I get the following error:

""Reboot and Select proper Boot device
or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.""

When I press a key, it goes right into Windows.

If I UNPLUG my other two drives, leaving only the drive that I want it installed onto plugged in, regardless of whether I tell the installer to wipe the drive and start anew, or manually partition it, when I restart I see that same error (only it just keeps repeating after I press a key since my windows installation isn't connected to the system anymore).

I really have no idea what to do. I've installed Mint 14 on my laptop using several of the above approaches, and each time had perfect success. I don't know what's wrong. Any insight, advice, ideas, or sympathy will be greatly appreciated.

I can read/write to each drive. The annoying bits are seen in this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/k7QQ3.png

1. Why does Computer show duplicate entries for each drive? Ideally, I'd only want to see the 'tv', 'share', 'movies', but they don't seem to actually work. Whenever I try to open them, I get the error seen in the screenshot.

2. I wanted to rename the drives on the desktop, but that option is not enabled. I figured I would try ""shortcuts,"" but I can't seem to get them to not show up on my Desktop. I've used the gconf-editor to untick ""volumes_visible"" entry under nautilus -&gt; desktop, but it didn't change anything.

3. I've taken ownership of, and chmod 777, each of the drives. Still, they each contain a lost+found folder which I'm unable to modify. Is it necessary to have that folder? If not, how can I remove them?

My wireless connection is fairly stable like 99% of the time. Except when I go to one of my classes, where the wireless connection is shoddy at best; I can connect to the Internet sometimes, but it'll randomly disconnect, connect, disconnect, connect. No one else in my class seems to have trouble, but they're all on Windows and/or Mac computers. Is there any way to fix this? It's pretty necessary because I have to connect to the university server using Citrix to access some applications... and just as I was typing this I got disconnected. It doesn't happen anywhere else.

""Aha!"" sez me, it must be a VGA mode compatibility issue.  So ... I tried using vga=... on the command line of the boot kernel.  No go, this does not fix the problem.  After fiddling around with it for a few weeks, here's where I am:

- If I boot with ""nomodeset"" as an option to the kernel, the ttys come up properly, but X won't start

-  If I do not use ""nomodeset"", X starts, but I never see tty video either during boot or thereafter.

Do you notice what's missing? Right, the network icon. Why I said it's crucial, because it's my way to the internet, and Internet is important for me.

How am I supposed to connect to any network if it's missing. Well, actually the icon disappeared after connected to a network once. But, I can't change to other networks. Or after I suspend (sleep) the machine, I can't connect to any network.

I've triend to restart the notification-area-applet, or the NetworkManager, or even the mate-panel itself, but none has anything to do with that goddamn network icon. 

If anyone could help me with this, There's a chance I could still use Olivia. Ooh by the way, I haven't try Nadia at all. So, I prefer Maya instead.

I get that it's familiar, but it's also massively inefficient.  Most people keep their focus on the upper 1/2 to 2/3 of the screen.   

Every program keeps all of its menu items at the top.  People read from the top down.  By keeping the taskbar at the bottom you force people to mouse from the top to the bottom all the time.  

The only reason to go down there is to use the menu (which is already inefficient) or to click on any open window icons.  Wouldn't it be more efficient to put the taskbar somewhere else?  *Anywhere* else?  

The left and right sides maximize screen space on widescreen laptops and monitors, but you still have applets that would be at the bottom.  Putting the taskbar on the top maximizes the distance the mouse has to move to get anything done.  

With the ongoing battle over Unity and Gnome Shell and the Mint team's insistence on old paradigms, I'm curious why people like a less efficient (from a purely technical standpoint) UI.  Clem wouldn't have stayed with it if not for broad community support.  "	t5_2ro56	True

During the installation set up i had clicked on 'something else' (in order to dual boot), Now the next step is making the space for my linux mint which am having doubts with.

1.Do i have to click 'change' on a partition and choose my HDD (in order to create the size for my new partition) if so what options do i choose, for the 'use as' and 'mount point'
 drop down menues.

I did try creating a blank partition through Windows 7 but i was unable to locate it on my mint installation.

Any help is appreciated, and thank you in advance."	t5_2ro56	True

Relative Linux noob here. (Years of distant following including a couple of abortive installs due to not getting it. Linux is MUCH more noob-friendly in 2012 than ever, so have been heavily playing with Ubuntu/Mint/Puppy the last month.)

I run Mint 11 on my backup server and have that any transfers to my server's HDDs start fast and then slows down to unusable speeds.  This is transfers via ethernet (from my windows 7 machine) and locally via USB.  For example, transferring a 160gb file via USB starts at 11mbs (slow anyway) and slows to 4mbs after ~15 minutes. Transferring the same file via ethernet starts at 16mbs and then slows to &lt;3mbs. Transferring the same file to my Windows 7 machine runs constantly at 26mbs throughout the transfer.  

I have searched everywhere for help with this problem and found many people with the same issue but no solutions.  It is considered a bug in the ubuntu forums but still no solution despite it being reported as long as 4 years ago.  Does anyone have any ideas?

I am thinking about switching to Mint because I'm not sure I like the direction Canonical is taking.  I know Mint is derived from Ubuntu and uses Ubuntu repositories, but does that translate to the same hardware support?  The only time I tried Mint I had some trouble getting the graphics to work properly (Radeon Mobility HD 5650).  I need it to work well since this is my only computer and I am a full time college student.

Edit: Also I suppose I should ask should I use Cinnamon or Mate (with regards to hardware compatibility)? I really like Cinnamon but since Mate is based on Gnome 2 does it have better hardware support? Or does the Gnome 3 base for Cinnamon give similar or better support?

Edit 2: Also, if it is relevant should I be looking into LM or LMDE?"	t5_2ro56	True

Everything seems to be working, so I think I did it right, but I just want to double check with you guys and gals to make sure I set up the partitions correctly. I made a 20GB partition for the root / (I know that's big, but I was just making extra sure I had plenty of space). I made a 5GB partition for the swap, and I made the rest for /home. This is supposed to enable me to make clean installs later without losing my /home folder, right? I'll backup anyway before making any future installations, of course, but I think that's what I'm supposed to do, right? And when the time comes that I want to make a clean install of a newer version, what would that process be like? I'd boot the live DVD and choose install, right? Will it recognized that my /home and swap are on other partitions? What if I wanted to install a different distro? Would I still be able to keep my /home folder intact? 	t5_2ro56	True
