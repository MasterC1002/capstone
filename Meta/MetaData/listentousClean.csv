1344403701.0	xv8aj	Looks like we gained about a thousand subscribers today. Where'd you come from?	listentous	121	14	62	"Jeebus chreebus, it happened again!  Welcome to r/listentous, the best damn music subreddit out there!  We gained about thousand subscribers today *and just turned a year old* so this is a nice little present for us.  We also accept cash.

We're a lot like a democratic /r/listentothis. Every month, an election is held.  A post is made where a theme is announced and anyone can enter by posting 3 songs that fit the theme.  The top 5 entries as voted by the community (plus a wildcard picked by us mods) become our approved submitters for that month. The next one, as you can always find in the sidebar, starts Monday, August 27th and will run for 96 hours.  Voting is disabled for the first 48 of them and a second post will be made when voting is re-enabled. (This is our attempt to level the playing field so people around the world have time to enter without those entering first having an advantage.)

The elected are encouraged to only post a song a day. We don't care what it is as long it's music snob-worthy and gets marked with [genre] tags of the posters choosing. Posting corporate radio shit will get you warned once and then removed as a submitter.  That's not to say that listentous is a race to obscurity, it's a search for quality in the oceans we call music.

We're not kidding about being a place for music snobs.  Music elitism is welcomed, snobbery is embraced.  Think a posted track sucks?  Let the submitter know who did it better.  Be sure to include links so the community can decide if you're right or just a pompous jerk.  Remember this freedom to be a jackass only extends to music-- *personal attacks of any kind will get you banned without question*.

~~So where'd you'd all come from?  Did someone namecheck our little place?~~  Apparently long-time subscriber meemoza mentioned us in [a very popular /r/AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xufi3/i_can_hear_music_for_the_first_time_ever_what/c5pqdek?context=2).  Everyone, brace for impact!

Greetings music fans, and welcome to the end-of-year two-thousand-and-twelve best-of words-with-hyphens round-up!  Everyone knows that r/listentous is the *best damn music subreddit* whether or not that 'best' modifies music or subreddit is a subject of no small scholarly debate.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank our community!  Everyone who's ever been a submitter, entered an election, or even just taken the time to vote-- you are the ones who make this place what it is!  2012 has been a good year for r/listentous.  We've been twice [namechecked on forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2012/09/04/facebook-opts-for-a-mosh-pit-reddit-builds-an-idea-sanctuary/), featured as a [Subreddit of the Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/12nwwp/november_5_2012_rlistentous_democratically/), and seen the creation of [our very own subreddit radio player](/r/RedditRadio).

We were 3 months old when the year started, a [pretty quiet place with about 2,000 subscribers](http://i.imgur.com/GtHci.png).  Since then 4,500 more of you have discovered l2u, sometimes in [giant hordes that broke reddit](http://i.imgur.com/UuvVH.png), but usually a few new faces every day.  We certainly see [more traffic now than ever before](http://i.imgur.com/BQv3Z.png).

Without further ado, I'd like to present our 2012 ""top 3 submitters"" as chosen by our community!  These ~~lucky bastards~~ excellent contributors will all be receiving a month of reddit gold courtesy of the reddit [a]-team. 

*First place* -- /u/Terrorbutt (aka /u/hzford)	|	[radd.it playlist](http://radd.it/r/listentous/search?q=hzford+OR+terrorbutt&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)	|	[reddit posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/search?q=hzford+OR+terrorbutt&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

*Terrorbutt* tried to get away from his *hzford* roots, but just couldn't resist laying claim to all that fame.  His first place win is rightfully earned, just checkout his playlist for an education in rock, funk, blues and more from the 1960s on.  Terrorbutt was elected as a submitter three times for rounds 16, 17, and 20 (and only needs 2 more wins to become a mod.)

*Second place* -- /u/Rufuskthxbye	| 	[radd.it playlist](http://radd.it/r/listentous/search?q=Rufuskthxbye&amp;restrict_sr=on)	|	[reddit posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/search?q=Rufuskthxbye&amp;restrict_sr=on)

*Rufuskthxbye* was only elected once, but apparently made quite an impression.  Rufuskthxbye (thankfully) brought more modern musics to l2u, from electronic to instrumentals to singer-songwriter tracks.  Rufus was elected as a submitter for round 19.

*Third place* -- /u/qsert	|	[radd.it playlist](http://radd.it/r/listentous/search?q=qsert&amp;restrict_sr=on)	|	[reddit posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/search?q=qsert&amp;restrict_sr=on)

And finally, *qsert*, our reigning King of the Long-Play!  From rock to jazz to punk to classical to avant-garde, this man likes his discord and knows his shit.  And since he submitted it before the rule against such was made, he'll always hold the honor of having posted [the longest song in l2u history](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/127546/orthrelm_ov_metalavantgarde_2005/).

---

Not to be under-appreciated, our **best snobs of 2012**!  It was a cut-throat, too-close-to-call competition with two awards to be given and two users nominated.  /u/threefiveo125go ([playlist](http://radd.it/r/listentous/search?q=threefiveo125go&amp;restrict_sr=on)) has been a part of l2u for awhile now, and was elected as a submitter twice during rounds 13 and 14.  /u/Fuck_the_police ([playlist](http://radd.it/r/listentous/search?q=Fuck_the_police&amp;restrict_sr=on)) is a little newer to our subreddit but has also managed to get elected twice during rounds 18 and 20.  These guys help keep our elected submitters on their toes, our content quality high, and embody the spirit of listentous.  These two get a free month of reddit gold for their service!

I love music, it's the one consistent thing about my life.  Whatever may happen, I have always had and will always have music.  Maybe you feel similarly.

So I created /r/listentous for people like myself to take turns sharing the spotlight and the musics that make their world go around.  Are you one of those people?  Apply to be a submitter in the comments here.

Application is easy, it only requires three songs w/ working links.  You can post any three you like but I'd suggest using the following format:

Song #1 -- Something everyone likes.  You'll probably get more attention with a better-known track.

Song #2 -- Something everyone *should* like.  Maybe more obscure but a still easily-accessible track.

Song #3 -- Something you love but don't expect others to.  If you're truly a music snob in your heart, there's music you enjoy but hesitate to share.  Give us one.

Writing a bit about each song is probably a good idea as well.  Top 5 applicants by votes will become submitters.  Being a submitter lasts until the next round of voting.  You will be expected to post at least 4 songs a week but no more than 2 a day.  It will also be expected that you tag all your posts with a genre of your choosing.

Here we go!  (*And no one's.. gonna.. stop so now go!*)

edit: Changed ""top 10"" to ""top 5"" applicants.  Will go back up to 10 once the subreddit reaches a certain size.

This seems like a good time to inform/ remind everyone of what the hell is going on around here.

We're a lot like a democratic /r/listentothis.  Every three weeks, a post goes up starting an election for the top 5 submitters (plus a wildcard picked by the mod who ran the election.)  The next one, as you can always find in the sidebar, is *Monday, Nov. 14th*.  Elections run for 48 hours, voting is disabled for the first 24 of them and a second post is made when voting is re-enabled.  (This is our attempt to level the playing field so people around the world have time to enter without those entering first  having an advantage.)

The elected are encouraged to only post a song a day.  We don't care what it is as long it's music snob-worthy and gets marked with [genre] tags of the posters choosing.  Posting corporate radio shit will get you warned once and then removed as a submitter.

Being an elitist music snob is encouraged.  Correcting genre tags in comments is great. Telling others why their music sucks and who did it better is awesome.  Sharing that perfect song that you've loved all your life that not enough people know about is what this place is all about.  Personal attacks... will get you banned without question.

So again, welcome to r/listentous!  Now please tell us how the hell you found this place.

Okherewego!  This is the first election since our big influx of subscribers. so this should be a good test of our little experiment with democracy.  As always, many thanks to our round 16 submitters-- it's not glamourous work, but they bring us their favorite music everyday.

This election's theme is: *Animals*.  This [monkey's gone to heaven](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yHrEykOGpo).  I wanna [be your dog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I).  I am an [apeman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqd-EG8p64k).

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it *does* help catch the eye of your fellow voters. Posting more than three songs is fine, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond. In addition to your songs, *telling everyone a bit about your musical background* would probably help you too.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 48hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 48hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community (and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election) will become our approved submitters.  We only count the upvotes when determining winners, so downvoting your fellow entrants doesn't do anything. 

Since our little community has *doubled* in size since our last election, I feel this is a good time to expound on what  /r/listentous is about.  (Or aboot, if you're from Up North.)  We love music.  We love music to an obsessive ""*will you please shut up?*"" level.  We want to hear everything that's brilliant regardless of its style or origins.

It's been stated that we don't like ""corporate radio bullshit"".  This does not mean that r/listentous is a race to obscurity!  While we'd prefer submitters didn't post songs that everyone has [probably already heard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWgvGjAhvIw), we love [deeper cuts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4NAl460xYc) from [bands many of us already love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP4P786Au48).

That's it.  Welcome to the 1-year anniversary of our beginnings and the seventeenth election!

[INTRODUCING THE R/LISTENTOUS PLAYER](http://radd.it/listentous)!!  Oh man, it's neat.  Let's brag about the features!

* Playlists are customizable by genre, submitter, and year  
* Displays information about who you're listening to!  
* Album art!  
* You can upvote/ downvote from the player!  
* Reddit comments!

Additionally, you can start the player with a certain playlist already loaded.  Try a [random selection](http://radd.it/listentous?by=random), enjoy the [all hip-hop playlist](http://radd.it/listentous?by=keyword&amp;key=hip-hop), or listen to [everything submitted by fraKctured](http://radd.it/listentous?by=user&amp;key=fraKctured).


Not-so-obvious things about the player:

 * Clicking on a genre loads a playlist of that genre  
 * Clicking on the release year loads a playlist of that year    
 * Clicking on a users name (at the top of the reddit box) loads all their submissions  
 * Clicking on the current time display (top-left of the big play/ pause button) restarts the track  
 * Clicking on the song length display jumps the current position forward 10%  
 * Clicking on the speaker on the top-right ups the volume to 100%  
 * Clicking on the speaker w/ out the volume lines mutes the player

*Currently does not work in IE*.  Oh well.  This is the alpha version of the player, so there may be a few issues.  We've put a lot of work into this, so *pleasepleaseplease* let us know what you think or if you encounter any strange behaviours!"	t5_2sqe4	True

Welcome again to a /r/listentous election! It's a very special 20th edition that marks almost 6k subscribers, a neat [Radio](http://radd.it/listentous) and a sister [subreddit](/r/listentousagain).

The election's theme is about experiences you (usually) share: *[The Hot and Heavy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg49VOqWDq8)*. Songs that send [shivers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x50Ii95q4o4) down your spine, make [butterflies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQqV9POVEQ4) in your stomach or why not [all at once](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Lr2kRX0Qk).

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters. In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help you too.

Posting more than three songs is fine, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or providing alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 24hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one.

edit: Voting has begun!  So much excellent music!  Vote vote vote!

Greetings and welcome to the *sixth* [/r/listentous](/r/listentous) submitter election!  (No, I didn't add the link, [RES](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com) did because it's awesome.)  I'm very excited for this time around since we've had such an influx of new users since the last one.  A big thanks to our submitters, especially our current batch who've done an awesome job bringing us excellent and diverse musics.

I want to clear something up about when I say ""no corporate radio shit"".  This does *not* mean any music that's been on the radio isn't welcomed here. Talking Heads, Nirvana, Modest Mouse, three of my favorite bands, are on-air all the time.  There's even some ""grey area"" artists that I wouldn't complain about like Madonna, Marilyn Manson, or even Lady Gaga.  I'm talking about acts that are obviously more the product of marketing than talent.  I'm talking about music that was obviously crafted with potential profits in mind.  In my mind, [/r/listentous](/r/listentous) is about music will heart, music will soul.

One little caveat: I would prefer not to see songs posted that we've all heard a million times, no matter how awesome they may be.  There's been a few posts here that made me think ""who hasn't possibly heard that song?""  While I'm not interested in a race to obscurity, I would prefer that track you loved that didn't make it to the radio or that single that just didn't get the love it deserved.

OK!  Enough hoopla-ma-loopa, this elections theme is... *songs about guys*.  Yeah, I'm talking about ""Shaft"".  I'm talking about ""Jerry was a Racecar Driver"", he drove so goddamned fast.  I'm talking about the ""Leader of the Pack"" if you're a 90year-old woman with your hair up in curlers.

To enter, comment here with 3 songs that fit the theme.  The suggested format is one popular, one catchy, and one obscure track.  Please provide links to your songs (groveshark, youtube, soundcloud) and remember that a quick blurb about each track helps catch the eye (and thus the votes) of your fellow music snobs.

Please note that all voting is disabled for the first 24 hours.  When this post is 1 day old, voting will be re-enabled and a second post linking back here will be made.  When this post is 2 days old, the election will be over and top 5 submitters will be elected.  Elections occur once every 3 weeks.

Instead of our current overly-complex election process, we'll be simplifying everything by only electing a single submitter.  You read that that right too!  The Lone Submitter.  Kinda classy and romantic, yeah?

*But wait*, you may be thinking, *how is that listen to us?*  Fear not, you little independent-thinker you!  We Oligarchs will return to our submitter roots and be posting our favorite tracks too!

But the real excitement is that we have arranged with the reddit [a]-team and [Ear Candy Music Charity](http://www.earcandycharity.org/) to make l2u elections a change for good!  Instead of electing our lucky submitter with your cheap **vote**s, we'll instead be picking the entrant *who received the most reddit gold for their comment*.  Want someone to win? Make your opinion matter with [a few lone tasty bucks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilIDkkD0jIg).

To make up for the lack of submitters, the rules for the elected submitter have changed too!    To ensure diversity, the lone submitter for that round must:

* Post 8 tracks a day.  Every day.
* No corporate bullshit music
* No ""hits""
* No tracks from the same subsubgenre twice
* No tracks from official releases
* No tracks from recording sessions costing more than US$20k

If The Lone Submitter violates or fails to live up to any of these rules at any point during the tenure of their submittership, their status as that rounds submitter will be revoked.  In this case, the next scheduled election will be delayed 2 weeks from its original schedule date to allow for proper and respectful mourning.  In no way are the Oligarchs insinuating that *we'll send [a lone fucking hitman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYAGcoOymvo) to the homes of rejected submitters* because that would be taking things too far.

To help ensure quality, submitters may only post music from the following:

* The [Velvet Underground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjjDmX9Tkss)
* The Talking Heads
* The [Kraftverk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6235wlQ38w)
* The [Big Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP3ge9DGsKU)
* The [Leonard Cohen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otJY2HvW3Bw)
* The [Bauhaus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yur_mH_AXwQ)
* The Prince
* The [James Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWdY2t5U5iQ)
* The Vaselines
* The [They Might Be Giants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAmFTmCs3IY)
* The [Madonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M0b7wcKjJo ""And you can dance!"") (1980s only)
* The Talking Heads
* The [Michael Jackson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crbFmpezO4A)
* The [My Bloody Valentine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LseSx_hPJyQ)
* The [David Bowie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XrYs8gW2Vw)
* The [Mission of Burma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXkZI7WZWOo)
* The Melvins
* The [Pop Will Eat Itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCsBXSr4N-8)
* The Elvis Costello
* The [Sonic Youth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZiFZ8w_gE)
* The Talking Heads
* The [Sir Elton John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoskDZRLOCs)
* produced or recorded by The Steve Albini
* produced or recorded by The Quincy Jones
* anything The Dave Grohl has even considered working on
* Any tracks approved for use on any [Clearchannel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAibW7Jshbo)-owned radio subsidiary
* Any artist named in the The LCD Soundsystem song ""[Losing My Edge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk)""
* Any artist you *know* [an Oligarch likes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wp2qhoop9U)
* Did I mention The The Talking Heads?
* That shitty new artist some record exec bribed you to post
* Any artist submitter is directly related to and can provide nudes of
* Links to [radd.it which become recursive and destroy all computers everywhere](http://radd.it/1beiis)

And finally I'd like to say *lone* once more because television has taught me that repetition counts as humor.

Welcome to the 18th /r/listentous election and what promises to be a no-frills, by-the-book game between aliens and atomic supermen!  Are you new here?  I'm new here.  Lets be friends, hold hands, maybe even go steady.

The theme for this election is: MUSIC FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.  You get [no examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0QP4pdfK7w).  *[Go](http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Fatman/2E0URX)*.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters. In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help you too.

Posting more than three songs is fine, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or providing alternative links for those across the pond.   

Upvoting is disabled for the first **24hr** of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another **24hr** after which the top **7** commenters picked by the community (and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election) will become our approved submitters.  Unlike previous elections, **winners will not be determined by up-/down-votes**.  Details to come tomorrow.

Hello hello and welcome to the *twenty-first* r/listentous election!  It's an exciting time for our little subreddit!

First and foremost, [our little music player](http://radd.it/listentous) just turned two months old and has come a long, long way [from its humble origins](http://i.imgur.com/1K7cH.png).  There's even a [video-oriented version](http://radd.it/whoselineisitanyway) in the works!  Maybe I'm a little biased by the 1,000+ hours I've put into it, but I think it's turning out pretty damn swanky.  (Bonus: there'll be a new feature online by tomorrow that'll help browsing through election entries.)

*Secondly*, we're growing!  Growing all the time, at a rate of about 20 new subscribers a day with occasional 100-200 user 'bumps' when someone namechecks us elsewhere on reddit.  Thanks for being a part of l2u!  If you're hungry for more from our great submitters-past, be sure to check out our sister subreddit [r/listentousagain](/r/listentousagain)!

And finally we have our [best of 2012 nominations thread](http://redd.it/14ezaf) still going!  Is there a submitter you enjoy a bit more?  Nominate them to help them win free reddit gold!  Is there a song that was posted to our subreddit that just blew you away?  Nominate it so it gets included in our post to [r/bestof2012](/r/bestof2012)!

Alright then, enough of all that!  The theme for this month's election is... **water**.  Or more specifically [Bruce Lee's idea of water](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTnSEFsInp0).  You may interpret this theme literally.. if you're boring.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters. In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help you too.

reddit is a diverse place, but you know that already if you've found your way here. I've been reminded of this trying to find places to tell people about my site.  Sometimes I stumble upon what I can only describe as ""meathead asshattery"" but sometimes my findings take me to little communities filled with amazing outpourings of support.

One of these little communities is /r/AskTransgender-- and while I'm a dude in a dude's body, I've known enough LGBT people to understand some of the bullshit they face just trying to be themselves.  And that kind of social discomfort is certainly something I can relate to.

Which brings us to this elections theme: ***if I were a (wo)man***.  Gentlemen, what if you were not?  Ladies, what if you could let it all hang low?  Try not to be distracted by the suddenly-external parts of your body and get in touch with your respective inner [anima or animus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus).  Or, if you're so inclined, [get in touch with both](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQQ7nnm0cg4).  (Note: don't blare that video at work, someone screams ""faggot"" in the middle of it.  Then that someone get beaten the fuck down by a chick with a mustache, so that's cool.)

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: tradition recommends one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Please include years and genres with your songs! Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters.

#1) **The election will only run for 48 hours.**  The first 24 hours will be reserved for submitters to enter, voting will occur the second 24 hours.  *You've been warned.*

#2) Only the top 7 entrants (plus the wildcard) will become submitters.

George Harrison summed it all up so succinctly.  All things must pass.

r/listentous, I love you.  You've gone from a baby of a crazy idea to a acne-scarred teenager of the best damn music subreddit.  I feel I can say that with full humility as I've only played a very small part in making that happen.  Our submitters and our community are what make this place what it is.  I am proud of you, of what you've become.

But the time has come for me to step down and let the next wave of Oligarchs step up.  *Which makes these next few elections quite important*.  The people you're voting for today may just be your mods tomorrow.  We have several recurring submitters who are close to hitting that win-5-elections-become-a-mod jackpot.  (I may even make it win-4-and-wahoo if need-be.)

Why?  I'm busy with [radd.it](/r/radd_it).  *Hella*-busy.  It's gone from being a little something for this place to being the basket I've put all my eggs in.  I have more ideas than time, and I don't want l2u to suffer because of it.  

Which bring us to this elections theme: **passing the torch that consumes me**.  Like moths to the flame.  Like Icarus, yearning to feel the heat of the Sun on his skin once more.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: tradition recommends one popular, one catchy, and one obscure.

The 31st election, where you roll your own theme!	evilnight	30	4	100	"I've been wondering if selecting obscure music subreddits and odd genres and broad themes has been keeping participation down a bit, so we're going to try a little experiment this time and find out what happens.

This election, the tracks you submit can be any theme you desire, but they still do require some kind of theme. We're going to be judging folks not just on the tracks you submit but also on how creative your theme is. The tradition of having one popular track, one catchy track, and one obscure track is still in effect. The themes the moderators have chosen in previous elections are fine examples as well, feel free to revisit them if you want.

Since you are now in control of the theme, we think it's fair to ask for more than just three tracks this time. **Try for five tracks** that fit whatever creative theme you can come up with, and as many bonus tracks as you like. Think of these as miniature mixtapes.

Voting will begin *Thursday* around noon. We're giving you a little extra time to submit so you can be a bit more creative with the themes. We will pick the winners on Sunday. If you want examples of themed selections, there are plenty [here,](http://summermixseries.com/2009/) [here,](http://summermixseries.com/2010/) and [here.](http://summermixseries.com/) Remember - the most creative themes are the most likely to win this time!

Tell us about your theme and how each of your tracks plays into it for maximum effect!

Use this listening link to get the most out of this election with radd.it. It'll skip over the non-music links.

So, what is post-punk? No one really knows. Really. /u/weblypistol, a mod of /r/postpunk, has provided a [little playlist](http://www.playlist.com/playlist/23975848459#a/r_03/04k/) to get you in the post-punk spirit. The problem stems from the fact that once everyone saw this whole punk thing going down, they started incorporating many disparate genres of the time like synth-pop, disco, and funk, and it all got rolled into one large post-punk cigar.

So get out your synthesizers, your jangly guitars, your funky basslines and floor toms, and lets have a lil' post-punk party.

In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help ya too. But don't ask me, I just run these things.

Hello hello, and welcome to the very first election of the new format!  Who knows how well this will work? *Nobody*!  Who knows how much it'll change how elections play out?  *Nobody*!  Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of  men?  Nob-.. er, [*The Shadow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMlRpN8ANrU).

We're quite pleased to be featuring /r/vintageobscura this time!  It's a lovely little subreddit created and modded by /u/kaptain_carbon and his sidekick /u/DustBiter who will be inviting their subscribers to both come join the election and rain down judgement upon our confuddled l2u regulars.  Try to avoid what's already in that subreddits ""top"" and [keep it classy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHNnFj0TEo).

**edit**: /u/astarkey12 asked:

&gt; If /r/vintageobscura is already dedicated to obscure-only posts, shouldn't we do away with the tradition of ""one popular, one catchy, and one obscure""?

*Nope*.  Maybe we'll call it a life lesson in not doing things for the sake of tradition when it's not a good idea.

That's right, a top 9!  And our 17th wildcard submitter is *kthxl8r*.  This isn't so much my decision so much as him getting 10th in this election.  I just cannot pick from so many excellent submissions!  (If you're wondering why there's two point totals: to help prevent reddit's vote-obscuring from messing up our election results, the post is loaded twice and the points from both compared.)

Our sixteenth election!  /r/listentous is creeping up on it's first birthday!  As always, thanks for being a part of the best damn music subreddit.  Tell your friends!

This election's theme is: love songs of the unrequited, the inappropriate, the downright creepy.  Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be upvoting you.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter. Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond.  **In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about yourself and your musical background would probably help you too.**

Upvoting is disabled for the first 48hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 48hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election will become approved submitters."	t5_2sqe4	True

Yes, good morning, salutations, and welcome to the *nineteenth* /r/listentous submitter election!  There's alotta text below so let's jump right to...

This elections theme is: *Odd time signatures*.  And I mean that literally: all submitted songs must be in 3/4, 3/8, 7/8, or [some other uneven fraction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyX-Mjaq8Hk ""being Radiohead, this might actually be 4/4 that repeats the drum loop every other measure"").  As a bonus challenge, I'm going to go ahead and forbid any Zappa or Radiohead this election.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters. In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help you too.

Posting more than three songs is fine, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or providing alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 24hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 24hr after which the top 7 commenters picked by the community (and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election) will become our approved submitters.

*A little bird told me that r/listentous is going to be featured this week*.  Current submitters and those lucky winners of this election, now is a good time to share your pop-favorites.  Or your most obtuse, brilliant finds that more people would love if only they were not assholes.  Ya know, whatever.  (And yes, this entire paragraph is pointless but true, like most things.)

We're working on getting the [r/listentous player](http://radd.it/listentous) beta developed and hope to have it online sometime this week.  It kinda [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/R90Jc.png).

I. Submitters  
II. Oligarchs  
III. Posting Rules  
IV. Election Schedule  
V. Running an Election  
VI. When The Music's Over

***

**I.** ***Submitters***

Only 8 approved submitters shall exist at one time.  Seven of those submitters are picked by the community during monthly elections and the eighth chosen by the moderator who ran the election.

---

**II.** ***Oligarchs***

The moderators of /r/listentous are referred to as ""Oligarchs"".  Aside from the founder, all Oligarchs have been elected submitters in previous elections.

---

**III.** ***Posting Rules***

* No corporate radio bullshit.

If you can't tell the difference between an *artist* and a *profit-driven corporate shill*, you're in the wrong subreddit.  What qualifies as corporate radio bullshit is left solely to the discretion of the Oligarchs.  

Here's a quick test:  Name a musician with the initials of JB.  Did you pick James Brown or Jeff Buckley?  You're in the right place.  Did you pick Jimmy Buffet or The Antichrist?  Go away.

* No ""hits"".

This is a very ""loose"" rule-- but if we've all heard it before, find something less known.

* No tracks over 28 minutes.

/r/listentous tries to share the spotlight evenly across all our submitters.  Full albums and performances, or exceptionally-long pieces monopolize too much of our subscribers time.  Find the track (or section) that you really love and share that instead.

* Format your titles.  Include genres and year release when possible.

The ideal formatting is: Artist Name -- Song Name [genre/ genre] (year) *whatever else you may want to add*

A little extra text at the end is fine, but don't go too crazy.

---

**IV.** ***Election Schedule***

Elections tend to occur on the 3rd Monday of every month.  This is subject to change due to major US holidays or the schedule of the Oligarch running the election.  (And sometimes I just forget.)

Election dates should always be mentioned in the sidebar roughly a month ahead of time.

---

**IV.** ***Running an Election***

Running elections have become simple thanks to contest mode!

Step #0) Make a new text post

Step #1) Open the previous election (link in sidebar) in a new tab

Step #2) Copy the verbiage that doesn't change (how to enter, etc.) and paste it into your new post.

Step #3) Say hello to the lovely people.  Make up a theme or check the ""possible themes"" modmail.

Step #4) Save the post.  Copy the URL.

Step #5) Edit the post.  Spam the hell out of my site.

* Replace the 'www.reddit.com' with 'radd.it' to make the instant-playlist link
* Append ?only=music&amp;sort=author at the end to only get songs and alphabetize the entries.

Step #6) Enable contest mode!

Step #7) *distinguish* the post so it gets the [M] tag.

Step #8) Update the sidebar with a nice **bold** link to the election.

* **After 24 hours, make a second post linking back to the new election post.**

Step #9) Edit the new election post to announce that voting has begun.  Include a handy \*\*vote\*\* for the huddled masses.

Step #10) After another 48 hours (making 72 hours, or 3 days total running time for the election), edit the post again announcing that the election has ended.

---

**IV.** ***When the Music's Over***

Step #0) Turn off the lights.

Step #1) Make a new text post.

Step #2) Determine the top 7 submitters by counting ""vote"" comments.

**The profile of every account that votes should be checked.**

 * If the account is active and over a month old, count that vote.  That user should be given ""voter"" flair to establish their profile has been checked.
 * If the account is new, suspicious, or obviously for porn, don't count that vote.  This is the sole discretion of the mod running the election.

**In the case of ties...**

Ties for 7th happen in *every* election.  To pick which submitters get elected, votes from previous submitters count once *for every time they have been elected*.  If they've been elected 3 times, their vote counts three times as well.  Votes from Oligarchs do *not* count extra. 

Other potential super-tiebreakers may be used: like upvotes, writing ability, or just whoever you like best.  Super-tiebreakers are the sole discretion of the mod running the election.

Step #3) Pick a wildcard.

* Determine a second vote ""count"" solely from previously-elected submitters

* Votes from the previously-elected count once for each election that submitter has won

* Wildcards can *not* be previously elected (or wildcarded) submitters.

* Ties for wildcards are up to the sole discretion of the mod running the election.

Step #4) Update your new post with the new submitters.

Step #5) Open the ""edit approved submitters"" in a new tab.

Step #6) Remove the previous submitters, regardless if they were re-elected.

Step #7) Add the new submitters.  This will notify them that they won.

Step #8) Open the old ""our current submitters"" link in a new tab (you'll want it for #10)

Step #9) Update the sidebar

* Link to your new post under ""Our current submitters!""  
* Link back to the latest election
* Update the date of the next election.

Step #10) Add all removed submitters to r/listentousagain

Do you feel it, dear reader?  The wave of fate sweeping us along?  Sometimes I feel on top of that wave, sometimes down below.

*Round 22*.  [**Entropy**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUVIS4ddtpg).  The tendency of [order towards chaos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MXgZk-yBBw).  And so we [call upon the author to explain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyGivD8aJi4).

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: tradition recommends one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters.  /u/Fuck_the_police would like for you to include years and genres with your songs.

In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help ya too.  Don't ask me, I just run these things.

You have 24hrs from the time this post was made to enter.  Voting begins after those 24 hours; a second post will be made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 24hr after which the top 7 commenters picked by the community (and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election) will become our approved submitters.

Contest mode is enabled!  Yay for contest mode.

Remember, everyone who votes get flair indicating that they are a voter. Voter flair causes non-flair holders to tremble with fear in the presence of your words. True story.
Voting ends in 24 hours!

It's that time of year again!  

Er, wait, we've never done this before.. it's that time of year!  Our first (of hopefully many) bestof election!  Oh, *so* special!  We'll be voting on *Best Submitter* here, please check the other post to vote for best tracks posted in 2012!  And remember, **our top 3 submitters win reddit gold** so be sure to back your favorites!  Like our normal elections, *you're welcome to vote as many times as you like*.  Someone you especially don't like?  Vote for everyone else!

Voting for this election works just like our regular elections, minus the federally-mandated 24-hour waiting period.  You'll see comments from yours truly, **reply to a comment with \*\*vote\*\* to vote** for that submitter!  *All votes in this thread will be removed* to help keep things anonymous and suspenseful!  This election will run 96 hours!

You may be thinking: *Now wait a Hollywood minute, what about best snob?  And what's a Hollywood minute?  Sounds like a segment on Entertainment Tonight.  Oh, yeah, I have that thing tonight.  Do I need to buy more duct tape for that or will Philipe have enough?  What was I thinking about?  Oh, right, best snob for r/listentous!  Maybe I need those ADHD meds again.*  If so, there might be something wrong with you and I'd like to hear more about your evening plans.

Well, we had two prizes to hand out.. and two users nominated!  And I think we can all agree that /u/threefiveo125go and /u/Fuck_the_police both deserve the title!  So congrats on a hard-fought victory there.  It's [round 5 all over again](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/ls5vd/round_5_election_winners/)!

**edit**: Last time, we didn't use karma for voting and I noticed that the entire thread had a total of 2 downvotes.  Before, most threads would have dozens of downvotes.  This makes me think that reddit doesn't ""fuzzy"" up the votes very much-- *so this election will only be counting upvotes*.

Hello and yada yada yada... the tenth [/r/listentous](/r/listentous) submitter election!  It's been 6 month since our crazy little experiment of a subreddit started and we're up to 1,700 music snobs.  A big thanks to all of you who've helped make listentous what it is!  Watching [l2utv](http://reddit.tv/#/r/listentous) is a big part of how I listen to music these days. 

This elections theme is: *the finest worksong*.  Music you listen to when you have to get something done, music that makes your tasks go by.

To enter, simply comment below with *three* songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure.  Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter.  Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to.  Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 24hr of the election to help balance the playing field.  After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one.  Voting lasts another 24hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election will become approved submitters."	t5_2sqe4	True

These bands were the forebears of metal and stoner rock, making use of distortion, heavy riffs, and walls of sound. See [juqjoint's description for more details.](http://www.reddit.com/r/monsterfuzz/comments/13el58/what_is_monsterfuzz_and_where_does_it_come_from/) Examples of this kind of music are...

* [Budgie - Breadfan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5IxDxm_MIE) 1973 
* [Flower Travelin' Band - Satori](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5mMLbF3ts4) 1971
* [Uriah Heep - Look At Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPIK9wUXogo) 1971

The kind folks over at /r/monsterfuzz will be dropping by to share their finds with us during this election. You all know the rules by now, but here's a quick recap for any newcomers.

* Submit three tracks of your choice: One popular, one catchy, and one obscure.
* It helps to tell us a little bit about the track and the band.
* Make them great, this is about *quality* over quantity. ;)
* Submit as many other bonus tracks as you like.

Instead, just a quick bit to let everyone know we have a new rule for submitters: *no songs over 20 minutes*.  One of the core concepts behind /r/listentous is to keep the amount of music being posted here to a level that allows our subscribers the opportunity to actually hear it all.  We mods feel that obscenely long tracks force everyone to make a decision: listen to that track or listen to everything else that has been posted that day.

While this rule affects some of our submitters (and certain genre-lovers) more than others, I think 20 minutes is more than enough time for a song to express itself.  Effective immediately, any posts made that violate this rule will be quietly removed.

---

edit: A little backlash to this annoucement, but I think [meemoza](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentous/comments/12ag24/anncmnt_new_submitter_rule_no_tracks_over_20/c6tugki) expressed our intentions the best:

&gt; This rule does exclude plenty of songs, but every one of those artists has enough good tracks to be shared that fit in 20 minutes. The idea behind this is to have more diversity in a shorter span of time, which works well if you use the new player, but of course, you can always skip songs you don't want to listen, it's just a small hassle.

&gt;Perhaps we could allow songs that are a bit longer, but I don't think people should post full hour albums and 2 hour ambient tracks (especially if it happens often), even though they might be beautiful, there are subreddits that specialize in that, such as /r/highfidelity.

---

**edit**: Not a lot of entries, most likely due to a rather difficult theme, but some excellent choices all around!  Should be a good month for listentous regardless of who wins!

---

Greetings and welcome to the twelfth listentous election!  Every time I post an election, I'm amazed we've made it this far.  I'm writing this with a slightly-wounded hand, so pity me.

You may have noticed that election periods have become longer.  Now submitters are being kept for about a month, so vote wisely!  Since most of the downvotes seem to have vanished since changing the policy, we will be once again only counting upvotes on submissions.

I'm working with one of the current submitters to create a not-quite-ready new sister subreddit to listentous.  It should be up before our next election, stay tuned!

**This rounds theme is...** music with voices but no words.  We're looking for songs that break away from traditional singing or use of lyrics.  The nonsensical or the simply noise.  The first example that comes to mind is Brian Eno's ""[Here Come the Warm Jets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6r7Nwii4zc)"".  I also feel compelled to subject everyone to [this cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEJvHUHIs3A).

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter. Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 24hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 24hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election will become approved submitters."	t5_2sqe4	True

*****

Welcome to the second election under our new format featuring /r/electrohiphop. Before we dive into this election, I would like to clear up any possible confusion about how we define electro hip-hop over in the sub. 

True electro hip-hop would be something like [Afrika Bambaata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh1AypBaIEk), but since that’s such a limited definition and wasn’t exactly what we were looking to find more of in creating the subreddit, we employ a much broader interpretation of the term. For the sake of this election (and the general rule of the sub), electro hip-hop is defined as **electronic music with discernable hip-hop influences (808s, rap vocal samples, etc.) that is generally more uptempo**. Ok, there. I said it. Hopefully, it’s not as narrowly defined as you imagined and my explanation dispelled any misconceptions. On to more important things.

As part of this month’s election festivities, we are bringing you something special: **an AMA with electro hip-hop, funk, soul duo [Archnemesis](http://tothebestof.com/archnemesis)** (exact date and time to be confirmed - **tentatively May 8th**, but future announcements will be made to keep you in the loop).  Hopefully, the AMA will give you more insight about this type of music if it was something you previously weren’t interested in. 

Now, the schpiel. To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that would fit the subreddit: tradition recommends one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Please include years and genres with your songs! Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters.

In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help as well, although that is no guarantee. 
You have **24hrs from the time this post was made to enter**. Voting begins after those 24 hours; a second post will be made linking back to this one. **Voting lasts 72hrs** after which the top 4 entrants picked by the community (and one wildcard) will become our approved submitters.

Contest mode is enabled! 

(Feedback on the new election format should be posted in the thread announcing the winners of this election. Also, thank you to /u/listentous for giving me the opportunity to supervise what I hope will be an enlightening month of music!)

Our supreme overlords that are the reddit admins have announced that they're doing the [best-of 2012](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012) a little differently this year.  In addition to giving out awards, they've asked the communities to put together their own best-of lists.  They're even giving each subreddit 5 credits for a month of reddit gold to be given out to users picked by that community!  (There's also a [community-driven best-of 2012](http://www.reddit.com/r/truebestof2012/comments/14e8d5/nomination_best_little_community/ ""HINT, HINT"") as well.)

r/listentous, being the best damn music subreddit, needs not only to be represented but to show off the best of the best that we've seen.  We'll be having three categories:

**&gt; &gt; TOP TRACKS**  

The top 10 tracks as picked by the community.  Instead of just pulling from our [all-time top-scoring posts](/r/listentous/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all ""not a bad place to start tho""), **songs need to be nominated here**.  Is there a track that really struck you?  Something that exposed you to an artist or genre and inspired you to find more?  *Nominate it*!  Nominated tracks will be voted on by the community in a future post.

**&gt; &gt; TOP SUBMITTERS**

The top 3 submitters as picked by the community *will be awarded reddit gold* and received special ""I'm a bad-ass 2012"" flair.  Like with songs, **submitters need to be nominated here** to be considered.  (And sorry folks, you can't nominate yourself.)  Nominated submitters will be voted on by the community in a second future post.

**&gt; &gt; TOP SNOBS**

Who best represents the spirit of listentous?  Who's not shy about telling submitters that their genre tags are wrong?  That their post isn't up to our expectations?  Who are the users who keep our elected submitters on their toes?  The top 2 snobs as picked by the community *will be awarded reddit gold* and special flair indicating ~~that they're a jerk~~ their contribution to l2u.  Again, **snobs need to be nominated here** and will be voted on by the community in a future post.  (Same election post as for top submitters.)  

Notes:

* These will be special elections held mid-December in addition to our regular election.  
* All posts and submitters *since the start of the subreddit* are eligible.  We were &lt;6months old at the end of 2011.  
* Users can be nominated for both categories but cannot win in both.  In the case of someone placing in the top 3/ top 2 in both categories, that user will get to pick which they want and the other handed down to the 4th (or 3rd) place winner.  
* You look nice today.  You should do that with your hair more often.

Hello and welcome to the *ninth* [/r/listentous](/r/listentous) submitter election!  We're a little delayed due to the SOPA protests, but before we've been this delayed for no reason at all so that's ok.  And here we go!

This elections theme is: Music for a late night.  It's 2am, dark outside, and you're wearing headphones as to not disturb them sleeping.  Maybe you didn't have the best day.  Maybe you had the best day ever.  What are you listening to?

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter. Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or providing alternative links for those across the pond.

**Voting will be handled differently this time**, so feel free to upvote away.  After 24hr, a second post will be made linking back to this one and details on how to vote will be given.

*edit*: I've only tested this in Chrome, but if you paste the following into your address/ omnibar, it should turn all youtube links into clickable embeds so you can just click 'em for the video to pop up.

So if you are a student or a teacher, you understand that Summer is almost over. If you are anyone else who has to work 12 months out of the year and despise students and teachers that get to just read fantasy novels during the hot portion of the year, you realize that summer extends until mid September. Summer is almost over. To commemorate this passing, **the theme of this selection is Summer Jams**. Be it 2013, older summers, or just music good for catching up on old episodes of Dark Shadows while your friends toil away in the heat, let us celebrate music made for jamming in shorts and drinking at irresponsible hours. 

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme: one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of your fellow voters. In addition to your songs, telling everyone a bit about your musical background and why you'd make a good submitter would probably help you too.


Posting more than three songs is fine, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or providing alternative links for those across the pond.

There was some talk among the mods during the election about what constitutes a valid account for voting.  We've decided to help prevent voter fraud, we're going to ~~need your bank card and PIN~~ require the following from the account in order for its votes to be counted:

* ..be at least 3 months old.  
* ..email verified with reddit.  
* ..submitted/ commented on *something* in a non-NSFW subreddit.  
* ..have positive post/ comment karma.  

If you cannot meet these criteria but would still like to vote, you are welcome to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flistentous) and explain your situation.  The above are just guidelines, we mods reserve the right to allow or deny voters on a user-by-user basis.

Somehow, you all forgot to upvote my entry enough for *me* to make the list.  You jerks.

**albatro55** -- he likes the indie rock  
**prophet178** -- another indie rocker  
**darwins_bitch** -- any fan of Talking Heads is a fan of mine  
**Mogart** -- all over the rock genre  
**HBtC** -- squeaking in with some more indie rock

And our first *wildcard* submitter, **I_hold_the_handle**,  Yeah, I gave it to the dude with the most downvotes.  I got a weak spot for grumpy uncles.

                                                 RULES FOR SUBMITTERS

Finding music on the internets is about as difficult as finding boobies.  What separates /r/listentous from other subreddits is that we are far more interested in *quality* over quantity.  Please keep in mind that all rules are an attempt to achieve as high of a signal: noise ratio as possible.

**Rule #1** -- Submitters should not post more than 1 song a day.

**Rule #2** -- Submitters are expected to post at least 3 times a week.

**Rule #3** -- All posts should be [tagged] with a genre of the submitter's choice.  Debate about the accuracy of the genre tag is encouraged.  A list of quicklinks will later be added to the sidebar.

**Rule #4** -- Submitters are encouraged (but not required) to leave a comment with their post about the music or what the song means to them.

**Rule #5** -- Submitters will be elected every 15 days.   The top 5 commenters based on votes will become the next submitters.   Anyone may enter, regardless of past winnings. 

**Rule #6** -- Ties in elections shall be won by whomever applied *most recently* in the post.

**Rule #7** -- I reserve the right to pick one wildcard submitter per election.

**Rule #8** -- All elected submitters receive flair text to keep and hold forever and ever.  Not requesting specific flair text is an agreement on your part to accept whatever wackiness I give you.

**Rule #9** -- Submitters will lose all current and future posting privileges if they flood the subreddit, abuse the rules, or act with any sort of excessive asshattery.  I'm an easy-going guy, but my banhammer is mighty.

We haven't figured out *all* the details about the new election formats, but there are a few changes that we Oligarchs are agreed upon:

* Elections will no longer have ""themes"" but instead feature another music-related subreddit

Ya know, /r/SoundsVintage, /r/electrohiphop, /r/vintageobscura, /r/riotgrrrl, or any generally genre-centric subreddits.  Instead of posting music to fit a theme, we'll be looking for music that would fit in the subreddit.  (And we'll be *heavily-frowning* upon anyone posting tracks from that subreddits *Top* page.)

Run a music subreddit or have one you really love?  [Suggest it in modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flistentous&amp;subject=electionsubreddit).

* Elections will be semi-monthly. 

On the 1st and 3rd Monday of every month.  (Note: this months has been moved to the 15th.)

* Elections will last 4 days.

24 hours to enter, another 3 days to listen and vote.

* Top 4 submitters+ 1 wildcard each election become submitters

Submitters will continue being submitters for *a full month* and are ineligible to run in elections until that month is up.

* Submitters may only post 5 times a week.

No more one-post-per-24-hours rule.  Submitters will be trusted to submit their posts as they see fit-- up to 5 songs a week.

Fifteen.  Everyone knows that it's 3 times 5, but few seem to realize its true meaning: 555, the number of ~~the beast~~ fake phone numbers!

Which indirectly brings us to this elections theme: *communication and community*.  Billy, don't you lose my number.

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter. Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 48hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 48hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election will become approved submitters."	t5_2sqe4	True

edit: Voting has begun!  Go listen and vote!  Winners will be determined by upvotes, downvotes are ignored.

Election number thirteen.  It aint your lucky number.

This elections theme is: music for robbing banks.  Sweat stings your eyes, the plan is in motion.  What's playing when Hollywood glamorizes your story?  Survival of the fittest, Max, and [we've got the fucking gun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyMlE3nsIyw).

To enter, simply comment below with three songs with working links that fit the theme-- one popular, one catchy, and one obscure. Writing blurbs about the songs isn't required but it does help catch the eye of the voter. Posting more than three songs is allowed, but too many will leave users unsure of which ones to listen to. Try to use sources that are available worldwide or alternative links for those across the pond.

Upvoting is disabled for the first 24hr of the election to help balance the playing field. After that period, voting will be enabled and a second post made linking back to this one. Voting lasts another 24hr after which the top 5 commenters picked by the community and one wildcard picked by the mod running the election will become approved submitters.

edit: I forgot to disable upvotes for the first 12 hours-- and yet only one extra vote was cast!  Thanks for being a cool community, regular voting will be back tomorrow."	t5_2sqe4	True
