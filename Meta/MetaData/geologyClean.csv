Now I know I'm not the only single female geology student to keep her rock hammer next to her bed - in fact I know several ladies in my class that also do this. But I had always wondered how I'd react if I ever felt the need to actually use my rock hammer on someone.  I can now be confidant that 3 years of bashing rocks has well prepared me to absolutely destroy someone that I deem a threat to my safety.

How do I know? Well it turns out that my roommate left our front door unlocked by mistake when she left for Easter break earlier today. I forgot to check it was locked before going to bed since I NEVER use that door. So flash forward to 1am when a drunk college kid wakes me up in the middle of the night - BY OPENING MY BEDROOM DOOR. 

Needless to say I went from sleeping to level 9000 hard-core bashing-mode in less than a second. I didn't even think about it but my rock hammer was literally the first thing in my hand. And I was SO ready to use it if I had to.

Luckily, it didn't come to that. I didn't get a good look but it seems he was just a drunk college kid that had wandered into the wrong house. When he woke me up I shouted ""Who the fuck is that?"" as I grabbed my hammer. He responded with a quick ""sorry"" before basically fleeing the scene. Nothing was stolen, I'm fine other than being a little freaked out. Called the police for good measure but otherwise I'm just about to go back to sleep now.

TL;DR: keep your rock hammer nearby and practice bashing rocks as much as possible. Gotta say it feels good to know that I'm capable of causing serious damage if I need to..."	t5_2qshr	True

1321383492.0	mddaj	How to become a funded geology grad student.	txexpat	79	8	34	"Don't sweat the small stuff. And you would be surprised what constitutes the small stuff. In order from least important to most:

GRE: Assuming it meets the minimum requirements, doesn't matter.

GPA: Assuming it meets the minimum requirements, doesn't matter. Make sure you did well in specific classes that which pertain to what you want to be when you grow up. (ie. Stratigraphy:Stratigrapher)

Statement: This is to make sure you are not an illiterate sociopath. Tell them you look geology bunches, and it revs your engine. Cater to specific professor. (see below)

Letters of Rec: CRUCIAL. These will make or break you. Ive seen masters students with a fist-full of letters and so-so grades get fully funded with tuition, fellowships, grants, scholarships, and research stipends (me, and others I know)

MAKE CONTACT WITH INDIVIDUAL PROFESSORS. Trickier than it sounds. Go on Ebsco/georef, google scholar, etc... Type in your favoritest! part of geology. Narrow your results to within the past 4 years. Find someone at a school you could stand being at who does something you like. Most people wander into a masters program based on the school. You will be much happier in the long run if you base it on an individual professor. This person will become your graduate advisor and can make you're life a cakewalk or a hell.

MAKE CONTACT! You would be shocked how much ahead you can get if you just email people from the list you've now made. This is the tricky part. These emails will need to contain some flattery, however if you are interested in the things they are publishing about, this should not be a problem. If you have to pretend to like their work, you may want to choose another professor. Also, because of the nature of flattery, you can really only choose 1 professor per college to send such an email to. You will look like a horses ass sending multiple ""you're awesome"" emails within 1 department. That's why this is based on individual professors, not schools.

Some things to base your choice of professor loosely on (These are not always true, obviously. But generally are.) Experience:

0-2yrs: Probably doesn't have much money or tenure. He/She may go away/lose funding before your thesis is done (seen it happen, sucks). But they are also out to make a name for themselves in the research world as well as get tenure, so a good one can take you far.

3-10yrs: The sweet spot. Have ""acclimatized"" to teaching and are far less volatile than the less experienced. Usually have tenure and strong ability to secure grants and other research money. They are probably pretty firm in their field vs lab research mentality and you can tell by their data collection methods if you will be an outdoor or indoor cat for 2 years (pack mule/lab monkey). Both of which can be satisfying depending on what you're in to.

11-20yrs. The time to ""make a name"" has passed and they either did it or didn't. Reflected in which will be their ability to raise money, have time for research as opposed to teaching, or generally give a shit about you. However, you are not going to shock these people. They have seen it all.

21-30yrs: They are in it for the department at this point. They don't want to put their name on a shitty thesis, but they probably aren't gonna grind you to get things done, because frankly, it only effects you in the end. Probably don't do a ton of research anymore and have limited funding/need for grad students. Flattery email goes furthest with this group.

30+yrs: Dude, unless they are famous or something, you're fucking up.

Cross-reference anyone you choose with ""ratemyprof"" type sites and remember most people who write to those are the pissed off failures (ie. The one calling the professor a fucktard [although some professors are in fact fucktards so be on the lookout for that too])

Most professors will respond to your email. If they look like they are not an asshole write back and ask specifically about upcoming projects, research assistance, and funding. If they like you, they will be very forthcoming, if not they will give you bullshit. Having an advisor that wants you to be their grad student will take you farther in your academic career than anything else. They will get you in. Period.

I had a few questions about getting into grad schools and this was the response. I have edited it to keep the authors id anonymous.

Hello!

Thanks for the email- these are excellent questions to be asking, but unfortunately the only right answer to all of them is ""It depends...""


As a warning this ends up being a pretty verbose email...

As an executive summary, I would say the most important parts of the process are (1) being honest with yourself about what you are willing to do and where you are willing to go (2) visualizing what you want to accomplish during the M.S. experience so that you can pick a suitable place and advisor, (3) having a goal that the M.S. degree will facilitate, and thus picking the right place for that
 

Geology is a pretty broad based field (not unlike medicine) and there are thus a number of different careers that can be pursued with various levels of university training.  Most all professional jobs require a Masters for new hires, although most of the workforce veterans are doing their jobs with Bachelor degrees.

Hands down, the highest paying jobs in geology are in the oil and gas industry- however, one doesn't need to specialize in oil and gas geology for their M.S. to land one of these jobs.  Conversely, it may in fact be counterproductive to a career to do so.  The industry's model for new hire geologists is that the first 2-3 years (after graduate school) are spent training an employee on how to do their job.  From what I have experienced, prospective employers in the oil and gas industry are most interested in candidates who they feel are ""integrative thinkers"" about geology.  They are keen on a potential employee who has a multi-faceted background, and has demonstrated the ability to take on a project and work on a nominally independent basis to produce some results that they can succinctly and convincingly report.  The easiest way to demonstrate this to a prospective employer is by taking a handful of graduate level classes (this is usually a requirement of an M.S. degree regardless) and producing a body of supervised research as part of a thesis.  As an example of how little the topic matters, my M.S. thesis was on XXXXX in Alaska, but I gave a 20 minute presentation on it as part of a job interview for a natural gas exploration company in Arkansas and was immediately offered the job.  The employer was more interested in the fact that I had been committed to solving geologic problems in pursuing the thesis than in what I knew about certain types of rocks.

I believe if you follow this model of getting a broad base from coursework and finding a project that is interesting, you will be set up for success for whatever endeavor you desire after school.  However, getting into graduate school is a somewhat competitive and uncertain process.  Additionally, at many schools there is a sliding scale of how much funding is awarded to incoming graduate students.  Some fellowships may be available that pay more than the regular graduate student stipend, whereas other schools may offer meager (what I would deem unsuitable) support packages.

For geology, no one should have to pay their own way for an M.S. degree.  There are various ways this works out- some schools offer a stipend but bill you for tuition (thus you pay out of the stipend- this actually has some tax benefits).  Other schools just waive tuition.  Where I did my M.S. they offered a waiver on out-of-state tuition to the in-state level, and then paid a meager (but livable) stipend out of which I paid my tuition.  Usually there is a health insurance plan that is offered by the university that may be partially subsidized by the graduate school.

So, it is important to try to be as competitive as possible in applying, because ultimately your admission, and the level of support, is solely judged by the attractiveness of your application package.

Having good grades is a great asset for the process, but probably more important is having good letters of recommendation from faculty.  I believe most schools ask for at least two letters of recommendation with the application.  For getting into graduate school, I would recommend at least two of the letters come from professors at USA, and then if there has been an employer for summer work, internships, etc..., that would be a good source of a third letter.  You can be a bit strategic with letters as well.  A big reason I am at XXXXXX now is that all three of my letters in my application came from former XXXXXX students (one from the 1970's one from the 80's, one from the 90's) who are now professors elsewhere and are people I have close working and personal relationships with.

Most applications also require a personal statement.  What makes the statement easy to write is having an idea of what you want to do academically- but that is not necessary.  I think people who don't spend a lot of time on the personal statement end up getting dropped in the rankings.  The harsh reality is that every geologist who is on an admissions committee has been required to publish at some point in their career to get tenured.  Therefore they hold the ability to communicate in writing in very high regard.  As an applicant, you must realize that they read a lot of these letters.  A verbose description of your resume is not near as appealing as a letter that tells a story.  Ultimately the story needs to be about you- and why they would be foolish not to have you, rather than all these other seemingly qualified applicants.

So, I picked where I wanted to go to do my M.S. on three criteria.  First, I wanted to be somewhere that the weather was good and the cost of living was low.  Second, I wanted to be able to do a thesis project in a somewhat exotic and mountainous location.  And, third, I wanted to learn more about one subdiscipline of geology called structural geology, because I hadn't gotten a good background on it in my undergrad but it was a field that I found interesting.  I ended up going through lots of departments and contacted lots of people.  Some professors had opportunities for prospective students listed on their webpages whereas others had webpages that hadn't been updated in several years.  I ended up making a choice that worked out well for me, but it turns out, what I got out of the experience was not what I expected.  I did my M.S. at XXXXXXX.  While I was there, I bought a house and rented out two of the rooms to gals who were students.  I did my thesis work on the XXXXX in Alaska.  I got to spend a most helping out a few of my classmates on their field sites in the Outback of South Australia.  I finished my M.S. degree without a dime of debt, but lived fairly frugally and worked the last summer, as I was finishing up.  

The most important thing I did in this process though was to make contacts before applying.  That served several purposes.  I was able to visit the school I was interested in at the school's expense.  I had a project lined up for when I came to school and actually did one month of field work before I started school.  Thus I had a head start on my research my first year and was able to finish in two years.
        

This website has links to every Geoscience department in the U.S. and Canada.  I literally went through the entire list of places that interested me. 

http://orgs.usd.edu/esci/geodepts.html


So, I got a lot out of my M.S. experience from the fact that the school did not offer a phd.  Schools that offer the phd may unintentionally treat M.S. students as second class citizens because by the time you train them, they are gone, thus a lot more efforts get put towards the phd students who will spent a couple years producing research after the training portion of their degree has been finished.  On the flipside, a school like the University of Arizona is next to impossible to get into for a phd, but and many of the student I know who are doing phd's there got into the program as M.S. students then switched.  it all depends on if a phd is something that is interesting.  If you are interested in going to somewhere like south africa,  nepal or antarctica for graduate research, a phd makes more sense because there is going to be a lot involved.  But that I suppose is an entirely different question that wasn't necessarily asked...


Some schools are very geared towards turning out people who will go into industry.  This is especially true in places that have oil and gas booms ongoing (e.g. University of Arkansas, West Virginia University).  This pretty much will guarantee a job, but might limit the breadth of the M.S. experience.

If I had to do an M.S. over again, I think I would look at UC-Davis, Wyoming, UTEP, Northern Arizona University, Oregon State, Univ. of Arizona, UT-Austin, South Carolina, Auburn, Western Washington University, Central Washington University, Washington State University, Montana, Montana State.  I am somewhat partial to western schools because I think field based learning is critical.

One curveball, if you son is good at/enjoys math, an M.S. degree in geophysics is a great option as well.  At least going to a school that had a strong program in both geology and geophysics should be a consideration if he is interested in industry jobs.  


As for the endgame...  All the good oil and gas industry jobs are pretty much all in Houston.  There used to be more opportunity for expat work, but the internet has allowed things to be a bit more centralized than in the past.  There are jobs outside of Houston, but they are more competitive and are held in lower esteem.  I know several people who have gotten jobs in the mining industry.  Unlike oil and gas, they seem to require a bit more of a specialized background or at least an internship. Which leads to a side note- the M.S. degree is a great time to do one (or several) internships within industry.  They actually pay the same as the career positions, give the student an opportunity to experience a company's culture, and look good on the resume because they are indeed good diversifying experiences.

If industry is not the direction (I ended up working a little over a year in industry after my M.S. and then went back for the phd), academia, government and the environmental/engineering sector all offer career opportunities.  academia and government research scientist jobs generally require a PhD and some postdoc experience.  This job market is pretty decent right now as a lot of geologists are at retirement age, but it is also highly competitive.  As an example, I have a friend who did his B.S. at XXXXX, PhD at XXXXX, and is 1.5 years into a postdoc at XXXXX and has yet to be offered a full time position.  These research intensive jobs offer the most freedom in terms of what one does on a day to day basis (the only requirement is to be able to get your work funded), but where you work is up to what place has a position open that you qualify for. 

Environmental/engineering jobs I believe can be had with a B.S., but an M.S. would be a huge advantage.  These are job usually dealing with code compliance, pollution remediation, etc... and are available in most every big city.  These jobs, for my understanding, generally involve a lot of report writing and the time spent ""in the field"" could easily be spent in an actual field, or parking lot, or construction site.  


That's a long winded start.  Feel free to ask some more pointed questions, or provide me with more info about what kind of research may sound interesting- that would help me drop some names of people that would be good to contact.

So r/geology, share your personal experience and lets compile a resource for new grads. I think we most want to hear info about...

* Flexibility in switching between O&amp;G/hydro/mining/env consulting careers.
* Starting salaries
* Landing a job internationally 
* What to put/not put on your resume/cv
* Cover Letters, how to introduce yourself
* Companies: Who to work for/ who to avoid
  
A profile of a recent grad (I'm sure this applies to many of us): I'm 24yo started school in Fall 2007, graduated Spring 2012 with a BS geology. I took an extra semester earning a GIS cert, and getting research experience. No graduate degreee,  but plan on getting it later down the road.

We all heard this before, our degree is pretty BA. In my case, my freshman adviser told me ""you will earn a degree in demand and shouldn't have any trouble landing your first job."" Granted I've just started the application process, I look forward to hearing some anecdotes. "	t5_2qshr	True

1345753412.0	ypq77	Mars Curiosity first ChemCam (laser spectroscopy) science results	bunabhucan	43	6	7	"NASA had a [news briefing](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/24889670) yesterday which included Roger Wiens (he starts at 11:45) talking about the [spectra results](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/679341main_pia16089_full.jpg) from the ChemCam test on ""Coronation"" as well as the additional targets on bedrock in the ""Goulburn"" scour mark uncovered by the landing rocket.

Plan is to travel to Glenelg (an area near the landing site chosen because it [marks the intersection of three kinds of terrain](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16064b.html)) and on the way look for scoopable fine material for [SAM](http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/sam/curiosity.html) and [CHEMIN](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/msl_chemin.html).

Most of the Q&amp;A were about the first drive and four for Roger Weins:

*Composition changes as the laser pulsed?*

""Hydrogen on surface. Hint in some other variation but could be one mineral grain to another.""


*Basalt Jim but not as we know it?*

Still working on calibrations. Higher sensitivity than anything we've used before. Wavelength shifts as Rover changes temperature during the day. Not looking at quantitative stuff yet. Not as quantitative as [APXS](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/astronomy/mars/apxs.asp). APXS and ChemCam compliment each other well. 


*How many targets in a day?*

20 analyses per day. Could be a while before that throughput is reached.


*How quickly can the data be analyzed?*

What did we recieve, are they ok etc.? Look at images/spectra. Within a couple of hours can catalog information and can present at science kickoff meeting followed by further analysis.

Left inset shows titanium and manganese traces. Lithium at 50ppm. Right inset includes Hydrogen signal on first two shots but not on subsequent (28) shots indicating hydrogen in outer dust/layer. Magnesium found on calibration targets and outer layers of targets also. 

&gt;Coronation's Chemicals

&gt;This is the first laser spectrum from the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument on NASA's Curiosity rover, sent back from Mars on August 19, 2012. The plot shows emission lines from different elements present in the target, a rock near the rover's landing site dubbed ""Coronation"" (see inset).

&gt;ChemCam's detectors observe light in the ultraviolet (UV), violet, visible and near-infrared ranges using three spectrometers, covering wavelengths from 240 to 850 nanometers. The light is produced when ChemCam’s laser pulse strikes a target, generating ionized gases in the form of plasma, which is then analyzed by the spectrometers and their detectors for the presence of specific elements. The detectors can collect up to 16,000 counts produced by the light in any of its 6,144 channels for each laser shot.

&gt;The plot is a composite of spectra taken over 30 laser shots at a single 0.016-inch (0.4-millimeter) diameter spot on the target. An inset on the left shows detail for the minor elements titanium and manganese in the 398-to-404-nanometer range. An inset at the right shows the hydrogen and carbon peaks. The carbon peak was from the carbon dioxide in Mars' air. The hydrogen peak was only present on the first laser shot, indicating that the element was only on the very surface of the rock. Magnesium was also slightly enriched on the surface. The heights of the peaks do not directly indicate the relative abundances of the elements in the rock, as some emission lines are more easily excited than others.

&gt;A preliminarily analysis indicates the spectrum is consistent with basalt, a type of volcanic rock, which is known from previous missions to be abundant on Mars. Coronation is about three inches (7.6 centimeters) across, and located about 5 feet (1.5 meters) from the rover and about nine feet (2.7 meters) from ChemCam on the mast.

  As a sophomore geology major, I am pretty new to the science, and I find it extremely humorous to see firsthand all of the stereotypes we fall into; the most notable and widespread stereotype within geologists being an appreciation for quality beer.

  Before I was a geology major, I had no idea this passionate love existed, but sure enough after a long field trip almost all of the undergrads, grads, and professors go straight to the pub to talk more geology and drink good beer. Alcoholic beverages are an obvious staple to the geology tailgates we have most sporting events. 
   Every ""non university sanctioned"" overnight field trip includes copious amounts of alcohol. I cannot wait for field camp, six weeks of camping, learning, and booze. 

  Geology attracts some of the most stand up people I have ever met. We are the seen as the blacksheep within the scientific world, but I am damn proud. People within the field are nice, willing to help, and in most cases, downright hilarious. Geology has a way of calling the right people for it. I have yet to meet a fellow geologist that I wouldn't, you guessed it, sit down and have a beer with.

   Sorry for rambling, but the geology rage comic, this video, and most importantly, this subreddit, have me feeling proud of my major and excited for my career.

I scoffed at this but then I got to thinking... What would it actually look like? 

Presumably a world-wide unconformity with detrital and angular, clastic sediments overlying it. Since all previous species died (including fish) during the flood there would be noticeable extinction events. Then perhaps as the seas receded a worldwide correlatable stratum of evaporites? 

That's my best guess so far! Let me know what you guys think. "	t5_2qshr	True
