This is only a tree

I will not tell you

it has a beautiful spirit.

I advise you to believe

nature carries no importance.

It is impossible to say

We should not just build over top it.

It's simply horrid.

Imagine a less natural world.

Imagine a place strictly man-made.

I don't expect a girl that cooks,

Or reads the smartest, arty books,

Or wows the world with wondrous looks,

So long as she's not Nicki Minaj.


Her nose would be so slightly bent,

Her wage would barely cover rent,

She'd be not quite from heaven sent,

But more importantly, not be Nicki Minaj.


Her poise and habits might be strange,

Her mind would rank in middle range,

Her flaws should seldom ever change,

Unless they include 'being Nicki Minaj'.


Beauty doesn't mean a thing,

Nor shape, nor wealth, nor clothes, nor bling,

She wouldn't need to dance or sing,

Especially not as poorly as Nicki Minaj.


She'd never be the very best,

With hair unmessed, or fans impressed,

Nor blessed with excess breast on chest,

But at least she wouldn't be Nicki Minaj.


My ideal girl might seem a bore,

But why insist on so much more?

She's not that short, annoying whore,

Called Nicki Minaj.

Still drunk  
And crawled silently into bed.  
I hadn't slept.  
I had spent all night waiting for her.  
I was now taking shirts off hangers.  
  
Later she woke and dressed.  
She was meeting a friend in Santa Barbara  
Two hours away.  
  
She saw my things.  
Folded, pressed, and snapped shut.  
She knew.  
  
She put her arms around me  
But all I could feel were bones  
And they were small and shaking.  
  
""I love you more than I've ever loved anyone.""  
""I know, sweetheart.""  
  
We kissed and she left.  
  
The afternoon sun retreated.  
I stood in the apartment in silence.  
  
I shaved my head and my face.  
I showered.  
I toweled my feet dry before stepping out.  
She had always scolded me  
For leaving puddles behind  
So this time I didn't  
Even though she'd never know.  
  
I fixed the towels on the rail.  
Even an act as simple as that carries weight  
When it's the last time.  
  
I broke down and cried  
Harder than I had in years  
Remembering the boy and the girl  
With two pet rabbits and barely a bed  
That had moved into that space a year ago.  
  
I looked for reasons to not leave,  
There were unwashed plates, and drawers ajar.  
A bowl full of limes sat on the counter.  
I had taken care choosing those  
And now they would rot or be eaten  
Either way, without me.  
  
I turned the key in the lock.  
It caught loudly.  
I stood still, trying to remember its sound.  

Then I boarded this bus,  
And wrote this for you.

Dear friends, neighbors and distant relations,  
we hereby extend our sincere salutations.  
You've now received one of several invitations  
to a party with friends, games, and decorations!  
 
It's Calvin's 4th birthday, you'll be happy to hear,  
and he'd like you to watch as he ages a year.  
He might grow a foot, though probably not,  
as three feet are one more than most people got.  
He might sound all deep, like a grown man might be,  
but I think he'll just sound like when he was three.  
He might grow a beard, like a real mountain man,  
Or flash his gold teeth and a seasonal tan.  
He might drive a car, or pilot a plane.  
He might be so old that he'll need a cane!  
One thing's for sure, and is plain as can be.  
Calvin's turning four, and will no longer be three.  
 
So please join us for what needs no explanations,  
no allegorical, metaphorical, categorical complications,  
no borin' or foreign or complex translations,  
but one of the year's most bestest celebrations!  "	t5_2qhhu	True

    so long?”

    “I love you” she says, in her soft gentle voice  
    But she doesn’t remember my name.  

    Our pace is quite slow as we traverse the hall  
    (Her left foot has now become lame)  
    She smiles as she lovingly touches my arm  
    But she doesn’t remember my name.  

    ""I’d like to go home with you,"" she often says  
     As somehow my heart fills with shame  
    She wants to leave and go home with me even  
    Though she doesn’t remember my name  

    So, here we are, in a crisis of time  
    Valiantly playing life’s game.  
    I squeeze her hand and she squeezes mine back  
    But she doesn’t remember my name.  

    The time we have left seems so horribly short;   
    Yet, there is one thing I can claim—  
    There will come a time we’re together again,  
    And I know she’ll remember my name.

    handed you a bible and told you

    that Jesus died for our sins;
    
    you flicked your cigarette onto 

    the concrete and said, ""I'm about

    to die for my own.""
    

    When you wept at night, 

    when you thought 

    I couldn't hear, you 

    cried out ""oh god, oh god""

who chases every falling star and never catching one.

    sixty seconds a minute,

    sixty minutes an hour,

    until your worth runs out

    with your youth.

    not even being able to get on the subway

    to buy alcohol.

    out there, shame is something even Chanel no. 5

    can’t cover up.


    They never tell you that by the time you find a boy

    to love, taking off your clothes will be like

    taking off bandages,

    like peeling off

    sunburnt skin.


    That your body

    will always come with

    strings attached, that this world

    is trench warfare

    and you are just a foot soldier.


    That some days you’ll feel 

    like a broken vase

    everyone keeps trying 

    to stick flowers in.


    You are not Schrodinger’s cat.

    You are not beautiful or ugly

    only until someone tells you so.


    But they don’t teach you that

    in high school.


    When you want to tell the guy on the bus

    to go fuck himself

    because he won’t leave you alone,

    you’ll bite your tongue instead

    and swallow your words, 

    collecting them underneath your ribcage:

    a hornet’s nest buzzing below your heart,

    reminding it not to feel too much 

    or beat too hard.


    And you’ll see him again the next day:

    same time, same place,

    with his hand

    up a girl’s skirt

1367064963.0	1d7nra	The Perfect High by Shel Silverstein	debilitation	136	16	11	"There once was a boy named Gimme-Some-Roy, and he was nothin' like me or you,
'cause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do.

As a kid, he sat in the cellar, sniffing airplane glue.
And then he smoked banana peels, when that was the thing to do. 
He tried aspirin in Coca-Cola, he breathed helium on the sly, 
and his life became an endless search to find the perfect high.

But grass just made him wanna lay back and eat choc-chip pizza all night,
and the great things he wrote when he was stoned looked like shit in the morning light.
Speed made him wanna rap all day, reds laid him too far back, 
Cocaine-Rose was sweet to his nose, but the price nearly broke his back.

He tried PCP, he tried THC, but they never quite did the trick. 
Poppers nearly blew his heart, and mushrooms made him sick. 
Acid made him see the light, but he couldn't remember it long. 
Hash was a little too weak, and smack was a lot too strong. 
Quaaludes made him stumble, booze just made him cry, 
Then he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now, Baba Fats was a hermit cat, lived high up in Nepal,
On a craggy mountain top, up a sheer and icy wall. 
""Well, hell!"" says Roy, ""I'm a healthy boy, and I'll crawl or climb or fly,
Till I find that guru who'll give me a clue as to what's the perfect high.""

So out and off goes Gimme-Some-Roy, to the land that knows no time,
Up a trail no man could conquer, to a cliff no man could climb. 
For fourteen years he climbed that cliff, back down again he'd slide,
He'd sit and cry, then climb some more, pursuing the perfect high.

Grinding his teeth, coughing blood, aching and shaking and weak, 
Starving and sore, bleeding and tore, he reaches the mountain peak. 
And his eyes blink red like a snow-blind wolf, and he snarls the snarl of a rat,
As there in repose, and wearing no clothes, sits the god-like Baba Fats.

""What's happenin', Fats?"" says Roy with joy, ""I've come to state my biz...
I hear you're hip to the perfect trip, please tell me what it is. 
""For you can see,"" says Roy to he, ""I'm about to die, 
So for my last ride, tell me, how can I achieve the perfect high?""

""Well, dog my cats!"" says Baba Fats. ""Another burned out soul, 
Who's lookin' for an alchemist to turn his trip to gold. 
It isn't in a dealer's stash, or on a druggist's shelf... 
Son, if you would find the perfect high, you'd find it in yourself.""

""Why, you jive mother-fucker!"" says Roy, ""I climbed through rain and sleet,
I froze three fingers off my hands, and four toes off my feet! 
I braved the lair of the polar bear, I've tasted the maggot's kiss. 
Now, you tell me the high is in myself? What kinda shit is this?

My ears, before they froze off,"" says Roy, ""had heard all kindsa crap; 
But I didn't climb for fourteen years to hear your sophomore rap. 
And I didn't climb up here to hear that the high is on the natch, 
So you tell me where the real stuff is, or I'll kill your guru ass!""

""Okay...okay,"" says Baba Fats, ""You're forcin' it outta me... 
There is a land beyond the sun that's known as Zabolee.
A wretched land of stone and sand, where snakes and buzzards scream, 
And in this devil's garden blooms the mystic Tzutzu tree.

Now, once every ten years it blooms one flower, as white as the Key West sky,
And he who eats of the Tzutzu flower shall know the perfect high. 
For the rush comes on like a tidal wave...hits like the blazin' sun. 
And the high? It lasts forever, and the down don't never come.

But Zabolee Land is ruled by a giant, who stands twelve cubits high, 
And with eyes of red in his hundred heads, he awaits the passer-by. 
And you must slay the red-eyed giant, and swim the river of slime, 
Where the mucous beasts await to feast on those who journey by. 
And if you slay the giant and beasts, and swim the slimy sea, 
There's a blood-drinking witch who sharpens her teeth as she guards the Tzutzu tree.""

Well, to hell with your witches and giants,"" says Roy, ""To hell with the beasts of the sea-
Why, as long as the Tzutzu flower still blooms, hope still blooms for me.""
And with tears of joy in his sun-blind eyes, he slips the guru a five, 
And crawls back down the mountainside, pursuing the perfect high.

""Well, that is that,"" says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his stone, 
Facing another thousand years of talking to God, alone. 
""Yes, Lord, it's always the same...old men or bright-eyed youth... 

It's always easier to sell 'em some shit than it is to tell them the truth.""

So that she'll understand just what you mean

She'll never understand that when you tell her that you want nothing more 

Than to let your dust be her dust, her words to be in your cheeks

Her nose to be your daughters nose

You mean that you want nothing more than to keep her forever.

But you never will.

Because you never stood a chance.

You thought that by giving your whole self over to her she would offer you the same respect.

That's not how this world works.

It never was.


These valiant efforts of yours are now dubbed selfish and inconsiderate by others

For not taking her feelings into account.

Because she doesn't know what true love is.

She never felt the need to have you near.

For her daughters smile to be your smile.

For your hands to cradle her head when she's sad.

    at your apartment, I find your first boyfriend

    in your cracked ash tray,


    the boy who called you a slut

    in the black turtlenecks you wear,

    the boy who said you were impossible to love

    in the depth of your embrace.


    You told me that they're long gone

    and that you're here with me

    now, but I can still hear them

    like muffled gunshots

    from around the block.


    I want to dip you 

    in ice water, bury you in sand,

    throw you over my shoulder

    like spilled salt. I want 

    to give you a new name.


    I want you to be mine,

    just mine, for one night.

    Lock ourselves in your bedroom

    and let the candles burn down

    to the wick.


    But you bleed forgiveness

    and it spreads across the bedsheets

    like the red harvest moon

    over wet pavement

    at 10 o'clock.


    I think of airplanes,

    and that they can only hold 

    up to 578 souls, like burning candles 

    in a midnight vigil, 

    and that people should have

    a maximum capacity too.


    You are the entire world 

    in one breath,

    and I am choking.

When I was about 13 I found this old book of Rudyard Kipling's work. I grew up knowing right from wrong because of what my parents told me but there was never any sort of manual, no summary. I believe this poem significantly shaped my morals, it was my manual. I think of it almost daily. 

If
If you can keep your head when all about you   
   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
   But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
   Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
   And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
   And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
   And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
   To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
   Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
   Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
   If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
   With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
   And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

He’s got questions.
A whole knapsack full of them.
And it weighs down upon his back,
Cracking, bending, breaking,
The little, brittle bones of his spine.
He’s like Atlas.
Like the Greek Titan of whom he’s read in books, 
not like the books of maps which he reads,
Which leads us to his first question;
Why does he like books so much?

Well, books speak to him when others refuse to,
Though it may be because he refuses to look them in the eye,
Because his nose is always buried in a book,
But that’s the chicken and the egg.
That’s just another question. 

Another burden.
It’s funny.
People use the word “cross” to mean burden. “That’s my cross to bear.”
And yet, their crosses of sliver and gold that they wear around their neck,
Miniature billboards professing prolonged connection and affection with an imaginary friend,
They seem so light.
He has long since been abandoned by his imaginary friends.
Though he still wanders in the same twisted fantasy land,
He is alone, and that is his burden.

Another question:
Is being alone a burden, or a blessing?
He seems to think the latter,
Weekend night after weekend night, hunched over on the Berber rug,
Suckling ash from glass, breathing fire into the air purifier,
Seeking to melt his mind melt into juvenility.

He says he’s not one for numbers, but by his count,
There are one hundred billion neurons in his brain,
And he has an IQ of one hundred and seventy five,
So if he grinds up snorts a thousand milligrams of Sudafed,
And slits his wrists seventeen times, and cries,
Until he loses seventy-five cc’s of blood,
And his veins are dried,
Then by the time that he wakes up in the hospital,
He should still be able to read at a third-grade level.

And when he was in third grade, he read the whole King James Bible from front to back,
Though all it did was leave him with more questions.

It was the first day of first grade,

I was sitting on my bench as my thoughts strayed.

I promise I was barely there, some kids had their heads in the clouds,

I had mine in the atmosphere.

Of course I couldn't focus on what the teacher said

when the new Little Pirate kit lied waiting impatiently in my backpack.

This kit contained a spyglass, a compass and a cutlass,

just wanted to grab my backpack and cut class.

But as I sat in the bench the backpack was just out of my reach,

so close yet so far away,

teacher told me to pay attention but my body was locked and my thoughts they would stray,

dreaming about sitting in the dock of the bay.

In my dreams I would be a pirate,

sailing the seven seas with a jolly roger flag waving in the breeze,

bombarding enemy ships into debris

I had a short attention span,

barely noticed that my teacher read aloud from Peter Pan.

I suddenly felt her eyes on me like laser-beams penetrating my dreams.

She asked me if I had a problem with the book and I shook my head.

I just wanted to be the crook in every book I read.

I just wanted to be Captain Hook and he wanted Peter to drop dead

Everyone, including my teacher, laughed.

I don't even remember her name, or why she laughed at me.

I called her Mrs. Shedevil and I wanted to watch her drown below sea level.

I don't even know what she needed me to be,

but when I'm older I'll be a pirate and I'll feed her to the sea.

I guess what I want to say is,

my teacher embodied the reality that was forced upon me and my classmates.

The same reality that tells little kids that there is no secret entrance to Narnia in their closet,

they will never receive a letter from Hogwarts,

Santa isn't real, and their parents will die one day.

Now snap back from the backtrack and I've grown,

shape shifted like shaving foam and the dream of being a pirate was at first postponed but now it's buried 
underneath a tombstone.

I found my old backpack in the attic the other day,

for now it is there it will stay,

I'm going to keep it until the day I have a child but then I'll give it away.

I promise I will put a snow-cannon in my child's closet,

write fake letters from Hogwarts,

dress as Santa every Christmas and tell my child I'm immortal.

Of course that would be a lie,

and just like my dreams of being a pirate,

one day I will die.

When I had my dream about being a pirate I was bound to wake up and the dream was bound to end,

but for the sake of our children sometimes we will have to pretend.

1361719724.0	194uwl	Sup r/Poetry! I've spent over 100 hours on this poem. It is by far my greatest artistic achievement to date. I'm pretty pumped and wanted to share it and hear what y'all think. Here's [Between Fronts].	bonecrusher2102	93	19	56	"“Between Fronts”

Sometimes the street’s gray concrete 

starts to creep up over the grass

rolling over the lawn all the way up

to my front door, killing the green

and claiming the space as its own.

I see it moving and I flee the city,

taking air in big, panicked gulps

until the rot rolling through

my car windows is replaced

by grass and rain-wet air.

The pavement at my back

urges me into the country,

onto dirt roads and our house

above the lake, where I

can stand on the balcony

and lean into cool wind.



		٭	



I hear her voice at times like these.

“Go.” She tells me. “You’re always better 

after you get out of the city for a while.

That’s the reason your grandfather

bought a ranch, right? That’s why he built

a house on it. He knows you need an escape

from your life here every once in a while.

Things are easier out there, slower, cleaner.

I promise, you’ll come back

feeling whole.”



		٭



The area just northeast of the house is host 

to an annual meeting of two large weather fronts 

which converge in the early months of summer, 

and result in a chain of storms that can last months. 

The house’s back wall is covered with storm 

windows, large enough to admit a view 

of the horizon in panorama, and thick enough 

to endure facing directly into the hard, constant 

wind out the northeast. In the early summer, 

you can watch the wind heave thunderheads

straight at you. They eat up the horizon, shadows

racing across the lake and up the back porch.



At night, the lightning burns 

your storm-dark vision 

with such remorseless detail 

that the images linger

briefly in negative 

before fading away,


like a too-vivid memory 

that screams to be remembered,

but is ignored by eyes grown 

accustomed to only grays 

and dull edges.




		٭



Out on the balcony, I sweat 

beside my grandfather in the coming dusk.

We’ve spend the day in the pasture

uprooting mesquite trees 

and stacking them into burn piles.

Grandfather says that once the fields

are clear we might plant some cotton.

*Then you’ll find out what real work is,*

he tells me. Just last week

I saved a man who hung himself

down in the Huntsville state prison.

Hangings will usually void their bowels,

but when we cut off his pants

there was nothing but a little blood,

so we checked him for wounds

and found that he had recently

suffered severe rectal tearing.

The mass of fresh sutures around his anus

prevented any rectal prolapse

or involuntary bowel movement.

I stand with my grandfather,

watching the sky change

and say nothing.

In the fields behind us

piles of dead mesquite

quietly wait to be burned.



		٭



I used to watch the stars out there.

They were clearest in winter,

when it would get so cold

that the air molecules 

would just stand still 

and let the starlight

pass right through them,

unbent by motion

or the glare of a city,

landing like snowflakes

on upturned eyes.

It was like that for years, 

until oil was discovered

in the shale deposit

that ran through the county.

In months giant, still derricks  

lined the horizon

like a dozen skylines 

in miniature

sprung up so suddenly 

that the surrounding air

was startled into motion,

waving, pulsing with the heat

of the gas flares

lighting up the night

alongside the derricks


by hurrying fuel 

from the deep 

and setting it 

immediately to burn

atop tall thin towers.

The flames were bright 

and constant and slipped

like a blanket between

me and the stars.

In the darkness after

the only light comes

from their sick yellow glow.



		٭



Thunder wakes me from a dream

of King Lear in the squall.

Rain and wind pound storm windows

and I’m starting to remember

where I am when my grandfather

bursts in the room wet and naked

shouting that the fields are ready

to be planted and it’s time I found out

how real men earn a living.

I’m up and words of protest

begin to form in my mouth

but are caught somewhere

in the larynx as I look down 

at my own nakedness 

to find my body hairless

and prepubescent, exposed

testicles humiliatingly undescended.

A bolt of lightning fills

my vision with a sea of white

and the storm window

behind my grandfather erupts

in a shower of glass shards.

I blink away the light

before seeing him on the floor,

still yelling—his admonitions

becoming frantic, deranged,

as he tells me that city-life

has reduced me to nothing but

*a poor, bare, forked animal,*

and begins to weep as he asks

why I won’t let him teach me

to be a man like he did my father

and looking at me his mouth

twists in that vicious brand of disgust

the old and hard reserve

for weakness nurtured by privilege.

The question escapes like a death-rattle: 

*is man no more than this?*

Too-wet eyes stare red and unblinking,

as I pull on my uniform and open

the trauma bag to get an IV started,

but when I do he rips out the needle,

and when I try to stop the bleeding

he pulls away the gauze

and claws at his lacerations

until shock and blood loss

drag him into unconsciousness.

When I begin mouth to mouth

my teeth crumble and fall

into his airway, suffocating him.



		٭



I say it again to be sure: It’s not real.



		٭



From the balcony I watch the lake

slowly grow darker as red algae spreads

through it like rust. It will kill every

living thing in the lake before it too dies.



		٭



the smell of the diesel won’t come out

of my fucking clothes it follows

me like a deathwatch clinging 

to my hair and my skin

I kneel behind the ambulance where

the tailpipe sends off heat in waves 

and almost instantly grafts the soft 

tissue of my lips onto the soot-black metal

when I wrap my mouth around it

and inhale lungfulls of exhaust

with desperate heaving gasps 

that wrack my chest like spasms

and burst the vessels in my eyes

until the white of the sclera 

is replaced with a red hemorrhage

that spreads across my face like rust

and turns tears pink with blood

until black finally starts to creep

around the edges of my vision

and all I can see are twin streams

of smoke rising out of my nostrils



		٭



My grandfather takes me to the middle

of our property, where a long burn

has been cleared for the pipeline 

that now runs beneath where we stand. 

*This is where we’ll plant it.* He says.

*You’re too young to know it,*

*but things are about to get real bad.*

*We’re going to have to be able*

*to take care of ourselves.* He 

laughs. *You might just have*

*to do a little bit of real work.*

The ground is muddy,

and has been cleared for twenty

yards on either side of us, ending

where the mesquite forms a wall 

that stretches along the burn’s edge

for its entire length.

I notice that the mud

Has bubbled up in places,

forming pools that give off

the dark, unnatural sheen

of chemical infiltration.

I imagine pushing my fingers

into the earth to make 

way for seed. Black

oil rushes in to fill the hole,

eager to poison, eager to blight.

I listen to my grandfather

knowing that whatever we plant

here will grow only briefly

if at all, and will never

be enough to sustain us.

I agree that some horrible 

change is coming,

but it will be slower

and more real 

than my grandfather

believes. I’ve seen it 

with a closeness

he isn’t strong enough for.

I know it in a way he will refuse

to until it has him,

because of the way it reeks

of shit and piss,

and because it is humiliating

and difficult and lets you know

in no uncertain terms

that you must face it alone.

It is boring, and in the end

unemotional, except for relief

and guilt over that relief.

It is selfish, it moves

quickly forward and is soon

unashamed of it,

because pain is only truly

real when it is your pain,

and nothingness cannot

be truly real for anyone,

and because it is so easy 

to dwell on other things.

Old fields lay fallow, 

the crops of the past

are consumed and forgotten.

The ground is poison,

it kills all its children. 



		٭ 


I say it again




		٭ 



I can smell summer coming

in the wind, cooled

over the lake and sweetened

by the cattail, the little bluestem

reeds circling the water.

It catches dovecalls,

the low cicada-hum,

and I know the heat

is not far off now,


that our brief respite

is drawing to a close,

that I am once again

tilting to face the sun.

I spin toward summer

growing restless, growing mad.

Even the wind knows it.



		٭



I say it again



		٭



24 hours without sleep

and the lights are burning 

out my night vision

I can feel them like needles

behind my eyes

I smash the headlights

and walk over the shards

in my bare feet



		٭



I’m in the back

of the ambulance

with a patient while we

transport him to the hospital

but he is screaming

he won’t stop and my god

he’s been at it the whole ride

I make sure the straps

fastening him to the stretcher

are secure

then open the back doors

and roll him out

onto the blaring

freeway where he is hit

by the oncoming traffic



		٭



I deliver a baby

on the floor of a project apartment

surrounded by the stinking 

refuse of its tenants

I stare at empty mcdonalds

bags and cups and napkins

as I push both thumbs

through the soft spot

of the infant’s head



		٭ 



I return to the city just ahead of the rain.

The smell of it is heavy in the air, inescapable.



I return to the city always

trapped in the dark

liminality



between opposing fronts,

static and useless

and beginning to stagnate;

reduced



to a desperate collection

of hair and skin,

knocked about 

by the wind

as all the flailing, 

token resistance

is slowly and perfectly

robbed of force

and of meaning

until there is only

resignation—



a lifting of closed eyes

some final moments

spent as a living

ground for the storm’s

unthinking energy.

    and you don't answer at the door, I fumble

    with the doormat until I find the spare key.

    Your apartment

    feels like a photograph, sodium glow

    and floating dust. 

    And I know.


    The bathroom is shut

    and the lights are on

    and it's quiet. Part of me

    wants you to be alright,

    shaving your legs 

    in the bathtub. Part of me

    wants the waiting to stop,

    to stop breathing the dust

    of your painted life.


    I think of when I first laid eyes on you,
    
    three years ago,

    sitting on a park bench

    dressed in August heat. And how part of me

    thought, don't look at me,

    don't look at me 

    so I can still turn around. 

    And how the other part screamed:

    look at me or I'll die.


    (Don't they say the end

    is only as good 

    as the beginning?)


    When I open the door

    and see you on the linoleum floors,

    covered in red, tall thin legs

    like organ pipes and eyes

    like the deep end of the pool,

    like the step you take

    after you turn the lights off,

    I fold myself over you

    and remember two nights ago

    when I combed your hair,

    it smelled like strawberries

    but darker
    
    and just as sweet

    and you cried

    and I told you to stay

    and you said,

    where am I going?


    (I remember you told me

    that when you were young,

    you used to let your balloons go

    on purpose.)


    When I look up at the ceiling

    to see the last thing you saw,

    speckled off-white,

    I hope that the part of you

    that wanted to let go

    wasn't the part that kissed my neck

    in the middle of the night.

    it was."	t5_2qhhu	True

    And told you that  
    I think  
    There are some parts of a person  
    That should be kept,  
    And not be thrown away.  

    Your family didn’t understand  
    That I refused  
    To simply be bent and worn  
    Like the ring on this ‘ring finger’  
    Of my left hand.  

    But the truth is I’m already worn  
    By so many people I no longer know  
    Like a hoody left behind after a one-night-stand.  

    As hard as I’ve tried  
    To keep myself contained  
    In each escape  
    I’ve spilled over  
    And given parts of me away.  
    And I resent  
    That someone somewhere  
    Has my virginity screwed up  
    In a pile of dirty washing on his floor.  
    And someone somewhere  
    Has my favourite place by the river  
    Pushed back amongst the rubbish in his chest of drawers.  
    And someone somewhere  
    Wears my favourite song so smugly  
    Every time  
    I see his fucking face contort  
    That fucking grin that says  
    “I know you”  
    In a way  
    I can’t displace.  

    So when you tried to take my name  
    I told you no 
    As it would only be  
    Another part of me I can’t reclaim.  

    I’ve learned to hold on tight  
    To who I am  
    Because so much of her  
    Is in places I can’t reach

We are currently brianstorming (not brainstorming, we dont want headaches) about new ideas and ways to help people get more out of /r/poetry.**I'm not going over them here (there will be a more, official post about it once we know for sure what we are doing), but I wanted you guys to know that we are doing something, and to not give up on us.**

Feel free to come to us if you have a great and reasonable idea (people are misunderstaning the intent on this post) , but please do not be offended if we dont use it. It's not as easy as you think to just change whatever. 


Also, if you haven't already, welcome /u/floatbox to our mod team. He had a voice, used it, and is now a valuable part of what is going on in this sub, so dont think for an instant that your voice doesn't matter here!!

1361300227.0	18tzla	"[Why even the criticism sucks here] (or, let's debunk this ""everything is art"" baloney)"	1b1d	72	15	67	"The highest voted submissions are those that decry this sub. Today it's ""Why I'm unsubscribing."" Last week was ""Poetry can suck my dick."" Both of these popped into my newsfeed and reminded me that this sub exists. I did my duty of reading through the comments—but when I reached the argument on the subjectivity of ""good"" and ""bad"" in the arts I had to walk away and stew for a bit.

There is always the opinion that one isn't able to say what is ""good"" and what is ""bad"" art. The explanation is invariably because someone *else* might find what you find distasteful tasty, or may be reviled by what you are enamored with. This is true—there is not quantifying taste. Not exactly. But to simply barf out this point every time someone attempts to make a value judgment on art is puerile and sophomoric.

Yes, I'm making a value judgment on this act of *criticism*, or opinionated interpretation. **Because it doesn't go far enough.** It is a rehashing of an attitude that came about as a reaction to several successive movements within the arts, and *at the time of its inception* it did have some **power** to it. But in this day and age (of infinite crap) it is a statement without testicles, or ovaries, and only breeds laziness in those who would create, and disinterest in those who would engage with what's been created.

If we want to speak of subjectivity and relativism then let us begin with the assumption that **there is value in the act of creating art.** This value is derived not from *quanta* but from *qualia.* 

Quanta is latin for ""how much?"" It is used by physicists to demarcate discrete values in any given phenome. To say that something is ""quantifiable"" usually means it can be objectively measured. Qualia, however, comes from ""what kind?"" and is a subjective measurement of phenomen that are encountered by consciousness. The pain of a headache, the color of dawn—these things are qualia, and their *communication* is subjective to the power of the consciousness which experiences them to reconstitute them in the consciousness of another—through music, poetry, painting, etc.

Of course one person will resonate with an artwork that another ""doesn't get."" That is not what is at issue here. What is at issue is the ability of the poet to reconstitute and to evoke various states in the experience of the reader. That power has an inherent aspect to it (from whence the phrase ""A poet is born, not made"") but also it requires effort and intention and *training*—by which we mean exposure to previous forms, practice and experimentation.

Likewise, the act of criticism, too, comes naturally in varying degrees, and needs to be trained in order to do the work of *examining what makes something work.* A poem is not a mechanism, but the trained and sensitive critic will be able to elicit its various (subtle) functions.

To speak to the ""Harry Potter"" generation—the poet is a magician. She summons not a spell with a specific effect (that would be rhetoric, or advertising), but rather a *state.* In this way—thinking about about art in this way—allows us, as viewers, to measure the qualia of an artwork as though it were a quanta. We can speak of meter and content and context—the material manifestations of the ""actual"" poem, and comment on these in a rational manner. We can also approach the so-called meaning, that which is aesthetically pleasing in the artwork as through it were, as it were, a vibration and an emanation of a conscious state of being, and in doing that, and examining *that* we can extrapolate *why* we have had the reactions we've had.

This is quite an investment, on the part of the viewer, and there is too much shit that doesn't deserve this level of attention. But insofar as we hold the act of creation as valuable—in itself—we should be requiring a certain level of *quality* from those who would create.

To that end, I am experimenting with a weekly thread that will teach us tools of the trade that we can play with in our own writing. And we're going to be learning in the best way possible: by reading some awesome verse. 


**The rules for this thread:** In a comment, post a poem (link or full text) that is excellent in at least one area and follow it with a paragraph or two explaining what makes it so good. 


My hope is that this will strengthen our culture of learning and broaden our taste. I look forward to learning from you! My first lesson is posted below in the comments. Please comment, ask questions, and contribute. I hope you enjoy!

    seven months ago 

    that was sixteen minutes long. 

    The first twenty seconds 

    were you reminding me 

    to pick up some food 

    because all that was left in the fridge 

    were two rotten peaches. You had forgotten 

    to hang up then, and stuck the phone 

    in your coat pocket.


    Fifteen and a half minutes 

    of you breathing. 

    I drank it in like cough syrup, 

    listening to it over and over and over again, 

    always stopping it 

    before it ended, 

    always stopping it 

    before you took the last breath.


    I lined up your things on my bookshelf 

    the way a doctor keeps objects 

    from foreign body surgeries, 

    the way kids keep their baby teeth

    in their sock drawer. 

    An old tube of lipstick, 

    a leather notebook, 

    a bottle of perfume, 

    wondering if I could fold them inside of me 

    like a Russian nesting doll.


    I put them in my car one morning 

    and drove out to the lake 

    and threw them in, one by one. 

    I played the voicemail 

    to the end 

    and heard your heartbeat 

    stop 

    and watched the sky 

    turn to mist around me: 

    the view of the world 

    through an old lace-trimmed blouse.
 

    I remember reading somewhere 

    that watching the fog rise in the morning 

    was just like watching 

    a human soul 

    evaporate.

1363101805.0	1a5fwh	A fix for this subreddit.	FloatBox	61	14	68	"So for a while now, a post happens every couple of weeks. You know the one. This place sucks. It's a dumping ground for the amateurs. No good feedback. Homogeneity abound.

Then everybody comments these fiery, like yeah totally, it could be better if only we didn't suck! And then someone's like, well what does it mean to suck, and more people pile on and lo and behold it's interesting. People pour in to the sub. Then a mod shows up to throw up their hands and it all kind of boils back down. 

A sense of powerlessness runs through. 

Nothing changes. The next day, seventeen out of the twenty front page poems are dead with zero comments, one upvote or two. 18k subscribers.

Last month something pretty wild happened that changed my perspective of poetry as an uber-niche medium. I posted Tryken's [awesome analysis]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/18vssc/tryken_shows_the_difference_between_a_good_and/) to r/depthhub and the thing went on to reach the top 25 submission of all-time. Poetry, the medium that is supposedly irrelevant and dead overwhelmingly captured the imagination of the non-poet. People were saying how they never had an interest in poetry until that post. Now, they said, they had to subscribe to r/poetry!

I'm sure we can all imagine how that went.

It's funny how, on the sidebar to related subs, r/writing is (modless.) As if r/poetry isn't.

The FIX: For anyone to post a poem, they must have provided feedback to five other poems. Actual feedback. At least a paragraph.

This should have several effects. First being a certain massive cut-down on what is essentially spam. You must put in some work for your poem to be submitted. If you don't want to contribute to the community, you don't have to. 

Second, it will make the bad poems actually worth reading because now they'll be a potentially interesting discussion brewing in each one on what works and what doesn't. Every post is a prompt for an exchange of ideas and values. Its more satisfying for the submitters actually being read and responded to as well as making us readers better at interpreting poetry. So we become better poets.

Speaking of which, many of you probably don't know how to give analysis. It's ok. It's a practice. You can learn if you want to. It's a complimentary art form to poetry. [Here](http://www.ehow.com/how_2046136_analyze-poem.html) is a great place to start thinking about how you can respond to poetry here.

And what if we had a feedbacker of the week? We vote who gives the most effortful, detailed, valuable feedback and give them spotlight. We should be rewarding those who enrich this sub!

All of this requires more effort. A higher level of engagement. But that's what we want, isn't it?

**EDIT FOR CLARITY and SPECIFICALS:**

The one main mechanic I'm proposing is that to submit a poem, the submitter must first give a paragraph of feedback to five different poems. All other OC is deleted.

It could be as easy as at the end of every submitted poem, the submitter links those five instances. If they don't -- deleted. If they link to comments little more than one line -- deleted. Link the offending poster to the official rule change. Readers will let the mods know if the poem isn't supported by feedback. It's all upfront.

Also, it doesn't necessarily need to be five. It could be two. One for starters. I would like to see five, personally.

It'll take heavy moderation to change the culture here. Once it's established, it shouldn't be so hard at all.

Love became me as my heart took to a girl that cuddled into a ball  
and drew for hours with me watching   
patiently,  
because she found comfort in just knowing  
someone was there.  
Oblivious, or maybe  
it was the tinted glasses, designed to slow  
and simplify the growing, throbbing, pulsating,  
hot, hot, needing world around her,  
she couldn't admit it was too scary,  
she just drew me instead.  




Three months later I fell for a boy that took my word for truth  
yet sat and pondered the origin of truth for hours.  
Masturbation, or maybe  
a patience that could appreciate what the fast-moving eye sped by  
each day. Some other lover could have taken a drag,  
and shared his gentle way but  
I had no time for benefits of mind and body.  




Five months past and then I was in the cross hairs of an  
armed woman that had the strength to sprint  
with ten thousand bricks on her back and  
never quit, just set fire  
to those who laid in her path.  
So they kept on piling bricks and countless lovers were charred,  
til I laid down, tripped her up, and watched the brick city fall.  
Overwhelming, yes, constantly, but with a burning passion that  
none had yet to survive.  
I quit since she couldn't kill me.  




It wasn't two weeks before I locked eyes with a boy that cried when I cried  
and needed to be squeezed as tightly as possible, at least once a day.  
A fragile sapling that, under close watch, could bloom to a tall and sturdy oak.  
I lead his roots to the clear, rushing brook and as he drank, I drank.  
He grew, I replenished and that affair of friends came to an end.

Still its more messy than all future sessions.

For we live and we learn; so never again

will the young boy finish all over his bed.

Instead he'll get smart, learn the ways of the sock

the toilet, the shower, outside on a rock.

It creeps people out, and its very taboo

yet everyone does it; John, Jill, even you.

1375129749.0	1jathr	[ Rape Joke ] A Poem by Patricia Lockwood	parthuman	53	11	19	"*Not for feedback. Full poem below.*

**Rape Joke**

&gt; The rape joke is that you were 19 years old.

&gt; The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend.

&gt; The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.

&gt; Imagine the rape joke looking in the mirror, perfectly reflecting back itself, and grooming itself to look more like a rape joke. “Ahhhh,” it thinks. “Yes. A goatee.”

&gt; No offense.

&gt; The rape joke is that he was seven years older. The rape joke is that you had known him for years, since you were too young to be interesting to him. You liked that use of the word interesting, as if you were a piece of knowledge that someone could be desperate to acquire, to assimilate, and to spit back out in different form through his goateed mouth.

&gt; Then suddenly you were older, but not very old at all.

&gt; The rape joke is that you had been drinking wine coolers. Wine coolers! Who drinks wine coolers? People who get raped, according to the rape joke.

&gt; The rape joke is he was a bouncer, and kept people out for a living.

&gt; Not you!

&gt; The rape joke is that he carried a knife, and would show it to you, and would turn it over and over in his hands as if it were a book.

&gt; He wasn’t threatening you, you understood. He just really liked his knife.

&gt; The rape joke is he once almost murdered a dude by throwing him through a plate-glass window. The next day he told you and he was trembling, which you took as evidence of his sensitivity.

&gt; How can a piece of knowledge be stupid? But of course you were so stupid.

&gt; The rape joke is that sometimes he would tell you you were going on a date and then take you over to his best friend Peewee’s house and make you watch wrestling while they all got high.

&gt; The rape joke is that his best friend was named Peewee.

&gt; OK, the rape joke is that he worshiped The Rock.

&gt; Like the dude was completely in love with The Rock. He thought it was so great what he could do with his eyebrow.

&gt; The rape joke is he called wrestling “a soap opera for men.” Men love drama too, he assured you.

&gt; The rape joke is that his bookshelf was just a row of paperbacks about serial killers. You mistook this for an interest in history, and laboring under this misapprehension you once gave him a copy of Günter Grass’s My Century, which he never even tried to read.

&gt; It gets funnier.

&gt; The rape joke is that he kept a diary. I wonder if he wrote about the rape in it.

&gt; The rape joke is that you read it once, and he talked about another girl. He called her Miss Geography, and said “he didn’t have those urges when he looked at her anymore,” not since he met you. Close call, Miss Geography!

&gt; The rape joke is that he was your father’s high-school student—your father taught World Religion. You helped him clean out his classroom at the end of the year, and he let you take home the most beat-up textbooks.

&gt; The rape joke is that he knew you when you were 12 years old. He once helped your family move two states over, and you drove from Cincinnati to St. Louis with him, all by yourselves, and he was kind to you, and you talked the whole way. He had chaw in his mouth the entire time, and you told him he was disgusting and he laughed, and spat the juice through his goatee into a Mountain Dew bottle.

&gt; The rape joke is that come on, you should have seen it coming. This rape joke is practically writing itself.

&gt; The rape joke is that you were facedown. The rape joke is you were wearing a pretty green necklace that your sister had made for you. Later you cut that necklace up. The mattress felt a specific way, and your mouth felt a specific way open against it, as if you were speaking, but you know you were not. As if your mouth were open ten years into the future, reciting a poem called Rape Joke.

&gt; The rape joke is that time is different, becomes more horrible and more habitable, and accommodates your need to go deeper into it.

&gt; Just like the body, which more than a concrete form is a capacity.

&gt; You know the body of time is elastic, can take almost anything you give it, and heals quickly.

&gt; The rape joke is that of course there was blood, which in human beings is so close to the surface.

&gt; The rape joke is you went home like nothing happened, and laughed about it the next day and the day after that, and when you told people you laughed, and that was the rape joke.

&gt; It was a year before you told your parents, because he was like a son to them. The rape joke is that when you told your father, he made the sign of the cross over you and said, “I absolve you of your sins, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,” which even in its total wrongheadedness, was so completely sweet.

&gt; The rape joke is that you were crazy for the next five years, and had to move cities, and had to move states, and whole days went down into the sinkhole of thinking about why it happened. Like you went to look at your backyard and suddenly it wasn’t there, and you were looking down into the center of the earth, which played the same red event perpetually.

&gt; The rape joke is that after a while you weren’t crazy anymore, but close call, Miss Geography.

&gt; The rape joke is that for the next five years all you did was write, and never about yourself, about anything else, about apples on the tree, about islands, dead poets and the worms that aerated them, and there was no warm body in what you wrote, it was elsewhere.

&gt; The rape joke is that this is finally artless. The rape joke is that you do not write artlessly.

&gt; The rape joke is if you write a poem called Rape Joke, you’re asking for it to become the only thing people remember about you.

&gt; The rape joke is that you asked why he did it. The rape joke is he said he didn’t know, like what else would a rape joke say? The rape joke said YOU were the one who was drunk, and the rape joke said you remembered it wrong, which made you laugh out loud for one long split-open second. The wine coolers weren’t Bartles &amp; Jaymes, but it would be funnier for the rape joke if they were. It was some pussy flavor, like Passionate Mango or Destroyed Strawberry, which you drank down without question and trustingly in the heart of Cincinnati Ohio.

&gt; Can rape jokes be funny at all, is the question.

&gt; Can any part of the rape joke be funny. The part where it ends—haha, just kidding! Though you did dream of killing the rape joke for years, spilling all of its blood out, and telling it that way.

&gt; The rape joke cries out for the right to be told.

&gt; The rape joke is that this is just how it happened.

&gt; The rape joke is that the next day he gave you Pet Sounds. No really. Pet Sounds. He said he was sorry and then he gave you Pet Sounds. Come on, that’s a little bit funny.

&gt;Admit it.

In the fell clutch of circumstance

My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears  
Looms but the Horror of the shade,  
And yet the menace of the years  
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  

It matters not how strait the gate,  
How charged with punishments the scroll.  
I am the master of my fate:  
I am the captain of my soul.

If a time traveler swapped my adolescent brain I'd be asking you how.

How could you?

I've been racking my brain to find answers for years,

The pool of confusion you and mom created were built with my tears,

I remember laying in my bunk bed, wishing I didn't have ears

Because the things you were yelling at mom was too hard to hear.

I didn't understand.

My pillow was my microphone when I was speaking to God.

And my prayers were never audible because they came out in sobs.

And when my baby brother came to me for answers,

What do you say? The things I was thinking I couldn't convey.

He was your son, but he was my brother.

And for those rocky divorce years, we protected one another.

I sheltered him from the hate, the horrors of love,

But it's hard to do that when you're in the kitchen and we're above.

I've cursed the loft of our house a thousand times,

Being built for echoing, these vibrations seemed like crimes.

I didn't understand

""Don't listen to your mother, she's gone wrong in the head.

Everything you know about her, surely you've misread.

I don't know where we'll live son, but I'll figure it out.

Just don't tell your brother; it's nothing to worry him about.""

When I heard that, I felt like a desert. You deserted me.

And back then I thought I deserved it, the blame was easy to see.

Maybe if I cleaned my room more and did chores around the house,

You'd put the bottle down and not fight with your spouse.

I was a lost cause, but my brother was still pure,

So I protected him at all costs, I had to ensure

He wouldn't wind up like me.

Fucked in the head, no sign for a cure.

But looking back on it years later, it wasn't my fault.

I want to blame you but I love you with all my heart.

I want to hate you but where can I start?

The feelings I had when I was a kid can't be erased

But the emotions I have now seem like they can't be faced.

So I pick up the bottle and start to take your place.

I realize now how you dealt with yourself,

Grabbing another beer bottle from the top of the shelf.

It feels good for now, and I've got all night.

And when tomorrow rolls around, in the booze, I'll take flight.

With Father’s starred helmet brought home from the war,  
We found in the attic one day.  
But maybe it starts with the tune of the wheels  
As hammered on rails by the train.  
With youth’s sacred vow that you swore to Her,  
That day when your heart was aflame…  
Say where does you Homeland begin for you?

By Russell Frost

.

Two jims diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not rustle both

And see them rustling, long I stood

Considering one as long as I could;

I must fulfill my rustle oath.

.

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better jims,

They needed rustling, that much was clear;

But as for that, the rustling air

Had roused them really about the same,


.

And both that morning still remained

As jims no force had rus'd about.

For now my rustling was restrained

To the latter, though I could not feign

Return, for I was fraught with doubt.

.

I shall be rustling with a sigh

Some jims ages and ages hence:

Two jims diverged in a wood and I,

I rustled those less rustled by,

And that has made all the difference.

    You wore a loose floral shirt

    that must have held 
    a fancy picture.


    Stop it. You know I'm not
    good enough for you.

    That's why I don't let you buy marlbros and
    You can't try drugs you never heard of.

    to sit motionless under her tongue...

    Fools!
    That is the reason to smoke.
    Suicide should be very

    Have you ever sat 
    completely still, alone,
    naked, in your backyard
    while it is raining?
    Close your eyes as you do so,
    love life so intensely
    that yours becomes insignificant
    and the preservation of theirs,
    the thriving of theirs!!
    becomes milk and honey.

No poems about how much you loved your grandmother and no little girls’ ribbon bows, the ends of your poems as tidy as folded laundry, and we’d like to put a stop to your sloppy similes because life really isn’t like a lawnmower gone astray. Life isn’t like a puppy smashed on the road or how unsettled you were when she kissed you good night and there was a little rise in your britches. Who cares, really, at the end of a hard day, if your first kiss was in a game of truth or dare and Tammy Elliot only kissed you because she lost? Let’s have no poems about kissing or that tangle of backwash at the back of your throat. Who cares if you squeezed that kitten, just to see what’d happen? Who cares if you’re sorry, if your despair (don’t call it that!) leads you to write an I’m-so-sorry poem, which leads you naturally to the blood on the Kleenex after the fight and all your now-forbidden teenaged angst welling up in a poem about the meaning of the universe unveiling itself on a shadowy night, inky black, and weren’t you listening to the instructions? No black poems, no white poems, no cookie-cutter hearts or muffled moans of pleasure. No going gently into that good night and definitely no stopping by the woods on a snowy evening. Just keep it simple, keep it plain, and please, please, no poems about your dead mother, how the clods of red Georgia clay hit the top of her coffin, thuck, thuck, thuck. Just take it easy with the alliteration and please, for the love of all that’s holy, no onomatopoeia.

Every drop and every sip of you is like another death  
All over again like every other time   
  
I wanted to die and now it hurts to speak  
Like I can hardly squeeze out a penstroke to describe  
The incredible, astronomical pain you cause me  
  
If I could turn tears to wine I would drink them   
My old friend, you and I have seen so many new deaths  
So many sleeping fits and insomniatic bouts  
  
Of insanity that I could hardly confine, here I am  
Here is I so tired and tired and tired and giving it all away  
To a sigh like a drink of something greater, something greater than that which is I  
  
My god and my killer, my slow and morbid murder that  
Creeps its way into my eyes like a plague which unwraps me  
And ties me up again in the most illogical ways  
  
A pressure beats behind my skull like a stave  
Containing ten hot notes and twenty hard beats  
With a rhythm I can hardly contain  
  
In the confined space between the walls of a glass  
Between lid and bottle and the start  
Of a new kind of agony, with every new seal  
  
Broken, like all my former promises  
And every pledge I made to myself  
Every confession of disorder and dedication to reform  
  
I yawn, now as I take a sip and down the final glass  
For the evening, somewhere between eleventeenth and last  
Vessel of pure poision that I cannot refuse  
  
I cannot put down this fucking, opiate glass  
This transparent demon in whose claws is clasped  
My still slowed and dulled yet raw and beating heart  
  
Whose ventricles do reject me as if I  
The lover,  donor, occupant, tumour benign  
Whose eyes claw for a new quip, pun, line  
  
To exemplify the heinous terror I describe  
Delirium tremens worms its way into my mind  
Rots away my brain until I can no longer stigmatise  
  
My actions with a sublime kind of fucked-upness   
That exists beyond the watchful, aryan eye  
Of my bastard father who drinks of this turbid swamp of mine  
  
Paris is like a faraway island, a place where there is much better wine  
For a cheaper price and a song for the throat of a singing bird  
Pardon me, sir, but I find your interjections utterly absurd  
  
What disturbed the life-long coma-like sleep I carved  
Like a cave into the street where my casing curiously parked   
Like a suburban nightmare broken down and write-off sedan car  
  
The last hour was ticking by like sand on sand  
And my gospels lies, prayers jumped from hand to hand  
To envelop the simple death I understand  
  
In an ethereal vine that god himself  
Could not force to bring forth the rose  
Once again the miserable sod revolved and in a mystery took repose

If you can't make sense of it, this might help. The poem consists of four words: a leaf falls loneliness. I actually have it tattooed on my right forearm to serve as a reminder to myself. To me, it suggests that truth can never be accurately conveyed. That meaning is lost while interpreting its representation. This is why we are alone. Each one of us is destined to experience life in solitude; our experiences are our own. I find the poem extremely comforting. I have scars on my left forearm from a suicide attempt, and people are always quick to judge after seeing them. The poem reminds me that they aren't capable of understanding - we see the world through our own minds based on our own wisdom. Their flawed perception will lead them to try to analyze me, judge me, make sense of it - but in reality on no level, to no degree, can judgment exist.

I've been on this community for a good time. I know not everyone likes structured poetry, but for those who do we know this; meter can be hard. That being said, I decided to make an app for myself so I can get better at writing metered poetry and thereby improve my rhythm. Now, I'm not going to convince you why you should write metered poetry. I've been working on this project for a while and just stayed up most of the night to finish it up. I just uploaded the android package to the Google Play store (bare with me, it takes a good few hours to become visible on the store). I'm going to take a much needed rest now, but I will be back in the afternoon and I will add the link to the application to this post.

I'm not in it for the karma - this is a self-post.

I'm not in it for the money - the application is free.

I'm in it for the poetry and to help others. The application may be up before I wake up, I tend to sleep in a bit (it's 4:39AM here right now) so by all means, feel free to check. The application is called Poetry Helper and is on the Google Play store. If you don't see it, check back here in the evening and there will be a link in this post. 

r/poetry, thanks for all your criticism and I hope that I have succeeded in giving back to the community :) I would **LOVE** suggestions, criticisms, and bug reports so that I can improve this for all who will end up using it. 

I hope everyone had a great holiday season and that y'all find this usable and enjoyable (my apologies for the poor aesthetics; I'm no graphic designer).

they could be minimalist and standardized, include the redditor's handle, or even be more personalized than that.  personally, i think just text on a white card would suffice.

there's a lot of us here...this could work.  we could start a thread and collect some of the best ones and decide what to print, and do it in a somewhat slightly organized fashion.

thoughts?

EDIT 1: Ok, so i'm talking to a good buddy of mine who works for a mom'n'pop copy shop.  we're dummying up some files to see what they look like and how many lines we could reasonably populate.  at her price we could possibly do this for 50 cents a sheet, cut to 14 3X4.5 cards.  i'll update soon.

EDIT 2: Mornin yall! She's still doing some edits.  Should have an answer today.  Meanwhile, I wanted to thank everyone for their support.  Keep a lookout, I'm going to do one more post where we figure out some of the finer details, collect some poems from the archives here and put them to vote, figure out how we'll plan to print these poems and what they'll look like (i have an idea of doing numbered ""waves"" so they become a series of sorts, and we can reprint waves regularly) and collect some more ideas and confederates.  As for paying for the printing, if they end up being this cheap I don't see why i can't just bankroll it myself, but maybe we'll collect or break that down further.

Please keep in mind, I'm playing organizer here but this thing is largely autonomous.  As some posters have mentioned, this is a pastime for some right now.  that's excellent! if you guys have any advice on how to get stuff moving that'll be great.  I have it in my head that making this more organized and unified adds an appealing consistency to it.  If you disagree and think this should be more chaotic than I'm making it out to sound please supply your opinions.  Once I have a basic proof and format (word or libreoffice document I guess?) I'll make a second PoetryBombing (PoBo?) post and let's take it from there."	t5_2qhhu	True

She took the gun, she grabbed the knife, and just like that she stopped her life.

 there are other ways, so don't be fazed, Because cutting will leave you a wreck for days.

1371355694.0	1gfrie	[Depression and Love]	virnovus	42	5	13	"*I wrote this poem a few years back, about trying to have a relationship while I'm dealing with depression.  It's the first poem I really put my heart into, because I wanted to express my emotions, and poetry seemed to be one of the best ways to do that.  It's metered and rhymes, which I think is becoming a dying art these days.  I kind of like the way it flows together, and I enjoy the challenge that's presented by meticulously selecting each word so it fits both the poem structure and the particular emotion you're trying to convey.  I'm curious as to your interpretations of it, since I was worried it might be too vague.  Like what everything means and represents.  The rhyme structure and meter are both really simple, but since this was my first serious poem, I figured there was no need to make things too complicated.  Also, the first two lines of the poem just kind of popped into my head one day, which prompted me to write the rest.  The other reason I wrote this, is that you hear a lot from people who have been in relationships with depressed people, and the toll that that can take, but you don't hear as much from the other side.*

You laugh, you sing, you dance, you fly.    
It looks so fun, I want to try.    
But as I start, that dog, jet black,    
Has seized my mind and pulled me back.    

I think I cannot take the chance,    
That he should mock my silly dance.    
I know him wrong, and make the choice,    
To disregard his jeering voice.    

We start to dance, our bodies tight,    
As I reflect your carefree light,    
And I clutch tight that foreign thought,    
That past and future mean but naught.    

My heart believes this honest lie.    
For just one beat I thought we'd fly.    
I lost what I had thought I'd found.    
We tried, but could not leave the ground.    

You cannot lift my heavy weight.    
It isn't you, it's me I hate.    
It's out of mind, but still I know.    
I try and try but can't let go.    

I wish I could remember more.    
The way you smelled, the dress you wore.

In my soul
And the lights are never off. 

There's a kitchen sink
And places for little things;
Memories of a Christmas Eve in '93. 

A Christian guy who spoke to me once
In a church that made me feel uncomfortable. 

Volley ball in the dark on the beach. 

Having trouble trying to sleep. 

There's a home 
In my soul
And the lights are never off. 

My first kiss
Was on the wrist
By a girl who shares the namesake of my Mom. 

And since I lost her
I've been an imposter
But I think this glass will give him a reason to run. 

When we called 911 because the neighbour's kid was blue
And when we visited grandma because she was, too. 

Sex on the lawn with my best friend. 

Though I didn't have one back then. 

Not knowing I'd be thinking about it 10 years later
Over and over again. 

There's a home
In my soul. 
And the lights never go off. 

It's big and it's clean
But it's messy, like me.

chokes for its life.    


An hour ago, I was lying in my bathtub  
wishing away the truth     


behind a locked door  
hands cupped to my ears      


singing lyrics to myself  
to drown      


out his shouts.  
He was threatening me with the law      


to trap my attention. He fought his hurt  
by throwing weapons my direction.      


My words cracked,  
“We live in a beautiful world. Yeah we do, yeah we do.”     


A voice cannot sing  
when it is cinched by a closing throat.     
 

I thought, it feels as though  
the rope is on the wrong side of the skin.      


Or the side right enough to keep me alive  
and wrong enough to keep me wishing I’m not.     


Death became  
my body floating in a white cloth,      


all emotions gone.  
Only gold glitter and air.      


To imagine this as a better state than real life  
is scary. Real life is scary.     


Now these tears are nothing but salt.  
Waterless, life will not be as it was.      


Life is never as it was.  
When the shackles lift,      


the ball and chain of loneliness  
lock into place.      


“Leave”, I kept screaming,  
and finally he did.      


Finally, with everything I ever hated. He left  
behind everything I’d ever want.      


Missing, I couldn’t miss him more.

We looked, we loved, and therewith instantly  
Death became terrible to you and me.  
By love we disenthralled our natural terror  
From every comfortable philosopher  
Or tall, grey doctor of divinity:  
Death stood at last in his true rank and order.  


It happened soon, so wild of heart were we,  
Exchange of gifts grew to a malady:  
Their worth rose always higher on each side  
Till there seemed nothing but ungivable pride  
That yet remained ungiven, and this degree  
Called a conclusion not to be denied.  


Then we at last bethought ourselves, made shift  
And simultaneously this final gift  
Gave: each with shaking hands unlocks  
The sinister, long, brass-bound coffin-box,  
Unwraps pure death, with such bewildernment  
As greeted our love's first accomplishment.

    [Let me explain, Love.]

    In all the words I try, 
    silent syllables divide
    the meaning from 
    the tip of tongue,
    to hide in better writers' minds.

    And every time I think: 
    “Yes! I've captured it!”
    My meter's long 
    or the rhyme is wrong;
    the ink 
            is dead and dry.

    pretending to sleep and trying not to giggle
    as you mumble to your dreams.
    And then bringing it up over cereal 
    in the morning, so we can giggle together.]

    Yet, day on day I hold
    an honest ambush of the soul,
    to shout ""Aha! 
    I have you now!""
    ensnared, 
              by words enshrined. 
    
    But definition distilled in form,
    and recognition from it born,
    are simulacrum 
    like all that comes
    from living caught in time.

    [Love is a living beast,
    like the dog eating baby bunnies
    on the lawn 
    as you cry
    and I breathlessly curse.]

    Nevertheless,
    if year by year pass by 
    as I spend them speechless,
    with you, 
              my Life, 
    know I only wait 
    to find a way 
    to bind the wordlessness 
    that's captive in your eyes.

    [Because Love is a roaring quiet,
    the white-noise t-shirt chest sound,
    drowning out the evening news,
    dawdling towards
    the murmuring warmth 
    of our winter's shared bed.]

Recently, I've met a guy who I am hoping will become my best friend. This is waiting for him in his inbox right now (it started out as just a ""good morning"" email). I haven't known him terribly long but we just seem to understand and care for each other in a way I've never before experienced with anyone. I am so happy to have him in my life.


    Already, in so little time,
    I am compelled to write you more poetry
    Than I ever felt for him

    For the boy who I professed to love,
    There were never any phrases
    At risk of spilling over,
    of flooding past my lips;

    Rushed away in the makeshift vessels 
    Of tangled, wild, and willful words;
    No desperate syllables were commandeered
    To set any frantic feelings free

    And I know your sleepy eyes
    Will float through these lines and find no place to rest
    (You'll send me edits, or a compromise
    Because you think you know how words work best)

    But that doesn't change the fact
    That this morning, I am awake and unashamed
    Waiting patiently, selfishly
    For the credit, or the blame

    Whatever these words earn me    
    Those are the wages I will take
    It is important that these things are said
    If only for honesty's sake

I wandered till I lost my way 

I roamed into a hollow tree 
and questioned where my path could be.


My life had brought me little joy, 
and Nature made me Satan's toy 

A heap of ashes was my bed. 
The Devil's home was in my head 

My knees were weak. I kissed the ground 
and prayed that Wisdom could be found. 
            
            -------

I swallowed and the world was new. 
My ravaged frame knew what to do 

I danced the dance of endless years 
and boxed the furry rabbit's ears 

The sky was Drunk! The endless sea 
was Soma's crimson canopy 

The air was gold, the land was green, 
and foolish Satan could be seen 

A hill of leaves, a window pane - 
the Prince of Demons was insane 

I said, ""Belial, I stand inside 
your empty heart: you cannot hide."" 

Said Satan: ""Poor, redundant fool, 
you're Selfish Soma's simple tool 

This echo-ridden empty hall 
is not my blessed heart at all 

Accept my eyes and you will see: 
you live inside a hollow tree!"" 

The King of Lies had spoken well. 
That tree had been my living Hell 

That lonely, weathered rotted tree - 
that prison was the world to me 

My rage had helped me burrow through, 
then Reason told me what to do 

I stood beside that lonely tree - 
that frail, hollowed effigy 

And said: “My tree has lost its roots. 
My Soul remembers tasting fruits"" 

I hacked its limbs and cleaved its head. 
I killed the fruitless sylvan Ted 

And to its bones I brought the Flame, 
and felt my Soul become the same 

I said a prayer for wasted years, 
and burned away my baseless fears 

               ------- 

So that was what I used to be, 
that lonely, weathered, hollow tree 

That blazed upon its funeral pyre: 
I was that tree - but now I'm Fire.

1325161677.0	nuuwc	A Quick Guide to Punctuation in Poetry	SetDarknessEchoing	42	7	68	"From giving feedback to people and reading submissions here, I realised that there a couple of common punctuation mistakes people are making and it would make sense to clarify a few things with a post.

Firstly, and this is the really important one that so many don't realise, just because you take a new line *does not mean* there is a pause or a break in the poem. The same goes for a new stanza, if there is no punctuation, there is no break and it just keeps being read as one sentence until there is punctuation to denote a pause or a stop.

    To prove my point I'm just typing
    out some random stuff to show you
    
    what happens when you don't use punctuation
    this is meant to be a new sentence but in reality
    because I didn't punctuate properly you had to read
    and are continuing to have to read this all as if it is
    one massively long sentence with no commas or full stops
    which it really shouldn't be
    You see sometimes people think just a capital letter is enough
    but no punctuation means no stops
    and after a while you lose the meaning behind
    your poem

Yeah I know, overly facetious, but you get the point. The best way to fix your punctuation is to read it out loud, did you pause briefly? Add a comma. Did you stop? Full stop. Did you ask a question? Question mark. 

Another point, beware the ellipsis...

Ellipses are not designed to just denote a pause in speech, [these are its uses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis).

1.  Denote the omission of a word or phrase
2.  Indicate an unfinished thought, or trailing off into nothing
3.  Inspire a feeling of melancholy longing

Just be careful then to use them sparingly. Punctuation to denote an unfinished thought and/or a feeling of melancholy is a priceless tool in poetry, but like all other effects it should be used in moderation and when it is technically viable. If you use an ellipsis, then go on later in the poem to finish your thought, go back and change it to a full stop, comma or even an em dash.

Lastly, I should note briefly stylistic omission of punctuation.There is indeed a school of poets who remove all punctuation for stylistic effect, many of which I love (E.E Cummings for example). Remember however, once you start removing punctuation for stylistic effect, you need to take your form, diction and syntax up a gear. It's not enough to write a poem then go through and remove all the commas and such. The whole design of the poem (from the very start of the writing of it) needs to be fitted around the removal of punctuation. 

Take this [classic example](http://www.internal.org/e_e_cummings/Buffalo_Bills). Note how he forces the words 'onetwothreefourfive' together then 'pigeonsjustlikethat'. He is forcing you to speed up, say something very quickly, then slow back down. This creates the effect of punctuation without actually using it, almost like punctuation in reverse.

I know this is a lot for just one post but it should give people something to think about when writing their next piece hopefully. If anyone has anything else to add, or wants to vehemently disagree with me, don't hesitate to do so below! Thanks.

1356134205.0	1596tu	Twas the week before Christmas and all through the store.... [retail humor/NSFW language]		46	15	2	"‘Twas the week before Christmas, when all through the store

Everyone was insane, and the shoppers did roar

The displays were ransacked and sales out of stock

Cashiers were praying to be bashed by a rock

The dairy crew hid in their coolers in fear

While visions of eggnog made them shed a lone tear

And meat in their coats, and deli in their caps,

Had just revved up for a week of time and half

When out on the floor there arose such a clatter,

Management left the back to see what was the matter.

Away from my smoke break, I flew like a flash

Walked out on the floor and dealt with the backlash.

The fluorescent lights shined down on the insane;

I wanted to scream something vile and profane.

When what to my wondering eyes should appear,

But a train full of carts and eight cases of beer,

With a little old driver, so slow and so drunk,

My day would be ruined, my heart would be sunk.

His questions all sought me like moths to a flame,

He whistled and shouted and called me “shit-stain.”

“Now bastard, now faggot, fudge-packer and queer!

Show me the baking soda; were you raised by a steer?!

To the top of the case! To the back of the freezer!

Get me this! I want that! Oh, just give me a teaser!”

As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,

His demands became crazy: the chicken must fry.

So up to the backroom the employees, they flew,

As they read his demands, they sighed, “I need a brew!”

And then in a twinkling, I heard over the comm,

“SALE ON CHRISTMAS HAM! THIS DEAL IS THE BOMB!”

As I drew in my head and was turning around,

‘Cross the store the nuts came with a leap and a bound.

They were all dressed like shit, from their head to their shoe,

Clothes crusted completely with mustard and spew.

A bundle of deals they had flung in their carts,

Eyes crazy and wild, breath smelling of farts.

Their eyes looked so dead! Their spirits wore thin!

They fought like wild dogs as they dug through the bin!

Bakery put out cakes draped with ribbon and bow,

But those soon became trampled like the fresh-fallen snow.

The CSM watched and then sobbed from the front,

As the store was destroyed by a cruel, little runt.

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.

He was chubby and plump, a mean little child,

And he laughed when we saw all that he had defiled.

A twitch in my eye, a pounding in my head,

Stupid liberal laws, he had nothing to dread!

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work.

Destroying the store, the devilish little jerk.

And laying his finger aside of my nose,

I just couldn’t wait, for the store would soon close.

He sprang to his mother as she paid for her food,

I wanted to yell, “MIND YOUR KID! SO DAMN RUDE!”

When his mom turned away, I leaned over his meal,

And said ever so softly that “Santa isn’t real.”"	t5_2qhhu	True

Any more, black shoe

In which I have lived like a foot

For thirty years, poor and white,

Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

.

Daddy, I have had to kill you.

You died before I had time--

Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,

Ghastly statue with one gray toe

Big as a Frisco seal

.

And a head in the freakish Atlantic

Where it pours bean green over blue

In the waters off beautiful Nauset.

I used to pray to recover you.

Ach, du.

.

In the German tongue, in the Polish town

Scraped flat by the roller

Of wars, wars, wars.

But the name of the town is common.

My Polack friend

Says there are a dozen or two.

So I never could tell where you

Put your foot, your root,

I never could talk to you.

The tongue stuck in my jaw.

.

It stuck in a barb wire snare.

Ich, ich, ich, ich,

I could hardly speak.

I thought every German was you.

And the language obscene

.

An engine, an engine

Chuffing me off like a Jew.

A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.

I began to talk like a Jew.

I think I may well be a Jew.

The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna

Are not very pure or true.

With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck

And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack

I may be a bit of a Jew.

I have always been scared of you,

With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.

And your neat mustache

And your Aryan eye, bright blue.

Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You-- 

.

Not God but a swastika

So black no sky could squeak through.

Every woman adores a Fascist,

The boot in the face, the brute

Brute heart of a brute like you.

.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy,

In the picture I have of you,

A cleft in your chin instead of your foot

But no less a devil for that, no not 

Any less the black man who

.

Bit my pretty red heart in two.

I was ten when they buried you.

At twenty I tried to die

And get back, back, back to you.

I thought even the bones would do.

.

But they pulled me out of the sack,

And they stuck me together with glue.

And then I knew what to do.

I made a model of you,

A man in black with a Meinkampf look

.

And a love of the rack and the screw.

And I said I do, I do.

So daddy, I'm finally through.

The black telephone's off at the root,

The voices just can't worm through.

.

If I've killed one man, I've killed two--

The vampire who said he was you

And drank my blood for a year,

Seven years, if you want to know.

Daddy, you can lie back now.

.


There's a stake in your fat black heart

And the villagers never liked you.

They are dancing and stamping on you.

They always knew it was you.

Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.

[What Would It Be Like To Fade Away]

What would it be like to fade away?

Like sand stained dark in a tidal bay.

A footprint leaves its mark and name. 

Like those scratched onto a lonesome grave.

Forgotten, for it is dried the next day.

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like when love is gone?

When life has been lived for far to long.

When you cant remember a name or face.

But try with the hope to retain your grace.

Cause you survived, and they rest in lawns.

What would it be like when love is gone?


What would it be like to fade away?

Not be here tomorrow to see another day.

Nor feel the suns comforting embrace. 

Like warm tears upon your face.

The wait is dark and I’m afraid.

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like to say goodbye?

Knowing it might be for the last time.

Tomorrow will be remembered for when I died.

Not leaving anything dear behind

I leave childless and without a bride.

What would it be like to say goodbye?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the toll of bells when there is no more sway

Silent and unheard with no more strain

The hammer won’t strike to cause them pain

They are at easy if only for an hour or day

What would it be like to fade away?

What would it be like without this weight?

Could it be my whole life would dilate?

I feel as though I don’t have the traits 

To be among those who pass the cut rate

How many times do I need to reiterate

What would it be like with out this weight?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the beauty of a dying bouquet.

Not like the bells whom endure their pain.

It cannot be washed away with rain.

I once tried to say goodbye 

It came at the end of a string tie

There is no name that bares my lace

When time runs out ill loose all face

My crime was life, I feel as a slave

No one tends to the lonesome grave

Unlike the footprint gone the next day

Do I need permission so that I may

Find out what it is like to fade away.

You know Poe wrote somewhere dark.
Maybe Saint Peter wrote in the light.
Martin Luther King Jr. behind bars and

You can write or type, cigarette in hand and feel like the people need to hear whatever you have to say.
So I'll swear like the Devil in a chair there next to me.
The Devil of hell where the soul of the sinner dwells.
The Devil, trying to write an apology to God but can't, because maybe his nature won't let him.
So the Devil writes by the lights of the fire that burn him again and again.
""I'm sorry. I'm sorry and I will never damn humanity like I did back then.""
Over and over and over again because before he can send it, it turns to ash but he keeps trying because
What has the Devil got to lose?

The idea of a dazy-hazy room, in a big leather chair with my hand around the throat of a pen as it spits out words that leap in my chest like a man that dives into love because ""Falling"" into it sounds accidental.
My pen spits words out and I haven't asked it why, but if you ask me?
My pen has a crush on paper and would give black blood just to give it meaning.
It records everything I write but promises not to testify against me in the court of trial and error.
So if I find myself in that limbo, a dim room filled with the toke of vanilla pipe smoke and the taste of liquor I couldn't stomach, I would feel as fine as the wine inside of me.
A place for the soul with words to throw but no ears to catch them.

But if my mother found myself in a hazy-dazy, dim room she would just as soon wrap her little hands around my neck while I choked and wrote with my pen over and over and over again,

        quivering and filthy from atmospheric dust
    and he was crying because his wings were stripped
        of their feathers by the free fall
    and he had black hair and broad hands and he knew he
        was beautiful naked
    and he was too sad to show off his good looks because
        he had two featherless stumps on his back
    and I told him you’re not going anywhere
        anytime soon
    and we’re the only people on this island
        so you have no where to go
    and so he realized that even angels can be trapped
        so he said he would stay with me
    and so we swam in the surf on mornings when the sky
        was the same color as the cliffs
    and so cold was the water in which we swam
        so salty was the water in which we swam
    and so rough was the water in which we swam
        when it scraped our legs with silt
    and in the evenings storms passed
        over the cliffs
    and rain would have drilled holes in the roofs of
        other houses. but not our roof because it is strong
    and reinforced with heartstrings woven into fabric
        like a tarpaulin that can only ever be made by two desperates
    and it was during these evenings when I corrupted the angel
        with gooseberry wine and bread ground from barley
    and I forced him to dance the zeybek while I laughed
        feeling the bowl of the baglama filling the void in my pelvis
    and I forced him to drink the entire jug of gooseberry wine
        while singing backwards prayers
    and afterwards we made love on the bed he fell into
        so many years ago
    and as I thrust in and out, I grabbed the stumps
        where his wings used to be
    and he came to a climax
        as I sucked his stumps
    and he cried because he knew that someday
        his wings would grow back
    and he would never
        feel that again

2:30 in the morning, she appeared in my sight



I knew in an instant that I liked her coy smile



Such a feeling I hadn’t felt in quite a while!

We exchanged correspondence in the weeks to come



I became infatuated; or as they say: “Struck dumb.”



The similarities we have are truly a myriad



We’d even read the same books: Eragon, Game of Thrones, and the Iliad. 

I had to see her, come hell or high water,



I couldn’t dawdle, dither, or dodder.  



So I flew like the wind towards NC’s coast,



And of that weekend, we made the most.

There was a moment when I had a big fright



My only recourse was to be totally contrite.



I thought I had ruined it, I had a big scare,



When I kissed her lips gently, then spit gum in her hair.

He wrote a poem

And he called it ""chops""

Because that was the name of his dog

And thats what it was all about

His teacher gave him an A

And a gold star

And his mother hung it on the kitchen door

And read it to his aunts.

That was the year Father Tracy

Took all the kids to the zoo

And he let them sing on the bus

And his little sister was born

With tiny nails and no hair

And his mother and father kissed a lot

And the girl around the corner sent him a

Valentine signed with a row of X's

And he had to ask his father what the X's meant

And his father always tucked him in bed at night

And was always there to do it
 
Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines

He wrote a poem

He called it ""Autumn""

Because that was the name of the season

And that's what it was all about

And his teacher gave him an A

And asked him to write more clearly

And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door

Because of the new paint

And the kids told him

That Father Tracy smoked cigars

And left butts on the pews

And sometime they would burn holes

That was the year his sister got glasses

With thick lenses and black frames

And the girl around the corner laughed

When he asked her to go see Santa Claus

And the kids told him why

His mother and father kissed a lot

And his father never tucked him in bed at night

And his father got mad

When he cried for him to do it
 
Once on a paper torn from his notebook

He wrote a poem

And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""

Because that was the question about his girl

And thats what it was all about

And his professor gave him an A

And a strange steady look

And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door

Because he never showed her

That was the year Father Tracy died

And he forgot how the end

Of the Apostles's Creed went

And he caught his sister

Making out on the back porch

And his mother and father never kissed

Or even talked

And the girl around the corner

Wore too much make up

That made him cough when he kissed her

But he kissed her anyway

Because it was the thing to do

And at 3 am he tucked himself into bed

His father snoring soundly
 

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag

He tried another poem

And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""

Because that's what it was really all about

And he gave himself an A

And a slash on each damned wrist

And he hung it on the bathroom door

Because this time he didn’t think

He could reach the kitchen

**Time**

Time is an essence, subject to the mind

Relative to all, both mortal and divine

Measured in sands or hands on a clock

It’s a burden and a blessing that Time never stops

These sands of Time, we’re subject to

Have no love or hate, for me or you

Time wears us down, until we break

And when we’re broken, our lives it takes

Merciless, it steals our looks and our youth

We can’t deny it, this harsher truth

Allah or Ra, they’re one and the same

We all call him God, but Time’s his real name

Time may heal our wounds, and keeps us alive

But in the end it decides to end our lives

Time affects the skies and deserts alike

Wastes away mountains, takes away the sun’s light

A blessing or curse, this thing we call Time

It tears us down in body and mind

Whether we’re here by mistake or here by design

We don’t answer to God, we answer to Time.

    But did not think to give what made him great—
    His poet's tongue and his lover's heart.
     
    My father was a great lover, by all accounts;
    He spread his love as freely as his seed
    And gave up its fruits with cold abandon.
     
    I had no more a place in his heart than a place at his side.
    I was not his glorious boy, or a natural son worth writing to,
    Merely a sickly girl with his devils in my blood.
     
    My mother carved arithmetic into my skull as an exorcism
    Until every creak of the floorboards beneath the carpet
    And every gust of wind through the branches became a whisper of numbers,
    A simple equation that never added up. 
     
    He did not leave me his heart,
    But instead his ghost settled in mine.
     
    My father's vanities sharpened my coarse tongue, made it a weapon.
    They could slip rings on my fingers and call me a lady,
    But I would never be so proud as when I heard the whispers
    Of how my wicked mouth had the same curve as his.
     
    I had no place in his heart but a place by his deathbed is enough.
    We will lie side by side in the soil beneath the bells,
    Counting the tolls to thirty-six; a number I shall share with him

Then her pretty little face turned awfully grim.

    For his innocence he slew to feed his curiosity.

    He is the cartographer of Hell; the emissary of Heaven. 
    At home in all the worlds but his own. 
    Friend of the gods, enemy of Man;

    For where Man fears to look, 
    He looks. 
    What Man fears to question, 
    He questions. 
    What Man fears to doubt, 
    He doubts.

    And so they fear him-
    As well they should; 
    For they know what dangers The Philosopher hath wrought in the past; 
    Know what the Shards of Eternity, 
    Dredged from the Abyss, 
    Can do in the hands of Man.

    More beast, and more machine. 
    More demonic, and more divine. 
    More reasoned, and more insane.

1. Is the first line interesting and immediate?
2. Is the poem confused or obscure in some places?
3. Does the poem contain unnecessary words, phrases, details?
4. Are the line breaks used effectively?
5. Is the poem in the most effective order?
6. Are there unwarranted connotations in the images or phrases that might throw the reader off track?
7. Is the poem so overloaded with abstractions that the reader has to supply his or her own stock responses, and the poem has no life of its own?
8. Does the poem contain cliches that don't work in a new way?
9. Does it 'show' through crisp, fresh images?
10. Can you hear the music of the poem, or is it flat and lacking in musicality so that it seems like prose broken into lines?
11. Is its language  striking and fresh, or drab and routine?
12. Are the verbs charged, or do forms of the verb 'to be' predominate? Is the passive voice used too much?
13. Does the poem truly say something in a new way, or do you (the writer) simply imagine that it does?

When the World ends, 




And the bombs have exploded,




And all is said and done, 




Maybe there will be wildflowers.

Asked the little boy to the old man. 




“Yes,” he replied. 




“But we’ll come back”




“Humans are resilient like that.”





An invasive species works its way




Through the cracks 




And doesn’t stop until it has 




Completely




No,




Insidiously,




Wresting, usurping, changing,  




Made itself home. 





Don’t we know where we’ve come from?




Isn’t that how it always works?




When will we ever realize that history 




Is a record that winds down until there




Is nothing but static and pop until 




Someone flips it over?





Maybe in the quiet of our own self-destruction, 




When nothing is left but embers and regret, 




There will still be wildflowers, 




And a new invasive species will slowly take hold.

    Taking Flight

    For Erica Belius
   
    i.
    
    6-am cicadas croon on your windowsill 
    and two heads of hair knot on your pillow.
    
    There’s something wrong with the shadow 
    on the bed: morning light bends 
    toward you from the steel in his hand. 
    You’re not sure if he’s grabbing 
    back your hair or hers—
    
    Until she shrieks through teeth
    that could be yours. Wings 
    burst out red onto the white sheets—

    Your twin sister’s voice is a bell in your head. 
    You stumble for help, but she’s already ringing: 
    too late, too late.

    ii.

    You wade through sun-broken grass
    in velvet, holding your mother’s hand.

    Flies in black mourning clothes 
    circle above your house 
    calling Gloria, Gloria.

    They welcome your sister. Buzzed, they sing.

    Child, six years old, you don’t know this yet 
    of angels: even the cicada must leave 
    its body behind to fly away.

    In memory of Lauren Belius September 16, 2004 – July 19, 2011




So, a big congratulations to Superciliary! 

I must add, I couldn't believe the number of entries! There was a fantastic response from the community for this contest, as such, poetry competitions will become a much more prominent feature on this subreddit. I think the next step is to start making each competition more defined, for example, one for specific forms (e.g. Sonnets, Free Verse etc), one for poems about specific subjects and potentially a Performance Poetry contest (we'd need someone qualified to judge that however, I don't have the expertise, I'll look into seeing if I can pull in a friend or if anyone else feels qualified message me). Let me know below of any ideas you have regarding future competitions!


Notes on the judging (for those who are interested)-

I read all entries thoroughly before creating a shortlist. The poems on this list were then judged by two other poets/critics who each selected a top two from the list (this was to remove as much judging bias as possible, because let's face it, we all have subjective preferences). The top two poems selected by each of us were then brought together and analysed between the three of us before deciding on a winner.

The standard of the poetry submitted was also to a high level everyone, so I sincerely hope you all continue to submit to the community and definitely keep submitting to any competitions that are being ran. Thanks to everyone who made this possible and as always, good luck with your future poetic endeavours!

    Folding and unfolding a brief moment so many times
    the photograph has become warped and
    I don’t know what it looked like in the first place
     
    Our most recent meeting was a melancholy affair
    Filled with laughter and knowing silence
    I looked across the table at a young woman
    I never actually understood

    Two dots on a map that only ever knew distance
    Growing separately, independently until
    tattered memory was all that remained
    but it’s going to be okay.
     
    See, I went for a walk last night and
    Loved every minute of it.
    The moon off set the bracing cold
    With an alluring grace
    
    I only thought of you twice:
    Once when two people laughed distantly
    And again when the noise settled.
    I hoped that you were happy wherever you were

    We all have dreams that never see any light
    That's one of those hard facts of life
    And I am white-knuckled, like a vice grip that's 
    learning how to let go. Slowly, slowly.

I move to brush your hair from my shoulder, but it’s just the warm breeze’s kiss from the open window.  Every thought of you is more vivid than the one before.  Insecurity churns the pit of my stomach, and I wonder what you’re doing, and who you’re doing it with.  You’ve done nothing to make me wonder that, it’s just my malfunction. My breathing grows shorter; I’m being suffocated by my own irrationality.  I hate that I haven’t grown out of that.  I’m supposed to have grown out of that.  Fuck the old saying.

with  

Woodrow   
 Wilson

  in my mouth

-------------
  
--------------------------------------

Earlier  
that afternoon,  
He saw me waiting   
at the bus stop  
on division,  
and  
he knew  
 i wasn't   
waiting for a  
second  
chance.  

--------------------------------------
He knew that i wasn't  
waiting for morning.    

And, he knew   
that at  
  
the sound of caged  
 animals i  would take   
off running for  
wisdom and  
 truth.  

--------------------------------------
He knew that at  
  
the sound of gun  
shots  
 i   
dropped  
dimes   
like lit cigarettes on   
those swollen old   
  
Children.  

--------------------------------------------

And when one shoe  
fell off  
the Halsted   
bridge he knew  
that   
  
i wouldn't be going   
down   
  
after it.  

--------------------------------------
He knew the  
antinomy  
of saints, is not  
what kept me glued  
to my seat.   
  
  
It was the  
notion that time  
stopped  
when i turned off  
my eyes.  
  
------------------------------------
It was  
when i found out  
that his truth,  

was filled with venom  
  
that  
I began to look  
past the atrophy of  
democracy.  
  
--------------------------------------
And I fell asleep  
in the midst  
 of buying groceries.
  

And his  
Children will cry   
forever,  
waiting for me to   
bring them candy  
and plastic.

His Children,  
will cry forever, with  
their boiled  
stomachs  
  
hang  -
ing out  
(At arms length)  
 Waiting for Legions  
 and equity

Waiting for  
mix drinks  

and billiard balls in  
the   
  
glory-hole back  
  
rooms  
  
of catholicism.  

--------------------------------------
Each one of  
his Children   
turned to granite.  
  
at the first sign   
  
of Java Script.  And i  
held their hand, as  
they uploaded  
pictures of mirrors.  

--------------------------------------

But then i let go of  
their hand  
when i  
saw  
  
that those Children be  
came grownups at the  
  
first sign of mitigating  
  
circumstance.

----------------------------------------
It wasn't a dis  
ease that  
set me free.  
  
It was  
the irony  
i let go of.  
  
It was  
a landfill  
that i fell in love with.  

--------------------------------------
  
it was a tire iron, and  
a mail box that sent  
  
my wisdom through  
dream states of ivory  
  
silence.  
  
It was his Child, i let  
fall off that bridge.

It was a  
shoe i let walk  
 away,  
  
 and it was  
  
He who.  
watched,  
  
  
as i slept.

I didn't think of,



And yesterday I rode the bus

out of pure lonliness;

I rode into the city to look at the lights

And I took pictures of the lights that

were lonelier than I was.

I planned on telling anyone who asked

that I wasn't from around here

Which is sort of true. No one asked.

And when I realized the pictures

were just okay,

I thought maybe my poems were too.

And either way,

It's not my fault if they're good or bad, or just okay.


Some bums passed by me on the bridge, not knowing or caring.

And they had their bum lives and bags,

filled with whatever they were filled with.

It was a lot like the word - sonder

Which is a good word that's just overused, like saying something

has been beaten like a dead horse.

But not too long ago I told about it

to a girl I really like, and she seemed to like it.

       cried at once in wordless angst

       So as I sat, clutching my cold coffee

His heart had holes,

He thought of his life,

one he could do without.

His heart grew dry,

and began to split with cracks.

He lost himself;

could he never go back?

But his heart hurt too much; 

he had to take control. 

So he thought of the things 

that made his heart whole. 

Then he closed his eyes, 

took a big leap of faith... 

And ended up on the other side safe. 

His heart opened up, 

and he took off his shell, 

and he said with a smile, 

'I made it through hell.' 

And he urged all the others

to take the same chance. 

And some did, and they made it, 

and they smiled and danced. 

So happy was he, 

to beat back his mask. 

And so proud was he,

Amongst the darkest coral spires,

In murky, dank and rotting mires,

A world of fierce aquatic liars,

Of thieves, and cheats and law defiers,

A catfish shouts, a dogfish barks,

A beaten trout, by loan-shark sharks,

A ratfish squeals, he tells, he blabs,

The slut-fish gives the man-fish crabs,

The underworld of undersea,

Where crime and brine entwine with glee,

Then find their minds combined and freed,

By hydroponic-kind sea-weed,

The only schools you’ll find don’t teach,

They bully whales up onto beach,

A cruellest rule of a sorry sea,

Devoid of all authority,

Mermaid hookers deck the corn’,

They yawn and mourn the ocean dawn, 

Against the backlit shops, adorned,

With porn and prawn, regret and scorn,

The octopi, with tendrils, clench,

A screaming, squirming octo-wench,

They ink her face with blackened stench,

Her grave; the Mariana Trench,

The Killer Whale is born to kill,

He spares no time for fucking krill,

He lusts for flesh before it’s stale,

He’s not some fucking soft-cunt whale,

He goes to where the tuna be,

And live and play and chew the reed,

He’ll seize the Orca-tunity,

To feed his greed while tuna bleed,

Anemone play violent pimp,

To teenage, nearly naked shrimp,

While coward dolphins dive for air,

It seems they feel much safer there,

The land; it’s such a safer bet,

“We’ve sure evolved to walking yet?”

So sick of crime and fear and wet,

And porn and prawn and scorched regret,

A nurse shark slips prescription drugs,

To starving, mad, ecstatic bugs,

The stingray scrounge the silty depths,

Jacked up on coke and crystal meth,

A swim-by-sting, a family torn.

In Flounder's Field, a thousand morn,

But one each hour, a sea-fiend's born,

In coral spiked like devil's horn,

In this cruel world of fish and prawn,

And death and crime, and lust forlorn,

And hate and fear and dust and scorn,

""Do all to stay away!"" they warn,

From porn and prawn, regret and scorn,

And porn and prawn, regret and scorn.

The eve before Salvation's dawn,

Will reek of porn, but mostly prawn.

You start with very plainly describing something a place, an object, whatever you want. Then you add some adjectives. Then you replace them with other adjectives. Then change words until you are satisfied with what you have written. Here is an example from the first time I tried it. 

Starting sentence:  I can see out the window. I can only see the sky and a small bush. It looks like it is going to rain.

Slightly edited: I can see out the clear window. I can see the gloomy sky and a newly planted shrub. It appears rain is approaching.

Final product:The sky is sad, free of light. Bleak clouds fill the heavens as the young shrub awaits the cool rain.

**On a day like any other….**

On a day like any other,  
they two wait like beetles   
in the dark,  
for the light,  
so that scuttling, they can  
seek the dark, to wait again.  

She would welcome death - his!  
And so would he.  
Instead he milks her breast of scorn  
and wants his pillow fluffed,  
dark stained and damp  
with ancient tears.  

On a day like any other,  
she bellows broad  
the aching of their days,  
charging strangers dear   
with uttered pain for sympathy.  

No friend in this small house,  
none, not one to see  
the apparatus of a dying man,  
hid well in drawers  
and capsuled dreams.  

On a day like any other,  
he lies unfinished,  
a cankered doll, limp  
and lost, discarded,  
but for she who tears his ears  
and pokes his eyes  
seeking his mortality.  

On a day like any other....

**The Bird**

A bird flew into my life with a thud  
and died.  

The window, though clear, was hard  
unyielding, deadly.

At my desk with thoughts diffuse  
it broke into my life  
with its neck.  

It fell on impact, tried to stand  
and fell again, dazed then dead.  

It was warm, soft and beautiful  
and dead in a bloody pool.  

I buried it under the bottlebrush.   
When it flowers in spring  
 and the honey eaters come  
 to feed on the sweetness  
 of the flowers.  
I will remember the death.  
I know that I will.

and in the brightness of her face,    
and in her soft and simple grace,    
I found a truly gorgeous space.    

And there I basked in the sweet glow    
of beauty I'd just come to know;    
completely caught up in the flow    
of new life bright as white is snow.    

But, of me, she began to tire,    
and soon our bond came to expire,    
and so she left; my sole supplier    
of life-transforming, warming fire.    

I try so hard now to erase

and image of her shining face,    
and aura of her gentle grace.    
I try so hard but can't efface;    
I try so hard but can't displace,    
not even one damned single trace    
of how she filled that sacred space.    

The world is dark without her light,    
my brightest day has turned to night,    
her memory's a constant plight;    
a burden I've no strength to fight.    
Now if that burden would ignite,    
the fiery blaze would reach great height,    
from brilliant flames, dark would take flight,    
sunlight'd, at last, be cast so bright.    

But it's no chance of catching fire,    
no matter how much I desire,    
A phoenix's rebirth won't transpire,    
instead, that burden binds like wire.    

Not one star shines, the moon is new,    
and luminance my soul lacks too.    
Moments of peace I have are few,    
and my stay here is far from through.    

Now I explore depths of my mind,    
in hope that, someday, I will find    
what continues in me to bind    
to those that I must leave behind.

With fresh-cut grass,
Under the lights,
The field was truth,

From first to ninth,
Wrists wrapped in tape,
Between the lines,

As kids we grew.

And as men- as men-  as men we wait…

In the stands for the first time,
You all alone between the lines,
One swing left- you never missed,
Down one- two outs- three balls- two strikes,

Basically, hard times struck my life, and to deal with it, I started writing poetry. Eventually I created a poetic form which helped me deal with and nurture my troubled mind.

Reddit, I present to you the Andreanic poem, this is what it is:

A poem written in two columns, the reader reads the first column, then the second - **but** the columns are aligned so the reader can read the two columns as *one column.* This means the reader can read line 1 of column one, then line 1 of column 2, then line 2 of column one and line 2 of column two etc...

Writing and reading these poems has created an experience that has changed my life. The purpose of it is to create two stories, which, when read together, change everything. I have still not mastered it - but I wanted to share.

Now, for you to see first hand what this is all about, you can read my prototype poem here (you're going to have to zoom in):

https://docs.google.com/file/d/1zIESP9LMTs4W-Gh0mnRrfCq7LXNGsDSczjHSKFDpyMwWX8hUoKO-RsXBsHEs/edit?usp=sharing

The rules are simple, each person can submit ONE poem which should be MESSAGED to me (i.e. Don't put your poetry in a comment). Anything being entered should be CLEARLY MARKED as such so I know you are entering for the competition (lots of people are mailing me their own work for feedback so I don't want to mix them up. A small line at the top will suffice).

Entries can be any length, however, if you are entering something between 1-3 lines (i.e. a one line poem or a Haiku) you can enter up to THREE (of the same form) provided they are all connected by a similar theme (and yes, they should all be in the same message). Otherwise, ONE poem only.

Winner will be announced at the start of January in three ways. 1. An Edit in this original post 2. A comment in this post and 3. A new post so everyone can see how marvelous you are! The name of the poet AND the poem will also be included.

I know the short window means a lot of our brightest and best might not see this, but I will hold small competitions on a monthly or bi-monthly basis if there is enough interest.

P.s. Yes, you can use poetry you have already posted but i would advise you to take any feedback you have received into account and edit it before submission. Deadline is New Years Eve i.e. 31st December.

Upvote and comment below so as many people as possible have a chance to see this and the best of luck to everyone!

The wearisome day ending  
I think of my life so far  
the paths I've taken  
the paths I've yet to take  
the people I've met,and the people I've yet to meet.  
But as the ink dries on the paper,I think of you.  




Your blue eyes  
your cherubic lips,  
skin like ivory, and just as precious,  
your aura of confidence,  
though mixed with a vulnerable femininity,  
drove me crazy,  
made my head go hazy.
I could not think straight    
with you on my mind.  




Words cannot describe  
the way I feel about you  
but still I attempt.  
My feelings are fathoms deeper than that  
of the ocean blue,  
Warmer than the surface of the sun itself  
and truer, than any words  
That man has ever spoken.

The way you make me feel  
makes my heart beats faster  
than any beat of a drum  
you make me feel higher  
than any bird can fly.  




Let every word in this poem be like notes of music,  
each one different, unique, but filling your soul,  
let every verse be like a kiss,  
though one I cannot give,   
but setting your inner passions alight.  




Till I see your face again,  
Do not lose your beauty;  
Those deep blue eyes,more beautiful than the vast sea  
Its hue, unique to you.  
nor your smile, shall it never age,  
or your vibrance, do not allow it to dim  




So here the long goodbye,  
parting ways, in uncounted days.  
I finish with a kiss that i cannot give,  
forgive me for my mistakes,  
I hope to leave only good memories,  
Of affection, and good times we had  
While I reminisce on what was lost,   
and what was to be,     
live your life full of bliss,  
enjoy every moment,  
a life blessed with fulfillment.

(translated from the original Spanish)    
by matthagen

It is a scientific fact that there are beautiful women everywhere you turn.    
Over every bite of lunch alone in the 2nd story's food-court.    

Women who, given a smaller, or more resource-depleted population    
would have deserved jousts.    

Women lonelier than I am who are doing everything right, but have no one    
to tell them. They deserve someone to tell them    

the tie in their hair is done just right, and yes you have    
put on just the right amount of blush today. Your jeans look great.    

Ill-tasting Rainbow Grasshoppers stepping out from the between the casavas    
sing the epics on their legs for the woman who asked for extra tomatoes.    

A man should kill his brother for the woman ordering iced tea with easy ice.    
Women whose faces could never have been fastened to Italian stone,    

every figure the same rounded egg with blonded braids,    
so that when the maestro finally beheld her in his studio, no color seemed fair.    

Women who are trapped in their museums and libraries where an occasional admirer    
might whisper approval through the mouthpiece of a telephone,    

and I, with a Venus who calls me hers waiting at my own home,    
what should be a castle, and is instead a thousand square feet of mostly utility closet,    

think that it could be me who would greet, extoll and leave    
them untouched to process the appreciation that their effort is spent to receive    

like a purple and yellow insect who has developed no poison as a defense    
standing up on a rock to announce itself to a desert floor -    

an evolutionary hiccup of a squire, who is certain the sword is his    
but finds himself eviscerated on a mead-hall dance-floor    

like when I was 8 years old and a loose shoe-lace snagged in my bike-chain    
sending me to the asphalt cheek-bone first,    

but the insect that other eaten generations have made me is not purple and yellow.    
I am an unnoticable shade of brown with pink highlights,    

easy to lose in the rocks and dunes, and these women, whose figures will    
never grace mountainfaces, must, today, let science sleep in the bed it has made.

It's good that I didn't call   
Good that I didn't say too much.    

Some things are hard to give up    
Sometimes it's hard to let go    
But I'm giving up
All sorts of things, now.    

I don't drive anymore    
And I don't eat that much    
But I do smoke a lot more    
Cigarettes and drink    
Beer.    
But I always drank    
Plenty of beer.    

I imagine I'm some sort of    
Drinking smoking monk    
Living in the kind of solitude    
You get when you unplug    
And quit calling.   

I gave up television    
Except for Back to the Future reruns.    
Instead I read old books    
I try to make notes in the margins.    

I haven't written any music    
In a long time. My guitars    
Are neglected, broken-stringed.    

It's been a month since we spoke    
And I don't want to talk to you    
But I would like to know    
that you miss me.    

I don't miss you.    
I gave up missing you weeks ago    
When I washed your perfume     
Out of my pillowcases     
Exorcised your lingering ghosts.     

Every time I clean I find something    
A relic    
A stupid rubber wristband    
That fell behind the bed     
Or a ponytail holder    
Underneath my journal.    

Sequins keep showing up.    
I pick them out of the carpet    
and a few days later    
Find another.    

Something tells me    
Memories are like waves    
And mine are stirring the floor    
And washing these bits of you up    
Pushing them out of the ocean of our yesterdays   
And onto my little bit of shore.    

Sunday night (after I drank too much)    
I found five sequins    
and held them all in my palm.    
They were a constellation    
Shaped like summer    
Like days laying out at the lake    
And nights when we couldn't cool off    
After we made love    
Spread out on the bed    
The air wafting in from the window    
Barely a whisper    
The smell of your sex   
And the taste of your sweat   
Lingering on my lips.

I looked at them too long    
Thought of you too much    
Came too close to dialing your number.    

That was as much of you    
As I'd held    
Since you left    
And when I held my hand    
Over the trash    
It was hard to let go.    "	t5_2qhhu	True

   And the trees have a silver glare;   
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,   
   And the harpies of upper air,   
   That flutter and laugh and stare.  

For the village dead to the moon outspread   
   Never shone in the sunset's gleam,   
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep   
   Where the rivers of madness stream   
   Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.  
  
A chill wind blows through the rows of sheaves   
   In the meadows that shimmer pale,   
And comes to twine where the headstones shine   
   And the ghouls of the churchyard wail   
   For harvests that fly and fail.  

Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change   
   That tore from the past its own   
Can quicken this hour, when a spectral power   
   Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne,   
   And looses the vast unknown.  

So here again stretch the vale and plain   
   That moons long-forgotten saw,   
And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,   
   Sprung out of the tomb's black maw   
   To shake all the world with awe.  

And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,   
   The ugliness and the pest   
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,   
   Shall some day be with the rest,   
   And brood with the shades unblest.  

Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,   
   And the leprous spires ascend;   
For new and old alike in the fold   
   Of horror and death are penned,

Dudro	33	10	8	"The three of us thought of key words to write around and shared them for the other poet to use as their inspiration.  Can't say we've done any of this before, but I'm happy with the results.

Poet 1:

Motion

    Narrow it down to the relativity, even 
    Conscious of the extraordinarily vast periphery,
    It's hard to fathom.
    Delay the slow onset realizations, 
    of your muscles sensations,
    and take a good, hard look at that chasm.
    It's a strange notion.
    All that 
    motion.

Masturbation

    Some nights,
    While I lay in bed,
    in fact, most days.
    Well, anytime I'm bored out of my head.
    I'll do a quick one two, check check test.
    As if I was performing.
    Just to see if anyone is home, 
    or they're all deep at rest.
    And of course, I'm not really about to perform.
    It's more like training,
    if training can include watching porn.

Poison

    One poison
    Two poison
    I'm getting cozy.
    Inhale deeply into my lungs,
    Wash it down with a little rum.
    Three poison 
    Four poison
    Now I'm feeling fuckin' toasty,
    and I'm getting a little aggressive with my language, 
    but once you get the hang of it,
    it flows a little more smoothly, and even though 
    I'm feeling a little woozy,
    my thoughts are like the ice in a bucket,
    and my words the fine wine I'm most certainly not drinking.
    But I can't stop thinking - ""Fuck she's hot"",
    and someone just offered me another shot.
    So now it's 5 poison, 6 poison,
    red poison, blue poison.
    I know the seventh was pinot noire, 
    but that blue stuff stung, and -
    Hold up is that bro getting in a car?
    What a fuckin' goof, I don't think I need any more proof
    that he's a douch, but I'm pretty aloof
    myself, and i've gotta look after my own health.
    I think I'll just chill on that window-sill.
    So I walked over there and and had a nasty fall.
    I shouldn't have mixed all that alcohol.

Poet 2:

Warcraft

    if all the witches in the world got together,
    there'd be one hell of a shit storm
    spells, screams, and torture galore 
    its thoughts like these
    --holy shit! i just saw a boar--
    that i imagine as i walk through Elwynn 
    leaves rustling on the forest floor
    the path is growing narrow and... i see it, the ridge
    looking down at my keys, i prepare my hands
    and cross that familiar bridge
    night falls fast on Westfall's mine
    dead- 
    the server sleeps, nobody's online

Lugubrious

    look at you
    you're so pathetic
    why are you even here?
    just leave this place, and take that too 
    -that thing you always hold so close
    we dont want it here, it isn't pure
    ...and neither are you
    dont do it, dont you dare
    infect this world with your solemn looks
    your empty stares and depressing books
    we are happy and we are free
    and most importantly
    we are not you

Juicy

    seeking the succulent, the tender and sweet
    juicy fleshes of the young and petite,

    oh how his member twitched in delight
    and then Peter pounced, manhood erect,

**Stab me, goddamnit! I don’t wanna breathe anymore,

every breath is shit without the silver clouds of before.

I miss every particle of death, of dreary disease.

I miss its grip tight unto me, it’s menacing grin with no intention of release.

Oh, what I wouldn’t trade to stare into death’s dead eyes,

I feel mine tearing up as I tell myself countless lies.

“It will get better”, the lying lips of longing speak,

and I have trouble distinguishing between addiction and crushing defeat.

I know with every breath of gray, I might choke,

yet it feels so much safer than denying myself one harmless smoke.**"	t5_2qhhu	True

He threw a feather out to sea and it returned a tack,  
Frustrated he remarked ""At least you're giving something back!""  
I want to stay connected so I bought myself a phone,  
Then I realized that I am connected, its those people that're alone.  
So baby don't you see I've got all these things inside my head  
You say you want to know me, go know yourself instead.  
  
My father tried to tell me before I was too old,  
""Work hard now my son, It'll pay off a hundred fold"".  
I said ""who the hell am I to listen to something like that?  
All I want right now dad, is just a brand new leopard skin pillbox hat""  
I went to the barber shop, where they tried so hard to cut my hair,  
the barber said ""it's much too long to cut, for god's sake I wouldn't dare""  
So baby is it obvious, I've got all these things inside my head,  
I know you've got them too so go know yourself instead.  
  
The fans are always spinning in the superhuman room,  
Trying to cool the heads, studying their doom.  
But every time you learn something, you pay the price of being alone.  
That's still better than paying in blood, especially your own.   
So you see baby these things weigh me down like lead,  
and if you don't leave me now honey, they'll crush you instead.
    
I told this to a man and he said these things aren't really real.

wanting us all to be happy, told me,  ‘be happy Henry!’

But my father continued to beat her     
 and me several times a week while  
raging inside his 6-foot-two frame    
 because he couldn’t understand what was attacking him from within.    

My mother, poor fish, wanting to be happy,
 beaten two or three times a week, telling me to be happy:  
 ‘Henry, smile! why don’t you ever smile?’    

And then she would smile, to show me how,   
and it was the saddest smile I ever saw.  

One day the goldfish died, all five of them,  
they floated on the water, on their sides, their eyes still open,    
and when my father got home he threw them to the cat    
there on the kitchen floor

I love the way you have the most ridiculous bed head in the morning  
The way you check the trees out the window every time you pass them. 


I love the way you put a little too much sugar in your coffee   
The way you blast your music as you drive to work  
How perfectly you park your car  
The way you will hold the elevator for a stranger  
The way you get frustrated at the copy machine  
And how you never go to lunch alone.

I love the way you are always the first person to take the tough assignments  
The way you always have free time to listen to others  
The way you stay late to help your coworkers  
How you drive by the reservoir most days on your way home  
And the way you make sure every door and window is locked as soon as you get home.


I love how you call your mother every week  
How your dinner is always homemade and fresh  
How you will sometimes fall asleep while watching TV  
And I love the sound of your deep breaths as you lie sleeping.  


I love the look on your face when I accidentally startle you awake.

And I hate you.

I hate you because three years ago you said no and got that restraining order.

But you’ll see.  
One day you’ll love me back and I’ll remove the cameras.  
I’ll get rid of the GPS units I’ve hidden.

Closer and pressed tighter like a mother its long lost child,    
A moment’s release, a moment’s desire    
Ignite intrinsic grace,    
And time stopped.  And began again.  Far too soon.

Forever only lasts as long as a frozen second.

The goodbyes were said with no lingering dread,    
The smiles melt any ice, and they live with the choice,    
And so die with the choice to open the door,    
Die with the choice to drive through an average intersection,    
Die with the choice hung on another man’s neck,    
The choice to swill, to refuse, to hold pride,    
The choices collide in the moment time stops,    
That which ended leaves a crystallized fiancé,    
A man whose drunken revelries thrust him through the fray,    
And a man whose most joyful moments were mere minutes away."	t5_2qhhu	True

that you bought and subsequently   
microwaved passes your lips;   
and the buttery flavor  
with its pencil-lead aftertaste   
sends signals through your spine,    
making your brain feel real pleasure

you took last night,   
which I'm sure you didn't share   
with your phone, though   
it is conceivable  
your best friend was standing     
in the hallway, all ears,   
holding a freshly laundered towel,   
beyond the open door exhaling   
steam wroth with lilac, swollen   
with the successive stories that your tongue,  
even coated in egg and refined white flour,    
and salty pork and flecks of spinach,

when the needle bit my skin


I bit my lip


and waited for that myth


The euphoria better than sex

The world stopping, silent

FINALLY






And when I stood up

The waves came crashing in

And my blood icy

And I knew




Why people throw everything away

for a spoonful

Why skeletons can't manage shame

when they disappear



Why my friend stayed up three hours

after I went too far

and went to bed

to make sure I was still breathing



I can do anything and make it through

As long as there's still fight

somewhere in me



It doesn't mater if my veins

want to collapse

And I'm told

who is afraid of me dying

who couldn't decipher my opiate babel



It doesn't matter how long

my eyes roll back in my head for

Or that it doesn't bother me

to own a hummingbird heart




Because I already told the ghosts,

months ago on a different coast,

that there's still some fight in me

If you can keep your head when all about you 

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; 

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, 

But make allowance for their doubting too; 

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, 

Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, 

Or, being hated, don't give way to hating, 

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;



If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
 
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; 

If you can meet with triumph and disaster 

And treat those two imposters just the same; 

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken 

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, 

Or watch the things you gave your life to broken, 

And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;




If you can make one heap of all your winnings 

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, 

And lose, and start again at your beginnings 

And never breath a word about your loss; 

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
 
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
 
And so hold on when there is nothing in you 

Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on"";



If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 

Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch; 

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; 

If all men count with you, but none too much; 

If you can fill the unforgiving minute 

With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -
 
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

Turn off the clocks, cut the telephone,

stop the dog barking with a juicy bone?

No, let him bark; he won’t last long.

Sip the coffee, read the paper,
drive to work, come home;

he’ll be there waiting, but not for long.

Dogs don’t live forever, nor do men;

not even dogs who were somebody's best friend. 

He’s graying now, and moving slow,

but sometimes you see it-- still so happy, still so full

of that same joy he had

when you brought him home.

You were eight years old, he was a ball of fur;

now you’re trying to be a man, still trying to grow,

and back at home he’s almost gone.

Will you be there to see him go?

Will he know you love him, that he’s a good boy?

Please, there’s no need to dismantle the sun;

just play with your puppies while they’re still young.



And when your dog is dead and gone,

find a new one, take him home;

and try to love him even more

than you ever loved the one before;

and always remember, it isn’t only dogs

who come and go, like a short sweet song--

your mother, father, sister too,

they won’t last long.

And all those family dinners will be done.

So while you’re home for Christmas, be forewarned!

What seems so solid now will one day turn to ash.

So please, do not trouble yourself with cash,

or fame or martyrdom;

just remember who loves you,

and love them in return.

i was fourteen years old when a manic-depressive

poised to set this new, wonderful and frightening  
experience to the flame,  
and struck the flint,  

i swear on my name and on the face of GOD,  
i looked into the eyes of the sun,

1361266843.0	18t799	Before making poems that don't follow meter or rhyme schemes, make poems that do.	Lolita_Humbert	27	5	11	"It is extra work to get a good meter going on, or to follow a rhyme scheme without making the poem clunky and stagnant and pretentious, but I promise you it pays off. My poems are really shit right now, I admit it, but they're getting a bit better all the time as I learn how to use the rules. When you know how to use the rules, you can learn how to bend them. If you bend them without knowing them, it's like trying to bend an iron bar without pumping up your muscles first. It just won't work and will look pathetic.

So when you write down a poem, don't immediately submit it here. Follow through the poem, capitalize the stressed syllables. Is there no meter? Well make one! Whether it be the classical iambic pentameter or something a bit less common, just try to do it dammit. I know it can be tiring and the results will be shitty for the first ten times, but after that the poem WILL sound better. After that, you may want to apply a simple rhyme scheme like ABAB, which is my favourite, just to train your ability to follow the rules. Does the poem sound clunky now? Well shit, son, get back to it and fix it.

Also rereading, rereading again, rewriting, and rewriting again, will work to make your poems better. Read the poem. Are there any parts which don't bear any meaning? Take 'em off, throw 'em in the bin. Reread. Anything you forgot to say, or any new ideas, any words that would fit better or sound better? Put 'em there. Just don't let the first draft be the final, cause son I can promise you, you ain't any Bill Shakesman so get back to your shit and do it again. Try rewriting it without checking back on the first draft, and then maybe synthesise the two poems. Again, it's just a draft not a final.

So how much better is that poem now? Probably not much. But do this about ten or so times with different poems, and you've got something going already. I can promise that.

    I drew on your face, understand my compulsion
    to graph you out. I can’t simplify  you, 
    the quiet interval between my heartbeat.
    Warm in your grasp, you are pulling me 
    into a cozy alcove, the easy slope in the crook
    of your arm around my waist, whispering
    to me as you lead me to the backyard.
    I wish I could embrace
                being lost like you. 

    Before you say there is no difference between us, 
    there is and it is not positive.
    I am a negative slope, crossing the axis,
    tilting my earth out of orbit, uncontrolled -
    but you draw me  in like gravity. I am your skeptic
    angel, not soft but hard, not feathered but stone.
    I want to reach you. The arches of my feet lift up, 
    and when our lips intercept - 
     I am still obsessed  
                with the space in between us. 

    Before you start erasing your name
    from my variables, consider my addiction
    to equations. I am  trying  to enclose you in brackets, 
    to pigeonhole you in my broken function.
    But you are mystery, a boundless pair 
    of brown eyes lit up with flecks of golden hieroglyphs. 
    So when you set me down on a patch of grass;
    I am lost until I find on my map, my point of origin
    residing within the curve
                 of your ear to ear smile. 

    Before you start counting down from ten,
    please be patient. I have a penchant for numbering
    our days, even though you are always a constant.																
    Your worth is my absolute value,
    shining bright this evening, in the night sky,
    where stars are hung as fixtures, 
    like  a scattergram. In the mixture of these
    highlighted coordinates,  you draw pictures 
    out of this blackness and
 		 call them constellations. 

    Before we continue our midnight adventure,
    remember that with you, I am prime, undivided. 
    I am whole with no remainder.
    So tonight, I won’t  count the buttons
    that you untangle from my shirt’s holes. 
    I won’t measure the temperature 
    of your cold hands on my skin.
    When you kiss me I concede 
    that not everything needs
                 to be worked out.

Where the bruises used to be, now makeup takes their place.

She muffles sobs of agony, as drunken snores fill the room.
By day he threatens violence, by night he follows through.

For years her minds been searching, for an escape route she could take. 
Every time she packs her things, he beats her till she breaks.

Her mother died some years ago, her father's locked away.
She feels alone inside this world, her life so very grey.

By day when he is off at work, she plays with his pistol in her hand.
She holds it out and screams out loud,
I'll kill you where you stand!

In her heart she knows she can't, he's the man she used to love.
She takes a bow to the cold hard ground, his fists rain down from above. 

Today her soul is broken, no tears are flowing through.
In her hand she holds the key, her freedom coming soon.

Her mouth is fully open, gun powder rushes in. 
The bullets left the building, a drop of blood lands on her chin.

Her husband sits in jail, her body told the story.
Her final work of art, was enough to sway the jury. 

Her paintbrush was a trigger, her easel was the ceiling.

    I spent my first year in America mute, unable to speak the language,
    but I understood it when the other kids in first grade said
    my head looked like an egg, laughed at my ignorance of the word
    vagina,
    and asked how best
    to cook dogs. I wanted to tell them that hot dogs are best cooked
    by shoving them up their ass, but I didn’t have the word for
    ass,
    or a verb as visceral as shove.
    
    I made a vow to always have the words. I learned English and
    I learned how to write. I learned that every situation can be defused
    with surgical phrasing and every insult
    can be turned with a better insult.
    Later in life I learned wordplay as foreplay. I escaped my silent prison.
    
    There are still times when I don’t have the words.
    When stoned - when transfixed by a Jackson Pollock - when asked to comment
    on an expensive wine paired perfectly (I’m told) with a charcuterie course.

and it was in those moments that i finally noticed you. you were tall. and strong. and so handsome that i would leap out of katie’s room when i heard a car door close in hopes of grasping a glimpse of you coming home

was it tiffany. tami. tina.

because sometimes you would stop. and really look at me. and if i was lucky you might bring your beer out to the dock and let me take a sip if no one looked. and sort of humor me by letting me ask you questions.

was beer good. was driving hard. when did you get to go to college. and what did you want to be when you grew up.

you sort of snorted when i said I didn’t know what i wanted to be.

you’re 11.

12 i said with all the womanly courage i could muster. and you said well, i guess you have time then. and you patted my back. and i beamed.

i would steal moments with you whenever i could. running into you in the hallway. drives to the 7/11 to buy cigarettes that i didn’t smoke. i even fell in the water to see if you’d come in. you laughed. deeply.

and jumped in.

and the years passed.

and you showed me the correct way to shoot pool.

and how to row with only one oar.

and that squirt guns really do work better if you aim them.

and the best way to make macaroni.

and what a corona was. and when your friends asked who i was you even sometimes remembered to say

tina.

and i think i loved you. in the way a young girl loves someone whom she doesn’t really know. in the way a little sisters friend falls in love with her older brother. in the way songs talk about your first kiss when you are 13 on a skating rink. in the way that is innocent and sweet and stupid.

and the years passed.

and i no longer speak to katie. although i wish we could. but pride has this awful way of getting in the way.

and how i wish i could ask you questions. about if i’m grown up yet.

and if it’s still okay that i haven’t figured it out.

and i want to tell you i now know the difference between an IPA and a Lager.

but it seems now, I can’t. you’ve jumped again.

at 23 i learn you’re gone.

this wasn’t the post i was supposed to write.

and this wasn’t the way you were supposed to die.

you were wild. and edgy. untamable. and maybe a little angry. but you were brave. and strong and tall.

and it was yourself that got to you in the end.

In order to give this fine work the time it deserves, each month I am going to highlight my picks for the best of the best (from self-posts only). Please leave your picks in the comments! 

I had a hard time choosing my favorite original piece from April, as there were two that forced me to exclaim ""brilliant!"". First, let's take a look at [""Not Today"" by Sixstringsoul](http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/st64g/not_today_criticism_encouragedwelcome/). 

    Cold sea of concrete
    Rubber rivers
    tied with shoelace snakes
    The throaty chatter of steel stallions
    
    Blast, Blast your battle horns
    This briefcase battalion 
    This trench coat warfare
    Holed up in your towers of glass
    
    Unsheathe the weapon
    Stabbing, bleeding inky black
    A letterhead phalanx
    Advance, Advance they say
    
    Not today my friend,
    
    Not today


I love the *subtlety* of the speaker's voice. This is a subjective, first-person poem, but we don't know that until the last two lines. The word ""I"" is never used. 

But the speaker's words are powerful despite coming few in number. At first, the poem looks like an extended metaphor comparing the workaday business world to warfare. The execution is technically impressive, but that alone is not enough to make the bestof list. The last two lines are the magic that give the metaphor purpose and life. He is not making it merely to be clever, he is doing so to communicate his weariness with the work world, his rejection of it. His experience has made him like a Vietnam vet, fed up and disillusioned, fighting PTSD and substance withdrawal. Mourning missing limbs. 

For economy of words, this piece is a win. We get deep insight into the speaker's mind with only six words from him (""Not today my friend, / not today"" ). And the metaphor is incredibly well-worked. ""Throaty chatter of steel stallions"" is a vivid depiction of the noise of engines idling in traffic, and ""Trench coat warfare"" is the kind of brilliant phrase that stops me in mid sentence. Solid, solid stuff. 

The second piece which really stood out last month was [""What Happened When You Left"" by madgearmisslekid](http://www.reddit.com/r/Poetry/comments/syaeu/what_happened_when_you_left_feedback_welcome/). 

    At your betrayal,
    My slavering dog rage
    led me on long walks
    to still places where
    I frightened off lovers
    and howled alone.

    Grief and I became
    as grudging friends then
    to trudge hand-in hand and
    stand eyes downcast by
    waters of slate-grey.

    I begged him always
    to help me forget
    and repeated washings
    buried your bright scent

    but with numb trembling
    chalk hands too weary
    to hold strength or purpose
    I would too often
    find your cruelties in
    keepsakes of love
    and your words left for me.

    Still the accusing walls
    scream more memories
    and our tiny refuge
    will never quite
    be my own home
    but it will never be
    truly empty.

    Your abscence
    is still here.
    
I wouldn't have chosen this poem if I had any choice in the matter because I've read 100 other poems on the subject of lost love in April and they were all *bad*. But this one avoids the cliche into which lost-love poems usually stumble - in fact, it is too good to ignore. 

First, note the stength of the imagery. ""Slavering dog rage"" is a shockingly original description of the state of mind of the forsaken lover. And it does double purpose, describing the poet's internal state and also illustrating their relationship to the world (""I frightened off lovers and howled alone""). 

Similarly, ""chalk hands"" are an original description of the weakness the poet feels. We think of weak hands as too weak to grasp physical objects, but these hands are too weary to ""grasp strength or purpose"". Subverting our expectations, they are too weak to *refrain* from grasping some physical things - old keepsakes. 

The most striking feature of this poem is its *progression*. It tightens over time into more and more claustrophobic expressions of grief, simultaneously in subject and in physical structure. At first, the poet is wandering in society (""frightening off lovers""), then they are taking walks alone with their grief. Soon they aren't even leaving the house, going through keepsakes and pacing around the same rooms used to hold their relationship. As the poet's world shrinks, the line length shrinks as well. It has the effect of someone turning inward, being compressed by their grief. 

On a side note, I have no idea of the genders of either lover in this poem, but it doesn't matter. It works every way. That's cool. 

The poet says this took them four years to write, and I believe it. It's a damned fine piece of work. Plath-esque.

    I fell in love
    With a very sad boy,
    Who cried at night
    While his parents told him
    to, ""Man up.""

    Once,
    I went to school
    And I watched him eat alone
    So I sat near him
    And told him about a rose bush
    I had found,
    And then promised to show him.

    Once,
    I heard a thank you
    I saw a smile
    That lit up the world
    And I lit up with it

    Once,
    I fell in love
    And he did too.

    But it only took 
    Once
    For his demons
    To win.

    So once,
    I woke up
    To a too late plea
    For someone to please
    Please
    ""Help me.""

    Once,
    I wrote sad words
    For a room full 
    Of death.

    Once,
    The school's rose bush
    Was found cut and dead

    Once,
    I found his name
    Marked on a lifeless stone
    And screamed to the carver
    His stone was no good.
    For this boy's heart
    Could never be that cold.

    Once,
    I fell in love

                        Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night

                       Do not go gentle into that good night,
                  Old age should burn and rage at close of day;
                      Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

                 Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
                 Because their words had forked no lightning they
                      Do not go gentle into that good night.

                 Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright 
               Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
                     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

               Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
                And learn, too late, they grieved it in its way,
                      Do not go gentle into that good night.

               Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
                 Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
                   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
                
                And you, my father, there on the sad height,
              Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
                     Do not go gentle into that good night.
                    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

    Lend Me an Ear

    I went and sat by the shores today
    Out to see the waves
    Attempt to ease up tensions built
    My soul in disarray

    Heaven won't bestow on me
    The answers that I seek
    Stars neglect in unison
    Sky completely bleak

    This does not surprise me
    They weren't asked to fill this task
    I just came to see the tumbling water
    Clash on its own back

    In search of my serenity
    Beside an empting flask
    Basking in solitude merrily
    The waves won't let it last

    Repeating of its sorrows
    With each recurring splash
    It spoke before I got here
    Or anyone else at that

    Describes in utter detail
    Of all the nights so cold
    Extracted tales from memory
    To no one ever told

    The waves have heard, and said much more
    But never an ear in sight
    ""Fear not!"" A roar unleashed by me
    Your streak ends here tonight

    I came to dwell on my own mishaps
    Perhaps a pain or two
    Yet, my attention caught in stride
    By your endless brood

    I too never understood
    Why times can be so harsh
    Yet I know a weight has lifted
    Off your burdened heart

    You don't need an answer
    Just someone to hear
    I bet it's worth the trouble
    Contesting through the years

    For the moment you've recessed
    Until I disappear

a pair of shoes on feet too large.





I sing when I do not know the lyrics,


speak when I do not remember the words.





I hurt like a bruised apple.


My smile is actually a grimace.





Stored in the locket round my neck


is all my pain and sorrow,





heavy enough that if I were to ever go swimming,


I would drop to the bottom like an anchor.





My pain and sorrow anchor me here.


Without it I would fly away like a birthday balloon.





When I lie on the ground and tilt my head back,


I fall into the sky like a seltzer in a glass of water.





I do not know my name,


not like the muscle that twitches in my eye-lid,





not like the crooked nail on my left toe.


My name is just a bunch of letters,





but the mole between my pointer and index finger


reminds me that I am just a human.



I do not believe in God,


though not nothing is holier than blossoms in the spring.





I am nineteen years old and still wish I could fly.


I promise to jump out of the first plane I ever ride in.





If I could have a super-power,


it would be to go back in time to October 11th, 2008





to tear up those letters


and tell my parents how much I love them.





Every new tattoo is a desperate attempt to camouflage myself


from everything I have ever done.

I wish I were an eagle.





I wish I were a penguin in a sea lion's maw.

SetDarknessEchoing	24	3	16	"Just like last month we are having another competition and this time it is for the spoken word, please read ALL the following rules before entering as this competition will naturally need to be controlled carefully.

* All poems will obviously have to be submitted in video format, I would strongly recommend Youtube but anything similar will be fine, no poems should be required to be 'Downloaded'.

* You should mention at the start that you are submitting to the competition, this is to avoid plagiarism

* Entries should be no longer than 5 minutes in length

* Entries should be your own work please, no reading of someone else's work!

* When filming it would help to have a shot of the face (expressions etc), which of course will only help your cause!

* Entries should have the link messaged to me through Reddit. I will then pass them on to the other two judges (Moammargandalfi and Avidd), that way we can keep submissions nice and smooth!

* Closing date for submissions will be 28th-29th January

As a side-note I am also working on the idea of weekly competitions with Mavriksfan11 and between us we'll get that rolled out ASAP.

Any questions feel free to ask below or message me. Best of luck to everyone!"	t5_2qhhu	True

I've seen none, but I have seen tons of people post hard work and get no to little feedback, including when they are directly asking for it.

I notice that there is another reddit called [poeticreddit](www.reddit.com/r/poeticreddit) that is also for posting submissions and having them reviewed or for posting links to existing work.  Could we try to merge and delineate?

So, are people reading and just not voting or commenting?
Are others here like me, just looking for great poetry and not to review someone's fresh new work?

I'm sorry that it seems like I don't appreciate it, I'm just trying to clear things up.  Is there another reddit for submitting links to established poetry I could check out?

---


BIG EDIT/Answers: Some things have been resolved.  There is a reddit (r/verse) completely dedicated to posting favorite poems, etc, and NOT original work (again, nothing against original work).

Some thoughts: 

1.  I'm not sure how many people who read r/poetry are really looking for r/verse, but since ""verse"" is not very descriptive, you might want to make it clear in your sidebar.  (you could do like r/verse has done and say that for posting existing work go to r/verse).

2.  r/poeticreddit and r/poetry should probably be combined with one deleted, unless there really is still some mod abuse/neglect going on in one of them (not saying that there is).

3.  Everyone who submits a poem here, for the sake of your fellow poets, review a couple!  Poetry is important, powerful art.  Even with things like Occupy Wall St. you could use poetry for positive change.

4.  A review can be just be a positive comment, it doesn't have to be an educated poetic critique.

Well, I have quickly made and destroyed my own soapbox.  I'll be leaving r/poetry for r/verse, and I won't come back until I decide to write my own, or until one of you gets something on the front page, you can do it!"	t5_2qhhu	True

    4 days after my birthday
    My parents made a split-decision
    Based on superstition
    That I should get a circumcision
    The doctor sliced with precision
    And made an incision
    That caused a division
    Between what God had blessed
    And what was no longer required after a holy revision

    Maybe I'm a bit of a sceptic
    But isn't it a little barbaric
    That a deity who has power over everything genetic
    Creates something naturally unclean
    Which requires local anasthetic
    To be removed for reasons deemed cleric
    By old text that is poetic, prophetic
    Isn't that fucking pathetic?
    Putting an infant through surgery deemed cosmetic
    While proclaiming your stance as apologetic
    And not feeling sympathetic

    However. A greater source of vexation
    is that when I vent my frustration
    about the semi-castration
    of my modest perturbation
    To a friend or relation
    Instead of reacting to the tale of my operation
    With a degree of condemnation
    What occurs is the following situation
    Like tuning a tv to get the static out of a dodgy station
    Without the need of actual observation
    They can now with their imagination

    There was a childhood of sticky fingers and chocolates stolen

    in the dark of night

    and eaten in delicious forbidden fear

    of being found,

    and every day my grandmother 

    filled the house with the smell of hearty food

    because it was the only way she knew how to say 

    “I love you, even though you’re messy and your hair is unbrushed”. 

    In the school lunchroom,

    I was jealous of the kids with brown paper bags,

    because I had clear tupperware with sandwiches

    that had meat so spicy that you could smell it

    all the way over on the other side of the room.

    There was birthday cake that I only had to share with two other people,

    even though I had invited twelve.

    I swallowed gobs of sweet blue frosting that tasted so bitter.

    There were the lollipops that stayed in a bowl

    on the school psychologist’s little round table, 

    and as I answered questions like a vending machine,

    giving out the answers I knew they wanted,

    I stared at the lollipops and wondered if I could ask for one.

    I never did, because I didn’t want them to think

    that I needed anything from them.    



    I remember two different summer camps,

    floating in the space between elementary school and high school.

    For two weeks, one hot summer in Michigan,

    I rode horses and swam in small ponds full of snapping turtles,

    and I couldn’t speak the language of all the girls in my cabin, 

    because I had never learned how to speak

    without a smarty-pants accent.

    I hated all the food there, 

    so for two weeks, breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

    all I had was peanut butter on wonder bread.

    My mouth was too sticky to let me say

    “Please, don’t hate me,

    I just want to be friends,

    I’m sorry that I’m not like you”.

    After two weeks of peanut butter and silence,

    my thighs had turned into wonder bread,

    soft and squishy,

    and I went home and never ate peanut butter again.




    Two years later,

    I went to fat camp in Pennsylvania,

    and some sadistic bastard had put a camp

    full of girls with extra chins and heavy breath,

    right next to a chocolate factory.

    .........................................................REALLY??!!

    When the skinny, pretty councilors 

    woke me up at 5:30 in the morning

    so that I could run for two miles, 

    the smell of chocolate hung in the air

    as heavily as the mist, 

    and with every sweaty pant

    I expelled while running around an endless track

    and gasping to keep up with yet another group of girls who rejected me,

    I could taste nothing but sweet desire, 

    and I would run harder, hoping 

    that if I could lose as much of myself as possible,

    I would stop wanting,

    wanting to eat,

    wanting to be wanted, wanting to be beautiful.

    But no matter how much I ran,

    I never managed to lose even a bit of myself,

    in pounds or in thoughts.




    Now I have a rest-of-my-life-hood

    of thinking of carbs and calories and sodium and trans fats,

    and  the jiggly bits of my thighs and arms and stomach,

    of eating vegetables and ignoring bread,

    of avoiding eating in public because there’s a different kind of fear now,

    of hating food, of hating eating, of hating the fact 

    that I cannot photosynthesize, 

    that no matter how far I stretch upwards toward the sun,

    no matter if I can taste the wind across my skin,

    I will never become a tree,

    I will never be able to live off of air and sunlight,

    I will never not be trapped in this useless body.

    I have learned what it means to be hungry.

    for these words,    
    both

    and

    Forgive me, for     
    in the morning I shall    
    not be the man    
    I was. I shall

He threw shoes, he punched walls,

he lept into my heart.

    I pictured him there: hanging out, 
    rope moaning like his mother,
    the windy city making -
    forcing - him to be blown
    back and forth, ultimately alone. 

    I saw him bathing 
    in a tub of deepest red 
    wine, the drunkenness creating in him
    sad and lonely desperation.
    The wine dripped down, offering lonely libation. 

    They gathered all us students into a small chapel,
    100 jerks, jerking off - 
    masturbating to the saints of our own self pity,
    stroking our own egos as we said:
    ""Light will drive out darkness, oh
    he who drives it out is blessed!""
    (But, really, none of us were depressed.)

    Pitifully, we pondered life's meaning
    from inside stone walls. I heard his
    maddening, insane screaming
    rattling inside my head - 
    dead! He was dead. 

    Mike said he had jumped
    in front of the L, his brain
    splashing out onto a sea of unsuspecting passerby's,
    their lives touched by his
    most intimate place, a sanctuary of inner secrets
    shattered. 

    I pictured him sitting in a cafeteria chair
    with hair as big as God's
    is in all those old pictures. 
    ""Mitch"", he'd say to me, already half asleep,
    the school day being half over. 
    ""It's not about how fast you move, 
    or how much money you have to lose.""
    He'd pause to take a bite of whatever
    monstrous feast he'd bought in line, taking forever. 
    ""No, it's really about  having a good time,
     about making sure your friends are as good as mine.""

    I pictured him lying to us, 
    lying down face first in the dust. 
    Where most of us were small,
    (waist size, hair, personality, intellect)
    he was huge, grand and tall. 
    
    250lbs, 5'10"",
    a giant life, never lived, never to be made again.

Now, I know this isn't a workshop exactly, and in fact that need is now fulfilled by r/litworkshop, but I think a lot of people here are afraid to share their thoughts about a poem because they don't know how the author will react. 

I wonder if this could be mitigated by either a guideline in the side-bar that specifies tagging a post, maybe as [heavy crit] [light crit] [no crit]?  Maybe creating flair for users that indicates what sort of critique they are comfortable with?

Like songs for Hiroshima

Full of terror, full of dreams

And when the dying dusk settles

We can run through the park

With our flashlights

Spraying shadows, sending demons

Into the sleepless hours

Hanging like a fever, like the touch

Of Summer's musk

Over our abstract medium

Our concrete jungle

Like faraway lands with craters

Scorched earth and barren fields

Places with your father's bones

Where death followed them underground

Where secret wars were raged by secret men

Paranoid men

We smashed our bottles and performed

Our dance

    while the old men play checkers in the park

    the beautiful are found at the edge of a room
    crumpled into spiders and needles and silence
    and we can never understand why they
    left, they were so
    beautiful.

    they don’t make it, 
    the beautiful die young
    and leave the ugly to their ugly lives.
    lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death
    as the old men play checkers in the sun

Whether this day brings heat or fright

My love couldn’t stop his flight, 

I am naught.


Now, I plead to be something, or nothing:

“Give me a heart that my mind can control

Or take it all: my will, life, and soul.”

Let's have an actual conversation about your poetry. 30 lines maximum (for now) posted to the comments. Write a brief note to me if you would like me to notice or consider something specific while I read your work. Every comment posted before midnight WILL get a reply, I promise that even if it is tomorrow.

Other subs have threads with hundreds of comments. I want to read a hundred poems today.

EDIT: It is Central Daylight Time here so it is currently 6 hours to midnight.

EDIT: So you know that dinner we talked about? It's going to be happening now. I will return about 9PM CDT (or an hour and a half for those without clocks). I want to encourage everyone who submitted a poem to read at least one other in this thread and give a little feedback or ask a question. Y'all have been wonderful so far.

ONE FINAL EDIT FOR TONIGHT: When I started this I was a little worried that I was going to be reading dull poetry all night. You guys proved me very wrong. There are a lot of talented poets around here. So here's the deal. I'm going to be doing this once a week every week for the foreseeable future. My advice may not be perfect but it seemed well received. I would like to keep offering it as long as people want so let me tell you a bit about myself.

I'm United Statesian (WE HAVE A LAME COUNTRY NAME) currently living in Louisiana. It's my family's home state but I grew up elsewhere. I moved here a few years ago to forge a stronger connection with relatives who live here. Since the move, I faced all the challenges someone living one their own for the first time does. I've had a lot of help from a lot of good friends and made good friends with people I would never have thought to talk to before. It's left me open, trying to find something good in everything and trying to make everything not so good a little better. The culture here, the way I was raised, the way of connecting with consideration and respect has changed me into someone more gentle that I ever believe I could be. Healer, repairman, or just generally compassionate person, I want to help others and the people on this sub are some of the others I'd like to help. We are a community and I intend to take that seriously. I'm off for drinks with some friends now. Good night and good writing!

Anything y'all post before tomorrow afternoon at 3 I will give some feedback on as well."	t5_2qhhu	True

Get off the wall, she told the Sunlight,

Get off the wall, she told the Boy,

Trips off the lips 

And slips out with ease

No pause or freeze;

Floating by, innocent lies

On a carefree breeze //


Questions arise

Lies grow cream, with that egg shell sheen

Sickly tinges of green

Ornamented

Embellished

No relishing explaining this scene //



Spiralling down through shades of brown

Not so clever now

Take a bow

This vow sees untruth don a darker gown //



Raise the bar

In too far, spewing tar of darkest black

The weight will break your back

Because there’s nothing. I’ve yet to decide.

With a spark.  I could be crouching  
In the cab of a one-seat delivery truck.  
I could be leaning on the dash, the cold  
Coming off my shoulders, cascading.  
Once it was 4:00 a.m., a parking lot,  
December, 1985, February, a street corner,  
Connecticut.  I could feel it strong  
As my boss did what he knew how  
With a broken coin box.  He spun the ratchet   
Like a pinwheel, his eyes on the horizon.  
With bolt cutters, he broke the night open,  
Left me electric with a low sparkle,  
The sense of someone watching me.  


For weeks I studied an ancient woman  
Forgotten in the back of a shop.  
She sat on a chair too small,  
Drawing secrets from Japanese slippers  
With a long curved needle of bone.  
As the needle came around, so did I,  
Pulled into her craft.  Her pierce crackled  
The clear glaze of the morning.  The alignment,   
Her polarity, sent ions coursing my way.  
They called and I wanted to go,  
to swim upstream, to taste the source.


Last night, waiting without a proper jack,  
I wondered what else was missing.  
I didn’t even know its name.  
The mechanic came in a thin gray coat.    
He used a foot-long flathead to pry  
Off the hubcap, a brace under the wheel,  
A tire iron to loose the lugs.  
The pneumatic wrench he fired up  
Was exciting to consider, but it was  
The torque wrench that released the energy.  
He checked each lug three times, once  
For his mother, once for his gods,  
Once for the wrong names they’d been given.  
I felt forces gathering.  They sang louder  
With each foot-pound applied.  
I felt the guardians of his craft  
Tug on my earlobe, saw their heads  
Nod to the skill of those sure hands,  
Felt on my skin their low crackle pull.  
There are so many things I don’t know.  
Wild guesses will have to be my bedrock.  
To start, I will be standing in rainstorms,  
Wrapped in copper coil, my hands held high.

Through 8th grade, through boyfriends,

Through football games and weekends,

Until a bump blossomed on her 13-year-old frame

And the rumor of our secret affair had to change.

Are you the father? They’d ask, 

In smiles dripping with sarcasm

Droplets I’d catch

With a laugh,

I wish.

I wish, that the person

Who fathered that child

Could be the one who holds you tight when you’re crying.

I wish, that the lips

That shush your fears away

Were the same lips that get to kiss yours every day.

He should carry your books

While you carry his child

Instead I’m holding your hair

As the pancake bile

Of that morning’s breakfast

Makes an entrance, unexpected

In 4th period history.

I know you’d do the same for me.

So we’ll keep fighting

And we’ll keep winning

‘Til we can give this baby a fresh beginning;

Born out of the hallway battlefields

Of middle school

Into a cradle of love

Shrink behind their wooden desk

In fear of looking at the breast,

From within,

It is a mortal thing that corrupts

All this life begins with lust,

A lust of life and fruit so red,

That it comes with what is said

From the man behind the stand,

But I know his mask is thin

And I see the sins he holds,

Hiding in his own skin folds

Oh his sins and how they seep,

But he brings the folks to weep,

But he won’t know what’s in store,

Without the mask interrupting me.

Was there ever a me without the mask?

I suppose there was, I wonder what he was like.

As I near the end of my life, I long to remember my old face,

So I remove the mask and there is nothing but bone left in its place.

If there was never a mask, was there ever a me?

Have I ever met anyone? Or is it just masks that I see?

Looming, the abyss of rolling thunder.
Clouds part freeing rays from God,
A warmth surpasses the cool of our skin.
Yet we have lain on sodden banks,
Dank the grass, the mud imprinted with sin.


Threadbare as we watch. Our minds puddled.
The tailor weaves his magic,
Like the sly Wizard he seems,
A swatch of stolen fabrics.
""We reap what we sow"", we have been told.
Stolen by no man but ones full of anguish, How is he to know?
When only we had dipped our toes in.


Frozen, inside.
Frozen.
The window, the pieces of our broken mirror.
Your porcelain face seemingly perfect amongst the cracks.
Mine, the reflection of scrutiny, but a minor.
My reflection? Like an entombed doll from Russia.
Tiny. Nearly forgotten, yet amongst the belly of this beast,
Lies the figure who'll fight to push her.


Freed from within, the footsteps are silent, still dank.
Like unspoken caws from the Crow,
Dark, mysterious, scheming.
Loosely perched, a false reality.
Imprints nearing full, but not stagnant.
Knowledgable, caring, pleasing.
A black feather nestles gently on the bank.
Dank the grass, the mud imprinted with faith. 


Salutations for the Wizard and his mysterious bird.
Cut into halves, the garment be strewn with passion.
Like a quilt once yanked from the beds forbidden side,
Seemingly fit for only but one,
Instead like a silk pair of gloves,
A truer reality to come,

Probasaur	26	6	9	"Every olive branch outwardly reaching.... comes a begrudging, non-relinquished vine snapped back, disdained, each snap more deserving than the next. 




For every thorn embedded belongs a home to each vile moment, vindicated by holes punctured. 




Forever they may remain a reminder. 




Yet as the stinging clings to memory.... too soon each hole, now together, replaced by one... leave a single scar. 




Tho a mark still to force remembrance, still somehow forgotten. 




As time heals all wounds, the stinging surpasses... drives deeper down this day, to the next.

how old and tired

should I consider  
the dust that hangs  
from each strand  
of my young-girl hair?  



beautiful to age sadly  
with a line for each lesson  
ten sips to each sadness  


she says,  
          I can tell  
          your problem  
          does worry you  


but she in essence  
is a professional,  
professionally unaware  
of the young girl’s  
needs and young-girl past  
unaware now that her body  
is unwanted  


and it doesn’t matter where  
you write or burn or take   
a knife to it,   



the body  
is ever present, it is  
solid in contempt  
and unrenewed ever  


in my guts  
I am not  
young  


and if she were right,  
what then?   


a girl is a woman  
is an alcoholic,  
what then?  


a girl is a lover  
of oblivion, then  


a girl is the   
sex-slave of sadness, then


and to that  
I will say,  
what then?                    



 be a darling.

It was then, in the steamy-white mists of my   
Day-dream that I caught it in the corner of my eye:  
Your message on the glass, brought out like invisible ink.   


You'd drawn our heads in a bow,  
Two circles touching, each with an arrow and a label;   
One is you and one is me.

With your finger and  
I trace it with my own,  
Fascinated as I fall from my hair  
To your chin  
Over

more to be enough,  
But if you had more years  
because,  
what you've had  
surely ain't enough.  

   
Why don't I give you my eye.  
Seeing with one is enough.  
looking like a pirate could be fun.  
I don't need an eye for my I,  
If you had three,  
maybe they'd have seen,  
that black spot that sits  
perched between your wings.  
It was benign this whole time,  
they, said so.  

  
They have four letters,  
that's one more than you  
and four fold next to I.  
Them, their, fuck  
has four letters,  
maybe that's one too much  

  
Why don't you give me that O,  
I'll take it off your back

My load has been light  
and my wings are spread wide  
there's space between them.  
I'll take it if you're willing.

that day when I and he,  
we were playing and eating  
Lego blocks, star wars and Pokemon cards  
I choked. I ran to you,

you saved my life,  
and I left you a lump.  
It was Oh shaped.  
You took it and didn't complain.  
  

But me, he and you-  
we were happy,  
...we only has two letters,  
Yet You have three,  
Why, do you have cancer?

pressed against your head with your own finger on the trigger.  Thinking to   

myself that maybe putting this hole in my head will help stop the vacuum from  

crushing my sanity like a depressurized capsule lost in the infinity of space and  

time.  There’s a reason at age 5 that I could hold a conversation with a stuffed  

lion, but I was lost in the face of a friendly human offering an Otter Pop and a   

Capri-Sun. My mind drew an innocent face carrying cordial words to offer to   

increasingly concerned inquisition.  That bastard went back to work gripping and  

ripping the cords of me until it created a powerless emotional vegetable that   

struggled with even the simplest of human tasks.  I could tell you the feeling of  

apathetically walking through the days that are meant to define a person, but  

I don’t want to be checked into an asylum.  I’m great at offering the correct   

answers, but terrible at believing them.  White noise and feral screams define   

my thoughts and confusion marks my existence.  Throw a few connected words   

in a row and I’ll find a way to rot their core and grow a dead bush in their stead.  

Self-pity is just a sad excuse for narcissism and this can never lead to self-  

actualization or awareness because the closer I step to achieving progress in  

grasping what it means to exist, live, and think, the farther I come from relative  

sanity and the comfort therein.  I wish I could just rip off my face and let myself  

out of this world and enter another existence.  I was born one way and I’ll die another,  

but in the meantime I’m left to discover what is happening in the meantime.  Why do  

I perceive frequencies of sound as the answer to my questions when really the  

frequencies of a person’s voice is really just a product the liar’s existence that  

occurred and is occurring in the milliseconds before I heard and comprehended  

the sounds that were belched in my direction by another lost entity.  Anxiety  

can’t encapsulate my emotions because it’s a word and emotions are more than  

words.  The meaning of a word always encapsulates more truth than its descriptive  

power.  That’s what breeds the dissatisfaction of verbal and written explanations  

of spiritual explorations.  I’ll travel infinitely into myself and return with the entire  

Truth at my soul’s fingertips unable to spit it out because words and words can’t  

express anything beyond words.  The profoundness of a proverb sits beneath the  

proverb and the power of a word could crush the combined expression of written  

work.  There is no depth to anything outside the oceans and lakes because that  

word is so tethered to our cognition.  We are so shitty at understanding anything  

that we have created words and languages to explain everything.  That’s why  

Descartes was wrong, that’s why Plato was wrong, that’s why Nietzsche was  

wrong, that’s why Jesus wasn’t here, and that’s why he’s never coming back.  

Thinking yourself into another reality is frowned upon, so I’ll stop, but what am  

I supposed to do here besides pretend that I love the chocolate I eat and the  

air I can’t taste?

To put them all now in relation,  
This little thing of my creation.    


So I've succumbed to fascination,  
My pen proceeds to battle station,  
My mind should act with inspiration,

On page it now has preservation,  
Inside it gains appreciation,  
When fears receive exoneration,  
When thoughts in words provide elation.  


This may put you into sedation,  
You may not feel the same sensation,  
But this is my infatuation,

They have no real implication,  
And thus they hold no expectation,  
But they lead one into contemplation,  
A poem of sorts, an exploration.

Can lead to quiet desperation,  
But fear ye not the limitation,  
Of this, my wordy incantation.  


I write to relay information,  
Without any consideration,  
To a critic's choice of condemnation,  
Of a poem that's built on no foundation.

""This work needs expert reparation"".  
But give it not your restoration.  
For rhyme is poets’ respiration.  


It merely is an explanation,  
To ease poetic trepidation,  
But lead you not into temptation,  
To find some phoney imitation.  


Enjoy this drawn out innovation,  
A simple, curious observation,  
And treat it not with indignation,  
For lacking perfect punctuation.  


This leaves me near the culmination,  
A stream of thought, imagination,  
Like stars within a constellation,  
United whilst in segregation.

Just an hour ago was laid to rest.
In my 20 years I have loved and lost,
And by my side my mate paid the ultimate cost,
In my short time I have experienced more than most,
Fought a war in a foreign land, on a foreign coast,
How could you claim my life has barely started,
When so many of my mates have, of this earth, departed?”
And with that he stood and said “goodbye”
As the other patrons began to cry,
And the barman wiped many a tear from his eye."	t5_2qhhu	True
1344816589.0	y47tw	The sound of her wings	FuckGoreWHore	19	4	7	"    Death was here to take me,
    but I sorted that cocksucker out
    with an aluminum tube.
    She's dead now,
    on the floor.
    and no one will ever know
    that I killed her.

    I'm sure something or someone else
    will take her place,
    something more vicious
    someone more sly.

    But until then
    I sharpen my nails
    and polish my bullet
    and wait.

    I'm not quiet done with her yet,
    nor her with me.
    and even over loud traffic
    or a sad song
    I can still hear
    the sound of her wings."	t5_2qhhu	True

Nails dig into the skin.   
Inside the mind a somber voice rasps  
Not to move an inch. 


Hands are shaking  
Palms are wet  
Skin grows damp  
With beads of sweat. 

Everyone is afraid of something  
No one had nothing to fear.  
Standing, waiting, and listening,  
Terrified of what you might hear.   

A child fears the things that come out  
When the sun has gone to bed.   
She lays awake for hours,  
Monsters running through her head.   

A parent fears for their little girl,  
Knowing that one day    
The monsters all will leave her head    
And worse things will move in to stay.

1344056930.0	xnqun	Amateur poem, I'd like some feedback as I am just starting out. 	unfortunately_bored	22	5	20	"*I was in Southern France for a few nights this summer and I met the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen. Here’s the poem I wrote, and like many poems about women the subject will probably never read it.* 

    In an uninterrupted sea which bleed into the sky she stood

    the only thing blocking my view

    and I couldn’t care. 



    Eyes as deep as the undisturbed night sky 

    as I looked into them I remembered the first time I saw the sky devoid of the constant haze of the city.

    And once again I fell in

    pulled under the riptide of beauty. 


    With her broken english and my pocket 
    translator we spent the night feebly trying to grasp onto a fleeting moment.

second shelf, first row of book cases to the left of the door, all the way at the end,

that book: *Like the Fallen Leaves* 

remember it?

the one we had to read Sophomore year?

you remember,

it was the one with the red cover with the gold inlay.

I was so happy when you said you would be my partner,

though I made sure not to show it,

 I remember us in the library during lunch

you were wearing that sundress and you still had that short hair,

the book was old so it drew my attention,

we read a bit of it and you said it was okay,

do you remember how we would sit so close?

In class, when we were analyzing the poems inside?

We were so close,

though I pretended to be distant,

do you remember how we would take so long at the library?

How I would stall with tangents?

Just so we could spend more time,

together,

I remember how you weren't going to be in class the next day,

you said you had a doctors appointment, 

do you remember that?

I remember how because I had one the next day I left you a note,

saying how we should get some ice cream after school the next day,

to celebrate the end of the analyzing, 

remember how I slipped it in the book?

Page 86,

I remember how exited I was that you wrote yes,

in those little loops that are your 'O's,

do you remember driving home that day?

Do you remember the intersection?

Do you remember the red light?

Do you remember you not seeing it?

Do you remember the semi-truck?

Do you remember impact?

I remember when I heard the next day,

I remember not hearing the words at all,

having Jane tell me again,

tell me that you were dead,

I remember that I broke down,

I remember the looks from those around me,

I remember when it came out,

that I liked you,

I remember not being in school for a while,

afterwords,

I remember that when I got back the book was back on the shelf,

I remember taking it with trembling hands,

and teary eyes,

I remember flipping through the old pages,

I still remember the smell, 

I always will,

I remember finding the note,

still inside,

I remember that I would come back to it,

to the book,

 every now and again,

just to see the note,

I remember it not being there one day,

I remember asking the librarian,

I remember her saying that she had thrown it away,

I remembered that I never removed the note,

it seemed wrong to do so,

so here I am now,

senior year is ending soon,

and I have one more final before I'm done,

I bought a new copy of that book,

I donated it to the library,

I came back the next day,

and it was where the old one was,

I'm placing this letter inside, 

on page 86,

this shelf will always be a memorial,

at least to me, 

I promise that, 

that I will come back,

and I will stand:

here,

and I will read this note,

and talk to you again,

but now I have to go take my last final,

my poetry final.

I love you.
