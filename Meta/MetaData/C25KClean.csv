1363247050.0	1a9ut7	Couch to 5k may have literally saved my life tonight. 	queenjacko	478	48	79	"I hope that by sharing my story I may convince a few fence post sitters that this is a worth while cause. I'm a 21 year old female who works retail, some nights until 930. I've been really enjoying the couch to 5k program and I've just finished week 6 day 1. Prior to using this program I struggled to jog for even a minute or two. Now for the story: tonight, like many night, I decided to make the 30 minute trip home from work on foot. I live in what most consider a safe area of town and I  had never had any issues in the past. I get about halfway home and pass a man walking in the other direction. I notice he said something to me and I take out my headphone and ask him to repeat what he said. He says ""do you work at [name of grocery store I've just passed an he's walking towards, two grocery bags in hand]?"" I replied that I didn't and took a few steps backwards. The man looks unsure of what to say next and says, I kid you not, ""do you want to be my friend?"" At this point I'm thinking things are weird. I reply ""no, uh, I don't think that will work out"" and begin quickly walking away while dialing my boyfriends number as there are no people are cars around. Now this guy sounds mad. He's shouting really inappropriate things at me and now when I turn around he's changed directions and is walking towards me. I tell my boyfriend to stay on the line, stuff my phone in my pocket, and start running for home. This guy couldn't keep up! By the time I was 3 or 4 minutes into my run I could no longer see him behind me. I told my boyfriend I was okay and dialed 911. I want to sincerely thank this subreddit for the constant onslaught of inspirational posts I see every day, because had this happened before I found you guys, the outcome of the event today may not have been so positive.

1368540410.0	1ebbpi	Thanks to C25K, and the inspiration you all give me, I gave a bully at the gym a response she wasn't expecting.	megn86	469	47	90	"I'm really proud of the way I handled a bully at the gym last night.  She came up to me while I was on the treadmill, doing my C25K for the day, and asked how much longer I'd be. I pointed to the time and said ""That long."" She asked why I would try running. I told her I want to do a 5K in late July/early August, so I work on my run nearly daily. She then pointed at my speed and asked why I would even bother when I'm so slow, I'll probably come in last. After taking a second to catch my breath, and trying to tell myself to be the bigger person and not just tell her ""fuck you,"" I told her it didn't matter if I finished last, just as long as I finished. She walked away with her head low and a guy two machines down gave me a thumbs up

When I first started a few weeks ago, a comment like that would have made me want to give up, and honestly I probably would have just gone home and cried. But not last night. Thanks to you for the inspiration you all have given me, and the way I feel about myself after having done this program for a few weeks now, I'm feeling great about running, and I wasn't going to let her bring me down.

TL;DR - Lady at gym asked why I would even bother with a 5K, since I'm so slow I'll probably be last. Told her it doesn't matter if I finish last, just as long as I finish.

**Update:**  Wow. Thank you everyone for your comments and support!  I went to work out, and came back to this.  So awesome.  And to the person that sent me Reddit Gold - holy crap, thank you!

Unfortunately, the gym is not one that I pay for, it's one that's available at my apartment complex for tenants and their guests. When I got done working out this morning, I did go and speak to one of the property managers about the situation. Unfortunately, she said they don't have anything regarding situations like this, and since I don't know who this woman was, she wouldn't be able to do anything anyways. I've never seen this woman at my apartment complex before, but I guess if I see her again, I'll try to introduce myself."	t5_2rgoq	True

To be fair, I cheated a little on my route. Instead of jogging downhill around my block and then back uphill I just jogged downhill and then sort of parallel for the last half, but the point is I still jogged for 20 minutes without quitting! I'll tackle those uphills next week...



Also, I can say that my plan of having a short, specific number of songs on my playlist worked perfectly! I calculated out that my 20 minute run would take 5 songs, so I was able to focus on them instead of *oh god fifteen more minutes left*.

Because..."	c_hannah	301	79	87	"...that means that you didn't do the damn program! This subreddit is built for and around a specific program. Go gloat to /r/running or /r/Fitness, because when I'm slogging through week 6 trying my best to stick to a program and a schedule and my legs ache and I'm winded and I have to convince myself to keep going, I don't give a shit that you just decided to pass over those runs (through which I just pushed myself) because you could.

And lastly, its ""I ran"" or ""I have run"". They verbs forms are NOT interchangeable. 

edit: I know I fucked up the grammar in the post. I was typing very fast and aggressively during a rant. I know I've lost credibility. 

edit #2: Oneupdouchebag said that this comment of mine better explained my thoughts on the matter...

&gt;I think that people who have gotten off of their butts and have run 5k totally deserve credit and congratulations. If people start later in the program because they were beginning from a more advance fitness level, then good for them...or the people who skip a day here and there...it's ok to personalize the program. But, when you're just gonna go straight to a 5k straight from week three, completely ignoring 2/3rds of the program, you are no longer doing the program.
I'm not trying to take away the glory that these people deserve. They're running, they're doing it! I just think that in those cases, this is no longer the appropriate subreddit."	t5_2rgoq	True

Day one was hell, and so was every week's day one up to somewhere around week 6. Last time I ran was on Friday and I did W7D2's 25 minute run. Today I planned to do day 3 and just run for 25 minutes while being a bit more badass than Friday and picking up the pace a bit. But instead of picking up the pace (I went slower than I did on Friday) I increased my badass-ness by adding 5 minutes to my running, meaning I ran for 30 minutes straight! I JUST DID A WEEK 9 RUN! I MADE IT TO THE END! I still find it hard to believe that I am actually able to do that, especially considering that three months ago I almost died running for a minute at a time. Also, if you would've told me back then that I would actually finish this thing, I would have laughed in your face. But hey, here I am, able to run 30 minutes at a time.

I had been doing every week twice, so tonight was supposed to be w5d2-2, but I made a deal with myself that I would try to go for 20 minutes and if i didnt make it, as long as I did at least 8+8, I would count it as w5d2 and do w5d3 next run. 

But I had seen so many posts from people who successfully completed w5d3 when they didnt think they would and that most of it was mental blocks at that point than physical inability that I knew I could do it if I just didnt psych myself out. 

I set the speed for .1mph slower than I have been running and told myself I had to go for at least 5-6 songs before I was even allowed to uncover the timer. I checked after 5 songs and I was right at 25:10!

I updated my fb about it while still on the treadmill haha. A couple minutes later, someone commented on it and it was at that moment it *really* sank in. 

For the first time **ever** *in my life* I **ran** for twenty minutes *without stopping*

1363703793.0	1aleab	50 Running tips for beginners	julez413	155	16	68	"I found this on a blog called [Back on Pointe](http://backonpointe.tumblr.com/post/29709655551/smartgirlsanddumbbells-health-freeak-running), just to give credit where it's due. Some great tips on the list. Hope you guys all find it helpful!

Running Tips:

1.	Wear spandex shorts under your regular running shorts so you donât chafe
2.	Cotton socks will only lead to blisters; invest in socks designed for running.
3.	Join your local running clubâcheck with your local running store fitness center and/or recreation department to find one
4.	Find a committed running partner. It is much harder to skip a run when you have someone else depending on you
5.	Remember that- It gets easier.
6.	Accept and appreciate the fact that not every single run can be a good one
7.	Do not compare yourself to others. Run within yourself and for yourself first.
8.	Even a bad run is better than no run at all
9.	If you normally run with music try skipping it and listening to your feet to hear your pace and your gait
10.	Donât be discouraged if you donât experience weight loss immediately
11.	Start a running blog, to see your progress and set goals
12.	Hydrate. Make it a habit to drink water throughout the day
13.	On long runs eat something every hourâwhether you feel like it or not
14.	During longer runs if you donât like to carry water take some cash in your pocket pouch or a shoe wallet. Run a route where thereâs a corner store that you can use as a pit stop to pick up your water and maybe use the bathroom
15.	To aid recovery the most crucial time to eat and drink is in the hour immediately after you run
16.	Use Vaseline or BodyGlide wherever things rub. They will help prevent blisters and chafing
17.	Do not increase your mileage more than 10 percent per week
18.	If you are prone to shin splints and lower leg pain try running soft trails for your Training runs and save the asphalt for race day
19.	Do not run two hard days back-to-back
20.	Ice aches and pains immediately
21.	Pay attention to your form. Try to run lightly to minimize impact that could lead to injury
22.	When running donât forget the bug spray, sunscreen and a hat- BIG TIME!
23.	Neosporin (or another antibiotic cream) is good for chafed areas
24.	Make sure you cut your toenails short enough so they donât jam into your Shoes
25.	Be careful about running on paths that force you to run consistently on a slant. Itâs hard on the hips knees
26.	Donât stretch before a run. Warm up by walking briskly or jogging slowly for several minutes
27.	Do not ice for more than 20 minutes at a time
28.	For beginners, set mini goals to keep you motivated. (Can be minutes [run 5, walk 10], run between street lights then walk between street lights, run till the next bus stop, until you pass a car on the street)
29.	Do not use the hot tub after a race. It will increase inflammation and hinder healing
30.	Be aware of cyclists approaching you from behind and try to keep to the right. Try to pay special attention when running with music
31.	Run facing traffic.
32.	Never assume a car sees you
33.	Double-knot your shoe laces so they will not come undone when you run\
34.	If you listen to music, put earbuds in the go inside your ear, if you are using the ones that sit in your ear, it will fall out
35.	Buy yourself some actual running shoes from an actual running store because running in junk âsneakersâ will destroy your feet and your legs
36.	At first keep your runs short and slow to avoid injury and soreness so you do not quit.
37.	If you are breathing too hard slow down or walk a bit until you feel comfortable again
38.	Pick your route close to home (out your front door)âthe more convenient it is the better chance you will have sticking with it.
39.	Set realistic short term and long term goals
40.	Remember Soreness one to two days after a run is normal (delayed onset muscle soreness).
41.	Thereâs no shame in walking
42.	Four laps around the local the high school track equals one mile
43.	Vary your training routes. This will prevent boredom and prevent your body from getting acclimated
44.	Push through rough spots by focusing on the sounds of your breath and feet touching the ground
45.	Do abdominal breathing to get rid of side cramps
46.	Run on trails if at all possible. It will be easier on your body and youâll love it
47.	Dress as if it is 10 degrees warmer than the temperature on the thermometer
48.	Run early in the morning or later in evening to avoid mid-day heat
49.	To keep cool in hot weather soak a bandana in cold water wring it out a bit and tie it loosely around your neck
50.	In the winter dress in layers (coolmax or other technical clothing) and wear a headband over your running hat to cover your ears

1357965323.0	16f7kb	6 months ago I gave birth. 3.5 months ago I started C25K. This is what I accomplished today!	rosamor86	166	27	19		t5_2rgoq	False
1328468861.0	pc3nk	No excuses.  290lbs and just completed couch-to-5k.	Litre	150	6	28	"**Background**

After getting word from my doctor that at the age of 32, I had stage-2 hypertension, I decided it was time to change my life.  I obviously knew I was obese, but I hadn't always been that way.  In high school, I played football and baseball and averaged out between 180-190lbs @ 6'2"".  Not too terrible.  It was after graduation that I started packing on the pounds.

Like many people of my generation, I grew up in front of a Nintendo, a TV and a computer.  After I graduated, I abandoned my active lifestyle and made entertainment my main time-passer when not at work.  To compound the issue, I have a desk-job, where I'm literally tied to my desk 7-8 hours a day.  Those that work in a call-center understand what I'm talking about.

So, October of 2011 rolled around and my employer established a new health-screening incentive in order to receive a significant discount on our out-of-pocket health insurance costs.  It made sense, but I was uneasy about it.  I figured ignorance was bliss, and at such a young age, there wasn't anything that could possibly be wrong with me.
I went in, got my new weight (335lbs), my blood pressure (192 over 102), and then proceeded into the exam room to wait for the doctor and the inevitable bad news.  She let me know what I already knew.  If I didn't change my lifestyle, I wasn't going to live to see much past 40-or-50 years old.  This hit me hard, but in a very good way.

I'm a very goal-oriented person, and I'd already heard of couch-to-5k in passing from more active co-workers.  They had suggested it in passing, and I'd blown it off.  I decided to take a peek and since I'd already purchased a treadmill years ago (which, at this point, doubled as a coat-hanger), I settled on the couch-to-5k treadmill version.
I moved the treadmill from a storage room in the house, into the living room right in front of the TV.  I had no excuse not to exercise as my doctor prescribed.  Before starting couch-to-5k, I wanted to find a pace that worked for me.  I have a family history of bad knees, and as football taught me, shin splints as well.  I knew that if I overdid it, hurt myself, or simply couldn't complete a day or week in the program, I'd become disheartened and lose interest.  I settled on 4mph.

Now, this is obviously well below a 30-minute 5k pace, but it was more important for me to complete the program than to worry about actually physically running three miles.  My goal was (and is) to complete three miles as soon as I finished the program.  And so, I set off.  Here are some thoughts I did a rough journal on, over the program:

* Week 1 - With the pace I've selected, I'm easily completing each day this week
* Week 2 - Only 30-seconds longer.  This week has gone by easily as well.  The last intervals are a bit tougher, but nothing too overwhelming
* Week 3 - Three-minute runs are daunting, but I'm completing them
* Week 4 - The five-minute runs are tough, but I'm more concerned about day three of next week.  How can I possibly move from what I'm doing now, to a full 20-minute run?
* Week 5 - What is this sorcery?  I've steadily moved up in my run times, and against all of my apprehensions, I've completed week 5, day 3.  I ran for 20-minutes.  HUGE!
* Week 6 - Since I did my 20-minute run, I feel like the rest of this program is downhill.  Every day this week was just fine.
* Week 7 - Three 25-minute runs.  They went off without a hitch.  Dare I say, this is actually getting a bit easier with each passing run?
* Week 8 - 28-minutes.  No sweat.  Just three minutes longer than last week.
* Week 9 - Day 1 I got horrible shin pain on my left leg.  I had to take an extra day to recoup.  Day 2 helped me figure out what I was doing wrong (running pigeon-toed).  Day 3 went great, and was extremely liberating!

**Lessons learned**

* Get a good pair of shoes.  I was using some four-year-old tennis shoes when I started out.  I was exhausted after exercising.  After finding a good pair of shoes, and a knowledgeable salesperson, we found a pair of shoes that worked very well.  Worth the investment if you're serious about this!
* Chaffing hurts!  Buy compression shorts, spandex, or something.  For bigger people, your thighs rubbing together is a bad thing.  
* The largest hurdle you're going to encounter is yourself.  This isn't an easy endeavor, especially for a heavy person.  You CAN do it.  Injuries, sickness, discomfort - these are all things that will happen occasionally.  Your brain will be steadfast in telling you to stop, or help you come up with convenient excuses not to proceed. 
* The biggest mental and physical hurdle for me was week 5, day 3.  I couldn't foresee being able to run for 20-minutes with my weight in mind.  It was a lot easier than I imagined it would be.  Couch-to-5k builds endurance where I didn't think it could.  Trust in the program.  It really works.
* Remember: The only person that can tell you that you can't do this is yourself.  You don't have to listen.
* Endeavoring to complete couch-to-5k will build your confidence.  I feel better than I have in years.  As a direct result, I believe, I interviewed for and was offered a promotion.  I was confident in the interview, and even talked about my C25K journey.

**Future plans**

* Speed.  I need to increase my speed.  I'm working with a physical trainer friend of mine, and we have a plan to slowly, but steadily increase my pace to the 5-5.5MPH range by the time I run my first official 5k (end of March).  We may or may not get there, but I'm going to try and I'm going to do so in a safe manner so as to not injure myself.
* Actually running three miles.  This week I'm going to do another two days of 30-minutes @ 4MPH just to establish that as my baseline and to create a bit more endurance.  On the third day, I'm going to a track and am going to run three miles to get my base 5k time.  My plan is to run the three miles once a week to monitor my pace, and the other two days, I'll be on the treadmill.  Week-after-next, I'm going to up the incline to 1%.  The weeks following, I'll bump up in .2 to .4 increments and monitor/adjust accordingly.  This will be a dynamic process and I understand that my goals may outpace my actual ability, so I'll scale increases as they're appropriate.
* Run a 5k.  As stated above, I've registered for and will run my first 5k in March
* Train for and run a 10k.  My wife and I are registering for a local ""dirty-dash"".  While not a legitimate 10k, it is around 5-6 miles, and looks like a hell of a lot of fun.  This is scheduled for August, and depending on how that goes, I'll sign up for an official 10k.
* Shed the pounds.  I've lost 45lbs so far.  I have a long way to go, and diet needs to be a more significant part of my focus.  As I've lost weight, I've found the running sessions to go a lot smoother.

I work at a hospital and my shifts are 6pm-2:30am typically.  If I'm ever up early its to do errands or help out my family.  The only time I can squeeze this in comfortably is after work and before going to sleep.

I do my 5 minute warmup, stop to stretch at a bench, and put on the latest Joe Rogan podcast.  I'm slightly apprehensive about the 20 minute thing but the mathematician in me knows if I could do the two 8 minute runs I can do this. I took my usual route through my neighborhood except at the 5 minute mark decided to change it up a bit and go down a street I know is essentially a very long cul-de-sac shape that will take up most of the rest of the jog.  Apparently this was a mistake.  

On my way back out, around the 14 minute mark I am approached by a squad car who signals me to take my headphones off ...

""Just joggin' huh?"" 
""Yeah. ""

""You live around here?"" ""Yes sir."" 

""Where?"" ""XX St."" (4 blocks south) 

""You like those shoes?"" ""Yeah, they're great!"" (I wear Vibram Five-Fingers)

""Alright...just lettin ya know someone called the cops on ya."" ""Wow. Alright then.  'night officer.""

He drives off, along with another car that was driving about 100 feet behind. I don't really think much of it as this isn't the first time something like that has happened (never when out for a run though).

At the 19:30 mark a third squad car, different officer flags me down and this time I had to slow down to a walk (the other guy just kinda kept up with me at my pace).  I figure I'm almost done and he's just checking up to make sure I actually live around here, but then he comes out with:

""Hey man I got the heads up from the other patrols on my way over here, turns out we had a second, separate person also call ya in, saying you were suspicious looking.""  ""Ah (breath) Jeez.""

""Yeah...sorry about that man, I'm sure you know how people are.  Just make sure and get home soon as you're done.""  ""Will do officer.""

""Alright, have a good night.  You really like those shoes, huh?"" ""Yeah, they're pretty (breath), cool!  'night.""

Yeah so, the run itself was no problem.  Feels pretty good.  Trying not to let the reality of living in a mostly white suburban neighborhood while being not-white get to me.  I mean, I get it, but it still kinda sucks.

Did my 1st 5K today :)	katbaleu99	137	10	10	Wish I could say it was good but must confess it was the worst experience I've had all during my C25K training. Unfortunately my left hip joint was hurting for some unknown reason, before I even started the race. Became unbearably sore by the time I got to the half way point so I ended up walking the 2nd half. Through out the 9 weeks of C26K training my hips never once bothered me and I felt fine up until about a half hour before the race when I noticed my hip was feeling sore. Not discouraged though, just learned an important lesson of being more careful next time I run a 5K race. :) Don't run if you're sore before you even start. :}	t5_2rgoq	True

1348627312.0	10hjcx	I have just one run left before completing this program. To all those just starting, here's what I've learned so far...	ilovepills	127	12	32	"First and foremost, I must apologize for the length of this post. I've tried to be as thorough as possible but I'm obviously not very good at brevity. However, I have highlighted the key points for all of you TL;DR-ers out there.

Secondly, and most importantly: Know that you can finish this program. I remember being discouraged by all of the ""week 7"" and ""week 9"" tags next to people's names. I never imagined I'd be where I am today just a few weeks ago. You can do it.

On my first day of college, our psychology teacher told us (I'm paraphrasing):

&gt; Showing up is 80% of passing. Just show up to class.

Short and simple, but true. I firmly believe that in order to succeed in anything in life, this program included, you have to get off of your ass and do it. You're going to have days you don't want to do your scheduled run but I can **promise** you that you will be glad you got out there and did it.

**Disclaimer**: This is what has worked for me. I understand that what I say will not apply to everyone so take what I say with a grain of salt.

**Me**: 28/5'10""/m. I started the program at 245 and I'm currently 230, which I attribute mostly to proper diet. I've never been athletic and I've never been a runner. I've always been the funny fat kid.

1. **Clothes**: As a fat man, I'm a (big) advocate of compression shorts and running socks. Both are typically made of some combination of polyester and spandex as cotton will retain moisture and cause chafing and blisters. I've purchased them at Academy and Target so I can only assume you should be able to source them locally if you choose not to buy them online.

2. **Diet**: I have always given myself at least 3 hours after eating before running and I also do not drink any water within 30-60 minutes prior. You shouldn't need to bring water with you during such a short workout but you should ensure you're well-hydrated prior to leaving the house.

3. **Speed**: It is irrelevant. It is irrelevant. It is absolutely irrelevant. This program is designed to get you to run a 5K and has absolutely nothing to do with how quickly you can finish. If you run a sub 10-minute mile, great. If you run a 13+ minute-mile, great. You're running, and that's all that matters.

4. **Shoes**: This is a hot-button issue in the running world. I went to a New Balance store where I was fit with a pair of shoes that I love. They were $150 so the skeptic in me can't help but think I was taken for a ride, but the bottom line is that they've worked perfectly for me. Just know that you're going to hear proponents and opponents of doing the same and that you're ultimately going to have to make the decision for yourself.

5. **Form**: I'm too lazy to dig-up the YouTube video I based my form around but I can summarize it pretty easily: Utilize a small, quick stride wherein you land on your mid-foot or the balls of your feet, under your body. Meaning, don't use a long stride that causes you to land on your heels. Have your arms bent at a 90 degree angle and try to minimize movement of your torso. Your hands should never cross the midline of your chest.

6. **Failure**: Failure was the best thing to happen to me in this program. I made it W6D3 without failing a single run and because I had W5D3 under my belt, I knew nothing could stop me. The truth is, I was physically able to complete the run. I just had a shitty run, which **will** happen to you. But you've just got to get back out there and do it again. Though I pouted and moped around, feeling like a complete failure for the rest of that evening, I woke up the next morning knowing that I could do it. I took two days off and kicked W6D3's ass.

You absolutely can finish this program but you're going to have to get out there and do it. I'd be willing to bet the majority of failures in this program are those who have simply given in to laziness and decided not to lace up their running shoes.

I sincerely wish you all good luck and good health. This community has been a huge motivator for me and has no-doubt contributed to my success.

In fact, the significance of today is that it's my 1 year anniversary from having started the c25k program. It was tough and at times I didn't know if I was going to complete it. I was (and still am) obese, I suffered shin splints, stitches in the side, I failed a few of the runs and I missed a few scheduled runs here and there. I struggled with the right foods to eat, how to properly hydrate, staying motivated and many of the challenges that I see people posting here about, but I stuck to it and though the road at one time appeared too treacherous for me, I conquered this program.

Now, here I am one year later to tell you guys that I've moved on to having completed organized 5k runs, 5k mud run (Warrior Dash), 10k mud run (Original Mud run), Sprint triathlon, Olympic Triathlon, Half-marathon, Half-marathon obstacle race (Spartan Beast) and even a Full marathon trail run. It all began with the decision to make the first step in the c25k program and I hope I can provide some encouragement to anyone struggling that it can be done and you can do it.

I saved the most important event for last and that is that I participated in a Half-Ironman distance Triathlon. I'm proud to say I failed to complete the event. I am proud because in the face of failure I can look at myself proudly in the mirror and know that if there is nothing I fail at in life, then I'm not trying hard enough. I continue to push myself and you can too, so for anyone out there struggling or telling yourself you can't do this, I want to come here and say YES YOU CAN.

I posted a couple months ago talking about how I hated running but I was going to stubbornly stick this thing out, and I'm so glad that I did.  I still have little love for running... I especially hate the way it sometimes makes my stomach feel like a bounce house full of fat toddlers.  But, that feeling of accomplishment when you've finished, its a special thing.  Even if I didn't complete my goal for that day, just waking up and getting my ass moving at 6am is a little victory every time.

Two big things helped me finish this, and in this case, being stubborn was a virtue.

- No excuses.  Its raining, its too cold, its too early, its too humid, I'm tired... so what.  You're going to be glad you made yourself get out there when you're done.

- Its as much a mental fight as it is physical.  Every single time I ran, my brain would beg me to stop every step of the way.  Kick those demon thoughts in the nards and press on.  Sometimes they'll win those battle, but as long as you get out there next time, you'll win the war.

If I can do this, I cant imagine there are too many people out there that cant.  I've dropped about 25lbs in the process, down to 268, and I feel better than I have in a really long time.  Feels good, man.

1373468915.0	1i0enf	Great news from Doctor! He is advising I get off my Blood Pressure Meds!	catdecal	126	19	32	"#TL;DR: Read the title.  Doc says I can stop taking my meds!

4 or 5 months ago my blood pressure was dangerously high.  A diastolic reading of 110 - 115 was not uncommon.

My doctor was concerned, ran a bunch of tests and put me on meds.  10mg of lisinopril daily.  I hated that I'd let my self get so out of shape that I needed medication to have a normal BP.  I was very sedentary.  I was not considered ""obese"" but I was ""overweight.""

I committed to eat better and start exercising.  Eating better was easy as I've done that before, and it helped some.  Was able to decrease my dosage to 5mg.

On April 22nd, I decided it was time to get serious and get moving.  It was a Monday.  I downloaded the app and said, ""I'll start this up on Saturday.""  But after a few minutes I realized that was just procrastinating and would lead to not doing it at all, so I threw on some shorts and did W1D1. 

After about 4 weeks I had another check up and he was able to lower my dosage to 2.5mg, which is the lowest available dosage of this medicine.  

Today at my check up, I was at 100/70, with pulse rate of 55.  He wants me to get totally off my meds for two weeks to see where it stabilizes.

When I started this program, I hated running. HATED. At the smallest mention of running, I would tell anyone who would listen how I would rather do ANYTHING instead of running. 

I don't know what it was that pushed me to start your program- probably because of how my husband would literally lap me several times whenever we went for a ""run"" together (Him running and my sulking). But now, I wanted to do something for me. I wanted to prove that I was strong, and if I worked hard and set my mind to something, I could do it.

I just got back from my first full 5k run. Yes, it took me a while (40 minutes). But I did it. Throughout this program, I never once walked when I was supposed to be running. I never once let rain or pain stop me from getting my bum off the couch. I showed myself that I can do something, even when it's hard.

So, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for leading me down the path of badassery and for helping me learn to love running!

Love you always,

Anchorgirl :)"	t5_2rgoq	True

So I tried to go out and jog and was not even able to finish 1/4 of a mile without feeling like death. After that I did some research and learned more about C25K. I always seen it mentioned on this page but never looked too much into it. I liked the idea of it and decided to try it out.

I picked up the Couch-to-5K app for the Droid which only cost a couple of dollars. Made up a sound track with some of my favorite upbeat, feel-good songs. Put on my running shoes, and went out to complete Week1Day1 of the program.

I was exhausted and out of breath before I even reached the halfway point, couldn't jog another step, but decided to just walk the rest of the way until the program was finished. I felt pretty bad about it and the next day was even worse. I was so sore from the first run I couldn't reach the half way point and gave up early, didn't even walk the rest of the way.

But I stuck with it and after that I would get a little bit further each time, and today I have finally completed Week1Day1. I never thought it would be this difficult before I started, but I am so happy I stuck with it.

I can only get better from here on out."	t5_2rgoq	True

Not sure if it was the best choice, but since my work schedule is a bit crazy this week,  I needed to do W5D1 and W5D2 in 2 consecutive days if I wanted to keep my routine beginning on Fridays (yes, I have a weird work schedule).

That didn't stop me as I powered through the 8 minute run like it was nothing!  Ok so maybe I'm lying just a bit - it was pretty damn tiring.  In the end though, it really didn't seem that bad!  

I started getting a bit off track in terms of my diet that I've been utilizing - must remember - diet complements exercise, it does not overcome it.

I feel a little embarrassed talking about it, as if I'm bragging, and maybe I am a little. But I feel like I need to get some of it out.

I'm 26, 6'2''. I've been fat all my life. I've been as heavy as 380 pounds and that's just the highest I've seen on a scale, I may have been heavier after that. I started Couch to 5k at a slim 320 pounds, with a bad knee from football in high school among other issues. I've also been doing the 100 pushups plan and I'm currently up to week 2 day 3 column 3 of that. 

I was always one of the kids in school who couldn't finish the mile run in a reasonable time, so to run for 20 minutes straight and something like 2 miles was a huge accomplishment. 

I've had a few problems with running the program. Two days after a successful week 4 day 1 run with some minor but noticeable pain in the back of my ankles, I woke up with some kind of absolutely debilitating ankle and inner foot pain that killed my plans for running for the rest of the week. With Week 5 day 3, I failed the first time I tried, instead choosing to walk quite a bit of the run because I felt a very similar pain. This time, though, I managed to push through and succeed.

The change is pretty large. I'm amazed that I actually feel *good* after running rather than just like complete sweaty fat shit like I used to. (I still feel sweaty and fat, but at least not completely.) I had a beautiful nap afterwards and woke up feeling refreshed.

I've always been shy and anxious, but since I've been running I managed to meet a girl who calls me ""hot"" and I began renting a room from a beautiful woman who actually mentioned that I look ""great"" and-- this was a shock-- ""muscular."" 

Muscular? Fat-bellied, moob-cursed me?

Every run is a bitch and a half and despite the sidebar that suggests you shouldn't be winded, I am constantly winded. I won't claim the program is ""easy."" But my body type is definitely not that of a runner's naturally-- more fitted to pushing heavy things or people around-- and I am managing to get through it. I can hardly imagine someone less likely to run a 5k, but it's getting closer, and like I said, if I can do it, you can too.

As someone with a torrid history with video games, it helps me to think about each week as a level, and beating level 5 feels like taking down the first of the Wily stages in a Mega Man game.

1373526241.0	1i2evb	Yesterday I ran a 33 minute 5k. Today I ran a 7:16 mile. All thanks to C25K!! Here are some lessons I've learned.	MollFlanders	106	11	38	"I'm so thrilled I can barely contain myself. This is my first time measuring a mile time since middle school, and back then I was averaging between 10:15 and 12:30 with lots of walking. I just ran a 7:16 mile!! I didn't even push myself at any point to get a better time. I just went the pace I felt most comfortable at for such a distance. 

On my C25K journey I've learned a few things which I figure I might as well share if they could help others make as much progress as I have:

* I know you see this one a lot, but run slow. Seriously. Grandpa shuffle your way to success. Building distance is much more important than building speed; the speed will come naturally. I learned that today.

* Don't be afraid of running in the heat. As long as you're properly hydrated, running during the warmer parts of the day will basically make your workout that much more intense. Then when you're running in cooler weather, you'll find that it seems SO easy.

* Side achesâ I used to suffer from these pretty chronically, and tried every breathing/stretching technique you've heard of to alleviate them. The cure? Calming the fuck down. Once I stopped worrying about using X or Y trick to make it go away and just tried to think about something else and let my body do its thing, it sorted itself out. I never try to ""regulate"" my breathing anymore. Don't interfere with what your body wants to do!

* Believe in the program. Nine weeks ago, I *never* thought I would be able to run a full mile, let alone in 7:16. I *certainly* never thought that I would be able to run a 5k. But I can!! I have!! Just take the program one day at a time and you will be fine. You will be more than fine! You will be amazing!

I was upset at first, but you know what? They clearly don't understand why I'm doing this. I'm not particularly big (5'3"" at 145 lbs - definitely overweight but not too bad), but I can barely walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath. This isn't for losing fat; this is for gaining stamina. I want to play intramural soccer with my friends.

Since 2009 I've lost about 60lbs, putting me about 40lb from my goal. I've been stuck here for about two years.

I started c25k back in May, and have taking each week slowly, repeating days and weeks until I was satisfied enough with my progress to move on. I've been focusing on time, rather than distance, figuring I would work towards distance once I could run 30 minutes in a row without stopping. In June, I added a gym membership and started weight training four days a week. Before June, I'd never even been in a gym outside of high school, from which I graduated back when reality TV was televised surgery on The Learning Channel.

I finished W8D3 on Monday, running about 2.5 miles in 28 minutes. Last night, I was set to run for 30 minutes. But about halfway through my run I decided I was going to run until I had completed a 5k - distance over time. It wasn't easy, but I pushed through and at the end I had completed a 3.1 mile run in 38:05!

As I was almost done with W6D1 I decided to throw in the towel... On the walking section! At my cool down I realized I was within .4 miles of a 5k, and I took off running. I ended up running 3.15 miles in 34 minutes. In May I could barely run for 1 minute straight. This program works better than I ever thought possible. 	t5_2rgoq	True
1373985049.0	1iexvn	I finished. None of my original goals were reached.	bestheimerdingerNA	96	6	18	"I just got home from my Week 9 Day 3 run. It was a great night for a run--a mild 71 degrees out, low humidity, and a little breeze that seemed to kick up at the exact right times. I was able to run at a great pace through the whole thing, and although I took a week off earlier this month due to shin splints, my shins feel wonderful right now. I finished Couch 25k. 

Nine weeks ago, I set some goals for this program. I was going to lose 15 pounds. I was going to hit that single digit bodyfat that has somehow evaded me for all these years. I was going to run a sub 21 minute 5k (ok, yes, I was a little naive about running). I was going to be a shredded athletic guy for my upcoming vacation, and I was going to be a frontrunning beast when I showed up to my first 5k run. I was going to force myself through the program, work my butt off, hate every second of it, and live a success story.

It just didn't happen. I didn't lose 15 pounds; I lost five pounds. Six pack? Not even close. I still have plenty of fat around my midsection. I got nowhere *near* the 21 minute 5k, as my best time was 29 minutes. I failed completely. I mean, none of this surprises me--I knew at Week 7 I was never going to hit these ridiculous goals that I set. I thought that I would end the program disappointed and depressed, but after tonight, I have realized something: I have never felt as enthusiastic about and invigorated by an activity as I have about running. I have succeeded on another level.

Around Week 8, I noticed something that I couldn't understand: I was looking forward to running. I *liked* running. I mean, it's insane. Around Week 5 I had to force myself to put on my shoes and get out the door. I would come home limping and exhausted. During the final stretch I would have to dig deep even at a snail's pace to work through it. Suddenly, everything changed around the halfway point of my W8D2 run. I realized that I wasn't even tired--that I was enjoying the serenity of just keeping a pace, enjoying the outdoors, and taking laps around the park. A little while later, when Constance said ""Walk,"" I felt disappointed that the run was over. I honestly wanted to keep going.

It was a big changing point for me. I really feel that I just want to run for the sake of running. Yes, I'd like to get faster, and yes, I'd like to shed off those few extra pounds, but it's not even a real issue to me. Right now, I just want to run. Nothing before has ever made me feel as good about myself.

TL;DR: the program can have unexpected results. Whatever you set out to do, don't forget about running for the sake of running! The happiness it brings may sneak up on you."	t5_2rgoq	True
1370777790.0	1fz6vm	Not the most impressive, but I just finished W1D1 of pre-C25k.	XDer	100	15	22	"I'm about 405 pounds (not positive because I'm too heavy for my scale to weigh me now) and I'm really just ready for a change. I've been in shape before and all that good stuff, but depression and numerous injuries over the years have caused my to balloon up--most recently, I shredded my left ankle, and so I have to start slow.

I felt okay. I wasn't super out of breath. I was actually mostly bored. However, a slow start will hopefully do two things: condition my ankle to physical activity again, and prevent me from burning my legs out. It's not easy to run when you're as large as I am.

Anyway, I'm trying to be as positive as I know how to be, so thank you guys for listening to me, and I hope that everyone has a great run today."	t5_2rgoq	True

I still can't believe it. My goal was to get under 30m, and as I rounded the final bend and the finish line came into sight, I steeled myself to be ready for the clock to be just over 30m.

It was at 29:20.  I don't think I've ever run so fast to cross a finish line in my life. I even heard someone in the crowd say ""Damn, he's in a hurry.

This is the first exercise program/training I've ever done that wasn't as a part of a team or class, and the reward is so much more worth it when you push yourself to do it for you. All those late night runs after work in the cold of winter, all those Friday nights spent running and not out being social...all worth it. So very, very worth it.

A little back story:
July 5th 2012 I was a staggering 390lbs. Got down to about 335 on diet alone, decided it was time to get moving (or jiggling, as it were). So after cruising r/loseit, I saw a lot of talk about C25K. Decided to give it a shot.
So on October 31st i had the last cigarette of my life, and jumped on the treadmil..... 
As a former athlete I knew the drill, but 6 years removed from athletics really snuck up on me. Add to that the fact that  have had 3 major knee operations, oh boy. Nonetheless, I set my walk at 3.0mph and my runs at 5.0mph.
Slowly but surely the huffing and puffing added up, I found myself actually succeeding at this. Holy cow!
Maybe its the sado-masachist inside me, but I always crank the treadmil up to 6.5 mph in the last minute to really fishish strong, and punish myself for all those twinkies I had eaten over the years. 
Regardless, here I stand, still fat, allbeit less so, and a non smoker for over 2 months, able to run 30 minutes non stop at 5mph. No, it isn't quite 3 miles, but I'll get there. I know I will, because beyond the physical triumphs, I've become tremendously more confident in my own abilities in all aspects of life. 

TL;DR
300lb man quit smoking and stated running.

Ever since I went on a super lazy cruise with my boyfriend for his birthday, it seemed like I wasn't getting anything done.

I had been in the middle of Week 4 when we left, and since I had gotten back I hadn't run. I was really upset that I was slacking off and I had no motivation. And I was worried I had lost all progress.

Today, though, I said ""Atty, suck it up and stop being a little baby!"" and I got on that treadmill and I ran and I ran to prove to myself that I hadn't lost it.

When I decided that it was time to slow to a walk, I about pooped myself when I looked down to see that I had ran just a little over 10 minutes straight. My body still felt great, but my chest was starting to get a little tight so I slowed. 

I feel awesome and I'm so glad I didn't just give up. My only question is: where do I stand on the C25K program now? Should I continue with Week 4 or do I need to move up a week or so?

I never bothered to run at any point in my life, I was lazy. A couch potato. I've lost weight before now but never through exercise. To my surprise I've just found myself running for 30 minutes straight and ~4km due to this program, I couldn't even run 30 seconds 6 weeks ago.

That's another shock I ran my 30 minutes by accident I was to do week 6 day 3 today. My timer broke on my phone so I just ran. Got to 30 minutes and the only reason I stopped is due to pain in my foot where my shoe insoles were rubbing. ( I've made an appointment to sort it out). I can't believe it.

So basically if you think nah this program isn't for me, I'm to large or I'm too slow, I'm asthmatic or I have to have insoles. Right now I am living proof you can do it.
It is hard I won't lie but I tell you something it is the most worthwhile thing I have ever done. I believe I'm a runner now and you can be too.

I'm going to keep running, I want to build up my pace and run 5km :) once I do that I'll move to B210K and I cannot wait.

**5K, 33:21**

Here I am, running my 28 min route. Around the 5 min mark everything is going normal. Around the 10 min mark I realize I'm making excellent time, feel no pain or fatigue at all, and decide to go for it.

15 min mark passes and I still feel strong, then the 20 min mark, and the entire time I'm keeping my pace up. I start to realize I can and should up my pace if I want a nice time, so I do... and around 26 min I get stuck at a traffic light, killing ALL my momentum. :(

28 min mark (runkeeper tells me my run is over. NO ITS NOT) and I'm constantly fighting my habit of slowing down out of routine. 30 min mark and the 5K mark is within sight. Part of me wants to run it down, part of me wants to sprint it down. I contain my excitement and just enjoy the moment.

Cruised to a stop, and for the first time since W1D1 I finished the run with **no** muscle pain, **no** joint pain, **no** tendon or ligament pain at all. Wasn't out of breath, wasn't dying of thirst, wasn't drenched in sweat. I felt on top of the world.

It felt like there was no possible way I could make it to the end of the time, and I stopped early at least once each run. I was gasping for breath, I couldn't control my form, and I was miserable. My dad ran with me a few days ago, saw me struggling, and said ""You need to slow down."" 

So today, I did, and what a DIFFERENCE! Today's run was easy. No crazy struggling, I kept my form in check, and best of all, I felt like I could run forever. I finished W4D3 today, and instead of the the last 5-minute run, I ran almost 9 minutes. Uphill. I could have never done that at my old pace. So if you're struggling, try slowing down just a bit. It seems so silly now that all I had to do was cut back a little, but I'm so glad I did. "	t5_2rgoq	True

Since that day, I've been going out three times a week, trying to build up the strength to do w1d1. I stuck with only running 30 seconds of every 60 second run, and it worked well for me for a couple of weeks.  Then I tried alternating 30 and 45 second runs for a week. The next week, alternating 45 and 60 second runs. 
Today, I attempted the real thing- all 8 60 second runs.

This program hasn't been easy, but it is doable if you put in the time and effort, good luck to everyone else, you have no idea how amazing it feels to complete something like this.

Best advice I ever saw on here...don't put in a timeline of when you plan on doing this, just get out there and do it, today, right after work, the moment you have 30 minutes of free time, just go do it, and then 2 days later, do it again etc, etc, trust me you wont regret it.

I hit the little random button at the top of the page and I was brought here.  I ran in high school but now, at 33 and with 4 kids I was not exactly in shape. Every time the news talked about America's obesity problem I felt guilty.  I didn't want my kids growing up with a fat dad. I began C25K at 220 pounds (I'm only 5'5"") and ached after the first few sessions.
  By the time week 5 came around I dreaded the 20 minute run.  I failed.  I stopped 1 minute and 13 seconds short.  I took three days off and tried again.  I couldn't BELIEVE how easy it was the second time.  I had to force myself to stop running! After that things were much easier.  I never had a run I couldn't finish.
  I was forced off the trail for a week at week 6 with the worst case of hemorrhoids ever...  Today I finished my last run and I feel amazing.  I haven't weighed myself since week 7, then I was down 20+ pounds.  Right now I am wearing a t-shirt that hasn't fit me since college.
 My wife has picked up the program and I look forward to running with her (if someone will sit with the kids for while!) In addition to running I have changed my diet.  I haven't had a soda since I started the program. Dessert once a week and no fast food.  My portions are smaller and I feel amazing.  I can't wait to go in for my check up at the end of the month.

1369929272.0	1fcc2x	Please read the basics about running injuries	DarxusC	85	9	18	"I keep seeing people posting about getting injured doing c25k.  Something like 80% of runners get injured every year.  Most from doing too much too soon, and in most cases it can be prevented from becoming a full blown injury by taking a few days off when it starts to hurt.  So a few days off now instead of potentially months off later.  If you run, I really think you should take the time to read a couple articles about running injuries.  And I really think it's irresponsible that the coolrunning couch to 5k plan (and many others) doesn't say this.

I think these two articles are a great option, I'm curious if others would recommend something else as a minimum:

http://www.runnersworld.com/health/big-7-body-breakdowns?page=single

""At the first sign of an atypical pain, take three days off."" - http://www.runnersworld.com/health/10-laws-injury-prevention?page=single

I think it would be worth asking the coolrunning folks to add something like this.  And I think the faq here could do better than just the ""CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR"" stuff, which doesn't help much if people have no idea what should and shouldn't hurt, and how much.

I failed miserably, to the point that I made my own tutorial for a three week period, adding in just a couple spurts of running while walking for most of the 30 minutes. I then tried again, and succeeded this time. Each week seemed harder and harder until I got to the dreaded W5D3.

Once I toppled that, jogging started to come more easily as I hit weeks six, seven, eight. Then today was my final run, and I thought to myself why not beat the program, get through 5k before the 40 minutes were up? I had extended my walks on week 8 to end up with 5k in distance, but this was the real test to see if I was up for it.

Managed it in about 39.5 minutes, and honestly I probably could have kept going a bit longer. Never thought I would say that even a month ago, let alone three. This really does work, and I'm glad I did it :) Now to get my time to 30 minutes and sign up for an official 5k!"	t5_2rgoq	True

1356793461.0	15mjbh	Asthmatic or (ex)smoker? Here's some really simple breathing tips for exercise	chocolate_on_toast	87	16	20	"1) If you have a ârelieverâ inhaler (usually blue coloured) such as [Salbutamol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salbutamol#Brand_names), Ventolin, Albuterol, etc. you should take it **ten minutes before you start exercise**. DO NOT wait to take it until you feel short of breath.

2) Deeper, slower breaths are more effective at bringing in oxygen than lots of little shallow breaths. Try to keep your breathing deep and steady when running (I do it by inhaling for 3 or 4 steps, exhaling for 3 or 4 steps).

3) Concentrate on slowly and gently getting air OUT of your lungs. Try to gently exhale as far as you possibly can, try to keep it going as long as possible. Alternate a few normal breaths with gently exhaling all the way out while youâre doing your warm-up. While youâre running, remember that getting old air OUT is the important part; donâtâ worry so much about filling up, focus on breathing OUT stale air to make room for fresh air.

Iâll post explanations in the comments below.

2. I can avoid letting bad days derail me. 
3. I can motivate myself. 
4. My body is worthy of my respect*. More on this below if you care to read. 
5. Accountability is key. I credit this site and RunKeeper for helping me through the rough spots. 

*I am an American woman, which means that I am not immune to the cultural pressures regarding appearance and physique (I'm a bit older, though, so I don't have the 10+ hours of daily media messages pressuring me as I try to make my way in this world and find my identity. I have made my way in the world already, and I know who I am. Nonetheless, I have always felt unworthy and ""not fit enough."" Running changed that for me. I am fit enough for me. I am fit enough to outrun a predator. My body serves me well; it is my most important tool in life. I respect it, I fuel it well, I cherish its capabilities. I look in the mirror and where two months ago I saw sag and bulge and disappointment, I now see power, capability, and strength. This change is largely mental. The sags and bags are still there, but it makes no difference anymore: That body can run, damnit, and it deserves my respect. "	t5_2rgoq	True

I was lucky enough that I never had to repeat a week, but there were days that were incredibly tough for me. I persevered and made it. 

Listening to the advice people gave others on here really helped me. The two biggest pieces of advice that helped me were: Slow down, breathe out longer than you breathe in. Now I can breathe while running and not have to think about it. I don't get winded ever, but when I didn't have advice to follow I would get winded.

I'm nowhere near worn out. Let's keep going to the end of the street."" This then turns into the next street. Another. One more. OK let's get to the main road then stop.


29 MINUTES. I couldn't believe it. I'd smashed through 25 minutes and almost hit week 9! I've been on a high ever since. I'd seen the posts here from people suddenly bursting beyond the constraints of their assigned week but jealously dismissed them as people who were obviously fitter than I when they started this. How else could they find it so much easier? The truth is this thing just works and works absurdly well. All it takes is the willpower to make it happen.

For those interested, I'm a 36 year old male, 5'10"" and currently 210lbs. I still need to lose another 35lbs or so.

1357623705.0	16636v	Wow, I'm done already? This program seriously works.	ruwisc	77	6	10	"These nine weeks have completely flown by.

A little background: If you had used the word ""athletic"" to describe me at any time before this past fall, I would have laughed in your face. When I started C25K I had never run for more than three minutes at a time in my life, and even that was as a kid.

I first encountered C25K last June, before I joined Reddit. At 22, 6'3"" and 274 pounds, I was looking for a way to get into running and thought this would be a good place to start. I went out for W1D1, and... sputtered. I made it to the fourth running interval and had to give up - my body just couldn't take it.

Later in the summer, I found Reddit, and with the help of /r/loseit, started changing up my diet, having completely forgotten about C25K. In October (after losing 40 lbs.), I found this subreddit and managed to convince myself to give it another go. So I went out for another go at week 1, and it went pretty well! I mean... at a couple of points during that week I wanted to throw up, but I powered through and was able to finish.

I can't really pinpoint what my motivation was during the first couple of weeks - it was mostly ""I have no reason *not* to follow the program, I've already done these other days, I might as well keep going."" As you keep going, you get the realization of ""wait, I'm supposed to be able to run a 5K pretty soon... oh, I bet I'll actually be able to do it when the time comes."" And so I did. Week 9 for me was last Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and I went out and did my half-hour each day! And didn't get to a 5K distance. (I may not be fat anymore, but I'm still pretty slow.)

So, I issued myself a challenge: I'll go out on W10D1 and try to run a 5K. If I can do it, awesome! If I can't... I'll go back to half-hours and try to increase my time by a little each time.

...

...and it worked! I ran my first 5K today with a finish time of 38:55! My time isn't particularly impressive, but for a pretty big guy I'll take that any day of the week. I don't think I ever would have been able to accomplish what I have without a C25K schedule and the motivation this subreddit provides. Y'all are pretty swell.

If you've made it this far (and maybe are looking to get started on C25K yourself), have some free advice!

- SLOW DOWN! I know this gets hammered into people's heads around here, but it really is paramount to your success. C25K is about building up endurance, not running at lightning-fast speeds. You'll get faster as the program goes along, just as a function of being in better shape. On my W5D3 run I didn't make it much farther than 2 km in 20 minutes, but it gets easier as it goes on if you don't push yourself so hard.

- If you're doing this to get healthy, make some kind of dietary change too. Something as simple as cutting out soda or fast food or something like that can have huge effects.

- If you fail one day... so? You're still running more than you used to! Just get out there the next time and kick some ass.

- Have fun out there! Improving your way of life doesn't have to be a chore!

You're going to be someones inspiration to start living a healthier lifestyle.  You're going to feel better about yourself.  You're going to have more energy.

1356710325.0	15kr5g	It took me almost two years...but I finally did W5D3.		76	5	17	"I had been on the program before, almost two years ago. Things were going good until I hit W5D3 -- run for twenty whole minutes? With no breaks? Impossible!

I tried, but I couldn't do it. So I went back to W4, and then I tripped and injured my knee, and stopped running for a while. Then I got depressed, then I ate like crap, and (shocker) felt even worse. Wash, rinse, and repeat.

So, eventually, I got sick of feeling awful, and I resolved to get back to it. I put my brace on my knee and got to work. I had been out of it for so long though that even getting through W1 was a struggle at first, and I kept bouncing back and forth between W1 and W2, and not really committing to the program. 

Then probably a couple months ago I really decided that I needed to do this, and buckled down. I finally got to W3, then to W4, and hovered there for a couple weeks.

This week, I finally got back to W5. I could see D3, lurking there, waiting. I remembered how it had precipitated my downfall almost two years ago.

Today, going into it, I was honestly really intimidated. I had, after all, never run 20 minutes in one sitting before *plus* I had all that psychological baggage about it from before. I honestly didn't know if I could do it. My thought to myself when I started running was ""Well, I'll just see how far I can get.""

Turns out, I got the whole way. Towards the end I'm sure other people on the trail probably thought I was crazy because I was telling myself to keep moving, but it provided just enough encouragement to push up the final hill as the last of the twenty minutes ticked by.

It was a surprisingly emotional experience for me. When I finished I had to try to *not* break down and cry (then folks would have certainly thought I was crazy). 

**TL;DR** I'm grateful to this place and you guys and gals for the encouragement. I'm looking forward to starting W6 Monday with the knowledge that a lot of what I thought were my limits aren't really limits at all.

Not bad for an overweight couch potato with sticktoitiveness of a 5 year old with attention deficit disorder. 

Long story short: this weekend we signed up for a 10K run in september and I decided to test my abilities. 
Plan: run out of town for 40 minutes, using intervals of 7 min run / 1 min walk + taking it slow. Then turn back and crawl home if necessary. Hopefully I would make the whole 10K.

I'm using Endomondo to track my runs, but this was the first time to use interval time feature (bought pro for 1â¬) and what I didn't know was that in interval mode it does not announce distance/tempo audibly. No problem, just keep running.

A true former couch dweller, I started this program by hauling my mass out of bed at 5:30 am, three days a week.  I didn't want anyone to see me thump along the sidewalks or hear my obnoxious air sucking.  I wore the same long sleeved hoodie even though by the last third of each session I would be drenched in sweat.  I was too ashamed to show off my flabby arms and back rolls, so I kept them covered.  

I didn't miss a session, even when it rained and when I just felt disgusting and lazy.  I went anyway, and as I did the cooldown walks I felt like I had won something. I'm still fat, but I've made changes to my lifestyle overall and am seeing and feeling some positive results.  Perhaps I will not be fat for too long....

Now I'm technically ""done"" the program, but I will be back out again on Tuesday because I guess I am a runner now.  And if there is one thing I have learned about the people here on the running subreddits, it is that we don't stop.

Gave up cigarettes about a month ago and started running!)

Up until today, I had successfully managed to complete week 5 and had just started week 6. The most I had ever consecutively ran in my entire life was the 20 minutes in week 5, which was on a treadmill at 5.5mph.

Last night, my aunt, who is also a runner and just ran her first half marathon, calls me up and tells me she has an extra number for a 5 mile race in the morning and to meet her at her house at 9am with my running shoes on ready to go. I had just worked a 8 and a half hour shift with no break at my new job as a dishwasher, my feet were killing me, and I knew I couldn't run the whole thing and didn't want to embarrass myself. I told her I would go but would run half and walk the other half. 

I woke up this morning exhausted and the last thing I wanted to do was run. Reluctantly, I ate a banana, filled up a gallon jug, added 3 scoops of Amino X and walked over to her house. We picked up a few of her other runner friends and got over to the race spot. 

I turn on my favorite running album (Lace Up mixtape by MGK) and went at it. I kept my aunt in sight and tried to maintain a steady pace. There was a pretty big hill in the first mile that threw me off, but I kept her in my sights and kept going.

2.5 miles in, I realize I can do this. I wasn't cramping, didn't have any stiches, and felt really good! I tried to be effective by running in straight lines, sticking to the inside of the curves of the road, etc, to shave off some distance and keep up with my aunt. I stayed around 100m behind her the entire time.

At the 4 mile mark, I realized I was going to do it. It didn't even register that I had already ran twice as long as my previous record, not even counting the hills and being on a paved road vs a treadmill. All I could think about was finishing strong and not quitting. I used to put all my effort into scoring a bag, so I owed it to myself to put all my effort in this last mile and do it.

.25 miles left and I speed up a little bit, now I'm running next to my aunt. She was so surprised! She said something like ""Oh my god you're here! I didn't think you were going to be able to run the whole thing!"" We pushed eachother to pick up the pace and finish the last stretch at a good pace.

100m left, I feel so good that I'm sprinting at this point. I feel so loose, so fluid, and it feels effortless. I finish the race.

My time, for my first ever race, being used to running at 5.5mph on a treadmill, was **50 minutes 35 seconds.** I was so happy! I can't explain what an amazing feeling it was to do that at that time. I probably wasn't even in the top half, but I did it, and I didn't quit. I exceeded my own goals and expectations, and I smiled for the rest of the day knowing that.

It's unreal to think that 1 month ago I was smoking half a pack a day and was starting week one thinking ""I'll never be able to do week 2"", and then week two thinking the same about three.

I am officially a graduate of c25k, and I changed my flair to show that. This works if you're committed! 

Just some tips I'll throw out there:

-I've noticed that running in the morning on an empty stomach, or close to it (all I ate was a nanner this morning), stops me from getting a stich in my side. 

-Drinking a lot of water helps a lot! I finished a whole gallon before the race knowing that I needed it if I had a chance. The Amino X might have done something, probably not much. It's a BCAA supplement with Taurine and a few other things. Pretty solid product IMO, not necessary though.

-I've heard someone say if you can run a half marathon, you can run a full one. I guess it's true about a 5k and a 5 mile too! My results probably aren't going to be the same for everyone, but I have NEVER been able to run distance in my entire life, and I did it today by running 3x a week, sometimes more.

Finished W5D3 last night and I have to say I was nervous as hell going into it but I did it.  Nothing seemed to go right at the beginning.  First, hundreds of little kids were practicing football at the school where I was going to run so I had to wait a couple of hours. I then wanted to try the whole audiobook thing but I couldn't get google music to play my audiobook I downloaded in order...grrr toss that idea out. Then I leave the house and the extender I bought for my phone armband (hey fat guy here) wouldn't work as the ring wasn't just the right size and twisted sideways so my armband is once-again a forearm band.

However I wasn't going to let any of this stop me.  I made it to the school at 9:00 and started jogging.  Everything from there was a blur... I just remember saying to myself breathe properly, balls of your feet, steady pace.  When I finally checked my time I only had 5 minutes left. I picked my head up and kept going and before I knew it those last 5 minutes were over.

I just want to say that this program has definitely worked for me so far.  No repeat days yet... I'm not saying that they're not going to happen just they haven't happened yet.  I'm 32 and even though I'm 282 pounds (as of this morning) I'm in the best shape of my adult life.  I made a promise to myself that I'm going to be able to be an active participant in my son's life.  I've lost weight (diet too) and gained some muscle and a ton of endurance.  When I started this program I was barely completing the 60 second runs.  Now, I can't believe I ran 20 minutes straight last night.  I haven't run a mile since junior high school... that's 17 years which is over half my lifetime ago!

I also used endomondo to track distance and speed and I was surprised at the results.  I ran a 7m:13s 1 km and a 12m:02s 1 mile. While I'm no speed demon, I'm more than happy with that 12 minute mile considering it's been 17 years since my last one."	t5_2rgoq	True

Thanks, /r/c25k! 	seasteph26	73	10	6	Without the structure of the Couch to 5K program, I don't think I ever would have had the motivation to train for a 5K!  Here I am on the left:  http://imgur.com/RwaYi.  I started the program in May and finished at the beginning of July.  For the past 4 weeks, I've been working on improving my time, and I really feel stronger now than when I finished the program.  The plan now is to incorporate pilates and yoga (to strengthen my core, good for running!) while running 5K distances for the next month.  Starting in September, I'm starting the /r/b210k program and once that's finished, start training for the Brooklyn Half Marathon.  Even if you struggle a bit now, during the program, stick it out - the rewards are amazing.  That's a genuine grin on my face.  :)  Happy running, everyone!  	t5_2rgoq	True

1371666580.0	1go64a	Dear /r/C25K: Thank you for everything, a few pieces of advice, and where I go from here.	DidntClickGuy	76	13	26	"With the help of all of you, I have been able to complete this program.  I would not have known about it if not for you.  I would never have believed it was possible if I hadn't actually tried it.  Your stories - especially from those of you with the challenges of extra weight, or recovering from injuries, or having physical setbacks I never had to experience - inspired me to push harder and achieve more.  I am now running 5K every time I run, *not* including the warmup and cooldown periods.

It was not easy on some days, but I kept myself from getting discouraged by doing a few things that seemed to help a lot.  Here they are:

* Don't expect anything for your performance except finishing.  That's good enough.  The program challenges you different ways with each day, so don't worry about your speed or distance.  Just get to the finish line.

* Trust the program.  It works.  If you finished W2D2, you've got a really good chance at being able to finish W2D3.  On your rest days, don't run.  When you're supposed to walk, walk.  You're going to make it, just stop trying to outthink the agenda.

* Don't stress yourself out by checking out future runs.  Here's all you have to know: you're going to start by running 90 second intervals, and end by running 30 straight minutes.  But the only details you need to know for now are those for today's run.

* Do, however, check out the details for today's run.  You don't want to be caught off guard.

* Get music to pump you up.  It's functional; it serves a purpose.  It may not be the kind of music you otherwise like to listen to.  No one should ever judge you for what's on your workout playlist.  If Kylie Minogue gets you moving, fuck the haters.  Fuck those couch-sitting, shitty-reality-show-watching, no-accomplishment-having, Cheetoh-eating haters right in their stupid faces.

* There is a fraternity of runners.  I know our hobby is a solitary one, and we like it that way.  But when you spot someone on the road, don't be afraid to take a second to think about what this person has gone through, what they are trying to accomplish, and what brought them to running.  At the very least the ""runner's nod,"" or a wave, a smile, or maybe even a generic word of encouragement.  I've been running through my neighborhood for a few months now and I know for sure that I've inspired a few people to get moving.  It's awesome to be able to show them that they make me feel the same way.

* You will go through a lot, mentally, on this journey.  The mentality you need to go from a sedentary lifestyle to running a 5k might be very different from anything else you've known.  (Let's be honest: if you knew how to make that shift, you would have already been running 5k.)  It will be very hard to explain it to others who have not done something like this.  Take the time to connect with other runners, even if just here on Reddit.

So now the time comes to actually start looking into 5K runs.  I'm not planning on doing anything fancy - no mud runs or trail runs or anything like that to start with.  Just show up, finish, and come home with a new t-shirt.  I will be looking for events in SE Michigan, if anyone has any leads or tips to send me via PM.  In the meantime, I am going to run Week 9 over and over again every week until I have an event.  If I see you out there, nod back.  :)"	t5_2rgoq	True

He is training for a 21k at the moment but wanted to drive out to a national park for a small run.

Today I planned to do W5D2 but the 8r, 3w, 8r seemed a bit to easy, especially before W5D3. Because I didn't want to keep him down with my walking I decided to skip day 2 and go for 20 minutes straight.

I expected the run to be incredibly hard, my friends runs 5:30 per km on average and the forest we ran through had some of the most ridiculous hills, but it was nice to see some nature instead of my usual route with loads of concrete and factories. I told my friend to just keep a steady tempo he preffered and I would follow him.

My goal was 20 minutes, but I wanted to try more if I managed to today. I instructed him not to tell me the distance (he checks his phone for distance regularry) unless I specificly asked for how long we had been running for my 20 minute goal.

I lost track of time as I didn't check my phone, but after a massive hill I was really hoping that the 20 minute mark would come soon, but when I asked my friend for the distance and time he told me I only needed 1.2 km more for a 5k. This achievement gave me such a boost that a did the last 1.2km relativly easy and when I stopped at the 5km I felt so incredibly amazing. I ran my first 5k in a few seconds over the 30 minutes!

And the best thing was that I didn't even feel like I had to stop. After a few minutes cooldown I felt great and my legs still feel great. This comes from the guy who did W1D1 on the 8th of January this year and almost puked during my 1 minute intervals because I barely could finish them.

C25K really works! Some people might have to repeat a few workouts, for others it might be too easy, but with dedication you will achieve your goals.

The only question is now, do I proceed with W6 or should I just keep running 5k's as a training for my first 5k race in March...

Thanks guys, without you I wouldn't be able to do this! Keep on running!

After taking a loss in W9D1, I shrugged it off, faced W9D2, and this morning I said ""Tonight...I'm doing it...I'm running 5k"".

And I did JUST THAT.

I set out on the ol' trusty treadmill that has been by my side since the beginning, set the incline to my familiar 1.5 and speed at 8.0 kph, and off I went.

It seemed like it was the longest run ever...which, technically, for me it was.  I didn't set my eyes on the clock at all but instead checked in periodically on my distance.  Every time I looked I neared closer and closer and got more and more adrenaline to keep me going.

As I neared the 5k mark I gave a final burst at an 8.5 speed, and with that I conquered the C25k program.

I'm so proud of myself for getting to this point.  I remember how I felt every time I reached a new milestone and thought how great it would be to finally make it to the end.  Well, 9 weeks later, I made it, and it was worth every effort and minute spent.  C25k worked like a perfect charm for someone who could barely even make it a minute without his heart feeling like it was beating out of his chest.

I'm going to continue working on the 5k and working on my pace, and then possibly make the jump to the B210k program.  Alternatively I may start the C25k program over again and utilize it as an even stronger interval training program.

Whichever way I go, I feel like I can only go up, and I'll continue to go up.  *queue the cliche line*  This isn't the end for me, but only the beginning.

So I dressed up in my finest running gear - a pair of cross-country skiing pants, a downhill biking jersey, gloves and an acid green hat, and went on my run, but not without worrying about what people were gonna think about me - were they gonna mock, laugh and point - after all, I looked like a bit of a tool.

But no, no one pointed at me, no one laughed, no one mocked. I met their eyes bravely, and I saw equal parts shame and admiration. I was out there running, they were mostly out smoking.

I'm pretty ecstatic and have definitely felt 'runner's high' on more than a few occasions. Yes, there were times when I just felt like not running, yes there were times when I had to *really* force myself to run but you guys have totally helped motivate me! 

And I also just want to pass on a few thoughts to help you guys that might be slugging it out at the halfway point or have just started your first week...get the fuck off the couch and run, you have no idea how lucky you are that you still have this ability and you can still achieve great things. I know it's never a good idea to compare your running to others but think of all the people that have suffered illnesses or have just gotten to old to do any of what it takes you to do in 30 or so minutes. Not everybody can do it, therefore running is a privilege, treat it as such. 

Also, more often than not when your running and you feel like giving up, focus on your form and you might just find that your legs aren't tired, your mind is. Do not stop. 

Asides from that, good luck everyone! I'm off to run my final run!!! "	t5_2rgoq	True

1) my heart rate isn't maxing out anymore, and is lowering quickly on walks. In 4 weeks, my average heart rate went from the 170's to the low 160's! Yay!  

2) I got lost in thought while I was running and listening to my music. I ""came to"" a few minutes later, so to speak, and realized that I was still running. STILL RUNNING! And not obsessing over how tired I felt, how much my legs hurt, etc.

1372515505.0	1hb71q	Checking in 3 months later	superherogrrl	72	5	13	"Hey guys, I know when I was working through the program I used to love these posts so I'm hoping that this will help encourage some of you who are just starting out, or coming up to the dreaded W5D3, or just finishing and wondering what's next.

I started C25K almost exactly 3 months ago, on 3/28. The first day I had to skip 2 of the running intervals and though I might die before the program was over for the day. My legs and my chest were killing me and I thought there was NO WAY I would ever be able to finish a 5k. Well, obviously I pushed through - some days were easier than others, and some were A LOT harder, but bottom line is, I finished. 

That's not even the best part though: I fell in love with running. It has now become my go-to exercise and I run at least 3 days a week and at least 3 miles each run. I am registered for the Rock N Roll Half Marathon in November, and am working my way through a modified Hal Higdon training plan to get to that point. Today, I completed a 7 mile run. 

When I looked at my runkeeper app this morning to log my run, I couldn't believe that it's only been 3 months since I started this program and I've come so far. It seemed like the 8 weeks of the program were going to take forever and some days seemed impossible, but I promise you - whether you're just getting started or are pushing your way through some hard days in the middle, it's going to be worth it.

Picking up running was the best decision I've made in my life, and even some days when my legs are screaming or my allergies are making my chest heavy, I just look at the road ahead and behind and think ""Look how far you've come already, you've totally got this"".

Thank you to everyone in this sub for all of the support, encouragement, and motivational posts because I seriously couldn't have done any of this without you guys.

I didn't get that these past ten weeks. Don't bother looking for my posts because I've since deleted them, but just know that it was very discouraging -- especially when I had no one else to lean on. 

If it's a stupid question, answer it anyway. If you don't know the answer, don't post a snarky reply.

The last 4 min were tough, but I did it!!! I am still in shock! This is the longest I have ever run in my life!

Thinking back on this program, I could barely run a minute in the beginning. W2d2 I felt like I was going to die and shit myself, and I contemplated giving up. I can't believe that was only a few weeks ago, and now I AM A RUNNER! 

So now that I have completed the timed version of c25k, I am going to work on my speed and distance. I was about 5 min short of completing a full 5k lastnight, but I think by next week I will be able to accomplish it.

1363188100.0	1a7vyh	I've always hated running, so now I'm making it my bitch.  3 weeks in the bag.	Darthbeer	73	11	13	"The idea that someone would run voluntarily has always eluded me.  Why, if you're not being chased, would someone do such a thing?

I've always been content being the jolly fat man, shoving food and beverage down my gullet with little thought of any long term consequences.  Starting to have to take blood pressure meds at 33 years old only briefly gave me pause.  My routine of walking every day quickly gave way to a return to my sedentary lifestyle.

Back in January, I had a routine checkup at the doctors, and found myself tipping the scales at an all time high for me of 293 (I'm 6'1"").  After my doctor scolded me to get active again, I started back in with my walking routine.

I would get up early before work (something else I'd never thought I'd do), and walk every day during the week.  I found myself thinking one morning ""I should just start running, I'm walking fast enough, it would be so easy to just start jogging.""  Chalking it up to temporary insanity caused by lack of caffeine and the early hour, I kept walking.

Well, the temporary insanity became less and less temporary, and I ended up getting a C25K app on my phone.  I just finished my third week, and I'm sticking this thing out.

I still dont like running, I hate it, but I'm out there punching the running demons in the junk 3 times a week.  And now I think if somone was chasing me, I'd actually have a chance of getting away!

I am not athletic at all, and pretty much play video games all day (and read books or at least read about those books a lot).

I honestly thought that I have this under control. I have my body under control and I can pick up and build it whenever I have the desire to do so. I can do push ups when I want, pull-ups too.

So, I decided, ""Hey, I think I should do C25K because it will help me give a good start to the fitness plan I have for myself"". I'll do C25K, and if I feel good after it I'll do 10k and then move on to muscular fitness and everything would be fine.

But I tried W1D1 today. It was a super hot day in the country where I live, 43 degree Celsius was the max temp. Probably not a good idea to start with and I wanted to do it barefoot. (I might be flat footed so I thought, hey this might be tough but what the hell...)

Being the retard I am, I decided to do it first inside my house, marble/tiled floor. So, I started up the podcast (thanks for that BTW) and off I was. Everything was fine, sure I was feeling a little out of breath, but that is to be expected, right?

At the halfway mark, I was like... aww yeah, easy peasy. But after two more one minute runs, I donno what suddenly happened, I was completely out of breath and was coughing and was about to fall down, when I decided to give up. I failed.

Yes, I have an ego. (No, I am not a drop out.)

I thought I had this all planned. I am 20 years old and I failed W1D1. I failed. I failed. **I failed.** FUCK!

I do not know where I am going with this post. I guess it is a rant or whatever the fuck. But, I now know what I have done wrong. All those missed sport classes, shit... now it comes into picture. I cannot wait till day after tomorrow, where I will attempt this again. Fucking I am counting down till the time comes when I can attempt again.

I WILL DO THIS. THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THIS PROGRAM. 

Not only did it show me how weak I am physically but it woke me up from my fucking fantasy land where I am the fucking king all the fucking time.

I never repeated a day, but I had a vacation, a cold, and a back injury that spread the first 5 weeks out to 7. It has been a struggle, but /r/C25K and the phone app has been keeping me going!  It has truly been amazingly helpful and motivational.  It is easy to go out for a walk, and turn the app on for the 5 minute warm up.  Regardless of how I felt before walking, I was always ready to run by the time that warm up was complete.

I hit a huge milestone today!  I ran for 20 minutes straight for the first time in my life, also completing a full mile run for the first time ever.  It is a pretty big deal for this overweight 28-year-old.  I am very proud of myself.  

The run started out pretty normal.  After 5 minutes I started to get crampy, so I adjusted my pace and slowed a bit to let it pass.  Next thing I knew she was telling me I was halfway there!  I cycled through a few songs to get something a little more up-tempo.  At 14 minutes, I was ready to call it, but I pushed myself to keep going and after 18 minutes I was well into my second (or third [or fourth]) wind.  I almost could not believe it when she called cool down.

Special thanks to everyone here. I couldn't (and wouldn't) have done it without you!  The motivational posts, personal victories, and stories of wins, defeats, and everything in between have been incredibly inspirational.

I misunderstood the directions and thought I needed to repeat the steps 3 times instead of 2.

At the end, I was worried I under-ran. I thought, ""I feel way under-worked, and am barely overheated, and not at all out of breath. I think I misunderstood the directions. I'll check the computer to see what I should have ran after my stretches.""

This community has been so instrumental in getting me off my lazy ass and on the pavement. I am so motivated to continue running 3x weekly and my goal is to be running sub-30 5k's three times every week. 

So now, my advice to people who are just starting:

* Go SLOW, even if you feel like you're not getting anywhere. Your pace will increase, I promise. 
* Don't overdo it. You do not need to run every day. Let your body rest. 
* Don't give up if you have a bad day. I had to run on a treadmill for one of my W3 runs (business trip in a slightly dangerous city),  and it SUCKED. I barely made it through. But hey, I made it through! 
* If you have an injury, please let it heal. It's okay to take a break in the program. You're not giving up by taking a break, you're respecting your body and giving it time to catch up to where you are mentally. 

And now, for some epiphanies:

* Holy shit, I actually like running. 
* I can run in the cold now and not feel like my lungs are going to burst into flame. 
* My ass looks awesome and I'm happy. 

Good luck! You CAN do this.

1360802989.0	18hcsk	"My turn to shout ""DONE!"""	spotster	74	12	14	"Because it helped reading other similar posts when I began, here goes my story.

I'm older than average, from what I've seen here, 37, male. I've never been very fit before, overweight nearly all my life, but things were getting worse for quite a few years now. So I decided to do something about it. I'm not quite sure how I found out about C25K, somewhere online, I guess, but I'd read about it and it seemed like a good idea, so late last October I began. Took me a bit longer than usual, repeated some runs several times but all in all it went better than I expected. My resting heart rate is better, blood pressure is down a bit and I'm down a pant size with minimal diet changes.

My tips for all you newcomers:

-Slow down. Seriously, take it slow.

-Buy new wick-away t-shirts. Even the cheap ones work wonders.

-The sweat. It doesn't stop, it gets slightly better, but the thing is you get used to it and it's actually cool when you're sweating because you've just ran 5 freaking k for the first time in 37 years!

-Motivation is key. Share your progress with your SO or with a friend or with /r/C25K, set up a calendar and cross off days, whatever works for you. 

-Stick with the plan, but don't obsess over it. Repeating a day, a week, is not the end of the world and should not be an excuse to quit.

And I'll stop now, I'll lurk around for a while longer and try to help out a few others before I drift away, but before I do I just wanted to say **THANK YOU /r/C25K**!!!"	t5_2rgoq	True

1374180688.0	1il31r	Running with less weight makes a huge difference. My experience with C25K	C_Linnaeus	68	6	15	"So I did and completed the C25K program last fall, it was crazy empowering to see that I could push my body to be able to run for 40 minutes straight, granted at a pretty slow pace. I didn't regulate my eating and did not lose a single pound, and I was about 30 pounds overweight.

After that I felt really empowered and motivated, and felt like I could really tackle weight loss. So after a fair amount of research, I stopped running and started counting calories and occasionally doing some strength training. I did this and lost about 20 pounds over 4-5 months. Then I started wanting to exercise more - bicycling and yoga, mainly. All of a sudden I reached this point where I DIDN'T feel like vomiting after every work out - I actually felt better. Who knew?!?

I decided, now that I'm pretty close to my target weight, to return to c25K, and have jumped straight into week 4 with no problems. Amazingly enough, my natural tempo is faster (all my old running playlists are too slow of a pace), and my pace is what it was when I left off, although obviously my endurance will need to be worked on.

TLDR; Extra baggage makes a huge difference. Running with 30 less pounds is way easier, and having endurance training from other activities helps too. IE. if you don't have any endurance training and are overweight, don't beat yourself up if your pace is real slow and feel like shit afterwards.

I am sure that there's not really a right or wrong way to do it, but I don't want to miss out on something that I'm not thinking about and like with most things, if a bunch of people are telling you there's a better way to do something, they're usually saying that for a reason."	t5_2rgoq	True

My pace wasn't too bad (7.03min/km) and the next few weeks I'll try and improve it a bit. But I'm just so proud of myself for doing it. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 5 years ago when I was 24 I was told I had arthritis in my hip (from an accident), turns  out they were wrong. I moved cities last year and went to a knew doctor to discuss my hip, he couldn't believe I actually had arthritis so he got me booked in for an x-ray and got me to monitor when I feel the pain and where. The x-ray showed no arthritis and apparently I wasn't feeling the pain in the right place in my hip, so off to the physio I was sent. Luckily for me I had returned to university and got in to be seen at the University's physio school. A lecturer and 3 students worked me over and found a muscle in my lower back was actually pushing down on a nerve that lead to my hip causing the pain. 4 weeks of physio and the problem was all fixed. 

For the last 5 years I'd used my hip as an excuse to not do as much exercise as I should, so I was really unfit when I started this. So I decided to do this plan and it was a great decision.

I'm looking at doing the Bridge to 10k next and possibly look at signing up for a 10k race in March. I live in a pretty small country and 5k races are pretty few and far between.

Here is some side notes as to why I am excited: Today was pouring the rain and I had only gotten a handful of hours in the sleep department. Every part of me wanted to just lay down when I got home, but I made myself step into my closet and get my shorts on, then my hoodie, then track jacket. 

I stepped outside and started my app and my tunes and just went with it. It was hard...really hard, but i did it. I finally caught on and payed attention to how I was breathing and slooooooooooooooowed down. Im sure my jog was slow as a turtle, but I was actually doing it. I remember hearing the app tell me that I was halfway there, and even with my lumbering, fat body swaying and my legs on fire, I knew I could do it.

1350409243.0	11kw2t	Ran for 30 minutes! Personal milestone!	on_my_mind_grapes	67	9	4	"I don't know how many miles it was (I was running on an indoor track, and I guess the GPS on my phone app is less sensitive in such a confined space...so it doesn't work properly) but I'm going to guess it was around 2.5 of just jogging. Once I got to W5D3 (last Wednesday 10/10) and was able to jog 2 miles, I let go of C25K and decided to get to 3 miles on my own. I'm hoping to get to 3 miles by next week. 

I felt a little discouraged after I did the initial two miles last week, because I was (stupidly) not giving myself breaks between runs, and found myself getting tired early on. Lessons I've learned throughout this journey: HYDRATE, eat a few hours before a run (or figure out what works for you and then do that), HYDRATE, get enough sleep, don't even think about giving up until after the first mile because after mile one you're too far in to quit, HYDRATE, accept encouragement from friends, tell as many people as you can that you're trying to start running/getting into shape (even if it's a little embarrassing) so you feel like you have a support system and you can't give up, HYDRATE, put good music on your iPod (or whatever you use), wear proper clothes/shoes, and remember that once you have the physical capacity to run a few miles, the rest of the challenge is a mental battle with yourself.

I wanted to turn around and go back home but my dog was in the back seat looking so excited so I decided why not just do it and see what happens. 

I cruised through it. 1 mile in my Nike app says I'm going at a 14:17 pace when normally it says I'm closer to 15:30. I realize I'm going to burn out so I attempt to slow down. My run ends right at 2 miles and it says my pace-- 13:38/mi. I cut nearly 2 minutes off my average pace on a night I was willing to quit on.

But  barring some form of injury or genetic defect, we have all evolved to be [runners.](http://discovermagazine.com/2006/may/tramps-like-us)

People run for different reasons with different motivations.  The idea that humans have evolved to be endurance runners is one of the things I like to think about when my scumbag brain is telling me to pull up short because I'm uncomfortable or hot or sore or just plain tired.  

I think that many of us, especially those of us who have been out of shape for a long time, sell our bodies short in what they can endure.

I'm still working with my cardiologist and neurologist for long-term treatment, but luckily my symptoms have, for the most part, subsided.

I set out this morning to do W8D1 and as time wound down, I realized how close I was to finishing.

So when my app told me if was time for the cool, down, I scoffed and imagined she was all ""what?  How can you possibly continue?""  I continued to run until I had completed the 5k.  In about 33 minutes!  Which I think is an okay time for my first time.

Now that I'm done, just some thoughts I'd like to share:

-YOU CAN DO IT.  As cliche as it is, if I can run 3.1 miles, ANYONE CAN.

-The benefits are astounding.  Running jump-started my stagnant weight loss.  I had been dieting since February and had only lost 10 lbs or so before I began the program.  I've now lost a total of 33 lbs.
I'm beginning to have a body that I love.  It's great!

-In April, my wife and I separated.  Divorce is a pretty weird thing; one in which you can begin to lose your sense of identity after sorting though your belongings and your life to pick out the things that are ""yours.""  And even those things are tinged with your ex.  *But running was something that was just mine.*  I began after she left, and I finished, all on my own.  It became something that made me look forward to getting up in the morning, something that helped me prove to myself my own self-worth.  And it was just mine.

-I only managed to splurge on gear for myself once.  I bought some [running socks from Target](http://www.target.com/p/c9-by-champion-men-s-6-pk-banded-low-cut-socks-brown-velvet/-/A-12234054#?lnk=sc_qi_detailbutton) that have absolutely blown me away.  I love them.  I recommend them.  Now that I've finished, I'll be rewarding myself with REAL running shoes.  At a running store.  Can't wait.

-My toughest day was W6D1.  The high from finishing W5D3 blew up my confidence too much and I was overwhelmed.

-Finally, I'd like to pretend like I just received an Academy Award and give out some thanks.

I visited my Dad for a few days. He used to run a lot, ran 3 marathons, but after an injury in the hip he sadly can't run like that anymore.

We decided to go for a run and picked a route that was 6km and finished at the house.

Because we were distracted by talking and looking at the beautiful scenery (South-Germany), we were back at the house in no time. What felt like a huge achievement a few weeks ago, just happened like that yesterday. 

It was the first time in my life that I went for a run and it seemed rather relaxing than challenging. It was driven by fun, instead of a thirst for results.

Truly amazing and definitely something to look forward to. I hope this can help you to finish your c25k and motivate you to keep running after that.

About 2 minutes in the doubt already started creeping in.  My nose was a bit clogged so it felt like I was already laboring.  But I pushed through.  I had a podcast on of a local morning radio show.  I figured if I listened to music I'd try to count how much time has passed by estimating song time.  So senseless humor would be a good distraction.

It worked.  The next thing I new I got a notification that I was half-way through the run and I was feeling pretty good.  I slowed my pace just a bit so I wouldn't run out of gas.  

Curiosity caught the best of me so I snuck at glance at my phone and saw I only had about 25 seconds left.  Holy crap I thought.  I did it!  Then I was done and I thought I could keep going...for about 5 seconds!  I was dead.  So I walked home during the cool down and sat on my porch to relax.

My head was pouring sweat like a faucet.  My arms and legs were glistening with sweat.  It looked like someone oiled me up or something.  I stood up after a few minutes and there was a sweat outline of my ass on the porch.

1373397472.0	1hyck3	You can probably run way further than you think	HansardBlues	63	5	15	"I have been running for two years. Started out not being able to finish a 2.5km, and now run distances up to 22km nonstop. The road from 2-22km is much, much shorter than you realize. For me it was about 5 months. If I had been more focused, i could have done it in 4. A few things I have learned along the way:

a) Your route really, really matters, especially when you are starting out. You want somewhere that doesn't require you to stop for traffic, is flat, is even and doesn't have a bunch of other joggers running super fast, making you feel like a slow loser (don't worry, you will be passing them soon enough). Seawalls, park trails etc. are the best for this. The idea is to remove unnecessary discomforts (social, spacial, and otherwise) when you are running.

b) If you aren't advancing your mileage fast enough, try to do your run at what feels like half speed. Slow right the fuck down, extend your KMs, and don't pay attention to your pacing, It will feel like you are barely moving faster than walking, but you are probably only going a 10-20secs/km slower than you were before. Keep slowing it down until you are hitting the distance you want to be hitting. Probably the biggest beginner problem I see is people running way too fast, and blowing their energy by the 1.5-3km mark.

c) Your diet is the biggest factor holding you back. Stop consuming rice, pasta, cereal, refined sugars etc. Read something like the 4 hour body, and stick to a good, modern diet.  You do not need to carbo load for anything below a 12-15km run. Your body has plenty of glucose available for you to draw upon for instense physical activity. A 5km run is not an excuse to go eat a plate of pasta and bread sticks.

d) Trying ditching your running partner. Running is a personal thing, and the chances that you and your running pal are at the exact same fitness levels are extremely slim. It can be useful to have someone to push you once every few weeks, but chances are, they are screwing up your pacing.  If they are running too fast, they are preventing you from going further. If they are running too slow, they are preventing you from increasing your cardio capacity. Find the time, place and speed that works for you.

e) A lot of people will tell you otherwise, but DON'T STRETCH BEFORE RUNNING. Warm your muscles up by running really slow for a few minutes before you start your real run. Stretch AFTER your run to prevent your muscles from being too sore after. Unlike baseball or hockey, running is the most natural of human activities -- you were built to run. 

f) The distance limitations are usually in your head. Whenever I have had a breakthrough in distance, it because my mind wandered, and I stopped thinking about my breathing and sore muscles. This is why good music, or talk radio is key to your run. Distract your brain, and you will run further, and faster than you ever imagined possible.

Hereâs the visual aid I used to track progress: [Yeah!](http://imgur.com/tSFhE)

I have always been overweight/obese and I donât think I was able to run a mile when I was in school without walking at some point.

At the beginning of March I was 272 lbs/123 kg.  I spent that month doing a lot of walking 6 days a week (W1-2: 2 miles, W3: 3 miles, W4: 4 miles) and started the C25K program on April 2nd.

I used the RunDouble Android app.  I wasnât able to do a full 5k on Thursday (my W9D3) so I changed the app to distance-based and ran it in 38:44 this morning. I am obviously not a speed demon but hey, I did it.

I didn't take 2 days off in a row and I have been doing the 100 push ups &amp; 200 sit ups programs on my off days.  My progress with those is slow but I get a little better each time.  

I think I will continue to run a 5k every other day for a month and see what improvements I can make on my time.  After that I'll keep doing what I'm doing or possibly start Bridge to 10K.

I am also 77 days free from cigarettes (13 year habit)!

Itâs been said before but I will say it again: **If I can do itâanyone can do it!**

Once I hit 28 minutes of running, I just decided to run at least that amount. I'm not concerned with how far I run, or how fast, I'm just doing it for fitness. so I technically didn't finish, but it got me running!

I've never run before this, and it was tough at first. I only did 4 out of the 8 1-minutes runs the first night. In the past, before getting pregnant with baby #3, I'd been working out to Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred with my husband. I'd done it for about 4 or 5 months before I quit. I'd always had a rough time with shin splints and sore knees, never being able to do the lunges, and the cardio part would kill me. I did get strong, but never felt great about the lower body.

Well, two nights ago, my husband and I decided to start up again.  It's been over 2 years.  I went thru it like it was nothing! No shin splints, no sore knees, no getting out of breath.  I kept up with the ""advanced"" girl, where before I'd stick with the ""modified"". Afterwards, I felt like I'd barely done anything!  I am so stoked! I am totally amazed at how fit my body has become since running and how amazing it's made my lower body. Looking at my legs, I notice no difference, but my endurance and stamina are crazy! I plan on trying running tonight, followed by the 30 Day Shred program a bit later after the kids are in bed. I can't wait to see how that goes.

9 weeks later and I can't believe I've reached the end of the flair list. What a great programme this has been. I never thought I'd be able to easily run 5k in just over 2 months.

Here are a few tips I copied from c25k redditor graduates that might be prove helpful for those of you that are thinking of starting or have just started.

1) **NHS Podcasts:** The first 4-5 weeks I found the [NHS Podcasts](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/couch-5K-running-plan.aspx) to be really helpful. These podcasts allowed me to focus on my running and didn't get me stuck keeping track of my time and distance. Especially during the first three weeks this proved to be a great thing. Laura - the podcast's host - did an excellent job keeping me motivated and her music selection wasn't half that bad (it got old after week 4). Once I hit week 5, when interval running ends and you start running 20min straight, I switched to playlists and good 'ol NPR programmes like 'This American Life', etc. This made those longer runs go by in no time and helped me run beyond the 30min in week 9.

2) **Visual C25K Plan:** I printed out [c25k visual plan](http://tombenninger.com/files/2011/09/VisualC25K.v1_0b.png) and hung it up in my office. I could check off a day whenever I completed a run and it got a few of my colleagues at work interested.

3) **Runkeeper:** Another fun thing that kept me going - *Runkeeper* - a free iOS app that tracked distance, pace and GPS of each run. Audio cues helped me keep my pace and it's fun to share your runs with a street team (other runners that are doing the programme).

4) **Sharing:** I was a bit sceptical about this, but sharing my Runkeeper runs on Facebook turned out to be a great idea. First of all it committed me to the programme and made me double-think before dropping a run day. The most surprising result has been that 4 of my friends have decided to take up running again and started using Runkeeper after I started posting my runs. We're all street team members now and share our running experiences with one another all the time. The words of encouragement from friends and family on FB also helped me a lot.

5) **The c25k Subreddit forums**: Updating my flair and checking the forum was the most rewarding for me. Reading all the progress reports, the set-backs, the break-throughs gave me a real sense that I wasn't completely 'forever alone' in the c25k world. 

To all of you noob runners like me - stick to it! It really pays off. I feel 10 years younger and have lost about 5lbs without making huge cutbacks on my food intake. All in all it's been the only fitness programme that has worked this well for me. I'm officially off the couch!

So once again - THANK YOU REDDIT! I can't wait to get started on 'Bridge to 10k'. I'll be running my first official 10k race in 4 weeks. Will check in on this forum from time to time. Until then - happy running Reddit!

My advice for others:

1. Watch your pace. When I started, I was simply running too fast for my endurance level. Slow it down, get the time endurance down, and then you can build up speed again.

2. Use Audacity to splice a C25K podcast music mix (electronic music + beeps to tell you when to change intervals) with an audiobook of your choice. Put the music in one channel, the audiobook on the other. The music will help you keep your pace steady and your energy up, and the audiobook will keep you mind occupied."	t5_2rgoq	True

I was actually talking to his girlfriend (a classmate) through Whatsapp and he just replied to my message on his own. I sort of think he meant it as ""a joke"", not an actual aggressive comment...but damn, it hurt.

But you know what? Fuck him. And fuck everybody who gets in your way. You're changing your life and some people might make fun of it. **Just remember, as long as you know you've improved, and continue to do so, you're cool.**

My family made a few jokes when I started running. They wouldn't believe me, would tell me ""Good luck with your walking"", or just question my decision to go out and run. People might make bad comments on how silly Week 1 and 2 look to them. How idiotic you are for ""barely running 5 minutes"". And when you get all over that, and get to W5D3 or onwards, when you've grown so much and made such a huge effort to get there, you'll still meet people who can do way more than you and will laugh at you.

So fuck them. This is my advice to everybody. Use the cruel jokes to your advantage. Today I had my wisdom teeth removed, so I don't plan to do any physical exercise for a few days. But as soon as I'm able to, I'll be remembering ""You're a failure"", and be using it as a source of strength.

Yesterday, my husband and I completed week 7 day 3 (yay us!). We have been running in circles around a little pond within walking distance of our house, but we decided to switch it up and run around the neighborhood. Giant Freaking Hill. Ok, so not giant, just one of those that go under an underpass and then back up to become an overpass. If that makes sense. It was very hard, I was shuffling along, still jogging, but barely. A lady, a very tiny one, was out running in the same area, and was cheering on a friend/stranger or was fast walking up the hill, and struggling. She probably ran up and down that hill 5 times, just cheering on everyone else who happened to run up that hill. When I was halfway, she yelled at me, ""Almost there, you got this!"" When I made it to the top, she high-fived me and said ""You made it!"" She truly seemed excited for me, more so than I was actually, I was thinking, ""Ok, my house is still so far away."" Haha. But, my point, she was so nice, and it felt good. Getting into running is hard, staying with it is hard, making yourself go outside on yucky days is hard, each run is a victory, so treat it like one.

Today, however, for a number of reasons, I couldn't even get past 2.5K.  It was very odd because I did w7d2 and felt great - no problem.

I had 3 beers last night, my nose was stuffed up (from pollution), and I didn't get enough sleep last night - those are all excuses, but it led to me having to stop at 2.5k.

I was pretty bummed since I had gotten this far mostly unfazed.  As I walked the remaining sessions time - ""the walk of shame"" I called it in my head - I started doubting if I am going to be able to do the race I have scheduled soon.  I have to now repeat a day and that's going to set me back.

Then it dawned on me.  I am sad that I *only* ran 2.5k.   I am bummed because I had a bad day running - not, ""I am bummed because I couldn't get off the couch"" or ""I just didn't feel like running today"".

I totally failed today, but something my friend used to say suddenly made sense:

""It's ok to try and fail, it's not ok to fail to try.""

And I suddenly had everything in perspective.

Hopefully this will help anyone else who gets / got discouraged from having to repeat a day or two.

1333916674.0	rzntd	This program is literally changing my life.	TheHiddenFox	63	8	7	"I just finished Week 2 Day 3, and I feel great. This program is so awesome I can't even begin to describe. 

I've struggled with depression for about 8 years now. 9 months ago, my best friend passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly. From there, things spiraled out of control. My depression completely took over; I didn't even leave my room for weeks at a time, have been failing all my classes, and wallowing in depression and self-pity constantly.

Then two weeks ago, I snapped. I got tired of hating myself and being depressed all the time. I wanted to hit the gym and burn off all this negative energy weighing me down. But I've always had this problem at the gym, where for YEARS I have bitched about hating cardio activity, because I finally work up the motivation to go to the gym, and I push myself too hard and then get mad at myself for not being able to run for 45 minutes straight at 7mph. And then the next day I'm too sore and pessimistic to go to the gym, and thus, I never go again.

I knew I had to start somewhere, so I checked out this subreddit and decided to give this a try, and I LOVE it. I feel so good. I can actually feel myself getting better and each day getting easier, and now, crazy enough, the *running* is my favorite part of each workout. I can't wait for the next day every time! I am so excited and confident and I feel like a superstar. I know that finishing Week 2 isn't exactly a huge feat, but I feel invincible. Between this and a new, very awesome counselor, for the first time since I lost my best friend, I feel like there isn't 16,000 tons of weight pulling me down into my hole of depression. I am so, so, so, so happy I gave this a try.

Sorry, I know it's long, but I had to rave to someone about how good I feel. I feel awesome! :D

I fought the good fight, but did have to throw in the towel just past the halfway mark, just couldn't keep running (however, I was a good half mile from home, so continued the brisk walk back, and kept moving the entire time)

The reason I feel like I succeeded?

This amount of running is HUGE for me (treadmills do not compare), and also, it's *really* hilly where I live, so no matter how hard I tried to work it so I was only walking uphill, I'd still get some sections where I had to jog uphill.

But anyways, 3.1 miles 36:02!  I Did it!

At first, I couldn't do a full minute without being in pain.  So if that is where you are today:  it is possible with hard work and dedication.

I started C25K about five months ago.  I did great for a while, and then week 5 day 3 hit.  I just could NEVER get that twenty minute run.  I made it a full mile a few times, but just didn't have the stamina and mental toughness to continue.

So I went off the guide and did full 5k 3 times a week just walking when I needed to and running when I could.

I took about four weeks off --- it got cold and I didn't want to run on the treadmill anymore so I focused on strength training and other forms of cardio-----and decided to tackle it again yesterday.

For anyone that it might help, here is what I learned through the process and in yesterday's run.

The first mile SUCKS!  That really is the hardest part.  Even top runners will tell you the mile is the toughest hurdle.  I have read somewhere a common complaint is ""I just got to a mile but I can't go any farther"" but everyone responds ""yes you can, if you can get a mile you can get two or three easy"".....and I finally learned that was true. 

Just gut it out for two more minutes, and then two more minutes, and eventually you will be up to that twenty minute mark....and for me, at that point, I was in a zone and just kept going.

Pacing:  It has been said 1000 times on here, but i'll say it again: go as slow as possible even if any slower they would call it walking.  Just pick a pace you can stick with for 30+ minutes.  Time will come, later ---- that's where I can proudly say I am today after months of trying.

Get outside and off the treadmill!  I tried running on the treadmill for months.  I heard it was easier than running outside.  Maybe that is true for some or most people, but it didn't turn out to be true for me.  It was a good place to start but after my first run outside, I realized I never wanted to run on a treadmill again.

Its easier to quit on a treadmill than it is outside.  You can just kinda stop whenever you feel like it and get off when on a treadmill.  Outside, if you run for ten minutes --- well you just committed to twenty because you have to turn around and get back somehow.  

And, choose an outside course that has a lot of twists and turns.  Its easier when you can break up your run in multiple short sections.  ""Ok, i'll just run to the end of this road....now just to the end of this road....now to where it bends"" and so on and so on.  Pretty soon you'll be far enough where you can say ""well I made it this far might as well finish it up.""

If you made it this far:  Thank You!  And some words of wisdom from Coach Bryant that got me this far.

2.) My time wasn't fast, but I finished. To me finishing was more then abut the time. 
3.) The hills, oh my god the hills. I was totally unprepared for them. I am moving to all outside running. I have muscle hurting I never knew I had.

I was having such a hard time making it through my run without him and I didn't know that I ever really wanted to run again to be honest. 

Everyone here had such kind words of hope and encouragement. I felt less alone and while I still didn't want to run, I felt less like shit for not running. 

Today my boyfriend and I found a puppy and I think we will be taking her home next week. 

And as I'm moving on with this part of my life I found my running shoes in the corner staring me down. 

So I laced them up. And I did it. It sucked. And it was sad and I was by myself and I knew he wouldn't be there when I got home but with each step I felt stronger and felt like I'm reclaiming myself. 

So I know this all sounds super melodramatic, but ... Thank you guys, do much. I wasn't running just for me, I was running so I wouldn't let down the community that encouraged me and the only people that really understood what I meant when I said I couldn't run.

I've been doing this program since last August.  Yes, that's right.  I've been doing it for about 10 months, and I'm on week 7.  I took months and months without touching it, I repeated days, I sometimes only ran once a week...

And I hated myself for that.  I hated that I couldn't just stick to the program.  What could be simpler than just run and walk when the lady tells you, three times a week?  I'd lose focus, get sidetracked, overwhelmed with school, and I'd stop.

But I always started again.  I always started.  And despite those months of interim, I'm proud today that- as I discovered today- I didn't lose all of my progress.

The other day I was walking my dog.  About 15 minutes in, she was panting a little too heavily, so I decided that she was probably too hot and I took her back home.  But I was still pumped from the brisk walk, and from 15 minutes of listening to my workout playlist.

So, I decided to try C25K again.  I didn't expect to get far at all.  I just started where I had stopped, and saw how far I could go.  It was W7D1- 25 minutes of running.  I made it about 13.5 minutes, walked for about 10, and ran another 5 or so minutes.

Words couldn't express my joy- and relief- that I hadn't lost that progress after about a two month break.  Not to mention the fact that I ran farther than I ever had- even when I was completely on track, I couldn't make it more than halfway through that day.  I decided to try, in the following days, to slowly whittle away at that 10 minute walk, a minute at a time.

Which brings us to today.  Got my sneakers on, smelly stinky sports bra, t-shirt, and water bottle.  I ran and ran.  Soon enough, I was halfway.  Then I was at the point that I had stopped two days ago.  I flew by it.  Pretty soon, I was chanting to myself, ""Okay, we'll stop at the stop sign... stop sign... stop sign.... Alright, then, the oak tree... oak tree... oak tree....... fine, that mailbox... mailbox... mailbox..."".  The landmarks kept flying past.  Well, alright, ""flying"" isn't the right word.  But I pushed my huffing puffing body right on by.

Then- bam- I look down at my iPod- five minutes left.  I'm thinking about the dread I felt in elementary school when we were made to see how fast we could run a mile.  Then in middle and high school when we had to run back and forth across the gym and see how long we lasted.  I start imagining my brother's face when I would tell him how far I ran, I decided which one of my friends I would choose to annoy with my bragging.  Pretty soon, in my mind, I was running a 5K, then a marathon, then in the Olympics.  Then, my music got quiet, and I heard the most beautiful words on planet Earth...

Running makes me feel like the king of the planet.  I LOVE IT!  I want to continue adding more time to my runs, and I would love an app that tellsme each time I hit 5 or 10 minute increments.  Know any good apps? (iPhone)

My weight loss journey started at ~320lb (145kg) pounds.  Right now I am under 250 lb(113kg), and my goal is around 200lb (90kg).  I'm about 6'1'' (1.85m).  Sorry, no pictures.  I might take some when I hit my goal weight.

Story Time!
A couple months ago I wanted to give running a chance.  I could do the stationary bike but it was getting boring.  One of my friends lost about 100 pounds in the last year, mostly through running and diet control.  He mentioned the C25K plan, and I tried it.  I bought some compression shorts, and ârunningâ socks.  I am so glad I did!

The first few weeks went OK.  I was getting winded, but I didn't know any better.  I would add time to intervals, and add additional intervals.  I had some failures in the first couple weeks. Poor hydration, eating too soon before running, etc.  Nothing major, just cramps that resulted in failed runs.  But thanks to you guys, and /r/loseit I learned so much about running.

I had a huge mental block getting to W5D3, like most people do.  Then one day I got on the treadmill planning to repeat the last day for the 3rd or 4th time, and I just said, âfuck itâ at the last second and decided to try W5D3.  I slowed down a bit, and I did 44 minutes.  After that I knew the rest of the plan would be easy sauce.

Right after I finished week 8 though, I hurt my knee.  The day after, I could not put any weight on it.  I rolled around in my office chair all day.  I was pissed, but all I had to do was take a couple extra days off, and I was fine.  I am glad I did not try to run through the pain, because I am sure I would have done some terrible damage to myself.

I never thought I would call myself a runner, and I never thought I would ENJOY running!  My reward for finishing this program is a proper pair of running shoes.  Asics Kayano 18.  I can't wait to break them in!

Once I hit my goal weight I'll post more details about my weight loss in /r/loseit, but for now I just thought I would share part of my story with you fantastic people.  I love you all.  Keep running.

But really, I'm not. I've completed my first training program, but I'm not *done* with running. This is my life now.

I started Late November 2011. January 13 2012, I can run 5.5 km in 30 minutes flat, and I've registered for my first 10k race on April 15th.

I'm planning to continue running 3x per week, adding .5k to each run every week. My goal is to get to 10k in 45-55 minutes.

I've lost weight in fat and put it back on in muscle. I still have a little flab here and there, but it's melting more and more by the day.

When I say 'total transformation' I mean a bit of my appearance, but mostly my diet, lifestyle and mindset. 

Before I started, I was utterly sedentary, eating ~2500 calories a day, had to squeeze into my clothes, my face broke out a lot, and I felt shitty and tired all the time. I suffered from depression and anxiety, and had severe self-esteem issues.

Now, I eat ~1200 calories a day and feel satisfied and full all the time, my clothes are too loose (even my 'skinny clothes'), my skin is radiant and clear most of the time, and I wake up with energy ready to burn.
I do Zumba on mondays, yoga on tuesdays, run on wednesday, friday and sunday, and do the Jillian Michaels Killer Buns &amp; Thighs dvd most thursdays. While my depression isn't ""cured"" (and never will be) the symptoms are essentially gone. I feel confident and proud of myself, and can talk myself out of a lot of my mental attempts at self-defeat.

Everything is different. I don't feel like I just completed a crash course in ""don't be a fatty 101"" and now I'm going to go back to my old life. I feel like an entirely new person, kind of like I just joined a church and got baptized, or just entered a new and exciting relationship - except all these changes depend on ME and me alone, and this concept I'm committing my life to has changed me in honest and lasting ways, unlike an external lifestyle change that depends on a commitment to others.

Forgive me for the wall of text, but I just had to share my excitement and I truly hope I can motivate others to get to this point too. I would be more than happy to answer any questions about my lifestyle changes or what to expect from the program.

* Trusting my body. If I can't do something, I don't. If I am doing something, I continue till I can't.
* Slowing down. I plod towards the end, but I do not walk. I still jog at a snail's pace. This is what I'm comfortable with
* Breathing. Breathing in through nose, breathing out through mouth. This is where I find my rhythm.
* It's ok to fail. And why do we fall Bruce?
* I've gone from huffing and puffing in a 2min jog to huffing and puffing after a 20min jog. To me this is success
* I've switched from music and NHS podcast to a very boring Audiobook. I've found that all I need is something to keep droning on and distract my thoughts
* Outdoors &gt; Treadmill, if only for the fact that a treadmill forces you to keep a certain pace unless you can program it right.
* Most importantly - r/C25K you guys fucking rock my world. Thank you. For your support, for sharing your success AND (more importantly) for sharing your failures. I doubt I'd have reached this far without you."	t5_2rgoq	True

I pushed through the first three runs, skipped the fourth one, and realized on the fifth one that continuing would be more harmful than helpful. My chest felt tight, my hip was hurting, and my thigh was tight from a slight strain on Sunday. I walked the rest of the way home, though since I aborted my app I'm not sure if I even walked the whole rest of the time.

Even though I technically failed, I am still proud of myself and optimistic of completing the program. True failure is doing nothing, so this was a success as far as I'm concerned.

Any time I would have bad days, I always came on here and felt better with all the encouragement and tips from fellow runners. I suffered from shin splints about 2 months straight- took a break (just 4 days) and bicycled about 30 miles and ta-da! No more shin splints! After that the running and distance just got easier. 

I may be slow, but dammit- I can run a 5K now, and I'm signed up for my first in December! Hopefully I can do it under 40 minutes, but I'm happy to just complete it. 

So just remember, if you have a bad running day (and everyone does) just remind yourself you are getting out there and RUNNING while others are just sitting on the sofa. It disturbs me to think that when I first started this program I could barely run 30 seconds straight and the thought of a 5K was daunting- now I'm ready to train for a half marathon.

1341114557.0	vv61v	First official 5k done tonight!!!! (Lengthy text, hopefully inspirational for those in the program)	mhensh01	55	2	17	"Tonight, I ran in my first 5k race. Yes, you read that correctly. I can hardly believe I just typed it out. In late March, I spent a week in the hospital with a couple of surgeries under my belt that are better not rehashed here. I thought I may share some of the reasons for why I decided to start the c25k, and some of the things I have learned along the way; maybe it can be considered inspiring, or perhaps it only serves as further evidence of what a lunatic I am.

I have looked at this kind of program in the past, but for a variety of reasons never thought it was for me. I was too overweight, the weather or terrain wasnât right. I had pockets full of excuses. Getting past March, I was determined to do something though about my health, and general state of fitness. I was satisfied with the results of some of my dietary changes, but knew I had to do more. The final straw was volunteering at a marathon at a hydration station. I was pretty miserable that morning, and felt the usual isolation that I feel most of the time here. My shift included the majority of the 5k runners, and I was surprised that many people who seemed in worse shape than I felt were chugging along, not lagging behind everyone. I went home that night, and reinvestigated the c25k. Coincidentally, my town was having a 5k race on the last day of June-9 weeks to train. I decided, Damn it, I am going to try this.

One thing that is always suggested is to consult a physician before starting a new physical fitness routine. I did not and I probably should have.
To re-iterate, consider that I was starting from a point where I have only done any significant walking/jogging when I was in a gym a couple years ago-doing 30 minutes on a treadmill at what I would call a âbriskâ walk, and the occasional death march/hike thing.  So this was a square 1 deal, I truly had NO running ability.

Day 1 was brutal. I was exhausted, and the troll mind kicked in with âYou canât do thisâ and âI quitâ. I could barely jog for 60 seconds at a time, and I felt every shape that I was out of. One of the unpleasant side effects of my poor diet/diabetes control has been the near-constant ache in my feet, and they felt like they were on fire after 30 minutes.

But I fought on, and by the end of the first week, I was not as horrible as the first day.

As the weeks went on, I struggled, but managed to keep up. My first ârepeatâ was in week 4-I physically could not do it. I thought about giving up again. Then, I broke my toe. And I lost my Mp3 player (fortunately I have a backup). This pushed me into the red, and the day I broke my toe, I went out and blew day one of week 4 out of the water. With a broken toe. Simply stunned was my feeling when I got back to my apartment.

I mostly did my runs in the evening. I did try the morning a couple of times, but felt kind of lousy the rest of the day. I also learned I had to eat something an hour or so before running-I tried running on empty, and that was where the cramping seemed to flare up. Morning runs evidently help kick your metabolism up, so I may transition to mornings over the summer.

The first time I ran for 25 minutes straight, I was beside myself. I just kept repeating âWhat.The.Fuckâ over and over as I slowed down. This was also when I really started beating the program. First I made up for the week I had to repeat, then I transcended another week entirely. Then another. By week 7, when I only was needing to run 25 minutes, I ran 30 minutes (which is the week 9 runs). Then I ran 40 minutes. Then 45. Now the last couple nights I have run the entire 3.1 miles in about 49 minutes. I had been running only for time, not necessarily for distance.


The day of the race.

I spent most of the day in the house, and got to the site about an hour before race time. We had a couple storms roll through in the afternoon, and it was humid, hot, and breezeless. Then the sun came out 10 minutes before the race time. At 6:55, it felt like 92 degrees out, and with no wind at all it was quite brutal, among the most brutal conditions I have trained in thus far. The pistol fired, Dr. John's ""Getaway"" started, and I was off. Although trailing far behind more seasoned runners, I kept my pace, only slowing down twice during the run to a walk for 2-3 minutes before going back up to a jog. At the first hydration station, I threw water on myself. This helped only marginally. But the distance added up, and as Jay-Z's ""Izzo (H.O.V.A)"" blasted in my headphones I could see the finish line. I kicked it into higher gear, and crossed the finish line at 45:38. I think. My mind was not quite registering what was happening. It might have been 46:38. My time will be posted online shortly. I was handed a cold bottle of water and a cold wet rag which I put on my head. I DID IT.


So what have I learned and what is next? Because it does not end with this 5k. My new goal is to either run another 5k this fall under 40 minutes, or a 10k if I can do the bridge to 10k workout over the next few months, and if a 10k is scheduled close by.

1.âDo What Thou Wilt Shall Be The Whole of The Lawâ-Crowley

If you really have the will to do something, no obstacle will keep you from it. Between the heat, injuries, and most of all the voice of âCanâtâ in my head, none of them stopped me. More telling, this was mostly done by my will, not someone else prescribing it.

2. âYour Anger Is A Giftâ-Rage Against The Machine

This song (""Freedom"") wasnât in my playlist, but should have been. My music was mostly either heavy metal, or rap. I realize now more than ever that I am a profoundly furious man, made worse since getting laid off a year and a half ago. Iâve struggled to find productive ways to express this for years though, especially having to keep it bottled up at work. I donât know if my anger comes across in conversation or when I write, but believe me it is right there on the back burner. Finally, running has given me a great way to express this feeling. More than just raging along with a metal song, and more than even going to a live metal show, every meter I run is viscerally pushing the negative energy through my muscles and feet. Itâs hard to explain in words. I am sure that I am an equally hilarious and frightening sight in the last few minutes of my runs as I yell at myself and use up all of my cussing for the day. Running alongside others will be an interesting experiment in restraint, and I hope no sensitive ears are anywhere close to me when I finish. Note: I bet I was barely intelligible, I was lucky to communicate with the guy who took my picture how to take my picture.


3. Battles will be lost, but the war can still be won

I am not proud of the times I had to repeat, and I certainly am not proud of my pace. But Iâve had to learn to be satisfied with my progress, and to consistently measure my accomplishments not against a nebulous ideal but against where I was at 61 days ago. Incidentally, it was my best time completed, and I am sure adrenaline had a lot to do with that.

4. You are only accountable to yourself, but no one exists in a vacuum.

I even hesitated telling anyone about this, since I knew failure was a possibility. In the end, there was only myself to blame for failing. Eventually, I think around the second week, I did start talking with my parents about doing this. I then shared it with my boss (who himself runs every morning before work), eventually several people at work knew and were cheering me on. A few others friends knew too and were super supportive. There was also the faceless yet ever-present support of reddit.com/r/c25k where I posted my progress and got encouragement and motivation from others who only know me as a handle.

1336153898.0	t75ma	I am close to the finish!!!  But...Its going to be a Couch to 30 minutes of continuous jogging completion, not Couch to 5K.  	meatp1e	57	3	23	"Probably the only reason I, who started as a severely sedentary and overweight individual, was able to stick with this program was the option to run for time and not for distance.  

I have not cheated once.  I have followed every step of the program.  I have successfully completed every day.  But, the fact of the matter is I am still carrying about 270 pounds on my 5'6"" male frame (FYI, started at 315.  I'm still working on it, believe you me).  What this means for me is that I've needed a relatively slow pace in order to complete the weekly intervals because when I increase my pace too much, it feels like my heart and lungs redline like a car stuck in 2nd gear.  

I have read plenty on /r/running and /r/c25k to know that a slow pace is just fine when a beginner.  And even after 8 weeks of C25K, I know i'm still a beginner to running.  And as my weight goes down and my body continues to adapt, increased speed will come.  

So here is my query for all of you.  I am currently at about 1.75 miles for 28 minute interval.  And believe me, I am ecstatic to be able to run this far without walking breaks.  I push myself a little every run, but the main importance is finishing the run, not burning out halfway through.  Heart rate wise, this is about as fast as I'm willing to safely go right now.  Which means my 30 minute pace will not be near a 5K distance.  So, after I finish week 9, should I just keep repeating week 9 until I get a 5k in 30 minutes, or should I keep my same turtle pace and try and increase my interval times?

Either way, I'm gonna keep jogging.  It took me 31 years of bad habits to get into this shape.  I don't expect a 9 week program to make it all go away.


Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions and encouragement everybody.  We'll see where I'm at in two weeks.  I think I'll probably do week 9 for a couple weeks, while keeping mindful of my cadence, breathing, running form, etc.  I imagine that will create a little extra efficiency as well.  "	t5_2rgoq	True

I thought about my moms battle with drug abuse all of her life and how HIV/AIDS killed her off at the young age of 48 back in 2008. I thought about the look on their faces when I was the first in our family's history to obtain a Bachelor's degree. None of this had anything to do with running, but I got caught up in a surge of emotion when I completed this run today, something that I had never done.

My aunts were so impressed with my dedication ([they do marathons](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/164417_10151290323997064_531613169_n.jpg)) that they took me to shoe dog to get my [feet/stride analyzed](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/374558_10200462570394145_1313768799_n.jpg) and bought me some [new stability running shoes](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/555112_10151284104362064_1994108771_n.jpg)!

I did 2.5 miles [the other day at sunset](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/462_10151292511017064_976260944_n.jpg) and it felt SO GOOD. I can't wait for this week. A few months ago, I would have laughed in your face if you told me I was going to do a 5K. 

[Here's me, **40lbs down**, about to do **30 minutes** and **smile** while doing it.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/48antyhrzgvijby/PhotoGrid_1362465000179.jpg)

Yesterday was my last day. I decided to do something special and went [running on the trail by the river](http://imgur.com/a/zvJJp#0). It was so fun and later, I realized I had done 3.3 miles. I'm 80 lbs overweight and did a 5K. If i can do it, SO CAN YOU!

This being the end of the first week of the new year, I figure I can't be the only one who has just finished (or is just about to finish) week one, and I want to share the joy and motivation.

This is my third time doing C25K (though I did finish the other two!) because I always get lazy and quit just after completion. I know what I'm in for and hope I don't lose steam this time, so I hope to get a little mutual encouragement from this subreddit too, which I didn't know about for the first two go-arounds.

I went off and on the program for awhile, but I've been with it for awhile now and I can say that I'm down 106 lbs and today I finished and ran 4.7 km! (I hope to be able to do 5k next week.. being over 300lbs in the past makes the knees achy so I take it slower than most) In the past month I have been upping my speed by leaps and bounds and have doubled my distance in the past two weeks!  I am so happy with myself.  At 335 lbs I needed help off of the couch and help putting on my socks, now I can just about run 5k!! Life is amazing!!

1351303456.0	125mk3	I did it...I was really wet and cold...but I did it.	pantiesinabunch	57	6	8	"I ran my first road race tonight.

It was a fun run through a cemetery.  It was pouring down rain and really cold.  I bagged the costume planned and opted for two coats, a hat, and gloves.  I had to peel a layer off about half way through.  I slipped on leaves twice during a particularly dark part of the course.

I was not prepared at all for the hills...not one bit.  I started off too fast, running the first 1.5 miles at a 10:30 pace and totally died once I hit those damn hills...I even had to walk a few fast minutes just to give my legs a break.

I finished in 36 minutes flat, 2 minutes off the mark from my goal, but its respectable for an asthmatic runner with a 30"" stride...and I know everyone says this, but if I can do it, so can you.

1318463572.0	la6mb	DONE! Some thoughts &amp; reflections.	skyscape	54	2	15	"This is the first time I've ever seriously attempted to become a runner, and I couldn't be happier with the results. At the beginning, I could barely run the 90 seconds -- I paused my app to allow for longer walking breaks and couldn't believe I would ever make it to the end, but here I am!

I've lost 10 lbs since beginning the program -- I'm a 5'5"" 22/F, started at 140 lbs and I'm sitting pretty at 130 now. More than the weight loss I've noticed that my legs are shaped differently; my whole body is tighter and looks more athletic.

I have never been able to even run a mile before starting C25K. I remember in middle school and high school we used to have to run ""the mile"" once a year for gym; I dreaded that day. Now I can do 3.23 miles in 30 minutes!

So here are my thoughts and reflections for all of you still plugging away:

* I started listening to audiobooks around week 7 of the program and it totally changed the game for me. It feels like you've got a running buddy with you (I'm listening to Bossypants by Tina Fey right now and I find myself laughing out loud at points) and it's just distracting enough. I used to listen to music, but the changing beats would mess with my breathing (at least mentally). Listening to an audiobook lets me listen to my breathing and monitor my pacing while keeping me distracted enough to not constantly wonder how much time I have left.
* DO NOT look at the clock. Just don't do it. It makes everything worse.
* If you feel like you can keep going past the time you're supposed to run, go for it, but don't over-exert yourself. My best days were when I ran an extra three or even five minutes at the end -- it made me feel invincible.
* Be careful what you eat before you run. I made the mistake of consuming bean dip an hour before a run during Week 6 -- never again.
* **Keep going.** When you want to stop, don't. You'll be shocked at what your body can do when your brain holds a hard line.
* You won't always want to run. Sometimes, your run sucks. But even when I didn't want to go, and even when my runs sucked, I was *always* happy that I'd done it once I was done. So just do it. It feels awesome.
* Reward yourself! Not with junk food (preferably), but share your success with your friends and family. It's okay to feel like a fucking terminator. You ARE a terminator. You're a fucking runner! Look at you!
* And finally -- don't be self-conscious. I used to be afraid to run outside where people could see me. I was afraid they'd judge me when I'd stop to walk, or that I looked funny when I ran. Fuck it; other people don't care and neither should you. Also, running outside is SO MUCH BETTER than a treadmill. It's interesting and you feel like a fucking natural woman (or man).

KEEP ON WITH YOUR BAD SELVES, R/C25K. And thanks for all the support. You're all the best."	t5_2rgoq	True
1314648438.0	jyac4	Recently finished C25K. I have 2 tips for the beginners.	fry36	55	7	17	"I started the program about 2 months ago, at a point where running for 20 seconds made me miserable and hate life. Now I'm able to run for ~30 minutes straight and feel like I can uppercut orcas. I know it's been said before, but if it's going to engrave it in your head, why the hell not: you could fucking do this. I know it gets tough. There are times you want to just stop early and take yourself to the nearest couch. Fuck those times. On that note, here are 2 things that really helped me with this program:

Don't look at the time! I know it's tempting to glance at how much longer you have to pant and sweat, but don't do it! Set a timer, guesstimate from the songs you've been listening to, but no matter what you do, don't count down the seconds! Once you finally hear that ""beep"" or realize you're almost done with an album and you have like 10 seconds left, you'll realize you didn't give your brain that chance to turn back on you with the overly dramatic bullshit. You won't think of stopping early if you don't look at the clock early.

Don't underestimate your gains! If you're a few weeks into the program, and you're in your last few minutes of the run, body begging for a rest, just remember that a few weeks ago, you could barely run for a minute straight. When you see that there are people out there quadrupling your longest runs without breaking a sweat, just remember...you're doing the same to your max week after week! There should be nothing stopping you from saying ""I'm doing fucking awesome.""

1366994831.0	1d5vp4	Thanks for the encouragement (from a long-time lurker)	Zeiei	57	7	6	"I want to use my first reddit post to thank the members of this group for their encouragement.  I am long-time lurker of this and other subreddits.  

A little more than a year ago, I started on Couch-to-5K.  Each day, I would come to this reddit and read what everyone was going through and, even though I never joined in the conversation, I gained much encouragement from this group.  

I found it to be motivational to come here and read your stories before I went out to complete whatever day of whatever week I was on.  It really helped to read posts from those who were weeks ahead of where I was so I was better prepared for what my body was going to complain about.

I originally started C25K because I realized my endurance wasn't what it should be during a martial arts class (I'm a higher-ranking student in this class and found myself getting out of breath far too easy...to the point of it being embarrassing).  After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that running was by the far the best way to improve endurance.  I had never ran before.  In high school gym class I walked most of the track when we had to ""run"" the mile.  I read about how successful people were with C25K so I went with it...after all, I could always quit if it wasn't for me.

The first day, I thought I was going to die.  I came back inside the house, laid down in the floor, and stayed there for half an hour trying to recover.  It was not pretty.  The second day was similar.  But it got better--it got better a lot faster than I would have thought, too.  By the start of the second week I was no longer hitting the floor at the end of the workout.  Day 3 of Week 5 was a big confidence booster.  By the time Week 7 rolled around, I had found that I enjoyed running (or at least the feeling you have after finishing a run...you know, where you've pushed your body to new limits and survived).

Anyway, I survived and those of you just starting will too.  It is amazing what your body is capable of doing.  On Week 1 Day 1, I could barely do the first 60 seconds.  Now that length of time barely scratches the surface.

I'll also add that when I started I was 266 pounds.  I've lost a good chunk of that and it has definitely improved the running experience.  So, even if you are overweight you can still do this--just pay close attention to what your body is telling you and take good care of those joints.

Again, thanks for the encouraging posts that helped me to discover pleasure in running."	t5_2rgoq	True

I'm feeling the best I've felt in years. 

To newcomers, this program will not fail you if you stick to it. I've pushed through horrible shin splints, wanting to give up, skipping a whole week because of a cold, and still I want to run. And let me just say that I am super astounded by this. I have never been a strong runner or exercise enthusiast. C25k, thank you. I have found an exercise I love and I feel so strong and able.

1351085996.0	1206c4	Oh Baby! Done =)	speechiegrl	59	7	11	"I cannot believe that I just ran my last day of C25K!! When I first started this program I honestly did not think I would be able to get through it. I ran on and off through college and then really fell out of it once I graduated. Picking up running again has really (and as corny as it sounds) really helped saved me. I went through a bad breakup around this past Christmas and needed to find something to distract me from it. I got back into running in March and then found C25K in May and didn't start it until the end of August. It took me around 11 weeks to run this but I finished it &amp; feel amazing. I picked running back up for me &amp; couldn't be more proud of myself for sticking with it &amp; amazed at the fact that I have watched my body change from not being able to run a mile straight to being able to run 2 miles straight without stopping. My 5k time is still not great but I know that's something I can continue to work on and improve. I want to do B210K but with the winter months coming up I think I want to wait and start that in the spring and focus now on improving my 5k time &amp; slowly increasing distance. 

To everyone just starting C25K or feel discouraged, you CAN do this! It is not impossible but it is not easy. I ran into multiple injuries throughout the program and my own motivational issues over the weeks but I didn't let them stop me. Monitor your pace and have a positive attitude &amp; you'll be changing your flair to DONE! 

I also want to thank everyone on this sub-reddit too that has given me advice and motivated me throughout all of this. This has been an amazing experience &amp; I can now say I consider myself a runner =)

Hereâs my story (to pay back those who inspired me):

Iâm 43, 5â10â, &amp; weigh 265. Iâve always been athletic, but battled weight much of my life. Iâve hovered around 300 for about the last 7 years. Tried several diets, but haven't kept weight off. Considered surgery, but after spending a lot of time on r/c25k, r/fitness, r/weightroom, r/loseit, I began feeling like if so many others were doing this, I could too. 

So, in August, I started hitting the stationary bike, weights, etc. I also started watching what I ate, but didn't get crazy with every calorie. Lost 15 lbs pretty quickly, but more importantly, I felt great. On 9/1 I got serious and started planning my workouts and diet better. I kept doing a good mix of cardio and lifting. 

On Thanksgiving I started C25K, but even though Iâd done 3 mos of exercise, the 1 min runs were tough and my heart rate monitor was jumping to 180! But, I followed the program religiously and my body just kept adapting! I had no failures in 9 weeks, but even if I had, it wouldnât have been a big deal.  I wouldâve just repeated and keep pushing along. I feel like I could probably run a 10k today if I really wanted to, but thatâs for another time. Iâm progressing carefully.

Iâve now lost 40 lbs, have seen nice progress in my weight training, and feel great. But most importantly, Iâve relearned an old lesson. The only way I can manage my calories is to exercise and be fit. When Iâm sedentary, Iâm hungry all the time and crave junk food out of boredom, stress, whatever. But when Iâm fit and healthy, I crave real food/fuel, and not every second. Diet just doesnât seem like a big deal when fitness is part of my lifestyle. It's a journey, but Iâd like to thank everyone on Reddit who helped me get a great start!

Keep going! You can do this!!

When my c25k app chimed in and said to start my cooldown, I kept running. I ran through the 5 minute cooldown, and I ran for another 10 minutes after that. I felt like I could run forever. I set a new distance record - 3.6 miles - beating my previous record by almost an entire mile. I also ran my fastest mile. Actually, I broke about 5 of my previous records.

So I'm calling myself done. Honestly, even though my c25k app has been telling me when to start and stop running, I've been largely ignoring it since week 5. I usually ran about 5 minutes past the recommended stop time, just because I felt like I could.

Of course, this isn't *really* the end. Even though I won't be following the program anymore, I've still got work to do. My 5k time ended up being 36 minutes; it needs to be under 30. My average pace is around 12 minutes per mile; it needs to be under 10. And I've got to do all that before I run an official 5k (in September). 

After that... who knows. I'll probably run until winter, then focus on lifting, then pick up running 5k's again next spring.

So, I went from being a 220 lb couch potato whos mantra was ""I hate running,"" to being a 180 lb ""Psh, 5k? no big D..."" and it was all thanks to c25k starting me down the path to health.

I told myself to stick it out until 15 minutes, and then I would only be 5 minutes away. I got to 15 minutes and couldn't believe I had made it that far.

I was trying to juggle all of my crap: Phone, broken key chain, glasses, busted up earbuds, and I was thinking, ""Fuck. I can't do this today"" all throughout the warmup. 

But I kept going, and halfway through, the wind picked up, blowing snow down from the trees and into my face. And I kept thinking, ""I cannot do this today.""

On my last segment (5 minutes), I had a visual lock on the bridge where I planned to turn around, and I thought, ""I can never make it there. This sucks so hard.""

At that point, I realized that I seriously needed to change how I talk to myself. Last time, I quit this program at right about this mark, and it was because I convinced myself that I couldn't do it. So this time, I decided that I needed to be my own coach. What would I say to someone else who was doing what I'm doing? 

I'd be much nicer, for one thing. I'd say, ""You CAN do it. It's not that far, you've gone farther, and think about how good you'll feel when you're at this spot in the trail on the way BACK from that bridge.""

So that's what I said to myself, and that's what I did. I completed W4D3, and now as I head into what I think will be my biggest challenge to date, I am committed to more positive self-talk. I'm thinking that it will make all the difference. 

TL;DR: Be your own coach: Positive self-talk can help you win the mental game. "	t5_2rgoq	True

This program is great. We had a weight loss 60 day challenge at my work. I knew diet would not be enough so I did this too. I lost 22 pounds. 13.15% of my body weight. I came it second by 10oz. 

My 5k was yesterday. it was a trail 5k. I came in 11th and 2nd for my age group M30-34. Only 8s behind 1st. If I knew I was that close I would have pushed a little harder. He passed my in the last .1m. I did all my training barefoot or in vibram five fingers. My time was 26:35. 

I did not think I would do as good as I did (and at times in the training did not think I would finish) my goals were to finish and to not walk at all. Nailed them both. My goals now are to bring that time down and go for 10k.

On a side note I found a great running/walking app. MapMyRun+ It's free and has a lot of tracking info and you can track your diet as well.

But now I'm stuck on week 4.  I can do the first three running sections alright, but that fourth one is tough.  It's a five minute section; today I ran half of it.  This is my third attempt.

But here's the thing, guys.  I'm going to be at the gym every other day running the week 4 plan until I can finish it.  If I have to add 30 seconds at a time to that last run until I can do the full 5 minutes, then that's how it's going to be.  And when I can finally finish the week 4 plan three times in a row, I will move onto week 5.  I'm pretty sure week 5 will also take me at least 2 weeks to successfully complete.  But that's ok.  Because I'm going to do it.  It's going to happen.  Whether it takes me 2 weeks or 6 weeks, I will be a person who can run 20 minutes without stopping.  And I'm never going back to being a person who can't.

I just wanted to post this for anyone who is struggling, maybe my mindset can help you to reframe how you think about your struggle.

With music I would only focus on the running and ""how hard it is"" dragging yourself down. With a podcast you're listening to the guys talking, not focusing on your running and before you know you hear the beep.

I also recommend the Bugle, which is a great podcast with some more adult humor about recent world news. I can't wait to run with a new episode of The Bugle.

I ran that little bit more, and then saw that I was only a few minutes away from 15 minutes. I'll just keep running and quit at an even 15 minutes. I did that, and then decided I could wait until the end of the current song on my Ipod, ""Let it Be"" from Across the Universe. But after that, I would definitely quit.

I have been running with my S3 for the last week since there was only slush on the ground, but a 25cm snowfall over the weekend meant I had to switch back to the galaxy S for yesterday's run.

The GPS on my galaxy S is miserable, it usually takes 5-10 minutes for a lock and once I have one I have to hold the home button and switch directly to the C25K app very quickly (which MUST already be open) or it loses its GPS fix as the C25K app seems to be incapable of getting a fix on this phone.  I was frustrated by the GPS and was in a rush so I forgot to skip forward in the C25K app to make up for the progress I had made while using my other phone (this phone showed W2D3 instead of W3D3).

When I finished the first jogging interval I thought it ended a bit early, just me getting better I thought, then the first walk interval felt too long (probably because I had only jogged 90 seconds before it instead of 180) so I started jogging early, then I jogged through the next jog interval, the next walk interval and so on.  Finally I reached the point where my legs felt too weak to continue jogging (for once my legs were the first thing to wear out instead of my lungs! Such a nice change!) and slowed to a walk, then pulled out my phone to check how long I had jogged for since I stopped paying attention to the jog/walk indicators after the first 2.

I had jogged for 17 minutes without slowing down!  It must have been some mental thing, blowing past the repeated jog/walk indicators maybe, that let me go that far as I have never jogged over 4 minutes in my life before last night (seriously).

This is my first post in this subreddit, but I just wanted to share how excited I feel with you guys.  I had no idea I had this in me!  I am sore in all sorts of new places in my legs after such a long jog but I feel great anyway.

That feeling that you're simply **untouchable**, that the world is YOURS. I fucking love that feeling of pain after running because it means that you worked hard for it and I like to call it a good pain, because that's just what it is, a good pain. 

You push yourself, your entire body to its limits, you're improving both physically and mentally. Will Smith once said that the one of the two keys to life is running - ""**When you're running, there's a little person that talks to you and says, ""Oh I'm tired. My lung's about to pop. I'm so hurt. There's no way I can possibly continue."" You want to quit. If you learn how to defeat that person when you're running, you will know how to not quit when things get hard in your life**."" I love that quote, it helped me when things got really hard. 

You get to clear your mind, it's my kind of meditation and I'd never give it away for anything. There's just so many pros to running that it's amazing. 

When you're running that one last sprint, don't run like you're being chased by a wolf. Run like **YOU'RE chasing** that wolf. 

Whether you're tall, short, fat, skinny, rich, poor, male or female you should always find time to run because it will improve you as a person.

This thread is for those who have fully completed the Couch to 5K program to share their successes. It's meant to inspire and motivate people who are currently doing C25K, give them advice from people who have been in their shoes, and most importantly, to give those have finished this difficult program the chance to stand up and be recognized. 

Some ideas for things you might include in your posts are:

* Info about you: your age, past running experience, what inspired you to start, etc.
* Tips for current participants
* Stories
* Difficulties and obstacles
* Before/after pictures
* Measurement changes (weight, etc.)
* Future running or general fitness goals
* Any other ideas you have

I suggest that we keep top-level comments limited only to those who have completed the program to give this a wall-of-fame feel. Also, I talked to tico24, and this thread should be on the sidebar soon.

Good job on your successes, everyone, and I can't wait to hear what you have to share!"	t5_2rgoq	True

Today, I did it. I completed W1D1. I even beat my fastest mile time from high school...but back then I weighed 340 lbs, so it's no hard task.

I never thought I'd be able to do it. The last interval I was hurting. Hell, I was hurting the first interval. My fastest pace was a whopping 14:30 minutes per mile, I was old lady shuffling all over the place. 

But I did it!!! I literally cried when the app told me I was completed. I was so grateful it was over and so happy I did it!

I'm going to make a leap and register now for a 5k in the fall. I'll show 'em. 

Also, for some advice - my next day, W1D2 is going to be on Thursday, when I usually go to a walking/running club. I don't want to do my C25k there - would I be okay if I did it in the morning, then walked another 2 miles in the evening?"	t5_2rgoq	True

I made myself a super peppy playlist (think Rocky soundtrack, Bon Jovi and Kenny Loggins, heh) and challenged myself not to look at a timer for at least 5-6 songs, since I have such a problem with clock-peeking. I just stared straight ahead at the moulding on the wall in the next room. About 10 minutes in, Livinâ On a Prayer started playing; if you can remember the lyrics to the chorus, youâll understand why I was amused about that. The treadmillâs timer was apparently just barely uncovered because I noticed a â2"" at the front and my jaw dropped comically, thinking I was already done (forgetting about warm-up). Because of that I looked at the app with 3:41 left.

As soon as I slowed for the cooldown I had the [biggest, dopiest smile on my face](http://i.imgur.com/vcj42dQ.jpg?1). I felt like I was going to cry. I couldnât believe Iâd done it. It wasnât easy, but it wasnât that hard either. Iâm capable of so much more than I thought, and that's the whole point, I think. W5D3 is a mindgame.

This must be what a ârunnerâs high"" feels like because I just havenât stopped bouncing around since then. And on that noteâ¦ Holy hell, ***Iâm a runner***!

1374785285.0	1j1wbz	I never thought I could do this...	bunnybuddy	49	4	18	"I have never, ever been a runner, but recently I had the crazy idea that I should try to run a 5K later this year.  I think the last time I ran was in elementary school gym class.  I would always dread the days the gym teacher made us run around the track, because I would inevitably have horrible heel pain and an asthma attack.  Sometimes I would end up crying during class because I was unable to keep up with my classmates and they would make fun of me.  Now, 25 years later, I have an inhaler for my asthma and insoles for my foot pain.  I want to think of running as a fun way to get fit, instead of the traumatic experience it was when I was a kid.

About a month ago, I first tried to start C25K.  I realized after a few minutes that I needed to improve my cardiovascular fitness before I could continue, but I kept trying. On Tuesday, I finally completed W1D1 of C25K.  This is probably not a big deal for most people, but for me it is huge.  I used to think I would never be able to do something like this, but now it seems achievable.  I had some calf pain while I was running (jogging, actually), so I know I need to work on strengthening my calf muscles and developing better form, but it wasn't enough to discourage me.  

Today I'm going to complete W1D2. Lurking on this sub and seeing everyone's progress has really helped to encourage me to do this. Thank you all!"	t5_2rgoq	True

It's still a lot slower than I would ideally like, but considering 8 weeks ago I got winded doing 1 minute runs, and now I can go out there and run for 30 minutes straight, I'm completely amazed and flabbergasted with my progress.

To preface, my yardstick is my past performance in the mile run, which is thoroughly unimpressive. Ground speed has never been my strong suite. I'm not exactly gifted with a gazelle's physique-- 5'2"", bad knees, flat feet, top-heavy, with a shuffling gait. My build is much more... I dunno... German peasant wench than it is marathoner. I'd estimate that my walking pace is 3mph. During high school gym, I clocked a mile at a grand 12:30 even though I was (nominally) jogging the entire time.    

So for me, a 9:10 mile is a huge achievement! I'm incredibly excited to get cracking on Week 5.

1358265293.0	16metz	Finished C25K, here's some advice for people starting out.	13717421	56	10	13	"Well, first of all, the C25K program is absolutely fantastic. When I started, I could run about a third of a mile comfortably, and a whole mile if I pushed myself to the brink of death. Now, 10 weeks later, I just went for a 4.5 mile run (which I'm incredibly proud of) and found it easy, and pretty relaxing. This program works. Now here is advice:

* Proper running shoes really do help. You don't need any of the other fancy gear (I ran with old cotton tops and socks for the first 8 weeks), but don't run in bad shoes. I'm probably an exaggerated case, because I started running in skateboarding shoes that should have been thrown away a year ago, but I found myself developing shin splints at the end of my runs. So I went to a running store near me, got fitted for shoes, and have had no problems with my shins since.

* You should record your progress. I use Runkeeper on my smartphone, and the GPS tracks my route, time, and pace, so I can obsess over my stats afterwards. It also records your personal records, goals, and plenty other stats. Plus it's free! ^other ^apps ^are ^available.

* Try not to get to over-do it, especially in your first few weeks. After a great run, it's easy to think ""I'm so damn fit, I'm going to run again tomorrow, I love running!"", which is good, but you run the risk of injuring yourself, and injury sucks. It's much better to take the rest days than to have to stay inside injured for a week or two. Also, slow down if you need to. My speed gradually decreased throughout the program, but it's picked up again at the end. With distance will come speed.

* Don't worry about breathing technique, breathe however feels natural to you. If you feel that you're doing something wrong, it's not your breathing, and you probably need to slow down.

* No matter how much I've dreaded a run, I've never gone out, come back, and regretted going. You'll hear that a lot anyway, it's the second most repeated thing in this subreddit.

* Running should be fun (most of the time). Don't forget that!"	t5_2rgoq	True
1358185877.0	16k821	Finished with a full 5K!	Eeshwan	50	4	4	"Finished the program for distance last night, thought I'd share my story and experiences. I first started the program in the fall of 2011, and ran for time on the long country roads outside my house. I got up to week 7, but fell off the horse for both running and eating healthy when I didn't get accepted to my first choice college. Obviously not a great reason, but hey, is any reason for stopping exercise good?

From that time until a few months into the start of college, I reverted to my exercise-less lifestyle, and played what was probably a bit too much league of legends.

I finally got back into the swing of things this past November, when I had a break from college and saw some of my high school friends for the first time in a while. One of them had been eating better and running for the few months we'd been apart, and it showed. I finally decided it was time to get going again on fitness in general, and c25k specifically.

I started the program back up around week 3, and ran on my college's track for distance, which I have found to be both a blessing and a curse; you can't cheat the track, but it did help by being a solid goal to reach each work out day.

Last night was supposed to be w8d1, but around lap 6 or 7, I decided to say screw it and run the full 3 miles. By the time you get to the later weeks, 1 more lap isn't that much. I also ran the additional half a lap to make the run an official full 5 kilometers, and felt awesome for it!

My time wasn't amazing, probably somewhere close to 40 minutes, but I'm going to start lifting next week with some cardio in between, and I plan to run inside on a treadmill now and slowly ramp up my 3 mile speed.

All of you guys still working on the program, you can do it! Keep in mind the accomplishment you are achieving simply by getting out there and running instead of sitting around."	t5_2rgoq	True

Advocate777	49	5	10	"Little background info, July 2011 I weighed in at 360 lbs. as a 6'0"" male and decided to finally do something about it.  I started walking, just a mile at first but adding more and more as the weeks went by.  By November last year I was doing either a 3.1 mile route or a 4.5 mile route every day of the week.

Somewhere along the line I decided I should work up to running a 5k, and by the time I had lost 80 lbs. I decided I was ready.  All that walking must have helped some because I was pretty sore after finishing running but never didn't finish.  Today, I completed running 30 minutes straight!  It ended up being 2.25 miles, so I have a bit of work to do on pacing before I'm fully there and losing the rest of my weight will help with that I'm sure, but I'm on my way!  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/L9M2Z.png) a map.

If anyone is interested in how I lost the weight, I did it by switching to a pescatarian diet and restricting my daily calorie intake to 1700.

1326835278.0	oldfx	I can finally say that I am finished.	Shadow14l	48	3	9	"At first I stayed very close to the C25K plan, skipping a few days here and there and I eventually started to challenge myself around Week 4-6. I've been pushing myself hard each time I run.

In fact W6D2 was fairly average for me, with W6D3 probably being my worst run. But I kept at it that day, thinking that things couldn't get any worse. The closest it has come to that is because of crappy precipitation.

Anyways today I just ran 4.77 miles in 50 minutes (that includes the 5 minute warmup and cooldowns. The last few times have been on the treadmill (because of the weather), and it's much, much easier to finely tune the speed I am running at and almost perfectly pace myself throughout the whole run, plus the fact that I'm in a very hilly area.

I am going to try to increase the distance and speed slightly each day I run. Eventually I will start to hit a rough slope, but I'll deal with that when I come to it.

Thanks for being an awesome community.

1321454203.0	meee9	I no longer accept that I am limited by genetics.		49	5	10	"My ENTIRE life, my family has told me that we're all 'built for distance, not speed.' My dad is obese, and while my mom and sister aren't necessarily overweight, neither of them put any sort of an emphasis on any degree of fitness. I've had to quit fitness routines in the past due to exhaustion/time, and my family has comforted me by telling me, in kind words, that I'd never really be able to be one of the fit people anyway, due to my genes.

Yesterday I realized that that's complete bullshit. I conquered Week 3, Day 1 yesterday, and I felt amazing. It made me realize that I AM capable of being a runner. On my running rest days, I've been going to the gym anyway to do pushups, pullups, squats, and situps. I'm up to 30 of each a day. I will get in shape if it's the last thing I do. I'm going to find a 5k in February to register for soon, and a few months after that I'm hoping to do a 10k. By this time next year I'd like to run a half marathon. That might not be realistic but I'd still like to shoot for it.

THANK YOU GUYS. Seeing your stories has made me realize that ANYONE who puts their mind to it is capable of doing this. After realizing that I am by no means 'genetically fat,' going to the gym is no longer a chore; it's something I look forward to. Today I can't make it there until 5:30 and that legitimately makes me sad. You guys are my HEROES."	t5_2rgoq	True

1372000827.0	1gwte8	Completed a 5k today (W6D3).	djangogol	49	4	7	"Yesterday a friend of mine who I've done a few runs with called to tell me there was a 5k on today. Without thinking about it I said yes.

A few minutes after I hung up, the magnitude of what I just agreed to hit me. I had never run in an organised event before and I was just in between W6D2 and W6D3. This was probably a bad idea!

Because I hate giving my word and backing out, and also not wanting to seem like a chicken, I decided to go along and do it anyway. There would be one compromise: I would attempt to run for about 3.5 or 4k since by my rough calculations, this would be just beyond what I should be capable of. I figured I'd just use the remaining distance as a warm down walk. In my mind this would still be me continuing the c25k idea of pushing yourself a bit further each time and also still getting the feeling of completing something I agreed to. 

Got to the start line this morning, signed up and started running. Within a few minutes the voices in my head started: ""you probably shouldn't be doing this."" ""you're tired."" ""Just stop and take an 'L'. Nobody will know anyway"" etc. I guess you could say its the usual stuff we all hear in our heads. The only difference is, I guess the newness of the experience of running with other people created a sort of anxiety in me and this caused the doubting voices to raise their heads extra early.

Eventually, I manage to get myself past the first kilometre and needless to say, everybody and their granny was already past me (at least, that's how I felt). At this point, the nature of the mental battle shifted to restraining my ego. Never mind that I was already punching above my weight by the fact of entering a 5k, my ego was making a pretty credible argument that I should NOT be allowing everybody to be running ahead of me. Thankfully, by the end of the 2nd km, I managed to subdue that voice and started focusing on the basics. For me, that was: move one leg -- move the other leg --  don't stop.

By the time I got to the 3km my body was pretty much spent and I was running on very little. For some reason, I decided to continue with my approach: one step... another.... another.... just one more etc.

Eventually I mosied past the 4km mark. 

I must say, it was pretty hard at this point because most of me wanted to just stop.  But there was just some small curiosity in me that urged me to see how much further I could go. That became my new motivation: 'how much more can you go?'

Before I knew it, i could actually see the finish line and after another mini-eternity, I made it. I finished my first 5k without stopping once. 

I can't explain how overjoyed I am that I did it. I haven't received the official time as yet but when I checked my watch it read 29 minutes and i never checked it until a good minute+ after the race ended so I'm guessing I actually did the run in about 28 minutes~. 

I think today helped me to more deeply appreciate one of the spin-off effects of doing a c25k programme. In addition to teaching your body durability, I believe the programme also teaches us to develop a kind of mental toughness. For me, this mental toughness that I've been slowly developing over the past 6 weeks is the same thing which served as an antidote to the negativity my mind was feeding me, which would have otherwise probably caused me to give up.

1371787074.0	1grw1z	I think I might actually cry a little bit.	Snake973	49	7	9	"It's not a super huge achievement, but it really symbolized something for me.  I ran 8-2 today and did really well.  I kept a steady pace the whole time and actually sprinted the last two minutes just because it felt good to do it despite choking on my own spit and having a coughing fit as soon as I stopped.  I don't know my actual pace but, I feel like it was just under or just over 10 min/mile, probably over.

What makes it important though, is that this time last year I was smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes every single day and drinking myself to sleep every other night.  I have been overweight and not incredibly healthy for two-thirds of my young life, and have lost 15 pounds since I started the program.  This is the first kind of exercise I've actually been able to stick with in my entire life.

The point is that I couldn't have done it without all of you amazing, determined people in this subreddit, who told me about C25K in the first place, and shared all of your motivations, failures, and successes along the way.  I seriously cannot wait for that 30 minutes run on Saturday.  I'm gonna do a week of 30 minute runs and then move on to b210k.

Also, I sincerely apologize to every phys ed teacher I ever thought was full of shit.

I was really happy that I completed W5D3 on my first attempt but was already embarrassed by my 13-minute mile pace and decided to push the pace on W6D1. BIG MISTAKE. I almost failed the first five minute run. I reassessed, changed strategy, and slowed down for the rest of the run, forcing myself to continue even when my mind was telling me that I had already failed. I made it through, but it was an important reminder for me: endurance first, THEN speed.

I also found it harder to break up the run with walking than to just run straight through. I'm glad the program is structured this way, though - if I had switched over to running all the time after W5D3 I know I would have looked back (wrongly) with longing at the time when I used to be able to walk some. Now I know that getting into the groove of running has its own benefits.

W5D3 taught me that I can do more physically than I think I can. W6D1 taught me that I can do more mentally than I think I can. C25K is giving me a whole new perspective on what's possible. We have more in us than we know."	t5_2rgoq	True

I figuere sports just never were a priority in my life. I'm more the book-loving person. But I've gone through med school, started working as a doctor and there just never was the time or the motivation for me to start doing something. Now, I happen to be on a break. I'm preparing some exams, have some free time on my hands and I figured it was time to get in shape a little. So far, I've loved the C25k program. I never would have thought, that I could run more than 5 minutes, but with the help of this subreddit, I noticed how everybody had the same doubts and I watched people overcome their doubts and I gained confidence, that I could do that, too.

Now, today I was out running my W8D1 (YAY). After about a 1/4 mile I have to cross the street to enter the park where I usually go running. I had to stop with some other pedestrians to wait for the light to  change so we could pass the street, and not wanting to interupt my run, I just kept running without moving forward (sorry, not an english speaker. I'm sure there's a better word for that.) 

So that woman turns to look at me and she starts shaking her head and laughing. Then she looks at me again, laughs some more and then we all cross the street and I run away. It wasn't a nice well-meaning laughter. It was a look-at-that-ridiculous-creature laughter. :-(

I felt angry and embarassed. Why would someone do that? I mean, obviously I might not be the most beatiful sight. My hair is a little greasy, because I run in the morning before I shower. I'm maybe a little on the chubby side. Not really fat (estimated BMI 23-24) just some unfortunate curves on my hips/thighs and my tummy. And I probably do look pretty ridiculous when I run. You know, like someone who's only started running a few weeks ago. Maybe a little uncoordinated or something. Also, I limp a little in the beginning, because my left knee has been hurting lately for  the first mile or so. After a while, it always gets better. 
But still, why would anyone be so mean and laugh at me?

I'm now having the esprit d'escalier and thinking of all the things I could and maybe should have said to that woman. But at that moment, I was too surprised to say anything. Also, I listen to that awsome podcast while running and there's no way I'm going to miss anything just to talk to a mean person.

Did this ever happen to you? How did you react? How did you get over it?

About halfway through our run/walk I had a realization that it wasn't that long ago that I was exactly where she is right now.  The idea of a 3-5 minute running split was absolutely killer just about 6 weeks ago.  And now I've run the 5k distance several times in training (First race is in about 3 weeks)

This made me realize that most importantly, she can and will make it to running a 5k as far away as it seems right now for her.

And, to try and take time to appreciate how far you have come particularly if you have a bad run one day or fall off the wagon for a little while.  My first two training runs were really slow times - I want to get under 30:00 minutes and right now I'm at about 36-37 - but to see running right next to me where I was recently gave me a little motivation to keep pushing to get a better time and get longer distances."	t5_2rgoq	True

1350330548.0	11izye	23 Year old. 300 lbs, 6 ft tall. Smoker. W2D1 done.	I_ate_paintchips	48	5	20	"I haven't done any type of workouts in about two years and spend most of my time behind a desk. Over those two years I gained about 80 lbs. I was sitting at 298 lbs for quite some time and while I hated that fact it never really hit me in the face that I needed to do something until I saw 300 on the scale. Although my feet were in pain, good pain mind you, I pressed on and completed my days. I am also a heavy smoker. I know I need to quit, but one thing at a time. I want to finish C25K and then move to quitting smoking. Although, running seems to make me smoke less so I guess; cause and effect.

I also quit drinking pop. Quit eating sweets. Eat less. Removed any kind of ""extra"" from my meals (Cheese, dressing, etc.). I'm resisting quite well.

The first week was tough on my feet and I took the time to stretch them once throughout all three runs only during my brisk walk periods. I never quit on a run. But today I finished W2D1 and my feet are starting to feel better. More than likely due to the fact that I haven't worn my running shoes in quite some time.

I've started on the treadmill since the areas around my home are quite hilly and will eventually move to the sidewalks probably mid-program. Treadmill is tough since you have to adjust your speed via control but I don't let that stop me. If I set the speed too high on one interval I finish it out and on the next one, I slow it down a bit. I do this mainly for motivation; 1. To make it so that I do not quit. 2. So I don't end up looking at the time too early. It always seems that looking at the time makes me think, ""shit, I still have ## seconds left."" 

TL;DR: Title says it all. Don't quit and you can achieve anything. It's never too late for exercise. Thank you /r/C25K for the motivation and a well put together program. Feels good man.

EDIT: Thanks to super_pickle and Zenderquai I'm going to quit smoking by the end of the weekend. The C25K community is full of motivation. Thanks again!"	t5_2rgoq	True

1343362141.0	x8bog	I just ran two miles without stopping for the first time in my life!	tangentc	49	5	5	"And a week ago, I had never even run ONE mile* without stopping! This week I ran one mile without stopping twice (I extended the running portions of week 5 days 1 and 2) and then ran for a full 20 minutes without stopping. I've been running on a treadmill because I was too self-conscious starting out to run outside when I had no endurance, but I promised myself that after I could run 20 minutes without stopping I would start running outside. I was honestly doubtful I'd ever even get to this point, having failed so many times before because I was discouraged about how bad I was at it. It feels great. On Saturday I'll repeat the 2 mile run outside to make sure I'm set to move forward doing the rest of the program outside, but tonight I'm rewarding myself by allowing myself to post my little success on reddit.

I want to thank runnit for being such an awesome community. I don't really post a lot here, but you guys are all so encouraging of beginners that it really made me feel less worried about looking like an idiot. I was always so afraid that other runners would judge me because I couldn't run very far or very long (and admittedly, there are some very catty runners where I live), but you guys are so encouraging, and it's really helped me to know that not everyone is like that. I know it's a bit early to be thanking the academy when I haven't even been nominated for an award yet, but I just wanted to say it.


*To be clear, I am aware that ""one mile"" on a treadmill doesn't equate to 1 mile outside because of variable terrain and wind resistance. I run on a treadmill at a 1% incline and multiply the distance reported by the treadmill by 0.9 to try to estimate the equivalent distance on a flat running path in good weather. So when I say I ran two miles, I mean I ran 2.22 miles on a treadmill at a 1% incline. Also, I've been measuring time (20 minutes in this case) rather than distance, so I actually ran a bit more than that, but it feels more concrete to me if I report a distance."	t5_2rgoq	True

I have wanted to be a runner for a long time, but after trying a couple different times to get into it, I would quit because of knee pain and asthma issues. Some friends were starting the C25K program though, so I finally looked into it. I read up a bunch, here on the forums, and elsewhere, and actually found a bunch of suggestions to help with knee and breathing issues. Apparently I had been doing everything so wrong, making running painful for me. Well, I decided this time I would really go for it! And I went for W1D1 this morning, and LOVED it! No getting winded, no pains. 

Granted, it was just the beginning, so I know it will get harder, but it feels so encouraging. This is my year to get healthy, I've already lost 55 pounds on Keto, and adding exercise in was my next step.

1371813450.0	1gsea5	5K Defeated!!!!!	arbitragr	45	5	10	"I've been doing C25k for a while now and have also been using it to ease into minimalist running with my vibram five fingers.

It hasn't been easy, I've failed days along the way and it's taken longer than it should have -- probably because of my own fault. I pretty much only run on the treadmills at my gym, so my experience running outside has been pretty minimal.

Still, before yesterday I had only completed W6D1 and had never really run a 5K. But yesterday I was pushed into running a 3.5 mile race in my city for my company and after much hesitation I went ahead and did it.

Surprisingly, I was able to complete the race without stopping and managed to do it at a pace I was happy with (10:00/mile). As a former fat asthmatic kid who was conquered daily by the track in k-12 PE class, let me tell you, this felt AWESOME! I never thought I'd be able to accomplish something like this and I just want to recommend that all of you guys stick with the program. It really does work.

Most of my hesitation centered around distance and the fact that I'd be running outside. I've watched a lot of pose running videos over the last year, so I knew how to transition my treadmill form to a form more adequate for running outside which helped a lot. 

I think one of my biggest takeaways is that at least for inexperienced runners, there's a big mental component. W5D3 really helps with that because it shows you that you can run for a continuous pace for a decent amount of time. During the race I really just tried to tune everyone and myself out by I listening to some Explosions in the Sky. Then, towards the last 5 minutes or so I put on some really upbeat motivating music, I think that totally helped me get through it.

I think the key is to just stick with the program. It really works!"	t5_2rgoq	True

I crossed that finish line running hand-in-hand with my friend (my coach), and my guy (who trained with me just to be supportive). I grabbed onto each of them after we crossed and broke down crying. This has been one of the biggest mental and physical struggles that I've ever put myself through, and that finish line moment was worth it. 


For those of you who are working through the program, all I can say is don't give up. Find your personal fire/reason to finish C25k and hold onto that desire in those moments where you want to stop running or quit. It is the most amazing feeling ever to cross a finish line knowing all your hard work and discipline paid off.

1.  You will only lose weight if you track your calories and eat less than you use.  It's pretty simple.  I am NOT doing that at the moment (I'm eating like crap, actually), so I am not losing weight, despite exercising five days a week.  (I'm going to start eating better in  January for a Biggest Loser competition with a $1,000 prize I have a pretty legit chance of winning.)

2.  HOWEVER:  My legs!  I am getting pretty legs again!  My calves are defined, and my ankles are smaller, and my thighs are toning up (at least the part near the knees).  I can feel the muscles beneath the chub, whereas before it was all just squish.  Basically:  Who cares if you lose weight or not?  Your body will be better because of it.

3.  I am moving freer - I don't know how else to put it.  I just walk easier, and move easier, and feel better about myself, even if I haven't dropped a pound.

4.  Rheumatoid Arthritis - This won't apply to many people, but in case someone does search..... My RA keeps trying to flare up.  I'm off my meds at the moment due to insurance change, and it's not happy.  If I were in the middle of a flare up (it affects my knees and ankles) there's no way I could do this.... but because it's only trying to flare (this will make sense to other RA people, hopefully)  holy crap - the running is actually HELPING.  I can just feel... I dunno.  Like the fluid is less stagnate?    

Basically - I am pushing through the pain and stiffness, and by the end of the run, my knees hurt less, rather than more, as you might expect.  On days I am flaring hard, I run anyways, and I have not regretted it yet.  The first half of the run sucks pretty bad, but by the end of the run my body is moving freer, kind of like how it feels after a hot shower.  I figured I had nothing to lose by trying this program, and I am so glad I did.

However, now that I'm in grad school, I decided it was time to start working on it again, and figured I'd pick up where I left off.  I finished up week 4 earlier this week, and then decided to do week 5 day 1 today.  

However, an odd thing happened when I was finishing up the first 5 minute run, I actually wanted to keep running!  I told myself that I would keep going until I needed to take the 3 minute walk break, and go from there...except I didn't stop until 25 minutes later!

I was amazed, exhilirated, and felt great after pushing myself to keep on going.  I only went 2.25 miles, but for someone who is 6'1"", and 285 pounds, and has never run more than 3 minutes straight in his life, I felt like I was on top of the world.

W3 I made a single sheet plan that included C25K, /r/100pushups and /r/200situps schedules. Every day that I completed I marked with an orange marker at the top. I was hoping the psychological effect of keeping a streak and hating to see the line break would motivate me on the low days. It worked! The fact that it hung on the refrigerator door also helped. Here's the completed log: http://imgur.com/b5adn

P = pushups, S = situps, TDK = taekwondo

I could not get past W3 of /r/100pushups (had to keep repeating W2 or W3), but overall went from 12 in a row to 32. Situps seemed much easier and went from 25 to 80. I had struggled with diet for several weeks, but overall lost about 14 lbs or so.

What's next... I am going to keep running ""slow"" for at least the next six months. From doing research, speed should come naturally from this sort of consistent running. I made another sheet for the next 9 weeks that will add a 4th day/week of running and gradually ramp up to running for a 60-minute stretch on the last week's long run. I'm also going to scale back pushups and situps in favor of a more general core routine [like this one](http://strengthrunning.com/2012/01/the-standard-core-routine-video-demonstration/).

I still ran non-stop to the second water station around the two mile mark. I was worn out and over heating at this point, so I walked for about a block and a half. The rest of the race was a struggle to finish. I finally made it to where I could hear the music from the finish line around the corner, and I tried to pick up the pace. I finished with a time of 30:44, 9:55 pace. I finished 209 out of 440, and 8 out of 12 in my age class.
I had a blast running my first race, and left excited to run another.

After talking with some runners from work I decided to try and build a base of around 15-20 MPW, with one day of speed work a week, either sprints or tempo runs, and a long run on the weekend. The farthest I have made it is 5 miles. My wife has been kicking my butt on distance, and She ran 7 miles last week ""just to see if she could do it"". She has not had a chance to enter a race yet due to work, but I hope to find one we can do together soon. That leads Me to My second official race.

Yesterday Aug 3 I ran My second 5K race. The race started at 8:00 a.m., and was a trail run on a really nice oil and chip trail, but ughhh lots of hills. The weather was great, overcast and cool. This race was a little different, and had pace setter volunteers who held pace times on cards the whole race. This makes it really nice to get an idea of where to line up at the start, and to keep from going out to fast. the race started, and I tried to keep the 10 min pace runner in sight. It started out flat on a paved road, but quickly hit the trail, and the hills started. There are no hills in my town, so I wasn't sure how I would do. I felt pretty good about myself after a mile and a half or so when I started passing walkers at the tops of hills. I had to slow down several time to catch my breath, but I never stopped running. I finished with a time of 30:40, 9:53 pace. I came in 191 out of 363, and finished 10 of 17 in my age class. I had a blast at this race, and plan on making the trail a semi-regular running spot to work on hill running.

For those of you just starting, or those who are wondering if you will ever get better at this. Stick with it. I thought I was going to pass out after ever run the first few weeks. C25K works! If someone told me last year that this year I would be running 3 miles up and down hills for fun, I would not have believed them.

1375120864.0	1jagnw	Done.. I can't believe it!	sevillamaster	42	2	6	"C25K is done. Seriously I can't believe it.

Through all of this I had my fair share of troubles.. from breathing problems to shin pain to motivational issues. But I worked through it all..
12 Weeks ago (repeated 2 weeks) I nearly died running 60 seconds straight. Being a smoker most certainly didn't make life easier.

But at some point during W3 something clicked within me. I found a pace I was comfortable with, managed to breather properly and mentally really got into C25K.

And today I finished it all with the W9D3 run.. didn't quite make it to 5k, though. I'm 130 meters short (so covering 4,87km) including the warm-up and cooldown walks.

None the less I did run 96 km in total and spent 15hrs and 24min doing so. And even though I hated a lot of it all..I'm hooked now.

My first 5k will be at the 1st of September, so there is plenty of time left for the final bit. I plan on upping the time to 35 min of running, taking time from the cool down walk (which I do anyways, just not counting it in). Also I plan on including some sprints and some hill work. And hopefully I will be able to get a &lt;40min time by September. 

Now.. I also want to thank each and everyone of you! Every time before a run I came here to get some motivation off all the lovely, funny and motivational posts you guys made.

I was so stoked to actual be able to finish it and that I was able to run the whole thing without stopping once and I finished in the middle of the pack, not near the end like I thought heh.

About 2 weeks ago I was on a run and noticed my right hamstring was tight and starting to hurt when I ran.  I was worried, because not finishing programs like this is a pattern in my life, so I was determined not to let it stop me, I was going to finish this program!  I did the RICE thing for the first 2 days (Rest Ice Compression Elevation) and it felt pretty good after that.  I read up on hamstring injuries and realized I ran too forward and it put too much strain in my hamstring.  I started running more upright and after a couple of shorter runs (I did some earlier weeks runs with more walking in it) I felt good enough to pick up where I left off.  Changing the way I ran allowed me to finish.

I couldn't be happier to be a runner.  I upgraded and now am doing the 5k to 10k program.  I am also planning on running a sprint triathlon in the fall.  It is all because of this program and I am looking forward to more challenges.  Thanks everyone for your inspirational stories and comments."	t5_2rgoq	True

Especially when you consider that on W1 D1 I nearly threw up in the bushes by the side of the road, having done my first outdoor run of my adult life two days after packing in the fags.

I've been looking forward to this for days, which shows a real change in mentality from the first few weeks when I was dreading having to go out and run.

After many weeks reading over posts here and r/loseit, I thought if all you awesome people could do it, I could do it too.  So last weekend I got fitted for my first proper pair of running shoes, replacing my six-year-old and much-punished Reeboks.  Ended up with some incredibly light and comfortable New Balance runners that give me the stability I need for the way I walk.  Thank you, slightly trained guy at Athlete's Foot.

Today I did W1D1 and to my immense surprise I did not have a heart attack, break my ankles, blow out my knees or even get a stitch.  Instead I got very sweaty and my calves are protesting a bit, but otherwise it feels great to finally make that first step (pun intended).

Now, I sort of understand why people run. The repetitive motion, the break from distractions and stress of modern life, the chance to be outside to breathe non-recycled airâ¦ there really is a bizarrely calming and meditative aspect to running.

I'm 264 lbs.  I'll say that again, ""264 lbs!!""  I ran for 20 minutes two weeks ago.  I ran for 25 minutes last week.  I didn't think that was possible for someone my size.  Sure, I wasn't very fast, but I was running.

Now, I'm going to be running three days a week.  At my current pace that will be over 2 miles.  And I'm having fun.  Fun... while running... it's all so confusing.

Starting this week I'm thinking about throwing some Convict Conditioning into the mix.  I have no money or time (28, 2 kids &lt;2 yo, 1 income, etc.) for the gym or free weights (cause Starting Strength looks cool).  Tony annoys me (p90 &amp; p90x).  And I used to like body weight exercises.  

I'm also looking into running drills I can do before my runs.  I figured I should start those now.  Better late then never and better early than late.  *I think I made the left into cliche-ville now.

All told almost 20 lbs lost in 6 weeks.  Quit smoking and using myfitnesspal to track calories.  Still eating whatever I damn well please just not as much of it.

I was going to save this rant/progress update until I was done, but I wanted to say something.  I don't know why.  Maybe I'm just avoiding work.

Anyway, I look forward to seeing where this goes.  I plan on starting b210k after this.  That is mostly to get me running 60 minutes at a time.  Then, I'll start doing some intervals to enhance my speed and weight loss.  Then, my friend wants me to start training for the Marine Corp Marathon (End of Oct).  

""One step at a time."" I told him.

But what do you think?  5'5"" and 280 lbs of gaming, sysadmin, lackadaisical lump into a marathon runner in 1 year?  Probably not a fast marathon runner but 26.2 miles is 26.2 miles.  Oh well, we'll not focus on that so much.

I've read both here and other places that a lot of people psyche themselves out over this one, because it's hard to get over the mental hurdle of ""I don't get to walk at all,"" so I tried really hard to stay positive and believe that I could do it. 

And I could. I did. And at no point in time did I feel so overwhelmed that I thought about stopping. I kept hitting little mini walls and then blowing through them and feeling great.

I couldn't understand why Week 5 was set up the way it was until just now - after finishing day 2 of it. It's to help you figure out how to get past the 'breath wall'. :D

I'm positive I'm not alone in there being this section of your run where you suddenly feel like you're unable to do anything but shallow breathe and you're not getting enough air to your lungs to keep going. While I'm sure a good amount of this is the mental battle, it can really get a person's anxiety up QUICKLY and make them consider stopping. 

Today, though, I figured out that if I focus myself on breathing from the diaphragm at that point, it breaks down that wall instantly, and I can breathe normally again... and no matter how many times someone tells you about it, you don't learn it for yourself until you're there. 

In any case, I'm feeling like a total rock star now, and I'm CONFIDENT that I will pass W5D3 on my next run day. :D"	t5_2rgoq	True

I ran every other day and never ran longer or farther that the program recommended.  After I completed W4D2, I was so excited! I was starting to mentally prepare for my twenty minute run in week 5.  The day after completing W4D2, I woke with pain in the inside of my left knee.  As my day progressed, the pain got so bad I was limping.  Thinking it was just joint pain,  I backed up my workout to week 3 and kept running.  After two weeks of nonstop, increasing pain I went to see my Dr.  My doc just called with my MRI results - I have a freaking stress fracture!  I was so let down and discouraged I just cried.  I feel like I'll never be a runner.  Now I can't even put weight on my leg and have to use crutches.  I'm sorry guys, I just had to vent...

1363890683.0	1aqwo7	DONE!!! And signed up for my first 5K! 	tatowtot	44	3	9	"I finished running my first full 5K earlier this week, with a time of 33:41, and I can hardly believe it. Whenever I think back to January when I was getting started and remember not being able to run a MINUTE without stopping, it blows my mind that I can run 3 WHOLE MILES now!

I signed up for my first 5K this Saturday (company-sponsored!) a while ago as a way to make sure I finished training, and I'm excited to run this weekend! It's supposed to be about 40 degrees and raining/snowing/sleeting so...that may suck. Regardless, I'm going to run as well as I can and post pictures when I'm done! 

As seems to be tradition, here are some thoughts/lessons that I hope will help current/potential C25K-ers!

1) PACE YOURSELF. I know I'm beating a dead horse, but work on endurance, then on speed. 

2) Pick some great music - build a running playlist, and use music with various tempos. I'm the sort of runner that needs everything to be just right in order to run well, so in the beginning I spent way too much time fiddling with my iPod and would slow to a walk when I couldn't find music I wanted. Picking back up to running after that was difficult! Eliminated the problem once I made a playlist. 

3) It's okay to take a day or two off, especially if you're feeling too sore. I would guilt myself into running (because I felt fat, and that's a separate discussion all together...) and would run 5-6 times a week. Some people can do this without issue, but I wasn't ready, especially at the beginning of the program. Ended feeling burned out, tired, sore, and unhappy all the time. Started alternating strength/cardio days, and I've found I perform better after days off. 

4) If possible, run with a friend/partner/SO/pet. I started the program with my roommate. Now that we're done, I've started running with my boyfriend, who is annoyingly athletic. :) In any case, running with someone keeps you accountable - on days where I felt lazy or didn't want to run, I would remember that I couldn't leave my roommate hanging, so I'd head out!

5) And finally, during moments of weakness (""I'm too lazy"", ""I'm too tired"", or ""I don't have enough time for this""), just run. JUST GO. Just start. And if in 5 or 10 minutes you still feel crappy, then stop. But I found that once I started, I was good to go for the whole 30 minutes. And remember - it is just 30 minutes!

GOOD LUCK ALL AND HAPPY RUNNING!!! :)"	t5_2rgoq	True

During C25K workouts, I was always running SOOOO slowly, just shuffling along and it made me so out of breath. My lungs were definitely my limiting factor in this. 

Well these days, I'm using the app on Week 1 to do interval training (running slowly on the walk portions and sprinting on the runs). Whats crazy now is that I'm faster than my original shuffle on the ""walk"" portions, and it feels easy and gets my heart rate down from the sprints. 

So even if you feel like you're going ridiculously slowly now, keep it up! Your speed WILL improve if you keep training. Good luck to everyone!"	t5_2rgoq	True

1355722696.0	14zawt	I'm officially done! Here's my epiphany. 	cjs2443	44	4	10	"I wasn't going to post on completion of this program, but I had a couple of epiphanies along the way that I felt I should share, in case someone else could benefit by hearing them. 

I spent 10 years of my life believing I couldn't run. As a kid, I was fairly athletic. I did gymnastics, soccer, dance classes, swimming, you name it. However, somewhere along the way, I lost track of that girl and gained a whole bunch of weight through my stressful years of middle/high school. In middle school, I decided I would join athletics and I stuck with it the entire year. However, I didn't respond well to being yelled at and they would always force me to run until I could no longer breathe. I have exercise induced asthma. I know, âexercise inducedââ¦I thought it was ridiculous when the doctors told me, but not being able to breathe, as any asthmatic knows, is pretty horrifying regardless of what you call it. Every day, for an entire year, I was run so hard I would gasp for air, and I never got better. I dreaded my elective athletics more than any other class I took. So, I simply assumed that I was just built wrong and couldn't run. 

Fast forward, I am now 23 and I started trying to lose weight. I had just graduated from college and decided with my down time, I might as well do some self-development (on some good advice from a friend). I started the program tentatively, knowing I could stop if I couldn't breathe. And now, here I am, 9 weeks later. My 5k takes around 38 minutes. I can jog for 70 minutes (5 miles) â slower than the average bear maybe, but I donât care. Because now I know that those coaches were wrong. I donât know if they didn't care or they didn't know what they were doing to me, but now I enjoy running. I go trail running and love that I feel like I can go forever (for a while at least). My lungs donât feel like they shut down on me. 

So in short, here I am. 5â1ââ, 190 lbs (I've lost 15 since I started the program, 30 since I started trying to lose weight) and still going. I am still substantially overweight, but it doesn't matter. Iâm still working at it, and I did it. The biggest barrier for me was/is trying to correct 10 years of beliefs. Believe you can do it. Slow and steady win the race. All of these are clichÃ©, I realize, but they are oh so true. Why else would they be said so much? 

tl;dr: Really overweight person completed the program anyway, despite believing for 10 years that I wasnât cut out for it.

My family and I started the /r/keto diet almost 3 months ago and it's done really well for us. I'm down 38lbs so far and I decided to start the C25K program this week.

I just got finished with Day 1 and I'm confident that I can do this. I only managed to go just under 1.5 miles but I know that, 3 months ago, I wouldn't have been able to make it **half** that distance.

I just wanted to say to anyone else reading this... if you're worried about being overweight and this being too hard...

It *is* hard. But if my short fat ass can do it, *anyone* can do it. And it is going to get easier, and it's going to get harder too... accept that. **But don't let that scare you away from getting out there and just doing it**.

I know it's early in the game, and a lot of people start things like this without finishing them... but I'm putting this up here as a sort of world-wide commitment to keep at it, and keep it up, **no matter how hard it gets**.

So, after several failed attempts at staying with the program in the year prior, I pushed myself to complete the program this time around. At first, I was always out of breath and my chest hurt. Even running at a constant pace for a minute was difficult. 

I wouldn't say I was overweight when I started but I sure was carrying a little bit of unwanted baggage that I seemed to pack on after I became depressed. So, desperate to become more healthy, I persevered through the weeks, working hard to increase my stamina and speed.

When I began, I clocked in the 20 minutes of interval jogging at a measly pace of 14'31""/mile. Slowly and with dedication, I managed to complete each week. Eventually, I finished my last run of the program with an average pace of 9'27""/mile. 

I was so happy at the amount I have improved and accomplished. I am a lot more fit than I have been in years and although I am still at the same weight, I lost my gut and my legs got so much bigger :D. Now, I hope to continue running and further increase my overall fitness. I could not have done this without the support of this community.

Since then, multiple things have happened to slow down my progress with the program (broke a toe, had insane crazy influenza, etc.) and I even had to stop for a whole month to heal my body/silly toes. So while I've been working on it for months, I'm not technically finished yet.

But today I just decided, fuck it, doing it live. I wanted to test myself to see how long I could run without feeling like I was going to keel over and die. When I couldn't run, I was training on my crappy locked gear shopping bike, and I've been trying to keep as active as possible. I put in a generic 30 minute run on my phone app and said I would only go as far as I could, especially since it was raining and my glasses were foggy and I cut my foot last week and...

..and fuck all the excuses, because I actually got stubborn and did the whole damn 30 minutes! My speed was slow but steady, about 4.6mph throughout. But I don't care...

Now that I'm in college, I'm still exactly the same. I discovered c25k and said I'd run this, but I procrastinated for a few weeks.

Then I started it spontaneously to get thoughts of a girl I fell over out of my head, originally. I know I could barely run 3 minutes nonstop at the time.

Well, there are signs of improvement. Last Thursday was the first time I could play indoor footie (soccer) and actually move the whole time. It was so surprising, and I ended up playing the whole hour before being out of steam, in comparison to just 10 minutes or so before.

Yesterday, I knew I was going to run w5d3: 21 minutes nonstop. I wanted to fucking stop after about what I presume to be 10 minutes, but I thought, if I quit, I'll have to run another 10 mins the next time and not pass this day.

When I started, 60 seconds of running completely wiped me out but, 9 weeks later, I can run for 30 minutes and feel pretty good when I finish.  I haven't run since playing sports in highschool many years ago and now I run three or four times a week.  I ran my first 5K last weekend in a respectable 29:16.  

Some things that helped me:
-Set a goal. It is hard for me to stay focused when I don't have a tangible goal I am reaching for. When I started, I signed up for a 5K.  Having that event (and the non-refundable registration) gave me concrete motivation to follow through.

-Accountability.  I told my family and friends about the race and the training program.  Having people ask me about it and encourage me really helped. And, I have to admit, having my ego hurt if I didn't do it would have been really hard.

-Priority.  There are a million things that will get in your way and there is always an excuse not to run.  I started out running at night but I work full time, have a large family and my wife is starting a business so there were too many things distracting me.  So, I started running in the mornings while everyone else was still asleep.  I actually grew to enjoy my time and now find I miss running on the off days. 

-Believe you are worth it.  Every one of us deserves to feel good about ourselves.  I have struggled with depression in the past.  Doing the C25K program really was a boost to my self esteem.  Seeing my kids cheer for me as I passed the finish line was one of the highlights of my life.

1375988126.0	1jz1zi	Done. What I've learned.	illumen8	42	1	13	"This week I've fully finished up the program.  I've run a full 5k a couple of times now, and I'm feeling relatively comfortable with it.  Not sure if I thought I was actually going to get through it when I started, but here I am.  My advice for those starting out:

* Invest in a good pair of shoes.  Get fitted for them, don't just go with what you think your size is.  I was surprised.
* Focus on running time, not distance or speed.  Speed comes later.
* Be consistent.  Get out there three times a week.  Change your mindset to ""this is just something I do now"", don't treat it like an option.
* Trust the program.  Do not run more than the program dictates, especially if you have been relatively sedentary.  Too much too early is just going to discourage you.

Finally, I'd say that this board is full of awesome people, who are more than willing to give you all of the encouragement that you need.  I'd like to thank everyone here for being so helpful and positive.

1370167257.0	1fih5n	Not the smartest move, but I did it anyway.	Propaganda_Penguin	45	5	5	"Yesterday I was due to start W6D1. I was most definitely not in the mood to run. Despite my laziness, I laced up my shoes and headed out. Up until this point, I'd only ran about 1.5 miles nonstop.  I didn't even start the C25K app, I just ran. I wanted to prove to myself that I was a runner. 

As the first mile came and went, I felt good. My pace was around 13:00, which is about my average. A short time later, mile two was in the books and I'd officially ran further than I had in five years. My mind and body felt good. Elated from my accomplishment, mile three fell quickly. A 5k no longer seemed so daunting.  My legs felt good, so my run continued. It wasn't until my girlfriend passed me on her way to my apartment that I stopped. As I walked to the window of her car to say hello, I heard it from my GPS app. Mile 7 completed. It was the furthest I've ever ran. 

My legs felt good as I ran the last half mile home. This morning they are very stiff, but I'll be taking a few days off. It was not my wisest move to push my body so far, but I needed to see my limit. I needed to show myself that a 300lbs ex-smoker can be a runner. 

Thanks for the encouragement C25K!"	t5_2rgoq	True

I am a 30 year old mom of 4 kiddos, 2 have special needs and the baby has had several brain surgeries. My life is crazy busy which has lead me to eat fast food a lot on my way to therapies, hospitals, doctors ect. 

So far in the last year I am down 80 lbs with little to no exercise, just changing my eating habits. I have signed up for a 5k (actually the color run) in August and I need to be ready for it. :D Even if I walk the whole thing I don't care, just signing up for it was a step in the right direction. 

Now, my question. Has anyone else done this program being very overweight (like 300+lbs) 

Just curious if they had to take is slower than recommended or if they were able to go at the recommended pace. "	t5_2rgoq	True

My back went out 3 weeks ago... 2 days after I dropped $340 on 2 new pairs of shoes.    I'm finally healed up enough to go running, so I got up an hour early for a half hour run at work (I work at a school with an indoor track), and just as I was on my way out the door, I was asked to assist with the special needs student bus run, which would take up my free hour.

Today I said screw it.  Signed up for the Half Marathon.  It has a 3h30 cut off time, which means I'll have to be able to run at least 10k by January.

What makes this time different? This time I realize it needs to be me as the motivator. I've been trying to do this for the woman I love, because she wants me to be healthy. She just dumped me, and I'm beginning to realize I need to do things for myself instead of for others. While I would love this to show her that I'm not a lazy good-for-nothing, that is secondary now, I need to be healthy for my own sake. Anyways, I just felt like I should share that.

1355162732.0	14m4u5	Completed my 5k on Saturday - wasn't happy with time.  Ran a second 5k on Sunday!	Herbie555	45	6	2	"Thanks to everyone here!  I love this program and I love this community.  I ran my first ""regular"" (i.e. no Zombies, timed race) 5k on Saturday.  It was a bit disorganized and I had some problems getting a good pace going.  (Dodging dozens of families w/ children who didn't respect the self-sorting-by-pace guidelines,etc., plus it was an out-and-back that was all downhill on the way out and all uphill on the way back - really threw me!)

At any rate, I ran a 33:45, which was OK, but I felt I could do better.  More importantly, I finished feeling really good!  

On Sunday we were hosting a ""Welcome Home"" party for a neighbor just back from Afghanistan and I wanted to have some extra calories to enjoy the meal, so I bundled my daughter into the jog stroller and went and ran a second 5k around the local lake.  I felt fantastic!  The stroller slowed me way down (36:38), but I had no pain or fatigue from Saturday's race (which obviously means I should have tried harder on Saturday!).

Anyhow, I owe so much to this great community.  Cheers to you!

For those who've done it before me, thanks for the support.  For those who are still working your way through: YOU CAN DO IT.  The human body is AMAZING.  I could barely run 30 seconds when I started a few months ago!"	t5_2rgoq	True
1354588538.0	148lya	After weeks of putting it off, I completed W1D1 tonight	NickVenture	42	2	11	"I put it off for multiple reasons. I was technically homeless for a month (sleeping on friend's couch). I went on vacation. I started drinking everyday. And all that.

But tonight I decided I was through. It was an unseasonably warm day today and I said ""after work, I'm going to do this."" And I did.

I bought the official C25k Android app a while ago. I loaded up the regimen and went after it. I'm lucky that I live within 5 minutes of the outdoor track at the college here. I was able to run it tonight. I got in 2.3 miles. I didn't get winded. I'm a little sweaty. And I actually started smiling at the halfway point.

I think I'm actually looking forward to completing this program. 


My story: I've always bee pretty sedentary. But skinny my entire life. These past three or four months I've packed on about 10 to 15 pounds. That doesn't seem like a lot, but it is when you've weighed less than 150 pounds your entire life. I'm flabby (I'm very close to having full on man-boobs), my thighs have enlarged considerably, and my stomach is now much more rotund than it ever should be.

I've been doing much less eating fast food and now I'm going to start doing the exercise I need to actually help me shed some of this weight and get in shape.

I'm posting here so I can have some accountability for myself. I have the reddit community here for more motivation, and I have a few RL friends that know my username so if they decide to check my post history they can hold me accountable too.

Now I just gotta prepare for outdoor winter running because I know not every day is going to be nice as today."	t5_2rgoq	True

I am so happy, I have no idea how I did it but it's all thanks to C25K and you guys!

I felt like I still had a bit left when the app told me to slow down and I was expecting a poor result, boy was I wrong :D

I know it's 3.1 miles and technically a couple meters off 5km but I'm happy and 5k sounds better than 4.99k :)

I can safely say this was my best run ever, lets see what tomorrow has in store.

1353583248.0	13m7qb	Thoughts (mostly ramblings) from someone who has recently finished.	steste	43	5	10	"So as some of you may have read I recently reached week 7 and found myself able to run 5k.  Since this day last week I have ran 4 5K runs with a personal best so far of 28mins 35 seconds (I would have beaten that his morning if it wasnt for having to navigate flooded paths!)

So like everyone else I'd like to share a few things I have picked up along the way.  Everybody is different.  The comments below are mainly directed at myself but hopefully they may be of use to someone.

1. **Slow Down** Yes everyone says it but its without a doubt the best advice for anyone starting to run.  I have lost count the number of times I have decided running was going to be my regular exercise but I just couldn't do it.  I was always going too fast.  Slow it right down.  It may seem like you are hardly running at all but even a shuffle is enough when you are starting.  Think you cant make it to the end of that interval? DONT STOP! Just slow down and you will make it!

1. **Hydration** Some of my toughest runs were, and still are, ones where I have not drank enough before heading out.  I'm an early morning runner and have never really drank a lot of fluids in the evenings but I've had to force myself on nights before I run.  If I dont I really struggle.  Its important to be hydrated enough to manage your run but at the same time drinking a load of water just before you go out isnt going to help as you'll feel it sloshing about inside you and its just not pleasant.

1. **Rest** Rest days are there for a reason.  If you havent done much exercise before starting this program your body needs time in-between each run to recover.  Even if you have been a regular exerciser chances are you are using different muscles.  I learned this one the hard way and started running on rest days.  Was out for almost 3 weeks with a foot injury.

1.  **Its all in your head**.  You can do this. Your legs aren't about to fall if you dont stop right now.  Your lungs are not going to explode.  So much time during my runs is spent arguing with myself.  My head is saying stop but I know I can do it.  Its a mind game.  You've already won the first battle with your head by getting out there and doing it.  Dont let it win once you are out there.  Keep things slow and steady and you will win. 

1. **Dont look outside!** As I said I'm an early morning runner.  I get out of bed and head straight out there.  If I look outside and see horrendous weather its so much harder to force myself out.  I now make sure that the first time I see what the weather is like is after I'm all ready to go in my running gear and I open that door to start the run!  Obviously this one only works if you run first thing in the morning!

1. **No excuses**.  So its raining outside. Or a bit cold. Or you had a late night and are kind of tired.  You're going to get all wet and sweaty anyway.  You'll warm out once you are out there.  The run will wake you up!  So often our reasons for missing a run are just simple excuses.  This is linked to point 4.  Stop making excuses and get your ass out there.  You made this decision to change your life and start this plan.   Dont let the lazy version of you win. 

1. **Clothing**  You dont need fancy gear to get out there and run. That old pair of shorts and Tshirt you have will do just nicely.  You can pick up a half decent pair of running trainers for not a lot of money. DOnt be swayed by the big brands.  I did buy new trainers but they were only Â£40.  The only other things I have bought are a arm strap for my phone and a couple of base layer tshirts as its getting a bit cold.  None of this is expensive.

1.  **Its ok to fail**  So you just had to stop during a running interval.  You are such a failure right? You can never complete anything you set out to do right?  Bullshit!! you are out there running.  You have already succeeded in changing who you are.  The fact you failed an interval or a run shows you are pushing yourself.  Take pride in the fact you are out there trying.  Give it a day or two, lace up those shoes and get back out there.  This program is designed so you can fail.  You can see exactly how far you've come and you can carry on repeating days until you get it right.  Never forget the fact that just by getting out there you are making yourself a better person

1. **/r/c25k**  This place - use it.  It was this subreddit that inspired me to get out there and try this program. It was here I came to for advice, to read stories from other people at the same point in the program as me.  Its an amazingly friendly, helpful community with so many people willing you on.  Take advantage of that."	t5_2rgoq	True

The 20 minutes interval scared me so I began slow but increased my speed once I realized I had run 10 minutes and did not feel very tired.  According to map my run, I was doing a 12is minutes mile, which dammit, I'm proud of considering a few weeks ago there is no way I would have been able to run a mile straight. Finished the entire run at 2.9 miles, my longest one yet! Bring it on week 6!

EDIT: I've tried using the 8 tracks app to get some great playlists to listen to.  It works great in my house with wifi, but when running with it, one song will play then it will stop.  Anyone else having issues?"	t5_2rgoq	True
1342229166.0	wj32b	How I felt about finishing up W6, I originally posted this as a comment.	kidkush	46	5	8	"W6D3 is where everything you worked hard for begins. The end of the beginning to say.

W6D3 is 25 minutes, no more breaks, no more walking, just you and your feet moving to the pace of your music or the road or the wind.

Nothing to distract you, no time to ease the pain, you just keep on running, and running, and running, and you look back.

You look back to the time when you thought your first 3 minute run was hard and now the last three minutes seem to be the hardest.

You look to the future and see yourself running not 25 minutes but 2.5 hours, for that half marathon. You see yourself running from everything, only thinking of yourself.

You become greedy, thinking not about your mortgage, your job, your child's school bill, the repair for your car. You only think about the finish line.

And that's why W6D3 is a major milestone. One that I completed today."	t5_2rgoq	True

1317089982.0	kshnm	I thought I had failed... so I cried... and then pulled myself together!	longtimecompanda	45	4	12	"It was a really long day... I woke up with a cough and had class and a full shift at work... I did not want to run. I walked the warm up, and got 9 min into the dreaded 20 min run until I had to stop. The pain in my side was unbearable. 

I took a breather and cried. I thought for sure I was headed home. I was so mad at myself for not running these last 3 days and I felt like I would never run a 5k.

 I can't explain, but I don't think I have ever felt like such a failure (even though I have done worse in my life... like 21 years of couch potato-ness)

But I decided I couldn't take the shame. I stretched, walked the warm up again and RAN THE ENTIRE 20 MIN!! 

Then I cried again out of joy. I did it! Plus if you count my first 9 min, not a bad run! 

I am so happy and wanted to share. I hate but really actually love you C25k! "	t5_2rgoq	True
1314742678.0	jzigy	Just finished my 5K run!	reebzor	41	0	7	"I'm just in shock right now. 9 weeks ago, I would have laughed in your face if you tried to get me to run anywhere.

I read another post in here talking about not looking at the clock, so I did just that today. When I finally couldn't take it any longer, I glanced down, saw I had run 2.77 miles and my 5K runner app told me my 30 minutes had been up. I began to reach up to the treadmill to begin my cool down walk, when shuffle on my iPhone decided it was time to put on Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. At this moment, I knew I had to go for it. 

I've never felt better about myself than I do right now. I'm so glad I never quit all those times that I wanted to. I just want to say the same thing everyone else does: ""If I can do it, so can you!"" 

Don't give up http://instagr.am/p/LtoOk/

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the support here. It goes without saying that I could not have done this without Reddit's support, and it really means a lot to me. I also wanted to add in here that throughout the program, the only time I was ever unable to complete my run was the one right before this one. I had done the 28 minute runs, and going for my first attempt at 30 minutes, I could barely go 15. I had no idea what happened and I kind of beat myself up about it for the rest of the day. I felt like a failure. Like there was no way I could complete this program, but I owed it to myself to continue giving it my all. It really is a great feeling of accomplishment working this hard and finally getting there.

My advice to anyone going through a tough time with this: There's gonna be bad days, days you might not even finish, don't get hung up on them. Failing one day doesn't mean you are a failure, just get back out there and run!"	t5_2rgoq	True
1374503340.0	1itagp	An asthmatic reborn. [W4D1]	katek8kate	39	2	9	"So last week, I started on the three minute runs for week 3, and they were honestly just pure torture. I couldn't breathe. Now, my asthma is an extremely mild case, so I'm not on any regular breathing medications, just have a rescue inhaler for the very rare times when I have an attack. I honestly thought feeling like you're dying and having lungs on fire and heaving and wheezing was just part of the learning-to-run experience. 

But on Friday, a girl at the gym told me I sounded terrible and asked if I was having an asthma attack. No? I don't think so? Maybe? So I finished my workout and popped down to the cheapo clinic, waited for ages, and talked to a doctor about it. Explained I have really mild asthma and shitty prescription coverage on my insurance, so what could I do that isn't a $50/month daily medication. He suggested taking Bronkaid about an hour before my workout.

Holy shit. Today, the three minute runs were leisurely. The five minute runs were a nice challenge, but I didn't feel like I was dying. After my cool down walk, I said, FUCK IT, I CAN RUN BITCHESSS. And I ran for ten more minutes. Still going to stick to the program after this, but I can't believe it took me three weeks to realize that my asthma was really holding me back!

Please use the sidebar! It is very helpful.

&gt;When everyone first starts running they worry about going as fast as they can.

DO NOT DO THIS.


&gt;Run, walk, jog SLOWLY.

You'll be able to run fast, but not right now. If your on W1D2 don't worry about shaving 14.65 seconds off your last run. You'll start trying to constantly beat your old time and you will get injured.

In order to run fast, you need to run far. To run far you need to run slow. 

qwertyrific

&gt;Along the lines of going slowly, it is important to remember that the C25K program is run for time OR distance. When it says to run 20 minutes or 2 miles, that does not mean you are supposed to be running 2 miles in 20 minutes! You run for 20 minutes, or for however long it takes you to run 2 miles.

&gt;Drink plenty of water, ice after runs. Just don't worry about speed and and just focus on completing the program. I think you'd rather finish it running slow then quitting it early because you ran too much too fast.


&gt;W1 is a bitch, but don't skip it even if you think it's nothing. It is something. 

W4 is hard, but when you hit W5 you'll wonder what in the world happened?

&gt;Buy running socks, don't wear cotton, your feet will thank you! Most running socks have material that wicks away moisture such as sweat.

Go get your feet analyzed, don't buy sneakers at Foot Locker where the employees know more about Jordans than Saucony's.

You can get analyzed for three different gaits, pronator, neutral, and supinator. 

Also when you're paying $100+ for sneakers, and there's a really strict return policy you will run. I don't think you will let yourself plop down money and just say ""Oh well, I tried.""

Running shoe brands include Nike, Asics, Brooks, Saucony, Mizuno, New Balance and others.

!!! Most people's feet are two different sizes! A good running store, will fit both of your feet and give you the correct sneakers with sizes that are different. See if your big box shoe store will do the same for you.

&gt;Run three days a week, don't run two days back to back. You need at least a day to recover.

Also eat food! As you run, you'll lose muscle and you need protein to build it back up stronger and leaner than before!

Bananas, eggs, milk are good food. Soda, cookies, and butter are not.

&gt;Register yourself for a 5K two months after you start. You'll pay ~$35 to run, and you'll make yourself run or otherwise you should've just threw your money into the sewer.

&gt;For summer runners:
Run in the morning or the evenings! I highly recommend NOT running in the hours between 11AM-3PM, just don't. 
although [this article in the NYTimes](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/phys-ed-will-training-in-the-heat-improve-your-performance/) says that heat training can improve your runner from 4-8%.

Don't wear cotton, and layers should be kept to a minimum.

&gt;For winter runners:

Late morning to early afternoon might be the best. You might be working during those hours and probably only run before or after. If it's too cold, I recommend a gym, it's not fun when the sun goes down at 5 PM. 


julieannie
&gt;For the ladies- invest in support. My local shoe store had free bra fittings and they were able to help me with even an odd size. Reducing back strain helped my posture which helped me run without back pain.

If there's anything else, experienced runners, that I forgot about don't hesitate to comment!

1375976966.0	1jymhs	Skipped a week and FINISHED!!! :DDD Still in shock!	shewhodestroys	41	7	7	"I have no clue what was so special about today but...

For the first time in my life I just ran 30mins straight. Whaaaaat?!

I had been stuck on Week 7 for three weeks. THREE WEEKS. Then after I started getting the hang of it I completed two 25 min runs. Then the last time I ran I was 2 mins shy of 25mins. But I thought, ""meh. next time I run I'll start week 8 and start the 28 min run. I've been on week 7 long enough to know I can do it.""

Then as soon as my timer hit 28mins, and my app said my workout was complete, apparently my mind and body said, ""NO. THIS FUCKING ENDS NOW, BITCH! LET'S DO THIS!!! O_O"" 
I swear I think for the first time I got a true taste of the ""runners high"" cause suddenly I felt myself going faster, I was zoned out, and I couldn't feel the pain in my body like I did just minutes ago. Then I hear I reached 30mins and I almost stopped dead in my tracks from pure shock, but my body kept going for another min or so until I felt like my heart was gonna explode.... then I stopped. Lol

I felt amazing. Afterward I felt like screaming to the hills ""ANYTHING IS POSSIBLLLLEEE!!!!"" Hahaha.

I still can't believe it. At the end I may have been slow as hell (still technically didn't run the whole 5k) but fuck it! I am basking in the moment that just a few months ago I was chain smoking, all around unhealthy, and could barely run eight 60 second intervals without feel like I was near death. Hell, most of my life I hated even the THOUGHT of running for any extended period of time.

For the first time in my life I've run 30mins straight, and to top it off: I loved every minute. Officially addicted. Onward and upward! 



I wanna thank everyone on this forum for all the consistent advice and inspiration!!

For those thinking about starting it: DO IT. It's life changing.
For those just starting: KEEP GOING. You will surprise yourself.
For those near/at the peak of it: NEVER QUIT. You're stronger than you think.
For those who finished: RESPECT. This shit was not easy.



New goals:
Run the whole 5k straight. Once I am comfortable with running the whole 5k without stopping, then comes working on speed to hit 5k in under 30mins. THEN onto b210k. And from there who knows! At this point I feel the possibilities are endless. &lt;3

All the encouragement from the people around me, coupled with a little bit of determination, had me finishing at 36:25 having ran every step of the race non-stop. It was an incredible feeling. 

It has taken me about 6 weeks to do the first four weeks of the program, and I have gone from 340lbs to 312lbs (M/6'1). At the beginning of this those small minutes were about my limit. It's amazing what a little hard work can do.

During the second 3 minute walk, I had to pause the timer for a bit and try to stretch out my shins.  That last 5 minute interval was a slog, but I made it.  

Lessons learned (or re-learned) today:

1.) Pushing the pace is probably not a good thing at this point.

2.) I still need to spend more time stretching.

3.) There will be plenty of difficult runs - don't get overconfident, stay humble.

LIES

- just 5 more minutes (repeat 5X)

- if you finish today, you never have to run again

- if you complete the next interval, you never have to exercise ever again

- if it's 3:30 out of 5 minutes, I tell myself ""only 60 more seconds!""

- finish today and I'll buy you that $1000 purse

- finish and you'll get a clothes shopping spree

- finish and you can eat an entire cake

- finish and you can stop this diet immediately

- this is burning 1000 calories, isn't it worth it!? (Haha, not even close!)

- finish today and you will feel an amazing sense of accomplishment

- finish and you can eat back your burned calories

- finish and you can take two days off instead of one (W6D3)

I got fired on Tuesday and I really wasn't expecting it.

I also hadn't ran in two or three weeks.

Since I had copious amounts of free time now I decided that I'd go for a morning run and I'd pick up right where I left off. Normally I run without music or anything but the sound of my own panting and breathing and I figured that it would be a good way to clear my head.

I was wrong... sort of.

It started at the end of the second three-minute run; my manager, my  boss, the two human resources people that were said during the meeting that led up to my dismissal.

""... productivity issues...""

""... not as professional as...""

""... going in another direction...""

Over and over and over again. The chime rang and I started walking, puffing and panting and trying to catch my breath.

""... productivity issues...""

""... not as professional as...""

""... going in another direction...""

I slowed up just a little but kept moving. In the minute and thirty seconds that passed I heard another voice join the chorus... mine:

""... productivity issues...""

""Fuck it, man. You're tired.""

""... not as professional as...""

""We can pick this up tomorrow.""

""... going in another direction...""

""Got fired, huh?""

""... going to have to terminate...""

Yeah, so what?

""... unprofessional...""

""So... stop now, go home, regroup, fill out some apps.""

No.

Fuck you.

""... going in another direction...""

Fuck you.

""Workout complete.""

I was gasping and panting like a dying racehorse (guess I was moving a little faster than I should have been) and ended up almost collapsing into a chain link fence but I did it. I picked up right where I left off and even though I wanted to stop and go back to bed and hide I kept going because I'll be damned if I'm going to let something like the loss of a job keep me down.

I took my time - a solid 3 months - to get through the full C25K schedule (I repeated the early weeks especially), and wanted to cap that by participating in an actual event. It was surprisingly easy. I have been training alone, and running with so many people was quite energizing.

So, that's it, one more C25K graduate! The program gets a lot of the credit for this success: I have never been much of a runner, always came dead last in PE at school, and the very progressive steps of C25K really allow for gentle, gradual conditioning. I even finished in the first third of overall runners as well as in my age group, which is not at all shabby. But the true victory, really, was finishing a nonstop 5k!

Now comes the hard part: staying with it! I have a good routine and I will keep at it, the extra motivation is that by now the health benefits have really started kicking in. More energy so I can keep up with my kids, better sleep, just feeling better overall. It's really worth it!

Each story of success has inspired me and helped to push me farther than I probably would have done if I did not read this section. Hopefully my story of success today will have inspire another person who is currently on Week 2 and perhaps struggling...

For the past couple of weeks I've been feeling the strain of running but once I have finished each day, it's a massive feeling of elation and it's gotten to the point this week where I am actually excited and looking forward to going out running (seriously, on Sunday night I couldn't sleep at all because I just wanted to get out there and start Week 5!)

I did Week 5, Day 3 today and though it was tough towards the end, I managed to bust through it and now I'm totally pumped for Week 6...I just hope I can get some sleep this Sunday night :P"	t5_2rgoq	True

Just wanted to let you know that today was the first morning I woke up super early before work to tackle W5D3. And I did it! With barely any huffing and puffing! 

I'm 20 and never run that long in my entire life.  I suffered from eating disorders in high school and then put on a lot of weight so I've been really insecure lately.  Doing C25k has been amazing (my first bout into healthy exercise) and I want to thank this community for all of the inspiration!

1374500917.0	1it7tw	Done - mostly! Finished week 9 (timed) yesterday, now headed for 5k. Couldn't have gotten this far without you all.	1plus2plus1plus1	37	0	9	"I finished W9D3 yesterday, and though I had dreams at the beginning of getting to the point of actually running 5k in that 30 minutes, I discovered about halfway through the program that I was not going to be fast enough. But I stuck with it and finished each session for time. My goal for the last run was to break 2 miles of pure shuffle-jogging in 30 minutes, and I did it! Yes, I'm that slow (15 min/mi).

For me it feels like a huge victory. I'm mid-30s, been losing weight but still have 20-30lbs to go, and have never been a runner in my life. I'm the one that used to say things like ""there's no reason to run unless being chased by a tiger or zombies, and then you only have to run faster than your slowest friend."" I was never a sports player or athlete, have bad knees, and have a special talent for quitting any sort of fitness routine. In fact, if you asked me now why I started running with C25K, I'm not entirely sure I could pinpoint the reason. It sounded like a good idea at the time. And now, I enjoy running!

Things that I learned here that I think helped make me successful are: get decent shoes, don't worry about pace, don't push yourself too hard, and take your rest days. I spent a lot of time worried about how slow I am, but two things I read here really stuck with me. One was the tried-and-true ""it's a marathon, not a sprint"" that I've applied to other things like weight loss, but that was just as true for me and running. The other was (sorry, I forget who said it) that, in terms of pace, what most people think of as jogging is running, and what most people think of as running is sprinting.

This subreddit has been key in my success. Before I began, I read tons of stuff here. Whenever I had a question, I checked in the search box. I began C25K determined to finish each week on time, to not injure myself, and to take it slow and easy through the program. I succeeded on each of those points. I never failed a session, didn't injure myself, and grandma shuffled my way to 30 minutes of sustained jogging.

My reward for finishing 30 minutes was to sign up for a 5k race in a couple months. Now, I'm going to take those next couple months and work my way up to 5k for real. I doubt I'll get fast enough to do it in 30 minutes, and I honestly don't care if I can right now, this year. My goal is to be able to run 5k without walk breaks or death in under 45 minutes. For the next week or two, I'm just going to keep running 30 minutes, and try to get more comfortable with running that length of time. Then I'm going to incorporate one longer run a week to see if I can start going for more distance. I've seen tons of people say here that the speed with come with time spent running, and I think that sounds like a good plan for me. I know I went from 1.99 miles on W9D2 to 2.02 miles on W9D3, and if I can keep that up a bit, and gain endurance to run for another 10-15 minutes, I'll finish my 5k soon enough!"	t5_2rgoq	True

How lame is that?! If I wanted to walk, I could step out my front door and go for a nice, lovely walk. But then why would I be doing C25K? So today I went out early in a nice cold drizzle and crushed W6D3. I ran for 25 minutes and enjoyed it. I realized that *I like running*. It makes me feel strong and fierce.

1347199100.0	zlnv3	Thanks r/c25k, I'm finally done!	greymatters_flipside	40	5	14	"I'm finally done guys! More than 2 months of running and I didn't even skip a single week, although I skipped some days due to heavy rains but I made sure to make up for it. TBH, I didn't really follow c25k's plan step-by-step but that doesn't mean that this has been a walk in the park for me. 

On my w1d1 I ran for as far as I could(2km) without stopping, walked for 300m more before jogging the rest of my 4.5km route and finished in 34min. I did this for the first 4 weeks in which I gradually shortened my walk breaks until I completely eliminated them by w4d2. Of course, this has posed some problems for me all of which I endured in the first 3 weeks(easing into routine, minor cramps, *painful side stitches*) but I managed to soldier on. 

What I did to avoid those problems were:

* **Set-up multiple phones to ring at 5:30am** Yes, and making sure to be on bed by 10pm. Having a complete nights' rest is key. 

* **Proper cool down is needed** plus stretching *after* your run to prevent cramps. Stretching before running (for me) would more be more likely to cause injuries. Didn't experience cramps after w2 with these.

* **Exhale while landing on your left** I've looked for several tips on preventing *side stitches* after being plagued with this on w3 and this is the only thing I did and it worked! My breathing pattern is like a 1-2-3-exhale, right-left-right-exhale was very conscious of this at first but as I do it regularly it became 2nd nature.

* **Proper hydration before your run** and avoid loading up on food. I just munch a small piece of bread and drink a cup of water before going out.

* **Try to land on the balls of your feet** not on the heels. Landing on your forefoot will distribute the force to your calf muscles. But if you pound your heel every time you jog, the constant pressure might lead to a stress fracture.
 
I didn't have much of a problem when I did these after w5 so I think if these helped me, it'll help most new runners too. 

I finally reached 5km(33min) by w5d3, and it's all uphill from there. I can feel my runs improve week by week and it *feels awesome*. I now look forward to each run and I'm no longer dreading it. My final run yesterday was a 6km in 34min and I was not even exhausted like I was when I started. So guys *don't get discouraged if the start is tough, it will only get better and when it does you'll enjoy running*.

I made this post as a way of *paying it forward* in my gratitude to the posters who encouraged me at the start. Thank you guys! This subreddit has taught me to be more active and I like the person I have become. Time to move on to /r/b210k and /r/running for me.

Sidenote: I'm currently using the [Zombies, Run!](https://www.zombiesrungame.com/) app on my run and it's awesome! It inserts 3x1min sprints in my 30min jog and has a great story. With this, trimming my 5k time would be more fun."	t5_2rgoq	True

I finished the first mile in 8:38 and while I felt a bit tired, I kept going. Fast forward to the second mile and I finish it in 9:13 and was feeling great, for some reason, I felt better than when I finished the first mile, it was probably due to the reason that I slowed down a bit.  Anyways, I kept going and according to the plan I was supposed to stop at 28 Minutes but at that time according to my RunKeeper app, I was at 2.9 Miles; you see when I first started the C25K program, I made a promise to myself that I should be able to run a 5K in under 30 Minutes and be able to do it before college started again. College starts on Tuesday for me and I knew felt that since I was so close to finishing the 5K I should just push for it. So, I kept running and around the 29:30 Minute mark I got to 3.12 Miles. 

When I stopped my run, I was about 30:05 Minutes, 3.18 Miles with an average pace of 9:28 Minutes/Mile. 

I just wanted to run till 30 Minutes, hence the extra .06 Miles. 


This subreddit is great and I am very glad that I found it. I was able to finish my goal and along the way did something that I would not have dreamed possible 2 months ago. Thanks a lot! I will keep running and from now on, I'm going to be running a 5K on each of my running days. I have a lot to improve on, so I'm going to keep running and to anyone to who has just started the program, keep going, it is worth it at the end. 

Thanks for reading and everyone have a great day! :)

What's your excuse?	passwordsdonotmatch	52	16	29	"Tomorrow is the last day of the 8 week program that I started well over 8 weeks ago.  I've been faithfully using the C25k app by zen labs every alternating day since May 8.  But let me tell you about me before I started C25k.

I was 275 lbs.  Both of my knees had been destroyed in high school sports (bilateral ACL, MCL and meniscus repairs followed by months of physical therapy).  I avoided things that I loved (playing basketball and other sports) because I was convinced I would tear up my knees again.  Technically, I could walk for 30 minutes, but not if it was uphill.  I dreaded taking my beagle out because I wasn't able to keep up when he got after rabbits.  I would get out of breath wrangling my pre-k visually impaired students.  Something had to give.

It took several attempts to get through W1D1.  The first few weeks were all hard work.  I got lots of great advice here and from friends who were runners. Throughout the program there have been a million excuses to put off a day or stop in the middle of a workout.  Honestly, I've succumbed to those temptations, but then I felt really shitty.  So to avoid feeling like that, I run.

As of today, I'm down 25 lbs thanks to C25k and changes in my diet.  My beagle can't make it through my runs with me.  When I babysit for my cousin, her kids are always POOPED at the end of the day.  My friends and family are amazed at what I've accomplished.  And of course I'm proud.

So what's your excuse for not running today?

**EDIT** So I wasn't saying there's not a reason for skipping a day.  If you're too sick or hurt or there are other things getting in your way, that's fine.  Just keep at it. There are plenty of obstacles to overcome, so make sure you aren't hiding behind excuses is all I was saying.

1341114363.0	vv5w5	W9D1 - People need to lock up their dogs.	KFCatz	46	13	7	"Maybe a better word would be control their dogs.

First off, I ran about 3.15 miles in 30 minutes. Not baaad! Now for the rant:

I was hungry when I began my run, so my outlook was bleak from the start. Right around mile 2 the dogs (Emme, and Robbie. Aussies) and I got attacked by 2 other dogs(a pointer and a lab), so I had to stop and scare them off before continuing. I'm talking bared teeth, hackles up, the whole deal. 

So here I am desperately trying to restrain my dogs, who were thankfully tied to my waist, while going after the attacking dogs and all the while keeping everyone separate. Some grunting, pssting, stomping, and hand gestures later, I feel comfortable enough to move on. So I'm dragging my dogs, only to see the attacking ones still following. One more bark at them and they scattered. I'm so tired of being attacked. 

Territorial dogs need to be tied up, or restrained. If not for my safety, for the safety of people who can't handle the situation. 

Shortly afterwards I got a cramp, and paused my timer again to breath through it. Then I promptly soared through the last mile with a horrible attitude. This was mainly due to my dogs going ape-shit and running in overdrive mode.

Now I feel like crap and have a fuse that's too short to measure. There's no way I'm taking the dogs with me again. While it was fun these last 3 workouts, I need to find a safer place to run with them.

For the past three weeks I have been running with a run club the 3 mile route and failing miserably. I started the C25K this week and did Day 2 on the route. I also slowed my pace immensely to where I felt like I could breathe comfortably. I felt like I could run forever at the slow pace! It's about building up endurance, your lungs will hit first- so run where you can breathe. Even though my pride was hurt and everyone ran straight past me, I went at least twice as far as I ever had straight running. It was a really great run.

Throughout the nine weeks of doing this I have lost 12 pounds. Just this last week I started changing my diet and I started riding my bicycle to work on my rest days which is 8.6 miles one way. I have a long way to go before I reach my goal weight of 160 pounds,(currently 5' 7"" at 185) but I finally know that I can achieve that without fail.

So what is next? Bridge210k. I start Monday, but  I have a Color Me Rad 5k on June 30th. How should I go about running that without interfering with the B210k program?

KieranJones1	39	3	9	"The grand finale run ended up covering 5.13km in 32:27, according to the Nike app. First I noticed it had been 30 minutes, and I thought about stopping but decided to keep running till I'd covered 5km (of which amount I was just short). Then when I hit 5km, I decided to keep going till my usual ""turn around point"". Even when I hit there, I could've kept going, but wanted to keep as close to 5k as I could so I could proclaim I'd literally gone from Couch to 5k!


It's been quite a journey. Thanks so much to those who frequent this subreddit - your success stories motivated me greatly throughout the programme.

Well, I failed to run 28 minutes.

Because I ran 35 instead. And I even pumped up the mph in the last few minutes, bringing my workout to 2.92 miles which is so damned close to 5k I'm counting it. I no longer need to use the workout reminders on my iPod. I can just... run.

Now I'm starting with new goals of picking up my pace until I can do 5k in under 30 min. 

To anyone just starting out: YOU CAN DO IT. In February I got winded and wrecked by doing week 2. I thought ""5 minutes straight... you're insane."" Yesterday I added 30 minutes to that 5 minutes and when I was done I didn't want to die.

The first part is about my C25K experience and how it changed my life. I hope to inspire some people with it. If you don't want to read my story you should skip over to the ""gear"" part for some practical tips. I hope you enjoy some of it!**

I had never imagined the changes a simple spreadsheet telling me how long I should run on a giving day could make. Those 3 days a week, it all seems so easy now, but when I look back at myself starting out, I remember all the struggles I had.

Damn did I feel bad about myself. Moving out of your parents house is never easy, especially when you do so when you're 15. Fast food, video games, alcohol, you name it, the college-life started early for me.  I was never into sports, I fucking hated exercise. But then the point came where I hated myself more for not exercising.

Around September last year I bought a pair of sneakers. Those poor sneakers laid in my room for way too long because I was scared. Scared to start something very easy. This spreadsheet, telling me how long to run, it scared me, for some reason.

When I moved to a new apartment in January I decided it was time. On the 8th of January I started day 1 of my journey. I didn't have any fancy running clothes so I pulled on a sweater, some comfy pants and my sneakers. Damn was it hard, it was freezing outside and those 1 minute intervals where killing me. I barely finished the 8 minutes that day, but I felt different afterwards. The fact that I kicked a habit felt so great that I looked forward to the next run and low and behold, two days later those same intervals where easier, not much, but just a bit easier. And so I kept on running.

I ran at 6am, I ran at 11pm, I ran through snow, rain and freezing cold. Every time I stepped outside my body wanted to go back in, but my mind pushed me to do it. Slowly running became easier, and the struggles I had on the first week where easy on week 4.

I clearly remember W5D3, that first 20 minute interval. Damn was it scary... A friend of mine who had way more experience running decided to run it with me. He paced and timed me. That bastard however didn't make me stop at 20 minutes, no, when I asked him how long I still needed to run he responded that we were running for 30 minutes already, and did 4,5km. That day westopped at 5k, my first one. And damn did I feel good about it. That rush, that feeling, it was fantastic and suddenly all my struggles felt like they were worth it.

I planned my first 5k event and finished it in 28:08. That's where things really changed. That first event. Running between 1000's of other runners, all being out there with one goal. Finishing 5k. Fat runners, slim runners, fast runners, slow runners, young runners and old runners. Everybody was friendly and we all ran our own little race. I think that day got me addicted.

Another 5k followed slowly afterwards. I crushed my PR to 25:54 and damn did it feel good. That race was hard, I really needed to work for that time, but damn did it feel good stepping over that line knowing that you crushed your PR.

Move forward to today. I'm currently running 4 times a week, around 25 miles every week. I completed a HM in training and training for my first official HM next month. I did two official 10k's (first one in 55:08, second in 47:56) and another 5k event in 24:00 (5k PR is 22:42 from training though).

Running became part of my lifestyle. I feel restless on the days I can't run. Running clears my mind, it really helps keeping my mind happy and organised. My friends see me getting up on 7am on Saturday for runs and call me crazy, but I couldn't be happier. Running is definitely the best thing that happened to me in years, if not my entire life.

And all started with this little spreadsheet, telling me to run for a minute and walk for one, repeating that 8 times. Was it hard? Yes, definitely. Was it worth it in the end? Hell yeah!

To not completely turn this post into an ego-trip I want to give you guys (and girls) some tips that might help to get you out and change your life for the better too:

* **Gear**

Many companies want to make you believe you need to invest 100's of dollars before you can even get out of the door and I agree, those investments can make running easier. But it's definitely not necessary for starters like you guys! Any t-shirt will do, any pants that are comfortable will work and running with a stopwatch is perfectly doable. Don't let missing gear be an excuse to not go out. Reward yourself with the fancy stuff everytime you get to a certain goal. (I for example didn't buy a GPS watch till I got to my first HM).

* **Shoes**

Shoes however, can make or break your experience. I ran on some cheap Asics my first weeks but I recommend investing in a pair that's fitted to your feet as soon as possible. Don't run on flat and fancy sneakers. Those are only made to look good but will seriously hurt your feet. I own those as regular shoes and till today my feet hurt if I run a bit in them. Shoes are the only necessary running investment in my opinion, prepare to drop some cash on them, you will love them for many miles to come if you buy the right ones. Don't feel scared to go into a running shop because you're too fat, lazy, slow, inexperienced or whatever. Those guys are happy to help and started insecure and inexperienced at some point too. A good shop will have advice for every kind of runner.

* **Pain**

Oh damn the pains. You start out on your run and there it is, that little spot on your legs that hurts, your toes are itching or your knee feels a bit weird. Well get used to it! Every run I have those little pains that annoy me, but they will seldom really hurt you. Stop however if they get a lot worse during your run or the pain feels like a knife/needle every step you take. If you want to stop every time it hurts a bit you're not going to get far. No pain, no gain! I know it's very scary the first times you feel pain, but sometimes you just have to run through it. Don't overdo it though, sometimes, when it **really** hurts you should just stop, take some extra rest and try again later. Nothing wrong with that!

* **Experiment**

Big thing, there are so many different runners that all prefer other things. You're wondering if you will run better in the morning instead of in the evening? Well try it, maybe it sucks, maybe it's great. You can ask 1000 runners what they prefer, and all will answer different. Find your own answers. The same is for the questions ""when should I eat"", ""what should I wear"", ""should I drink before a run"" etc. Try new stuff, but not too much at the same time. If you want to know what variable X will do with your run then change it a few times. You will know soon enough what works for you.

* **Speed**

Easy one, **DON'T WORRY ABOUT SPEED YET**. Finish C25K first, then worry about speed.  You're not too slow. The only ""too slow"" is on the couch. I can't repeat it enough, speed is for people that can comfortably run 5k, not for starters. I still don't worry about my speed, some runs I feel great and I go faster then others, but I never look at my results afterwards and feel bad because I went ""too slow"". Again, DON'T WORRY ABOUT SPEED, it will improve over time automatically.

* **What will that person think about me?**

It doesn't matter, really it doesn't. It's your life, and you're going to change it for the better. Those experienced runners you cross on your runs aren't going to judge you, they all started the same. Those people that look at you while you run? Fuck, you don't even know them why would you care? You feel bad about the fact you don't run, so change it. If somebody yells something stupid at you it will suck, but nothing sucks more then being unhappy about yourself. As soon as you get home after another great accomplishment you will forget those stupid people. (I got yelled at many times in my bad neighborhood but I stopped to give a shit, it's my life and I fucking enjoy it!). For the fat runners I would like to add, those people that judge you for running will also judge you if you're out not running. They are just assholes and you're not going to change that. You can however change your obesity! I dropped 25 pounds in the progress, you can do it too! I have huge respect for everybody that's obese and starts changing that. Being obese and doing nothing about it, like my ""pizza-for-breakfast"" roommate, is weak in my opinion though.

* **But! What if? How should I?**

Got any extra questions? Feel free to ask, I have been at your position too, I know how it feels. Feel free to ask, I will be happy to help!

Starting around W4, I suffered from terrible side stitches, and had to stop running a few times because of the pain. Some nice people here gave me advice, as did a few of my other runner friends. On W7 now, and doing great. I occasionally feel a twinge, but nothing like before. Here's what really helped me:



* Drinking lots of water throughout the day and stopping about an hour before my workout.

* Belly breathing and pushing the air out through pursed lips while exhaling, like I'm blowing out a candle

* And the biggest one: POSTURE! Not slouching or leaning forward while running, but keeping shoulders back and relaxed, chin up, back straight. 



I've also heard that working on your core strength (of which I have very little) can help. I've been doing more sit ups and yoga in the last couple of weeks, but probably not enough so far to make a difference. I don't think it will hurt in the long run though. 



I hope this helps somebody else out. Good luck to you all!

I did the 5 minute warm up and then went into running &amp; was blown away when runkeeper told me it had been 20 minutes and my C25K app vibrated when I completed the run. I couldn't believe how fast the time went and how easy it was (I did hit a bad side stitch that I pushed through &amp; it did eventually go away). I went running on a new trail tonight that was 2 miles long and I knew I wanted to run the full 2 miles so after I cheered that I ran the full 20 minutes straight I kept running until I hit the 2 miles. I felt so good that I kept running and ran another half a mile to a local park and then turned around ran the whole 2.5 miles back to my car - I couldn't stop running it felt so good.

1339771927.0	v3ho3	A few days ago I finished my last C25K run. There's a couple of things I want to share.	Azelius	42	5	6	"Wow.

What a long, strange trip it has been. And I say long because the first time I started the C25K program was way back in August of 2011. I was stressed with Med school exams, and I decided to run.

I still remember that first day in the park, how badly my legs itched and how silly and out of shape I felt. I was living alone at that time with a housemate, and I loved starting to run. It was fun. I had never been an athletic person. Hell, in High school, I was the shunned, ostracized nerdy kid. You can begin to imagine the self-esteem nightmare that those types of experiences cause.

Still, my happiness with running was short lived. After a few good runs of week 1 and 2, including my first run with rain, I finished my med school exams. I did not do well. I had to repeat the year. I was dismayed, had to move back in with my mom and left my running shoes at the door.

That was a year ago.

It's been a long year. I was preoccupied with my studies, and trying to find myself again. I didn't even consider running again. Sure, I had the sporadic run or two according to my Nike+ records, but that's it.

Until I started my exams in May. Maybe it was the stress, maybe I just couldn't deal with everything anymore. Whatever the reason, I started running again.

Week two was painful to restart. Those first few weeks were painful. Getting completely winded after running only 4 or 5 minutes. Ideas of inadequacy and not being ""enough"" having at the back of my head. And still, something awesome happened. Each day, each week, I started looking forward to my runs.

I used to hate getting sweaty and wet. But every day that passed, I looked forward to that feeling, of being completely winded, tired, sweaty and happy. And each day I saw myself running more, better, farther.

The first time I ran 10 minutes I couldn't believe it. Imagine my face when I did the same with 20 minutes. I was elated. How could this scrawny, awkward person be able to accomplish such a feat?

And eventually I realized. I realized why I loved running. I realized why I never gave up, and stayed the course till the end. I wasn't running away like I used to. I wasn't trying to protect myself or hide. **I was chasing everything I ever wanted.** I was suffering for it. And I was reaching it. And I wasn't a scrawny, awkward teenager. I was me, and athletic young man in his 20's lapping everyone that was staying home on their couches.

And still, my problems didn't go away. Everything around me kept getting more complicated. More responsibility, more problems, more hardships. But when I go out running, it's only me, my songs and the track. Some day's you get big revelations, flashes of truth and motivation while you're out there. But most it's just the silence of feet against pavement and the soundtrack of your choice. Nothing more.

Running won't get rid of your problems. No matter how far you run or how fast, they'll be there when you get back and leave your shoes at the door. But it will give you the confidence, the power you need to face them. Maybe it's because running serves as a sort of mirror, that reminds you just how damn strong you are. Or maybe it's the runners high. Or the knowledge that each week, you can improve, become better. Whatever it may be, the effect is the same. **It reinforces you.**

As for me, I'm convinced running will stay a part of my life, and of who I am, for a long time. I plan on entering my first race next month, and I'm sure there'll be many more after that. I look forward to my first half-marathon, my first marathon and many other things. But above all, I look forward to the happiness I know running will bring me.

I write this because I've been meaning to share this for some time, and I know many of you run for similar reasons and feel similar things. I hope that for those of you that are starting, my words can serve as motivation. And for those near the finish line, that you may continue until you cross it, and beyond.

TL;DR: **It's worth it.**

p.s [Here's](http://nikeplus.nike.com/plus/activity/running/Azelius/detail/102942400) my last run of the C25K program for proof/archive.

1338239708.0	u998b	Though only at W4D2... I blew myself away by finishing my first official 5k. (Pic inside) 	del_ktm_msp	38	2	11	"Let me explain.... I scheduled this 5k race about 7 weeks ago. I wanted to give myself a deadline, and presuming I had kept up with the running plan, I'd be in Week 7 and could do the 5k comfortably. In reality, I am at W4D2, but am getting more consistent and am feeling much better about my strides, breathing and running habit. 

I am going to just continue the C25K plan till I complete it..... 

The race was magnificent. As I learned from the comments here, I didnt try anything new today. Same shoes. Same patterns. Same pace. Since I'm on W4 in the c25k plan, I generally kept my jogging intervals to 5 minutes (when I could). The interval training of the plan really helped me keep switching between walking and jogging....

It wasn't easy, but ""I am going to do this"", I told myself. Each step I took was taking me a step closer to the finish line. If you move forward, you'll move forward.

1334751753.0	sfw5p	W1D1 Finished!	GDKern	41	3	6	"I have to say, the hardest part about this was actually getting out there and getting motivated to run. I'm a senior in high school and was always really skinny (6'2"" and 145 lbs) but have gotten more and more out of shape over the past few years. Now I'm up to 185 and wanting to get fit again. Found this program, and I love it. This morning I woke up long before my alarm went off, and as I lay in bed I started having an internal argument with myself. Started thinking I wasn't gonna bother doing it today. It can wait. I don't feel like it. Then I remembered all the stories you guys posted here, all of your successes, and it motivated me. I just finished my run and I feel fantastic! Can't wait to keep going with this!"	t5_2rgoq	True
1332414372.0	r87qh	Master of Excuses retiring as of W2D1	healthy-ish	40	4	24	"So I just got back from my first run of week 2. Before I left my house I started hearing a faint voice in the back of my mind weakly suggesting reasons to not go running today: ""It's rainy,"" ""Your legs look jiggly in those pants you're wearing,"" ""You just ate half a peanut butter sandwich, you'll get a cramp."" I shrugged all of those off and hit the sidewalk. As I got into it though, I realized that this week was harder than last week (surprise!) Then that voice came back: ""Just go home when you get to the street that goes back into your neighborhood, you're not gonna keep this up anyway."" BAM!
This thought scared me, a lot. I started thinking about all the excuses I make on a daily basis and how those affect not just my health but my success in school, at work, and in my relationships. I started this whole thing to make my life better, and listening to the excuses I make up in my own head is the root of a lot of the problems I want to fix.
So, for the rest of my run (which I finished by the way) I made a list of all the reasons I am doing C25K. 

TL;DR Don't listen to the excuses in your head, make a list of reasons. Here are some of mine, feel free to add your own:

*to look better in my yoga pants

*to find a healthy weight

*to get out of my house and into nature

*to make everybody's jaw drop when I get back from study abroad

*to sleep better

1329920381.0	q0wrw	The Most Amazing thing just happened!	xacto	40	5	3	I recently quit smoking after almost 15 years and decided to start the c25k program.  Two days ago, on W5D3, I got to the two mile point, which was supposed to be the end of my workout, and just kept going.  I actually made it to 3.11 miles.  I did it!  Today I finished my second 5k in a row.  This program is great if you sitick with it and push yourself.

1329867372.0	q01zb	I swallowed a fly, got chased by a dog, and I still finished strong!	Attycakes	43	4	14	"I almost didn't go out today for some silly reason (aka laziness), but I got out there and the second I did I knew it was the right thing.

There's a family of stray cats that live in my apartment complex's neighborhood and every day at six o'clock a calico kitten sits at the gates and watches the car go by. All last week she was watching me run back and forth and today when I was coming back towards my house, she had crossed the street to say hi. I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship...

Not even two minutes after, I was chased by some guy's crazy dog while I was in the run stage. I should have probably stopped so the owner could catch up... but I didn't... I was determined, okay? The dog gave up when he saw I wasn't turning around anyways and ran back to his owner.

I though that was enough... and then the fly happened. I was concentrating on my breathing and- GULP!! Ughhhh, I can still feel it flying in and hitting my tongue. Blech!

My calves were killing me the whole time but **I DID IT!!!**
I got this. After everything that happened today, there's no way I'm giving up. I didn't swallow that fly for nothing, damnit!"	t5_2rgoq	True
1328570970.0	pdtf0	I actually did it c25kers.  Something I never thought possible! Thank all of you! 	transgressor	42	9	19	"There you have it, I just finished w9d3 in spectacular fashion!  I felt great the whole run and finished strong! 

Believe me if you are questioning your ability to complete this program just trust in yourself, if I can do this, **anyone** can do this. 

Here's a little bit about how I got here:

This all started at the beginning of October.  I went to the health center at my uni for a check up, and of course had to face the dreaded scale.  I knew this was going to be bad, but in the end its why I am where I am now.  I tipped the scale at about 345, and needless to say I was pretty god damn ashamed of myself.  As is with a lot of us on here,  I was a very active person in high school, and a pretty successful athlete.  I have always been a big kid, but I was in pretty damn good shape when I was involved in sports.  After a few shoulder surgeries, I decided I wasn't going to pursue athletics into college, and that's when the fluff began to accumulate.  Binging, emotional eating, late night pillaging, you name it, I did it.  It's funny, I hit a point where I was actually *proud* of myself if I only ordered one double quarter pounder from Death Donalds.  Shameful. 

After the weigh in, I decided enough was enough.  I had caught on to r/loseit, r/c25k, and r/keto before I actually started trying to improve my health, so I knew I had a pretty cool pool of information to guide me on my way.  I decided I needed to fix my diet first, so that's when I started some serious portion control, as well as a mostly paleo diet.  It worked well, and I lost about 20 pounds in barely 2 weeks.  I was very excited, but I knew I could do better so I started exercising and a more keto type diet. 

Bring on the c25k!  I was not at all really excited to start this, and figured it wouldn't last, but boy was I wrong.  I got through week 1 without a hitch, so I was riding pretty high.  The first few runs I was really pushing my limits, running from 6-8mph at a given time.  Then those lovely 3-5 minute runs rolled around, and I was pretty sure I was bound to fail one here or there.  Through some good music and focus, I was able to get my head in the right place and push through.  I kept telling myself before runs, ""get your mind right"", ""the only thing that can stop me is me"".  This was so crucial to keep things together.  I went on vacation in the middle of the program, and w5d3 fell during this time.  I felt good for keeping up with in even on vaca, but this was by far the biggest hurdle of my journey.  It started out by me not even reading the running plan and assuming it was just like w5d2.  That was the most horrible feeling when I checked my phone and realized I was 5 minutes in to a 20 minute run.  I kept my head up, slowed my pace a bit, and was able to push through it.  At that point I knew nothing was going to stop me.  Its really important to keep your focus throughout this, and if you hit a day where your body isn't feeling normal, take an extra rest day. There is no shame in that and your body will perform much better when you eventually run again.  I was lucky enough to be injury free throughout, and never failed one level.  I took extra rest when I thought I needed it, and backed off on the intensity at times because I knew keeping with it and not giving up was more important than distance or pace.  

Thank everyone here and everyone at r/loseit r/keto for everything.  I am sitting at 286 right now, so 59lbs down from that dreadful weigh in on October 16th.  I am doing everything possible to be at 100 pounds lost by May 1st, wish me luck!  

Keep it up everyone, you are all amazing and huge inspiration to me!  "	t5_2rgoq	True
1328258541.0	p91up	Just wanted to pop back in and thank the community. (tl;dr: read the post).		42	6	5	"Hi guys

Last year I first ventured to this subreddit after seeing a loseit post of some fat guy becoming a handsome devil. He adviced C25K as a start for doing cardio and to get in shape. I figured if he could do it, so could I.

I already had good running shoes and I added to my collection with a bunch of running thights, tech shirts and some fancy headphones.

I started W1D1 and I had near instant spleen cramps. I still blame dehydration for that. 

I fought through the first 2 weeks, but I started picking up speed. After some advice about pacing I found my way. I picked out a pace that works for me (5 min/KM). Some might think this is very fast for a beginner, but it worked for me, I could keep this pace throughout the program.

I followed the time program, not the distance program, and in W5D3 I graduated with a 5K run in under 30 minutes.

I broke down with a knee injury, and had to stop running for a while. When I recovered I picked back up in W5D1 and I kept going. After a while I stopped using the C25K app and just ran until I was tired. 

Yesterday I ran a new record, 12K in 55 minutes, I was elated! My knee is still a bit sore, but according to the sports physician I'm seeing it's nothing to worry about, it's just my knees getting used to longer distances.

During C25K (and Keto-diet at the same time) I dropped 26lbs and I'm officially not overweight anymore, by BMI standard, and by belly size (sub 102 cm). 

**With this my life changed, and I thank the community here for it. C25K is a golden method to get in shape and I try to advise it to everyone I meet.**

After graduation I started a running program in my company and try to organise a biweekly 5K for my employees. Also I'm doing a C25K from start with 2 very much overweight colleagues. It costs me three hours a week, but it's so worth it to see their lives improve. (After they finish I usually add a 10K for myself these days).

I could keep writing but I doubt people would want to keep reading. I just want to give you all my personal protip:
 
**Keep hydrated during the day, and do not drink large amounts of water just before or during a run, you'll slosh like a beast.**

I started this program 6 weeks ago after a lifetime of no physical activity what so ever. I'm a software engineer, and have been since I dropped out of school at 17 years old. Gym class was the last time I was in physical activity, and I know I used to hate gym class back then. The end result of this attitude towards physical health, of course, left me with a rotten body weighing in at 117 kg (258 lbs) when I started dieting in January. I'm 178 cm long (5""8') and 31 years old, no time to start undoing a lifetime of bad behavior like the present.

Week 1 was brutal, the whole week. My legs were cramping up for the last few runs of every session, I struggled to get enough oxygen (asthma combined with my rotten shape). Week 2 was slightly better, but I didn't dare look forward and think about what was in store the coming weeks - all though I knew.

Week 3, day 1, was when it clicked for me. My legs were now able to do as I commanded, and I had started getting control over my breath. While still getting horribly exhausted on some of the runs, it now felt like a mental thing more than a physical thing. Things have been going along steadily since then - some ups, some downs, but I've completed every run so far. A few without really getting tired, a few where the last running interval were done on pure willpower getting no help from the rest of my body.

A few days ago I more or less crashed. I woke up almost shaking, having absolutely no energy. W5D2 was brutal, those 8 minutes are the heaviest mental struggle I've had so far. I noticed a couple of minutes into the first run that this was going to be a struggle. I started looking at my food intake when I got back, and realized that I was eating way too little for my exercise level. I work out 6 days a week now (lifting weights on my off-days from running), and completely empty myself out every day. Yet I was eating roughly the same amount of calories I was eating when I was just dieting without exercising. Yesterday I stuffed my face with food of all sorts just to give my body something to work on (maybe a good idea, maybe a bad idea, I didn't even bother checking it up). It felt like things were starting to kick back into gear yesterday afternoon, but I was very apprehensive about W5D3 coming up today. D2 was such a struggle, and not knowing what my body would feel like once I started using it today, I feared I wouldn't be able to complete a day of the program for the first time.

I set off in moderate wind and light rain this morning. Wind blowing in my face, making running heavier than usual, but my body responded unusually well. A few minutes into the run, I passed a farm down the road here. I remembered something I hadn't thought of since W1D1; being able to run from home to that farm was going to be a milestone for me. If I could do that some day, and that would be huge. I've ran that distance a couple of times so far in the program, but I didn't remember that goal I set myself until today. It gave me tons of motivation, and I ended up completing my 20 minute run (with a few minutes uphill running at 10 and 15 minutes) feeling like I just got started. I felt so great when Lara in the NHS C25K podcast told me I had finished my run that I just couldn't make myself stop. I took a little detour from my regular route and ran via another neighboring farm (yes, I live in the country side, tons of farms!) all the way home. I threw myself on the grass when I came home and just savored the moment for a little while before doing my 5 minute cooldown walk.

I've always told myself I could do this, ever since I started, and that there is no half assed way to do this and still get anything out of it. But part of me wasn't sure I could run longer periods than those short intervals I've had so far. Now I know I can, and W6D3 can't come fast enough. I forgot to start Endomondo when I started the run today, but based on earlier runs on the same route I'm guessing I came in at around 4.2 km distance-wise today, where 3.5+km was from running. Still some way to go before I can do a full 5k in 30 minutes, but I'll get there. From now on, it's not about ""how"", just ""when"".

This ended up being a far longer post than I had thought it would be, but I'd just like to thank everyone posting in this subreddit about their progress and struggles. It's really motivating to see people like me that have no business at all running, actually doing it and doing it well.

Now I'm going on a little fishing trip for a few days. It's going to be great with some new sceneries to run in with my new found motivation."	t5_2rgoq	True
