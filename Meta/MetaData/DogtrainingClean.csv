1357934660.0	16e9zx	"Tip: The MOST valuable thing I've ever taught my dog was ""Look at me!"""	whirlingderv	175	22	54	"I saw the suggestion to teach your dog ""Look at me!"" in a comment on a post on here about recall. I taught my dog the command in one 45-minute walk. Saying ""look at me"" just randomly at first, then giving him a high value treat when he did. I didn't make him come to me, I brought the treat to him to make it as easy as possible. I gradually worked up to doing it more often when he was intently sniffing something, or was otherwise highly distracted from paying attention to me.

The benefits have been twofold: one, he pays way more attention to me on walks, often just looking up at me attentively, something he never did before the new command. The second benefit is so great that it is unbelievable... his recall is pretty good, but he *is* pitbull and beagle, so it is sometimes hard to compete with his determination, especially when he is on the scent of some small mammal... now, I shout to him ""look at me!"" which is a much easier command for him to obey, then I hold my hand out to the side, as I usually do when I'm offering a treat, then I ask him to ""come"" and it has been working so much better. 

When he's really obsessing about a scent at the dog park, for example, it is very hard for him to make the decision to stop the sniffing and come to me, and I think that often, the treat and praise just isn't worth it to him when he thinks he might be hot on the trail of something great to chase, but it is a *lot* easier for him to decide to just pause for a second to look at me (thinking that he's guaranteed a treat just for doing that super simple task), then he sees my hand out, hears me yell ""come"" and usually, the spell of the scent is broken and he's already distracted enough from it to come to me when he ordinarily would have ignored me!

**TL;DR** Teach your dog ""Look at me!"" because if you can get him to pause what he is doing for just a second, it is often enough time to redirect him without him realizing that he's having to stop the other behavior that he is enjoying so much."	t5_2r067	True
1370069812.0	1fgcyl	Put my dog down tonight after over 2 years of training	Devlik	170	24	34	"To night we had to put down Roscoe. My wife and I are deeply saddened as you can imagine. We have always had the same bright line that if our dogs cross that had to be the end. Tonight Roscoe crossed that line and bit someone in the face without warning or provocation. We were very lucky that the person got away with very minor scratches and that his eyes were missed. This situation could have been very ugly had it been a child or someone who was not as dog savvy. 

For those that have followed our work with him will know he was a rescue dog with severe neurological issues and behavioral issues that we have been working to counter for the past two years. He had major socialization issues due to being in a kennel for the first three years of his life and had never fully recovered. He was a 100lb american bulldog that was very powerful and could be very dangerous if the wheels fell off and as such anything even remotely like what happened this evening had to be taken with decisive action. Please understand this is not something we did lightly but these are the risks when you adopt a challenging dog. He had two very good years of pot roasts, wooden spoons, steak, and bones falling from the sky twice a day.

I loved him very much, I feel nothing but regret that I was unable to help him adapt fully to a world without cages and hope he can finally find the peace that he so desperately deserves.

I am sorry buddy, you deserved far better by far more.

I work with shelter dogs and do counter conditioning and behavioral remediation all the time. Even with your best efforts you lose dogs from time to time. This one hurts more then the others, I feel like I failed him and its going to take some time to put it right.

Please forgive the nature of this post, it just helped to have a place to put it where others that work with these kinds of dogs would understand."	t5_2r067	True

1371672757.0	1gof0l	This is exactly why leash laws exist. A slight rant.	AsmaClementine	123	11	99	"I'm totally flabbergasted by what happened to me this morning...

I was walking my dog near the local college this morning, as I usually do. We were actually headed back towards home, and cutting through a large parking lot when a little dog comes shooting out of a house, runs across the busy street, dodging cars and comes hauling ass up to me and my dog. Lucy's hackles went up and I grabbed her by the collar (she was already on a leash) before the dog got to us. He starts snapping at her and barking, while Lucy tries desperately to get to him. The lady owner is standing in her doorway watching at this point. I yelled to her to come get her dog.

She jogged across the road fast enough but by this point Lucy is flailing around, I'm desperately trying to keep separation between her and the little shit as he continues to bark and snap at us. Upon getting to me she yells in my face to pick up my dog. Um. I've got a thoroughly tangled, flailing, heavy dog and she has an unleashed 1 pound yapper. It would actually make the situation worse if I attempted to lift my dog in the air. I tell her, calmly at this point, that I have my dog by the collar and that she just needs to grab her dog. She then screams ""Can't you just leave!?"" Again...um. I would love to. Your unleashed dog is currently following my dog everywhere she moves and refusing to stop trying to snap at us.

After yelling and arguing with me she finally picks her dog up (by the collar no less!!). She then starts with the finger poking. Saying that if I know my dog is aggressive, which it clearly is, she needs to be muzzled at all times and that she's calling animal control to report me!! I may have yelled a bit at this point.

So...yeah. I called the non-emergency number the second I got home. Low and behold the lady laughed and said she had, in fact, received a complaint about my dog. She told me exactly what she told the lady...if your dog isn't leashed it's automatically your fault. I had control of my animal, by law, and she did not. I asked her about the muzzle statement and she told me that since my dog has never bitten a human, or a dog she isn't considered aggressive and that I am not legally required to muzzle her at all.

Trust me...I'm mad right now, but I think this really drives home the importance of leash laws. If my dog had (god forbid!) actually hurt that dog, she would still be s.o.l. because he wasn't on a leash. Not to mention the little bastard could have so easily been hit by a car. Leash laws are intended to protect you and your animal!!  

Okay, rant done.  Does anyone have any advice on how I could have perhaps handled the situation better?  

Sigh...now I'm wondering if I shouldn't walk my dog around the college anymore..."	t5_2r067	True

Minna93	109	13	26	"Basically, in the beginning of each month a new trick challange would be announced and in the end of each month there would be a thread where people link videos of their dogs doing said tricks.

I suppose rather simple/basic tricks would be best so that everyone can patricipate. Would you guys be up for it?

1346763938.0	zc0q1	A Reminder:  Be Kind to Other Humans too. Help Keep this Forum Pleasant!	llieaay	91	8	10	"Dear /r/DogTraining, 

We know that you love dogs. We know that you have opinions about the right and wrong way to treat dogs. We do too. That's why we are all here. We'd like to talk about how some of you treat other people. There has been some hissiness and it's making the subreddit occasionally a stressful or unwelcoming place to be. 

* **Try to find and acknowledge common ground and then outline what your disagreements are and why - without being insulting**.  However wrongheaded the advice is that you are responding to is - it probably was posted with the intent of helping people and dogs. 

* You are welcome to appeal to &amp; quote the authorities - but this is an internet forum, you don't need your PhD to join the conversation. You don't even need to be who you say you are.  You just need an internet connection. Unless someone is claiming to be Pat McConnell, who they are is not really at issue.

* If you are new to dog training, your questions and experiences are welcome but please read through the sidebar before adding advice. 

* Bad advice happens, welcome to the internet. If you believe a comment or post violates the subreddit rules report it and the mods will consider removing it. Otherwise, you are welcome to explain why your advice is better - but please don't personally attack the poster.

* Misguided dog guardians happen. People ask for advice because they want to change - attacking them for asking a question is like punishing a dog for returning to you (after running away.) A lot of excellent trainers started out following the worst advice, let's **forgive people their past sins** and focus on helping them do better.

* Let's **make an effort to think the best of people**. Consider that there might not be some coordinated block of downvoters after you, that people who disagree with you often might just disagree with you often and **are not necessarily out to get you specifically**.

We love the community that's growing here - but let's keep it positive for humans too. If you feel yourself getting snarky, log off and go snuggle a pooch. 

We have said before that we don't want to be the polite-police, but if that's what it takes to make this a pleasant forum we will.

Happy training,

1360011781.0	17vz6f	We are so,so sad and looking for advice about the next step with our aggressive 9-month old puppy: Part 2	sacheltry	71	1	10	"For all of you who were so supportive and had asked, I thought I would follow up on what has happened and also hope to give some people a cautionary tale. I will lay out the basic story and try to answer specifics where and when I can. 

Read here for the [background](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/16qeah/we_are_soso_sad_and_looking_for_advice_about_the/ ) of where we where a few weeks ago.  In short, we thought our sweet puppy was getting too aggressive and after looking to another trainer (our third one) and showing him a video of two incidents, he said that we needed to get her to a better place for the safety of the family.

We were all extremely upset at the thought of giving up our eight-month-old puppy. We knew that she was sweet but we were doing something wrong. Turns out we were doing many things wrong, but that we were told to do such things (not that that absolves of what happened). Since both my wife and I have owned dogs previously we thought we had a basic understanding of how to raise a dog. Maybe that is true, but it certainly didn’t prepare us for raising a puppy. Knowing that, I got many books, watched videos and tried to learn as much as I could before getting our puppy. Our kids were also in on the self-training. They too took books from the library and attempted to learned a lot as well.
 
We started to notice that our puppy had some aggressive tendencies, nothing too terrible, but enough that it was a bit of concern. Here are some links to previous postings of mine [link1](
http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/xl1u4/puppy_seems_to_have_a_mr_hyde_lurking_and_is/)
[link2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/wqq0r/is_the_biting_and_nipping_normal_for_my_puppy_it/)

Reading Dr. Dunbar and others wasn’t helping too much. Multiple friends recommended a local dog trainer, who has his own shop. We met with him and were very happy with what he was saying and how he handled our dog. We continued to have lessons and he was the one who installed the invisible fence (I know the feelings about those fences and their collars here, I hope to explain later on). There were a couple of things that seemed not to match what I was reading, but I figured he was highly recommended and had experience in this, I did not.

Teaching our puppy to heel wasn’t going as well as I had hoped. Our trainer brought over a plastic pinch collar that seemed to not be so terrible. Our puppy reacted well with it and teaching her to heel went much smoother. However, watching Dr. Dunbar’s video and learning from other materials, I never saw them use a pinch collar. So that was an issue for me, but still she was doing OK even though there were some aggression (really puppy play) things happening that we weren’t thrilled about. This trainer gave us some advice about this, mostly to correct her with the pinch collar on. That means, when she comes at us, pull the leash sharply so she really feels it and then learns to stop that behavior (it didn’t work).  

So now the trainer is starting group class and we are excited. We figure the more socialization the better and the more training experience we get, the better for all of us. The first class went well and no issues — then came the second class. We were told to bring the shock collar to the class. I thought this was strange and unnecessary, but I’m trying to do whatever I can to make this better.

At the second class we had the shock collar on her and a 30 foot leash. The idea is to work on ‘Come’. We call her and she starts to get a mild shock. The goal is for her to learn how to stop the pain by listening to us. So when she comes to us, the shocking stops. (It is painful to write this and I was horrified by it. Maybe I had a case of Stockholm Syndrome to allow this to happen.) After about 15 minutes of this, our sweet puppy was a quivering mess. I asked him if this was typical. He said yes, but they learn fast this way and she’ll be OK. My wife didn’t get to witness this but I told her all about it in gory detail saying this was very, very wrong and I don’t know what to do.  

We decided that since her aggression and now resource guarding was getting worse and not better, we needed to call someone else. We got some recommendations from trusted friends, who themselves have dogs, checked out his credentials (not something I did with the first trainer) and asked him to come over and evaluate our situation.

The second trainer seemed very knowledgeable and caring. He was also surprised by what he saw. He was expecting to see a cowering, nasty dog that would be growling and snapping at him, instead he saw a very happy puppy come running up to him at the door, excited, licking and going on her back to get a belly rub.
He gave us some things to do such as focusing tasks by having the puppy stand on an apple box. He also was surprised how fast she took to that. Within about 3-5 attempts she would sit on the apple box waiting for the next command. He also told us to keep her on leash 100% of the time (we were doing that, but maybe we were at 90%). So we did that and things didn’t seem that much better, but we didn’t expect results overnight. Then the video happened. (see the [previous post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/16qeah/we_are_soso_sad_and_looking_for_advice_about_the/ )  for the details.

Having since watched the video again, with a slightly more objective view, I see what we were doing wrong — even the first trainer mention it. Why am I still talking to the first trainer you ask? Well through a series of my wife’s friends, he saw it and called me. For weeks I wanted more timely responses from him and *now* I finally get it. In the video (which I will not post partly because of embarrassment but also I don’t need my family broadcast on the internet) my daughter is almost in the dog’s face with her phone and my son is continually tugging on her metal pinch collar to get her to stop. This is what my son was taught: if you want to stop the dog from doing something, you correct her by a quick-sharp tug on her leash. It was just terrible and it even hurts to write about it now. I dare say they were (not on purpose) torturing the dog and that I was most likely doing the same. 

So it became this vicious cycle, the dog would do something undesirable and we would “correct” her my giving her pain - why did I not see this earlier?

We show the video to the second trainer and at that point he said for our safety to have her placed somewhere else. This was too painful to bear. I guess if we really thought something was truly wrong with her, that she was really hardwired incorrectly, we could have done that, but we knew that this couldn’t be the case. I guess dogs can be schizophrenic (I really have no idea) but this didn’t feel right.

I call the rescue people that we got her from and explain the situation in long and emotional detail, she too saw the video. She said that that despite this horrible video she doesn’t think we are terrible people or doing this sort of thing all the time. She felt that we were given tons of bad advice and while they would be take the dog back and place her in a good home, she has a trainer that she trusts and feels could really help the situation. I say we are willing to try it.

So the newest trainer (number 3 if you don’t include the local pet francise store training) and I speak. She reassures me that this is a fixable situation and she wants to meet the family. She also mentioned that corrections with a pinch collar or shock collor done with a dog that has an aggressive tendency  is the opposite of what we should do. That it will in fact make them more aggressive. So before she even comes over I toss the pinch collar and get a Martingale. 

She comes over and meets our puppy who of course is sweet and loving with her. She is in love with our puppy and asks in great detail about what has been happening. She tells us that she is proud of us for not giving up and feels confident that we can get our puppy back to where we all want to be. Compared to the other trainers that we’ve been through, there is a much deeper and broader level of knowledge from her. She explains in detail what we’ve done, should stop doing and should start doing. It was customized to the family and of course our puppy. Some of the amazing things she said (that in the back of my mind I was expecting from the other trainers) was that at some point we are going to teach the puppy, “drop it”, “leave it”, “get your toy” (that one especially to redirect her when she comes after us instead of going after the toy we were playing with). Also she added hand signals to our commands and said that she would send all of these instructions (which I was taking notes on) in an email a few days later, which she of course did (no one else gave us such detailed advice and followed up on it).

So two weeks have passed and we have even had our second meeting with her. What a difference! From a puppy we were told to get rid of, is now a situation where, while it is still not perfect is so much better! The commands, the proper redirection, the consistency and I’m sure the lack of pain to our sweet girl.

So the moral of the story is probably several parts: do lots and lots and lots of research, get really, truly qualified people who know what they are doing and trust your instincts about something when it doesn’t feel right. There are those out there who are really good and really care and know what they are doing, be sure to seek them out. But be careful of those who claim to know what they are doing but really don’t. They might know enough for certain families and have their place, but if you have a tough situation (which really should never have been tough), seek out those who are really great."	t5_2r067	True

Explaining that you must reinforce what you *do* want is sometimes difficult(for me anyway), that, or it just won't sink in. So I use this as an example, and it never fails to cause the lightbulb moment.

&gt;Would you rather, your boss show up at random times during the day and yell at you, even slap you on the arm, for not doing your job right, then walk away, leaving you to figure it out on your own; *or* your boss explains everything in detail, and even though you get confused at times, s/he is patient, shows you again, and gives you a $20 bonus every time you get it right? 

&gt;How long, and how much yelling and slapping, do you think it would take for you to eliminate all the wrong ways and figure out the right way on your own?

You barked exactly 0 times at Petsmart, including when a large man carried a huge bag of kibble next to you and when we were accosted by an off-leash schnauzer puppy. You amaze me. If people were so capable of change, we'd be living in utopia by now. I want to remember today. It ranks up there with the first time you turned away from something that scared you and went and sniffed a tree instead of lunging and growling, and laughing with joy while watching you try to climb out the window with your tail wagging in my face to get petted by drive through employees. I would like to bottle this feeling and give it to people who are frustrated and struggling to rehabilitate their dogs. I find it profoundly hilarious to think about how trapped and put-upon I felt when you first came to live with me. Thank you for forcing me to admit to myself that I was capable of taking responsibility for another life, for inciting in me a level of conscientiousness that I think I could only have achieved by being responsible for someone who can't complain when I screw up, for teaching me patience, by example and by rewarding me with that awe-inspiring feeling I get when I realize that you've measurably changed and I caused it, for making it abundantly clear that affection is not a finite resource, for forcing me to have blind faith about the things I can't control and to control the ones I can, and, most of all, for showing me the amazing things that both parties put into a relationship when quitting is not an option, and the healing, inspiring, life-affirming transformations that result. Enjoy the squeaky frog that you were calm enough to snatch up and carry out of the store in your mouth. I got a backup one that you can rip the fluff out of tomorrow. 

Love,
Mommy

I looked into BAT training as someone suggested and decided to give it a try - I'd walk him towards the deer (or, you know, he would pull me towards it), but stop every few feet and have him come sit and look at me; once he sat nicely and paid attention for a few seconds, we'd get a few feet closer, and so on until we got to the deer. We only had to do this maybe 3 times before the deer became totally mundane!

""My 9 week old dog bites, barks, and pees on the floor! I've tried everything, including hitting, and it's not working!""

""I've had my puppy for a week and it doesn't listen!""

Can we use this thread to give tips/inform people of normal behaviors and get the mods to organize it into a guide? I'll organize it myself if the mods will just throw it up in the sidebar. 

We all know a big part of dog training is training the owner as well. Maybe with this, we can help someone know what to expect *before* they bring a puppy home or lower these ridiculously high expectations I see so often.

I am tired of people coming up to be with doomsday speak, ""I may have to give my dog back, I may have to return her to the breeder,"" etc over problems I can easily fix, then tell me 100$ is too much for an 8 week course. 

I am tired of patiently explaining dominance theory to people, David Mech, natural wolf packs, fluid structures, etc, and dog pack research only for them to look at me like I am stupid when I finish talking and continuing to use that vocabulary when talking about their dogs. 
... and I'm tired of the bizarre pride people have in their socially rude and bullying dog because that means, ""she's alpha,""

I am tired of people getting very excited about getting a CGC or a therapy dog certificate, only to stop attending classes. 

I am tired of people giving up on their dogs after basic training when it requires more than the short time span in class to train. Related, am I the only one on the fucking planet that DOESN'T find it overly difficult to teach a dog to fucking heel? 

I am tired of people explaining to me that their dog is ""farming for treats,"" after I have repeatedly explained learning theory to them. I want them to fucking farm for treats, goddamnit! When they are sitting they are not running, jumping, yelling, digging, biting, whining, snapping, or ignoring me. This a is fucking good thing, people. 

Or people who just don't reward their dog for their good behavior, and bitch and moan when those behaviors extinguish. 

I am tired of dealing with people that are clearly insane. Your dog is perfect, jumping is not a fucking sign of dominance aggression. 

I am tired of being happy when people will just admit to me that they didnt' work on anything that week at all, because that is preferable to them returning and blatantly lying to me about how their dog just doesn't get it.
...and I am tired of acting surprised when people do lie, and them training them to teach their dog how to do it five minutes after their initial complaint. 

I am tired of people coming to me with 5 month old dogs that ""can't be potty trained"", only to learn they are doing nothing at all that everyone in the fucking world advised them to do, and are too lazy to follow, and now just smack their dogs when they ""piddle in the house,"" or some nonsense. 

I am very, very tired of people who buy the wrong breed for them because they didn't think about it. Oh, great. Another 80 year old couple with a stubborn, independent Yorkie. Or a dachshund. Why can't they did a bichon, a maltese, a dogdamned shih tsu? WTF? Oh, your herding breed nips at your young children's feet when they run? Yes, that's clearly an aggressive dog. ARGGHHHH

I am tired of seeing people with goddamned pinch collars, slip collars, choke chains, providing them with an alternative, explaining about necks and tracheas, and have them continue with their shitty collar. 

I am tired of listening to people who ""sent their dog away for training,"" with pride (I suppose because it is expensive), warning them about the dangers of it, and then have them return later to tell me ""yeah, he came back like a zombie,"" REALLY? DID HE NOW? I am shocked! 

I am tired of the bizarre breed snobs who treat their expensive, imported dogs like shit. 

""But she loves her pinch collar,"" no, you idiot, she likes going places.

If I hear one more goddamned person tell me about their friend who trains police dogs, I swear to god, I am going to quit on the spot. Your friend does not train fucking police dogs. You're lying, or your friend is lying, and even if there were no lies, most police dog trainers use shitty, outdated methods completely and totally unsuitable for pet dogs (I would argue any dogs, but I can get the idea that you need those dogs out asap. I feel a conflict when I advocate for more humane police dog training methods when barely trained humans are sent to war. In both cases, you could make an argument for speed over correctness in the interest of cost and time, but I digress from my original rant).

I AM FUCKING TIRED OF CESAR FUCKING MILAN and his bullshit vocabulary, his bullshit methods and his bullshit expectations.

I'm tired of people who just refuse to do little things to help their dogs succeed. 

I'm increasingly frustrated and unhappy. I love training. I love the results. I love the ""I get it now,"" look on a puppy's face. I like wagging tails. I love advanced training. Heel is pretty to watch, and adorable on a puppy. I love knowing I am hopefully preventing irritation later and giving the owners a better way to deal with issues than screaming at their dog. 

I'm just really, really frustrated. 

I am sure I am not alone. How did you other trainers get through this period?  


EDIT 7/18: 

THANKS!!!

Thanks for all the feedback, guys. I really appreciate the perspective. I bought a copy of Coaching People to Train their Dogs yesterday, and I am really hoping that will help me explain some of the things I am having issues with in a way that will connect with each owner. 

As many have said, this was a rant post and honestly, it helped immensely to just ""Get it out."" Yesterday, one of the adult rescue dogs I train got his CGC as well, and that helped boost my spirits. When he came to me, he didn't even know how to walk on a leash. His parents were also some of the great clients, so that was a win overall. A happy day. 

My attitude did suck. This is not a representation of my entire attitude, and it not something anyone, at all, except people on the internet are aware of. I am patient with my clients, and actually did not get into training to train dogs, but got into it for the teaching experience. Enjoying training dogs was something that developed out of wanting to improve my public speaking and education skills. 

While I do agree there is no one way to train a dog, I strongly believe that dominance theory is harmful, and punishment is unnecessary. If you are a professional trainer, you will know, like I do, that most of the cases where a dog is ""disobedient"" is due to stress or a poor reinforcement history or raising criteria too fast. I would NEVER EVER punish anything- human or otherwise- when there was a chance that their behavior was due to a lack of understanding or proper teaching. And I will say that people who do punish in these situations should not be teachers, or trainers, or in charge of any being who is subject to their authority. "	t5_2r067	True

My dog is TERRIFIED of vet offices, so much so that she will void her bowels on the floor. I explain to the staff that she's fearful and it's best not to approach her or reach out for her, but inevitably, something spooks her and bam, poop everywhere.

Last time I went I tried taking her favorite stinky treats (salmon!), thinking I could get some positive associations going. But she turned her nose up at the them. And then pooped on the floor when the tech came out to get us.

Yesterday, I tried a new idea. I brought our regular treats and the clicker. (We've been in various training classes since November, so for her clicker = awesome stuff.) 

I decided to try to get her to Touch, since that's a tried-and-true trick of hers. I held out my hand. Her eyes darted around the room and she shook like a leaf.

So I cheated. I moved my hand toward her and lightly bonked her on the nose, clicked, and then held out a treat. As soon as she heard the click, her brain snapped back into focus and she gobbled up the treat!

We spent the rest of the time in the waiting room practicing her more familiar commands (touch, sit, down, paw). Click and treat. Click and treat. She was still aware of her surroundings, but was no longer shaking and the big bonus: NO POOP ON THE FLOOR. :-)"	t5_2r067	True
1374843446.0	1j3e9g	PSA on crate training	donteatolive	59	8	63	"I often hear amont these threads people describing behavior problems that can be fixed by crate training and then as soon as crating is brought up they immediatelly say their dog cannot be crate trained.  I firmly believe that at least 90% of these cases are dogs who absolutely *can* be crate trained, their owners just don't know how or gave up very quickly.  So I wanted to share a quick story for these owners.  
  
This weekend I am petsitting/training a couple of small dogs.  When their owners dropped them off they said they cannot be crated because they are too afraid of crates and they need to just be gated into a room at night.  I was also informed that one of the dogs is not potty trained at all and the other dog is a small puppy who they have just been taking out at times - she will pee outside but she will also pee inside and this is because they ""cannot be crate trained"".  
Last night I kept them both in the kitchen with a doggie bed on one end of the floor and a large canvas crate on the other end (this canvas crate is the correct size for my corgi and these two dogs are chihuahua sized).  As the night went they were reasonably crying and barking as it's their first night away from home, but when I would go in to give them something to self soothe (a bone or a peanutbutter kong) I would always put them in the crate (the treats not the dogs) and as the night progressed I noticed they were in the crate when they were quiet and at the gate out of the kitchen when they were crying.  
Pair with this that all night long they were having accidents in the kitchen and this morning only one peed outside - the other peed immediately on coming back inside.  I shut them into the crate.  There was some scratching and there's still a little light crying every minute or two, but they are *much* quieter and calmer than when they were out of the crate.  They are unwilling to soil the crate so they are only coming out to go to the bathroom.    

So I guess the moral here is that often when we think a dog is too afraid of a crate maybe we just aren't using the right kind of crate (wire instead of canvas, canvas instead of plastic, every dog is different).  Maybe we aren't giving enough positive incentive to choose to go in the crate (treats/bones/toys).  Maybe we give up after the first night of crying instead of letting them learn to just be away from us for the night.  But the big one really is that if you can't potty train the animal do try whatever you can to crate it because the crate is an integral part of potty training and it makes it so much easier on the animal to choose not to soil their bed instead of choosing not to soil your floor. 


TL;DR was told dogs couldn't ever be crate trained because they are too afraid and that they aren't potty trained because of it.  After about 15 hours both dogs are crated with minimal crying and aren't soiling the crate. "	t5_2r067	True
1367880755.0	1dtnof	Notes from an ER vet tech-making it easier to come to the vet and what to do when you're there.	xrareformx	52	4	40	"Hey friends! Thought I would share some insight with you from things my career has taught me. I am an ER veterinary technician, licensed and all. I wanted to say a few things to help you guys out (and us too!) when you're at the vet either in an emergency situation or just a yearly exam.

I've been working overnight ER for a few years now and I'll be covering emergency situations first. Here are some things that will make it easier for everyone involved with an ER vet visit:

          1. Don't anticipate and don't feed into your dog's fear.
-Most dogs are frightened upon arrival. In this situation, as temping as       it is, don't baby them and don't be protective over them. Watch your actions. In an ER setting, if I need to take that animal to the back for immediate care, don't ask to come back with the animal, I won't let you. Remember this is an ER and we have a lot going on back there that I may not want you to see or be around. Honestly, with most overprotective owners, I will just take the dog away from them and take that animal to the back where they can't feed off their anticipation and protectiveness. This enforces the dog to be fearful of us and we are there to help! Make it a positive thing. I know most emergency situations are stressful, but KEEP YOUR COOL. I see so many frantic owners and this creates frantic dogs. Staying calm will help us, and your dog, immensely.

              2. If your dog is not okay with strangers, TELL US.
-When I take you and your dog into a room to get their vitals, I will always ask you if your dog is okay with strangers approaching it. If your dog is fear aggressive or protective over you, you need to tell me right off the bat. Don't be offended if you tell me ""Yeah, he loves people. He's fine with everything!"" and I choose to take him to the back to get vitals. Many times you are telling me one thing, but your dog is telling me another. I have been snapped at many times, and I know the body language that comes before this. I know a few people that muzzle their animal before walking through our door, and that's not a bad thing. Please be aware of your dog's state of mind and as mentioned above, don't feed into it.

            3. Know what to expect-tests and estimates
-No, our services are not free. It costs money to run a hospital and provide round the clock care for your animal. Unlike human medicine, we don't get help from government agencies or donations. The cost of caring for your animal comes from you and you alone. This is how it is at ALL animal hospitals. Services are to paid for right then and there. The majority of hospitals don't do payment plans, as we just won't end up being paid. Your vet will most likely make an estimate before starting treatment so you know what you're getting into. This includes tests we may need to run to try and figure out what's going on with your animal. We are there to help and good clinics aren't going to waste their materials and your time/money on tests we don't think are necessary. 

          4. WHAT TO DO IN A TRUE EMERGENCY
-If you bring your dog in, and he is in the process of going agonal (breathing and or heart has stopped), we will need an immediate answer on if you would like us to perform CPR or not. KEEP IN MIND-IT IS RARE FOR CPR TO WORK (unless that patient is under anesthesia and can usually be reversed). 95% of animals I have done CPR on don't make it, the 4% we have gotten back had to be on life support and will most likely crash again, and I have seen only one walk out of the hospital after getting her back, and she will never be the same due to the lack of blood flow to the brain at the time of CPR. HAVE A PLAN AND KEEP CALM. We will need to ask questions to try and figure out what led up to this point. Also-CPR costs about $500-1000 in time and materials to perform and your animal will most likely need to be hospitalized after and have a couple thousand dollars worth of care before you can even think of taking them home. Is this something you're prepared to do? Do you have a backup fund for something like this? We can't do any sort of treatment until we know what you're financially capable of. Tell us right off the bat how much you have at that time to put into it so that we can work around this and do the best we can with that. 


Most of the time we will be feeding your dog peanut butter and distracting them in the back during a treatment. I try and make it a positive experience for them. We use treats and positive reinforcement to get things done most of the time, but yes, sometimes we have to use force. Make sure your dog is okay with restraint and bring handled. Desensitize them to things like touching their ears and holding on to them and holding them down. Make a game of it. Make sure your dog is comfortable with feet being touched and mouths being opened and looked at. It helps us a lot. There's a lot more I could cover, and if you have any questions on anything-ASK ME! I'm here to help and NEVER be hesitant to call your local veterinarian for advise, although if we think your dog needs to be seen, we will just tell you to bring them in. We cannot diagnose over the phone and it's always better safe than sorry!

I've tried ignoring her until she drops it and then picking it up (she darts for it as soon as I show interest), walking away to get her to follow (at which point she just sits down to chew the ball) but today I finally came up with a new solution that seems so obvious. 

She fetches, brings it back, I either get her to drop it (50% of the time) or wait until she gets bored and drops it. Then I give her the ""leave it"" command, which has a much higher success rate. She lets me take it slowly without trying to snatch it from my hand, I have her sit, and I throw it. She's already started bringing it back and dropping it for me.

I guess my question is that I don't really understand what giving my dog a job means? I've heard that people teach their dogs to pick up or go get the newspaper, but is that their only job or do you teach them several jobs/tasks to complete?

OR is it training your dog to be a guard/rescue/herding dog?

GingerApocalypse	52	6	12	"Back in November, I rescued a 3 year old male GSD. It was a direct rescue, we got him straight from a family that basically never spent any time with him and kept him chained in a backyard 24/7. As such, I had a massive list of things to work on with him. He had never had any obedience training at all, never walked on a leash, never lived indoors, and was never socialized very well. He was reactive towards people (normally jumpy-excited but sometimes defensive), lunged at cars and passersby, and was/is SUPER dog aggressive. On the plus side, he was generally a complete sweetheart to people, even kids, and he is smart and easily bribed with a tennis ball.

It's been a long few months since I first started working with him, but by lurking this subreddit and enlisting professional help, he's made some serious progress. The past few days, though, it seems like every time I expected him to act up a little bit he was absolutely perfect.

* We have had people in and out all weekend, and he hasn't jumped or gotten over-excited once - even when a toddler was running around him waving a glowstick. He didn't even rush the door when they came in wanting to say hi; he waited by the couch with me not even holding him, then went up politely.

* He's a long way off from mastering heeling, but he didn't try to drag my arm off on walks. When he pulled, it was gentle and easy to correct, and overall he kept the leash pretty loose.

* He didn't bark/lunge at a single person or car outside. Even when a woman powerwalked by and loudly demanded I keep a tight hold on him, he just stood at my side and watched her without incident.

* The big one for him: This morning, when I went behind the house to deposit his leavings in the trash, the neighbor's chow was out in their yard, visible through the fence. I braced myself for him to go nuts, but NOTHING HAPPENED. He stood there and stared while I threw the bag away, then followed me back around the house with just a little leash tug. Man, when we rounded that corner he got ALL OF THE LOVE. I was so proud of him.

So yeah, I just wanted to rave somewhere that he's actually making progress. I know there have been times when I thought it was hopeless, and I'm sure anyone else with a reactive dog can relate. Moments like these remind me that he's getting better all the time, and with enough small victories like these I won't need to worry at all someday."	t5_2r067	True

Ok, 5 months ago I rescued 7 new born puppies from the street. I kept one, gave the others away in adoption. They were 3 weeks old by then. The vet told me they were belgian malinois cross with unknown breed. So, anyway, he's 5+ months now and it's been causing a lot of trouble, my mother's already neurotic and now with the dog's behavior she's just crazy. 

He obeys whenever he feels like, I've managed to teach him 'sit' , 'down' and 'come'. He stays down when about to be fed until I give the ""go"" command. The only moment he really obeys it's when there's food/treats involved. When we're eating, he jumps on the table and steals our food, he will never obey when i say ""sit!"" or ""down"" he will just try to steal until I get tired and take him out. At times he goes crazy and bites out of nowhere, jumps on people and he won't obey shit, he jumps into every bed and gets in every room he's suppossedly not allowed. I can't open ANY door, as he will go in and stay there forever, if i try to take him out he'll bite me.

I'm being really patient but I don't know what to do anymore, whenever he bites I do the 'ignore him' thing and even the 'yelp!' thing and leave but he follows me and jumps one me/bites my feet and my only possible salvation is to go into a room and lock myself in, it's like the dog rules the freaking house...

My mother told me she's done, she took him outside (it's a little backyard, definetely not enough for him to have fun/run) and he's staying there now, not allowed into the house anymore and i'm just afraid that'll make things even worse. She said he's leaving if he breaks anything else.
No, I'm not taking him out for walks, surprise surprise, my mother won't let me because she says he's getting dirty and he'll mess up the inside of the house, I feel like my mother's being a huge part of the problem here but she's even more foolish than the dog...

Please, Help me, I'm going insane here :("	t5_2r067	True

Just because he is bouncing around and pulling to get to you doesn't mean you should play with him. I won't pick your baby up and hold him because he is crying...

I have been trying to get my dog to be ""okay"" with having bunnies in the house, it's something I;ve wanted forever but never knew how properly to train it. Then /u/retractableclause posted [this](http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/16_7/features/get-along-in-multi-species-house_20783-1.html) article about getting a dog to get along with cats and other small animals. We have done about six or seven sessions and today, I was able to drop the leash and let him sniff freely through the cage bars. He was a little whiny and excited, but three weeks ago this would have ended in blood or at least very traumatized bunnies.

He went to his crate when he was feeling overwhelmed, which is another huge milestone, as we've been working on crate training but I didn't think we'd reach that point so soon. His ""leave its"" and other cues were perfect as well. AND three minutes after we ended, he's cool as a cucumber in his crate, hasn't made a peep since he went in there, and the bunnies are both flopped [a sign of relaxation and comfort--a big deal especially because my one rabbit does not usually flop].

Here are some pictures:

1372801994.0	1hixhp	[Trick Of The Month: July 2013] Heeling Backwards!	Minna93	49	4	22	"Welcome the the first ever Trick Of The Month challange in /r/Dogtraining  history! This first trick will be one where your dog gets to practice rear end awareness, and it's a good foundation for a whole bunch of other tricks. I hope everyone who reads this will give it a shot. Here's how TOTM works: 

&gt;1: Teach dog trick. Don't own a dog? Borrow your neighbors or grandmas dog, they'll be thrilled when you teach them cool things. 
&gt;
&gt;2: Film dog performing trick. 
&gt;
&gt;3: Upload video to internet. 
&gt;
&gt;4: Post link to video of dog doing trick in the comments of this thread. This thread will close when nexts months challenge is announced, and the current TOTM will be linked in the sidebar. 

The Trick Of The Month for July 2013 is, as the titel says, **Backwards heeling!** 

You have the dog in heeling position and move straight backwards. The dog moves backwards holding the heel position. 

**Youtube links showing how to train the behaviour:** [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7LK32vvFZA), [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv1GcAd-nTQ). 

**Some tips and pointers from me:** 

* Set your dog up for success: Start out next to a wall so your dog can't turn. 

* If your dog doesn't move backwards with you, you can try luring it by holding a treat beneath its chin. 

* If the dogs rear end turns away from the wall, tripping you over, don't cry. Have a laugh and try again. 

**""My dog already knows this trick, but I want to train/participate and it kinda feels like cheating.""**

If you feel like this, you can either upload a video as it is, or add some more level of difficulty. Can your dog...      

* heel backwards on both sides, not just left? 

* do neat looking turns while heeling backwards?  

* heel backwards over an obstacle? 

I'll post a demo video of my Lady doing this trick as soon as I can, which will probably be next week (I'm going away from my home/town/internet/civilization tomorrow, will be back sunday). But You can, and should, definately start training right now. 

I'm looking forward to see your submissions. Good luck! "	t5_2r067	True
1366876464.0	1d2ko2	Help, the private trainer I hired hit my dog. What do I do?	vibrantbloom	54	8	60	"Throw away account because I want to stay anonymous for now. 

My dog has developed an aggressive leash reactivity toward most dogs and will growl and lunge when meeting most strange dogs for the first time. If they get too close to her, she will attack them. So far, no bites or broken skin, just a lot of noise. But its scary for everyone involved because she is a very big dog, over 100lbs.

She is only a 1.5yo puppy and I want to correct this behavior before it gets any worse. So I hired a local private trainer for 4 sessions. 

I thought she was weird at first when during our first consultation, she wouldn't make eye contact with me at all. She literally never once made eye contact with me. The first session was positive reinforcement training and I liked that, so I overlooked the weird staring off into the distance thing. We also introduced a prong collar and leash pressure, which I was fine with. But on the second session, we started on the dog reactivity. She had two of her dogs closed off in an adjacent yard fenced off with chainlink, and she had me walk up toward the dogs with my dog. I would turn away whenever my dog would grow agitated or growl, which was often.

Then she had me go right up to the fence and have her sit. My dog reacted as she normally does, by growling and beginning to lunge. I corrected her with a pop to prong collar. Then out of nowhere, the trainer came in, grabbed my dog by her muzzle, smacked her roughly on the face and chased her off while telling her ""NO! BAD DOG! WE DO NOT DO THAT!"" and then turns to me and tells me I need to nip that behavior in the bud because it is unacceptable. 

Well no shit lady, that is why I have come to you. I have not, however, come to you to have you hit and intimidate my dog. 

What do I do? I do not want to finish my remaining 2 sessions now. I paid $180 for the set, so $45 per session. Is it unreasonable of me to email her and ask for a $90 refund? Because the more I think about it, the more uncomfortable I feel bringing my dog back to her because of her violent outburst."	t5_2r067	True
1362165789.0	19h8vp	It's a great day when training pays off	bananabelle	45	3	22	"Hey doggit, I just wanted to share a success story and invite you to share yours too!

We adopted our little sheltie/terrier mix [Gambit](http://imgur.com/9K1Pkrbh) about 2 months ago and he's an absolutely lovely and playful sweetheart... Until you put a leash on him and he sees another dog.

He growled and snapped at our neighbor's dog about a week after we got him and he was rejected from daycare because they ""interviewed"" him on leash with another dog and he snapped at that dog as well. Walks are difficult since we have a lot of dogs in the neighborhood and he would constantly bark loudly and lunge at them. To help Gambit out, I've been reading r/dogtraining, watching Victoria Stillwell's show (*It's Me or the Dog*), and signed up for obedience class, and took a private lesson with a trainer. 

I knew I had to treat him every time he saw another dog, but we started doing it a lot more consistently in the past couple of weeks and it has paid off greatly. Before we signed up for lessons, I would try to do it during our morning walks, and my husband would often forget to bring treats when he takes him out in the evening, but after we made sure to do it consistently, we started seeing results.

The biggest triumph was this morning, when our neighbor's off-leash dog ran up towards a leashed Gambit, and Gambit had no reaction whatsoever. I made sure to give him lots of treats and praise for that one, and the rest of our morning walk went by great without any hitches! We ran into at least one other dog while walking and he didn't react to that one either.

Now I'm not so scared to take him on walks even if I know other dogs ar around. Thank you for continuously have such great discussion and tips on this subreddit!

In late 2009, our dog Buster passed away after a long, painful battle with cancer. Buster was a great dog, the kind you only see once in a lifetime. He knew pretty much every trick in the book, stayed inside the yard without any attendance (Or a fence!), would rather pop than potty indoors, and was just, overall, the smartest and most loyal friend you could ask for. I say this because after he passed, I think my family really forgot how much work training your average dog can be (We adopted him from my father, who had already trained him as a pup), and we rushed into adopting a new dog from our local shelter. And that's how we got Zoey. 

http://imgur.com/juk7w Here she is! Isn't she cute? I'm not sure what breed she is (Neither did the humane society), but she was so adorable that my family decided to adopt her right there on the spot. I knew I had some work ahead of me, but little did I realize at the time the laundry list of problems this pup has in the head department. And that's where I need your help.

So first, and foremost, is her fear problem. Zoey is, without a doubt, the flightiest dog I have ever seen. She is afraid of absolutely everyone and everything, from cats to people, but she is *especially* afraid of males. Males like me. I am not sure of who had her before she came into the possession of the shelter, but I am pretty sure she was abused; She reacts to me, whether I am telling her she's a ""Good doggie!"" or offering her a treat, as though I was running at her screaming with a switch. She has no reason to react to me like this (I have never hit her, ever. I don't believe in pain-based encouragement), and yet to her, I am the big, scary monster in the house. This is a problem, given that I am the only one in the house who is bothering to even try training her. I would really love to be able to get close to my dog, so I can love on her and give her treats. Any tips? If it helps, here's what I've tried:

* Sitting/laying on the floor in the same room with her. She will run away or, if she can't leave the room, squish herself in the corner and wait for the death she knows is about to come.

* Treats. Zoey likes treats. Mmm, beggin' strips. She just won't eat them or even look at them if I'm in the same room as the treat.

* Walks. Zoey loves walks. She will actually come to me if I give a cry of ""Walkies!"". Unfortunately, if I do any action that suggests to her that she might not be about to go on a walk, she bolts.

Almost done! You're a marathon runner of a reader. I again apologize for the wall of text. I don't know how to shut up sometimes, I swear! D:

Second, is housetraining. Zoey is only housetrained insomuch as she knows to ""Go"" in the back porch, where the floor is concrete and can be mopped. I absolutely refuse to discourage her with newspapers or nose-shoving, so I am left with positive encouragement. And this is where the second problem begins.

Zoey -will not- go to the bathroom outside, and it's pretty obvious that her previous owner discouraged her (Probably with abuse, by the way she reacts) to relieve herself while walking, or even walk on grass. Yes, if you can believe it, she is actually convinced she will be smacked if she walks on the grass, and I have to encourage (Read as: Push) her onto it to convince her it's okay, much to her immense joy (Did you know grass is filled with smells? Because hot damn, is grass filled with smells, all of which have to be sniffed!)

I have convinced her to pee outside only once, and it must have been an ""I can't hold it anymore!"" moment, as she whimpered in fear as she squatted down, and did what I can only describe as looking at me for permission. After reassuring her that ""Yes, Zoey! Such a good dog! Yeeeees!"", she went, wincing her face away as she did so, as if I was going to hit her any second. I didn't though, and only hugged and smooched on her approvingly, but she has not gone since. What can I do here, Reddit? Any advice?

So, there you have it. I knew I had work ahead of me when we adopted Zoe, but I never anticipated something like this, and I feel that I am WAY over my head with Zoe. It doesn't help that I have never had a dog before, but I am not going to give up. Zoey is my dog, and I love her to death. I know somewhere there's a great dog waiting to get out (She is forever sneaking licks at my legs when I'm not looking), and I could really use some good advice from someone that knows what they're doing. Thanks in advance!

Tl;dr version: I, having never had a dog before, have been left to care for a severely traumatized (And probably previously abused) dog, who's fear and trust issues prevent me from potty training or even being able to interact with her. Help!!

I very much enjoy ABC. Their staff isn't as educated when it comes to dog training as one may expect, but the mandatory externship has given me an opportunity to learn from dedicated trainers. I had learned *so much* from all of the bookwork, and I am learning more now in my externship than I had ever imagined. I believe everyone who wants to own a dog should study with ABC. You would be surprised at the amount of knowledge you can obtain.

I am very glad I chose ABC, and dog training is definitely my passion. Just two weeks ago I adopted a puppy (3 months old at the time, 4 months old now) because that is part of my studies - I must apply what I have learned to real life situations. Most people pay for college, I (on the other hand) get to adopt a puppy. It is so awesome. No question is too small, so, *ask me anything!*

* **You are giving him too much attention** My puppy is just shy of 6 months old. Yes, I am giving him a lot of attention right now because he is not an adult yet! He has to be supervised right now to foster good habits and nip bad habits in the bud.

* **You need to yell at him when he is (fill in the blank)** I feel like if you have to scream at your dog constantly, or yell to scare them, your dog is not trained. I don't want to be yelling at my dog all day or intimidate him! He learns very well when we are firm, but calm and loving.

* **You should just yank his leash on your walks if he smells things or sits down** Maybe I can control Kirby on his leash by yanking him today when he is 30 something pounds, but maybe not when he is 60 something pounds!! Even if he stayed small, If you have to get into a tug of war with your dog on the leash, your dog is not trained. Kirby responds to verbal cues, we just have to be patient, he will get better! I'm not going to physically overpower him to get what I want.

* **You take him to too many places** Yes, we take him to the dog park for exercise, puppy classes for training, puppy playtime for socialization, dog friendly restaurants so he can enjoy life with us instead of being home alone, at lease ONE long walk a day, a jaunt in the park, a fun hike to the river. A well exercised dog is a good dog!! he should be able to have fun experiences in life!**

* **You spend too much time with him/are obsessed with him (???)** I do not understand why someone would get a dog and treat it like furniture or a nuisance. We chose to get a dog because we wanted to pay attention to it and spend time with it! Not lock it up, or ignore it, or leave it by itself for hours. We chose him!

The worst part is that all of these criticizers have dogs that are not well behaved, or even well adjusted!! I love all of these dogs in the family, but they all have a TON of behavioral AND emotional issues that could have been avoided or alleviated with more attention, training, and positive interactions. Kirby is loving, social, intelligent, and so well behaved for a puppy! Everyone admits this, but criticizes the methods. Do they not wonder why he is so well behaved and well adjusted??

I just feel like I have to defend myself constantly when I feel like Kirby's behavior should speak for itself! **Does anyone else experience this or am I surrounded by crazy people??**

**tl;dr Everyone around me loves how my dog behaves, but is constantly criticizing my training methods, despite having poorly trained dogs themselves.**

I told Cowboy to down-stay, and although I peeked at him through the shelving as I grabbed his kibbles he stayed put!  He politely looked at the people who walked by him (even the men!) let people pet him, and stayed put.

He ended up with a whole crowd of GSD afficianados fawning over him, and he stayed put! He did keep his eyes on me, only giving token attention to his admirers.  As soon as I gave him the ""come heel"" cue he ran over to me and sat and waited for his reward.  Even the trainer gave me a thumbs up.

I know it may not be much but we've been clicker training pretty much every day, even on walks these past few days and he seems to have taken to it really well. So, for the past two days I've been training ""Come"" on our walks. What I would do is I have a retractable leash and I would let him walk ahead of me a few steps. I stop, say ""Loki, come"" and if he came I'd click and treat.

I now carry a bag with a compartment just for treats, so it's easy to treat him fast. So, he was very good with that and I took him to the park where we (dog owners) let our dogs play. A couple new dogs had come and he was about 50 meters away from him. I got kinda worried, so I said, loudly, ""Loki, come"". And he turned around and came right to me. I clicked, treated and petted him. I was so happy! Small victory but very important for me.

**Update:** We were able to repeat it again today multiple times with various distractions! It looks like he's got it and it was kinda impressive how he followed my instructions and I could practically walk him off leash today. It's one of my aspirations that I'll be able to calmly walk him off leash.

Spare3Parts	39	2	19	"So I have a 6 month old puppy that is a total butt when it comes to going on walks.  I'm clicker training her and she's slowly getting it, unless there is a person.  She loses her mind, she whines and jumps and pulls and wiggles.  I've tried clicking and treating when she sits when they are far away, but if they face her or come towards us she goes insane.  

It's embarrassing at this point.  She will not sit still, she will not listen to me at all, I use the highest value treats and she could care less.  At the vet she constantly wiggles and squirms to see people and will not settle.  When people come up to pet her she jumps, claws at their hands, wiggles, licks and is just obnoxious.  

I just moved to a new state with my husband, I do not have family or friends that could come over and help by being practice.  I've tried going to pet stores but she is constantly pulling and jumping to meet people.  I can't get her to do anything right, so I have nothing to click and treat.  

Please help me before I lose my mind.

**Tl;dr:  My puppy goes apeshit when she sees people and I've researched all the conventional clicker ways to treat it but they suggest using friends/family and I don't have any.  What can I do now.**"	t5_2r067	True

1352337957.0	12tyrf	Counter-Conditioning is AWESOME	vlyandra	36	4	7	"Koby, despite his lab heritage, felt that baths were the worst thing in the world. Getting a 70 lb dog into the bathtub when he doesn't want to go is difficult, so I started training him to get into the tub on his own. The first few sessions were just having him hand-target further and further into the tub until he'd put his front feet in. Later I got him to jump completely into the tub and then treats would rain from the sky. Once he stopped giving stress signals in the tub, I turned on the water just a trickle and fed him tons of treats. Once I was able to get the water all the way on without him freaking out, I started rubbing him all over with dry hands, and then with wet hands, then would pour a little water on him and rub him.

I recently gave him a full-fledged bath (with lots of treats) and he was calm about the whole procedure. What really amazed me, though, is that a few days later I was cutting up treats to train outside and he ran into the bathroom and tried to get into the tub. (He has trouble doing it without a tub mat and the bath mat on the side of the tub) So of course I indulged him and let him jump in and gave him treats.

Seriously, if your dog hates baths... making bathtime something they look forward to makes everything so much better."	t5_2r067	True

She's a pit/english bulldog mix and is as sweet as she can be. The only problem I'm having is she is terrified to go outside if there is even the slightest wind or rain in the air. And, in my opinion, she has good reason to be. 

She was rescued by a shelter after the 2011 Tuscaloosa tornado. Apparently, she was tied to a tree outside her owners house when it was completely destroyed. She was the only thing left there. They also think that tree was the only thing she knew for the entirety of her life until now. So, I'm trying to give some of the life she lost back. 

The only problem is, she's so petrified of going outside if she smells any sort of precipitation or wind, that she won't go to the bathroom. And if I bring her back inside, she'll go to the bathroom on the floor. My only option is to put her in her kennel and keep bringing her outside until she goes. But, that really can be an all day ordeal and i'm starting to get a bit stressed about it. I hate to keep her in her kennel so much...she deserves to be able to do whatever she wants, but at the same time I don't want her to think that using the potty inside on rainy days is okay. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to break her fear of wind/rain/distant thunderstorms? Or how I could get around it?

In my last post, I detailed the issue we were having with our new dog, Frank, attempting to lunge at our cats. I am very happy to say that we have since seen VAST improvement, after enlisting the help of a local behaviorist and positive trainer. Here's some deets:

1.) According to the behaviorist, Frank is NOT aggressive towards the cats. While he displays high intensity and interest in their presence, he is able to look away for a treat, and accept high-value treats in their presence. In her evaluation, she stated that Frank (having never seen or been with cats before) is attempting to greet them in the same way he might a dog--approach and heavy sniffing. The cats (obviously) don't like that, and they run away. That quick motion sends our excited pooch over the edge, creating a lunge. He just has no clue how to handle his excitement. 

2.) We've implemented a system of keeping everyone safe while the family re-adjusts. First, we installed tether points in our living room, hallway, and kitchen. This allows up to ensure Frank is tethered to a secure point (in his harness), on a short enough lead that if he DOES lunge for the cats, he doesn't get far enough to feel like the lunging ""got him somewhere"" in getting to the cats. Over the past few days, he has just sat quietly, observing, since he recognizes the lunging doesn't get him any closer. 

These tether points aren't an excuse for us to just peace out, though. We are ALWAYS armed with treats. Frank is rewarded for looking away from the cats, for sitting in their presence, and for remaining calm and relaxed when they are in the room. This early on, it is hit or miss. The trainer addressed the following system-- Distance, Intensity, Duration. Right now, Frank is able to calmly handle a cat at a distance of about 15 feet, that is staring at him or playing with low energy, and for about 15 minutes. However, this is an improvement over the initial scene of 25+ feet to not even seeing, just hearing, and for about twenty seconds. When I say ""handle"", I mean that his little brain doesn't overload and send him into an excited bout of jumping around. 

Thus, we have been carefully keeping an eye on his distance, intensity and duration with the cats. It's not always manageable, since cats are completely unpredictable. But the reinforcement is going a long way in giving Frank the tools he needs to handle surprise kitty visits in an appropriate manner. 

We also have times during the day where the cats are locked away, and the dogs are loose. This helps Frank to understand that cats AREN'T around every corner. 

3.) We take it one day at a time, and recognize the victories! Frank has sniffed noses with Monkee several times, been able to eat a bone while she's in the room, and the cats feel comfortable enough to come and sit in the room when the dogs are tethered. 


It's a nice feeling to have stuck by our rescue. Many of you advised that Frank would kill our cats, and I am pleased to say that I don't think that will happen. Of course, nothing is a guarantee. However, there is something to be said for quality, conscientious, careful and concerned pet owners. We are willing to put in the time, energy, and dedication to helping Frank be a part of our home. I am happy he will stay!

I've always lived with dogs at my parents' home, and I thought I was very ready for this pup:

We're a stable couple in our thirties; we've been discussing getting a dog for more than 2 years and have spent a lot of time comparing different breeds, adoption vs. official breeders, adult vs. pup, etc. I've re-read every book I have about dog-training and spent more time with my parents' dogs training and playing, both to get back into the habit, and to prepare them for our puppy since they'll basically be her 'uncles' and will spend quite some time with her.

We read up about dog psychology, 
had a long interview with the breeder and bought a whole lot of stuff the puppy will need. We've looked up vets, doggie hotels, schools (problematic in our region...) and even pet insurance...

**... and I started reading r/dogtraining, /r/puppy101, /r/dogs ...**

... and that's where I got scared...

Much of what I read is already familiar to me, but there are differences, new insights, things that make perfect sense *and* things that go against my feeling/experience.

To give an example; with my parents' dogs, our training was based on the dog's natural ways of communicating (like what you see in Lily Chin's charts); clicker training sound very counter-intuitive then since dogs don't make clicking sounds. The posts on here however prove that it works. On the one hand, I'm tempted to give it a go, on the other, I just can't believe it actually works and am afraid that if I'm not behind it 100%, it'll influence the effectiveness of the approach.

It gets worse if you start to google things; the internet is full of articles telling you how to alpha train your dog and giving really awful advice in general. Sometimes, it's clearly rubbish, but some things are very well written and it's not always easy to see which advice is good and which isn't (another example; I love National Geographic Magazine, it seems a very reliable source, yet here on the Belgian TV, they're still happily re-running Cesar Millan every afternoon...)

Through all of this, I'm getting very confused. On the one hand, I know 'my way' to be effective, yet respectful of the dog (no punishments or hurting the dog, always trying to look at things from his perspective and basing training on that), but on the other hand, there's so much more to be discovered, and I'm clearly a bit out of touch with the newest insights.


The problem is this: should I forget everything I know and start from scratch, based on what I read here? Is that even possible? I doubt it, especially since we only have 3 weeks before the puppy arrives.

So I was thinking: would it be possible to put together a short, comprehensive list of 'rules' to keep in mind while living with / training our dog? A few things you should never sin against, things you should keep in mind no matter what?

I'm hoping you guys have some suggestions to add to that list. Many thanks in advance!

I know that for many breeds, this is still the fear period, but he seems to be getting worse. He's an angel at doggie daycare off leash, and great with all the people working there, and he's getting better meeting people out in the world- when he approaches a new person, he can't wait to meet them, but after about 10 seconds of them petting him, you can start to see him get nervous and not want to be in the situation, especially when someone is looming over him.

But when we're at home, even after he's happily met a new person and been sitting around for a while, he freaks out if someone tries to pet him. Last night, he bit (thankfully a warning bite, but our friend still said it was a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale) one of our friend's hands just because he was approached him and began scratching his butt. He's also snapped at another friend a while ago for leaning over him to pet him when he was sitting down. 

If our dog approaches someone, it seems to be okay at first, but he quickly decides he's uncomfortable, and he is definitely not okay with being approached uninvited. I know not all dogs love to be pet, but at this point, we can't even have him around people at our house without telling them ""don't get your face near his, don't look in his eyes, and don't approach him, let him approach you"".

Add in that he has resource guarding issues, tries to eat everything he finds on the street (he's been to the vet 4 times in the last 15 months for eating something that he shouldn't have on walks), and that he is getting worse and worse at the vet, to the point that he snaps at the vet just for approaching him, and now requires a muzzle to give him shots, and we are at our wit's end, and my girlfriend has been crying since last night.

We have put SOO much work into this dog. Since we adopted him at 8 weeks (he was the calmest one of the litter, but of course it just turned out he was just calm because he was sick at the time), we have been training him nonstop, including constant positive reinforcement of body handling, but he still barely loves to be touched. We are first time dog owners, so we've definitely made mistakes, but I feel like all we do these days is try to train our dog- 75% of what we talk about every day is dog training and it's getting exhausting. I knew going in that having a dog was going to be a lot of work- a lot, and I was prepared for that. But I didn't think it was going to occupy almost every minute of every day.

Can anyone offer any advice? The vet who he just tried to bit recommended a behaviorist, and we are planning on trying one out. Are there any books on what to do to prevent him from freaking out from just be touched by strangers? 

Lastly, how much of this is just his age? I feel like he's at the outer edge of his fear period for a dog his size, so I'm afraid his age doesn't account for most of what's going on. I would love to hear that he will grow out of a good amount of it, but I'm afraid that's not the case.

Right now, my dog will start breathing heavily when she hears/smells the fenced dogs, and start pulling toward the fence — as if she wants to smell the dog that's barking at her. She has NEVER once barked back, but I can tell the barking either excites her or upsets her. (And honestly, it upsets me too. These dogs sound like they are going to break through their fences and attack us.)

I do my best to avoid the fences where I know the angry dogs will be, but it's not always possible. When my dog starts pulling and breathing heavily at the fenced dogs, I either turn around and walk the other way, or I cross the street to eliminate the trigger. I'd much rather train her to just calm down and accept that the dogs are barking. Is this possible? 

Just a note: The fences in my neighborhood are tall and made out of wood, so the dogs can't see through them to look at my dog. So there is no eye contact or visible teeth baring. From the dogs' point of view, it's all just sound and smell."	t5_2r067	True
1368211241.0	1e30z7	How do I teach my dog that cats aren't funny squeak toys	PyroNecrophile	31	2	8	"I recently adopted a new dog named Laika, she's a 1 year old lab/husky.  She's a really easy going dog.  She's very observant and seems to learn quickly.  She's always down for playing when it's convenient, but is perfectly content to sit on the couch and watch TV.  

I also have a Siamese, named Hammy, who is the most unique cat I've ever met.  He's the boss of the house, and I've never seen him angry about anything in his life.  He also has zero self preservation instinct, and has to be involved in EVERYTHING.   I also have 2 other cats that act like cats.

So, Laika's foster parents said that she was fine with cats, and she shows no sign of aggression towards them.  She has some slight food possessiveness issues, which I suspect is because she was a stray and she's very skinny.  Feeding her on a regular basis has been very helpful, and i can take anything out of her mouth.  She occasionally will growl if she's eating and Hammy comes around, but I immediately remove the food to teach her that this is why she can't have nice things, and she's doing much better.

My concern is that I'm worried that she thinks the cats are squeak toys.  She gets excited when they run around the house, and goes into play bow and wags her tail excitedly.  I know that she just wants to play with them too, but I'm overprotective, and all it would take is one bite from her and a shake and she could easily kill one of them.  She stays on a leash attached to me during the day, and I watch her like a hawk.  I've also got her to look at me when she sees the cats, and she's getting the idea that I don't even want her paying attention to them.  So she'll deliberately look away, but I can tell that she's still hopeful.  How can I teach her how to play with the cats while keeping them safe and not putting them in danger of a quick bite.  Hammy just runs right up to her and bounces off her back and he would bathe my former dog.  He has zero fear of her and was meowing excitedly as soon as he saw her.  I'm sure he'd love to play too, but I don't know how to keep everyone safe."	t5_2r067	True

Every morning, and I do mean EVERY morning, Titus wakes me up between 4:30am and 5:30am. He comes to my bedroom door, whines, chortles, and paws at the door. This has been going on now for a few months. If I just ignore him, he gets louder and more insisting. I originally thought it was because he needed to be let out to do his business....but it's not. 99.9999995% of the time it's because he wants to eat.  He eats plenty and the vet has told me he's just right as far as weight goes. However, he is EXTREMELY food driven. (I'm sure if he had to figure out how to operate a chainsaw to get to his food, he'd find a way to grow thumbs and run the chainsaw...I keep the chainsaw locked up for this very reason.) I have tried feeding him later at night with no luck.

At first I didn't mind it so much because I had to get up at 5:30am anyway. Now I don't have to get up that early and he still continues on...work days, off days, vacation days....I'm beginning to loose my patience with him.

Every day, we design novel scents, experiences, toys, and foods to keep life interesting for our animals. I think it would be an awesome concept to apply to pets, especially ones with separation anxiety or high energy.

I'm thinking it would help to design some for the specific carnivore stages of Search, Chase, Grab, Tear/Dissect/Chew.

Obviously there are lots of dog toys out there, but people tend to use the same few that their pet really likes. I'm trying to think of how we could switch things up for them.

Our wolves particularly love: Scent extracts on basically anything. They love to roll in things like mint, anise, and lemon. They adore tearing up boxes and newspapers. We cover deer antlers in newspaper for them to gnaw on and destroy.

If you could train your dog that only specific items you provide are okay to tear up, perhaps you could train out the need to tear up furniture. Our bichon adored shredding wrapping paper from presents, and would only do it when we gave it to him. That way we made sure he didn't consume any, but he still had a ton of fun.

1364485926.0	1b6kwj	Can a Traumatized Dog be Helped?	KaitKindly	30	3	15	"One year ago, I came home to see a skeleton of a hound dog stumbling all over my pastures.  I didn't have anything to catch her with, but I am a sucker for animals in need and tried anyway.  It took an hour of walking up and down the same fence before she just collapsed and I ""caught"" her.  We took her to the vet for two broken front paws, but nothing else was wrong with her.

She was so scared of everything, the slightest sound made her take off literally shitting herself.  A whisper could make her cower in the corner and pee everywhere.  My neighbor also told me he'd seen her thrown out of a truck the day before.  So I kept her, afraid she would be put down if I took her to anyone else.

It's been a year of taking sweetly, lots of food and treats, going on walks, befriending my other dogs, and sitting and petting her for long periods of time.  *A year.*  She still won't come to anyone but me, and she only started coming to me in the last couple of months, and being very nervous when she does.  She's still terrified of noises, movement, and pee's around anyone else.  She runs so much to avoid (even though they're not interested) my family and friends that feeding her three times a day still has her looking like a skeleton and sleeps standing up during the day to be ready to bolt again.  We had to triple reinforce the fence to keep her in because she continuously rams it to get out in a panic, cutting herself up once in a while, when one of us walks into the yard.  She doesn't even make eye contact, and flips out when she bumps into something like a chair.

I still don't want her to go elsewhere and risk a bad or no future since I know she is really a sweet and loyal dog under all the mess, but I am moving to start over in a couple of months and want her to come with us and start over, too...

Is there anything more I can do for her?  :(

**TL;DR:** Out of all my rescue animals, this dog is the toughest. A year of sweet care later, she is still piss-herself-terrified of anyone, any movement, any sound. What else can I do?"	t5_2r067	True
1361309713.0	18uc5y	My dog just bit my housemate--I'm freaking out.  	fancygreatcrimes	29	3	32	"Dog: 
1.3 yo, neutered, male, Australian Cattle Dog who has shown dog aggression issues before, but never human aggression issues. 

Story:
My Australian Cattle Dog has some manageable aggression issues; he doesn't go out places with other dogs all over the place because he does not like other dogs that he hasn't been introduced to properly.  He's not a spontaneous dog.  Any new dog in his environment has to be introduced over about a period of a few days and then he is totally cool with them.

I just had a new housemate move in with her 4mo, 50lb puppy who is very rude, and very jumpy--but sweet natured.  My dog and hers have met only a handful of times and yesterday was the first day they were allowed to be in the same area--and this happened without me allowing it.  EDIT:  This puppy, 4.5mo, is unneutered

Today my dog bit my male housemate, pretty badly.  Just one bite and then a quick release--didn't go back to bite again, he ran away as soon as he bite my housemate's hand.  The situation was this: 2 out of 3 dogs were rough housing and the 4mo rude puppy was jumping on me.  My dog growled and politely (no aggressive body language) place himself between me and this rude puppy.  Then my dog walked away.  The puppy came back and jumped on me again--my dog got upset again and started growling a little louder, a little longer.  My male housemate comes up and grabs my dog and proceeds to push him into a ""sit"" and hold him in a vulnerable position while the puppy now runs at my dog.  My dog continues to growl, feeling trapped, and then bites the hand of my housemate.

1: I'm freaked out.
2: How can I make sure this doesn't happen again?
3: Any advice about dealing with this kind of behavior?

1355157279.0	14lyrg	Dog is becoming overprotective of my kids.	Superfish1984	30	1	10	"**TL;DR: Our dog won't let anyone get close to our 2.5 year old when we are out on walks, even if they are kind and calm. She goes straight into attack mode the moment someone goes near our daughter. I don't know how to train this out of her and would appreciate any advice!**

We have a black lab cross (we think crossed with a shepherd type dog, but don't know for sure as she was a rescue from northern Canada) that is a little over 2 years old. We have had her since she was about 6 weeks old (her and her sister were found starved in a dump).

In the last few weeks, she has become increasingly protective of my two little girls (2.5 and 5 years old). She and the kids are very close to each other; she sleeps on one or the other's bed every night, cuddles on the couch, plays fetch with them, etc. She is incredibly gentle and patient with the kids, and is wonderful with all of our friends' children as well.

She gets a pretty good amount of exercise. When my husband is home (he travels frequently for work), she gets a walk during the day and a long run in the evening. When he isn't home, my 2.5 year old and I will take her out for a 1 to 1.5 hour walk in the day (while the older one is at school) and in the evenings I play fetch with her in the yard until she gets bored of it. We take her to the dog beach a couple of times a week and she goes swimming in the ocean, which is quite possibly her favorite activity.

The problem comes when I am walking her with my 2.5 year old. When we are out for a walk, if any people or dogs come near my daughter,  Millie (the dog) barks and bares her teeth and lunges at them. She hasn't bitten anyone yet, but I am terrified that she will someday. I want to train this out of her but don't know how. When she acts like this, I've been trying to redirect her attention by making her sit, lay down, then ""relax"" (she has to shift her hips to the side so that she isn't ready to spring into action, and she puts her head on her paws). Then I make her stay in the ""relaxed"" position while the person or dog interacts with my daughter. This works as long as I have her in the relaxed position, but if I release her (in the hope that she has seen that the person or dog isn't a threat) she goes straight back into attack mode.

Any help with this would be GREATLY appreciated!"	t5_2r067	True

1354111661.0	13xlyh	UPDATE: Issues With Roommate's Dog	kelciebee	34	7	7	"[Here's the previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/13vxqg/issues_with_roommates_dog/)

Ok, so I'd been ruminating all day and well into the night about how to approach this. I received a ton of great advice. I'm just *terrible* at confronting people/sticking up for myself. Eventually the stress of being upset compounded by the stress of trying to figure out how to initiate the conversation culminated in my first ever anxiety attack (I never knew how awful they really are). After that, I realized that I couldn't keep bottling it up because it was affecting my health. 

I talked to my roommate about it this morning, and she was totally willing to work this out. She said it was a huge part of the reason she wanted to move back out of her parent's house (as they are the ones that ""untrained"" him in the first place - apparently he wasn't like this before). She said she definitely doesn't want him biting other people and sometimes he bites her too and she wasn't sure how to fix that.

We've agreed that, during the day when everyone is at work, we're going to put a baby gate in the hallway where her room is and keep him behind it. That way he isn't cooped up and he won't be isolated. He'll still be able too see, hear, and smell what's happening in the house, but my cat's won't be punished for his bad behavior anymore. When people get home, we can remove the baby gate and pick up the cat food so he doesn't get into it (they'll have had ample time to get their fill during the day). 

She has had to keep her bedroom door closed because one of my cats marks her bed (I think because he doesn't like the dog?). With the baby gate, her dog can access her room (which he prefers), and she can put his food in her room to alleviate some his food aggression issues in the living room. The cat won't be able to get into her room, so she won't have to worry about him peeing on her bed. 

As moving him out of spots on the couch has resulted in biting, we've also agreed that he won't be allowed on the couches anymore. This way he doesn't have the chance to bite anyone. He doesn't like being grabbed by the collar, and until we deal with the root of his aggression, I don't feel comfortable trying. Instead, if he jumps on a couch I will give a ""Get Down"" command, and gently push him with a pillow until he gets down. Once he's back on the floor, I can give him lots of praise. It seems to be effective so far. I don't get bit. He doesn't get frightened. And he's smart, so he's catching on quickly.

I explained to her that there are a lot of foods that are very toxic to dogs that are everyday snacks for people, and that feeding him table scraps is getting dangerous for him. If he continues to steal food off of the table, he's eventually going to get into something that makes him very sick, and no one wants that. So no more table scraps. As he learns to leave table food alone, it will reduce stress for me, as I won't have to constantly worry about leaving a snack on the table that makes him sick. 

I've also been looking up different games that are constructive ways to utilize a dog breed's skill set so he has an outlet for his energy. We found some herding games to play with him as well as a few ""smart"" dog games to make him use his brain. 

She seems really excited to get started. I think she really wanted him to be more obedient and just didn't know where to start. I'm glad everything worked out and I was wigging for nothing. 

Oh! And my mother and I have a relatively strained relationship. She *loves* dogs and is amazing with them. She's super knowledgeable, so we're thinking about having her stop by maybe once a week or so to work with the dog and teach us how to work with him as well. It's win win because my roomie gets help with her dog and it's an opportunity for my mother and I to try to build our relationship. Thanks for all of your help and advice! Everyone has been very helpful (and we're totally picking up a clicker as suggested because neither one of us wants to yell at the dog or punish the dog in negative ways).  

**TL;DR: Everything is working out really well. I was worried for nothing. We're on track to resolving all of the issues.**  "	t5_2r067	True
1345486391.0	yj913	It worked-barking solution		32	4	52	"Since we've gotten our chihuahua mix almost three years ago, she's been a barker. After trying for some time to get her to stop, I just accepted the fact she's a barker and gave up. Our new puppy takes cues from the older dog and she was becoming a barker too. My patience ran out! It was just too much noise and it was making me crazy.

So, I saw some suggestions here-specifically get up and go to the dog to correct them when they are barking. So I have been doing that, just walking up and touching them on their sides to get their attention. I thought maybe there was less barking, but I wasn't sure.

This morning, someone pulled into my neighbor's driveway (a trigger) and the dogs at the next two houses started barking (major trigger). The chihuahua didn't even come out of her bed, and the puppy laid in the doorway and watched (storm door) but neither of them barked.  

So to everyone here who takes the time to read and answer questions, thank you!! Your words are being heard and heeded!

edit: I realize now that in addition to going to the dogs to get their attention, I need to have them sit calmly and then reward them for that. Thanks to all of you who are helping me learn along the way rather than just being critical. "	t5_2r067	True

I have given it a lot of thought and have decided that I am going to give it a couple of months this summer to assess if Baloo is a good fit for me, and then try to find him a new home through a rescue if I am unable to make any progress. I contacted a hound rescue to ask for hound-specific tips on behavior and training, and [Hound Song](http://www.houndsong.com/) was very helpful with providing many tips and insight into what could possibly be causing his behavior.

My plan so far is to get him more stimulation through walks and more interesting toys. I have a few friends who have said they can help me with the walks on the days that I am too sick to do it, myself. For the aggression, I'm going to reevaluate how I correct him when he does something wrong and immediately start feeding them separately and keeping food put away so there's less fights. 

I really appreciate everyone's insight and suggestions, I feel a lot more empowered now that I understand better what could be causing his behavior.

So far, this past week, he's gotten into several scuffles with Lola. I've noticed that many of their scuffles start first with him standing very close to her body and staring at her. He doesn't growl or get mean with her, but the way he stands makes her very uncomfortable. If she starts growling, then he attacks her. It seems like he does this most often in the back yard, near the closet where I keep the food, and near his crate. The last time it happened, I didn't immediately jump in and grab his collar like I normally do, I told him to leave it and I grabbed the peanut butter I usually give him. I told him to go in his crate, then he looked at me and completely forgot about Lola and went into his crate and I gave him the peanut butter. I'm hoping that I can continue to use the ""leave it"" command to mean ""get out of Lola's space."""	t5_2r067	True

In terms of dog psychology, what is the best thing for a person to do to apologize/comfort for stepping on a dog's foot or tail on accident? It seems like dogs usually get that it was an accident, but sometimes they cry and look at you suspiciously and I don't want the dog to think badly of me. Do you pet them to reassure them, or give them space, or what?	t5_2r067	True

Comes when asked, and knows all his basic commands by heart. Now, when we go to the dog park, as soon as we get close Dutch (the beastmonster) gets over excited/anxious, starts whimpering wanting to get out of the car ASAP. By the time we open the door he's ready to burst out. Once he has dragged us inside the park he does not come back no matter what delicious treats we offer, how we call him/whistle.. or even if we step out of the park, Dutch does not try to follow us nor does he obey. 
If we go out jugging on a leash, he's fine. Sees another dog on the stree, fine too.  The only problem is when he's in a ""free"" environment. 

I would like to know if this has happened to any of you or if you have a suggestion on how to stop that kind of behavior.

1361009002.0	18mrza	Achievement Unlocked!	karmabook	33	6	22	"Update: Dog now sleeps each night in crate (8-10 hours) and I leave a few times a week for 4-8 hours no problems! 

I rescued a [puppy](http://imgur.com/a/iNnwY#0) who was constantly locked in a crate or dark closet for nights without being introduced properly.  He spent the nights (and as I was staying at the hostel I witnessed his cries) SCREAMING in full anxiety.  The solution by the family who found the dog was that if they would yell at him, scare him etc he would shut up for a few minutes.  The other solution was let him ""just get used to it"".  In other words, this tiny creature should spend a great percentage of his tiny life in sheer anxiety because you don't want to introduce him properly... it was sad.

This dog's constant practice of anxiety made him fearful of everything i the world and from 8-10 weeks spent much time hiding (by this time I had rescued him) under anything resembling safety and shelter, instead of exploring and greeting.  Any time I left even the room he would start screaming loudly in separation anxiety as if he was locked back in that dark closet.

I took him on puppy walks every single day and began to teach him his place, sit, stays, and fetch but eventually I knew I would have to deal with the separation anxiety.  I was out of money, no work, and when a job opportunity came I had to make the decision to turn it down because I couldn't ""force"" my puppy into the crate situation and separation situation without properly rehabilitating him, on my own (no money for trainers).

I scoured Reddit and dog blogs and came to the conclusion that it was just all about taking it VERY VERY VERY VERY slowly.  Allowing him only to be in for tiny incrementally longer times and make it very rewarding to be inside it.  He learned to love the crate but the real test was trying to leave.  

Finally I had to leave to go shopping, I was putting it off for far too long and had no food left in the house.  I just didn't want him to be left if he was not practiced to do it calmly but had only built up to 15 minutes at this point and had no choice.  I started audio recorder up on my PC to review what took place... utter failure.  He screamed and barked (new behavior) the whole time about an hour and a half.

It tore me up, I was angry and I felt trapped.  no money, unemployment is still not getting me by at all ($100/wk), and now it seemed I would have to give this pup up if I'm going to move on and get working.

Well I made the decision to tough it out, focus on the dog.  I started living still today off rice and potato and giant Walmart bags of frozen veg and chicken.  I'm not getting the nutrition I'm used to but I'm eating and was able to focus on dog rehabilitation.

Over the next few weeks and the next few recordings my work began to pay off.  A few times back I left for 3 hours and his SCREAM had been replaced by very mild whines that wouldn't even wake a baby.  A week ago I left him for a day trip to the museum, 4.5 hours.  He whined for the first hour continually but softly and gave up. 

Now tonight was the real treat and achievement unlocked... I left him in the cage for 4.5 hours again and the recorder shows NOT A SINGLE PEEP!

I am very proud of my little guy now 6 months old and getting to practice being all alone in peace instead of anxiety!  This means I will get to keep him and take him to Alaska for the summer so long as we can tough it out until May which I'll happily do."	t5_2r067	True

We recently (maybe two or three months ago) rescued a one year old pitt from a high kill shelter where she was about to be put to sleep. She clearly just had puppies, and with the horrific dog fighting issue in my city along with her many scars, I can only assume that she was a breeding dog, and either escaped or wasn't wanted anymore. 

Despite all of this, she was a total sweetheart when we finally got her back to the safety of our shelter. Up until about two weeks ago, she would curl up in your lap and snuggle the absolute crap out of you, give kisses, walk to the yard with no issues, and even did well with other dogs. Things changed pretty quickly. All of a sudden she is picking fights with other dogs in their cages every time I take her to go outside. She won't let you leave her cage once you're inside, and will resort to tugging on your clothing to get you to stay. Then, last week, she started biting people. People that have been taking care of her and loving her (as much as we can). She was fighting with another dog through its cage and when I tried to pull her away, she turned around an bit my stomach. She drew blood, but I was alright. The next day, she bit one of our adoption specialists in the face. She was alright too, although she was a little shaken up. Last night, she clamped down on another kennel worker's hand and would not let go. We are all nervous to take her outside now, which I'm sure doesn't help the situation.

 I just need some advice, what do you think started this? How can I help her? Our vet's (the guy who owns the shelter) policy is that if a dog is aggressive and attacks people, even though we are a no kill shelter, they must be put down. She is still sweet and loving when she calms down, but we are all nervous that she might do something awful. Please help!"	t5_2r067	True

New to the subject of reactivity? A reactive dog is one who displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, people, or other triggers. The most common form is *leash reactivity*, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

She has always been kind of a weird dog, and I'm wondering if she might be depressed or have some kind of anxiety disorder. She doesn't play with toys. At home she just lies on the floor looking sad or chews her bones. On our walks she seems hypervigulant and nervous. All day she is lip-licking, yawning, sometimes even whining. She also rarely eats all of her food. 

I need ideas to cheer her up and help her relax. I do bring treats on walks but she still seems nervous. We do loads of training, which she does well at, but this is a dog that rarely gets to have fun. When I try to play with her in the backyard she gets bored or tired after several minutes. The only time I've seen her happy is hiking with me off-leash, and we can't do that yet. Not for several months anyway. What do you suggest?

She'll take her toy and push it under the pen and then lay on her side and bat at it and try and get it out. The playpen (which often has baby in it) gets bumped and pushed and jiggled and I can't seem to get her to stop doing it. The other problem we have is when Lolli gets super excited (when my boyfriend comes home for instance) she'll wag her tail and circle him and bash into the playpen, push against it and otherwise jiggle my little one all over the place.

I can't seem to get her to stop and so now I've turned to Reddit. Anyone have any tips/tricks?

She's a doll! We had her in basic obedience class and she graduated with flying colors! We've come across some annoyances. When we take her outside to the bathroom she stares at us. She'll lock eye contact for +5 mins. We do not play with her in the fenced in back yard. I keep that space dedicated for her going to the bathroom so there's not a chance she would get distracted from going potty.

When I call her to me in the house she'll stay 20 FT away and stare at me. It's like a deer in the headlights look and she will not budge from eye contact or movement.

When I was trying to teach her to go in her crate she wouldn't even walk towards the crate to begin with even if I offer her her favorite treats. She just stares at me.

When I ask her to load into the car she tries to slowly inch further from the vehicle  and then cowers when we go to pick her up and let her in.

He turns two a month from now. He was born at the hoarder's, lived there until he was confiscated, spent four months at the shelter until the owner lost the court case and he was up for adoption and I brought him home. I don't crate him because despite working for a long time to get him to like the crate, he chews the bars and generally freaks out when I lock the doors, one day he managed to unbolt one of the locks and dragged the crate across the room trying to squeeze out. That was the last time I locked him up, it isn't worth him hurting himself...he really doesn't need the crate because he doesn't ever go to the bathroom in the house, and very, very rarely chews things. He exhibits some undesirable couch-destruction while I'm at work if I don't take him to the dog park to wear him out 3-4x per week, which is fine, I love the park as much as he does! I give him a busy bone, or chicken jerky stuffed in a kong or some other treat or toy when I leave, and he isn't allowed to go get it from his bed until I leave, so he doesn't stress at all when I leave, in fact, he stares at me like ""get out already!"" and I hear him jump off the couch and run to his bed to get the treat as soon as the door shuts.

The problem is, when I come home, he screams like a maniac and runs laps around the living room like a bat outta hell. He gets so worked up that he'll jump on the coffee table, bank off the back of the couch, etc. I work evenings at a restaurant, so sometimes I don't get home until after midnight, and I know my neighbor leaves for work at 6am, so I have to come up with a solution to get him to at least be quiet when I come home!

Things I've tried:

* Ignoring him when I walk in the door, for twenty minutes at a time. I did this for almost two months very soon after I got him and it only resulted in his screaming fit shortening in duration very slightly. Whatever ""success"" I had plateaued very quickly and I was forced to try another tactic.

* Giving him a job to do: asking him to go lay in his crate as soon as I walk in the door until he is calm, but his screaming starts when he hears me unlock the door, and he hasn't built any kind of association with me coming home and going in the crate, so basically, I can't get him to do this task before the screaming starts, so it is pretty much moot.

* Desensitizing him to my coming home. I've left and returned at varying intervals, but it is always the same. I can leave, walk ten feet away, then come back, and his spaz-out is still at about 80% of his normal intensity, like I've been gone for hours.

* It has gotten to the point where i feel like my only option is to give in and just pet him, which is the only way to quiet him, but only serves to reinforce his flipping out... Fortunately, my neighbor hasn't complained yet, but if she does, I'm not sure what I'll do. Plus I'm a real asshole if I let him continue to disturb everyone and nurture this undesirable behavior

I practice positive-reinforcement training, and *generally* ignore when he is exhibiting bad behaviors (with the exception of sometimes using *very* mild corrections when his behavior is too obnoxious to ignore, which is fortunately very rare). He is part pit bull and *super* sensitive to correction, so I avoid it because he freaks out and cowers like I'm going to beat the crap out of him if I even raise my voice. I did positive training from the start, but still used corrections pretty regularly until about two months ago when I cut those down to just a few times a week when he is really crazy and just needs a sharp ""no"" to get his attention, and our relationship has really, really, strengthened since then. His recall is way, way better, and our bond is envied by a lot of my acquaintances at the dog park.

Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do? Or experience with this kind of spazzing out? I think that, ideally, more of the same desensitization and ignoring would be the prescription, but I don't know how much more screaming he can do while I work with him, before my neighbor has had enough. I plan on talking to her next time I bump into her, apologizing and explaining that I am earnestly working on it, not just pretending everything is fine... I'm hoping someone has a better short-term solution... (Sorry for the wall of text, just trying to pre-emptively answer any questions/clarify the situation)"	t5_2r067	True

He hates his paws being touched. I have taught him shake to try and relieve the stress from that, and I'll lay him on the ground and just give him a ton of treats as I am messing with his paws. In the past he would scream and try and bite me when I would grab them. I don't grab them hard obviously, but sometimes if he gets something stuck in one, or I am clipping his toe nails I need to have a firm hold. I think he is improving on this with the treats while messing with his paws. 
Next is the scruff/collar. Sometimes at dog parks he will start playing a bit rough with a puppy, or start digging. He wont always recall when he is in this state of mind, so I have to grab his collar. He immediately turns around and bites my arm. Not hard, but the force of his teeth hitting my arm bones hurt and I don't want him to one day turn around and actually bite me. I really don't know how to break this habit. I have been told to bop him on the nose, but I really don't want to break his trust and make him worse off since he seems to be pretty sensitive already. 
Sorry for the long post, just don't know what to do.

1360536882.0	189s1j	Which puppy should I choose? ADVICE	chinese_frog	29	3	33	"I posted here because I am wondering which dog sounds like it would make the best pet and which dog a trainer would pick in terms of easiest to train.


Okay so I am fostering two puppies right now and I am going to keep one. There are a boy and a girl and I have no idea which one I should keep, which one will make the better pet. They are both about 5-6 weeks old and lab mixes.

The boy-Finn-Chubbier and more laid back, he loves to sleep and lay around. He will whine when left on my bed when he wants down. He doesnt run up to you when you enter the room or anything and he is really extremely low energy. He doesn't make a lot of eye contact the way the girl does, that was one of the first things I noticed, she will look you in the eyes to watch you and he doesn't although I've been rewarding eye contact. 

The girl-Marlowe-She is pretty laid back as well, neither of them are hyper jumpy puppies but she is definitely more likely to want attention. She's more likely to follow me around and will crawl up on my lap whereas he's fine sleeping anywhere. She's less timid than him. If seeing something new she is more likely to just watch and he might seem a little scared. When seeing a little kid on the beach she went right up to her and Finn was less aware. She also seems to learn a little more quickly but idk if maybe girls just mature faster? She also will watch you or look at your face it seems like and she sleeps less. She's definitely less laid back but seems smarter? Idk.

 At first I thought I would definitely pick her because she was making eye contact and quiet and he would whine and she just seemed to have a perfect temperment, now Im worried he would end up being a great laid back dog. But I really dont know. He's been better at potty training. Both have learned sit but she'll jump up more and he just sits there and stares.

Which dog would you choose? I really can't decide. 

Is the girl a better pic because she seems quicker to learn and more accepting of new situations or is he the better choice because he is calmer and more laid back?"	t5_2r067	True

I'm willing to consider such a toy if it will truly entertain him, but I'd prefer something I can use to serve him meals rather than treats (since we don't have kibble). 

**Maybe some of the ones I've considered will help others.** 


* He has this [Particleboard Seek A Treat](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RAtr3tBjL.jpg) which he loves, but while it slows him down it isn't much of a puzzle. He can finish it faster than I can serve my morning coffee.

* I thought the [Hide A Squirrel](http://gonetothesnowdogs.blogspot.com/2012/10/squirrel-vs-husky-product-review-of.html) would be an affordable, safe option, but in this woman's review she says it's not safe to leave alone with the dog. 

* I bought the [treat-dispensing Bob A Lot](http://www.amazon.com/StarMark-Bob-A-Lot-Interactive-Pet-Large/dp/B001JQLNB4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359660950&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bob+a+lot+treat+dispensing), but may return it because I thought I could open it up and clean it out and that's not the case.

* The [Kyjen puzzle toys](http://www.amazon.com/Kyjen-Dog-Games-Hide-Treat/dp/B0043A71PU/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359658969&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=puzzle) seem the most affordable, but since they're all on one page it's difficult to read reviews of individual toys. 

* I'm planning to buy him a [talking ball](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K83YJQ/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ACQWJPOCI39O7). 

Most of the puzzle toys are pricey and safety is an issue so whatever experience you can offer would be very helpful. Does anyone have recommendations for toys that they give to their dog when they leave the house?

1358396503.0	16qeah	We are so,so sad and looking for advice about the next step with our aggressive 9-month old puppy.	sacheltry	28	3	40	"I'm starting this out thinking this may be more of a catharsis than a question and I apologize for the crazy wall of text, but thank you in advance for reading.

We have a 9-month-old black lab-mix. We got her when she was about 4 months old. Her mom was a rescue and the day after the mom was rescued, she gave birth. We have one of her puppies.

Before we got her, my family and I did lots of research. My wife and I had previously had dogs, but it had been a while. My kids came home with books from the library and we watched Dogs 101, Ian Dunbar videos, etc.

When we selected our puppy, she was the one who kept coming back to us and she was the cutest and most loving puppy (actually all 11 were!). We decided as a family to get her, or she picked us.

We did crate training, attended puppy classes, found a great trainer (who was also great with the kids). However, we noticed that she had an aggressive streak. We first chalked it up to her puppy-ness but it was hard to get under control. There was resource guarding that was expanding, first it was an object, then larger objects, then it seemed to be the entire room. Also, during play, it would sometimes turn aggressive and scary.

We talked to our trainer and he had suggestions that we implemented. Frankly, there were some suggestions that I wasn’t so comfortable with and we started to look for another trainer.  We talked to other people with experience with dogs, lots of helpful replies from this subreddit, but it she still seemed to be getting scarier and more unpredictable.

Finally, last week, we called another highly recommended and certified trainer. He came over and saw how loving she was. He expected her to be cowering in the corner growling and snarling. He showed us some great new techniques, which she picked up within a few tries. What impressed me, but I don’t imagine it is a big deal to those reading this, was that she was able to sit on an apple box (20 x 12 x 8) with the trainer showing her just a few times — he was impressed. Only at the end of the hour-and-half session did she bare some teeth to him when he put her in her crate. He stood up, looked at her, and she backed down.

We kept a diary the week and sent it to the trainer. But then I was able to get two short videos of her playing with my son (about 9 years old). In the first one, my son is just sitting on the couch with her nearby. He goes to get up and she gives him the resource-guarding look. He calls me in. She bares teeth and snarls at me and back to him, my son is holding her leash the entire time. Then without warning (OK, the baring teeth was warning) she jumps up at him and grabs his arm, but she didn’t bite down. In the second video, again with my son, he is doing some training with her and having her jump over small hurdles. After the last one, she jumps up and starts biting him. That it happened to be my son is actually sort of irrelevant, as she seems to do this with anyone in the family.

Some of you might think that we have been abusive or using negative techniques or just don’t know better. Well I can say it is certainly possible that I don’t know better but we have certainly tried to know as much as we can. I don’t know many 9-year olds who talk about how important bite inhibition is, so I think we are pretty clear of children torturing the dog when the parents aren’t watching.

After seeing the videos, the new trainer has said that he is “seeing a strong precursor to a serious dog bite. II am sad to say that I feel she should be removed from your house in order to protect your family from an incident occurring.” The worst part of that is that I think I knew it was coming. I did talk to him and he was more convincing with specific details.

Tonight has been a terrible night of crying for my family. I thought I got it out of my system in the car before I got home, but seeing my kids eyes well-up and overflow with tears has been too much to bear (and it makes it hard to see the screen right now). We love her, have invested so much time, emotion, money (don’t care too much about that at this point) and ourselves that we don’t want to let her go. But within minutes of this discussion she was baring teeth at me for walking by her, when she didn’t have anything near her. It is pretty clear to my wife and me and even the kids (who know it but can’t say it) that she needs to be placed where we and she will all be safe and happy.

So here’s my question: what do you think is the best way to deal with this, on all levels? For example, once the trainer finds a place for her (he said he would help us through the process) do we drop her off? Should the kids go? Should she be picked up? Do we remove all the dog things from the house?

Do we get another dog? (My wife has already said she wants another one.) How long do we wait? Should we get another puppy or an adult?

I need still to talk to the new trainer (and some others), but what are the chances she is going to be euthanized? (I CAN""T BELIEVE I HAD TO WRITE THAT!) My wife said, ""she's just a baby!""

Or this: Do we keep her and keep trying other techniques?

Thank you for reading. I feel like I’ve already lost her and any insight and advice will be so very much appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you all for the supportive, caring and positive suggestions. I want to answer each of you, but this is getting overwhelming for me. So I am going to try and address some things here.
We have had her checked by two different vets and both say she is healthy and there are no signs of something going on. However, we haven't gone beyond that with blood testing and other diagnostics. 

The new trainer (certified, college-educated, gives talks and presentations) never left my kids alone with the dog or even suggested it.

The hurdle thing with my son was just us playing. She would just leap over the hurdles or go under them. She seemed to really enjoy it. We didn't pull her over the hurdles. He would just say 'Over' and point and she went. The problems has been that almost all the playtimes with her usually turns aggressive. My son (or any of us) never pulled, yanked or in anyway tried an aggressive move with her. The only times I may have was when she was going after one of us. Even in those situations,  I tried many times to turn away and ignore her so she wasn't getting attention for unwanted behavior. That is, until her biting was too painful for me.

Just got in touch with the rescue foundation we got her from. I am going to talk to them and with their trainer and see what they suggest.  

As much as we want to be and are a dog family, under no circumstances can I allow a potentially dangerous dog near my children, family or friends. I can accept that we cannot handle her. I also think that it isn't fair to the dog to be in a situation that is not healthy for her either. 

UPDATE: I spoke with the rescue people and she was great. They said they would take her back and do their best to find her a good environment. That we shouldn't worry about her being euthenized or harmed in anyway. She also said that given what I've told her of some of the techniques we were taught by one trainer, that we could have exacerbated her aggression. This wasn't accusatory and I happen to agree with her. She asked if we would be willing to meet with her trainer. Since this rescue shelter specializes in second chances, we are more that willing to give it a try. So I am waiting to her from their trainer and hopefully things will work out for the best.

I want to properly socialize my 1 year old pit/lab, but she gets so overly stimulated around other dogs that I can't get her to calm down enough to teach her how to greet other dogs properly. She has never shown any aggression, but if other dogs aren't interested in playing with her, she will continuously bark in their faces. I wish we could have worked on this in her obedience class, but they understandably kept the dogs separated and we weren't even allowed to let the dogs greet each other. 

My husband and I have tried several socialization sessions one-on-one with our friends who have dogs, and it always ends disastrously. We keep her on-leash but she goes completely nuts. She'll start crying and yelping, jumping, and straining at her leash (we've done our best to train her to loose-leash walk and stand).  She gets so excited to the point where food, her primary motivator, is completely ineffective, and she won't listen to any commands. 

How can we start to teach her to be calmer around other dogs? The best I've managed so far is getting her to sit and ignore other dogs when they walk by on the street (ok, so they have to be across the street...that's progress), but greetings are a disaster for me."	t5_2r067	True
1354210760.0	1403tb	My success with clicker training.  AKA thank you r/dogtraining for the great suggestions! (wall of text)	LostCrow	29	4	13	"So I have now had my dog Penny for a month a half.  She is a border collie/basset hound that I rescued from a nearby shelter and she is currently 7 months.  

When I first got her, I felt like I was in way over my head.  Every book you read, everything you think you know still does not compare to actually owning a dog.  Basically the first couple of weeks, she could not leave my sight because she would be chewing on things and wreaking havoc.  But she is a puppy and I understood that she didn't know any better.  That's when I turned to reddit and asked for help and tips and someone kindly suggest clicker training.  So i've been watching https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup videos and they have helped so much.  

Now Penny is an angel.  With clicker training, we do a five minute session about every other day and we started about a month ago and really got into it about two weeks ago.  In this short amount of time, I have been able to teach Penny the following tricks.

Sit:  She easily sits on command and she also knows that she has to sit when she meets new people and not jump up on them, and she has to sit in order for me to put her on her leash. 

Down:  She actually learned down very quickly.  She knows that if someone is in the kitchen and if she wants to be in there, she has to lay down and not to get in their way.  

Leave It:  I taught leave it so that she would stop walking away with my shoes and to teach her what she can and cannot chew on.  Now, I can put her favorite treat on the ground, tell her to leave it, and to follow me.  She keeps eye contact the entire time. 

Spin:  I taught her spin about 4 days ago and she picked up on it quick.  I simply flick my wrist tell her to spin, and she'll spin in place.  By far one of my favorite tricks that she does.

High Five:  We began working on this today and with just one session after she picked up the concept, she was able to high five my hand.  We will be working on this for the next couple of days so that I can throw in the word ""high five"" and so she can get it down really well.


So all in all, clicker training has been phenomenal.  It is by far the best method you could use with a dog.  r/dogtraining, I just wanted to thank you for all the help I've received.  And now Penny can impress my friends with the tricks that she knows.

New to the subject of reactivity? A reactive dog is one who displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, people, or other triggers. The most common form is *leash reactivity*, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!

1372233189.0	1h3gze	Off-Leash Charging Dog Rant	cwithay	29	4	55	"I've already seen a few posts about off-leash dog stories, but wanted to vent my story.

I adopted a shy dog who's making some great improvements. He's gotten to the point where he won't run away or growl at strangers anymore, and he'll even start greeting some calmer dogs when we're out on walks. I'm afraid that all that might have gone out the window when, during one of our walks today in our apartment complex, this medium-sized off-leash dog comes CHARGING at us at full speed barking, and my dog's freaking out, pulling every which way on the leash, and it was really difficult for me to get him away. My boyfriend, who was a little further down checking the mail, caught up with us and stepped in front of the charging dog right before the dog got to mine, and the charging dog's owner finally put a leash on him.

Doesn't end there. THEN! The other owner insisted the dogs were just trying to be friends. Here, WATCH. And goes around my boyfriend and puts his dog's face in front of mine, so my frantic dog bites his dog who yelps. Luckily, there was no wound or blood or anything except for the other dog finally stopped trying to get at my dog. The owner just laughed and told ME not to worry, he won't blame my dog like it was entirely my fault. I was so angry but had to get my growling pulling dog out of that situation and as far away from them as possible.

I haven't encountered another stranger or dog yet in the walks after this, so I'm not sure if my dog's ok or if all that training and hard work was all for nothing, but I'm still really frustrated with this whole situation and wanted to rant.

Now that I'm a little calmer [sort of], I was thinking of how I could have handled the situation differently. My dog IS small enough that I could have pick him up eventually, but he was tugging and running around, so it was difficult in the short amount of time I had. Any advice or tips for next time?

TL;DR I'd very much like to slash someone's tires.

1357584239.0	164ryy	at the Dogpark today, there was a fight, advice and perspective desired.	arosebyanyname	28	4	54	"Dear reddit dog-training. I had a dog park incident, this is kinda a story but I want to give details. 

I was a the dogpark with my 10 month rescued Belgian Malinoi. I have not had this problem before at the dog park.

There was a smaller younger dog, maybe half his size. She was barking and growling and aggressively-playing every dog she met, even if they hid under the picnic table from her. Her growls sounded (to me) to be aggressive, but her owner assured us all that she was just playing and wasn't hurting anyone because 'no one was screaming'.

Everyone else thought that was cool, I guess.

My dog likes to fetch, and usually he doesn't have any competition. There was a lab there that gave him a good run, they had a tug of war and growl over the Frisbee once, but me and the other owner were there and it never escalated, they were able to play fetch together without any problems really. But it was perhaps not a good first impression for the other people.

Back to little dog, my dog and little dog were  drinking water together, I was right there, they were sharing just fine till little dog got growly and I'm pretty sure nippy. So they had a small tussle which I broke up. (In retrospect I should have left at this point.) 

So my dog has a Frisbee-ish toy, he is sitting on his own in the shade resting nearby me.  The little girl dog comes over and starts tugging at the toy. He is sitting there, not moving from his ground or even pulling back. His ears are down, hair is down, he's pretty passively allowing her to tug. Then *She* gets growling, (her owner starts to get worried about my dog who is doing nothing. She walks toward the dogs but doesn't do anything to remove her dog from the situation) *she* stars baring her teeth, I stand up to get closer to the situation, and suggest to her owner that *her* dog is the one growling. My dog drops the toy. He is lying down at this point, still with no hair raised. little dog moves toward him, he barks she pauses. Then she moves toward him and he barks, she pauses. Then she goes at him and they fight.

I break it up and sit with my dog by the tree. He seems calm despite the incursion. Then someone mentions that we should go and my dog is 'pushing all our buttons', so I do.

I was honestly Surprised, my dog was not the instigator of either situation. The smaller dog was not admonished nor asked to leave, though she displayed much more aggressive behavior the entire time she was there.

Is it because of my dog breed or size or appearance?

I'm not sure that I can/should train my dog to just *ignore* another dogs aggression.

I *do* need to teach him to share the toys better, but he was sharing just fine and I'm pretty sure it was the other dog who's energy escalated. 

Maybe I should not bring him to the dogpark, I want him to be socialized, but I suppose it is a gamble as to who else will be there and how well trained.

Or maybe I should just leave if I see another dog that could be problematic or an owner who is uncomfortable. (This is what retrospect is telling me I should have done)

Or maybe it is me and a fault in my training with him. I do not want to blame the other dog entirely, or unjustifiably. If you think this is the case, any suggestions?

Thanks."	t5_2r067	True

Any tips on which blind dog command we should start training with?	hubb	26	0	9	"So yesterday was horrible. Pixel was hit on her head, losing 1 eye and she is now blind on the other. That drive to the emergency vet were the worst 10 minutes of my life. Tomorrow the lost eye will be surgically removed and closed. Today my fiancee has been rigging our house out with foam padding on all sharp corners, tables etc. We also bought a runner carpet that we've put in the hallway, so she can navigate between our bedroom and the living room. I read somewhere that blind dogs react very well on clicker training, which we have no experience with. We think we should start with 'wall' or something, but we're very curious what r/dogtraining suggests.

My wife and I love him, but he's incredibly territorial though not impolitely so. He will not allow touching by strangers but has always been loving and great toward us. His behavior's pretty obviously highly anxiety-driven...other animals present means he goes immediately into attack mode. Foreign people in the house get him quite jumpy and he loves to nip at heels. The behavior seems much more anxiety-induced than naked aggression. 

Unfortunately at about 8 years old, he developed melanoma in his toe. We had the cancer successfully removed (the toe was removed)...but ever since I took him to the vet I'm now persona non grata.

After much consideration and thought, my husband and I are deciding that we might get a puppy, probably a Japanese Spitz. We dogsat one for about a month which helped me understand how much care they require on a daily basis (minus the vet trips), but he was a couple months old so he was already potty trained and all. 

This is my first pet, I was raised in a ""no pet"" house as a kid, so I don't really know anything about training him. My husband has had dogs and is familiar with it, but I want to be ready, too, especially since I'll be the one home with him most of the time and be training him. 

Are there any books you can recommend for me to read on training a puppy/dog? I have taken a look at the sidebar links both here and in /r/Puppy101 and I bookmarked some of them - I have heard lots of good things about clickertraining. 

If it's relevant - we don't have any other pets that we need to be worried about him getting along with immediately, nor children, and we don't plan on ever having kids (though I understand that a dog needs to learn how to interact positively with other animals and kids). I'm looking for more on the basics of training him. Thanks so much for your time.

If I am trying to sleep and my SO is trying to sleep he will jump up on the bed and try licking our privates through our clothes. This is an on going thing, he also gets hard, which I thought wasn't really a thing until they were at least 6-8 months old. He hasn't started humping yet. If someone sits on the couch, he will immediately jump up and try licking their crotches, especially if its some one where shorts or a skirt, mainly females, if he can't reach the vagina he will frenziedly lick the inside of their thighs to the point where I have to tear him off. Last night even though I was pushing him away, he was persistently pushing through my advances and trying to lick my V while I was trying to get comfortable in bed to the point where I had to start kicking him away from me (I'm a victim of sexual abuse, and the forced way he comes at me causes a lot of fear and panic in me) and even though I was kicking him and yelling for him to STOP he was still pushing through and trying to get to me until I really hauled off and got him with the heal of my foot in which he just laid at the end of the bed and huffed. He does the same thing to guys, and we literally have to peel him off because nothing else works and most the time he runs right back and we have to cage him, I can't distract him, I can't clicker him, I can't go ""EH!"" like I could with biting, he doesn't bite btw, I can't tell him to stop, which he always listens to in any other situations, my only option as I see it is to cage him for eternity so he isn't near us, but that doesn't seem fair.

I really don't know what to do, I've never seen a puppy or a dog that was that interested in human genitals and to that ferocity! Will he grow out of it?

1372341341.0	1h6f1r	Disciplining a sensitive puppy; my lessons learned	hastiepen	28	7	7	"Hello /r/dogtraning

I thought I would share my experiences of training my puppy, as it might be useful to some other owners. This kind of technique will not work on all dogs, especially if they are very excitable and prone to ignoring their owners.

I have a five month old whippet puppy ([Oblig pic](http://imgur.com/oqTxl42)) who, of course, is the best dog in the world etc etc fill half a page with praise

When we got him, we started off training him to be the dog that we need him to be, using typical positive reinforcement techniques  much as possible. He's our first puppy, so we've made mistakes naturally, but overall I'm very pleased with how he's turned out. 

The biggest problem we've had with him is disciplining him when he's being naughty , such as jumping on people, jumping on the table, trying to get in the kitchen drawers for his treats. We were having a real problem at one point when he kept peeing on the floor. Back then (wow was it only a few weeks ago?!) we were pretty much constantly saying ""No!"" To him, almost every few seconds, trying to teach him not to do things.

One day, we had a breakthrough. My husband told him ""no!"" in a very firm (read: loud) voice. Mercury's reaction? He barked at my husband, ran away and peed next to the door. We realised that we were going about this all wrong. Mercury *hates* being shouted at. He hates us raising our voices even a little bit. He's really sensitive to negative behaviours on our part.

We finally found a way to discipline him without making it a negative thing. When he puts his paws on the table, or starts chewing on my shoes or doing something that we dont want him to do, we tell him ""naughty!"" in a bright cheerful tone, the same way as we would if we were asking him to sit or come. We correct him, praise him and carry on with our day.

He still tries reaching up onto the table, but now when we tell him ""naughty"" he gets down pretty quickly and gets smothered in praise and hugs. We still have accidents, he's still learning what to do and what not to do and we're still learning to be good dog owners, but on disciplining him, we've turned it into a positive thing which leaves us feeling a lot better about the whole thing!

I hope this anecdote will be useful to other owners with sensitive dogs :)

TLDR: use positive training to discipline a sensitive dog: tell him ""naughty"" instead of ""no"" in gentle tones, correct and praise him for stopping doing the naughty thing."	t5_2r067	True
1370648615.0	1fwak0	So we're going to foster a ~3 year old stray that has, as far as we've been told, NEVER had owners - HELP!	walaska	28	5	9	"Hi! Long-time reader first time poster.

In 2 weeks this fluffy [ball of fur](http://www.helpinganimalsromania.de/hunde/r%C3%BCden/quento/) is hopefully going to be arriving at our apartment (!).  They found him in the parking lot of a supermarket in Romania with a terrible bite-wound, so the first thing they did was pick him up and take him to the vet's to fix him up and castrate him. Locals indicated that he's been there for at least 2, maybe 3 years, living alone.

This arrival is all very recent and he's suffering terribly in the conditions they're keeping him in down in Romania, so he's an emergency foster situation we couldn't refuse especially since no one else seems to have answered the call.  We don't have any other dog in our apartment, but I'm struggling to think of somewhere that can be ""his"". A crate seems like a good option since he doesn't seem to hate being in a cage too much, but this might be due to his character.

Apparently, he let's anyone do anything to him. He let them pick him up when he was injured, he likes getting stroked but he seems generally apathetic to things around him. It could be related to his sickness and when he gets fit he'll be fine, but I must admit I'm a little worried about training him because he's not overly responsive to stimuli.  My best guess at the moment is that, as a former stray, high-value food will be a great reward for him, so hopefully that's the case. 

I suppose in America it may not be not overly common for ""real"" strays to be found very often, but I might be completely wrong and you guys import them like we do here in Austria.  Dogs that have lived their lives on the streets of a capital, like Bucharest, can be notoriously stubborn and independent, which is fine, but I'd love to turn this li'l fella into a real heart-throb with a ""forever home"" in the near-ish future.  

Anyway, if you have any suggestions on how to prepare for such a fearful little arrival, I'd be all ears.  Thanks in advance!

1366406382.0	1cp8gg	Awesome dog that loves to kill....	Kamanu	25	2	12	"I have a hound mix that I picked up from the shelter about six months ago.  He's probably one of the most incredible dogs I've ever owned.  Very trainable, very friendly, and very obedient. I have a goose that likes to bite his tail and and ears, and he just looks at me obediently.  I can spread chicken feed literally around his feet and have them peck at it, and he won't even look at them.  I have two other small dogs who might chase a wild rooster through the yard, and he won't take part.  

However, as soon as I leave him alone, everything changes.  He has killed 15 ducks and chickens over the past few months.  He killed my neighbors baby goat (the goat wandered onto our property before we had a fence).  He killed our rabbits.  I have a fence with barbed wire (4.5') separating the ducks/chickens and he still seems to be able to jump it if he's extremely excited.  The catch is, I've never seen him kill anything or even look aggressive (except once).  The only way I know that it's him who's done the killing is that I've come home and found him in the chicken/duck fence or seen his pawprints in the mud.  My wife came home once to find him chewing on our live rooster   

While he generally will listen no matter how high his excitement level, the one act of aggression that I did witness from him was when he took down a feral pig with a pack of hunting dogs that came through my property (before we had a fence).  No matter how insistently I called for him, there was no way he was going to let go of the pigs face. He's also chased feral pigs at night and coming back with large gaping gore wounds.  

And this is from a dog that is literally the most docile I've ever had.  I come from an area that has lots of stray hunting dogs.  So, there is a fair chance that he was trained to take down pigs.  

I fenced in our 1.5 acre property so that he can't go chasing pigs or kill our neighbors goat.  I've never seen him get out, but he has jumped the fence into the duck pen (so I know he has the ability to jump it).  

My only solution has been to tie him up when we leave.  I hate to do it, but I have no other choice.  

Things I've tried:
I bring him into the duck/chicken fence (.5 acres) when I'm working in there or feeding them.  Initially I would have him on a leash and I'd wait for him to get excited.  It never happened.  So I kept upping the ante by trying to get him excited (putting food on his feet, throwing food so the ducks had to fly to get it, etc).  Nothing works.. He really won't even glance at them while I'm there.  I can work for hours inside the fence with him off leash (with a shock collar, just in case) and he won't chase them.  

So, how do I fix a problem that I can never see?  

 (sorry for the long post, i just figured the more details the better, and thank you in advance for any info.  I've spent a fair amount of time online looking for advice, and it's hard to find any for an animal that doesn't react when I'm around.) 

Edit* I imagine that the number one advice will be to reinforce our fence.  TThe occasional duck can fly out (clipped wings, but they grow back) and we have plenty of wild chickens around.  The fence is a deterrent, but I really need to try and stop the problem.  Hiring a professional trainer is definitely an option for me as well.  Just not sure it's fixable at all?"	t5_2r067	True

My wife and I have had dogs our entire lifes, we even spent a couple years fostering for a local rescue organization, we've been through training courses at big box stores as well as local courses, so overcoming behavior obstacles is nothing new to us.


**Scarlett**, 2 year old 25# Australian Shepard mix- likes to assert her dominance by grabbing ahold of the others collars, thus chewing them to bits. Also has destructive chewing problems when she gets bored, shes an incredibly smart dog and has no problem playing fetch with herself.


**Charlie**, 3 year old 25# pug mutt- marks everything and will join the chewing party Scarlett starts. Wearing a belly band prevents this but Scar tears it off him.

**Vincent**, 4 year old 25# Puggle- also marks on occasion to assert his dominance, will shit on the floor of the laundry room if he isn't left a dog bed, will shit on the couch if he's left out and the other 2 are in their crates, will also join the chewing party once Scarlett starts


Last night they destroyed a new Kong crate pad that was being used as a bed in 15 minutes.


The short answer- **a 36"" crate that all 3 of them snuggle up together in fixes most issues**, because they just chill together at night and when we're at work, but we have a very small house and would prefer to let them have the ceramic tiled launry room to themselves so they aren't so cramped and we don't loose floor space to a crate, and can have a nice dog bed and a couple toys to stimulate them through the day.


In trying to leave them out of the crate and gated in to the laundry room we have lost 3 dog beds, and Scarlett has chewed through 2 plastic gates. Vincent will shit on the floor if there isn't a bed there and Charlie marks all over the room.


Am I missing something obvious or are they just going to have to deal with being crated up?

I found his group in the bargain trader and drove out to see them. When I got there he was in a pen outside with a heap of other dogs. His hair was matted in feces and he was very sick in the corner to the point he could barely walk. The other dogs were stepping on him and acting aggressive towards him. When I first saw this place I couldn't stand it and didn't want any of the dogs since they all looked awful but I just felt so bad for him that I paid the woman 500 bucks to get him out of there. I took him to the vet and had to get him special food because he had starved to the point he could not eat dry kibble. They also told me the woman had given him so many drugs it had made him very sick. Eventually working with the vet and all my savings he got healthy. I've had him for 8 months now and he is a happy healthy dog. The problem is he HATES people and dogs.

When it's just me and him at home he is wonderful. He listens to everything I ask him to do and he is very loving and sweet. But whenever I try to have a friend come over he goes crazy and barks non stop and charges at them or trys to bite them. He runs around the house and takes all the socks/shoes and his toys and puts them on his food bowl. He will then sit on top of the food bowl and bark at my friend until they leave. Even if it's for hours, he will not stop at all. He also will charge out at them every few minutes and then retreat back to the food. He does the exact same thing to dogs as well. If he gets the chance and I'm not paying attention he will and has bitten people. 

I've tried letting my friends feed him and pet him. I've had them over lots to try and get him used to the same people but he just doesn't let his guard down. Even after months of seeing them 2 or 3 times a week. Other than that I tell him No! and have tried putting him in time outs but he just sits in the cage and barks his head off/growls the entire time. Even if we cover the cage with a blanket. 

When he first started getting healthy I was taking him for walks regularly and he does the same thing at people walking by us or driving by. I finally got so embarrassed of telling people 'No no! please stay back' every time they wanted to socialize with me that I have discontinued walking the dog permanently. Everywhere I go he makes me feel so embarrassed and I feel like his behavior is a reflection of how terrible I am. My friends don't want to come over any more and if I ever go out they make sure to remind me not to bring the dog. I love him so much but I don't know what to do anymore. He makes me so upset and ashamed. Thank you. Sorry for my grammar/spelling I know it's terrible. 

Edit: Thank you all for your responses! I'm reading the pages you linked and I'm going to work on doing what I can from home. I'm also going to pick up the books that have been recommended. Although I'm not sure I can afford a trainer at the moment I will start to save up. Thank you so much!

She is an amazing, sweet dog, but has a horrible case of separation anxiety. I have gone to the vet and she is on a few medications for her anxiety.  She seems to enjoy stuffed kongs, she has 3 in with her right now. The problem is that I live in an apartment and when I leave for school, she barks nearly the whole time (which can be up to 6 hours).  My neighbors have complained and the apartment has talked to me about her.  They say that it isn't an issue if I am trying to fix the issue, but I still want her to be ok.

-stuffed kongs

-DAP diffuser

-DAP collar

-Play music while I am gone

-tennis balls to chew on

-Doggie Prozac

-Anti-anxiety pill I give her 1/2 hour before leaving

1352398094.0	12v8e1	UPDATE: Introducing aggressive female pit-bull to large, dominant male lab	canmoredan	29	6	6	"Here's the original thread where I was looking for some advice: http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11cpu8/advice_on_introducing_a_large_alpha_male_to_a/

So, it's now a month later, and we've introduced the dogs.  Long story short, there's been no bloodshed and things have gone very well.  I'd like to thank those that gave some advice in that thread, we've integrated several of the tips with great success.  We prefixed their meeting by exchanging some smelly blankets a couple of weeks before hand, to familiarize each with the others scent.

We met in neutral territory, with both dogs on lead.  As expected, my lab showed very little interested in the pit, but she was very keen on sniffing/approaching him.  I walked him down the trail, and my GF followed with her dog wanting very much to sniff at mine.

After 10 minutes or so of this, we let her get close enough to get a good butt sniff.  He stopped and looked at her, peed on a tree, and she immediately had to follow suit.  In the meantime, he had wandered off down the trail.  She seemed to feel compelled to follow.  She now pees wherever he does, it seems very important to her.

And that's pretty much it.  She was immediately happy to walk along side him.  He grumbled at her when she licked at his face and she immediately backed off, but other than that, he ignored her.  She tried to initiate some play with him (bowing, dancing around him barking, etc), but he didn't acknowledge her at all.  She eventually gave up and started exploring around.

It was a very informative weekend for learning about some of her triggers.  It's been very difficult to find people and space to work with her.  I have several friends here in town that own dogs that were keen to meet her, and were willing to try some different things.

Her biggest trigger for aggression is people and dogs approaching directly in front of us.  Over the last few days, we've successfully introduced her to people and dogs (keeping a loose, but very short leash) by meeting them at an angle and walking parallel for a while.  This seems to interest her, but not trigger the aggressive response.  After a short time of doing that, she's happy to walk right alongside relatively new people.  The odd treat from the newcomers doesn't seem to hurt either.  We feel like we've learned a lot about what it is that sets her off and it's giving us something more precise to work on.

My GF is away for a week and I'm looking after both dogs.  They're sharing the same space with no problems.  He's growled at her a few times if she's approached something that he appears to be ""claiming"" (bed space, etc).  I've kept all toys out of sight for the duration.  She's responded with submission and seems to be learning his boundaries quite quickly.  She doesn't seem afraid of him, but seems to respect the lines he's drawing.

While out walking, he often grabs a long stick and walks with it in his mouth.  She has tried to grab the stick a few times and has been met with growling, and the odd bark if she doesn't back down.  As soon as she backs off, he returns to what he was doing.  She has responded with surprise and submission every time so far, and it's happening less and less (she's not trying to take his sticks any more).  This is pretty much the same pattern as he's established with other dogs that we spend time with.

Overall, she seems much calmer when in his presence.  She's often triggered to aggression by the approach of other people or dogs.  However, there have been a few surprises when she's simply followed my big guy, walking calmly past situations that would often create what we call the ""shark on a rope"" situation.

Her recent history doesn't contain much other dog-on-dog socialization, because of her aggression.  I have hopes that his general calm demeanour is going to have an affect on her.

In addition to this, we've found a trainer in Coeur d'Alene that's prepared to work with her (after a couple of ""sorry, I can't work with this dog"" responses), and we're going through a rigorous 10-week obedience training course aimed at older dogs with behavioural problems.  It's only 1 week in, but she's picking up the training very quickly.

My GF was feeling trapped for quite a while, unable to do many of the things she wanted to do with this dog.  Things are looking very positive!

I took him to the ASPCA, got him all fixed up, and brought him home. We got over some serious separation anxiety issues in the first 6 months- he went from not being able to be in a room by himself to loving his crate and spending my work day in the house alone without damaging anything. Since then we've moved around to a few places, I even had to leave him at my Mom's house for about a year while I was in school.  He's never lived in the same home/ with the same family for more than 3 years straight.  I know that I have failed to offer a consistent lifestyle for the little guy, but over all he's been happy and healthy, walked and fed.

Here is where I need advice.  About 2 months ago I moved in with my girlfriend, and my dog moved from my mother's house to mine.  We live  in a pretty spacious 2nd floor apartment, less than a block from a huge dog park that he visits at least twice a day.  He has become much more social with other dogs and is getting more exercise than ever before- his fur is even softer and he's seemingly doing better than he ever has.  Except he's not my dog anymore.  He's attached tomy girlfriend's hip, and ready to defend her at the drop of a hat.  I've now grown accustomed to a growling dog sitting in my spot on the bed if I get up to pee in the middle of the night.  When I tell him to ""get in his house"" he growls and barks and runs back and forth between his crate and my bed.  Last night as I got out of bed to pee I tripped over a trash can making a good bit of noise, he was at my face ready to fight.  When I escorted him out of my bedroom it was nothing but teeth and snarly noises.  He'd never shown me his teeth before.  I am at a complete loss.  We are the best of friends until she comes home from work.

**TL;DR: My dog moved in with my girlfriend and I, now he's her dog not mine.  I feed him, we both walk him, we both play with him.  When she's not around he's the same old dog, when she comes home he doesn't know me any more.  Advice please.**"	t5_2r067	True

At night he will want to play, but he tries to play by grappling my legs and arms like he is mounting me, body slamming against me, and biting. The biting is increasing in strength which is a huge concern.

I have tried switching to toys or training sessions (with mixed success), crating him or putting him out for a few minutes (which fails, because he starts right back up when let out/in), water, and simply leaving the room. 

Leaving the room is the hardest because I am basically dragging the dog with me. Kinda makes it hard for a grand exit so to speak.

I know the traditional answer is play with the dog more. He gets LOTs of play, attention, and walks. During the day.

The problem is that I work nights, so he recharges while I am at work and I live in the country so its too dark to walk the woods or play Frisbee when I get home."	t5_2r067	True

My other half and I adopted an 18 month old Lab/Beagle cross about a year ago from the rescue centre and he has been perfect in every way. We got a second dog from the rescue centre 2 weeks ago. He is a collie crossed with god knows what - I suspect German Shepard with some husky / malamute in there somewhere. He is perfect with the first dog - they play together, are really starting to bond, are sharing toys, no fighting over food, no attempts to establish dominance.... just perfect. The new dog is also fantastic with us, very loving, in 2 weeks has learnt to sit, stay, to take food gently, to give his paw, to lay down, to wait, etc. Its basically perfect... except one problem which came to a major head yesterday.

I live in a block of flats / appartments. Whenever the new dog is within the communal areas of these flats, walking from mine to the garden or carpark etc, if he sees someone else who lives in the block of flats he will bark at them. Its easy enough to snap him out of it, just establish that ive seen the person, stand between him and the person and tell him no and he shuts up. He also does it when he is in the car (we drive him upto the woods every day for a long run) - I think he also views the car as his territory. He barks at everyone in his territory, but not too badly - women not much atall, but men, specially men in hoodies, he goes crazy at.

However, yesterday we were going through a door and I foolishly let him walk through first, and immediately on the other side was someone who lives in another flat who was coming in the opposite direction. The dog was startled as clearly he didnt expect someone to be immediately at the door just a foot away from him, so he lunged and bit the guy on the arm. Thankfully he had a thick hoodie sweater on (probably why the dog picked fight over flight due to my theory about his past) but even through this sweater his skin was grazed - if he had a short sleeve on I am sure it would have broken the skin.

This is absolutely not acceptable. I know that I should have gone first, I know that I messed up, and I know that the dog has had a 'really' shitty start in life which is why he is particularly afraid of men. I am sure it was the flight or fight instinct kicking in, combined with some terrotorial dominance.... but either way, I cant have this happening. Thank god the guy in question is a nice guy and a friend and totally understands its a new dog which is somewhat unpredictable who has had a rough start who is trying to be put right - if it was someone less understanding then I dread to think of the consequences.

He was immidiatly disaplined - in the heat of the moment, pulling him back on the lead, we yelled probably more than we should, but he certainly got the message and for the rest of the day he was very subdued. Being responcible, now we know there is a potential issue,  he now wears a muzzle when going through the communal areas and I have made some phone calls to some local dog behaviour experts as well as the rescue center to get some advice.

I really turn to you guys for some help and advice. I am a responcible owner, we have had many dogs over our lives, and this has never been a problem. I can controll the barking / aggresion in the predictable areas and am confident that we can get this out of him - but I am concerned that should he ever be in a position of fear again (like he was with the guy being right on the other side of the door), his natural instincts will always be to fight rather than run.... and Ive no idea how to program that out of him as how can you setup and stage such an incident?

Sorry for the long post, as you can probably tell this is very much on my mind as a huge issue - he is such a wonderful dog in every way and he gets on with our other one so well and if we can just fix this then it will all be perfect, but I am so afraid that if we cant fix it, even being responsible, then he may have to go and that fills me with dread.

1367191812.0	1dauv7	Prey Overdrive	gunder_bc	22	2	20	"stats: female, spayed, boxer mix.  3yo.  Rescued ~New Years.

I'm starting to get pretty concerned about my Lola's prey drive.  Walks are a constant scan for squirrels, cats, and other small, fuzzy critters.  I literally have to pull her away from the scene if she actually sees one.  She'll plant herself firmly, such that when I lean in and pull her away, she'll rear up on her hind feet and be walked backwards.  It takes a good half-block before she'll stop trying to go back, and for the next 5 mins or so, she's in constant high-vigilance scan mode.

That alone is ... annoying.

But recently she's decided small dogs are also prey.  I tried a dog park a couple times - first time was spectacular.  Second, not good.  Someone brought a very small, blind (both eyes missing) dog and Lola immediately showed a great deal of interest.  Pretty quickly she just tried to eat the little dog.  It wasn't aggressive - no growling or barking, heck, her tail was wagging most of the time.  We separated them and left immediately after exchanging contact info and I picked up all the vet bills for the owners.  We've not gone back (nor will we, I think).

Since then, any little dog needs a wide berth - Lola will go into her alert stance (planted front legs, weight forward, head and ears up, tail up) and if they get too close, she just goes to get them.  Today there was a close call when we had to pass right by each other (hiking in the woods) and the owner picked up the other dog.  Lola tried to jump on them and take the dog out of their arms.  Needless to say, this is quite upsetting to everyone (except Lola...), and since I took to kneeling down and hanging onto Lola's harness and collar to let smaller dogs pass.

I really don't like having to do that, nor having to worry about small dogs - earlier today there was a loose chihuahua in the neighborhood (looks likely to have escaped someone's yard - had a choke-collar and tag, but never got close enough to read it so I could call).  It took us a good 10 mins to get past and I was worried on more than one occasion that it would end badly.

I'm working constantly on attention and focus games, but as soon as she spots something she thinks is prey, her focus is gone over to that entirely.

Muzzles are an option but I'm loath to have to go to that.  The assumption when people see a muzzle on a dog is that it's dangerous to everyone/everything.  She's generally a super sweat heart to people.  Gets along pretty well with dogs her size, too.  Heck, she's in a mixed group for dog walks (and yes, I've told the dog walker about all the incidents) and gets along fine with the smaller dogs in there.  

**TL;DR**: Dog is very prey driven, and has recently decided little dogs are prey, too.  It's getting to be a problem.

Any thoughts?  I'll keep up with the focus games, and I try to keep my walk schedules offset slightly from when most people seem to be walking other dogs in the area.  But I'm starting to think she's just always going to want to hunt and kill, and I'm always going to have to give small dogs a wide berth and be on alert myself for them.

I'm talking about growling that elevates to snapping that elevates to biting. Often happens [when I try to groom his face](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1a7ct9/is_it_ok_to_hold_a_dogs_mouth/) or when I pick him up to put him in his playpen. 

Well, it's getting worse. He bites more and more often now. There are little cuts all over my hands. Been a regular on this forum, reading positive reinforcement books, watching the videos in the sidebar...but apparently I suck at this. I'm so scared he'll bite someone and frankly it hurts my feelings when he attacks me. He just bit me a few minutes ago and I put him in his pen and told him to go fuck himself, tears streaming down my face. I feel like I've adopted a domestic abuser. Minutes after I put him in his pen, he's all ""*baby, baby, I didn't mean it! I lurve you! Come over here and let me lick your face. We don't need this ~~restraining order~~ play pen. I just wanna be by your side, baby*

He's not a nervous or insecure dog. 

Please don't say, ""Oh, well train him to like getting picked up"" because that's not going to solve the problem--as soon as I try to get him to do something else he doesn't like, he'll be biting me for that. 

Some people say when he growls I have to respect him and back off, as after that warning he will always bite. But then other people say, I can't let him get what he wants or he'll learn that biting works. These two pieces of advice are both rational, but contradictory. So which is it, doggit?

Outside, however, he's a completely different dog. He does loose leash walking, and that's the extent of his listening.

We got her when she was 4 months old from a pet store (I know, bad plan...puppy mills and all that...anyway)...she has been SO slow to potty train and I have posted here a number of times looking for help.  The advice was great (and reinforced what I had already researched) but the going was slow.

We decided to start using the bells on the door.  For 2 months we rang them every single time we went out to go potty in conjunction with the potty command.  The first time she rang the bells was right *after* she peed by the door.  The next couple times were sporadic at best, and not always *before* she had to go.  Then one day, she rang to go out and actually peed!  Then later that day, she did it again 2 more times!  (Big rewards and loves were had).  Since then, she has had very few accidents!  

We are just now experimenting with giving her a wee bit more freedom...I got another set of bells and hang them over the side of the gate wherever we are sectioned off at.  She has been using them to let me know that it's time to go out.  We have also moved the gate so that she has access to the bells on the door and she has used them as well.  :)

I can't believe she is finally getting it and I am super excited that it won't be *too* long before she can be ""free"" in the house and not tethered to me the whole time or gated in or crated when I can't watch her.  

TL;DR - thanks for all the advice and encouragement to just hang in there and be patient.  Leeloo is finally getting potty training!

My sweet darling pitbull Dublin and i have been working to train him well enough to pass the test for him to be my service dog.  He is VERY gentle, loving and the LEAST aggressive DOG i have ever seen regardless of breed(doesnt even bark when someone is at the door, and was attacked twice at the dog park and just sat there looking at me doing nothing)  When i realized i had such a gentle giant i figured he would do GREAT as my Service dog.



I am a disabled Vet, and have wanted a service dog to help me pick up things that fall, or to help me up if i were to fall.  He fits the bill in the size dept(@10 months he is 60 lbs and very tall and lean looking) and is certainly gentle enough to be in public.....



Only thing is this.... there are 10000000000's of places that seem willing to take my money and send me a fancy vest.....but dont even talk about taking the obedience test or anything.  
So where do i go to test him?  How do i know i the REAL place.  How many REAL places are there.   Lastly,  Is it true that once  he has his vest NO ONE can tell me i cant bring him places, and that i cant be discriminated against when looking for a new home etc?

Whenever I can think of a positive method to train him, he responds well, and I would like to stay positive only, but this problem is testing me. He is crate trained, and likes his crate, although is sometimes reluctant to go in if he thinks we are leaving. He is a whiny dog in general (when he wants attention, or very occasionally wants food we have), which we have been very careful to NEVER reward...this hasn't gotten better or worse, but is manageable. 

What is not manageable is the fact that he escalates his whines into barking and yelping and howling in his (downstairs) crate whenever I am walking around upstairs in my bedroom or bathroom, and this continues until he sees or hears me come downstairs. He is very well exercised (lots of playing fetch every morning, long walks, etc., so he naps a lot), and I work from home so he gets plenty of attention and love. It is not separation anxiety since it doesn't begin the moment I leave, and even if I leave the house this often is not bark inducing. I know it has nothing to do with him needing to go outside since I can trigger it immediately after him going outside.

The problem as I see it is that he thinks barking or whining in this situation gets me to come downstairs (since it NEVER stops until I do...we are talking all night, so every single time he does it, EVENTUALLY it works), since it did get us to come downstairs and let him outside when we were potty training him. Now that he is potty trained, we have let it go all night multiple times to teach him that he gets nothing out of it, but he just keeps going until we come downstairs in the morning. I reward him for quiet in his crate, and this has worked and is probably the reason he never barks when I am downstairs and able to reward. If someone is around downstairs, he will not bark, so I see no method of training this positively (i.e., we can't send someone upstairs and then reward for quiet, since he is already quiet...its only when he is alone and hears someone upstairs).

I seriously cannot sneak to the bathroom in the middle of the night, middle of the day, or in the morning without having the dog go ballistic the moment he hears the floor creak. The only way to stop it is then to come downstairs (he doesn't even need to see me, just hear me come down the stairs). We are in a town home and the neighbors are getting pissed (since we share 3 walls with three separate neighbors).

I understand the risk of bark collars (and would only consider a vibration, sound or spray...not a shock), and thus consider them a last resort, but I could get fined by the HOA soon and my neighbors are at their wits end. However I see no way of positively training this situation. I am not open to the idea of letting him roam free in the house (I don't trust him yet to not destroy, pee or poop on things to get attention when he is out of my sight), nor moving his crate (it is well placed for a variety of reasons, including the fact that I can work near him most of the day at the current location).  

ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS ARE APPRECIATED!

Before that, she was living, wild, in the mountains in North Carolina, but was rescued by a local when she came down from the mountains to beg for food for her puppies. 

It's been a long road domesticating her, but she's making great progress. She has very good/defined 'communication' skills and communicates a lot with body language before slowly and predictably escalating. Except for moderate resource guarding when other animals are around her food/treats/bones, she gets along great with them. She's very shy and fearful around strangers, but hasn't shown any aggression towards people - even when very afraid. I can easily reach in and take away a toy, bone, treat or food and she doesn't mind at all. She gives me no trouble taking food/food-like resources out of her mouth if she has grabbed something she shouldn't. 

That said - in the last few weeks, if I get too close, or disrupt her when she's laying down, she'll give a quick growl, a tentative snap in my direction, and get up and walk away or resettle somewhere else. For example, if she's laying down on the floor and I reach down to pet her, or if she's laying on the couch next to me, and I shift a little bit. This doesn't happen every time - probably just a few times a week. This will even happen if she's wide awake and aware that I'm moving towards her.

So far I've tried ignoring it but that doesn't seem to be helping any. I feel like taking myself away from the scene won't accomplish anything either and might actually re-enforce the behavior. All of her training has been positive and I'm not sure how to ""positively"" get her to stop this behavior.

For me it seems to be fairly easy to teach a dog how to sit or paw because you can physically make them do it, but to get a dog to recognize your pointing at something or to teach a dog to look at you when you tell them is impossible for me. I cant seem to grasp it.

Can someone give me pointers on how to have them focus on you when you call them. My puppy recognizes her name, but loses focus fast. And then of course I need help with the pointing.

1371305331.0	1geeh6	German Shepherd Puppy	Mil6	21	0	16	"We have a 10 week old GSD.. I am very impressed how smart he is! We have had him for a week and he is 80% housebroken, sleeps quietly through most of the night in his crate (the first 2 nights were very noisy lol), and sits even when on a walk. He is starting to get 'down' as well.

He gets very mouthy however.. I hear this is a common issue with GSD puppies and puppies in general. We let him mouth gently, but if he gets rough we yell out 'OUCH' and it startles him occasionally. If it doesnt work, we stuff a toy in his mouth, that works most of the time. But sometimes he gets so worked up he doesnt care about toys and just chases our ankles or hands and can bite pretty hard. Then I put him in his crate.. I try to lure him in with toys or treats most of the time. Sometime he is so worked up I just have to pick him up and put him in until he calms down.

I walk him 3 times a day to try and manage his energy, and he sleeps on and off probably about half the day. I dont let him sleep on the floor anywhere, I get him in his crate for naps. I feel bad because he seems to be in the Crate a lot, but if I let him out alot of times he just goes to sleep somewhere else.

I try to spend 30 minutes on and off during the day training him. We are focusing on sit and down right now.. He walks ok, the environment is very interesting to him so i end up tugging and guiding him along.

We dont want him interacting with strange dogs at the moment, he doesnt have all his worm/rabies/bordatello meds yet, but the vet has it  schedulded. 

He is good with car rides, stays quiet and lays in the back seat. I have taken him downtown to my moms office and he met lots of people. He was pretty tired, but id say about 5-10 people met him and petted him.

I get worried when he is worked up and kids want to pet him, and im not exactly sure how to work that. Bring a toy on walks? I want to socialize him as much as I can.. Where else should I take him?

Id say the biggest issue at the moment is his biting. I can manage him most of the time. My girlfriend has a harder time, he loves to chase her legs. The breeder gave us some tips.. including 'dominance' excersizes, what I guess was an ""alpha roll"", pinning him down until he gives up. We stopped doing that, and the other dominance stuff she told us to.

Any tips on how im doing, how I can better manage him? I have been around and had problem animals before and I am determined to do everything I can to raise him right."	t5_2r067	True

I don't remember this happening last year, but now that the weather is nice and lots of people are out walking their dogs, they literally flip out when seeing another dog. It's extremely embarrassing. 

The behavior starts with Baxter. We adopted the older one about 9 months ago and he's generally a laid back dog while the younger one has anxiety. Luna's calmed down when we got him, but looks to him for cues now. When he sees another dog, he makes the most heinous sounds and then Luna chimes in. It almost sounds like you're killing them. We've been practicing leash walking - no pulling - while on these walks and they've been listening/responding well, but at the sight of another dog they completely shut down. There's no getting through to them, completely ignore commands, etc. And it doesn't help when the person walking the dog they are barking at decides to come closer to us or stops and stares. Last night, Baxter also started lunging at the other dog - and the guy just stood there! 

I also brought treats with us on the walk last night to try to distract them and get them to listen to commands, but they develop tunnel vision and the treat is meaningless.

I don't understand where this is coming from or how to stop it. We enjoy walking them but this makes us want to stop!

I have a 9 month old Aussie mix who's been having trouble meeting strangers. He's not as socialized as I would like, but it's hard to meet new people since we've just moved. There's a off-leash dog park near by but if any other owners try to pet him, he goes into a barking fit. A local obedience class recommended setting him up for Dog Day care as it would give him an opportunity to have a different group of people handling him everyday (all with pet training experience), and also give him more exercise.

I'm hesitant about just dropping him off though. It feels like I'm throwing him into a pool, sink or swim. I want what's best and this seems like a good idea, but I know he's going to be terrified that first time.

She has a couple of my boyfriend's old socks that we let her have as toys, so I'm pretty sure what's happening is that she doesn't know which ones are hers and which ones aren't. I basically want to teach her all socks that are in the bedroom are off limits. What she does is sneak over to the sock, grab it, and then run into the living room where she lays down with it and very lightly mouths on it. She doesn't destroy them or chew on them much, and I can take them from her once she lays down with it. 

We are in puppy classes at Petsmart and this week we covered how to teach leave it. She was doing great with treats so I thought I should try practicing leave it with socks. She did great with me putting it in front of her and leaving it alone. However once I put it away from her and ignored it for a while, she went after it so I told her leave it and gave her a treat when she dropped it. Here's the problem though, after doing that a couple times she started going get socks from the bedroom and bringing them to me as to say ""I am no longer holding it, treat me now!"" Of course I do not reward this behavior. I simply take the sock from her and ignore her.

I know I still have a lot of practicing to do with leave it, but I'm not sure how to go about handling the stealing socks issue. She's a lot faster then me and sometimes by the time I can get the words ""leave it"" out of my mouth she's already running into the living room with it. 

Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. Yes simplest method would be to just get my boyfriend to pick up his socks (why didn't I think of that?) :p 
Also the room has a door and it is closed. The only time she is allowed in the bedroom is when we are in there as well. The point is she steals them even when we are watching her. She is never out of my sight. "	t5_2r067	True

1358630799.0	16w7z1	My wacky dog is obsessed with a fake deer	gotcatstyle	21	1	7	"Just moved to a new apartment last week. It's in a converted barn on a property with a couple other houses, so it's like a nice little private neighborhood. There's a lawn out front, and on the lawn is a very groovy neon pink metal statue of a deer. 

This deer is visible from the road, where I walk my dog. My dog is a 1 year old Samoyed, and he thinks deer are super exciting. Every single time we're returning from a walk in that direction, he catches sight of the deer and starts barking his head off and trying to get to it.

I have ""introduced"" him to it twice - as soon as he gets up close and can sniff it and inspect it, he realizes it's fake and chills out. But he doesn't retain that information, and the next time he sees it it's back to barky land. (It's extra confusing for him because real deer do walk through the yard, so I'm sure he smells them.)

I wouldn't mind so much except that we're in a valley and he's got a loud bark... the neighbors are very nice and haven't said a word so far, but I don't want him to cause a disturbance every time we go for a walk.

How can I teach him to ignore the fake deer?

1340036211.0	v89gm	[Rant] My Experience with PetSmart's Puppy Training		26	6	25	"I've decided to take my 3.5 month Lab out of the PetSmart Puppy Training Class.  It's been very frustrating.  My dog is great.  I've taught him to touch my hand, look at me (gets his attention in distracting environments), sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, drop it, and walk well on a leash.  He never barks, he rarely nips, and he's pretty much housebroken.  I think he's doing great for his age.  At the class, however, he shuts down.

**Environment.**  We're in a low-walled ""room"" inside PetSmart with 8 other puppies.  Some of the puppy owners admit to never walking their dogs, and many are oblivious as to how to raise a puppy it seems.  You can imagine how well this works out for our class.  There are 2 that bark at each other the entire time, and another is constantly jumping at the end of his leash.  By the end of class, there is inevitably urine on the floor.  So, after 15 minutes of being surrounded chaos, my puppy finally has enough and gets stressed out and ignores me entirely.  He alternates between pulling towards the door and hiding under me, laying down and hiding his face.  Does my dog need to learn to obey with distractions?  Absolutely!  But he needs to learn what is expected of him in a calm environment first, then we can introduce distractions.

**Training**  The trainer insisted that we use his hand signals in class.  Well, we had already taught our several things before we started.  Changing signals confused our dog.  For a week, any time we gave a command he would just cycle through the things we might be wanting him to do, anxious.  He adjusted, but I feel like it put us behind a full week.  The trainer also issued clickers, the same kind to each person (and the same kind we used at home).  So my dog is doubly confused in class when he hears clicks all around him.  Last week, our trainer told us we needed to retrain our dog to walk on the left, even though he's great about staying on my right.  I have limited peripheral vision in my left eye, but even if I didn't I don't see why it matters as long as you're consistent.  I'm not training a show dog, and I don't plan on ever using a dog walking service.  If my dog obeys me, it seems like that should be good enough.  I wasn't willing to confuse my dog yet again just to appease this guy, so that was the last straw.  We're staying home tonight.

So there you go, end rant.  It was a waste of time and money for us.  YMMV of course, but I thought I'd share."	t5_2r067	True

Our question is this: does there need to be a distinction made between these commands?  when we play with him and want him to give us his toy we say leave it just as we would say it to get him to avoid a bone he finds outside.  Once he actually has these things we also say leave it in the hopes he will drop it.

Besides the meaning of the words is there any distinction in the efficacy of it if we do not differentiate between commands?  I just wonder if using ""leave it"" when we want him to drop something he already has makes it less effective or is it possible that he would know to leave anything alone whether or not he already has it.  I'm not so much curious in the fact that trainers just use one vs the other, i'm more interested to know if he would be less likely to drop or give something if we simply say leave it.

1372882528.0	1hl80q	Three basic clicker training questions.	Wayyside	22	1	9	"Hey there, I rescued a 1 year old pit/terrier mix from the pound last weekend - [Meet Murphy](http://i.imgur.com/OwfnMBI.jpg). We began clicker training right away and it has been going pretty well so far. I had a few quick questions I'd like to ask, so please pitch in if you have any advice!

1. **Charging Frequency** - Is it necessary to ""charge"" the clicker before each training session? I normally start each session by having Murphy give me eye contact, click, treat. I do this about 5 times just to build meaning to the clicks because we just started a few days ago. But as he progresses, is this necessary every time or can we just jump into the training?

2. **Keeping Focus in Future Sessions** - Murphy is a pretty excitable dog, and like charging the clicker, i find myself having to draw his focus away from the treats before every session and sometimes midway through a session to get him focused. I normally do the close hand / open hand trick or have some treats in a clenched fist and click treat when he stops trying to get to them. He gets the picture then regains his focus, but it really isn't an ongoing behavior. Is this something that I should *really reinforce* separately by dedicating more sessions to focus? Or is it okay to keep doing what I've been doing? Normally i can get him to stop focusing on the treats and on me within a few attempts, but its frustrating that we have trained this a lot already and he loses focus immediately when we start a new learning activity. 

3. **Adding Distractions While Loose Leash Walking** - Murph has done phenomenal so far learning how to position himself during walks. He performs best in low distracting environments so i have started doing some training sessions in busier areas to compensate. However, I am unsure at which point to click and treat when there is a distraction nearby. For example, there is a group of kids playing in the park. I lead Murph towards them until he notices the kids, when he is fixated on them and does not pull and stays close, I have normally been giving the positive interrupter noise, clicking and then treating... although he may ""drift"" a little bit towards them with his ears perked up and tail wagging. I fear that while training the walking aspect of loose leash walking, I am also encouraging excitability as he seems eager to go check them out (although not pulling). We have only had 2 or so sessions with added distractions though... is this something that i keep having to work at? And is this an OK use of the positive interrupter or should i try to keep his attention on the distractions?

Thanks!

1371145599.0	1ga4pl	Desperately Need Help with Puppy Attacking Older Dog	Lola_Dances	24	5	7	"I have a 13 year old small (roughly 15 pounds) mixed breed neutered male dog named Jack. Recently (just about two months ago) I got a (now) 4 month old rottweiler mix male puppy named Carson. Prior to getting my new puppy I had another male rottweiler who passed away in November, so the older dog is definitely used to living with larger, male dogs. 

At first everything seemed to be going well, and while my older dog definitely didn't like the puppy (he kept his distance and wouldn't play at all with the new guy) he wasn't aggressive and seemed to tolerate him. 

Recently however I have had two incidents with them that have left me quite concerned and I'm not sure how to proceed. Both times my older dog will walk past my puppy (who is lying down) and into another room, and all of a sudden Carson will jump up and tear into the other room and attack Jack. And I don't mean play attack, I mean aggressively attack with snarls and sharp bites (enough that on the first occasion I found a small amount of blood on Jack). I do know that some dogs will be loud and boisterous with play, but I have seen Carson play with other dogs and trust me that this is not play. Jack is screaming and trying to get away when this happens and I have to physically pull Carson off of him. Carson outweighs Jack by about 25 pounds, and Jack doesn't have very many teeth left after many had to be extracted at the vet, so he can't really fight back with his teeth, and body language does not seem to be enough to tell Carson to stop. Both times I have had to pull Carson off because he is really hurting Jack and Jack can't get him off himself. 

Carson has been around lots of other dogs since we got him (while being mindful of the fact that he wasn't fully vaccinated), and goes to daycare and dog parks about two times a week with no incidents. I have watched him play with these other dogs and it is clearly play and not aggression. And usually he is fine around Jack except for these two instances where something (I'm not sure what) triggered him to go after Jack. 

Both attacks were incredibly sudden, and really scared me considering that in a few months, as Carson grows, I won't be strong enough to get him off of Jack if he does it again. It also is incredibly disconcerting for Jack who is clearly shaken up after both of these incidents and who now seems to be somewhat timid of Carson.

I really need help, and while I've seen lots of threads and posts on older dogs attacking new puppies, I haven't seen much in terms of the reverse situation that I'm dealing with. I also know that it's unusual for a four month old puppy to show true aggression, but due to their body language and suddenness this is clearly not a play situation that got out of hand.

Any help or suggestions would be sincerely welcomed as I am really worried about what the future holds for this puppy. "	t5_2r067	True

That way if he follows, I can help her out, or if he's slow to follow, she and I can do something else super fun like fetch or run around together.  
*Technically, she is showing signs of stress, right?  Should I remove her from the park at that time, or is she learning to interact positively in a world where sometimes owners let their dogs hump mine?*  

**Example 2:** My other dog looks stressed sometimes when she's initiating play.  She puts her ears back, prances, often placing her face near the back of the other dog's neck.  She does play bow but sometimes it's not very deep so it just looks like she's jumping around.  A couple of times I've seen her box (quickly hitting the other dog's shoulder with her front paw).   Sometimes she barks or grunt/growls (at that point, I redirect her if the other dog hasn't engaged).  

This morning a dog responded very negatively to the earliest stage of this process (the prancing, body position neck-to-neck) and attacked her (she is fine, she has thick sharpei skin and fur on her neck so the bites did not draw blood).  She had been coexisting with this other dog for about 25 minutes, they had butt-sniffed and proceeded to ignore each other before my dog approached for a second time.  The other owner was on the phone at the time (for maybe 30 seconds... I had actually been chatting with him just before) so he didn't see what happened, neither of us is really sure if they should be in the park at the same time anymore.  
*Was my dog being rude?  How can I read her body language better?  (Note: She doesn't have a tail, it was docked, way too short and possibly by an amateur, before I got her 6 years ago).*  

Thank you for any insight or suggestions!

I don't think she should, but she is persistant. She currently has a large lab and a beagle. I am concerned because of these reasons:

* She does not tend to the dogs' well being (They have never been to the vet, yet go to a public dog park placing her dogs and others at risk)

* The dogs are not trained to behave well (Frequently jumps on people and urinates in the garage sometimes house)

* She may not understand how extra stress may be placed on her current dogs by adding another furry family member

* She is young and may not understand how to plan for long term goals (20 years old)

* She does not have time (she is in college, and the dogs already have separation anxiety)

* The state of her house seems to be the beginnings of a hoarder

We just got into a heated debated that began with her asking me to baby sit her dog-to-be while she is at school. Am I being unreasonable? Please help me find a way to speak to her about this.


**HUGE EDIT:**

I want to thank you all for your supportive and wonderful suggestions. I honestly feel much better and more prepared to try to make sure a 3rd dog is not added to the household.

I will be calling the local animal shelters to see if there is a ""do not adopt"" list. I'll explain about the lack of veterinary care, dog parks visits without vaccinations and suggest a home visit.  

I will not report her to animal control as it will be extremely obvious that I called. However, I will look into calling who ever moderates the public dog parks and explain how she is knowingly placing other dogs at risk. "	t5_2r067	True

1366309640.0	1cmdlc	I feel like I've failed my shepherd and I'm not sure what to do.	khoker	22	3	21	"For context, my last shepherd was an amazing dog and we shared 13 great years together.  He was both intelligent and obedient and we lived in a tiny apartment in the city together without issue.  Lots of walks, bike riding, dog parks, etc.  It was amazing.  He passed about 4 years go.  
    
Last year I felt enough time had passed to go at it again and we got a new pup.  A lot has changed since the last dog and, honestly, I *thought* things would be even better this time.  I've got two kids, a fenced in yard, a bigger place (with an open basement) ... It's like a dog's dream.  But he's a year and half old right now and I'm beginning to admit defeat.  I find myself getting more and more agitated with his lack of progress (and my failure) with respect to training and I'm not sure what to do.  
    
On the good side, he's **amazing** with my children, super friendly with other dogs/people and overall just a good-natured animal.  But what I've found is that the things I thought would make it easier to have a dog are actually making it far more difficult.  
    
The backyard/basement is nice, but it also serves as a really easy cop-out to ""dismiss"" the dog to when I'm annoyed.  Also, the neighbor has outdoor cats -- so barking has become a concern when he's outside.  Also the digging ...  
    
He knows what commands are, but simply refuses to do them unless an incentive is involved (mostly a toy or ball, *sometimes* food -- although he isn't very food motivated).  Recall is non-existent unless I get *very* verbally upset with him.  He knows what I want, he just doesn't care.  Lastly, he continues to ""mouth"" the adults.  It's not biting, but it is just as annoying.  
    
So I'm struggling here.  The lack of food-motivation makes things really difficult.  I don't want to use a toy or ball because he's not focused on learning -- he's focused on the ball.  He's not making the connection between behavioral corrections and rewards.  I've exhausted the physical punishment options because I'm afraid if I slap his nose any harder when he mouths my arm/hand I'm going to hurt him...
    
Exercise has admittedly been tough with a winter that was long and taking care of two kids.  I try for 3 miles on the bike every morning, but with the weather it's not always possible.  I know things may get better as the weather improves but I'm looking for some relatively easy things I can try right now.  
    
Sorry, that's rambling.  But if that sounds familiar to anyone, I'm open to suggestions.  Thanks.

I don't know how to do it with my exercising though, because my hands are not free. Same thing happens when I'm lacing up my boots as well.

By freaking out, I mean he jumps all around barking and getting very anxious (eyes get bloodshot). While I would be able to ignore him like I did for his whining habits before, I can't really let him bark that loud early in the mornings and he tends to bite me while I exercise.

However, the last few days she has started flopping down in the grass after a walk or near the end of a walk. There's nothing medically wrong with her, and she's not tired or afraid. She just plain doesn't want to come back in. I take her on long walks at least twice a day (2-3 miles), and take her out just to take care of business another 2-3 times. Regardless of whether we go out to use the bathroom or go for a long walk, when it's near the time to come back in, she lies down. She's 90-100 pounds, so I can't pick her up. I've tried many things to get her in. Once or twice she came in for a toy or treat. Another couple of times she came in if I hopped around and made funny noises.  I can usually get her standing again with no trouble, but she immediately lies down again. I'm used up in the brain department at this point. If it weren't me I'd be laughing. It's really pretty funny (if you look at it in a funny dog sort of way), but I have no clue what to do. I've owned and trained several other large dogs, and I've never had this problem. I know why she's doing it - she wants to stay outside - but I don't know how to fix it. Any advice would be extremely welcome, and I'll gladly answer any questions.

1364926525.0	1bj3eo	Bringing my dog to the vet tomorrow to discuss anti-anxiety medication, anything I need to know to ask about?	Vooxie	24	3	8	"My apologies in advance for venting and for the length of this post, but I need to get this out somewhere:  

I'm just looking for experiences with dogs that have been on anti-anxiety medication.   

The long and short of it is that my two year old dog has gotten progressively worse since I adopted him at 4.5 months. He is absolutely fear aggressive and has a history of latching on to other dogs without warning. The word ""unpredictable"" is probably the best word to describe him. With my boyfriend and myself, he is a complete love bug. We have used nothing but positive reinforcement with him and he listens to us really well. However, if there is something that is unfamiliar to him, he goes into tunnel vision with his aggression. (Lunging, barking, and trying to bite it.) I can hear how anxious he is in his whine. As a result, on walks are extremely difficult with him.  

When we first adopted him, he was very confident and outgoing. I brought him to a lot of places and tried to socialize him. He became progressively more and more fearful. He's at the point now where he has zero socialization with any dogs besides my one other dog. Because of his anxiety on walks, he gets very little exercise. Surprisingly, this doesn't cause him to act out inside at all. I'm suspecting he may have problems with his thyroid because even as a puppy, he was very low-key and not as hyper as normal puppies.  
Our only saving grace to keeping him active was that I recently bought a house with a backyard. About a week ago, new neighbors have moved in and they keep their dogs outside 24/7. So now, my dog is incapable of going outside without trying to attack the fence.  
I have compeltely trained my older dog, who also deals with reactivity problems, (most likely as a result of having to over-correct the pup when he was younger) to ignore the dogs on the other side of the fence. I have made ZERO headway with the problem dog. He understands his task. He is good at being calm when we're on the leash in the backyard and at a certain distance, and he will stay and take treats... but the second he sees a moment to make a break for the fence, he bolts with no warning and goes into psychotic-mode. It's almost as if he has absolutely zero impulse control. (Which is crazy, because he knows ""leave it"" really well and can stay for long periods of time.)  
I have some experience with training dogs. I know what I'm doing. BUT, recognizing that maybe there is a perspective I didn't see, I hired another trainer who specializes in aggression to help me out. Even she thought there is something ""off"" with my dog. She said he was the most difficult dog she's ever seen.   
So, here's the deal: I'm devestated. I'm taking him to the vet tomorrow to get him tested for who knows what. (Anxiety? Hypothyroidism? Anything else I should consider asking about?) I'm praying anti-anxiety medication will at least make him managable to train outside. (I've tried herbal calming treats and a thunderjacket, but they have made zero difference.)  
If it doesn't work, my next step is to drive two hours to the closest veterinary behaviorist. I'm hoping it doesn't have to come to that.  
I'm just looking for some sort of success stories and positive vibes... something because the last year and a half of owning him have been so difficult. He's such a sweet guy, but no one else gets to see that because he's so scared of everyone. I love him to death, but I know at some point within the next couple of years, I'm going to want to have kids and he is just too high risk to keep around with children unless something seriously changes.  
Oddly enough, the thing I find the strangest out of all of it, is that he never opens his mouth. Ever. The only time I've ever seen him do it is when he is panting because he is overheated. He doesn't open his mouth when he plays with my older dog, he doesn't open his mouth when he's hanging out with us. Event he rare times he wags his tail (when my boyfriend and I come home) his mouth is closed. It's such a small thing, but it boggles my mind how he never just relaxes and opens his mouth to smile.

1363715803.0	1altdy	Are extra rules for territorial/aggressive dogs (such as not allowing them on furniture) BS?	ri0tnerd	23	3	13	"Hi folks.  Some background: 
My wife and I adopted our first dog about three years ago.  He was/is a full-grown lab mix, about 85 pounds.  He was our first dog and neither I or my wife knew anything about dog training beforehand.  We started the standard Petco training class but at the same time he was starting to show some serious aggression problems....95% of the time it was when people came to our home, but he did have a few incidents when people approached him incorrectly out on walks when he was on leash.  

We started working with a behaviorist that was recommended by our rescue organization.  He introduced us to a choke chain and used a combination of leash corrections and treat rewards with various people in the house....and our dog did improve A LOT.  A few months later, my wife and I were out of the country for a few weeks, so we decided to leave the pup with another trainer/boarder to work with him on general obedience and his aggression issue, she also promoted the use of a choke chain and emphasized to us certain dominance-alpha dog principles such as not letting your dog on the furniture in the ""alpha"" position, etc.  

Cut to a few years later....he still has issues with certain people in the house....but generally warms up to them after a brief training session.  I've been trying to improve some bad habits we've let both him and his sister (who we adopted a year after we got him) have picked up and I've been reading a lot here and on other sites about how the whole alpha-dog thing is BS and so is all the correction-based training we've been doing all this time.  

I've started changing my approach....stopped using the choke collars...using a much more positive approach in general.  Is the general consensus that letting dogs on the furniture whenever they want (or perhaps just when they're invited up) also has no bearing on their general level of obedience....even for territorial dogs?  Are there any rules/restrictions that really would alter his perspective that it his his territory to defend?

Thanks!

1363054481.0	1a4f5d	Training Success! There's hope for reactive dogs out there, take heed! [video link inside]	shadybrainfarm	22	3	11	"Hi /r/Dogtraining, first of all, thank you for your advice over the past year and a half. Late October of 2011 I brought home a dog from the Humane Society who would, for better or worse, completely change my life. Some of the very helpful users on this subreddit pointed me in the right direction so that I may have some hope of success with my (much more than a) handful of a dog.

Border Collie cross Nash was surrendered to the Humane Society by his owners who had clearly been sucked in by his good looks and knew nothing about Border Collies! Having been given no boundaries in his early life combined with a genetic predisposition to being a total control freak, he was too much for them to handle. Enter me: sucked in by his good looks and knowing only marginally more about Border Collies, he was too much for me to handle too. However, with a blossoming interest in dog training, and quite a bit of determination, I've been able to make do, and I find myself clearly headed down the sunny path to training success.

Nash came into my home at 7 months of age, and it wasn't long before I realized what a task I had taken on. He was impossible to take for walks, because not only did he not know how to walk on a leash without choking himself or tangling himself up by zipping around at the speed of light, he would growl, lunge, and bark at any dog or person he saw, no matter how far away they were. When given the opportunity (early on, before I knew better) he would bite people and dogs with almost no warning at all. He also tried to chase cars and could not focus on anything I did for more than half a second.

Completely in over my head, I came here (among other places) for advice. You introduced me to clicker training, NILIF, BAT (I'm from Seattle, and took a class at Grisha's training center), LAT and a few other things. My entire world has been opened up to the world of dog behavior, learning theory, and a ton of really fascinating subjects. Now its almost a year and a half later, and both I and my dog are enriched with knowledge and a positive relationship built on trust and understanding. We still have a long way to go, but I am very proud of us, and I wanted to share my story because I know it's not an uncommon problem. With love, an open mind, and a ton more patience than I thought was possible, amazing things can happen.

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3l2Ds6dPPA&amp;feature=youtu.be) was filmed last Sunday. Nash is the Blue Merle. I wish I had video evidence of how utterly INSANE this dog was for comparison, but back then I didn't have the means or foresight to take video of my dog. It was ugly, though. He was loud, and very strong for a spry little 35 pound dog. I do have [This example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp3B0KmBVFQ) of Nash firing off at another dog (who is like, so far away they aren't even visible on the video) but it was taken with a camera strapped to my head so severe motion sickness warning.

My boyfriend and I are adopting a 5 year old female lab/retriever mix from the vet school where I am a student - she has been a breeding dog in the research colony for the last few years, and before that she was at another research facility.  As far as I know she has always lived in a colony situation.  She has a kennel to herself when she is nursing puppies, and otherwise she shares a kennel with another adult dog.  She gets along well with other dogs in this situation - she is one of the quieter dogs in the colony, but doesn't seem to mind the other excitable dogs. 

She has never left the facility, so I imagine that being outside is going to be a big surprise for her.  She is handled all the time by the staff in the colony, so she is used to people, but seems naturally a little nervous.  Not quivering-in-fear-on-the-floor nervous, more like busy bee kind of nervous.  She is friendly after a few minutes, but initially a bit tentative.  I have had the opportunity to meet her multiple times over the last few months, and I've talked with the staff of the colony who know her well, so I feel like I have a decent sense of her personality.

Does anyone have experience or advice on what to expect when we take her home?  We live in fairly quiet city neighborhood, in a large one bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor of a building with stairs.  We have two dog-savvy cats, and a pretty quiet existence in general.  I'm worried that just walking down the street next to cars is going to blow her mind, and that the stairs are going to be scary for her - basically just that the more complex environment is going to be overwhelming.

We are planning on crate-training her, and I've heard from other students that have adopted puppies from the colony that they take well to it because a crate is something familiar to them.  We're going to introduce the cats slowly - she's seen cats before but never been face to face with one that wasn't in a cage. I guess in general our main strategy was to lay low for the the first few days and be really quiet around her to help her get used to the apartment, and to keep outside excursions short so that her world doesn't get too big too fast.

Any ideas or tips on how to make the transition easier for her?  I've worked with shelter dogs before but never a dog that has spent her whole adult life in such a small, consistent environment.

I have a 10 month old Boxer/Pit mix. She's been house trained since we first got her (around 3 months) but has trouble controlling her bladder when excited. For instance, If I leave the house and return several hours later, the sheer sight of my return will cause her to run towards me and urinate as I greet her (talk about a welcome!). This has been going on for several months now and I'm not sure exactly how to proceed. 

Over time she's realized she's not supposed to be doing this so now she rushes to the backdoor immediately for me to let her out. Unfortunately, I rarely have enough time to get to the door, open it and let her out before she pees. This doesn't happen all the time but often enough to be an issue.

Essentially, how do I correct this behaviour? Do I try to ignore her entirely for the first 10 minutes when I walk in (will that slowly get her less excited, hence allowing her to control her bladder)? Any other tips appreciated!

However, since the [July trick](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1hixhp/trick_of_the_month_july_2013_heeling_backwards/) came up on the fourth, that thread will be open for submissions and comments for **another three days!** So go ahead and post a video, even if it's not perfect. 


The rules are the same as last month: 
&gt;1: Teach dog trick. Don't own a dog? Borrow your neighbors or grandmas dog, they'll be thrilled when you teach them cool things.

&gt;2: Film dog performing trick.

&gt;3: Upload video to internet.

&gt;4: Post link to video of dog doing trick in the comments of this thread. This thread will close when nexts months challenge is announced, and the current TOTM will be linked in the sidebar.

So for this month I've chosen a trick I think is really neat and fun (and might even be helpful): teach your dog to help **[take your hoodie off!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P9Fyey4D5hg&amp;t=103)** If you prefer to do this with a jacket, cardigan, or any other piece of clothing that's fine too (as long as it's SFW). 

Here's a **[youtube tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0mxt7v-EYk)** that might help.


**Tips and pointers (some of which mentioned in the video tutorial link above):** 

* In order to set your dog up for success, start out with the most oversized/loose fitting thing you own. Your boyfriends oversized hoodie or a bathrobe, for example. Or perhaps just just throw a blanket or towel over your shoulders and let your dog pull it off, or don't stick your arms through the sleeves in the beginning. 

* If you're afraid your dog will freak out and just tug your clothes all the time, training some ""leave it"" might be a good idea. Make sure to have some really tasty treats to trade with it your dog won't let go of your sleeve, and if you have a dog that's crazy about tug, keep sessions short so they don't get over aroused. 
* 
If you want to add some flair to this trick, train with tighter fitting clothes or ones that does not open in the front. Or you can add more pieces of clothing like hats, socks, gloves, glasses, you name it! Just don't have your dog remove all your clothing and then put it on the internet, that would be weird. 

In ~two weeks there will be a progress/discussion thread, and I hope to hear about your training progress then. And then of course I hope to see a whole bunch of awesome videos in this thread! Good luck! "	t5_2r067	True

We keep an eye on him and his sniffing, and if he runs around a lot, he goes outside, because poo seems to be immanent.

I do also try to take him on at least a ten minute walk each day, and while he didn't poo at first, now he's taking that opportunity.

MrAnderson7	19	0	14	"A little background: We have a 10 week old blue heeler/GSD/greater swiss mountain dog mix and feel like we are progressing pretty well with basic puppy training (bite inhibition, basic commands, house training). However, there are moments where he seems to throw all of that out the window. One second he will be happily playing with a toy, and the next he will suddenly latch onto a piece of our clothing - or sometimes even us! - and start pulling and growling like it is a game of tug-of-war. We have read countless pieces of advice on the subject, and here are the things we have tried unsuccessfully:

**Ignoring it and ending play**: This only makes it worse. If we try to ignore the puppy by standing up and/or crossing our arms and looking away, the puppy still feels a pull on the clothing so (I think) he views that as us pulling back. He will continue to try and pull and bite harder until he bites hard enough to break skin and we have to pick him up and put him in his fenced off area.

**Yelping and looking hurt**: We often will do this in combination with the first solution. Making a loud yelp before we start ignoring him only seems to increase his puppy-rage.

**Walking out of the room**: We usually play with our puppy in the middle of the living room where he has a lot of toys to choose from. When he starts to go into his puppy rage, we have tried walking out of the room and closing the door. Usually, he will latch onto our pant leg the whole way to the door and we have to manually unlatch him and shove him away before we close the door. The puppy doesn't seem to care that we stopped playing and will just take advantage of being unsupervised. He grabs the nearest non-toy item, or just starts chewing the carpet.

**Bitter yuck no-chew spray**: Doesn't affect him at all.

**Time-out**: The thing that seems to have the best effect is picking up the dog and putting him in his fenced-off area of the kitchen and walking away, or just leaving the area if we were already playing in there. Sometimes this makes him cool off, but 50% of the time he is still in his crazy mood and he starts chewing the wires/bars/wood of the baby gates that we put up! We completely ignore him but he has a major freak out and tries to climb over or dig under the gate. If we take him out like this, he goes back to the same thing. 

Chewing the gate is undesirable, and we don't want to put him in his crate because we don't want to use it as punishment. It seems like there is nothing we can do when he gets like this! We are doing out best to only use positive reinforcement, but this is driving us crazy! I realize that this is what we signed up for getting a dog that is part Blue Heeler, but we are looking for the best way to curb this behavior in a constructive way.

1365462941.0	1by972	What can I do to help relieve my dog's separation anxiety?	fluffay_one	22	2	9	"Hi all -

I have two dogs, a female 2-year old beagle mix, and a male 3-year old hound mix.

Long story short, our beagle is perfectly fine when left alone.  Occasionally she might whine when we leave, but we've had her since she was a puppy and she typically just goes and lays in our bed when we're gone.  She was crate-trained so I really focused on leaving her alone in her crate when she was young.


Our hound, however, has major anxiety.  We adopted him when he was 2 (a year ago in a week), and he had been brought to the rescue at 1 year old and was clearly abused, he's skittish if you make sudden movements behind him, if men make sudden movements near him at all.  He has definitely improved and trusts us more now, he used to yelp if I walked away from him while my boyfriend had him on the leash, but he is now much more comfortable/trusting and doesn't mind that scenario.


I worked from home the entire time we've had him so far, leaving them only a few times a month for 6-8 hours at a time, and leaving them more for 4-5 hour periods.  At first we used daycare exclusively due to condo neighbors complaining about barking, but I did some training with baby gates and gradually building up our time leaving them alone and he is much better.


Daycare is expensive and I now have to go to the office daily.  We have a dog walker now who comes mid-day for 30 minutes, and I walk the dogs before I go for 40 minutes and take them to the dog park when I get home.  I noticed the first day I left them with the walker, the hound was a little anxious, but seemed pretty okay once I was home.  However, I feel like the more days I leave, the more anxious he is that I won't come back.  He pees on things despite being taken out and not having a ton of water left, and he also barks at ANY sound in the hallway towards the end of the day.    So far we haven't gotten any complaints, but I feel like it's just a matter of time and I really can't afford daily daycare.


Basically... what more training can I do to help my dog relax a little?  Should I go back to the baby gate training?  I can't do it gradually as I -have- to go to work, but I could try to shorten my days (now I'm gone 10-11 hours due to work/commute, but I could potentially finish work at home and do 7-8 hour days).  I don't know how to train out the hallway barking, our dog doesn't have a ""spot"" (like a crate or bed) to make him go to when there are hallway sounds, and he doesn't really bark at them unless we aren't home!


Any advice would be much appreciated.  I worry that my dog will eat things while we're gone (he has eaten collars, he had a leash removed surgically a month before we adopted him that he ate while alone and anxious, and he eats blankets), so I obsessively move -everything- out of sight when I leave, but I'm still afraid one day I'll forget a sock and he'll eat it out of panic.

Thanks!


[EDIT] 
One other thing I wanted to add is that our hound is very averse to crates/confinement.  We originally tried confining the dogs in the bedroom together like we used to do with our first dog, but he would dig at the door and howl and agitate our other dog so they'd howl together (I recorded them once...it was cringeworthy).  He is absolutely terrified of crates to the point where he wouldn't even be in the same room as a crate which is why I never pursued crate training, it makes me think he must have been frequently locked up as a puppy (along with being abused).

She doesn't whine or flail to get out, she just stands there with this [sad, sad look on her face.](http://imgur.com/a/tsvW9)  I've tried giving her toys and treats, but she won't accept any of them.  I've tried getting her accumulated to the bathroom without giving her a bath, but she just lays on the ground and refuses to accept treats because she associates the bathroom with a bath anyway.  I've resorted to just giving her a shampoo massage and speaking to her in a soothing voice until it's over.  I used to fill up the tub and wash her, which she hated, so now I put the shower head on the gentlest setting so that it's over faster for her and she seems to be less adamant about getting out when she's not standing in two inches of water.  She used to avoid me at all costs until I started cleaning her ears with wipes after baths, she thinks it's a little massage, which is why I tried making the whole bath feel like that, but she just doesn't like it.

She rarely has to take a bath because she hates mud and will avoid it at all costs.  She also has a hard coat so by the time we get home, she's practically clean and we just need to wipe her down with a wipe.  It's not so much of a problem, but she just looks so sad and I'd like her to not be so threatened by it.

He's 8 years old and he looks like a Gordon Setter-Spaniel mix, or maybe an Australian Working Dog-Spaniel mix. His papers indicate he was loved, but his former owner was working two jobs and had to give him up. He isn't a loud dog, which is one of the reasons I chose him. He's never barked at a person as long as I've known him and has been totally friendly or complacent with most dogs. I thought I could wait at least a week to start training him, but I was wrong. This week:

Monday: I came home for lunch, he was whimpering badly. I immediately took him out, as he really had to pee. I took him out immediately after work as he was whimpering again. Had to pee badly again. I felt bad, like I was neglecting him.

Tuesday: Same story as Monday, but this time *he bit his nylon leash in half* while I was gone! This does not seem like an aggressive dog.

Wednesday: Was whimpering just as much, but didn't have to pee as badly. (maybe he is starting to drink on a schedule). Starting to think that he is bored and sees the outside as fun time and inside as loafing time. He does have a lot of energy.

Today: the building manager emailed me and said that my dog has been barking all day! So embarrassed. So I went home and set up a little Skype cam. Back at work I noticed that, yes, he was barking. He looks restless and keeps walking to the front door and back to the couch. Also, there is a neighbor dog that is barking back. It sounds like my dog is barking the most though.

So does anyone have suggestions? He is the perfect dog when I'm around him, but when I go away he is anxious and barks. And when I come back, he acts like he's had to pee for 2 hours even when it's not true.

PS: I am going to the vet tomorrow for his first checkup. If you can suggest any questions to ask related to this that would be awesome.

About a month ago, my boyfriend and I moved in to a new place together. Previously, the dogs and I were in a 700sq.ft. house with an average sized yard. We have now moved to 1200sq.ft. condo with no yard, but a very large park across the street. We now walk them diligently, 2 to 3 times a day, which is leaps and bounds more than they used to get when they had a yard. The dogs are rarely home alone now, because my boyfriend works nights and I work days. 

The problem is my bulldog is being completely unmanageable when approached by other dogs or people in the park. The neighborhood is very dog friendly, and almost everyone in the building has at least one. When a person with a dog approaches, she lunges and nips at them. If a person with no dogs approaches, she nips at my terrier and pushes him out of the way so she can be near the new people. She is always very friendly with humans. 

Prior to the move, she was socialized at off-leash parks and with my sister's boxer and bichon frise. There have never been any serious issues in those situations.

I walk them at night and the park has a lot of different trails, so most of the time it's easy to avoid people, but this evening while I was walking out of the building, an older lady with her older dog were walking in, and a third family held the door open for us.

She also recommends not using kibble for training because it's not very motivating.  

So how much food is too much? Should I be reducing the recommended portion of kibble? Is it ok for him to be eating half a hot dog and a lot of cheese in a day or should I be using different foods? Those seem pretty unhealthy to me to be having in excess, but he isn't at all enthused by the actual dog treats we got. Are there any resources for feeding a puppy a balanced diet with no kibble at all?

I was just hoping someone could talk to me about finding a balance between treats and meals. Especially once we start adding in frozen peanut butter kongs and other not so nutritious snacks I don't want him to be so full that he's not eating enough of the kibble.

She's a great dog-- really relaxed, person- and dog-friendly and while she gets regular walks and trips to the dog park, she's not a really energetic/ hyper dog. We have a little terrier/ daschund mix as well and they're best friends.

Since she came off the street, we've watched her behavior closely, but never found any reason to really stress. She walks OK on a leash (pulls a little), but she sits and stays like a champ. She is very territorial, but once someone is introduced as a friend, she's fine with them and will rest her head on their leg.

Here's the very specific issue she has: if she's being pet by one person, she becomes very protective of them (?) and if a second person even gets too close, or tries to pet her as well, she will growl, though it's so rare that she's ever put in this situation (maybe once or twice) I never gave it much thought other than to warn people to pet her one at a time. Today she snapped at my cousin, who was just holding her hand out for her to sniff, while another cousin was petting her. If she knows both people, like if my husband and I pet her at the same time, it's a non-issue.

I can imagine a situation from her puppyhood when maybe one person held her down while someone else messed with her? I've tried googling a way to re-train her out of this behavior, but I can't really come up with any tips that either explain this particular quirk or how to address it.

My husband is freaked out. The cousin is fine (didn't break the skin). The pit bull is very submissive/ sulky now.

The dog is naturally affectionate but I have been unsure how to handle these breaks. On one hand, I wonder if I should discourage this behavior and keep her focused on the training.

My one pup has a bit of separation anxiety and barks and howls for 20 minutes or so when I leave. This wouldn't be so bad if I lived in a house, but in an apartment it is unacceptable. My solution has been to build a remote control clicker and treat dispenser. It works on a remote similar to a wireless car unlock and lets me leave him in my apartment, and click and reward from outside. It also has applications for teaching stay, sit from a distance, down from a distance, crate training while alone, and other applications.

Trouble is, in every one of the puppy videos I've watched, the pup is sitting there looking attentively at the treat in her hand.  I've just started trying to teach my pup to sit, and, well, that just doesn't happen.  He's too busy trying to gnaw through my hand to get at the treat to even notice where my hand is going.  I've tried waiting until he's in a calm mood to practice, but that doesn't really happen either.  He's either in full-on alligator mode or fast asleep.  I've had him for about two weeks now, and I can honestly say there hasn't been a single minute so far where he's awake and not trying to wrestle/sprint/bite.  

He's only eight weeks right now (yes, I know six weeks is too young to get a puppy - see my previous post in /r/dogs if you want more info) - is he too young for settling down occasionally?  Or is he just destined to be a super hyper dog?  Or is it (most likely) user error?  Any advice for getting him to pay attention during training sessions or even just lie down and relax now and again would be appreciated.  I've got a fair amount of experience with dogs, but I've never had a puppy younger than 4-5 months, so I'm not sure if this is normal or if I'm just doing it wrong."	t5_2r067	True

Yes, walks can be for sniffing, but there are times when I want him to keep walking without stopping (eg when I am actually trying to go somewhere, or when he wants to sniff/mark something inappropriate). So, I set out to train ""let's go,"" meaning, ""stop that sniffing/peeing and keep walking."" I thought that I could eventually use this to transition to a default ""no sniffing now"" heel. Here's what I did: 
1) when he started to sniff, pull him gently away and when he looked at me instead of the smell, click and treat. 
3) also click and treat when he looked at something like he *wanted* to sniff, but chose to keep walking
4) randomly treat when he was walking in heel position to reinforce the ""right"" behavior

So, it's now about 80% reliable that I can call him away from sniffing/marking (assuming he doesn't find a dead gopher or something). Next, I started calling him away from all smells on walks, thinking that he would get the idea that ""let's go"" meant ""walk"" not ""sniff"" for the whole walk. But after months of calling him away from every smell on every walk, it seems he wants to sniff just as often as ever. 

--Is he now sniffing on purpose to get a treat? 
--Is sniffing more rewarding than food (probably) so he'll always want it?
--Is there another way to teach the difference between times it's OK to sniff or not? Can I build on the work I've done in a different way? What can I try next?

TL;DR: I rewarded my dog for not sniffing/marking on walks but he still tries to do it. How do I get him to heel as a default without constantly calling him away from things?"	t5_2r067	True

I know it's her fault, because she treats him like a doll or a baby. She thinks it is ""cute"" when he snarls and growls at her. She doesn't discipline or train him in any capacity. He steals food off the table regularly and bites when you try to take it away. He snaps when I try to move him out of my spot on the couch.

There is no ""nice"" way to tell someone that they are utterly useless at training their dog, and that their dog's bad behavior is their fault.

But we have had a lot of problems with him when we have guests over.  Any time someone comes, whether they're new or a returning person, he'll jump at them.  He jumps up, punches them with his front paws, sprints away, sprints back to them, and repeats for 3-5 minutes.

What I've done thus far is just totally ignore him when he jumps, and praise/pet him only when he's on the floor.  This has worked for the most part for ME, but he still jumps up on anyone else.  I've been trying  to have our guests do the same thing, but if grandma visits he might hurt her, so I have to put him in the cage and he goes absolutely insane.

He's been very good about not chewing up cords or cables, he mostly just goes for socks or other soft clothing while we're with him.

However, this morning I found he bit off the plug for a floor fan during the night. It was tossed to the side. My guess is he just wanted to bite it off. I get that he probably did it out of boredom but he's never done this before.

He nipped my 5-year old's hand while she was petting him. Since then, he has growled a couple times when I am petting him and she approaches to pet him, too. He had no problem with my older child until yesterday. She was having him do a trick, ""Give me your paw,"" and he barked, lunged, and put his mouth on her hand. I yelled No! And he immediately tried to roll on his back but I sent him to the bedroom.

His ""nips"" don't break the skin or even leave a mark, but he is a 95-lb dog so it is scary. He recently visited my daughter's 2nd grade class (before all this started) and was perfectly fine with 30 kids surrounding him and petting him. He has always been very personable and trustworthy, so this behavior is pretty confusing.

We have taught my daughters to be respectful to all dogs and don't let them treat him in appropriately. They feed him each evening in a controlled manner (he sits and waits until the ""okay!"" Command to eat).
Vet gave him a clean bill of health. He's been a wonderful dog with good manners for 8 years and I would very much like to keep him in our family. He is currently at the in-laws house but I would like to bring him back to our family if I can do so safely.

I was playing with my Newf a few minutes ago and noticed something that I figured I'd share.  When we are playing tug o' war, we are killing the toy, we are not fighting over the toy. 

I used to work with dogs and was surprised by how often trainers/handlers would say playing tug is ""bad"", that it ""encourages aggression"" yada yada.  I never believed it, and knew that all good dog-sports trainers used the tug as the reward.    

And though It's easy to show someone that it's not a fight when you teach the dog to ""out"" the toy, what I noticed today showed me why.  Maybe this is well-known information, maybe I even read it in a dog-training book way back when, but today was like an epiphany for me haha.  When I've seen packs of African Wild Dogs or Wolves, they will work together to take it down.  And before the animal is even dead they'll all jump in and start tugging it like crazy.  They dont stop til it's innards are outards and the meal begins.  When the meal begins status may come into play, but not at all during the kill.

I have a sweet girl who has been doing really well on her leash training recently. In general she still walks out towards the end of the lead, but doesn't haul on it the way she used to. 

At this point she still gets really excited over every small animal we see. This of course isn't a problem (and is natural really) as she tends to just strain to the end of the leash and watch intensely. 

The problem is cats.

When she sees a cat she absolutely goes insane. I wouldn't mind her pulling after them, but she goes all out full jump against the end of her leash (often slamming herself back into the ground). The worst of it though is the noise she makes. She makes sounds that I imagine coming from a dog being beaten.

He isn't trustworthy off leash so we take multiple long leash walks every day, as many as I have time for. We also jog 4 miles every other day. We work on reinforcing basic training/practicing new commands daily, and he gets his evening meal in a Kong Wobbler. So he's really not lacking in exercise/mental stimulation. 

This problem has been happening for a couple months now. We'll be out on a long walk, and maybe an hour in (usually after we've turned around to go home, but not always) he'll start pitching a fit. 

It's kind of like he wants to play, but seems a lot more frustrated and is MUCH harder to deter. First he'll grab the leash and try to play tug with it. If I ignore it and keep walking forward, he'll start growling and jumping around, yanking on the leash until he pulls me off balance (he's about 50lbs, I'm about 125). If I stop walking or try to distract him by getting him to sit (even if I have treats), he will square off, look at me and bark in my face. It's a very agitated bark and very different from how he acts when he wants me to play with him. 

For the life of me I can not figure this behavior out. The only way to deter him is to pick up a stick, which he'll immediately grab and start shaking it and growling (like he's ""killing"" it). Sometimes he'll then walk forward holding the stick and eventually calm down; sometimes he'll lose interest in the stick and try to engage me again.

I met a dog behaviorist who studied with Cesar Millan - I don't agree with a lot of his techniques, but I liked the behaviorist and she gave me some good insight on my relationship with my dog. She does condone using ""corrections,"" not hitting but kind of jabbing him to jolt him out of that keyed-up headspace he gets into. I don't like it much but I was desperate enough to try it today when he started doing his leash antics; the result was even more barking in my face and very agitated growling/mouthing at my wrists when I went in to ""correct"" him.

I'm concerned because it's getting worse. It used to happen once per walk; today he did it three times. And it's dangerous because we have to walk right next to the road - he could jump in front of a car or pull me in front of one. 

I'm really stumped because otherwise our dynamic is great. It's just me and him; I love him to pieces, I know he loves me, and inside the apartment he listens and behaves wonderfully. I can't make any sense out of this incredibly frustrating behavior that seemingly sprang up out of nowhere. 

Doggy psychologists and seasoned trainers - halp!



**UPDATE:** So, I put your advice into action today. We went for our usual run, but I tried making it more interesting for him. First, I let him wear his backpack and carry his own pickup bags (we both love this, but it means I can't use his harness and he's not great about loose leash with just the collar, so it only works with jogging). Then, instead of doing the exact same run, we turned around a little early and in an entirely different spot than he's used to. Then we did some zig-zags back and forth across the road, with lots of praise for keeping pace and focusing, especially at spots where multiple ""tantrums"" have occurred. 

And it worked! Not a single freakout today! 

So now I have something to work with - keep it interesting for him so I get lots of good behavior to reinforce. I'm gonna keep it up, work on teaching him the ""touch to communicate"" thing, and be a total hardass about stopping everything and ignoring it if it happens again. Thank you all so much for your great advice."	t5_2r067	True
1363100980.0	1a5f0i	Leaving the pup alone at home: Trial and error?	JeremiahGunz	20	1	9	"Hi guys, few weeks ago I adopted a sweet female boxer. She was 5 months old at the time, and she is now almost 7 months old. She is fantastic. Calm when in the house, excited and playful outside. She is a bit shy with new people but that's fine. 

I crate trained her right from the beginning and I must admit it was was easier than expected. She likes her crate. She sleeps in it without whining. It is a few feet away from my bed and I plan to increase the distance beetween the crate and the bed very soon.

And I work from home, so I dont have to crate her often during day time. When I have to, she usually cries a bit. I cant really know for how long she cries when I leave her. Anyway, so the other day, I had to leave for about 4 hours, from 7 to 11pm. I didnt really want to crate her from 7 to 11 and then go to sleep and crate her again for another 6-7 hours, so I thought it was a good idea to give her a bit more freedom. So I pretty much emptied a spare bedroom for her. There was a bed in there, a small table with a book on it and thats it. I gave her few toys ans I stuffed Kong as well. I crossed my fingers and left the house.

So I come back about 4 hours later. The bedroom she's in is downstairs, and I could litterally smell that things were not right, if you know what I mean. I opened the door, and yes, nightmare. Shit everywhere on the bed, floor, walls, door. She scrached the bottom of the door to the point that we can see it from the other side of the door. Oh and she completely destroyed the book on the table, obviously. Anyway, you get the picture.

I am not blaming it on her at all. I think my mistake is pretty obvious. 4 hours was a too long period for me to 'test her'. I should have try smaller steps first. But from here, where do I go? When should I try to let her in a room by herself? Is it trial and error? If she succeed I give I try it again for a bit longer the next time, and if she doesnt I go back to the crate method?

I am breaking lurker status and finally making my first post on behalf of my friends that adopted this fine fellow 2 weeks ago. 

http://i.imgur.com/WperiYE.jpg 

Bentley is 6 or 7 years old.  He was abused and nearly starved to death according to the rescue folks.  By the time my friends brought him home he was healthy and happy and very well behaved.  He is very loving and playful with all members of the family (Mom, Dad &amp; 2 teenagers) including their Chihuahua.  The problem is when everybody leave for work/school.  Started with knocking over the trash, getting into cupboards and eating ALL THE THINGS.  They have tried a locking trash can and baby locks on the cupboards.  He cracked those in a day.  So they tried putting him in the basement before they leave.  One basement door destroyed and they came home to find him sitting calmly on the couch.  Next, a harness and long leash in the basement.  Harness escaped like Houdini.  Finally,  a Thundershirt and chain link kennel in basement.  Escaped kennel like Hannibal Lechter -destroying the Thundershirt and ind causing himself injury (teeth/pads) in the process.

My friends are at the point of tears and their wits end.  He is such a sweet and well behaved dog, but seems to have to have severe separation anxiety and a batshit obsession with escaping confinement so that he can pillage the kitchen when everyone leaves.  They have scolded him and if they point a finger in his face, he snaps.  They have tried various exercises trying to establish dominance and changed their morning routine trying to keep him calm, but he still acts out.

They all love this guy and do not want to bail on him, but they can't afford to have the house they rent destroyed.  He obviously has emotional issues and nobody wants make them any worse.  Today's trip to the vet they agreed that he prolly needs some kind of doggy Prozac.

This family used to have Labs for years but this is their first Weimaraner.  They understand the breed is high strung and very smart, but to see him injure himself is more that anyone can take.

So does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing or any suggestions?  Is this likely to pass once he fully groks that this is his home and he will have food and love and no reason to fear?

My dog is a 2yo male GSD (see my posts for photos). We rescued him over the summer. The rescue organization thinks he grew up in a run, so we weren't sure if he had ever been housebroken. Thankfully, he only peed in the house about 3 times in the first months that we had him, peed on walks, and learned how to hold it when we were out.

....Until the past month. He inexplicably started peeing in one particular room when we are not home. When we go out, we leave him and our other dog in a closed hallway with their beds (their ""kennel"" or ""crate"", if you will). This hallway has a door that leads to the room... and if we happen to leave that door open, he will go in and pee everywhere instead of holding it in.

We are signed up for a basic training course starting next month, but I'm posting here in the hopes of addressing this issue sooner. I don't want to risk him doing it again. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!"	t5_2r067	True

1358796545.0	17071r	Friend's Pit Bull Killed The Neighbor's Cat	grtkbrandon	24	6	66	"Firstly, I apologize if this isn't the place for this, I just need some quick general advice and thought this might be the place! If not, please direct me!

I was not a witness to this event, I only received a frantic phone call describing what happened. The dog, Bandit, is quite fond of digging. This time he wound up in the neighbor's yard, found a cat, and killed it. Now the neighbor's are pissed and want to put Bandit to sleep for being a dangerous animal. I realize this is a sticky situation and was hoping for some general advice on what our options are. Right now my ex and Bandit are currently out driving around. She probably thinks she's a fugitive at the moment. She called me asking for advice, but I have no idea.

A bit on Bandit:

Bandit, was found a year ago tied up to a post, starving to death, and covered in probably close to 30 or so cuts, scraps, and gashes. We weren't the ones who picked him up, and can only assume what his life was like before we got him. 

Based on his condition, we were hesitant to introduce him to my ex's other 4 dogs (another being a 3 year-old female pit bull). However, he assimilated in with the pack nicely and there were never any aggressive incidents, that I'm aware of. 

However, this isn't the first time he has been in trouble. A gate was left open and he, of course, escaped. Trotting up and down the road a bit. He found an old lady and her small dog. Bandit didn't show any signs of aggression towards the lady or her dog, but she called someone on him anyway. We managed to get out of it, thankfully. 

*TL;DR: Ex's pit bull got out and killed the neighbor's cat. Now they want to put the pit bull to sleep. Are there any options here?*

EDIT: The cat is apparently still alive, and now the neighbor's aren't looking to put the dog to sleep as of now. Thanks for all of the responses! I greatly appreciate it! :)"	t5_2r067	True

I usually let him sleep on my bed. Maybe a lot of you will say that's a no-no, but it's cold and he's fluffy and we've never had a problem before. He gets down without a fight if I tell him to. So last night as I was about to go to sleep, he was next to me, lying on his side totally relaxed. He was taking up a bit more than his fair share of space, so I went to push him over a little. I don't think I hurt him - I always do this gently, just sliding him - but this time, he turned and let out a short growl.

I made him get off the bed immediately. It rattled me since he has NEVER done anything like this before - one of the best things about him is how sweet-tempered he is; little kids can come up to him on the street and give him hugs, and he's totally cool about it. The growl made me worry that he's not as trustworthy as I thought.

He may have just been irritated - I had been brushing him not long before it happened, which he hates right now because the PetSmart groomers didn't dry him off properly and now he's got a bunch of matts in his fur. So maybe he was cranky.

What do you guys think? Is one growl a sign of something more serious, or was he just having a bad night? If it happens again, what's the best way to make sure he knows that's not OK?"	t5_2r067	True

She started offering the behavior to touch/lick my hand so we went with it. Now it's getting to the point where I can actually use ""touch"" to get her into a position (such as from a sit to a stand) and lure her around! She quickly picked up that targeting my hand gets a click and treat. It's still in the beginning stages, but I am super stoked with the progress we're making, and the fact that she is offering up behaviors that I can reward now! (And she likes it too).

I'm not sure how to go about teaching her to see another dog and go, ""Meh,"" and move on. When she gets too excited even with me she will play bite me, which she also does with other dogs too.

I did introduce her to a friends dog who has a good 40-50 pounds on her and eventually her inappropriate play resulted in the larger dog wrecking her shit.

I digress.


The book is called [Dogs Are From Neptune](http://www.amazon.com/Dogs-Are-Neptune-Jean-Donaldson/dp/1929242654) and I'm about halfway through and it's actually pretty intriguing. Jean Donaldson covers a lot of behavioral problems from Stranger Aggression to Dog-Dog Aggression to Obedience to Resource Guarding. She takes letters from dog owners and answers them with the best advice and training advice she can give. I urge you all to check out this book seeing that some of the problems that were published have had some similarities to recent posts here. 

Donaldson gives people basic exercises to use with dogs to help condition their problems so they can live happier lives. She also touches on the mental perspective of dogs where medication is the cheaper/more effective route to take because (much like people) dogs can develop a mental illness which meds can ease away their issues. Some instances, medication is the only alternative.Remember that a happy dog will live longer and healthier than a dog who is stressed.

1294391925.0	ext1e	So my dog was bored and nagging me to play with him, so I taught him to play 'Hide and Seek'.	col381	18	1	13	"He loves it. 

I started out by getting him to sit &amp; stay around the corner. I then hid his ball in one of three simple to find places (under a bucket, under a towel on the floor, under the blanket on his dog bed), and called him and told him to find his ball. As he was sniffing around looking for it, I called out no, no, no, YES, YES (as he knows what these words mean already) the first couple of times to get him used to the idea of how to find it, but since I use yes/no for discipline I didn't want to use those words so then moved the commands to no cold, no cold, YES HOT, YES HOT etc. which he quickly adapted to, then eventually moved to using just cold/hot after a few times. 

The first few tries I made it very easy for him, practically guiding him to where the ball is each time, but now after playing about 20 rounds of the game I can just sit on my couch calling out cold/hot until he finds the ball. He then of course gets a treat and massive excited pats and hugs each time he finds the ball. We have just been playing non stop for the last hour and a bit and he is currently the worlds happiest dog.  

Anyway I just wanted to share this with you all, it was really easy to teach (especially since he already knew yes/no and the 'where's your ball? get your ball' game) and I fully intend to expand this to be even more fun for him, making it harder, expanding the hiding area etc. He absolutely loves this new game he has learned, it will come in very handy for those rainy days where we are both stuck inside and bored with nothing to do.

1375937210.0	1jxqap	My dog plays to rough with my cat	1d10t_error	19	4	15	"Hello all.  I'll start by saying that I'm a first time dog owner.  I've tried to do as much research as I can.  We even attended a 6 week training course.  The course was very helpful.  Our boy (Winston) learned to sit, lay and come on command.  He does most of these fairly well.  I'm sure he would do better with more work, but overall I'm pleased.  

When we first brought Winston home from the shelter he had very little interest in our cat.  I was happy to see this.  Our cat has been with us for several years and is very important to us.  However since then he has changed quite a bit.  He no longer leaves the cat alone.  At first it was just playful batting with his paws.  Now it's full on pin and wrestle.  It's not really aggressive as he doesn't break skin.  I always stop it when it happens, but it's just getting worse and worse.  Today he drug my cat off of the couch by the neck and began to shake him.  It was very scary and upsetting.  Of course I stopped it as soon as I could.  It's like he knows he shouldn't do it because as soon as I stand up, he quits.  But once I sit back down he goes right after the cat.

I should tell you that I try to make sure he isn't inside to much during the day.  We do at least one walk (aprox. 1 mile) each day.  And usually about every other day we go to the dog park for about an hour.  I really don't know what to do moving forward.  I will take any advice you can offer &amp; am happy to provide more information.  Thanks.

EDIT:

Thanks everyone for the great advice.  I'm excited to try a lot of it.  So to answer a few questions, Winston is a mix between a Beagle &amp; Boston Terrier.  He is 16 months old.  We adopted him right at 1 year.  He weighs about 23 lbs and is a bucket of energy. I will start walking him more.  I have no problem with that.  Any suggestions on a distance?  Or do I just need to walk him until he doesn't want to go anymore? 

As to the suggestions of an escape route, we've done that.  Winston is blocked from entering the back half of my house with baby gates.  The cat comes and goes freely while Winston cannot.  However as the play becomes more and more rough my cat tends to venture out less and less.  

I may be wrong but I still believe it is playing.  Also I should point out that sometimes the cat starts it.  I've seen numerous times where Winston is sleeping and our cat (Chinet) stocks Winston.  Chinet will sneak around a corner and jump on Winston and have a good play.  I really like when they do interact.  It's just recently that the playing has moved to a level I'm uncomfortable with.  I'm sure it's partly my fault as I probably should have stopped that behavior the first time it appeared.

My boyfriend and I adopted [Rosco](http://i.imgur.com/vjDjt5R.jpg), a 10 year old German Shepherd mix about a month ago. He is pretty awesome in almost every way, but he has a pathological desire to chase cats and squirrels. 

I'm working very hard to try and countercondition this, especially as our street is full of cats, and the parks are full of squirrels.. 

When we do suddenly accidentally come across one I repeat firmly 'no', and make sure to remove him ASAP. Jogging past helps too. I'm actively working now with trying to find his threshold with the squirrels in the park and treating him extensively for sitting and staying by me without pulling. 

My question is this: is this an ok threshold? He is not pulling or lunging or barking, but is still very alert and not relaxed. However if he sees a cat or squirrel, no matter what the distance, he does not relax. The threshold just seems to matter about pulling versus not. If I treat him while he is on high alert (albeit not loosing his shit) is this reinforcing an unwanted alertness? Or is this simply the first step in the long process of teaching him to ignore these fluffy things?

I can tell when it is going happen, when another dog approaches her and sniffs near her face much she brings her head back but if they go for too long she'll snap at them until they back off.

Sometimes she'll just give a bark or snarl and that's enough but other times she can get quite aggressive although she hasn't caused any actual harm so far.

We are planning to run to a bigger dog-park which is (1.5 km / ~1 mile) away when I´m finished with my work today. I have bought a 10 m leash that we can use there to train in a bigger radius. However would it be good to let him off the leash there already- especially when other dogs approaching or should we wait another few days before doing this?

Edit: 
Thank you all for your replies! 

I guess I will wait for it to unleash him already. However I will train recalling him by fixing the big leash to a tree. I will ofcourse pay attention to his behavior and when I acknowledge that his stress level goes up we will train this in a low-distraction envirnoment. 

Edit: Of course I would not do this within the dogpark - however there is a small forrest nearby I guess we will train-play there a little bit.

1369275749.0	1evms7	Curbing Herding behavior.. kids aren't sheep silly. Help please.	Tornfeathers	18	2	7	"First a little background. 
I have a Border Collie rescue, he was an abuse victim my ex boyfriend got at a year old before we met and he never trained. I spent a lot of time training him the 4 years we were together. He's about 6 years old now. After he dumped me he kept the dog 5 months after refusing to let me have him and then threw the dog in the pound and I went and paid the fees to rescue him and register him and everything. 
So I'm unsure where and how in the 5 months my ex had him before putting him in the pound but he never had this issue before. The only thing he ever use to try to chase were squirrels but I wouldn't let him. 

So now he has a new issue. He's been living with me Since March 1st and this problem seems to be increasing and I haven't figured out how to curb the behavior. 
When a child runs by him he wants to chase and herd them. Border Collies herding like they do I don't want him to snap at the child's legs or accidentally bite or otherwise injure the child. 

Any tips on curbing the herding behavior before it's too late would be helpful. 
His recall is great when off leash, he has gotten heal down, he sits and waits, I've curbed the food aggression. 
I'm at a loss on how to curb the herding behavior. 

We go on long walks every day and I take him places he can run off leash and chase toys and play with my friend's dogs. I'd just love some ideas on getting a herding dog not to try to herd the neighborhood kids. :/

Thanks for any ideas you may have.

1369144745.0	1eri39	Trainer hanging aggressive dog with choker?	painkilller	20	1	42	"My sister and her boyfriend got a trainer for their very aggressive Shar Pei mix. He doesn't attack people but is ready to attack anyone getting close to him, and has bit 3 people by now. He sometimes doesn't let my sister in her home, and really boyfriend is the only one he listens to. 

They hired a dog trainer who is all about alpha male training and showing the dog he's the dominant one. When the trainer took him for a walk dog tried to attack him and that's when he lifted him in the air, choking him with his choker, after which dog had pissed and poo'd (is this a word?). After the training session a motorcycle passed by, dog usually barks like crazy in that case, but this time he's just laid in the yard.

This training method seems rather extreme to me, is it ok in this case?

Edit: this trainer is very popular in our city, and has supposedly fixed many dogs and this dog tried to attack him on 2 occasions, today and day they met. I'm al lactures atm, I'll reply to you and give more info in few hours. 

&amp;nbsp;

edit2: First thing that was weird to me is taking an unknown dog, which you know is aggressive, for a a walk without his muzzle. He also reached with his hand towards the dog even when he knew the dog would try to bite him, which he did. And the hanging was really red light so I wanted to ask you guys.

 From your replies I'd say there's no need for a discussion, no matter how aggressive dog is, hanging him is never justified. Trainer said that he's training dogs like this for 27 years and encouraged the boyfriend to treat the dog the same, and said my sister can't do that since she's not strong enough, which is true but I doubt only 7ft tall males are able to train aggressive dogs. 

From what the trainer said, I'd say this is his usual routine and there is nothing to do but to fire him and get another one, which might be a bit harder since there aren't many trainers here, especially not new school ones.

I have a 5-month old GSD and he gets really fixated on people playing with any type of ball. 

For example, if we're at the dog beach and he sees two people kicking a soccer ball to each other off in the distance he will bolt. There is a softball field right next to my dog park. If people are throwing the ball to each other, he will run back and forth between the two closest points along the fence. He just wants to play with them so much.

Forget about him being responsive to any commands. He whines like no other whine I've heard come from him. Its pretty intense.

To be clear it's not a fixation on the ball itself. I can play fetch with him and his behavior is normal. But when two or more people are playing ball he goes pretty nuts.

Is there any way I can minimize this behavior?

Looks fun for the dog and is an impressive trick once mastered.  So I tried working on getting my dog to use my leg to jump off to grab her frisbee.  With a bent leg, I'd hang the disc out and have her jump up for it.  She clearly doesn't realize it's OK to push off from me and just tries a free standing jump, or runs around my leg to get a better angle.  

So I switched to a different trick alotogether for now - kneeling on the ground, sort of hunched forward (facing away from her) holding the frisbee behind my head and telling her to get it.  The idea being that she sees that during training it's OK to jump on me like that.  
So, that's worked OK, though it ends out still being more of an awkward stretch up to reach the disc rather than a nice run up back, but that's OK we'll get there.   

I guess my question is, has anyone worked on these kind of tricks and have any suggestions for things that worked for them?  I realize it will take a bit of time, but if I can get different ideas, I might make it easier for her to understand each step.  "	t5_2r067	True

She is a small terrier mix (about 15 pounds) but isn't at all intimidated by the larger dogs and enjoys their rougher play.  Yesterday when we went my dog approached a group of dogs and one of them started to ""play"" with her. It seemed like rough play until my dog started running away with her tail tucked and the dog caught her. She rolled to her back and the other dog pinned her by the neck.

The other dog's owner pulled their dog off, it calmed down a bit and when they released the dog, it immediately ran to my dog and did the same aggressive ""play"" (which it was not doing with other dogs before we got there).

We ended up leaving with my dog (and a few other small dog owners left with theirs as well) because we felt this dog was being too aggressive and ignoring the, ""I don't think this is fun,"" warning signs.

The other dog was not large (maybe 30 pounds) and I am unsure of the breed. I am really annoyed by it. Should I have said something to the other owners? This park DOES have another area for small dogs, but it is very small (maybe 20ftx30ft) compared to the large dog area (which is literally hundreds of feet by hundreds of feet) and normally the dogs in there are less well adjusted small dogs that are afraid of life. The other people made a comment as we were leaving about their dog, ""liking to play with other dogs"" but my dog DOES like to play with other dogs, she whines when she sees ones because she wants to play, she plays with other dogs at our apartment complex, her tail is normally curled over her back and wagging.

He knows his name, and always stops and looks when I call.  He also usually gets closer to me, but if he doesn't want to go inside or be caught, he won't get close enough for me to grab his collar.  If I try to catch him, it becomes a game, and jumps around and dodges me with his tail wagging. It makes me want to pull my hair out.  It most often happens at night when I'm trying to get him into the house for the night.  Initially, offering him a treat would get him in, but I kept having to up the ante to get him in: from a treat; to a little peanut butter; to his favorite marrow bone; which I keep on the top shelf until I permit him to play with it; to some wet food that I keep on hand for when I want to give him an extra special treat.  After a while, he stops coming inside for each thing, perhaps because he knows that if he holds out, he gets something better.  I tried going outside and sitting down, making him come to me--again it worked a bit, then he stopped getting close enough for me to catch him.  If I go out and do play with him, he will eventually slip up and I can grab him, but I feel like the playtime encourages the behavior.

This has also been an issue a couple if times when he has managed to slip his leash in a walk.  He will stay close to me, but not close enough for me to catch him and releash him.

Now that he has arrived home, we realize that he is a 4 year old dog who: Isn't housebroken, doesn't know his name, was an outdoor dog, and has SEVERE anxiety issues. The people who surrendered Bubba obviously lied on the intake exam. There is no way he was an indoor dog. The majority of his time is spent crying and barking at the door.

The SPCA told us he was indoor, housetrained, and even knew shake. (Obviously none of those are true.)

We've only had him for a day, but I can tell we're going to have a long road ahead of us. We're not going to give up on him, but we're going to be really overwhelmed soon if we don't get help.

I'm teaching her to be an office dog, and the main obstacle right now is barking and generally going nuts when people come in the door. What I do is tell her to hush, and distract her with a series of treats while the person is coming in. If she barks, I withhold the treat and tell her no, and then give her the treat if she stays quiet for a moment. If I can catch her before we hear the noise outside, she's usually fine. However, if they surprise both of us, it's a good couple seconds before I can get her distracted from the new person with the treat. 

My intent was to get her to stop focusing on the door, and if someone comes in, I should be the focal point because she gets treats. I've been increasing the amount of time between treats while someone's there, but I feel we've kindof plateaued there.

There are a number of problematic behaviors my dog has but I want to start with the most pressing one- thanks for any guidance you can offer, /r/dogtraining!

I've had my dog, a rescue from some sort of puppy mill horror, for about 4 years now and she was maybe 2 when they found her.  After the first month or two of having her, she developed a separation anxiety problem when I leave and a somewhat smaller one when anybody at all leaves.  I have a somewhat obnoxious new neighbor who is complaining about it now and although there is no risk of eviction, I'd really just like to shut her up. I am afraid that one day at a future home it will lead to a real problem, though.

Essentially, as soon as I close and lock the door (she typically waits for this signal, though not always) she runs and jumps about and barks at the top of her lungs for maybe 1-3 minutes.  This is also typically accompanied by ramming the door with her head once, in the few times that this has been done with a semi open door this closes it.  After this brief episode, she usually quiets down and goes back to sleeping or whatever she was doing before.  There are no additional destructive or disruptive behaviors.

I should also note that she does notice leaving behaviors, like getting dressed and especially getting the keys and whips herself into a quiet frenzy, mostly just following intently during this process until we finally leave.

I've tried a number of things over the years, not making any big deal of leaving or arriving, sending her to her crate prior to us leaving (she is very responsive to this command and loves her crate), getting fully dressed with the keys and just sitting around or taking a nap, coming back in immediately afterwards etc.  Regardless of what is done, she waits until the door is closed and bolts to the door to make a ruckus.  Sometimes I'm able to tell her to go back to her crate through the door, mostly it doesn't work.  If someone else is leaving she does a bit of this too but if I am still home I'm able to tell her to go to her crate and she behaves herself since I am there.

The trick to this is that the problematic behavior only starts after I have closed the door and am unable to correct.  How can I train her to be chill as I am leaving?

He has been well socialized with other dogs and people, and is the sweetest boy! He loves everyone right off the bat, and being a very handsome guy, he's well liked by everyone he meets. 

Yesterday, I took him to my parents house, and some family friends were in town for the holidays.  There were four children there ranging in ages of 8 to 15. These are very good children. Well behaved and not at all rambunctious. Their mother is allergic to dogs, so they don't have much experience with them, but they approached him cautiously and one at a time to introduce themselves. Jake was noticeably uncomfortable at first, but warmed up in not much time.  

What I realized was that although I am doing my best to socialize him properly, children concerned him because they were new to him. I want Jake to be comfortable and welcome in any setting, but I don't have any family or friends with children for him to get used to. 

Does anyone have any ideas about where I can find children who will help him learn to love them?

The other puppy ended up on its back but it looked like it was still normal puppy wrestling - no yelping, no growling. The other owner started freaking out, so I reached in to pull mine out, expecting her to grab her dog. Instead, she screamed at me and in the meantime my dog got ahold of the other dog's face skin, during which she started slapping my dog in the face. Luckily my dog only let go and I was able to separate her. 

I usually watch my dog and stay close by while she's playing with other dogs. I also try to break up play that is getting too rambunctious, since as you know some owners are okay with rough play whereas others are not. I try to find owners beforehand to make sure that they are okay with it, but this woman was standing on the other side of the park and only came running when her dog got on its back. How do you handle situations like this without before things get out of hand? They were playing fine until she began screaming and hitting. There was another situation like this at the dog park last week where a large group of dogs ended up packing up on another woman's dog, and she began screaming and hitting other people's dogs, which resulted in her getting bit really badly on the hand. Luckily today it was only my dog instead of a pack, and she was stunned enough that she just let go.

I know that the ""leave it"" command is essential at the dog park, but how do you separate dogs that are wrestling like this? Is ""leave it"" appropriate in this situation, as the dogs are clearly not focused on you?

How do you build a stronger ""leave it""? Right now our dog is great at leave it in the house, but as I've seen recently, I want to make it much stronger before we return to the dog park, if we even do return. I am strongly reconsidering it after these last two incidents. I know I am at fault for not training a strong enough leave it, but how do I move forward from leaving a treat on the ground to leaving dogs?

1342885241.0	wxcjc	What are some non-training factors that affect your dogs' behavior? 	lzsmith	17	1	26	"Hey /r/dogtraining, what are some non-training factors that affect how well your dogs learn and behave?  
   
I'll start:   
   
- diet. Depending what brand of food I feed my dog, his ability to learn varies wildly between stubbornly apathetic and enthusiastically biddable. When I feed him ""normal"" dog food (science diet, pro plan, and the like) he is really tough to train. He loses interest quickly and we both become frustrated. When he eats higher quality food, he's much more energetic and wiggly. He's perpetually nearby, waiting to see what game we will play next, always excited to learn something new.   

- exercise. Obviously, dogs who don't get enough exercise have trouble behaving. But it seems like the quality of the exercise is just as important as the quantity. If all we do is run around in the yard for a couple of days straight, he starts to get antsy and irritated. He gets a wild look in his eye, like he's ready to get into mischief. But when we go for long (5+ miles) walks or hikes that let him settle into a long-distance trot and travel some distance, it's like a switch flips in his brain and he's calm for days afterward.

Dog developed behavioural issues since owner got pregnant.	jhamilton522	18	2	2	"A co-worker has a four year old German Shepherd cross who has never had any behavioural issues before. My co-worker recently got pregnant and her dog has developed separation anxiety. The dog first started chewing everything in the house while my co-worker and her husband were gone during the day, so they tried crating her. She escaped from her crate so they built a dog run and she dug a hole and escaped from the dog run. She also chewed the siding of the house while in the dog run. My co-worker started getting up in the morning to walk her, in addition to evening walks, thinking that she needed more exercise, but that made no difference. She has met with two different trainers and a vet and the dog was put on medication to help with separation anxiety, but nothing has helped.

The behavioural change started when my co-worker got pregnant so she strongly believes that is the reason why, as nothing else in their environment changed.

Does anyone have any advice or experience with helping dogs work through owner pregnancies?

1375978468.0	1jyoiz	Dog shuts down during training at my house	tomatolizard	19	1	12	"She seems okay when training at the training location, like it is more exciting. 

Here are the issues: 

1. She gets frustrated if I am not rewarding her for a behavior that has previously been reinforced, like if I am ""moving to the next level"" 

2. When teaching her new things, she offers previously reinforced behaviors and stops ""playing with me"" when I do not reinforce those behaviors. 


For example, she begins to look at me blankly when teaching her ""sit pretty"" or ""hold it"" because I am now waiting for longer duration holds and sits. She will sit immediately, look at me, then lay down and ignore me. In the middle of training, she will offer a ""bow"" or a ""be ashamed"" and leave when those are not reinforced. 

Today, I was trying to teach her to move around a baton. She left the room and went to lay on her bed. She wouldn't get up. She was completely shut down. 

A note on my training: I do not use NRM when teaching tricks like I am. And I reinforce a lot and do the ""happy babble"" voice. 

I can't figure out what I am doing. I am getting frustrated because this continues to happen. I keep my sessions short and upbeat, and stop before it gets to me. 

So now we have like one minute training sessions where she gives up and so do I. I have resolved to temporarily stop because it is becoming not fun and I don't want to have that history in the mix. 

I guess I need help training her to ""keep going!"" when things are frustrating.

He has an obsessive Licking problem that is driving me and my girlfriend nuts. 

Was less of an issue before, because the old girlfriend thought it was cute, so he would lick her. I can't stand it, neither can the new girlfriend. 

If permitted, he will lick someone/something for 20+ minutes, until the muscles in his tongue get tired and then he'll just press his tongue against you and pull it away. 

He licks my couch, his fabric toys, and my bed if I let him up. Not just a few licks, a ton. 

I hate it, but aside from saying ""no licking"" which will work for about 5 minutes, if he's excited around my girlfriend he'll just come right back and start licking her again, she doesn't really wear any creams/perfumes. And he would lick me too, but I'm not ""new/exciting"" enough. 

He also thinks that the couch is his... He won't settle on his dog bed if we're watching a movie (completely my fault) it's a 2 seater couch so if it's just me and him I let him up, and he spends his entire day there when I'm at work, I don't have a problem with this... Until I want him to leave us alone and watch TV together.

1375583087.0	1jnr94	I'm at my wits end with a client...need a fresh perspective from some other trainers. (Wall of text)	nonsensicalexis	18	1	23	"Little bit of background.  I teach positive reinforcement method classes at a pet store.

Client: 80 something year old man and his adopted mixed breed dog (he doesn't know what it is, I think it's a terrier mix.) He has a part time job and works about 15-20 hours a week.  His wife is on oxygen, and can't get around much, she is unable to attend the classes since they are at the store where I give lessons.  (In my opinion...they shouldn't have this dog, they aren't really equipped to take proper care of it.)

The dog is 2 years old, and is a ""rescue"".  He was taken from a hoarder's home where he was found covered in fleas and was malnourished. He was at a shelter for awhile after being taken from the hoarder's home, and got back up to a normal weight. He is not at all treat motivated or toy motivated.  He is shy.  It's taken me 3 classes to even be able to approach the dog.  He can't be around other dogs.  He doesn't know his name and he doesn't know any commands. 

My problem is not so much with the dog as it is with the owner.  I've had difficult dogs before, but it's easier to work with them when the owner cooperates.  This guy however...

In our first class together, I discovered he's been feeding his dog Friskies canned cat food.  I tried to explain to him that it was a cat food and is not healthy for dogs. It's too high in protein, and it's the reason his dog has constant diarrhea.  He insists that the can says dog food.  I even picked up a can of the shelf in the store and showed it to him.  There's a cat on the can and everything.  Nope.  Still insisted it was dog food.  In the second class last week, I tried showing him some dog food that was comparable in price (even though it's lower quality dog food, at least it's dog food...).  He didn't want to hear it.  Today, in our third class I again tried explaining why he should switch him off of it.  Smiled and nodded at me, but he's still not going to switch him to dog food.  


Oh, but it gets worse.


He told me in the first class his end goal for the class was to have his dog sit when he is told and to have him respond to his name.  

These are usually things we cover and work on in the first two classes anyway, so it's not a big deal, right?  

Noooooope.  His dog is not treat motivated at all.  I tried everything from several different kinds of soft treats, to hot dogs, to freeze dried chicken, to lunch meat, to cheese, peanut butter, etc...nothing.  No interest. He is not toy motivated either.  

However, he does respond well to touch and to verbal praise.  Again, I've worked with dogs like this before, and they need LOTS of verbal praise every single time, almost more than you would think is necessary.

In the class, we've gotten him to sit about 50% of the time that the command is given, because I am constantly having to remind the owner to praise him each time.  Each week he comes back, the ""sit"" command is completely forgotten.  This is either due to a lack of practice at home, or the fact that he's probably not praising him every time.  I've stressed each class how important it is that he praise him and make a big deal each time because it's the only way the dog will eventually make the connection between the command and the action.

One other think I've tried in the class to make it easier on him, was having him sit at the table, and put a mat up on the table, and the dog on the mat.  That way the dog was at his level (since he's unable to get down to the floor to work with the dog at his level).  This is really the only way we've had any success with ""Sit"".

We've also been working on getting him to come when called.  Usually, we do a call back and forth type game in the class with the owner and myself, where we call him back and forth, and pet/praise/treat each time the dog responds.  Since the dog is nervous around me ( and pretty much everyone else for that matter), I'm unable to get him to come to me during the class.  He will go to his owner when called about half the time.  The other half, he runs around the room in circles directly in front of his owner.  I've also asked him to work on name recognition at home by calling him by name, and rewarding him with praise and pets whenever he looks.  

This is another thing that is clearly not being practiced.  Each week we are back to square 1.  

Finally, he wants the dog to stop pulling on the leash when he takes him for a walk.  Today I suggested we walk around the store and out on the sidewalk.  He thought it was a good idea.  We get his harness and leash on...and he sits down.  

""Wouldn't you like to come?""  
""Oh no thanks, I'll just sit here.""

I told him it might be helpful if he came along to try some loose leash walking techniques for when he walks him...

""Oh no, you can just practice with him, I'll just wait here.""

Since the dog was already on the harness, I took him for a quick walk around the store.  He doesn't actually pull all that much, and after about five minutes of walking with him, he was walking nicely at my side around the store.  Went back into the room, and I explained a few of the techniques I used, and asked him if he would practice them that week.  ""Oh no, I'll just let you walk him around here to practice.""  

I tried to explain that it has to be consistent from person to person.  He's going to revert to his habits of (barely) pulling without his owner working with him.  But, as always with this guy, in one ear and out the other.  He's not going to work on it.




I don't know what else to say to the man at this point.

He probably shouldn't have the dog.  I highly doubt the dog is getting enough exercise, and this poor thing has gone from one really bad home into another slightly less horrible home.  

I've had the conversation with people before about re homing their dog.  I'm usually not afraid to have that conversation when it's necessary.  With this guy though...I don't think it'll have any effect.  He just does not listen.  I have never felt like I wanted to drop a client before, but with him, I'd rather just refund him for his three weeks.  Nothing is being accomplished.  However, that's not an option for me because I work in a retail pet store.  Even if I didn't, I don't think I'd actually go that route.  I don't want to give up on him, but it's becoming very difficult to stay with it.  

I'm turning to you guys, and please give me your honest opinions.  How would you deal with this client?"	t5_2r067	True

1375212654.0	1jdan3	I am confused about high value treat logistics.	sugarhoneybadger	20	4	32	"This is going to be a long one, sorry...!

I have been trying to work more clicker training into our lives, but every time I get started, I hit a brick wall. My dog already knows basic OB, so the things I am trying to teach her (focus around other dogs, reliable recall) require really high value treats. The suggestions I have read all say things like ""use something your dog absolutely loves- not likes, LOVES."" I am having a really hard time finding treats that *stay* high value once I have introduced them, and I wonder if I'm doing something wrong. I also can't figure out how much I am supposed to be feeding, and whether or not I should be rewarding certain behaviors with food, how often, etc.

We usually train on our walks. For focusing on me better, I started to click and treat every time my dog would look at me. This worked great except I couldn't figure out what kind of reward to use: if I use low value rewards (dog treats), she will gradually stop caring. But if I use high value rewards, they don't seem to have as much ""oomf"" when we encounter a distraction. After 2-3 days they become medium-value rewards, and finally have the same status as her normal treats.

I also can't figure out how often I should be clicking. I had a trainer tell me I was over-treating her and she was confused because she didn't know why she was being rewarded (in other words, didn't understand that she was supposed to *actively* focus on me when there is a distraction, not just glance over every once in a while for a treat). I had another trainer tell me I needed to click and treat every single time she looks at me until the ""autowatch"" behavior is solid. But if I did that, I think she would rapidly lose interest in the treats. It also seems to make her really scatter-brained and she forgets basic things like not pulling on the leash and not darting all over the place when I give her a steady stream of treats. 

The other problem I am having is the sheer amount of food this seems to require, since she gets three walks a day and frequently goes downtown and to the park with me where there are lots of distractions. I was told to use about 25 treats per session. So, 25 x 3 x 7=525 treats per week, and that's *just* for walks! That's 10.5 pouches of Trainer's Choice treats at $5 each for a grand total of $52.50 per week. Nope. Not gonna happen. I do make my own treats sometimes and buy the Natural Balance logs, but things like round steak and chicken get expensive and NB is pretty low value for her. Is this trainer just insane or something? Here's another bonus problem: my dog is borderline low thyroid and has trouble keeping weight off. I can't actually feed her that many food rewards without jeopardizing her health. To top it all off, she is already uninterested in dog food in general, so I can't just use her kibble.  

I'm not trying to knock clicker training at all, I just really want to do it right! I have a suspicion that I just don't have the best ratio of clicks to good behaviors quite yet, and that I need to figure out how to correctly place the higher value treats where it really counts. So, how do I keep the high value treats as a GREAT reward without overfeeding? How do I reinforce ""foundation"" behaviors like walking politely and checking in without a ton of food rewards?

EDIT: Guys, thank you SO MUCH for all the awesome advice! It is truly helpful. I'm going to try the ""trail mix"" approach with her treats, use some of her kibble, and cut back her daily rations at meal times so that she gets most of it during training. Also, great ideas for cheap training treats! It sounds like these small tweaks should solve the problems I'm having with food rewards.

My girlfriend's dog, Blue, is a Rott/Beagle mix, approximately 3 years old.  She's had him since he was about a month old, and has a generally sweet, kind demeanor.  He used to only get defensive if someone tried to take his chew toys.

My girlfriend lives at her parents' house right now.  Her mother runs a daycare for children ages 1-10 or so.  Blue is usually left on the side of the house, which I'm sure annoys him but he is usually calm about it.  He did bite one child a couple years ago in self defense when the child kept hitting him and pulling his tail. 

However, this all changed a couple weeks ago.  Blue was having trouble pooping because something was blocking his sphincter.  GF's mom told GF to hold Blue from the front while the mom extracted the blockage. Blue (perfectly reasonably) reacted in pain and bit GF on both hands, with her having to get 9 stitches, and probably facing tendon damage.  This in and of itself would merely be an unfortunate accident, but he seems to have become more aggressive since then. 

Three nights ago, GF's mom was petting Blue on the back porch (on his back, nothing strange) when he jumped up, bit and pierced her lip, and then bit her hand as well.  This unprovoked attack is what is scaring us.  GF's dad panicked and went to go get a gun, but mom talked him down.  

If it was just GF, mom and dad, we might be able to figure this out.  But with all the children present in the house, there are too many risks and liabilities.

GF and mom don't want to euthanize Blue.  We all love him and can't bear the thought.  But we don't have the money for the necessary training, and GF can not consistently be there to train Blue by herself since school is starting soon (not to mention her hands are out of commission).  Every no-kill shelter we call says they won't take him because of the bite history.  We don't want to lie about it either and make it so someone else gets bit down the line.  

I just don't know what to do at this point.  There've been plenty of tears from everyone, but we need to figure this out.  I live in Chino Hills, California, so I'm close to LA.  If anyone has any solution, PLEASE let me know.  I'm at a loss right now.  "	t5_2r067	True

I have a 9 month old lab mix that I have had for about 7 months now.  I used to have really shitty walmart couches in my apartment so I didn't mind her jumping up on them.


My girlfriend just moved in and brought along her nice couches and we don't want her up on those.  Prior to the move I had been working on a ""get down"" command and she understands that but not that getting up on the couches is something we don't want her to do in the first place.


If we aren't paying attention she will set up shop on the couches and we have to command her to get down when we catch her.  When we do command her to get down she also gets riled up and sometimes springs back and forth between the couch and ground a few times.  I am worried she thinks that it is a fun game to play and not something we are trying to correct.


To that end, I haven't tried any negative reinforcement apart from saying the ""down"" command in a stern voice.


Do you folks have any recommendations for keeping the dog off the couches?  Probably noteworthy that she doesn't have an soft alternative (hardwood floors and she does not have a bed in her crate due to chewing issues).

**NEW TO REACTIVITY?**

If you are new to the subject of reactivity, it means a dog that displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, people, or other triggers. The most common form is *leash reactivity*, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!

1374163394.0	1ikdpc	Transitioning out of crate	gotcatstyle	21	5	11	"I think my dog is about ready to transition from being crated whenever I have to leave him home alone, to being allowed to roam the house. I could use some advice, both on making it a smooth transition and on being certain that he's really ready. He'll be 2 in November.

What makes me think it's almost time:

* He's consistently been making good choices - i.e. seeking out one of his toys, not my shoes or pillows, when he wants to chew something
* I have left him alone for short, ~20 minute stints outside the crate while I worked outside, and he's been perfect
* His destructive tendencies seem to be over - he has three soft toys that he's had for a few weeks without ripping them apart, when he used to tear the stuffing out of anything soft within ten minutes

I realize that being left home alone outside his crate will be new and potentially stressful, so he could relapse into destructive behavior. But he is now used to short periods of being alone without the crate, so I'm thinking we're almost there. I've also heard it said that if a dog is going to be destructive when left alone, he'll do it within the first 15 minutes... is there any truth to that at all?

1373300695.0	1hvdw8	Dog aggression/reactivity vs. predatory drift	sugarhoneybadger	16	0	10	"I am slowly but surely trying to unpack my dog's confusing behaviors around other dogs, and today I came across the concept of ""predatory drift"" which actually explained a lot. I have a large dog with very high prey drive towards small animals and deer, and while she will sometimes react defensively on leash towards strange dogs by barking, most of her actually *dangerous* behavior has not looked like defensive aggression at all. Rather than giving any warning, she will quickly stalk, chase, grab, and bite, especially with very small dogs the desire to chase is strong. We have stopped letting her interact with other dogs because I simply cannot risk this happening. The weird thing is, she has been to the dog park numerous times in the past, and while she showed excited/aroused behavior, never had any problems playing with large dogs although she is definitely a rude greeter. If I called her away to calm down, she would rejoin the ""pack"" and have a great time.  

So, from what I have read, a truly dog-aggressive dog is aggressive to their target/triggers in all situations. If they are not, it's probably some other type of aggression like barrier frustration or resource guarding. It also seems to be interpreted as a fear response, usually. My dog doesn't seem afraid of other dogs- if anything she wants to check them out and finds them attractive, but also anxiety-provoking in some scenarios.

Is it possible we're dealing with TWO different types of behavior here? From what I can tell, she has very low thresholds around other dogs. So I think maybe what I have witnessed is the following:

Low threshold + barrier frustration (leash) = reactivity (barking/lunging)

Low threshold + prey drive = predatory drift (trying to hurt small dogs but giving no warning)

In Pat Miller's The Power of Positive Dog Training, she says that predatory drift can happen when the size differential is as small as 15-20 lbs. The largest dog mine has tried to hurt was about 40 lbs smaller than her... She is just so big that *everything* seems smaller than her. 

Does this make any sense? Should I be treating her aggression issues any differently, or is the usual routine of BAT/counter-conditioning still the best option? It seems like the common denominator is having a low threshold and becoming overexcited easily, so maybe focusing on calmness is the best route? "	t5_2r067	True

**NEW TO REACTIVITY?**

If you are new to the subject of reactivity, it means a dog that displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, people, or other triggers. The most common form is *leash reactivity*, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!

1371889157.0	1guirx	At my wit's end...nothing I do or have tried is working.	Tailas	19	4	38	"My dog Loki has been a problem dog from the very beginning. He is four years old, and can be a great dog sometimes, but he does not respect me or my position as his owner. I have worked long and hard trying to train him, but nothing works. I cannot afford a professional trainer, so I do not know what to do.

First, let me say my dog is not aggressive or mean. He is a very sweet dog most of the time, but he does not listen to me. He seems to only respond to commands when he wants to. I do no hit him or beat him, but I feel like I am getting close, and I am afraid. He is afraid of EVERYTHING...loud noises, cars people, children, infants, other dogs, cats, etc. I take him out all the time, but he is still afraid of his own shadow. If he thinks he's in trouble, he runs from me and will not come when I call him.

He constantly steals food from the table, the counter, from the hands of my young nephews, and I cannot get him to stop. He will get into the trash even if there is fresh food in his bowl. If I am looking at him, he will act like he's behaving, but as soon as my back is turned, he will misbehave at any opportunity. 

I walk him 3 times a day; in the morning before work, when I get home from work, and before I go to bed. I live in an upper floor apartment, so I have no yard for him to do his business in, so I have to walk him. But he is so finicky when it comes to pooping; if anyone walks any where near him while he is about to go, he will stop and try to run. If the grass is wet for any reason, he will not go. I've walked him for up to hours at a time, and I know he has to go because he farts audibly when he has to poop, but if conditions are not perfect, he won't go. I don't yell at him or beat him, but if he doesn't go outside, he will end up pooping, and sometimes peeing in my apartment. 

If he is in my apartment and he hears any noise, he barks loudly and non-stop for anywhere between 10 minutes to a half an hour. I have received complaints from my neighbors, and I do my best to try and calm him down, but nothing works.

The only place he seems comfortable is at my parent's house. I live only about 5 miles away from them, and I go there fairly often for dinner or other get-togethers, and I always take him with me. My parents have 3 dogs, and he gets along well with them and likes being around them, but it took almost 2 years for him to get used to my family and my parent's dogs. To this day, he still barks at my younger brother, even though he has been around and spent time with him a lot of the 4 years I have had him. 

I've tried taking him to dog parks, but all he does is lay at my feet and cower the whole time. He shakes like a leaf, and nothing I do to encourage him works. His first instinct is flight, always, even to dogs that are smaller or mellower than him. Even cats cause him to want to run away.

I've never had a dog that behaves like he does. I've never had this much trouble in my life. I love him with all my heart, but if things do not improve, I'm afraid I will have to get rid of him. I'm sorry if this is rambling or incoherent, but I literally do not know what to do any more. I'm on the verge of tears as I write this, because I love him and I want him to be my dog, but he's making want to tear my hair out in frustration. I hope what I've typed here doesn't make me sound like a bad person, because I'm not. I just don't know what to do anymore."	t5_2r067	True

It's difficult to even get him into the car, and once I do, he often pants and drools and then vomits. This doesn't appear to be motion sickness. If my kids are in the car to distract him, he's fine. Otherwise, he seems to get really anxious for some reason and throws up. It's getting seriously old because it happens about 50% of the time I take him somewhere.

It still could be motion sickness, but we think it's just nerves. What could it be about riding in a car that makes him so nervous? Is there a way to help him be less nervous? I'm getting really tired of having to clean up vomit half the times I take him somewhere.

Tips on teaching him the right way to play fetch!	dirtyredhead13	18	1	6	"So my 4 year old German Shepherd LOVES to chase any of his toys when I throw them for him. The problem is he won't bring it back. He runs almost all the way back and then will stay just out of reach and want you to chase him. The only time where he will play fetch is if I have 2 toys and toss one when he brings back the other. When he does this I always try and encourage the behavior. I've tried using treats but he is not as interested in them when we are outside. 
When we play fetch inside he is better about giving up the toy but not necessarily bringing it back still. 

I'm wondering if I should only use 1 or 2 toys to actually play fetch with, and possibly start inside where he listens better before moving outdoors with it. 
Should I get better smelling/tasty dog treats rather then just a biscuit?
Should I include a long leash at first so he knows to bring it back ?
 What should I do outdoors if he does not bring it back? Ignoring him doesn't work too well because he just lays down with it and when I approach him again he just picks it up and starts running. 

Any tips would be helpful! "	t5_2r067	True

1367841158.0	1dscru	I'm afraid he might attack	Inestri	17	3	15	"Introduction:


A year ago I adopted a dutch shepherd, he was about a year old.
Before coming to the shelter he was abandoned in the woods, hurt his leg badly and it had to be amputated.

He has been a very good dog. We haven't had any problems with him. He is very loving, gentle and calm in the house. He has some male aggression (fear based I think), and I'm trying to work on it by desensibilization.

I completed beginner and advanced obedience school (positive reinforcement school) with him. He is very bright, he learns after 2 repetitions, but isn't very food motivated nor he is crazy about toys, so it's not easy to motivate him to work.

He is not very confident around new people, doesn't like to be petted by strangers, and he gets scared easily by noises, strange new objects etc.


Problem:

**There were 3 - 4 situations that looked like an attack without a bite and he also nipped 2 of my friends.**

1) Sometimes on our walk he goes close to hands of people passing by on the sidewalk. I'm not sure if he's only sniffing them, or trying to bite them. It's also without any body language that might show aggression or fear or anything. That happens fairly often, but once, a few months ago he jumped and rammed on a man on the street. He didn't bite or growl. I was stunned!

2) Today he did exactly the same thing to a 10-12 year old boy (and that's what made me write this post, I'm beginning to worry). He also reacted to that same boy few weeks ago similary but on a lower scale.

3)He nipped 2 of my friends when they came to my house. He did the same thing on both: followed them, almost sneaked on them, and nipped them on the but/leg from behind. No marks on skin, and no warning. This happened last week. He almost did the same thing to some workers we had in the house few months ago.

All of these were without any warning!

4) He never barks at people on the street or in the park. He mostly just stares at them while they pass by. But he gets carried away by the other dogs, so once he barked at a man and pushed his hand with his muzzle. It really looked like he bit him, but he didn't.



My thoughts:


Ad 1 &amp; 2) I don't know why he does that to people on the street, but i think there was something strange about that man and boy that might scare him.


Ad 3) Two very similar situations (friends and workers): people that didn't really greet him walked confidently around the house (workers doing their job and friends carrying stuff around preparing for barbecue). I think it's just a warning: ""I don't know you, and I'm not sure about you, but just so you know, this is my house.""


Ad 4) Acted as the pack did. The problem is other dogs stop on cue, and he doesn't and has to be taken away.

What I'm planning to do:

Click and treat whenever we meet people on the sidewalk.

Wait the boy when he goes to school (stalk lol) and make him sit and stay with treats while boy passes by.


Any thoughts?

He gets along well with other dogs when they're together in a yard or at the dog park, but on a walk he pulls really hard on the leash and barks aggressively at the dogs he sees on the street. The problem is mostly with a few houses on our street with small yappy dogs contained in their front yards. I try to snap his mind out of that excited, aggressive state when he sees them with a quick tap on the neck ala the Dog Whisperer but he seems to snap right back into it after a few seconds. I also try to make him sit and calm down but he won't stay seated. His mind is still focused on the barking dogs. Help! It's very frustrating and makes walks feel like a chore.	t5_2r067	True
1366963948.0	1d55k7	Hi /r/Dogtraining! I just found out about you and have a couple issues with my Border Collie I hope you can help me with	Quiziromastaroh	16	0	9	"Hey guys,
 
I have a 2 year-old Border Collie. She's a wonderful dog, very smart and sweet. I recently started really looking into dog training and things I could do to improve both of our lives. Not because she's causing me any trouble but just because I want her to be a well trained dog. 

I started pack walking her recently and while things are going great I just can't get her to listen to my commands outside. Before this when we walked outside I used to let her run without a leash because I thought this would exercise her more. She would listen to me something but 20% of the time she would just ignore me and she used to always stay in front of me. 

Now that we're pack walking, she stays beside me and there's not much pulling from her besides when she sees a cat or another dog, but I still can't get her to listen to me. Asking her to sit is like talking to a wall and I can't get her to do it even with treats. She knows this stuff because I can get her to sit, shake my hand, play dead, etc. (simple stuff) inside just fine, with or without a treat, but outside it's like she's high on grass and won't even look at me. 

How do I get her to focus on me? We just recently started pack walking, so should I focus on this for some time until she gets the hang of it or is there something I'm doing wrong? 

One little question, any tips on how to get her to balance things of her head and catch a Frisbee? She's great at catching things in the air like tennis balls and treats but the Frisbee doesn't get much of her attention."	t5_2r067	True

But recently, my mother passed unexpectedly, and now all of family life has gone to hell. Me and my brothers would never be able to afford the house we live in now without all three of us working. My little brother needs to focus on school though, so they are looking for a new apartment for two, while I moved in with my boyfriend and his roommate (we had talked about me moving in before, it just happened much sooner than ever anticipated).

I tried to bring Sid fir the first few days, but apparently he barked the entire day I was gone at the funeral home. The landlord called and asked us to remove him, since we had not paid the pet deposit. I sent him off to stay with my cousin, who is a dog groomer who is rather good with dogs. She is going to properly crate train him for me (my brothers never kept with my training and with the first yip would let him out) but I don't know if that will solve the issue.

Further more, I can't have him in the apartment until August when he turns a year old, and a single complaint from the neighbors can have him booted. And, with me, my SO, and my roommate being full time college students, how do we handle him needing to go out during the day? I've read about indoor grass patches, but how well do they actually work? How do you train them to use it?

Then there's the issue of whether my dear pup will remember me once I can have him every day again. I'll be visiting him, but what if the little scamp likes it better being there? Especially since it will have another dog, a kid (he really loves kids, it's weird but good), and a cat.

I got him when I thought life was relatively stable, so I was not expecting this kind of upset and huge change. If at all possible, I want to keep him with me when i can, he's my little guy. But I know it may just be selfish to have him if I can't take proper care of him.

1366489384.0	1crdc7	Dog park politics	Hexarium	17	2	12	"How (and should I) can I tell a person at a dog park that he and his dog probably need training?

Context: Went to a new dog park this week. My pup was really happy to play with all the new dogs, and especially with this new pit mix one, since she's one too. The problem is not with my dog and this is why I am reluctant to interfere, but I think it can potentially be armful for other dogs or people.

This dog gets so into play that sometime it will almost attack his master when he tries to make him leave or just interact with him. Yesterday, the dog ripped of his owner jacket jumping on him and it didn't look playful at all. The owner welled, kicked and force a submission lay down and then did a time out (while cursing at the dog, anyway...). 

Sorry for the long intro, my question is how far can I go about telling the owner about good trainings techniques. I tried to let him know that submission technique may not be the best for his dog and suggest he looked out for positive reinforcement training and/or trainer, but can I do more than that?

I'm really sad because my dog and his really like each other and I'm afraid the dog behavior will escalate badly (he's only like 10 or 11 months old.) Anyway, what would you do in a situation like this or how would you react if someone new at a dog park starts giving you unsolicited advice about your training)?

When he was a puppy, it was so bad that as soon as I left his side, even if he could still see me, he'd start screaming. I'm talking screaming bloody murder very, very loudly.

I never indulged the screaming and went about my business as usual and eventually, months later, screaming when I left his side stopped. I was so glad because I live with my in laws and they hate dogs as is. When crate training started, the screaming started again but he caught on pretty soon and even loved his crate(still seems to and will quite often spend some time napping in there). After 2 out of town trips this last year he stayed with my parents and both times has come back screaming. 

No problem, I thought, I'll just do quick refresher sessions with him. I thought the problem was taken care of but my brother in law has told me multiple times this month that my dog is screaming and keeping him up(he works odd hours and sleeps days sometimes and nights others). I've read articles. I've read multiple dog training books. Watched dvds and youtube videos. I've tried making his crate as comfortable as possible with lots of soft bedding and toys to play with. I've left treats in there while I'm away. Every time he goes in of his own accord he gets a treat. I feed him every single day meals in his crate(he enthusiastically runs into his crate as soon as it's meal time). I've tried increasing the amount of time (5, 10,15,20,30 minutes) he spends in there while I ignore him and go about my business with the crate door closed.

Friday he scratched the walls so hard while I was out that his paws bled. He hasn't scratched since they've healed but I'm worried he will do it again. He's never had interest in toys in his crate if I'm leaving or not. He only likes playing while outside of the crate.

This Saturday, everyone was out of town so I decided it would be the perfect time to redo training and go full speed ahead. I am at my wit's end because the screaming is worse than I thought it was. I've tried everything I can imagine as mentioned above. I spent 2 whole days training most of the day. Yesterday and today it's been intermittent training sessions as I'm busy. At 5 minutes he starts to whine and that's the most success I've gotten with no noise at all. 

If he's in any longer, he will softly whine and I can hear him pacing. The most I got with no screaming was 25 minutes but he whined almost the entire time.

(x-post from r/puppy101)	thepuppygauntlet	18	0	16	"I have two young kids 3 &amp; 2, did not plan on getting a dog until they were school aged, but the ""perfect"" dog fell in our lap, so here I am!


Adopted a ~6 month old lab x and I feel like I'm trying to teach so much at once. She nips/mouths (lightly... for now), jumps, chews on everything, puts her paws on top of everything (couch, bed, table etc.) and gets overly excited. She is actually a pretty calm dog most of the time and even calms down pretty quickly after getting really worked up. She rarely barks and is generally happy just lounging about, however with the kids around they obviously excite her every hour or so just being kids.


I'm worried that I'm overwhelming her with trying to teach her many things at once. During the day I have her leashed to me, in her crate, or gated off to eat. However I find myself frequently saying ""off"", ""leave it"", ""sit"", &amp; ""her name"". Is this bad to do outside of our normal training sessions since I don't have treats?


Mainly she only jumps/nips me (since she is leashed to me and can't often jump on a kid), and I just turn away from her and ignore her, but then she will start gnawing on a chair leg, the carpet, her leash, whatever is nearby, I usually will just grab the nearest toy and put it under her nose, is that counter productive?


I don't want her leashed to me forever! I am slowly teaching both kids the ""off"" command and ""stop"" + turn around (for when the dog is too excited or they no longer want to play). The older one does well with both commands, but there really is no good way to stop a 2 year old from running around. Also, she had a sister dog she grew up with at a foster home so I'm guessing she thinks my kids are puppies?


My house is pretty much dog/child proof and I put away/gated off any areas that housed child toys. We don't leave food on any surfaces &amp; the dog is crated during kid meals.


How can I exercise her with the kids around? Walks are out of the question for exercise since we can only practice loose leash walking 1-2 times a day with a lot of starting + stopping.

I could write a ton more specifics if needed! Most everything I've read is dealing one-on-one with the dog, or no mention of kids, however unless I crate her for all day until the kids go to bed she is around them."	t5_2r067	True

Now, I'm recently married and my husband and I both brought animals into our new home. The dogs get along great and there haven't been any unusual circumstances between the two. However, my husbands dog is unlike any other dog I've ever met. He's a mix (I think shiba inu/akita mix) and he's adorable. He's great with us and fantastic with other dogs but there have been some problems that I haven't been able to wrap my head around.

It almost seems like he's ""not there."" He always has vacant look on his face and seems to lack domestication. He goes to the bathroom inside, barks constantly, has tried to attack children and has gone after a few adults (mostly resource guarding). We have brought him to another trainer friend of mine who suggested that we manage the situation, which we have been doing fairly successfully.

But, here is the problem. We have a new nephew so he's not allowed over to my MIL/FIL's house anymore because the baby is there and we are getting ready to start a family of our own. I think our best option is for him to go live somewhere else (I NEVER thought I'd even remotely consider giving an animal away) because I am at my wits end. Nothing works with him. He doesn't respond to any reinforcement.  He doesn't obey anybody's rules, not even his own.

He's totally unpredictable.

I guess I'm not sure what to do. I ethically don't believe I could give him away knowing how many issues he has, but I don't really know if I can - as a trainer - give up on him. Do any of you have any suggestions? He has become the biggest stressor in our lives and I really just don't know what to do. Help!"	t5_2r067	True

My husband and I adopted a lab mix puppy nearly two months ago and her training is going very well. She hasn't had an accident in the house in days, she doesn't whine in her kennel anymore and she has mastered sit, lay down, giving paw, and 'leave it.' Aside from her excessive barking and growling when people walk by or knock on our door, she's very good (I'll probably ask for barking advice in another thread to keep this one on topic).

I've taught her to sit and put a paw on my lap when she needs to go potty instead of whining and it's working wonderfully. It's working so wonderfully, in fact, that she asks to go outside every hour. We live on the third floor of an apartment building so I must walk her down, wait (she's very picky about where she poops), and walk her back up every time. I work from home and this is becoming a huge distraction. I didn't mind it much when we were still potty training her, but now I need her to learn how to hold it for a while. I've been distracting her with toys after she asks the first time, but it doesn't buy me much time. I know she's still a pup, but is she capable of holding it at this age? If so, how do I train her to hold it just a little bit longer?


Edit: Ok so I'm going to try to take a bit of everyone's advice: feed and water on a tighter schedule, more kennel time while I'm working, going to start taking her out on a schedule whether she asks me to go or not and elongating the time between trips, longer morning and evening walks.

We can't let him off leash because when we do, he does not respond and simply runs after the other dogs. 
I tried getting his attention with treats but he will ignore them (he is food motivated in other situations). Standing in front of him doesn't help either.. I also tried to walk into the other direction but he will stand still and whines and I have to pull him.
I'm using clicker training for other things, but I can't reward good behaviour near other dogs because he never is good in those situations..

I guess I'm just not interesting enough but I don't know how to get his attention..
I've been reading quite a lot on the internet and I keep watching videos, but nothing seems to be working..
I'd appreciate every response and every tip! :)

(he really loves people, so he just wants to get up and play)	Mythic514	18	3	13	I will be getting married in June, and my fiancee and I want to have our dog as the ring bearer. This means that ideally he will walk down the aisle and then sit up at the front with the groomsmen. However, as the title says, he just really loves people, so he always gets antsy and just wants to play with everyone. How can I train him to at least sit there patiently? It would be a plus to also get him to walk down the aisle by himself (I let him off the leash at times, and he won't run off, but he hasn't fully been off-leash trained yet). Thanks!	t5_2r067	True

We (m21,and me f22) found this pitbull mix in the shelter and he was so sweet. The whole shelter was filled with barking, but this pit was only sitting in his cage starring at us. We adopted him after being in a room in the shelter for about 10 min. He has average behavior status and is not aggressive against other dogs or humans. The first 2 days were really nice with him. He still did not bark at all. His ears were telling me he is a bit nervous though. We are living with other people in the house and he got introduced to all of them - some briefer then others. When me or my partner would leave the room he's in he started whining, so we told him ""no"" and send him to his place. This whining grew into a solid dark bark on the next day. Today I wanted to pet it like I usually do. So i knee down to him and he has trust in me now, he lays on his back waiting for me to give him affection. After I was done petting him he didn't want to back off so I pushed him a little and said ""no"". I was still sitting on the floor next to him so his head was right next to my face and he barked. A high pitched but not loud bark. I was really scared.. I read and watched much stuff about body language of dogs and I still don't know why he barked at me. I told him to stop and he still kept going so I got up looking down at him but he didn't stop... only when I told my partner to say his name he turned away from me. Not a sec later his tail was wagging like nothing happened. The dog is 2 years old and I have no idea what the previous owner did with or to him. I am afraid that any sound or movement I make could trigger something in him. Any help is welcome.

1358716129.0	16y4we	Have to share mindblowing nailclipping progress + question how to continue from here. 	Minna93	16	1	15	"A little more than a year ago I got my AmStaff/Rottie Lady. She was terrefied of nail clipping. So terrified that when she saw clippers, she fled. Once I made the incredibly dumb mistake of trying to hold her just so she could be close to the clippers but of course I just made everything worse. **If I tried to hold her paw in one hand while holding the clipper she'd snap at my face.** 

I've tried putting the clippers casually around the house where she can see them every day but for instance she wouldn't eat if the clippers were in the same room... 

I've tried counter conditioning but she wouldn't take any treats. I tried raw meat, cheese, meatballs, pretty much anything she'd be happy to steal from my fridge if she got the opportunity, but she was just too stressed to eat anything around those damned clippers. 

***So, success story time!***

I recently read Don't Shoot the Dog by Karen Pryor and in the chapter about negative reinforcement she talks about shy llamas. The way people train the llamas not to run away is to reward not running by going away themselves. Kind of like BAT training. So I tried this with the clippers, just showing them to her and before she had the time to react I'd put them away. Soon She'd stand till next to me while I sat on the floor holdin them, them putting them away and petting her. 

It's been a week and I can touch the clippers to her claw while holding it. I can even put the clippers around her claw for a few seconds. Holy shit you guys. She just stands **perfectly still** and waits for me to stop and put the clippers away. If I would show this to her previous owner they'd probably believe I'd drugged her or something. This has been gnawing on my conscience since I bought her and finally I can see some progress. It's god damn amazing. 

So my question is, how do I move on from here? I don't know how to start acually clipping - I'm afraid that will undo the training. So far she's been rewarded for standing still by me removing the clippers out of her sight but if I'd actually clip a nail she'd be punished for standing still. What to do? Try and counter condition it again? Treat jackpot for a clipped nail? She'd probably take treats by now, I havn't really tried it yet though. 

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the great tips and feedback! I made this post in the middle of the night right before going to sleep and just thought I'd add some things I didn't think of before, just to be a bit more specific on my method for those of you who may want to try this. 

I've been doing two sessions a day, that is one before each meal she gets. So we've been doing this stuff for 5-10 minutes and then I give her the command to go to her bed and lay down (which she always does when I prepare her food) and I let her know there's delicious BARF goo coming her way. That way, when we're done, she gets to go 1:Run away to someplace safe and 2:relax for a minute and anticipate her meal, which I hope has been a pretty strong reinforcer as well. 

This morning I started the whole thing from the beginning using tiny bits of cheeze (as to follow a normal counter-conditioning process), and she totally gobbled  them down like her normal, food-motivated self. I'm just so happy I probably won't be taking her to the vet to trim her nails anymore. High five everyone! 

**ANOTHER EDIT:** I'm totally cutting like two nails per day now. I'll totally do an update post in a couple of weeks or so. Thanks so much again for the awesome advice! Awesome! "	t5_2r067	True
1356083450.0	157ym9	My puppy loves cats... a bit too much!	Carysilicious	18	2	17	"Hey guys!

Sorry for wall of text. **TL;DR: My dog thinks cats are awesome and wants to play with them, the cats party outside my windows. How do I calm my dog down without closing the shutters and living in the dark for the rest of his life?**

I've had a now 7 month old labrador mix for about a month and a half, and I think we're doing quite well. But there's one thing I just can't seem to curb, and that's his love for cats. I think he thinks they're mini dogs, and he wants to play with them. Anyhow, it would be ok if we were just coming across random cats on walks, but two little kittens were born in June/July in my yard, and they were so thin when their mother left them that I started feeding them on my little terrasse bit of the yard. So now they're used to hanging out right outside my French windows. 


The problem is that when they're around, Mistral will go ballistic, licking the windows, biting the frames, barking, whining, and crying. And the cats don't help because when they see him, they paw at the windows.


So far, I've been reinforcing (clicking and treating) calm behaviour like sitting or lying down when they're outside, and when he barks I close the shutters. But we don't seem to be making any progress. Just recently I've started feeding the cats the other side of the yard to try and discourage them from coming, and I've put loads of pepper/rosemary/vinegar stuff outside the windows, but they don't seem to mind that much! I only have one big room downstairs, and Mistral doesn't know how to go up the stairs, so putting him in another room isn't possible. Also, we live in France, and crate-training would be considered cruelty to animals, so that's not an option.

Anyhow, if you have any advice, thoughts, whatever, I'd love to hear them. And to thank you for reading all this, here is [a video of Mistral with his first piece of carrot!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNpeIQH61j8). And [a picture too](http://i.imgur.com/Qe5A5.jpg) from when he was 5.5 months old and where you can see a cat sneaking up on him!

Bonus question: any idea what breed/s is/are mixed in with the labrador bit?

Thanks so much for reading!

We've asked him several times to stop and it has finally come to a head where we are putting our foot down and making it clear that if he wants to continue our friendship he is going to have to stop.  What would help me greatly is if anyone could help me find research articles that address the following:

The efficacy of positive reinforcement techniques

The negative effects of hitting/ negative techniques.

I'm looking for actual research articles, not opinion pieces or sites as those wont be effective.  We would like to be able to continue the friendship, if we could convince him to stop then that would allow us to.  Any help you guys could give would be very much appreciated.

**Edit: I'm going to go ahead and address some of the comments (since a lot of them are in the same general topic) here.  First thing to note is that he has been told to stop, I am not negotiating or convincing him to stop, it has been made clear that it is our dog and our choice.  This is an attempt to convince him so that the friendship has been maintained.  Secondly, he was raised with a different approach in terms of the treatment of dogs, I think it's important to understand that.  I don't fault him for his approach, I fault him for the fact that he is not allowing us to make our own decisions about how our dog is trained.  This goes to the third point, he is a friend but he can also sometimes struggle with this sort of thing, sometimes he doesn't realize that others get to make their own decisions and sometimes he has a hard time letting people do that...everyone has quirks and you need to be willing to work with them to some degree.

For those of you who gave legitimate help on this, thank you.**"	t5_2r067	True

He's only allowed on-lead walks until his ear has fully healed (to avoid shaking of his head, and attempts to rub bandages off), which is likely to be at least 2 weeks.  

He's normally very active, and I'm pretty sure he's going to be bouncing off the walls before the end of this.  There is no way I can give him long enough on-lead walks to tire him out, and its meant to be rainy which means he can't go out at all.

Anyone have any suggestions of things I can do to keep him occupied while he's on limited exercise?  

He is clicker trained, and we have done a fair amount of free shaping, but my imagination is useless and I can't think of anything good to work on.  We also do agility, so any ideas of foundation work that might help that doesn't require too much movement would also be good.  

He's not allowed kongs since he ate one (yes, the actual kong, not the filling) and ended up at the vets with an intestinal blockage, but I'm trying to come up with something else similar to keep him busy and make him use his brain to get food.

EDIT: Thanks for the ideas.  I definitely have lots of things I can try :)  [Logan](http://i.imgur.com/DfTaM.jpg) says thank you too."	t5_2r067	True

1341761335.0	w81wc	Petrified rescue dog. Tried a few local trainers and nothing is working. Help please!	chubbswife	17	1	16	"I am sorry if this post is a little hard to follow. I am typing while pretty upset...


We adopted a 6 week old puppy (Starbuck) about a year ago from a local rescue. Her mother was found pregnant wondering on the side of the road in Florida. The mother got adopted and soon after all the puppies were adopted. 



I got a call from the rescue 3 months ago. The mother had been given back due to her fear issues. We went to meet her, and I ended up telling the head of the rescue we would keep her. She was so happy to see her daughter again that I just couldn't separate them.



We got her home and began working on some of her issues. She is obviously petrified of men. She runs hides and begins whimpering. I have had no luck with my husband getting through to her. She is still shy. We have tried working with a male trainer on this, nothing came of it.



Another factor is that we have found multiple cigarette burns on her. As well as a few scars from gashes. She cowers when I go to pet her sometimes. 



But the kicker on this whole story started 4th July. I expected her to be shaky but when the night came round it was a whole other ordeal. She was almost convulsing, even with a thunder shirt and some Benadryl down her. I ended up contacting the emergency vet and they eventually sedated her. It seems like she may have been hit by a firework or had some shot at her before. The vet assumed this as one of the marks almost looks like a big burn.



I sat up with her all night making sure she was breathing and hugging her until the morning. I have contacted so many trainers. Most of them want over $1000 to train her for her fears. I would pay it in a heartbeat, however, nothing seems to have worked with trainers so far so I am a little dubious.



She has finally started barking and wagging at me a little. She also has begun to come up to me on her own and started to play with her toys! One huge difference recently is that she has started to chew bones and play games with the other dogs. Mainly it is at 3am when we are trying to sleep. But any improvement is welcome at this point.


We have tried a few things to help with her fears:
1. I take her every Sunday to the pet store to buy bones. (Sadly, its just me right now and not my husband)
2. Spending some time one on one with her at night. 
3. Let her play with some of the neighborhood dogs. She loves other dogs!
4. Giving her treats for coming up to us. Again.... The problem here is getting her to accept the treats from our hands. We have been putting them close to her and hoping the other dogs dont steal them before she gets to them.

If anyone has any good advice or different techniques for dealing with a fearful dog it would be very appreciated. 

We are going to dedicate an hour per day to working with her for rehabilitation. 

TLDR:
Fearful/Abused dog.

Won’t go near Men. Shaky when hearing loud noises. Tried training with a trainer, followed through with the training and nothing works. Help needed.

1330324319.0	q7syg	This weekend I put on my big boy pants and figured out if I wanted to be a trainer or just simply a man who liked playing with dogs.	Devlik	19	1	4	"I had a put up or shut up weekend with the dogs at the local shelter I donate time to. Just some back ground I am an intern with the canine behavior team at the second largest shelter in my state. I have had a good amount of experience with guardian breeds especially those that have severe behavior issues ranging from fear aggression to kennel stress to simple house breaking issues.

So one of my favorite dogs at the shelter turned into a bite case as he drew blood on an intern (not out of aggression as he would have likely been put down).

 He is now out of bite quarantine and thankfully above ground. He is however, exhibiting symptoms of major kennel stress. For those that are note familiar with this, it is the dogs slowly and quite literally going insane from the stresses of a large kennel environment (constant barking, lots of people, the cleaning process, etc are all very hard on the dogs). Pit bulls especially and most bully breeds fall victim to this as they spend more and more time in the shelter. This pit bull has already bitten one person and is going nuts. This is a major killer of these dogs in shelter environments.

So what do I do? Not just work with him in the training rooms and outside but lock myself in his kennel to give him massage and work on stress reduction with him. Helping show that his kennel is not just a place of confinement but also where happy fun times and relaxation happen. This is critical in helping reduce the stress and keeping him adoptable.

So lets recap on my brilliant choice of hobby 

* 1) Work with guardian breeds almost exclusively 
* 2) Make sure they are the breeds that can really mess you up 
* 3) Find the craziest one of the lot 
* 4) wait for them to come out of bite quarantine 
* 5) lock your self in a space smaller than your closet with them in hopes you can help make him less crazy.

Either I trust my skills and these dogs or I don't and so far I am not finding my faith lacking. However I am starting to understand rock climbers, sky drivers, and other lifestyles that are bat shit crazy on paper but rewarding and worth it in the long run."	t5_2r067	True

I have a two year-old-ish lab/mastiff mix who LOVES to play. When at the dog park, if there's another dog she can't engage, she barks and barks and barks right in its face. She's a decent size (70 pounds) and my main concern is making other dog owners anxious over the safety of their dog. I'm also concerned she's going to get hurt, since other dogs can send her very clear signals (""LEAVE ME ALONE"") which she disregards. 
She is not aggressive at all, but she *is* very in-your-face and doesn't take ""no"" (from other dogs) as an answer. Once she's off-leash she's very hard to catch (we're in a fenced area) so I'm unable to discourage the behaviour (by leaving, for example).  
She's very well exercised but always has extra energy for dog annoyance. If the other dog tries to walk away she nips their back legs.  
Again, my main concern is etiquette.  
Will she outgrow this? Are there methods I can employ to curb the barking?

While my dad is getting old, I don't want to be telling him not to do any of that unless it would be detrimental to the dogs training. So my question is, is it? If so, in what ways, would it desensitize him to certain actions?

For example, Carlin knows ""high five,"" in which when I say ""high five"" and offer a vertical palm, he rears up and hits it with both front paws.

Well, yesterday, at my girlfriend's soccer game (a field which he has never been to, on a hot day during a heat wave), he met some friendly, calm children (age 7- 8ish?) who politely asked if they could play with him. Carlin LOVES kids, and is exceptionally calm with them, so I agreed. I showed the kids Carlin's repertoire of tricks, which includes high five. Then one kid asked if he could do the high five with Carlin, and I agreed, not thinking he would do it. The kid says ""high five"" in a high pitched, speedy voice (in contrast to my low, slow voice) and holds out his little palm (compared to me, at 6'3). Guess what? Carlin ""high fived"" the kid like he had been high fiving kids his whole life!

This really didn't surprise me, as he has always seemed to ""get"" things quickly, and apply them to various places/things. For example, after teaching ""up"" (which is my command for jump onto this thing) in my basement, he would jump onto a bench at the park, or a crate at the pet store, with no extra coaching.


So, this makes me wonder about other dogs. How is your dog at generalizing? Are there any trends in breeds or types of dogs? Related to intelligence or drive? What about the potential downfalls, such as generalizing tug to ALL things, not just toys, or thinking they are allowed on ALL couches, rather than a particular one.

What are your thoughts and anecdotes, I'm very curious! "	t5_2r067	True

I don't know what kind of environment he was in, but he is not house trained in any way, shape, or form. We take him out about every hour (to the same location) and he just won't go. As soon as we give up and bring him back in (or within a few minutes) he pees inside. We keep cleaning it up and he just chooses a different spot the next time.

When we catch him in the act, we ring a bell, say ""NO!"" and take him outside to the same spot, but again, to no avail.

I think we're doing the right things, but is there anything else I should know? We have crate for him, should we be keeping him in it all the time?

1374105854.0	1iiuzn	Jumping and greeting help requested!	mstob	16	0	15	"I have 14 month old lab - male, neutered, 95lbs.  
He is a non-aggressive dog - I have never seen him get aggressive or lashout in any way (I keep waiting, but it never seems to happen), and he gets along well with other dogs (we do dog park daily), and is happy on walks and so forth.  He is well exercised (an hour walk in the am, a 20-30 min play time mid day, and then an hour in the dog park in the evening), and gets plenty of attention and stimulation.  He is crate trained for when we are gone (but whines at first because he would rather be with us).  

Problem - He becomes the most jumpy, out of control, crazed animal when anyone other than family comes into the house - not in an aggressive way, but in a 'OMG YOU ARE HERE AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU AND I LOVE YOU!!!"" -  He jumps, he licks, he runs around, sniffs behinds, knocks you over, licks your hair - you name it.  He settles down after about 15 minutes - by which time, most people no longer want to be in the house.  

I have tried the manners minder - and it works fine (except that he got to the pointer and chewed it up) IF I have it out and ready when someone comes to the door - which is once.  I cannot leave it out, because he would destroy it (it has food in it).  And when I have tried to put it out when someone comes in, he is already over stimulated and cannot redirect to the manners minder.  

Any other suggestions?  Can someone point me to a good training video?  I have friends at the dog park who use vibrating collars with their dogs and this has been suggested to me, but I would hate to use any punishment with this dog - he is just so happy and friendly - the last thing I want to do is associate people with punishment.  

TL/DR - help me give my big ol' lab some manners when new people come over!

HELP!	murdog11	16	2	13	I have a 9 month old golden retriever/german shepherd mix and he is so destructive when we leave the house!! We have tried crate training him with a metal wire cage. He drools uncontrollably to loosen the handles and escaped that way. We then, closed them with butterfly clips and he literally bent the metal bars to escape. He has injured his paw trying to get out. We threw out the cage because it was useless. He also whines and barks pretty much the entire time we're gone (our neighbors have told us). We have tried leaving him out while we're going and putting peanut butter on his busy bone to distract him, but alas, he finds anything cardboard, paper, or our shoes to tear up. We are incredibly frustrated. I was thinking about trying to get a plastic dog carrier and trying to give him peanut butter when we leave for positive reinforcement.

My pups are very lucky to live in a busy house, so they are only cooped up at night in their kennel, which they don't mind. Otherwise, they are free to roam the house or play outside (big yard), and we often take them on walks around the neighborhood or off leash at a local park. The one I am worried about has an extremely high prey drive and loves to fetch, either her frisbee or an assortment of balls in the house. 

This is all she ever wants to do, literally all day every day. She never seems to run out of energy, even after a long day of playing outside, running in the park, swimming in the pool, and then a whole night of me sitting at the foot of the couch and throwing her ball down the hall while I watch TV, which she will do for literally hours if I let her. (Her sister is a bit more girlish and prefers to chase animals around the yard and investigate things around the house and watch the neighborhood from the window like a cat.)

I have trained her so that her begging to play is not so much of an issue anymore, though I still sometimes feel guilty because she will follow me around the house and every time I stand up she gets excited thinking it is playtime again. 

I guess my concern is that she will burn herself out very young or ruin her joints or something, because she plays very energetically and loves to jump up and down off furniture or people, and when she chases her toys she often goes so fast that she will overshoot and take a tumble. Is this something I need to worry about? Will she grow out of it as she gets older? Are there any ways I can get her to be a bit more like her sister who seems to have balanced out play and relaxation and independence? I love her and don't want to change her, I am just worried about her long term health."	t5_2r067	True

First off, an American Stafford began playing with her rather aggressively. A little too aggressive for my taste: he would bite and pull from my dogs scruff to the point where she'd let out a little yelp. How do you determine when rough play goes too far? I was compelled to get her out of there and of course the other owner insisted his dog wasn't biting her, except there was clear signs of drool on her. 

Then, about 10 minutes ago two other dogs aggressively charged her and I think they were trying to bite her. My GSD was whimpering and running so I can only assume it was not playful. This being said, how should I intervene in these cases? Do I risk myself by protecting my dog, do I wait for their owners to come by?

I have a corgi that used to be great with other dogs. As a pup until he was about 2 years old he loved to play with them. He's now 3 years old. I noticed a change in his behavior last fall when he saw another dog but wouldn't let her sniff him. He didn't bark aggressively but just kind of 'woofed' when he saw her and seemed scared.

Anyway, we moved to a new place, and there weren't any dog parks nearby until this past week a new one opened up. We wanted to take him there, but needed to make sure he was fine with other dogs before we took him off the leash (he is a pretty obedient dog otherwise, great on leash, and off leash even with other people around). Well, the first dog he saw he completely flipped when they came too close. Started barking aggressively.. and honestly it looked like he was protecting me more than anything. I just couldn't snap him out of it, we had to leave.

We are parents to a 1.5 year old Frenchie who is the sweetest dog alive, loves to run and play with other dogs and is the most social thing I have ever met, except she has a couple of issues we are currently working on - barking in the house at people passing by and leash reactivity issues (all to do with excitement when seeing another dog, NOT aggression). 

I know the most sensible thing would be to wait until we resolve these issues completely, but our Frenchie was also born with a congenital disease which means her lifespan is not guaranteed - she could live another 2 years or 10. There's no way of knowing. Because of this, I would love to adopt a 2nd dog sooner rather than later. Our reasons for adopting another dog are genuine - my husband and I are dog lovers, we have the financial means for another dog despite our current dog's illness, and we would really love our dog to have a friend as she loves other dogs. Despite her shortcomings she is in good health at the moment and has lots of energy so I feel like now would be the right time if we were going to add another dog to our family. We are still actively working on her issues through positive training and have seen some improvement, but the bad habits haven't disappeared completely.

My question is, if we end up adopting another dog, what are the chances of it echoing our current dog's bad habits? Is it possible to train them separately so that we can reenforce good behavior with our new dog? Or is bringing another dog into the mix a completely horrible idea?

Any insight is greatly appreciated, thank you!"	t5_2r067	True

I'm just trying to understand the thought process behind this claim, and frankly, to make sure that the conventions we hear repeated so much in /r/dogtraining are fact- and evidence-based. :)

I keep hearing that you can't yell at a dog for something they've done while you were away because they won't know what you're yelling at them for. This argument presupposes that a dog can only connect discipline to an act that is immediately happening, but I just don't think that dogs are like goldfish who immediately forget everything they've done, and that they don't understand causal relationships enough to never be able to figure out that if you are pointing at a chewed up shoe and scolding them that he/she should stay away from shoes in the future. Of course, some dogs may be dumb, and some owners/trainers may be worse than others at getting their points across to dogs, but dogs evolved into the pets they now are over thousands of years precisely *because* they can understand how we want them to behave. It is crazy to me to think that they can't understand causal relationships because it is precisely this understanding that has brought them into our homes, if they behaved how we wanted them to, we kept feeding them and sheltering them and they lived well enough to breed etc, etc.

The second issue I have with the claim comes from behaviors of guilt that are exhibited by my dog when he's done something wrong while I was gone. **He's exhibiting these guilty (or stressed) behaviors *before I even know he's done something wrong*.** Twice, I've been in the shower and I've heard his collar jingling and looked out to see him sitting on the bath mat, head lowered, shaking, and avoiding looking at me. Both times I soon find that he's been digging in the trash. I had no idea he was doing anything until he came in shaking. I have to believe that he knew he screwed up, just couldn't stop himself, but then knew he was going to get busted.  He couldn't have possibly been reacting to me being upset that he got in the trash, because he exhibited guilt (or stress) *before* I knew anything was amiss. Other times I've come home and he's not quite as rambunctious when he greets me, and each time he has also *coincidentally*? chewed something up.

What is going on here? How can I reconcile these things with the claim that dog's don't know what we're talking about unless it is immediately happening right that moment?"	t5_2r067	True

1363878496.0	1aqh5a	How to curb dog jumping up at people?	halpinator	18	2	18	"I have a 7 month old huskie/lab that tends to jump up on people when he gets excited.  Usually when I come home from work, or if somebody else comes into the house, or if we're playing or making lots of noise, he'll jump up, paw at people, and try to nibble their hands.

In trying to maintain a ""positive training only"" philosophy, so far my strategy has been to:

* ignore him or show him my back when he jumps up (except usually this just annoys him and makes him bark and chew on my pants)
* tell him to ""get down"" when he's jumping (hit or miss, he sometimes stops but more often than not continues to jump up)
* redirect him by telling him to sit (moderately successful, he will stop and sit most of the time but often will start jumping up again shortly after)
* Gently deflect him to the floor with my knee (usually he takes this as ""oh, we're WRESTLING now?  Let's do this!"")

Most people have suggested giving him a strong knee to the chest when he jumps at people, obviously don't want to go this route unless nothing else works.  I don't want him to get into the habit of jumping on people, especially when it starts getting muddy outside, he gains another 20 pounds, and he runs the risk of flattening a child or tackling me down the stairs.

Anybody have a strategy that's worked for them?

I adopted him almost a year ago, unknown background, and he was unneutered. When I first brought him to my apartment he marked a few places, but besides that he didn't poop or just let his bladder loose inside. He also loves to mark everywhere outside as well. We ended up neutering him a week after he came home, so I was hoping it'd curb the behavior a bit. It hasn't for the outside marking.

He has separation anxiety, but it's gotten a lot better since my boyfriend and I got him. We kept him in a crate while we were gone at first until we trusted him enough not to eliminate inside (about 3 months later). Then we started leaving him out when no one was home and thought everything was going perfectly fine because we hadn't noticed any pee spots or pooping. He also didn't seem to mark anymore when we're actually present. He normally stays in the same room as us and sleeps or plays with his toys when we're not interacting with him.

Sometime around the fall of last year I actually noticed that the carpet smelled like urine...and found a few spots he apparently enjoyed marking. I didn't know when that happened, so I started to watch him more carefully and record him when we weren't home. I'm 95% sure he doesnt mark when we're home (maybe when we're sleeping? but he generally sleeps the entire night and hasn't messed up the belly band when we kept it on him for a month or so). But he does mark when we leave. It's only occasional, though. His general routine is to sleep in various parts of the living room or look outside of the balcony window. Sometimes, however, when he's moving between sleeping places he'd sniff and quickly mark a spot and continue on. He seems to like doing the coffee table legs/underneath it or something new we brought home like a styrofoam cooler. 

So after I saw him do it a few times we decided to crate him whenever we left, and that's where he is now. He also marks when he visits other houses so I normally stick a belly band on him to catch the pee.

I'm mostly wondering if there's something we can do about it. If not, then I'll stop grieving over it and just let him loose in the apartment with his belly band if we're gone for a long time.

**tl;dr: Is there any way to train him to not mark inside? It's only when we aren't there so it's hard to stop him from doing it.** "	t5_2r067	True

About 3 years ago we discovered that Farley is epileptic. He takes phenobarb (sp?) and potassium bromide to help and thankfully, he hasn’t had a seizure for over two years now. 

However in the past few months he has gotten very moody and lethargic. So much so that when I walk into the door to come home he will be laying in the living room and growling from where he’s laying. Sometimes he will bark multiple times - I’ve been taught to ignore this. I thought this may have to do with the fact that I have been working at a different school and he was unwary of the smells, but I could be totally wrong. 

 I’ve grown up with dogs as well as worked in a pet store for a while and have never mistreated him. I’ve even helped to train and walk him before his epilepsy got too bad to walk him on my own. 

 We took him to the vet and after some tests the vet decided to lower his medication to help better his mood. 

But this has taken a turn for the worse for the last few days. Now, he refuses all commands from me, regardless of any (positive) correction, and he also refuses to take his medication. I try to have him come to me so that I can give him his meds and reward him, but now I’m only met with growls that get louder and louder as I persist. If I get too close to him during these episodes, he growls even louder and his body begins to puff up. Because of his size, he'll often block the door way into the kitchen and won't budge (I once tried to get him to movie and after 45mins he still wouldn't budge). 

I’m worried there are other issues with him because it’s gotten to the point where he is refusing food. What kind of cuddly beast does not like food?


Now the dog is not actually mine. I had no say in purchasing the dog all those years ago. 

I’m going to call the vet tomorrow to see what advice he can give, but I thought I’d ask you guys to hear if any of you had any ideas about how to approach this."	t5_2r067	True

Angry_Caveman_Lawyer	16	3	31	"For me, it's that my girl Sasha is very leash reactive with 3 neighborhood dogs.  (and only these three dogs) I've tried almost everything under the sun with her on this, and still it happens.

I'm talking growling/snarling, trying to charge at them (I keep a closer to the collar grip on my leash when I see them coming) ""redirecting"" behavior--I can't get them so I'll snap at my brother, etc.

It's been 4 years of this crap.  I've gone through 3 trainers, countless books, you name it, I've tried it for at least 3 solid months at a time to with no real ""great"" results.

I bring this up not because I am asking for advice (I have a fantastic trainer now, we're making progress, 3 steps forward, 1 step back, but progress nonetheless) but because I imagine that ""behaviors you just can't seem to correct"" happen to a lot of people.

This is future thinking really, not planning on dropping treats for awhile, but it's always nice to have something else to offer to get them excited.

I've been watching her play with toys and trying to figure out if there is one toy or the other that she seems to prefer, but I haven't noticed one yet. 

My thinking is probably finding something like the Kong bones that allow you to stuff just the two ends, loading it up with something delicious, and then only using this ""loaded"" toy for when she does something really great. Let her play with it for a few moments, then return it to my pocket. This way she has limited access to it and its always exciting to see it, and can't just lay around with it in the house and get bored of it.

1361832871.0	197y2t	My family got a new dog and the only one more miserable than I am is the dog itself.  Suggestions?	Teeklin	15	0	5	"My family recently decided, after our old dog of 14 years had recently died, to get a new dog.  I rent a room in the basement and don't see much of the family so I don't know why I was surprised that they never consulted me, but they didn't and now Jack (the jack russel/border collie mix) is here to stay.  He was a rescue dog that had been abandoned by his owner and is obviously displaying some issues from the experience.

This dog is very different in personality than our old dog (who was a perfect fit) and yet no one seems to want to address any of the issues that have arisen and are steadily getting worse.

For example, our old dog (Lobo) was crate trained and had no place in the world she would rather be than in her crate.  Jack, on the other hand, wants nothing to do with his crate and has to be physically dragged in there and will whine the whole time.  Lobo was a very laid back dog, Jack is constantly full of energy.  Lobo loved being outside and we could never get her to come in, Jack refuses to stay outside longer than it takes to do his business and will whine constantly until we let him back inside.  Things like that.

The problem is that this fear of abandonment combined with this excess of energy has led to him attacking anyone that comes into the house, barking uncontrollably, and destroying things when left at home alone.   We keep him gated in to the hard wood floor areas of the house and don't let him up the stairs onto the carpet, so whenever we get into his ""area"" he will immediately start jumping around, attacking your ankles, barking, and generally being a nuisance.  When you pet him or give him any kind of attention, he will stop his excitability and will lay there happily until you stop petting him, then will resume his behavior worse than ever.

My family, however, doesn't understand that he wants attention and so whenever he barks and they are in the room they go over and pet him and whenever he barks after they leave the room they will always call out to him to tell him to shut up or will come back into the room and pet him, etc.  Basically just reinforcing the idea that every time he barks or harasses someone that he will get rewarded.

Since he has come into the house, he has eaten countless pairs of shoes and has woken up the entire house on multiple occasions with his middle-of-the-night barking.  I am at my wit's end with the dog and I need to come at my family with some kind of a plan or instructions for what to do from now on to try and curb this problem.

**TL;DR Our new rescue dog is constantly acting out for attention and I need help coming up with a plan for the family to follow to fix things.**

1361665834.0	193ut0	A Clash of Methods	potato_is_meat	16	1	34	"Today, Lady and I joined our doggie school on their outing in town. We were twenty or so people with our dogs, and we worked on things from loose-leash walking in urban environments, to duration stays, to recalls. It was an OK experience, but it lasted too long for my tastes (by the end, many dogs were antsy and Lady was mentally cooked, being only 7 months old). There were also three? different dogs who snapped and growled at her, so I had to relocate myself in the line several times so Lady would have the opportunity to calm down.

Anyway, so, I use strictly ""progressive reinforcement"" as Kikopup calls it. Lady was far too distracted and anxious to feel comfortable tugging with me as a reward, so I used my supply of chopped up hot dogs. There was one exercise where I was chastised in particular for ""treating Lady too much"", and I will explain it and see what you all think:

- Dogs sat at handler's side in heel position, handlers standing in a line with perhaps 2 metres of space in between.

- One by one, dog and handler weaves through the line of people, constantly engaging dog to keep eye contact and avoid sniffing/checking out stationary dogs/people.

- I treated Lady each and every time she successfully kept her eyes on me while we walked around a person and their dog, and when others were going, for ignoring the moving dog/handler.

- When we got to the end, I asked her for a sit at heel position, she complied, and I released her briefly and gave her a jackpot.

It was at this point that I was told I'm giving Lady far too many treats, and that if I do not stop and go back to a single treat at the END of the exercise, I will end up with a dog who does not work without treats.

My problem with this thinking is that: 1) My puppy is seven months old and this is literally the first time we did this exercise. I think for her to have given me eye contact with the help of kissy noises and cooing her name, while walking past high-level distractions, is huge - and 2) Praise is cheap, almost useless as a reward. Lady does love being showered with attention, but I know it is not enough to keep her motivated unlike toys or food.

I get that I need to phase her out of being treated constantly in the face of heavy distractions... but not on the first go, right? I'm not crazy, am I? I wanted her initial experience(s) of performing at such a level to be totally fun and amazing; I wanted to set her up for an ""easy"" success. There were lots of handlers with dogs far older than Lady, who'd been attending classes a lot longer (this is my second with her), that were struggling like mad. I saw a LOT of Malinois and Dutch and German Sheps with prong collars and heavy-handed leash yanking in order to keep their eyes on the ""prize"" of completing the exercise. A lot of, imo, TOO stern voices as well, which bothered Lady as a noise-sensitive breed. But no matter, it was a good socialising experiment.

So, what do you reckon? Was I wrong in treating Lady generously on such an exercise? At what point ought I start phasing it and treating only occasionally for ignoring distractions?"	t5_2r067	True

1360339261.0	184wuk	Housetraining vs. Crate Training	thenumen	17	1	12	"I'll apologize in advance, assuming that questions like this have been asked a thousand times.

We have a new puppy, now 10 weeks old, and the first few weeks we had her, both crate training and house training were going really well.  This week has been not so much.  I feel like we're having a hard time reconciling to bits of training advice we've read. When you're talking about crate training, people will say that it's important not to give the dog attention for barking, whining, etc., so that they don't come to think that's an effective way to get out of the crate when they need to be there.  On the other hand, that's the only way she has to signal that she needs to go outside.  We're having a hard time distinguishing between the two this week.  Often we take her outside and it was just that she wants to play, or we think she's just wanting to get out, only to find that she has either peed or pooped in the crate.  I try to go off of a schedule based on when she ate and how likely it is that she has to go outside, but her digestion doesn't seem consistent: sometimes it's hours before she has to poop, and other times she'll poop in her crate almost immediately after eating.

She was also sleeping through the night for the first couple of weeks, but now has been waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. Last night I got up as soon as I heard her, but she had already peed in the crate.

I assume that a decent chunk of this is just part of the normal training process. but I'd also appreciate any advice on how to make it go more smoothly, especially on the issue of when to ""believe her"" about having to go outside.

EDIT: One other potentially relevant detail: I work at home alone most days, and those times usually go fairly well.  Most of the difficulty is in the evenings and mornings when my wife and daughter are home."	t5_2r067	True
1359459115.0	17hp25	Turid Rugaas - My Dog Pulls, What Do I Do? - My review	Phoolf	17	1	1	"So this little manual has been sat on my shelf for a while but recently I've had some time so thought I would catch up with some books that have been gathering dust.

My own teenager Kes has become a bit....teenagerish...recently and we needed to brush up on LLW. I usually have a heel command to help with the LLW but I'm not strict and I do let my dogs wander and sniff at their leisure when we're walking, I don't demand 100% concentration at all times.

So back to this little book - it started off seeming very simple and like the advice we've heard 100 times before that we know doesn't work all that quickly a lot of the time (stand still and change direction). I know from many people that this just doesn't work effectively. However, the further I got into the manual the more I decided I would try out her technique. Essentially instead of the old age advice of stopping and changing direction when the dog pulls you manage the situation so your dog does not ever pull on the lead, you step in before it gets to this stage. Very simple.

I set off for my evening walk with the instructions in mind, luckily I already have a mouth click attention noise that I've used since day 1 with Kes so she knows this means 'pay attention to me'. I can honestly say I don't think I've had a more pleasureable on leash road walk with her, no matter what length of the lead she had on, long, short or medium there was always slack. We walked passed some fries someone had dropped and as she went towards them I clicked and back she was by my side to receive some liver cake and carry on her walk. I let her fixate on some children running excitedly down the street and after 5 seconds clicked and we carried on without any bother. It wasn't frustrating, it wasn't hard work and it made the experience very enjoyable for both of us.


Just thought I would write that up for anyone thinking of looking into her techniques, or for those who have used them to discuss. :)"	t5_2r067	True
1359457722.0	17hoeg	Dog (sort of) kicked out of obedience class.  Just wanted a sense check on what we're doing next (lengthy)	caldridge1	18	3	17	"So, our dog trainer just called me and asked me not to bring my dog to class this week (I'll go into why, shortly).  Outside of class, he is as good as gold, but he struggles with the obedience class.    
  
First, the dog:  
He's an 8 month old GSD.  I've had him since 8 weeks and he has attended puppy classes since about 12 weeks.  Even though he has always mixed with other dogs, he's never really been that comfortable around them.  Up until he was about six months old, he would always bark at other dogs out on walks.  However, for the last two months or so, he has been much more relaxed and generally just ignores other dogs on the street (off of his lead, that is).  These days, when he sees another dog, he will generally just trot past.  Occasionally, there will be a bit of bouncing around and the odd bark, but it looks more playful than nervous.  That said, even when he properly mingles with other dogs on walks, he doesn't really interact with them or play with them.

When he's on his lead, he is still quite barky around other dogs.  Generally, it's quite rare for us to meet other dogs while on his lead because we're right by a field.  We walk about 40m and then he's off and playing fetch.

Now, the problem:
We moved to our current obedience class a couple of months ago.  Our previous class was a bit old school, and the trainers liked to shout at the dogs sometimes and snap their leads.  When I was told ""if he barks, snap his lead and shout at him"", I left.  I've done quite a bit of research and reading up on positive methods, so that class was no longer for me.

The new class is based in quite a small hall.  There are around six dogs in the class.  While in the hall, and on his lead, the dog likes to have a good bark at the other dogs when he gets bored.  We tend to all do the exercised in turns, so while the other dogs are doing their things, he likes to watch and have a good bark.  I counter this as much as possible by trying to get him to sit facing me, using the ""watch me"" command etc.  Basically, just distracting him.  This helps, but is hard to keep up for a whole hour and he still gets a good bark off now and then.  Other than being embarrassing, it has never been a serious issue.

A couple of weeks ago, a nervous border collie joined the class.  Her and my guy make an explosive combo:  He barks, she turns nervous-aggressive and goes mental.  They basically wind each other up.  No fault of either of theirs really.  He doesn't have an issue with her in particular, he just randomly barks because he's bored and that sets her off, which in turn sets him off.

The trainer called today and said that she felt that the small hall was exacerbating his behaviour, and that she was worried that he would start showing this behaviour in other settings.  She says she is hoping to start an outdoor class when it warms up a bit, and says that she thinks a larger arena will help because we can separate him from the other dogs to a distance where he's comfortable, and then slowly de-sensitise him and move him closer to the other dogs.  Apparently she has a few other dogs with similar issues, so is hoping to have a sort of ""nervous dog class"".

He has always struggled in that particular hall.  Not just with the other dogs, but he loves sniffing around the floor too.  So he'll be heeling, and then just ""sniff off"" somewhere.  He would never do that at home, in the garden, or out on a walk.  Just in that hall, which is annoying.

So, to get to the point...  I was just putting this out there to get some advice really.  I was carrying on the class because he was struggling if that makes sense?  I was hoping that taking him to class would help him with that particular issue.  I feel a bit like he's being abandoned by the trainer now, although what she has said about moving to a larger arena makes perfect sense.

Any more helpful tips on helping my guy out would be appreciated.  I think it's fairly common for a GSD to be a bit of a flake around other dogs, but I really thought we had done all the right things with him.

I am moving into a decent sized house with a fenced in backyard with two roommates that are up to the task of helping me with her. 

My family was given the dog at four months of age by a friend who had a litter. She is registered and at the moment, not fixed. 

Between my other siblings, my parents careers and their recent baby their is seldom time available for the dog and this has caused an issue with socialization. 

I have been in and out of her life these last five months as I have visited from college and I have recognized that within days of being with me she is more sociable. 

She is overly protective of my families home and a great deal of trouble to walk. I can lead her just fine, the problem comes with strangers and other dogs. I fear that there may be a trust issue as my family does not provide the necessary time commitment to be with her. She is well cared for in the sense of health and nutrition but not much otherwise.

I am approaching this subreddit in an interest to gain more information regarding:

The past week I have caught her with a vole and another small rodent. Then this morning she gifted my wife with a freshly mauled finch.

I am concerned that this could be unhealthy for her, and ideas on keeping the birds from being caught.....a large cat bell maybe?

1335740391.0	syssj	found a stray Aus Cattle Dog mix puppy and looking to keep him	StevieBoySwag	16	0	22	"last week my roommate picked up this puppy and we've debated on whether or not to keep him. No tags, and un-neutered, we put up signs near where he found him but haven't had a response yet. We thought he was a husky/lab mix but recently came to the conclusion that he was an Australian Cattle Dog mix. He's a very friendly fellow, isn't shy around people, and isn't annoying. We wanna keep him, but we are skeptical.

I sought to look up what was necessary to keep him but I am looking for more personal opinions on *how easy they are to train* and *how expensive would it be to keep this dog*. If anyone with experience could  spare some advice I would gratefully appreciate it!!

1334943376.0	sjzjv	Question about a pit bull / cane corso I might adopt	mkmcmas	17	2	33	"Hi r/dogtraining! I am currently fostering a 1yr old neutered pit bull/cane corso mix who has kennel cough. I've always had big dogs, and my family rescued troubled dalmatians when I was a kid, so I'm not in over my head. I've never been around a pit bull though. I only agreed to this dog because they needed the cage space at the shelter and I didn't have any other canines at home that could be infected. I was expecting a really miserable 10 days, because he was really pushy with me at the shelter, pulling me around the lobby, jumping all over me, knocking into me with his giant head, etc. 

When I put him in the car to take him home, he was asleep on the back seat in less than 5 minutes. He came in the front door, looked around, walked into the crate with no argument and slept hard for almost 8 hours. Since then, he's been the best dog I've ever owned. He's 100% obedient, completely housebroken, polite but shy with my cats and he is respectful but very friendly with strangers. 

Obviously, I should adopt this guy, right? I work from home and just bought a house with a fenced yard in a pit bull-friendly city. I live a couple of blocks from the lake and he enjoys the long walks. My only hesitation is the horror stories I hear about ""hidden"" triggers pit bulls have. I'm worried that something might flip a switch and cause him to become aggressive. 

Here's what I've done so far to see how he'll react:

I've played really aggressively with him and he goes out of his way to be gentle with me.

I've walked him past bikes, small kids, food vendors and other dogs. He is interested but not scared or aggressive. When he's in the yard he just sits and watches people walk by. We've had the neighbor pretend to break in. The dog didn't care. He sleeps on the bed with my cats. He lets them bite his tail and hasn't gotten angry. 

Is there anything I'm missing? I can't take him around other dogs for another week or so, but when I can socialize him, I am planning on taking it REALLY slow. Like I said, I've never worked with a pit bull before, so I don't know what I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated. 

Oh, and do they all sound like trombones when they sleep? 

Here's Gotti: http://www.imgur.com/R9FYO.jpg

*Edit: Clarification and added pic

Edit 2: I guess I should clarify what I mean by ""hidden triggers."" I know the dog doesn't have any inbred characteristics that cause specific behaviors. A dog is a dog is a dog. What I need to know, and should have asked, is are there things these dogs learn in their bad environments that I need to watch out for?  For example, a standardbred racehorse is trained to jog at a slow pace going clockwise, and race going counter clockwise. These horses aren't bred to do this but it something breed specific. I need to know how humans with bad intentions can screw these dogs up, so I can do my best to give the dog a positive environment. "	t5_2r067	True
1334019492.0	s1qxd	I feel like I've done all that I can to help my pup through her fearful aggression. Do I need to put her down? I am at my wits end, please help.	guacamole23	17	2	22	"Here goes:

My dog is a 2.5 year old female pitbull/doberman/whoknows? mix, and when I got her, she was 4 months old. She has a history of food aggression which was greatly minimized through the normal techniques, but you'd still be a fool to touch her while eating today.

Ellie has always been fearful of people since I got her, but at first she would pee when pet by strangers, and only seldom growl. As she aged, the fearful urination stopped (through socialization), but soon thereafter developed into full fledged growls and sneers.

When a guest comes to the apartment, she gets very excited, and greets everybody the same way; tail wags and jumping up (another problem we are working on). Once the excitement of the arrival has worn off, she becomes fearful again. While in this mode, she will move fairly close to people, seemingly wanting affection (though I know the warning signs of this situation). When she gets touched, she freezes like a dog statue, extends her neck, lowers her head and growls (sometimes sneering) until the touching is over. It's as if she wants to leave, but can't will her body to walk away. If a hand gets moved closer to her face, you're asking for a sneer, and sometime a snap followed by barking and retreating; back hair raised. If she's laying down, forget about even trying to touch her.

I used to crate her, but closing the door became too dangerous as she would whip around and bite at my hands.

Even when she is ""happy"" moving a hand toward her snout often causes her to sneer.

She has bit me several times, but never badly (luckily).

I have hired professional trainers, read books, talked on forums, had tests done by my Vet, and followed all the behavioral modification techniques that have been suggested, but to no avail. 

I know that dogs who show little to no aggression signs compared to my dog can bite, and I know for a fact that Ellie (my dog) can and probably will again. I'm very afraid that it's a matter of time until she really snaps and sends somebody to the hospital. 

At this point, it would seem that my options are try medication to help with the behavior modification (which from my research is very unlikely the answer), or put her down; which would be devastating obviously. It's difficult because when it's just Ellie and I, we're pals. She's incredibly obedient, she gets more exercise than Richard Simmons, she's a frisbee master, and she'll even snuggle with me. That's why I call her Jekyll and Hyde dog.

I have come to terms with the fact that I should probably put her down, but I need to know that I've tried everything reasonable first. Is she even happy living like this? Is there anything else I can do? Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

EDIT: I want to thank everybody for their kind words and advice. I'm going to hire an animal behaviorist ASAP to evaluate Ellie. It seems that everybody agrees (the whole internets over) that the quality of dog trainers/behaviorists varies immensely from person to person, and I intend to find the perfect person to help Ellie and me.

1332172611.0	r3kmc	How do I help my dog learn how to play with other dogs?	jessajuhanabi	15	1	10	"My dog, Cooper, is a ~3 year old Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix. He was maybe about 5/6 months old when we bought him. I worry this may be part of the problem (my mother bought him against my wishes) as he came from a pet store so to speak, and the rest of his litter were gone quite a while before him. Don't get me wrong, I love him to bits, I'm just worried that this background may be part of his ongoing issues.

Basically, for the first month or so we had him he was lovely and was a general puppy. However, when we took him to puppy school it was quite obvious he was dog shy and really didn't trust other people. Since the trainer wanted him to ""come out on his own"" he spent the entire course under a chair, not even coming out for treats.

We've worked on the shyness/agression, and he's much better with other dogs and most of his related problems have subsided. He can handle them sniffing/being around/etc, however he can't seem to play. Even with dogs he knows, he still can't get comfortable. He wont eat or drink when they're around, sit down, and he's basically stressed the whole time. He's not agressive anymore, just incredibly awkward and uncomfortable.

Is there a way to fix this? Is more socialization the key? Or is this normal for some dogs, and he just isn't the playful type? "	t5_2r067	True

1324006913.0	nepyi	Terrier mix trying to hunt and kill our older terrier dog? 	swishersweet	16	0	2	"We have four dogs, three of whom are terrier mixes and one is a lab/border collie mix (4 months). The terriers in question are Surprise, a 9 year old rat terrier/jack russell mix (we think) and Hobo, a fluffy white terrier mix who has to be at least 14 now. Both dogs showed up on our property many years ago and have been living together fairly peacefully for some time. Fixed, etc.

Relevant history: 

* Our older lab, the dominant/bossy dog of the group, died this spring. She and Surprise were fairly close but did fight. Surprise was upset by Lily's death though.

* Surprise was bitten by a rattlesnake about 2-3 years ago. She received treatment right away but after the bite has behaved much worse -- very neurotic, paranoid, etc.

* Surprise does hunt small rats and things -- when hunting, she switches into a different mindset and becomes very focused. Usually not an issue when she is killing pests and rodents; she is not aggressive to our chickens and ducks and goats (aside from some chasing of the chickens).

So Surprise has issues with other dogs. She used to get into what we thought were dominance fights with Lily, our lab, and would clamp on and not let go. This was bad but since Lily was 80 pounds and Surprise is 20, Lily wasn't in danger. Surprise is fine with our new puppy and plays with it and is friendly. Recently though, she attacked our older dog, Hobo. She grabbed him and was shaking him by the neck, trying to kill him -- wouldn't let go even when lifted off the ground. After that, she has been basically stalking him around the house, sneaking up on him and attacking him. Hobo is old, doesn't hear her coming, etc. Very bad situation. My mom (I am away in college, learned of this all second-hand recently) has started dosing Surprise with small doses of Benadryl, simply to get her to not hunt our other dog and try to kill him.

Surprise is technically my dog, and was very closely bonded, but I am in college many states away and gone for most of the year. While at home, she is fairly close to my mom but not super-bonded, which seems to make her misbehave. I don't know how much of this is the issue.

Really, we're not sure why this behavior has suddenly started, but it definitely can't continue. If she keeps this up she may kill the other dog or need to be rehomed, obviously both very bad options.

Edit: not sure how relevant it is, but Surprise is not aggressive towards our three cats or our other terrier, who is actually smaller than she is. "	t5_2r067	True
1319197404.0	ljtlc	XPOST from r/dogs - My wife thinks we need to put our dog down. 	madeinguam	16	2	20	"Here's the original link:  http://redd.it/ljic7. A commenter suggested I post my issue here too. 

We have two dogs: one 4 year old, 16 pound dachshund - Roscoe and one 3 year old, 60 pound husky/shiba/golden mix - Daisy.

Backstory:  My wife had Roscoe before she and I met.  After several months of dating, we adopted Daisy from a local rescue when she was only a few months old.  Ever since the first day we got Daisy, she's always been skittish and she scares pretty easily.

Aside from the occasional scare, she's been a good dog around the house.  Both dogs would play together, cuddle up with us on the couch, etc.  No real issues.  

As of about a year ago, Daisy would occasionally get aggressive and attack Roscoe.  It used to be over something obvious, like Roscoe going after her food or something, but within the last couple of months, she'll go after him over absolutely nothing.  Roscoe will be hanging out on the couch, and Daisy would come from another room and attack him.  And because she's so much bigger than him, he can't defend himself.  It's really scary.  We decided to call a behaviorist but the one we were recommended isn't available for another couple weeks.  He told us to keep Daisy on a leash in the mean time to control her aggressive outbursts.

Fast forward to tonight:  I'm at work, and my wife is in a room with Daisy by her side on the leash.  Roscoe comes into the room and Daisy immediately attacks him.  My wife put Daisy in her crate and Daisy started lunging and showing teeth to my wife!  She's never done that before.  The ""attack mode"" usually subsides and she's back to her normal self.  This was the first time she wanted to go after either of us.  

When I got back from work, we talked about what to do because now, we don't know if the behaviorist can fix such extreme behavior.  On a side note, we're going to be starting a family soon and we don't want any issues with future babies.  My wife thinks the only course of action is to put her down.  She doesn't trust Daisy with anyone else.  

I apologize for all the details, but I want you to know the history of this dog.  I love this dog.  

Here are some pics:

We're* thinking he has some heeler and possibly some Aussie blood. Anyway, we recently rescued him from an owner who showed him absolutely no affection. He's been locked in a kennel, away from people, for practically his whole life. He has some signs of being beaten.

He's got a clean bill of health from the vet, and we've done some basic aggression tests. He's passed all of our tests, but he did bite the previous owner when the owner was trying to force him out of the kennel to bring to us (that's another crazy story.) The owner admitted that it was his own fault for ""dragging him"", but it's still something to keep in mind.

Anyway, Blue is still extremely scared. Two weeks of training has done wonders, but it's still touch and go. He loves being in his kennel, but this time he gets lots of human interaction. He loves going on runs, and he loves playing with other dogs. When my friend introduced him to her dogs and let them play, it was the first time we saw his tail wag.

So, over the next two weeks, we're going to begin transitioning him from his foster house to my house. I have lots of room for him to run around (on a leash, I'm nervous he'll bolt if left to his own devices) and  we get the feeling he is going to be a great one person dog (he gets nervous when there are lots of people around.) And there's a great dog park near my house so he can get lots more interaction (pending a few more aggression tests with male dogs.)

Basically, that's my story. I'm looking for absolutely any advice from people who have worked with dogs like Blue before. He's my first dog (though I've worked with animals all my life) and I'm a little nervous. Thanks for your help!

1376518746.0	1kdo0g	5-Year-Old dog suddenly peeing inside daily.	jmc8586	15	0	13	"Hello, I looked around the subreddit, but couldn't find a post that matched my circumstances quite right.

As the title suggests, my 5-year-old Jack Russell has suddenly started peeing inside on a daily basis (sometimes 2-3 times a day). My wife and I adopted her about 3 years ago, and she was not potty trained at the time. I admit we are far from the best trainers, but we quickly got her to go outside regularly. She has never been perfect though, with regular accidents happening every 2-3 weeks. I realize the problem may have never been truly fixed.

She generally uses the same 3-4 spots around the house. We have tried the ""special enzyme"" cleaners, and the ""pee discouragers,"" but none of it seems to make a difference. My wife has even started mopping the floor every other day. There is a dog door which is kept unlocked, and a decent sized yard.

A few specifics:

- We have 2 other dogs (Both Boston Terriers, 5 &amp; 3 years old). The dogs get along splendidly for the most part.
- She has never done it in front of my wife or I. We always discover it after the fact.
- She has a condition called Addisons, for which she takes a daily medication (Prednisone). She has bi-annual blood tests, and as of the last one her kidneys are great.
- The dogs hang out in the kitchen/dining room during the day. It is roughly 100 sq/ft, has a dog door, and is blocked from the rest of the house by a gate.
- Nothing significant has changed around the house in the last six months (aside from a few new pieces of furniture)

I'd like to avoid crate training if possible, as the logistics with 3 dogs seems pretty daunting. But I am willing to go at it as a last resort if it is truly the only solution.

I have been praising/treating her when I catch her going outside, and trying to do regular ""trips"" to the back yard with her to encourage her. I have been avoiding negative reinforcement, but I admit my patience is starting to get a bit frayed.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	t5_2r067	True

1373495812.0	1i1ger	Dog barking at roommates. Need advice.	Thithyphuth	16	2	16	"Here's the scenario.

Roommates come home, dog runs up to the front door and barks at them non-stop.

Roommates come out of the bathroom, dog barks at them.

Roommates come out of their room, dog barks at them.

Roommates walk by my room, dog barks at them.


Back-story;
So my mom got Tiger at about 6months from the pound, she kept for a few months, even took him to professional dog training courses so he was potty trained, listened to sit, down, stay, and come, but at he grew her apartment complex made her give him up to me because he grew over their weight limit.  I love dogs and glady took him.  Me and my roommate, played with him all the time, I had people over regularly, and he was fine.  His only issue was he was VERY submissive and any time I tried to teach him commands and such he would get very low, ears back, lay on his back, etc, very afraid, sometimes even pee himself.  Eventually he got a little better but in general he's a very submissive dog.

After about two years that roommate moved out and i got a series of other roommates.  Tiger would bark at every one of them any time they got home.  They would all just completely ignore him.  One roommate who was here for about 3 years would come home, tiger would start barking at him, he would walk strait past him to his room and slam the door in tigers face.  I would yell at tiger (from the back of the house where my room is) to try and get him to stop but in general he wouldn't until the roomate went in his room.  I tried talking to my roomate and told him he needs to both yell no when tiger barked and *also* pet and reward tiger when he stopped or didn't bark, he never did any of this.  Very few of my roommates since the original made any attempt to play with or pet tiger.  About 2 years ago ago I had a girl roommate in the room near the front of the house, she would do the same thing, ignore him.  Then about 6months ago Tiger started barking a little more agressively at her when she would get out of the bathroom.  At this point in time my method was calling him to my room and putting him in a down-stay. Right about that time i FINALLY found a treat he would actually eat right away (before all treats he would sniff cautiously, grab, drop on the floor, sniff, lick, lick, sniff, grab, run to another part of the house, then slowly eat. Kinda hard to use as a reward when he does that) So I started giving him these treats as reward when he didn't bark at people around the house.  Sadly about 2 weeks after the agressive barking started he apparently bit her, possibly on two separate occasions when getting out of the bathroom (not really sure, she wouldn't talk to me about any of this, just yell at me, and threaten to have him put to sleep).  She moved out soon after that and another guy moved into the front room.  I made a big effort finding really dog friendly people to live in the house, people that actually want to play with and pet tiger.  So no I have two other guys, one in the room next to me, one in the front room.  I'm giving tiger treats every time he doesn't bark when they're around.  If he does bark I immediately whistle and call him to my room (or just whistle, he comes very quickly).  I tell him to sit, then down, then sit, then down, then sit, then give him a treat.  The idea is that I'm removing him from the tense situation, putting him him in a situation where he has to pay attention and listen to commands, then reward for the commands, hopefully separated enough from the barking so not to reward that, while also not trying to give him negative reinforcement for whatever he was barking at, if that makes any sense....  I've placed baggies of treats near the bathroom and front door and told my roommates to give him a treat whenever he stops barking at them or if he just doesn't bark at all.

He still barks at them but the situation has improved *dramatically*, sometimes he doesn't bark at all.

The only issue is they don't do the treat thing as much any more and he had a pretty major relapse yesterday.  The roomate next to me leaves his door open all time time when he leaves and my dog loves to go in and sleep on his bed. He was in the kitchen, my dog on his bed, he walks down the hallway towards his room and tiger runs towards him *aggressively* barking, he yells No loudly, etc, I run out immediately, clap my hands and tiger runs into my room and I put him in a down-stay.  He didn't seem to react to my roommate yelling but only when I clapped.  Side note, He also only does the barking if I'm in my room or not near him, if i'm around he's *always* super friendly and playful.  But If I leave the house he gets depressed or something and is fine around my roommates.

So i'm probably going to have another talk with my roommates about giving Tiger treats when he's not barking so they keep it up again but I'd like to know if I'm handling this right and what else I can do?

We have taught her to sit, hold, go lay down, to not jump and to wait for attention (i.e. when we get home, she has to sit and wait to get attention, she isn't allowed to get all excited and jump.) She knows where it's okay for her to lay down (her bed, the recliner, but not the couch, not the bed.) She's stopped taking food from our plates. I don't think her previous owners really trained her at all. 

Our biggest problem is with cats. We live in an apartment complex, and there are multiple stray/outdoor cats. She's gotten a lot better when we are out on a walk around the complex; sometimes she will not pay much attention, most of the time she gets excited, pulls very strongly, and yelps and freaks out, but we are able to get her to focus on us instead, and either keep walking or make her sit down and pay attention to us instead of the cat.

However, when we are inside of the apartment, many times a week one of these damn cats will either come up onto the porch, or lay directly outside right where she can see them. When this happens, she absolutely loses her shit. She's already broken off part of the window frame around the door (structurally it's fine but the point still stands.) She jumps and scratches at the window while howling and yelping.

I'm 39 weeks pregnant, and it's stressful enough when this happens, but it's really going to become an issue once the baby is here and she starts this behavior.

When this happens, we make her go lay down in her kennel and close the door so that she's alone for a while. She even goes in there expectantly, without a fight- she freaks out and goes crazy, but it's almost like she knows that when this happens she has to go lay down and be by herself. 

I would love *any* advice on what to do here. Feel free to critique any of our methods so far - we are doing the best that we can, and she's made great improvements in all other aspects of her behavior except for this. As I said, I am hugely pregnant and by myself most of the time while my boyfriend is gone at school and work, so I am doing what I can, but it's extremely stressful when this happens.

I've mostly accepted that she will probably never be friendly with cats, as long as she can keep her cool around them that will be good for me. I just really need her to stop going *insane* when she sees a cat outside."	t5_2r067	True

Now, I don't plan on having a dog registered as a service dog or anything, but I would really appreciate it if my dog learned how to make sure I got up at a reasonable time and got out of bed (this is currently my biggest problem).

In general they get on fine; occasionally they are great, sometimes they fight, but mostly they're just OK. 1 belongs to my boyfriend's mom, 2 originally belonged to her but we have decided to let me keep her when boyfriend's mom moves out. Lately people have been telling me that they shouldn't be separated because they say dogs shouldn't be alone, being pack animals. I had 2 on her own for a short while when 1 was fighting with her a lot, and she did struggle to adjust especially when we went away in the day to work (usually only from 10am to 4:30pm), but I think with time and patience and regular socializing with her doggie friends (there is a dog park right in front of our house) she will be ok.

Before this, i had Cocker Spaniel and we did shitty job ""training"" him. We haven't taught him a single thing, he didn't had any behavior problems, the only thing is that he was the pack leader, and if we let him off the lead, he would ""run"" away,  so as leader he wanted to follow him. If we tried to call him back, he wouldn't listen since he was the pack leader. Other think is he didn't knew how to behave when he was on lead, so the was pulling, and if i tried to ride bicycle with him on chain, he would go in front of the wheel. 

So with next pup i wouldn't like to teach basic things (sit, come,  fetch, lead behavior, when he is off lead to follow me). I have started fetching kikopup's videos, but to apply what she is teaching, i need first somewhere  to start and learn the basics and ways to teach the dogs what i want.

When it does happen, it seems to be when we are at home and lasts for some time 30 - 45 min.  He is great at night. I'm not sure what he is doing when we are gone. When the yelping has gone on for a bit, we will take him out when he calms down for for 10 seconds to see if he needs to go to the bathroom. It's tough to tell if the yelping is associated with the bathroom, because the potty training seems to be working. He will use the bathroom every time he goes outside after the crate, even if just a little. He has calmed down the couple times we put his cushy little mat in the crate with him, however I'm not sure I want to reinforce the yelping by doing this. He will freely go into the cage, but I sometimes wonder if this is to look for food - we feed him in the crate every other meal or so.  Maybe he just needs to grow out of this, or we need to give him longer than 30-45 minutes?  Any thoughts?  I can provide more info if needed. Thanks!

He is terrified of people. He likes dogs but he avoids people like the plague, especially men. So far he only likes myself, my aunt and my 9 year old cousin. He is not aggressive, he will just run from the person trying to interact with him. He is not food motivated in any way.

I am a dog groomer so he goes to work with me sometimes. He has many opportunities to interact with many people and my coworkers, friends and family really want to help get him out of his shell.

The second day I got her I took her to the dog park to see how she did with other dogs since she lived with three other dogs at her foster home (was there for three weeks). She has been very reactive to other dogs on leash so I was initially hesitant to take her in but some other owners persuaded me to give it a try.

Initially she was very frightened and hid near me, tail between her legs. But as we were there longer she didn't show much interest in the other dogs but was very polite. She would sniff then walk away and stay near me. After about an hour, however, we had an altercation with another dog when the other dog was near me, sniffing my treat bag and she was near me also.

After that we left and I simply assumed it was a food guarding thing, though I have not noticed any other food guarding tendencies with humans. Since that time, we've been working on getting better with other dogs from afar on leash and her fear of strangers when on walks. My boyfriend and I took her to the dog park again two days ago and were playing by ourselves for awhile in one of two pens.

After awhile, another owner asked to join us and I mentioned that it was a new dog and seemed fearful/food aggressive with other dogs. The other dog ran right over to her and they seemed to be getting along well, sniffing nicely then starting to chase each other and play in what I thought was a normal way.

When we got close to the other owners and both dogs were near us, however, they got in a small spat seemingly out of nowhere. The other owners took their dog to the other pen and I followed to get their opinion on why the dogs fought. They thought it might be jealousy and we decided to try again, this time from far away on leashes and getting progressively closer with treats and praise for my dog. 

Sure enough, she was fine until we decided to take them off leash again and the other dog got near to me. As she approached, my dog's hackles came up and she started to growl/bared her teeth. They tussled again (lots of snarling but no real bites) and we decided to call it a day.

We noticed that the dog displayed the guarding behavior to both me and my boyfriend, although to a much greater extent with me, her primary trainer. How can I teach her not to guard me against dogs and in other novel situations? Is it enough simply to treat her when she is not aggressive near other dogs or are there more exercises we can work on? I'd really like to take her on walks/jogs/to dog parks without the fear she will attack some dog for showing interest in us!

She's a ~12 year old rat terrier/chihuahua mix named Olive that I adopted 4-5 years ago from a shelter and I have never seen her truly get along with another dog.

* If she sees another dog when I take her out to pee in my apartment complex (and occasionally when I take her on a walk), she takes a very aggressive stance and growl if they come closer (the other dog is usually trying to be friendly). Ears up, hair standing on back, barking and running towards the other dog, little bit of drool, eyes all wild looking.

* If she is around other dogs while inside a house or dog park, she generally sniffs the other dog for a second and then ignores them, unless the other dog gets too friendly or sniffs her butt too much, in which case she will growl and/or attack the other dog.

* I adopted a chihuahua puppy named Cleo 2 years ago and Olive tolerates Cleo, but rarely acts like she exists or plays with her. Cleo is very submissive.

* Every few months Cleo will do something to set Olive off and Olive will attack her. She has NEVER drawn blood when she ""attacks"" Cleo and I don't think she actually bites down or tries to hurt her. 
*(Please don't tell me that it is unsafe to leave them together. That is not the point of this post and it happens rarely enough that I feel safe leaving them in the apartment where they usually sleep in two separate spots without hardly crossing paths until I get home.)*


She is very smart and active, and loving towards humans. I would love to take Olive and Cleo to dog parks, but Olive is too aggressive and Cleo is afraid of other dogs. **What should I do to make Olive a more friendly dog?** Is it even possible to make her into a friendly dog, or is she just hardwired to be a dominating bitch?

1367932543.0	1duyby	20 week cockapoo is amazing at recall until he sees another dog, then he's off.	blue_cherry	18	3	13	"Hi everyone!

I have a 20 week old cocker/poodle cross, and in nearly every way he is perfect! He is very intelligent, and learns commands very quickly, he knew 'sit' a few days after I got him (at eight weeks), he knows 'stay', 'lie down', 'paw', 'the other paw', 'roll over', 'down' and we're currently working on him playing dead when I 'shoot' him. It's all going really well! Also, after a rocky start, he's getting very good at his toilet training.

My one issue is that his recall, while PERFECT when there are no distractions, completely disappears as soon as he sees another dog or person.
When it came to being able to take him on walks, I did a bit of research to see what the deal is for letting them off the lead, and many people were saying that the earlier you do it, the better, as they will want to stay near you, and won't stray very far. However on here, I see the general consensus is to keep them on the lead until their recall is perfect.

The (few) times I let him off the lead, he sees another dog and runs like a bat out of hell after it, completely ignoring my calls. Running away from him doesn't work, as he has zero attention on me, so he doesn't notice. 

I have started to walk him in a different spot, which is generally deserted, and I let him off the lead there, to allow him to run off his energy. When we do these walks, his recall is fantastic. Every time I call him, he comes running, regardless of how far away he is.

But now, due to my previous experiences of him running off towards other dogs, I'm hesitant to 'test' his recall on a slightly busier walk.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I should proceed with this? I would love it if he didn't have the urge to tear after everything he sees, but I don't know how to go about trying to sort this out?

I picked him up last night and things were great -- he was super playful and happy and we went for a long walk with my husband to tire him out so he's sleep well. We've met a handful of times before and he's been over at my apartment with his owners before, so while I expected some stress at the fact that his owners aren't around, I didn't expect what came next.

Getting ready for the morning walk, I went to put his leash on him and he hid under the table, then when I tried to coax him out from under the table, he started growling at me (mean growl). So then I backed off a bit, sat across the room and started talking to him. In response, he started snarling at me. Then he darted for his crate across the room, and kept snarling at me. I figured he needed to calm down so I brought his blanket (from his house) and dropped it in the top of the crate. Still snarling, he now starts snapping and trying to nip me without getting out of his crate, to the point where I can't even close the lid, I'm so afraid of this 20 pound puppy. We ignored him until he calmed down, like and hour later, and I was able to put his leash on and take him out. But then he on our walk, he snapped and snarled at me when I stopped because he picked up a piece of garbage and again when we got home, for no reason, he went from play to hide under the table and snarl. I've been ignoring for while I've been typing this and he's starting to venture out from under the table. But when I was first ignoring him, he kept making low growls and little barks like he was trying to engage me in a challenge. WTF ???

So I know this puppy hasn't gotten a lot of good socialization, because he was found on the street at 1 week old (sad, but true), and consequently doesn't behave like most dogs that got to spend their first 8-10 weeks with mom and litter. I get that he thinks this apartment is new turf and he's trying to stake out his piece (he also doesn't necessarily recognize me as an authority, just an annoyance and so he thinks he's trying to compete with me). But how do I strike a balance for 3 days between helping this pupping to not feel stressed and not letting him push me around (with the end goal that he not go psycho on or injure me or anyone else before my friend's get back) ? Do I keep doing what I'm doing and wait it out or is there another way ?

Any help would be greatly appreciated !!!

1. Dogs to crazy at the door, or sounds from outside like people or a dog (the sheltie more from people/dogs outside, like neighbors walking past) I'm not exactly sure how to go about stopping this. I mean they bark non-stop for just 10 minutes, it's really, really bad. Nearly uncontrollable.

2. So the younger dog goes crazy whenever he sees a person and especially a dog, from half a block away he'll start pulling hard, he will be impossible to control. If I kneel and pull him gently back towards me, he might look to me and make a whine like he's just feverish. He just wants to play and bark.

The older one, I think maybe his senses are getting dull or something, as if someone walks up from behind (like a big black guy, especially), he gets a bit spooked and might jump up and bite their jacket or something. If he sees another dog while on leash, the hair will go up on end and he won't listen (he might know not to pull, until the dogs get close) and then he'll be a bit vicious. 

There was a particularly bad incident recently where he ran out the door (mistake!) and just started attacking some guy outside, the guy was okay but like he's not a very aggressive dog, he just seems to get startled recently. He's totally fine at the dog park (although he will get a bit vicious if a dog runs past him or tries to sniff around him a bit, he sometimes lashes out, he's just an old grump kind of thing), I take him to big parties and crowds of people just fine. It seems to be due to his age. He has no problems with dogs at the dog park, it just seems to be a leash aggression.

1366573682.0	1cte8z	Need help getting sister's dog to stop barking - shock collars don't help. Becoming an issue with neighbors. Need advice please!	MisssBadgerEnt	18	5	7	"So my sister got her dog when he was less than a year old, so she did not have him since he was a little puppy - hence, didn't give him the critical training (sitting, staying, etc), his first owners did. He's a great dog, but he has one issue: barking. He's a min-pin mix, so he's not big or threatening, but he barks lots when he sees new people or other dogs. He jumps, but not in a mean way, more like, ""Who are you, are you coming into my yard???""


We've tried lots to control the barking since she got him (he's 2 now). Anytime she lets him out and he starts barking, immediately lets him back inside. He barks inside, but again, those are shorter and we stop him immediately. She keeps him in her room during the day, so if he does bark, it's not loud unless you're outside and can hear through the windows (her room is the corner of her apartment, not sharing any walls with neighbors, just outside walls).


About a month ago, she came home to a note taped to her door saying ""Shut your fucking dog up."" Even though she was angry, she posted a nice note next to theirs that apologized and said she would do better to prevent it. The next day after work, she came home, and whoever had ripped down the original (rude) note, left hers hanging. Okay...


Well, a couple days ago she had him outside, heard him bark, so she went to grab him to bring inside since people were out there. As she goes outside, an older couple is yelling at her, telling her to ""shut up your fucking dog!"" Another lady, whose apartment is in a separate building across the way, is also yelling at her, calling her a ""fucking dumb bitch,"" etc. So as she's getting screamed at by these people, she says that all they needed to do was have an adult conversation about it, not attack her. The old lady in the couple starts yelling, ""Fuck notes! You fucking bitch, learn to control your fucking dog!"" on and on.


So now she doesn't know what to do. Cooper has an anti-bark collar, but it terrifies him and he freaks out because it's a shocker and he's little! It's too much for him. So she went and bought a collar that beeps with a high pitch, and it instantly quiets him... when it actually goes off. For some reason it just doesn't register his bark. So she just doesn't know what to do. What collars have you had that have helped smaller dogs control their excessive barking? She's thinking about getting the collar that sprays whatever stuff that smells really bad to him, but she's afraid if that doesn't work she'll have no other options but the awful shock collar. 

Pleeeease, any suggestions and tips would be extremely appreciated!! She's worried that one of the people might try and hurt him or throw things at him, etc. and wants to fix the situation ASAP. She's even thinking about moving because of this.


TL;DR: My sister's min-pin likes to bark at people he doesn't know; neighbors have suddenly become malicious towards my sister; shock collar and high-pitch noise collar haven't worked. Please help!!!

1366155589.0	1chvoa	A discussion about BAT, classical conditioning, and thresholds	skanadian	16	3	8	"I've noticed a few posts of people recommending BAT for leash aggressive or fearful dogs.  The side bar prohibits 'Recommending the use of aversives like pain, fear' but recommends Grisha Stewart's website.  Doesn't BAT involve fear? I'm going to quote my favorite trainer here to maybe get my point across;

&gt; Thought next I'd put out a quote from a Psych PHD. Because the question is ""what is threshold?"" All the techniques we've talked about you'll hear people say, ""Keep the dog under threshold.""


Classical conditioning;
&gt; They work in different ways.
Some, you keep the dog at a place they are happy. You pair the scary thing with happy things and gradually make it harder. For example. The spider is waaaay across the room in a locked box. Are you okay with that? Let's have a beer. Fun! The goal is zero stress. You say, ""How can anyone get over their fear if it's not scary enough?"" That is what makes this technique work. Tolerance builds even if you don't see it. 

BAT

&gt; Other techniques teach that the scary thing goes away. ""See this spider? You're kind of uncomfortable. If you're good, I'll let you move away. Getting to leave is your reward."" This is called negative reinforcement. People say, ""Keep the dog under threshold."" Can you?

.

&gt; Here's the Phd answer simplified.

&gt; If you aren't over threshold, why would the animal stop doing what it is doing. If you're using negative reinforcement, you have to first add something punishing. ""I have to add the stress/pain so I can reward you by making it go away.""

&gt; So, looking back at the previous discussion, how do you KNOW a dog is under threshold?

&gt; Because it doesn't WANT to go away, or doesn't want to drive the scary thing away. ""I chase you away grrr.""

&gt; Some people use a different definition. But generally speaking, if it drives the dog away, it's aversive (nasty). If moving away from something scary works, the dog is feeling stress.

&gt; Which is why the definition I use is, ""Still wants to play my training game - and maybe even wants to go closer to the scary thing.""

&gt; Easy rule to remember. Try to pick the dog's threshold. Start working double the distance away. Keeps you from being accidentally wrong.

So by suggesting BAT, you're suggesting the dog must first experience the fear.  Once an appropriate behavior is displayed, the scary things go away.

1363807253.0	1aojd7	Moving in August- boyfriend wants to get a cat. Dog is reactive, how to proceed?	silverbeat	15	1	22	"Sorry for the long post... I've had my dog, [Wallaby](http://i.imgur.com/fD7ve.jpg) for 2 years [he's ~4] and I honestly don't know what to make of his reaction to cats. Out on a walk, he used to try and chase them until I trained him better leash manners. Now if they're running he'll probably chase, but if he just sees one he whines and ""talks"" anxiously.

I work in a vet clinic where we have a house cat [Sheeba] and often have cats boarding with us. I usually keep them shut in their condos when I bring my dog in. Since I started bringing him in I have taken careful note of his reactions to the cats. First interaction went like this: He smelled them, and started whimpering and sniffing frantically at Sheeba's cage bars. She got frustrated and hissed at him. His ears and lips went back, eyes widened, and he backed off, still whining and pacing a little. He has had similar encounters with other cats, but when Sheeba's brother was boarding with us I saw something new. He again got too ""uppity"" and, feeling threatened, Sheeba's brother swatted and yowled at him. Wallaby backed off for a split second and then returned fire with a threatening growl of his own. This same thing happened yesterday when he was on leash in the clinic and Molly [a boarder, out of her condo] was upset with how closely he was interrogating her. She spat and swatted and he responded aggressively. Though still with his ears back and eyes popping out of his head. 

He has a solid 'leave it' and when he walks by the condos just whimpers a little, perhaps glancing over, except for the few times when he does get fixated--which usually only happens when the distraction level is higher: after hours when it's only me and a couple other staff in the building he never has a problem.

**So, he's scared of cats...? But, I believe, would still pose a serious threat to one if left to his own devices. If anyone has been through this before, what can I do now to make the household more peaceful after we move?** Also, is it better to have my dog stay with my mom for a few days when we get the cat so that he/she's more comfortable in the new space?

Also worth mentioning: the fur on the back of his neck [and once, all along his spine] stands on end when he sees a prey animal like a rabbit or a deer, and also things like statues/those blowup lawn ornaments.. this used to happen with cats too but I haven't noticed it recently.

He's also, to be entirely frank, pretty dumb. He will jump into the puppy's pen and sit there, allowing Farley the 4-month-old berner/lab to run over and clamp down on his neck and head and eventually start pulling and shaking him. What does Theo do when the play gets rough and painful? He cries and then rolls onto his back and exposes his belly to Farley, who then goes for that.   
Farley is still in the nipping stage, and he's still playing pretty rough, so I can't tell if he's playing just as rough with the cat as he would try to with us, or if he's actually feeling some sort of prey drive toward Theo. When Farley's out of his pen, he spends the whole time following the cat around, trying to wrestle with him, barking when he can't get to him. I end any play that looks painful and put Farley in his pen or crate, but Theo doesn't learn or ever fight back, so he's back next to Farley an hour later and submitting on the floor to more nipping and roughhousing.   
He's not ever actually HURT Theo as far as I can tell. Mostly Theo is just at all times sporting a nasty saliva-induced spiky hairdo. But Farley has been with me for two months and he's still just as excited to chase around and wrestle with Theo. He's also getting bigger. Is the novelty of a cat in the apartment going to eventually wear off, or should I be really worried that this may grow into something more dangerous? I give him time-outs when he's too rough and I treat it the same as I would when he plays rough with us (""no bite"", ""kisses only"", etc.) but ignoring Farley is the best way to get him to stop rough play, and Theo just sits there not defending himself...

Rocky has been sleeping in our bed since he was a puppy, but has recently started leaving little nuggets on the duvet, which we discover in the morning. He is not emptying his bowels completely, only a single nugget or two. We suspect it is because he believes the bed is his territory and objects to my presence. Our usual nighttime routine is, he and my wife go up to bed around 10pm and I come up later around 12-1 am. At first we thought he might be having digestive issues, but nothing has changed food wise and his movements are solid and regular (twice per day). We did an experiment recently after he had consistently done this 5 nights in a row. After the 5th incident, I decided to spend the entire night downstairs and, voila, no nugget. We repeated this a couple more times with the same result, so we're pretty sure he is doing it out of protest. The problem is, trying to get him off the bed at this stage is probably going to be very difficult. He's a very whiny dog and very persistent. Previous attempt to have him sleep in his cage resulted in a totally sleepless night for the entire household. We have also tried going back to basics by rewarding him each time he does his business outside. He is well loved and gets lots of attention.

Fennix16	15	2	21	"We adopted a one year old Border Collie mix named Astro about two weeks ago. He's usually very calm at home and at the park and loves to have other dogs chase him or be chased. However, he's also a very submissive boy and anytime another dog becomes too rambunctious he flops on his back to show his stomach. Most of the time the dogs smell him and then they continue playing but yesterday one dog would NOT leave him alone. He kept pinning my dog down and clawing at his face and ears.

I'm new to the whole dog park scene and half heatedly tried breaking them apart but I'm not sure how I should push the other dog away and if that would offend the owner? I was surprised that the owner didn't care that her dog was bullying mine and we eventually left the park because her dog was so out of control.

So, how do I get the bullying dog to leave mine alone when it becomes too aggressive and how do I do it so I don't offend the owner? Being that my dog is so calm and low-key he tends to become the target of overly aggressive dogs.

Does anyone have any ideas for ways to get my dog exercise while she's on a leash? 


I would also welcome any training advice for stopping dog aggressiveness. I have tried to look it up online but a lot of things are very contradictory or the tips are not very specific. 

She was fine with other dogs until quite recently (a few months ago). It started with smaller dogs, so I would keep her on a leash around tiny dogs and she would play with the bigger dogs fine, but now she is aggressive with most dogs. I can't get her attention when she starts playing too roughly. I have a very quiet voice by nature so I was considering trying to train her to come to me when she hears a whistle. No idea if this makes sense or not.

I really don't want her to hurt a dog, so I am hoping there is a way to get her to play nicely like she used to. I'm really distressed as she used to be so well behaved with other dogs and now she is just awful. She is not human aggressive at all by the way.

1361080068.0	18ohk6	Please help with find a solution. I don't want to lose my dog. (Long Story)	allryuken	16	1	28	"Hi guys,

Sorry for the long story here, just want to give some back history.

I've always dreamed of getting a German Shepherd, i've been waiting 10 long years to get one.

A while ago my sister really wanted me to get a dog, I told her I wasn't ready to due to my work hours, and I did not want to have a dog when I had to be at work 8 hours a day and to leave the dog on its own.   (we're both adults and we live together, no parents)

She kept insisting I get a dog, due to our difference in work hours, the dog would only be on its own 3 hours a day. 

I explained that if we got a dog, she would need to train it and walk it every day, she would do it in the afternoon/evening while I was at work, and I would train and walk it in the morning, all up, an hour of serious commitment a day, plus playing time with the dog.

I explained to her that a German Shepherd would grow up to be large one day, and she would need to have good control over the dog, I wanted to be a responsible owner with good control over our dog. 

She agreed that we would raise it together, she would commit to the daily training etc.

So we purchased a pure breed GSD from a breeder. 2 days later my alarm bells went off when she said ""I can't believe how much work it is looking after a puppy.""

The first few days she keeps wanting to wrestle with the puppy and throw him around etc. because he is ""so cute"". I keep telling her not to, not to encourage that sort of behaviour with a dog that will weigh as much as her one day. (She is quite small) I tell her that she can do it if she wants, as she is an adult, but the consequences may lead to more play biting and wrestling as he gets bigger and older.

We take him to puppy school, meet a trainer who has worked with a lot of GSDs who we get some advice from, things go well.

About 3 months in, things have been progressing well, dog has learnt to sit, down, stay etc. fairly well as can be expected for his age. I go away to the US for a 2 week holiday. Additionally she is complaining that he is constantly biting her when they play. (He doesn't really bite me.)

When I come back, she tells me that the dog has been crazy and uncontrollable while I was gone. I observe that the dog is quite hyperactive when I come home from work.  I ask her if she has been doing training with the dog.  She hasn't. 

She re-instates her share of clicker training with the dog, and his behaviour improves.

A few weeks later I notice that he is starting to be more and more hyperactive when I get home, she has stopped training him again. Saying that ""There is no point to training him because he does it when you try to train him so he isn't learning anything"". I try to insist she keep training with the dog, to look up videos of new fun things to teach him, and to continue to train him to reinforce a bond and relationship with the dog.

Alas, she seems more interested in her laptop now that he is not in the cute puppy stage anymore. She continues to walk him. (Goes around the block. ) 

So now we have reached a point where he walks perfectly for me, obeys me, we have a great relationship. The only problem is that when I get home from work at 11pm at night, he is hyperactive and underexercised, and i'm exhausted from the days work. The very reason I didn't want to get a dog in the first place. 

He's now become very aggressive on the lead with her, he has bitten a dog and barks at everyone as they go past. She is saying that she doesn't want to walk him anymore because he's too big for her to control him and he ignores her.

When I am with him he behaves perfectly.

So I now feel that i'm in a situation where I am solely responsible for a dog in a situation I never wanted. 

I figure I will just have to suck it up and take him for 2 long walks (I do about an hour walk each morning + throw balls/frisbees in the park + training and play time at home in the morning, all up 2.5 hours per day) .

I can walk him another hour when I get home. I guess the question I have is..

Is there something I can do training wise to improve his behaviour walking with OTHER people?

I wish I could be there for all his walks and do everything with him. I love this dog more then anything, but unfortunately my life just isn't structured that way right now where I can..

If it comes down to it, I will seek to re-home him to an experienced owner. I would rather he have a good life then become declared a dangerous dog in her hands and have to live his life with a muzzle and in a cage.

1360915986.0	18km6j	6 month old puppy refusing to accept 2 week old new female puppy the house.	Everlilly	14	0	24	"**[EDIT: woah I cant edit the title but to be clear, new puppy is TWO MONTHS old not 2 weeks... so bad at this typing thing].**

Hi everyone,

I have two puppies, both poodle x maltese.

The male is 6 months old, Teddy, and is an absolute joy. He was toilet trained the day we got him with very few accidents, a dream to train and picks up new ""tricks"" within just a few repetitions.. Is polite with his food (sits and ""shakes hands"" then waits to be given permission to eat) and was pretty well adapted, as far as we can tell. 

He was quite fearful when we first got him, due to being the runt of the litter, but this slowly went away and all that remains is he barks like a maniac when someone knocks on the front door, but as soon as they're inside, he's their best friend.

Cut forward to now and we have decided to get a new puppy. A girl, Harley, from the same breeder because we had such a great experience with Teddy. Teddy loves other dogs and mopes for days after his friend (my housemates girlfriends dog) goes home, so I thought it would be a relatively easy change for him.

They get along really well and they wrestle/play for a good portion of the day, and they both whine for each other when I put Harley away for naps etc.

**The problem is that Teddy does not seem to want to share ANYTHING with Harley.** 

For example if I treat them with a raw carrot or a chew toy for their teeth, or anything along those lines, he's bigger and he will ALWAYS finish first.. from that moment onward, I'm having to constantly intervene from him trying to steal hers, or him growling/barking because she is eating and he isn't. Sometimes he wont even wait until he is finished his. I gave them half of a raw carrot each this morning and he took his AND hers and barked/growled if she tried to come near them. I ended up having to crate her with her half so she could have it at all.

A similar thing happens with toys. We took away ALL his toys before she came so he couldn't get possessive of them and introduced new ones.. but any time she will be chewing on something if she is not safety crated away from him he will steal it from her and jump up onto a high surface she cant reach and just stare at her with it in his jaws.

This means she's bored and she ends up chewing on the carpet, or cables, or me and I'm having to crate her a lot more than I really want to - it isn't fair to this pup that she can't run around and have a bit of freedom.

I understand that this is something similar to ""Only Child Syndrome"" and Teddy is trying to adjust, but we give them equal amounts of attention and I take Teddy on walks and give him LOTS of 1 on 1 attention so I dont understand why he's feeling so threatened/being such a jerk.

What concerns me is that Harley is a gorgeous little girl but she's rapidly devolving (as puppies do) based on the treatment she's receiving from Teddy.

What can I do to help Teddy get past this? Has anyone else ever gone through this before?

Halp!

Walking two dogs WASN'T working. I was teaching them both bad behavior.

1360091360.0	17y4ii	Help with gaining focus	iamgreyris	15	1	6	"I'm looking for any advice in helping me to gain and *maintain* focus from my dog. I have a suggestion from the trainer at obedience classes, but looking for other suggestions as well. 

Situation:

I have a 1.5 year old golden retriever. Super smart, picks up most training quickly. He is *extremely* food motivated, which is a double edged sword.

I have issues keeping his focus if I don't have a smelly treat for him. In an isolated setting it is no issue, but when there are distractions (class is always a good example, as there are varying levels of dogs around) sometimes he is good sometimes not. I can have him heel off leash and weave between other dogs if I have some good treats in my hand, held around my sternum... in that case once he gets a whiff he will look at my hand (and thus generally at my face) and stay with me whichever direction I turn. It's fantastic. I feel great. He looks like a champ. Then I try it treatless and it is hit or miss... sometimes good sometimes not (never great), I have to work really hard at getting him keep looking at me (i.e. 'watch me'). Usually he'll glance at me, fall in line, but then start scanning the floor or the room as we move forward.

As a general rule I have been variable in when I give him treats to try and wean him off of food rewards for properly following commands, but sometimes there is something else around that is just too enticing. Hell, if someone drops a piece of cheese there is almost nothing I can do to get his attention unless I very sternly bark out a command before his brain tunes all of reality out (cheese is something he goes psychotic over for some reason, which was great for working on recall but sucks for anything else).

A suggestion from our trainer is to help get him acclimated to looking at my face rather than my hand but giving treats by mouth (haha not what you think). I did this to help reinforce 'watch me' early on, I'd either put a treat between my lips or put a few pieces of chopped carrot in my mouth and spit a treat towards him when he looked at me. Yes it sounds gross, but it works. The philosophy behind it is that when gets rewards from the hand, he focuses on the hand (which is true just from watching where his eyes are focused). My worry is that while this helps get him looking at my face rather than my hand, isn't necessarily helping with the core focus problem.

So.... after all that rambling, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts/ideas/advice? Some of this is time and repetition of course, he is still young and repetition and new situations are key to helping to lock in behaviors. But getting his focus is key to anything, and I'm close to the end of my wits trying to get and maintain his focus without relying so heavily on food."	t5_2r067	True

The dog started licking my jacket which I was okay with, but then it started biting my treat bag which I had clipped to my belt.

1359662221.0	17nbaq	Crate training - Howls, barks and whines only when I leave.	Spare3Parts	14	2	9	"So, I have a 6 month old mutt puppy that we've had for almost a month.  I've been crate training her and she's over her fear of her crate, she'll go in willingly when I command and won't whine at night or when she's in there during the day when I'm around.  She'll go in and sleep on her own too.
My problem now is when I leave the apartment, she barks/whines/howls for between 15 and 30 minutes.  I set up a recorder to see how long and if it was ever getting better, but it hasn't.  
Looking up ways to fix it doesn't seem to be working for us.  We have a gate that keeps her in the living room and when I'm in the kitchen/bedroom/bathroom she's fine, so she's ok with being left alone for short periods but if I leave she barks and howls more than she ever does.

What I've done so far is do my leaving routine (keys, jacket, shoes) and don't go anywhere so she gets bored with it.  I've also taken her for long walks or to the dog park right before to wear her out.  I don't make a big deal when I leave or when I get home, and usually I put her in the crate about 15 minutes before I leave and don't let her out till she's calm.  I also always make sure she goes outside to do her business before crating her.
I've put her in her crate and have gone out the door and back in several times.  
Is there anything else I should try? If I leave the house for a few minutes and come back in, should I do that when she's whining or wait till she stops?
I need help real quick, this has to stop because I live in an apartment and worry about our neighbors.

TL;DR:  Dog isn't afraid of crate, doesn't mind be alone for short periods but goes nuts when I leave the apartment.

Edit:  Also, I have put toys in there for her to entertain herself with, but she'll completely ignore them till I let her out.  Then she'll grab them, sit somewhere else and chew on them."	t5_2r067	True

He is very receptive to training, friendly, happy little guy. He's learning crate training (ok with it at night but hates it in the day) he's also just started going to the loo outside and seems to be doing well. (As I wrote that he farted and then weed on the floor...)

1358229620.0	16lr5l	My First Dog Training Class Experience - Not What I Expected	TheDogRapport	15	1	18	"I am visiting dog training classes around the city to get more information about dog training and hopefully be a dog trainer in the future. I am hoping to find a good trainer who I can apprentice under. This first trainer is definitely not a fit. Here are some things I thought were off, let me know what you think. 

*The ""class' was held in a pet store. Not in another room or secluded area of the pet store, but actually in the aisles of the store! She said it's perfect because it teaches them to avoid the distractions. Maybe true, but the dogs were all untrained and heavily distracted by the food, treats, and toys in the store. Doesn't really set them up to succeed.

• ALL the dogs were on martingale collars or ""humane choke collars"". Although not entirely choke collars, the dogs sounded like they were choking when they pulled away from the owner.

• The owners were taught to push on the rear end of the dog to make them sit. I don't think this teaches the dog to actually want to sit and therefore sit on command in the future.

•This was week 2 of her course and she was teaching the dogs to heel. They walked up and down the aisles. She told the dog owners to do a slight tug when the dog started to get ahead. Since most of the dogs were all untrained and heavily distracted, the owners were pulling on their dogs causing them to choke (one Collie was pretty good though). One owner actually said that her arm was starting to hurt because the dog kept pulling. She had a significantly rowdy Lab.

I left halfway through the course out of frustration. Although she wasn't mean (she was actually a sweet old lady) or doing straight-up dominance training, I found many of her methods totally incorrect. Thankfully, I was just sitting-in and did not actually pay for her class. I feel sorry for those paying customers and their dogs.

What do you think? Am I being too much? Would you mind if you brought your dog to a trainer who did the above?

1355782770.0	150lst	Just took over a unsocialized 7 month old GSD. 	purson	20	5	16	"So about 5 months ago a family member got a GSD puppy. After they got the puppy they did some basic sit,stay,come,down training with the pup. But nothing other then that. 

I went to visit over the weekend and seen that the dog is not socialized at all and was just left in the backyard most of the time. It also seemed like they no longer wanted the pup so I talked them into selling me the pup for just what they paid. 

Now I have another dog that I started to socialize once I got him and never had a problem. Now the problem I am having with this pup is when i try to walk him he barks at everyone and everything he see's. 

I called one of the only places i could find in town for pet-training(pet-co) and took him in. When I got him there they told me he was to misbehaved to be there, that i need to work on it and then i could bring him back. The one trainer in this town is $100 for a hour or 1000 a month.

So my real question is that i live close to a school and kids and parents are walking by every morning and afternoon. Could i just sit at outside my front door with a leash on him of course and slowly over the course of a few weeks more closer to the sidewalk? I was recommended that by a friend who said it worked for his dog and it worked. I have also been having friends with dogs come by and start on opposite ends of the yard and slowly moving closer but he just goes nuts. 

I love this pup ""shadow"" and will not be getting rid of him, I knew what i  was getting into to but wanted to save him the fate I feared would come if I left him with them. Im willing to put in all the time I need to just need to know the best method. "	t5_2r067	True
1355465083.0	14tx4h	I am worried my mum is going to give up her dog	atheista	18	4	10	"This time last year my mum decided that she wanted to get a second dog (she already had a maltese cross).  She was in the process of buying a new house on five acres of farm/bushland so she couldn't take one immediately, but my partner and I had been thinking of getting a dog so we offered to foster one for a few months until she'd settled in with the move.  

So mum, her partner and I all went to the dogs home and fell instantly in love with a five month old beagle/staffy cross.  She was absolutely adorable and by christmas eve she was home with me and my boyfriend.  We toilet trained her, taught her not to bite, not to chew things she shouldn't (okay...she *kinda* got that one), basic commands (sit, stay, lay down, shake).  She was a strong dog (that staffy muscle!) and could be quite tough to walk, and she got crazy excited whenever someone would turn up to the house.  But overall, in the couple of months that we had her, we managed to turn her into a moderately well behaved and incredibly friendly dog.

Then she went to live with mum...

The first problem was that they just didn't think about fences.  They refused to do any more than patch jobs on the fences, and of course she kept getting out.  In the end they bought a second hand invisible fence with a shock collar.  I wasn't happy with this, but it worked...for a while.  Quite often they'd just let her out into the farm/bush to run around.  She'd disappear for hours which is so dangerous when there are other farms around - she could be injured, shot... Well, over the year she went from a sweet dog that wouldn't hurt a fly to hunting down wallabies and killing them.  Then mum complains when she caught the dog going for their new lamb.  Don't they realise that they let her develop that behaviour!?  

Now that it's summer mum's worried about snakes so the dog can't go for her runs any more.  But she's used to them now.  She's used to exploring and chasing animals and burning up all of that energy.  Now that she's confined to the yard again she's started destroying things because she has so much pent up energy and is probably really bored.

I suggested taking her to doggy day care once a week but she said it's too expensive.  So I suggested they take her to the bushland fully fenced dog park on weekends but she said she already does enough driving (it's probably about 25 minutes from their house).

Mum seems at the end of her tether but unwilling to put in the effort that is needed.  Which infuriates me!  I hate it when people get a dog but don't commit to doing what is needed to keep the dog happy and well trained.

I'm so worried that they're going to give her up.  I love this dog, but we have a beagle now and we rent so we really can't have two dogs.

I offered to have the dog around for play dates once a week, hoping that they'll play together and burn off a lot of energy.  This week they played for 45 minutes then slept the rest of the day, so I'm not sure if it will have the right effect!  But my mum's dog was really well behaved...after the initial crazy excitement she was calm, did everything I told her to do, and she seemed so content snuggled up next to me all day as I did my work (which makes me think that maybe a lot of the problem is separation anxiety).

Sorry this is so long!  Basically, what I'm trying to work out is...is there anything I can do with the dog on the days that I have her that might improve her behaviour all round?  Perhaps any way that I could work on calming her excitement when she greets people?  I really want to keep this dog in the family and I'm prepared to put the work in, even if my mum isn't.

Here's a photo of her sitting very obediently :o) http://imgur.com/D3LwM

We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into by doing this however. Some big, embarrassing problems with this dog that need correcting:

* Not potty-trained at all. I'll bring him out, he's walk around and maybe pee a bit, but not even an hour later there's a puddle in the house.
* Barks waaaay too much. He barks at any sign outside, he barks at visitors, sometimes he just barks seemingly at random.
* Can be too aggressive... He barks at other dogs, visitors. He bit another dog, I wouldn't be surprised if this eventually carries on to other humans, which could lead to big trouble. This is a big problem.

Earlier this year, a 4 month old collarless pitbull/boxer showed up at our home and, after not finding the owner, she gradually became our dog. I explain because I would not have chosen this type of dog to go with my other one, but because looking for a new home for her got a lot of responses from obvious dog fighters, and because she's so sweet and good-natured we decided to keep her. I would have found her a new home if I thought she was plain aggressive, but she's really not, not even with food. She's now 8-9 months old

The dog has anxiety issues but the main thing that concerns me is she follows our cats and the smaller dog a lot. She's very curious but sometimes looks like she's hunting. She's very, very good meeting other dogs on walks, always submitting or backing up when the others show they've had enough of her energy. She gets along great with many other dogs. Nothing bad has happened other than the puppy getting some scratches from the cats, but she actually gives them their space when they're ticked and is somewhat afraid of one of them. She still follows them  at close distance pretty relentlessly when not otherwise occupied. 

The chi does not like large dogs and has not warmed up to the new one. She growls and snaps at her from higher positions but on the floor the chi runs under tables or beds to get away. I've read that letting two dogs work it out is often the best approach, but the little one is quick to snap and I'm worried about the bigger one retaliating. When the cats smack at the puppy getting too close, she has been responding more playfully, pouncing and wagging, and this also scares me as she could easily step on the little one. So far I've tried telling the big one to get back and pushing her away when she's too close, but I'm usually carrying the little one since this does little to deter her.

I want the little one to be able to walk freely around the house, as it was hers first. I've taken the pup to the most respected and recommended trainer around me, who turned out to be a horrible prong-collar peddler who wanted me to march her around to show her I'm boss :/. So I'm asking you, and I'd especially like to hear from real trainers or those with similar situations, how do I get the puppy to leave the older dog alone, and should I simply let them walk around together with their size difference (they're always supervised when together btw)?

Orchid_Bri	18	4	11	"My eight year old Rottweiler/Australian shepherd mix Roxie is my best friend. She is a very sweet and loving dog, and I've had her since she was 8 weeks old so our bond is very close. She has always been extremely protective of me and this has sometimes been a problem, only to the extent of her barking aggressively when someone comes to the door. She is well trained and very obedient, but when she is convinced there is a threat to protect us from nothing I do or say can calm her down. 
I just had my first baby 6 days ago. Roxie could tell something was up since I became pregnant, and especially in the last few weeks seemed anxious with all the changes. People constany in and out of the house helping out, nursery being set up, and when I had early signs of labor she was very concerned about me and wouldn't leave my side. Then I'm gone in the hospital for 4 days while she stayed with my parents and come home with a baby. It's a lot for a dog to take in, I know. She has done amazingly well with the baby, she is so calm and gentle around him and wants to be near us all the time. She sleeps next to his crib like she is guarding him. Her protective and anxious nature however, has kicked into overdrive. Every little sound she hears outside gets her most ferocious guard dog bark, and any visitors are getting greeted by her growling and barking. We have had a lot of visitors since everyone wants to see the baby. We have been dealing with the behavior by putting her in her kennel until she is calm and quiet and then letting her out to greet guests. 
Yesterday though, things went horribly awry. I had some complications with birth and had to have a nurse come out to the house to help me with some after care for my recovery. (I am in pretty rough shape right now recovering from a c section among other issues.) When the nurse pulled up Roxie of course went berserk, so I put her in her kennel. Because I have stitches and can't bend too well, I guess I didn't latch the kennel properly, and she got out and came charging at the poor nurse right as I opened the door, barking and growling. I apologize and Roxie sniffed her and calmed down. Roxie sat quietly and nicely next to the nurse and I the whole time she was there, almost 2 hours. But the minute the nurse stood up to leave, Roxie lunged at her with no warning and bit her leg hard. She didn't break the skin but left a bruise and bite marks. This poor woman was nice about it but obviously upset. She immediately called her office to file an incident report. I'm terrified she is going to turn around and sue us.

Kyene	16	0	15	"So my pup is about 6 months and we are still working on heel and not stopping to sniff everything on walks. This morning he picked up a stick (as he loves to do), but I let him carry it and he behaved extremely well with the stick in his mouth! He heeled almost the whole time he had the stick and did not stop to sniff anything. 

Eventually he dropped it and I gave him another and he continued to be behave. About halfway though he was getting tired and was panting a lot so would not hold sticks anymore. But he also started acting up!

So, have any of you seen something similar? Or a suggestion to continue this behavior? I praised the hell outta him while he was behaving.

Also I read that dog love wearing backpacks and have been wanting to get one for him. Do you think it would have similar results?

1340218797.0	vcbcn	Need some help with dog temper tantrums	pocketfrog77	16	4	21	"I have a 1 year old black lab who is 95% pure awesome, except for one major problem.  She completeley breaks down on walks when she sees rabbits or other dogs.  

With rabbits, she longs to go belting right after them, and when I hold her back, she becomes very difficult to control.  Suddenly, there is a lot of whining and yelping.  She lunges forward against the easy-walk harness until she ends up standing straight up on her hind legs.  In moments like this, she has zero focus, so I can't get her to sit or take treats, or even look at me.  Mostly, I end up u-turning it, but even then, she remains super amped up, pulling on the leash and scanning every single yard for any more rabbits.  One glimpse of a fluffy white tail, and she'll start the whole display all over again.

With dogs, it's a similar story.  My pup is great with dogs off leash.  She's fine in day-camp, at dog park, and at dog beach. Never been in a fight, never had to have a time out.  When she sees another dog on a walk, all she wants to do is run up to it and say hi, but of course, you can't always do that.  (I'm looking at you, paranoid neighbor lady with the min-pin).  If I hold her back, she'll start whining, yelping, and leaping up into the air like a cracked-out ballerina.

I'm trying to get her to sit and take treats while that other dog is in view, but it is VERY difficult to get her focus.  Even with her favorite, high-value treats.  I had some small success yesterday, when she sat briefly enough to take a cheese cube before launching herself back into tantrum mode.

We are supposed to start a beginner class at pet smart in one week, and I'm really uncertain as to what's going to happen.  I know if I try and keep my dog from playing with or smelling the other dogs in class, she is going to throw a spectacular tantrum, and I'll look like the jerk who brought the super agressive dog.  

I'm planning to tire her out at day care that day, and I'm hoping once she's gotten the chance to smell everyone, she'll be fine in class, but I just don't know.  It could all go terribly, horribly wrong.

Any help, either with the impending dog class or with these issues long-term?"	t5_2r067	True

I have two 3 month old pomchi puppies. I'm in the process of teaching them everything, and of course because i have two litter mates it's double the effort.  I'm also teaching them (boys) ""leave it"" and ""drop it"" One gets drop it, the other doesnt.

The one that doesn't get it got a hold of my Nintendo DS charger and chewed the plug (not the socket part but the part that goes into the DS) off of the wire.  I didn't want him chewing it because the bare wires were showing now and it was still plugged in and i also didn't want him chewing on plastic he could swallow so i gave the command drop it tempted him with some delicious treats but he was content on keeping the charger with him.  

because of the exposed wire part i decided to grab it out of his reach (90% of the time he doesnt growl or care)

this time he did.  he snapped and tried to bit me. got me in the hand but it didn't hurt because hes so small.

after i got it away i felt around the blanket he was sittin on to see if i missed any pieces and he tried two more times to bite and snap at my hand.

It was aggression.

What do you recommend I do if the drop it or leave it or tempting with treats thing doesn't work (or they haven't learned it yet) 

or if hes chewing something dangerous or valuable to me that i accidentally drop and tries to bite me violently... how do i discipline him after this.  

sure i can try to avoid it, but what happens when it DOES happen.

yes i AM n the process of teaching them the commands but i need to know what to do RIGHT after he bites me not how to avoid it .

1375654627.0	1jpbt3	How do you diffuse/deal with an upset dog on a walk?	blue_lens	19	6	5	"Sometimes my dog Jasper totally loses the plot on walks when he sees another dog.

I think some background is important. We adopted a pair of rescue dogs as a bonded pair, estimated at 12-18 months old. They were abandoned and the older male Jasper is very protective of the younger girl Macy. They are learning to be fantastic dogs at home. They will sit and stay before they get anything at home, I can open doors and they don't rush thru, don't bark when my neighbours stick their head over the fence, etc.

But when we go on walks and either see another dog on the road, or if we walk past a fence and a dog starts barking at him, his protective instincts kick into overdrive and he would throw himself full body at the situation. Now with a Halti collar, he still gets very upset, squirmy, focused on them, and barking, but I can usually ""Let's go"" multiple times and drag him past the situation. I don't think he is interested in playing and he definitely is not focused in me. I tend to encourage/drag him past it but to be honest he isn't listening to me and I'm just dragging him.

I feel like once I've lost him to the situation (as much as I try not to, sometimes a dog walker comes around the corner at short range), I struggle to get him back and I'm in massive damage control with no plan other than to drag him through it and reward him when he calms down. Edit: I should add, he gets treats when we are just walking normally or when he ignores a distant dog, not just after a close range episode with another dog.

My question is: How can I get him back into the zone when he has lost the plot and not responding to me, where he is getting rewarded for loose lead walking and minor distractions? Am I supposed to stay where the other dog is until he calms down and sits and then reward him, or do I need to drag him past it like I am doing to show that we should be walking still?

I should add that we start doggy training last week. At first it was an epic disaster, he would not calm down. Eventually though with lots of high value treats when he was calm, he was sitting down in a field with 40 other dogs, but the dog trainer said he was still very stressed and we had to leave half an hour into the class. I just struggle to get him from 'lost it' to able to focus on me again. We'll just have to keep up the exposure to other dogs at doggy training.

If anyone has any tips, I could really use some advice as it's starting to fray my nerves going for walks, even though he has shown some progress. It's the uncontrolled variables that turn a nice walk into a semi-traumatic experience even though I do my best at remaining calm at the time.

When he first got him, he was doing the usual thing puppies do: pooping anywhere and everywhere. For a few days last week, we actually had him going to the door, and using the bathroom in front of the door (which is a step forward!). We bought him a bigger cage for nighttime next to the same door that we've been training him to go to. Ever since we've done this, he refuses to go potty outside or even next to the door. We will go out with him for 30 minutes at a time, and he used to go, but, now he just stands around like a doofus and whines to go back inside. As soon as he goes back inside, he starts sniffing. within 10 minutes later we find a steamer on the carpet in the living room or bathroom, or a puddle in a random room of the house. We've been told he's a shy dog, but I really don't believe that to be the case. He's afraid to be alone, and when we do leave him outside by himself, he cries and squeals for however long he is out there until we let him in. He then proceeds to use the bathroom. Inside. On my floor. :(

He's a German Shepard/Collie mix. I know these two dogs are incredibly smart, and believe me he is really smart. 14 weeks old and he knows how to fetch, knows what it means when we tell him to go to his cage, and knows his name (sort of)... I just don't understand why he isn't getting this. Before you guys say ""you must have been using a different door!"" or ""You must have been breaking the routine somehow!"". Well, these last 2 days I've kept him in the cage right next to the door. As soon as he comes out, I ask him if he needs to go potty and take him out the door straight to the backyard. No difference. We really are lost about this.

So what I need from you guys is some help. Advice, tips, personal stories and homemade strategies to help me out here. Please and thank you. :)

UPDATE: Hey guys, thank you all for the tips. I've been taking him for walks daily now, and he's been much better about going in the house. Or well... He was. This morning when I got off work (I work 11pm to 7am), I went to take him out and saw he already went in his cage. Dogs aren't supposed to go where they sleep, right? My girlfriend also said he went in our computer room last night as well. Right now I'm so frustrated. Once again he was doing well, and out of no where he back to his old habits.

In the last year, we've gotten to know each other pretty well and her behavior has come along beautifully.  However, we still have some not-so-great behaviors that I'd like to work on with her, now that I'm finally allowed to ""train"" her.

1.  We've worked on leash walking and she's pretty good... except when she either sees a squirrel or right when we're leaving the house, her excitement level is really up so she pulls more than is desired.  She tries to ""hunt"" the squirrels, but if I can re-direct her attention she walks with me just fine.

2.  She jumps up when she's excited to see someone, i haven't figured out how to curb this, she just wants kisses, but it can scare people who don't know her well.

3.  She barks when someone knocks on the door, uncontrollably until the person either leaves or she figures out that she knows them already.

4.  Give! How hard is it to get a dog to drop/give on command???  FOR REAL???

ok, so those are my issues, does anyone have any books or training methods they could recommend?  I'm not trying avoid a behaviorist, but I'd like to take smaller steps first, she's very smart, I'm afraid I mostly don't know what I'm doing.  So I think if I could start with training myself, this should be helpful.  I have a Gentle Leader, that I need to buckle down and watch the ""How-To"" dvd for and actually try to use, but I think anything dealing with instinct control and/or control/modification of the breed traits (jaw strength, gameness with small animals).  I don't want people to think I can't control my animal and i want to be able to do just that, and be a responsible owner.  All advice and help is appreciated!  thanks!

1374588672.0	1ivuwj	Why does my dog run away?	doghitler	18	4	18	"Hey, don't worry, he's always on a leash and I'm training him a recall command! I'm just confused by this behavior, so I thought maybe I could get some insight into it, which would help with training.

Background: Without going into boring details, my dog (2.5 yrs old. Some kind of terrier mix, 40lbs) has been with us for a year. He had a very strong recall until about six months ago. Then, randomly and I don't understand why, the house just disregarded all logic and became like a textbook for bad dog training (Repeating, using it at the wrong times, etc). I had to scrap the now worthless ""Come"" command and I'm transitioning to a whistle (An actual plastic whistle, something only I will have. This isn't ideal at all, but it's necessary). It's difficult but we're making progress. He is on his leash 100% of the time he's outdoors. So we have the safety basics down, I think.

I still really want to understand why this dog seems so intent on running off. What *is* that behavior? A few times he's just started to bolt off in a random direction (Stopped by the leash), seemingly after nothing. Once, when his recall was stronger, he was off leash when he just started to sniff, sniff, sniff, and wandered very far away before I was able to collect him again (That was the *last* time he was off leash in an unenclosed area). At that point, he was out of sight and didn't seem to have any intentions of coming back.

When he's in the house, he's pretty velcro. He likes to keep me in sight, follows me around the house, lays outside of closed doors... So why does my little love bug always want to run/wander away!?

I feel like if I understood, I'd be better equipped to fix the behavior.

**Edit**: I should say that he gets lots of exercise. Walks everyday, hikes, swims, runs, etc. "	t5_2r067	True
1373909417.0	1icnvy	Scared and upset and in need of advice. I think we are at a crossroads with our dog, Keith.	Duckhunt	14	1	23	"My girlfriend and I are worried about our dog, Keith. He is fear-aggressive in certain situations and it seems to be getting worse. We are trying to figure out what our options are going forward.
Keith is an 11 mo. old lab/collie mix (we think). We got him, very sick, from a shelter at around 8-10 weeks. He was underweight and lethargic. We got him back in good health and had a happy puppy.

I'll just take a second to run through Keith's issues: Keith has always been a ravenous eater. I guess he starved at some point before we got him. He developed a fear of people coming around him while he eats at around 5-6 mo. He is never aggressive towards people, he just gets uncomfortable (growls, postures, barks) if he feels he gets into a situation that is threatening. We aren't too worried about this and try to work on teaching him to be comfortable (if a dog gets near his stuff he gets pissed).

Next, Keith shows aggression when people approach his room. He freaks out. This past weekend, a friend was in town, and reached into his area before I had a chance to warn him and the dog. This scared Keith and he bit him. It is the first time he has bit someone and it is very upsetting. But, i know why he bit him. He was scared and defended himself, in his eyes.

Then yesterday the worst part, in my opinion, happened. After a full day of playing in the river, Keith was snuggled up on the couch with my girlfriend and I. As she is petting him, he snarls and shows his teeth. We get him off the couch and I go to approach him, he is clearly uncomfortable and growls and snaps at me. Later that night and in to today he has been very bi-polar between normal Keith and scared Keith.

Now i'm worried, I can understand him being aggressive if it is a situation he is uncomfortable in. That is predictable. Now it seems to have transitioned into an ""out of the blue"" thing. Frankly, we can't have that. We are often around friends, children, and other dogs.

These are the problems, what should we do? What is reasonable and responsible? We love Keith, he is a family member but at this point he has snapped our trust. We would like to keep him and fix him, if we can. I'll be honest in saying that i'm hesitant to commit years to nurturing him to a level of normalcy when it seems he could go off on us, other dogs, or strangers.

Also, I want to be clear that Keith isn't all evil. 95% of the time he is a loving, friendly, and good dog.

**NEW TO REACTIVITY?**

If you are new to the subject of reactivity, it means a dog that displays *inappropriate responses* (most commonly barking and lunging) to dogs, people, or other triggers. The most common form is *leash reactivity*, where the dog is only reactive while on a leash. Some dogs are more fearful or anxious and display reactive behavior in new circumstances or with unfamiliar people or dogs whether on or off leash.

**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!

1372860968.0	1hkfw6	Quick drop-it question	coldwarrookie	13	1	11	"Just a quick question about drop-it.  I've been working with my 5-month old puppy on drop-it for 1-2 weeks now.  I give him a toy, say drop-it, click when he drops, give him a treat, take the toy away, and then give it back after a few seconds.  

He seems to be getting this quite well most of the time, but occasionally has a problem with the ""take the toy away"" step, depending on the object or his mood.

Simple Dog Crack

1 large can of salmon, remove large bones

1/2 jar creamy peanut butter

1 egg

some flour (no more than 1c)

some water (no more than 1c)


Preheat oven to 350F. Combine first three ingredients. Add enough flour and water to make a thick brownie batter-ish consistency. Spread onto very well-greased cookie sheet with lips. You want it spread pretty thin, so bake half of it if you have to. Cook for fifteenish minutes, or until a bit crunchy on the edges (these treats are actually soft). Let cool and cut with pizza roller. Portion into bags. Lasts a while in the freezer, a week in the fridge. 


You won't enjoy the smell, but the dogs sure will.

She had a bad reaction to the pain medication she was taking, which caused her to lose her appetite almost completely for four days. She's off that medicine now, but during the time she was taking it, we started mixing good-quality turkey slices into her kibble to entice her to eat. (My fiance and I were desperate to get something in her stomach.)

It's been three weeks since the surgery and she is eating better now, but she almost completely refuses her normal dry dog food unless it has the sliced turkey mixed in. She used to gobble the dry food up without any problems. 

It's *very* important that she get good nutrition in order to heal properly, but we don't want to set a precedent where she won't eat kibble unless human food is mixed in. 

This morning, she ate about half of her kibble and all of the turkey in the bowl, but refuses to eat the rest of the kibble. This has been going on for a few days. 

How can we get her to eat her regular food again? At this point post-surgery, letting her starve unless she eats what we give her is not an option. But we don't want to set up a lifetime pattern of picky eating — and frankly, that turkey is for us. We want it to be ONLY a treat for her. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: Our dog lost her appetite after having surgery, so we started mixing turkey breast into her kibble to make it tastier. Now her appetite has returned, but she won't eat any kibble that isn't laced with the turkey. How do we avoid starting a pattern of having to feed her human food?"	t5_2r067	True

He's a great puppy and a super quick learner. The only real ongoing problem he's had is that when he seems someone who excites him (especially when they come over to my apartment), he gets excited beyond control and jumps up on them for attention.

I've taught my friends/family to turn away from him and ignore him when he exhibits this behavior, but it hasn't seemed to really discourage him. I've also tried throwing treats on the ground to distract him. I even tried tethering his leash to a doorknob to keep him from jumping. However, even if he's tethered for 15 minutes or something, he doesn't actually calm down until he gets all of the jumping out of his system.

What do you guys recommend for getting my little guy to calm down? Thanks!

What to do until training takes hold?	toolate4chickenfries	13	0	23	"**TLDR** - Newbie dog parent is getting dragged around mercilessly on walks.  Things are getting dangerous and frustrating.  What to do until training takes greater effect?

------------------

Fellow pup-o-philes: As referenced in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/1fd4bw/a_few_questions_on_athome_clicker_training_from_a/), my family adopted a shelter dog last weekend.  We have just begun working on clicker training, and she has responded reasonably well to the very basics. 

Going for walks, which, for the first few days we had her home, were my favorite times of day, have become laborious, tiring, and somewhat dangerous.  Gertrude is a 2 year-old Lab/pit/(something shepherd) mix, and weighs ~80 pounds.  She's strong and her prey instinct is *through the roof.*  I'm a decently in-shape guy (32, 5'9"", 160lbs, athlete, cyclist), but by the time we are home from a walk I feel like I've just been to the gym for a weight-lifting session.  She **constantly** pulls, at the slightest prevocation, and if god forbid there's a bunny visible it's all I can do not to fall over as she drags me toward them.  

I've tried offering her treats, using a clicker (to which she has only just been introduced), whistling, offering her tug rope, calling her name, clapping, snapping... nothing works.  I know you're not supposed to *yank* the leash, but when she bolts after a squirrel on the other side of the street it's sometimes the only option I have to prevent running headlong into oncoming traffic.  

The first few days of walks were fantastic: relaxing, bonding, and fun.  Over the past two days - as she's become more comfortable with her new home and family - they've become nightmares.  I know training will eventually help stem this behavior, but what do I do *until* then?  I can't stop taking her out for walks, I sometimes **have** to take my small son with me (while my wife's at work)... help?"	t5_2r067	True

So it's been another week and he's doing much better!  He's still really nervous around our neighbor but he's stopped barking and she even got an ear perk/tail wag when she gave him some turkey the other day.  He's still pretty insecure but I can definitely see some improvement.  

He's still not really into treats or play as a reward but he'll take lunchmeat turkey most of the time.  I've discovered that he also really responds to the cues from other dogs.  He met my friend's corgi last weekend and they immediately were total bros.  We took them to a fenced in dog park and when my guy saw his bro totally relaxed and comfortable in the car, his car nerves went away and have not come back.  He also seems more confident after going to the dog parks so I try to take him as often as I can.  We're moving to a neighborhood with a great park right there in a few months so soon he'll be going almost every day.

The insecurity does have its advantages--he has great recall when he's out and about in the park--I called his name and ran off once and now he always comes back to me.  He still cringes when we call him or try to get him to follow us in the house but we've circumvented the potty issue at least by teaching him to go to the door when we say ""outside"".  When we go to the door, he's already there so it's not scary for him.  

He's doing well with clicker training and oddly enough, one of the cats has joined in.  When I was teaching the dog to sit, I noticed the cat was sitting on command as well, so I started treating him too.  The cat is a bit more resource motivated than the dog (the cat has a history of being portly and his portion controlled diet is obviously starving him to death) so the cat knows sit, stay, high five and lie down while the dog knows sit, outside and recall.  I've stopped working on lay down and stay to focus on leave it so we can work on don't eat cat poo, don't roll in trash, don't roll in poo, don't bring me dead things and don't roll in dead things.  Then I think we'll teach him fetch because this stubby dog loves to run.  The other cat knows how to fetch, maybe he can teach the dog?  (kidding)

So thank you all for your help, we really appreciate it!  He's seriously the perfect dog--he's happy being a couch potato or being an adventurer, he's wiggly and sweet and loving and it's really great watching this dog blossom, even if he is disgusting. "	t5_2r067	True

Prior to now, the only dog he's bitten was a very aggressive Chihuahua who jumped up and latched onto his face. He shook her off, bit her once on the back and left her alone.

About three weeks ago he was wrestling one of his buddies at the park when a third dog dove in and bit his back leg hard, puncturing his thigh and cutting his anus. 

Since then, he is easily frightened in play situations and quick to get aggressive with other dogs. This culminated in him biting one of his friends at the dog park. He has played with this dog at least once a week for over a year with no problems.

1368143966.0	1e1bc1	Explain like I'm 5: What to do/not to do with my slightly reactive dog	gotcatstyle	16	3	7	"My guy is on the milder end of the reactivity spectrum. I want to make absolutely sure that the way I handle it is guiding him towards getting better, not worse.

His reactivity is limited to dogs (and sometimes deer). He LOVES dogs and loves playing at the dog park. But when we're walking and he sees a dog ahead, he zeroes in on it. He'll try to pull his way over to meet it, and if he gets frustrated it can escalate to loud, frantic barking. If he does get to meet the dog, he greets it politely and quietly and then goes on his way with minimal fuss.

So he's on his way to good manners, and I definitely think he can get there, but I need to know what I can be doing to help him along. 

My strategy so far:

- If the situation allows, I handle the barking by enforcing that quiet = getting closer to dog, loud = sit still and don't get to meet dog.

- If he barks at all, he does not get to greet the dog. If he pulls but does not bark (and the other owner is ok with it) he gets to greet the dog.

My idea is that when the barking stops altogether, then we'll work on the pulling/general excitedness.

Other useful info: he's a 1.5 year old Samoyed, he gets tons of exercise (long runs/walks/dog park romps), we walk with a front clip harness. Also, we do clicker training but I'm not always great about remembering to grab the clicker and treats before we walk out the door. Plus he stops caring about treats when he's in ""omg it's a dog"" mode.

Am I doing anything that could make it worse/hinder improvement? What could I be doing differently/better?

They'll set off barking like crazy at almost any unexpected noise, and since we live in an apartment those sounds are quite frequent. Whenever somebody rings the doorbell one of my sisters dogs starts to yell incredibly loud, if I didn't know any better I'd think he was being tortured. He also does this yelling when my dad drops off our dog(female, lives with him primarily, but stays with us when he works).

They also beg for food in a very obnoxious way. Whenever anyone is handling anything edible, they'll stomp, whimper, stand up against you, jump after the food(good thing they're small), etc. If shoo'd they'll hide under the kitchen table and refuse to come out until you turn your back, then go back to begging.

One of the dogs is also aggressive towards one of them, often growling and sometimes they'll start fighting.

My sister is very clearly the problem, she's even admitted it in the past. She'll yell at them whenever they bark, which I believe only encourages them. She also feeds them at the table, even going as far as to take my plate that I'm finished with and letting her dogs feast on the left-overs.

I can talk this through with my sister and get her on-board, but I'm not sure how I'd even begin to train away this behavior.

Ladygirl26	17	5	20	"I adopted a two year old gsd two days ago and he's been adapting to the stresses of a new home very well.  I'm trying to minimize new situations until we have a stronger bond but today we had to go to the vet (a place his previous owners never took him) for some skin issues.  He took high value treats and did some nice hand targeting even though he was showing a lot of stress signals.

Now a thunder storm is coming through and he's stressing out to the point of not taking treats.  I unfourtunately don't have access to get a thunder shirt right now, nor do I have any compression bandages to mimic one.  

I would usually not allow a dog to practice a behavior I don't want to encourage but with all the new stresses in Barley's life should I let this one go and allow him to hide in a closet?

EDIT: I understand and do not (what My human mind considers ""obviously"") coddle him.  I've been thinking about everyone's responses and when I wrote gleeful I didn't mean excited as in recall-most interesting-thing-in-the-room gleeful.  I ment a lower key ""oh nice to see you"" greeting with the idea that I'd make being with me more comforting than the closet.
But I now see how any reaction in this situation could make him more uneasy.

He's the first dog I've adopted all by myself as an adult. I've worked in animal medicine for six years and have been praised for how calmly I work with and for anxious or aggressive animals.  I guess this tiny experience is just exposing how vulnerable I am about falling into being one of those pet parents who makes her dog crazier.  And everyone sees it but her!

So I totally appreciate the helpful responses.  Barley ended up coming out five minutes after the storm ended and laying in the kitchen while I prepped dinner.  We will keep working on little exposures of new things for him and more self-awareness for me.

1365544717.0	1c0pfo	Overprotective/aggressive tendencies?	Miriahification	15	1	4	"I have a half pit, half little dog mix. His father was of multiple dogs, including shitzu and bull. He is as well behaved at home as I could ask, until someone comes over, a big truck drives past, or a door slams. 

At home, he has various rules. Not allowed on furniture (excluding one sitting chair that is 'his', but he gets down when prompted), not allowed in kitchen when someone else is, and follows odd commands such as 'get back' and 'go get x'. Ruger (the dog), even has a play mate. Him and the cat are constantly playing games with each other and their toys (including bones, ropes, balls and stuffed animals).

When someone new comes over, it's a 50/50 chance he'll like them. We've taken to putting him in the other room when guests come over, it's been too many close calls to chance it. It seems that as he gets older, the less he wants to do with new people (his mother and father are incapable of meeting new people, they would bite). I've also noticed that with large groups of people he becomes very stressed, even when they are all people he knows and loves. 

When someone pulls in the driveway (excluding the mail lady, she's conditioned him with his 'mail'; dog treats) he goes off like an alarm. Same when trucks drive past our home (we live in the country, down the road from a farm, spring time brings many trucks). 

Ruger is also very friendly with children; he is able to play tug of war with a young child (3/4 years old), within their abilities (he tugs hard enough to play with them without knocking them down, it's actually pretty cute). But as soon as it's time for the child/baby to go home, he 'looks sad' and becomes distressed the child is leaving. 

He did bite someone once, it is a bit of a story. We contain him using a PetSafe Wireless Containment System. We plug the box into the wall, it sends a signal to his collar. When he approaches the boundary it beeps to warn him he is approaching his boundary. My boyfriend was standing at this line talking with our (drunk) neighbor, he took a step back to break away from the conversation, and she reached to him and grabbed his upper arm above the elbow (like a cop does when they pull you away). He chomped on her leg, it drew blood but wasn't TOO bad. She healed up nice and good, and they don't trespass anymore. 


This dog hangs on to every word I say. He does get stubborn, (like when asking to lay down he sits. He will NOT lay his head down all the way when prompted. I attribute this as one of his quirks, I wouldn't want to put my head down and totally relax with someone holding a treat in front of my face).


But basically, is there a way to curb his excitement with noises, and slow down his overprotectiveness, while still encouraging 'guard dog' behavior like barking ONLY when new people enter the house?"	t5_2r067	True

They are both great dogs, and have no socialization issues, but as I'm progressing in Buck's training Tinkerbell is getting left out. She has no interest in fetching things, and gets plenty of love. I just feel bad about not working with her as much as I work with Buck.

Any ideas of other things I could train a dog for, that would give her some sense of belonging?

I've only ever had one dog and just adopted a stray Chihuahua.

He has been with me for a few weeks and has a crate and pen in the living area and the same in my room for his sleeping area.

We've had him since he was about 7 weeks. He's done very well in his training classes and in other closed environments like the house, and most pet store scenarios. He's well versed in: come, sit, wait, down, off, up, over, weave, look, and heel.

Problem is, when we go for walks, it seems like he completely forgets he ever knew any of these commands. Any slight distraction can set him off to a streak of ignoring everything said to him. I don't practice any sort of dominance or corrective punishment. A light bat to fix his attention to me, which usually does the trick. Sortof an ""Oh, I didn't realize you were there, were you saying something?"" But then we go right back to ignoring me again.

Again, this is only outside, which I figure is probably just because he's not exposed enough to practicing commands outside... but I figure I'd ask some people who might have a different point of view on this. Thanks in advance for any suggestions."	t5_2r067	True

The main issue is that she thinks everything in the world is her best friend and wants to go play with it. This applies to people (Who she will enthusiastically jump on), and more importantly, cars, which she will chase. 

We live in very remote area, the nearest public road is over a half mile away, and for a long time she had no idea it existed. 
As of now, she understands that just 5 minnutes away there is a wonderful place with big fluffy things that want to play with her.

So we got a shock collar (go ahead, roast me at the stake); She gives no shits. Either she cant feel it, (even at the highest setting with shaved fur) or she simply doesn't care. Either way it is ineffective. (The bloody thing makes me jump a foot in the air)

Part of the issue is that she would rather chase a car than anything else, and if she keeps doing what she is doing, she will die very quickly, and/or cause a very expensive collision that we will be responsible for. It would be a huge shame to never let her out of the house, and it would kill us to have to tie her up all the time.

People I have talked to have thrown out phrases like ""positive reinforcement"", but never seem to be able to explain the finer details when I ask for advice.

Until about a month ago, we had a great breakfast/dinner routine:  at the appropriate time, I would fill their bowls, have them sit, set the bowls down, and they would start eating when I said ""ok"".  The younger one would finish eating first, then go stare longingly at the older one from a comfortable distance.
  
Lately, my older girl has had less of an appetite.  She is especially disinterested in her morning meal (even if we exercise first).  That alone isn't a big deal, the weather is getting warmer and she's getting older so I'm not too concerned yet (she's still eating and pooping every day).  

The problem is my younger girl.  She is hungry.  She whines at her full food bowl and barks at the other one to encourage her to eat.  But she refuses to eat unless her big sis does.  After a few minutes of that, she usually goes and lies down, giving up on breakfast.  

I'm worried that when I trained her to wait for my cue to start eating, she was actually picking up on the wrong cue- the other dog eating.  How can I let her know it's ok to eat?

1363661645.0	1akinu	Need help training a dog that doesn't normally bark to bark on command. Cats can get him to bark, but I'm not sure if I should use them for training.	sackbandit	17	3	6	"Hi Reddit!

I have a 4 year old chihuahua who I'm trying to train the speak command. He rarely barks so it's difficult to reward him for it. However, he barks the most when he's trying to get my cats to play with him. 

He's calm around them, doesn't chase them around the house, but occasionally he'll go up to one and do the play bow with his tail wagging. The cats ignore him so he'll bark at them while in the bowing position (don't worry, the cats don't feel threatened at this point. They're like ""whatever"" and continue to ignore).

Since this is one of the rare times he barks, I would like to use this somehow to train him the speak command, without him assosciating the reward he gets for barking AT the cats. They coexist pretty well.

I've read online that you can use your dog's favorite toy, or treat, by waving it around in front of him without allowing him to have it. Eventually he'll become frustrated enough to bark, and then reward. I've tried this through a few sessions but I cannot get him to make a sound. 

Any suggestions? Is it a good idea to use the cats to teach the speak command?

Airedale/Golden mix rescued 1 and a half weeks ago has developed issues with our kids	Iroh_King_of_Pop	13	0	10	"Background: We got Abe a couple weeks ago and right from the start he seemed like a sweet dog. The kids loved him, he seem to love the attention. Starting at the end of this past week he started making noises when my 5 yo daughter was petting him that at first sounded like happy sighs, but progressed to growls and nips. Not enough to break the skin but enough to scare her. We told her that for now if she wants to pet him she has to do it with us so that we can make sure nothing happens. In what may be a related issue whenever my wife is hugging the kids Abe will dart in and try to get between and sometimes try and pull the child away. In fact last night at bedtime my daughter was coming over for a hug goodnight and Abe jump to his feet, put himself between us and started growling like he was protecting my from my 40 lb daughter. 

We are not sure what to do. We start Obedience training this Saturday, which I'm hoping will help and are looking at the possibility of a private animal behaviorist. The fact is we love this dog (the kids still adore him even with all of the problems), he is very sweet with me and my wife, but our kids come first. Is there any way to show him that the kids are not a threat but part of the pack?

1361299911.0	18tz6i	My dog is suddenly terrified of her crate	wtfpwndd	13	1	6	"My 7 year old pup has been crate trained for well over a year now. She would go into it without issue and sleep in it almost every night, even if we opened the gate. This all seemed to change last weekend, when my brother was over.

Since I don't have people over often, I took this as an oppertunity to train the dog about barking. Just before my brother came into the house I put her in her crate and sure enough, she started barking when he came in. I waited for her to stop barking and then came in and gave her treats.

I repeated this process for maybe an hour to an hour and a half: everytime she would bark I'd leave the room and then, if she were quiet, I'd come in and shower her with treats and praise.

That night, she slept in her crate and all was well. The next day I repeated the same thing as the day before but that night she went CRAZY in her crate in the middle of the night. She started scratching at the bars and breathing very heavily. I tried to wait for her to be quiet and then give her a treat but she wouldn't even eat it. Her face was covered in drool after having been in there in this state for several minutes. Since she didn't take the treat and she was still calm, I took her out of the crate and she immediately fell asleep next to me on the couch.

I switched out her bedding in case that was the issue but the next night, it happened again but without enough pause to reward her or get her out. Eventually, she bent the very bars of the crate and even cut her paw. She even threw up. I didn't realize she had cut herself because she was whining already but when I heard her throw up I immediately went over and took her out. This was maybe after 30 minutes of being left alone. She was covered in drool again and clearly panicky.

Is it possible that she is just done with crates? I'm kind of afraid to put her in one now since she injured herself. I just don't know what caused the issue since it seemingly came out of the blue..."	t5_2r067	True

He is a 10 month old, boxer/shepard/husky/lab mix, about 75 pounds.  I took him to obedience classes from a highly recommended and experience trainer when he was 6-7 months old.  He is good with the basic commands of sit, down, come (most of the time), leave it, etc.  In class we were supposed to be leaning/teaching the heel command using a chain choke collar.  I tried practicing with him, but he was just in that stage (note: before he got fixed) where he did not want to listen like a rebellious teenager.  The choke collar seemed to not affect him at all; he would pull right through it and not respond when I would tighten it up.

Before the class and even now, I prefer bringing him somewhere he can be off leash, usually the woods, a large park, the dog park, erie canal. He is very good about not running away at places like these.  If he is off leash and there is a person far away, I can get him on his leash by making him come and sit or by turning around to walk the other way and he will follow.

When he does need to be on his leash, I was continuing to use the choke collar up until about a month ago.  It proved very ineffective and made it impossible for me to control him if he pulls (especially on ice/snow).  I've recently been using a harness that has mesh in the front and tightens around his legs when he pulls (presumably making it uncomfortable for him) that helps *a lot* but if he sees something he wants, he can still pull me.  I also don't particularly like the harness because I'm afraid it promotes his pulling, but it makes it so much easier for us to go on runs around the neighborhood.  

So pulling is issue number 1, and if it gets resolved, I bet it will help greatly with these next issues.

He barks at strangers, a lot.  I don't mind if they are strangers in my house or if he's barking in the backyard, but when we are on trails (erie canal, specifically) it really bothers other people.  I am confident he would never bite anyone except maybe if I was being attacked, but his barking has become an issue.  If he is off his leash and he runs by someone he doesn't know, he will stop within 3 feet (never get closer) and bark continuously at him/her.  Dog lovers understand and don't mind him, but most people get scared.  It is basically like a small, yippee dog that is barking at somebody, except he is huge and has a scary bark!  His hair stands up initially, but if he is barking and a stranger was to lunge at him, his tail would go between his legs and he backs off.

When we go by somebody and he is on the leash, he will bark a little (I can normally drag him away), but he tries to jump at them.  If he is off-leash, he will *not* jump at strangers, it is only if he is on the leash.  I am pretty strong for a person my size, and can control him fairly well, but he is right on my limit and it makes people (and myself) uncomfortable.  Also I should mention he pulls *hard* when he sees other dogs because he really wants to play.  He is fantastic with other dogs (chases, wrestles, avoids aggressive dogs/fights, gentle with smaller dogs), but always wants to play and nearly rips my arm out trying to get to them.

Since his problems are very situation-specific I'm not sure what to do.  He is overall a very good boy, he just has a somewhat guard dog mentality and a pulling problem, but only sometimes!  I would try to keep him away from places with people, but I don't think that should be an answer to the problem and he is so high energy that he needs his exercise.  We love running together and he will go for miles before he's tired, but it's exhausting trying to control him on runs when there are people around."	t5_2r067	True

Hey everyone, I am getting an 8 week old golden doodle this Saturday. This is my wife and I's first dog together. We have been researching and learning about dogs since this past summer, when we knew that we would be getting one forsure. We are both very excited and I just wanted to vocalize my plan for this pup and see if I am on the right track. I am completely open to any advice especially people that have raised this type of dog before. 

We have both read positive training books by Ian Dunbar and Pat Miller. We are planning on taking the first week off of work between the both of us and crate training to make potty training and getting a consistant schedule down easier. 

I really want to make the crate a great place for her. I am hoping that after 5 days at our place she will be comfortable staying in her crate for 3 hours at a time during the day. We have family to come by and let her out at 10am and 1pm then we get home at 4pm. I am hoping to slowely increase her time in the crate over the first few days so this won't be a surprise for her once the day hits we both head to work. Is this the best way to set up for success?

My other biggest goal in the first few weeks is to bring the dog out every hour or so to go potty and reward greatly any time she goes outside in her spot. I am going to get the whole family on the same page so when other people bring her out we all do the same thing and use the same words such as ""go potty"".

My last goal is to get everybody (we have tons of family and friends that are so excited to meet/play with the dog) to reward calm behavior with her food, treats, and toys. We currently have a puppy kong, a puppy kong that looks like a bone, and a elk antler to munch on. We are signing her up for puppy socialization classes on saturday mornings and a puppy obedience class. Both will be at 12 weeks once she gets her final shots. 

I hope this wall of text isn't to much rambling and I appreciate anybody who takes the time to read through and offer advice. I think I am just anxious / nervous about raising a bad dog and need some reinforcment that I am on the right track. Only my wife and I are up to date on dog training and our families are a little less into the whole ""training thing"". For example, they may think me taking the pup and putting her in the crate for a bit when people are over might be ""mean"" and I will try my best to explain why we are doing it etc... 

Any advice or questions are welcome.

1359336962.0	17eg26	Trouble with girlfriends dog	breuwar	16	4	12	"My girlfriend and I have been together about 1 year, living together for about 6 months. GF has a dog, she's a mutt, 20 lbs, adorable, but the most infuriating dog in the world. I'm not really a dog person, but I try to hard to get along with this dog. This might end up being a wall of text so forgive me ahead of time.

The trouble with the dog has always been there, because she can't control her bladder to save her life. It used to be (before we lived together) when I would come over the dog would immediately piss herself (and sometimes on my pants/shoes). I always figured she was just super excited and it was kind of endearing. She's gotten better about that but occasionally she will still piss all over the carpet when I go to pet her. It is frustrating to clean up after her all the time but it's not the end of the world.

The real trouble is when it comes to any amount of training. This dog will not even SIT unless you trick her into thinking you have food. I think this comes from gf giving the dog food from the table (which I have protested about 1 billion times, gf won't budge, tale for another day though) and the dog just being....herself. She barks at people, yelps as if I were beating her relentlessly when I go to just barely spank her (making gf think that I am abusive), and if she shits in the house, she shits in MY OFFICE (where my computer, books, etc is). I think she is being a spiteful little shit, I'm not going to lie. She did it at the old house we had with and in the new apartment. Wherever my stuff is, she poops. Why?!

Now here is the real trouble, and where I need help fast. The girlfriend is gone on a roadtrip with her father to a gem show in the west. I have about a week and a half to two weeks to make this dog worth a damn before gf gets back and babies it into oblivion. I'm all about loving your pets but what is the point when they just act like shit? Anyway, off to a bad start. I took the dog out 3 times today, and she would not go to the restroom for me AT ALL. I did all the tricks, took her to her favorite spot, used an encouraging voice, I even have one of the variable length leashes so that I can follow her at a large distance and give her some privacy. She just wouldn't do it. I even stood outside with her, walked her around the entire complex 3 times, probably a total 30 to 45 min walk, maybe more (which is more than she normally gets out of either of us). I am well aware that this dog doesn't trust me, it all started when she chewed up the remote to our surround sound system that we just got, I lost my cool and yelled at her and spanked her (probably harder than normal) and chased her into her crate (which I know you aren't supposed to use as a form of punishment). 

I suppose what I'm saying is: I need some help with this dog that I a) don't have to go to a dog trainer for, b) can't find from Google (already looked, that's why I'm posting here, hoping for some good insight), and c) can (at the very least) just lay down some foundation to improve my relationship with this dog. This girl means everything to me and I am honestly doing my best to make it work with this dog, usually when gf is here everything is fine but when gf is gone (like she is for this whole week and then some) the dog is a demon and won't listen to me at all. 

Now my absolute last resort is that I can drop the dog off at the dog hotel thing like gf and I did when we went home for xmas, but that is $ I don't want to spend and is giving up a great opportunity to bond a little with this dog. 

TL;DR - GF's dog is a little demon when GF isn't around, need some help for forging a good relationship with this dog to save my sanity for the next two weeks.

**EDIT: Wow, I did not expect so many responses, let alone so many useful ones. Thank you very much to everyone who posted, it is too many posts to respond individually but I can assure you all that every post will be taken into account over the next couple of weeks (and beyond, in fact).

It's hard to pinpoint when exactly it began, but sometime between 6mo and 1yo she began being afraid of strangers (I lay a lot of the blame on my neighbor who would ride toward her aggressively on his bike with the intention of scaring her. But I also know that her breeds are prone to such behavior). Now, it is absolutely expected that she will bark aggressively at any stranger who walks in through our front door (she does not typically bark at folks walking on the sidewalk). Very recently she has toned down some on the barking, but has delivered a few unexpected nips that do not break the skin, or leave any mark at all, but still, no growling or anything, just nips someone when they try to navigate the house without paying attention to her (in their bum), or if they suddenly and quickly move their hand toward her face.

I am desperate to end this behavior. I have tried the following:

* flipping her on her back and showing dominance after she barks. (she is very quick to submit to me)

* restraining her and allowing the stranger to pet her.

* putting her in her kennel after barking.

* putting her in her kennel before the stranger enters the house.

* putting her in a separate room before the stranger enters the house.

* having treats outside the front door and having all strangers throw a few at her as they enter (she completely ignores the treats).

In all of these instances, the moment that she has the chance she will race toward the intruder barking. It's scary, really. I have no idea what to do and I am tired of it. So, I have two question for anyone willing to help:

1) Do you have any suggestions? Training help?

2) Would you recommend using a [remote control shock collar](http://www.amazon.com/GROOVYPETS-CONTROL-RECHARAGEABLE-VIBRATION-TRAINING/dp/B005Z27X8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358717557&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=remote+control+collar)? It goes against everything I believe in, but, at this point, I am willing to resort to it.

When he sees a person, he totally flips out and barks, growls, lunges for them, wagging his tail... I literally end up choking him out with the choker chain, it sucks. He almost knocked me over today trying to get to some other lady walking like 2 blocks away.

When he's in the yard and someone is walking buy, he flips out barking and barking and runs up to the line (we have an electric fence) and resumes flipping out until the person walks past.

"	sacheltry	15	1	14	"When we play fetch, she will come back with the ball/stick/toy and then jump and bite at our arms/chest etc even though the ball/stick/toy is still in her mouth. It can be painful.

Last night as we walked back I had a flashlight with me. She started to chase it. So I thought that was a fun game for her. Although as what happens with games, as she's running she runs up to me, jumps and bites. I think it is more playful as she's not biting down, but she shouldn't be biting at all (right?). She's already ripped my jacket and my son's. If I have a treat or even if I don't and say, ""Sit"" she will eventually sit and stop. The other thing is she doesn't do this with my wife at all. My wife walks her and pets her, and talks to her, but my wife never plays with her. The dog only does it with my kids and me - the ones who play with her.

We are working on teaching ""Drop"". She does seem to be getting it, but it's not perfect (I know this takes time).  Often the game with a toy becomes a tug-of-war. My understanding is that this is just teaching her more aggression. So we'd like to teach her some new games. We have done Hide 'n Seek and that goes pretty well. But we are looking for fun games that help my dog grow and be healthy.

My 6 mo. old corgi is not only biting now but he is humping and when I give him a firm ""no"" or ""off"" he gets extremely upset and immediately starts to bite my arms which is what I am using to protect myself from his biting.

he wont get to, he starts barking like crazy and pulling and jumping and tugging.    I am 6 foot  1 and in pretty good shape and I have trouble containing him.

I really need help figuring out what I can do, how I can train him to behave/be calm and be controllable when he ""freaks"" out.

He's a wonderful dog. Extremely well behaved, calm and has been used as a therapy type dog for one of the rescues here in Houston for the last year and is wonderful at it. The problem is, he's extremely stubborn. When we go to schools and whatnot, he's perfect with kids and has the most amazing temperament. When we're out in public he stays right next to me, has never pulled on the leash and even off leash stays close to me at all times. When we need him to do something like sit, lay down, stay, etc.. it takes a bit. Even with treats, he does it when he likes. 

I've been working with him the last 3 months, about 10-15 minutes most nights, and he still does stuff when he wants to. He knows what he needs to do, he just doesn't do it. I've tried multiple types of treats, he has no interest in toys, lots of praise, markers and a variety of things, yet he still does it when he feels like it. When we go to take a walk, I make him sit before I put the leash on him. he looks at me, I say sit and put up my index finger (we do signals and words both, index finger up is sit, index finger down is lay down) an he looks at me then looks around at other things. After a few times, I'll say it again and take a step closer to him, directly in front, and he does it. It's a lot like he just doesn't pay attention until he feels like it. I guess that's what the main problem is, he doesn't pay attention until he gets bored of not getting something. I know with stubborn dogs you have to be just as stubborn and not give in, but what other things could I do to grab his attention more. I've looked at a few articles on building focus with your dog but none seem to help since I can't find something that grabs his attention enough or something that he really really wants. 

We're planning to do the CGC class with him soon and the trainer with rescue says he could easily pass if I could just get him to do things on command. It's just getting him to pay attention and actually do it when I say is the issue. Any ideas, suggestions or advice on how to address the issue?? "	t5_2r067	True
1351138915.0	121so6	I don't know how to correct this aggression! I'm at my wits end. Please help! 	chocolatehearts	14	0	8	"I currently have three dogs, 18 month old border collie x bull arab neutered male, no medical problems, had him the longest adopted from a family at 3 month old. 7 month old pure bred golden retriever, neutered male, no medical problems, bought from a breeder, had him for the last 5 months. 16 month old pure bred golden retriever, spayed female, no medical problems, adopted recently (about a month ago) from a family that no longer wanted her.
So the problem is the mixed mutt. He seems to be showing (and escalating) aggression and I'm not sure what is causing it or what to do about it. It's showing in all areas, food, play, territorial, walks/swims etc.

About a week ago we took him (Niko) to the river by himself. We have a 15metre rope that we clip him too that we can tie to a tree because otherwise he wouldn't come back to us. So we were swimming and everything was fine until I noticed a couple walking their dogs along the bank. Niko noticed them and it went from 0-10 in 2seconds. He charged the other dogs and ran to the end of the rope and choking himself out. Then he got up and charged them again. I am positive that if the rope had of snapped, he would have attacked those dogs. It was horrible and embarrassing.

A week later I got some kibble and sprinkled it all around our yard, which they seemed to enjoy. All three dogs would graze it up like sheep and it kept them busy. I went inside to go to the toilet and heard squealing. Niko had our golden puppy pinned down, biting his legs. My partner ran outside and yelled at him to stop and he did.
Yesterday all three of them were playing and Niko bit the female on the back, which caused her to snap at him and it escalated into a full on fight. I clapped my hands and yelled STOP IT STOP IT and they broke apart. Then kissed (??)

Later that night, I had fed them all (in separate rooms) and let the puppy out to see Niko. Niko was looking at a treat I had put up out of reach so he wouldn't eat it. The puppy went to kiss(?)/lick his face and he snapped and bit the puppy. Puppy yelped and I yelled.

I thought maybe it could be a jealously issue. So today I let Niko into the loungeroom with just him and I and gave him a bone to chew and some attention. When he was done I let him back out to the other dogs and the puppy went over to kiss him and he snarled, then bit the pup on the face. Puppy peed himself and I separated them all again. 


I don't know what is going on. I can't figure out why he is suddenly doing this. He's never shown aggression to the pup before, it breaks my heart. The goldens are the most kind natured dogs and here is this mutt, bullying them. I don't know how to correct it and I don't know if a trainer would help?

Any advice would be wonderful. Thank you for reading"	t5_2r067	True
1350493853.0	11mzvc	Non-aggressive humping at the dog park: what's the best way to handle it?	gotcatstyle	16	2	10	"Hi again, Dogtraining! You guys were great when [Figaro](http://imgur.com/0CCY5) and I were having some off-leash trust issues, so maybe you can help me out with this one. Couldn't find an existing thread that addressed this particular issue.

Fig is an 11mo, neutered Samoyed who I adopted when he was 8mo. I don't know anything about his early socialization, but it must have been pretty healthy because he loves other dogs and adores the dog park. Being a big puppy, he can get rambunctious, but he always plays nicely and has never started a fight. 

Thing is, he's a humper. It's a regular thing I have to watch out for whenever a new dog comes in. It's not every dog; mostly males, but not necessarily un-neutered ones. Some dogs tolerate it, others tell him to back off; when they do, he does - briefly - then usually tries again. 

My response so far has been to stay nearby so I can pull him off if he mounts another dog, then make him sit for 30 seconds and/or throw a tennis ball to distract him. Eventually, once the new dog has settled in and everyone is playing together, he will stop and play nicely. 

I understand he's asserting dominance and trying to establish himself at the top of the dog park hierarchy, but I don't know how I should be responding. I certainly don't want to do anything that might create aggression, because he is not aggressive at all - just a kid trying to be the big man on campus. I want him to understand that he doesn't need to dominate other dogs to play with them. Like I said, there's no aggression, no snarling or snapping on his part, but when he meets a MORE dominant dog than himself there can be problems even before the humping starts - he's been snarled and snapped at by dominant males, and recently a particularly cranky 13mo standard poodle really went for him as soon as he entered the park.

Is this all just a necessary part of doggy interaction? Am I doing more harm than good in pulling him off and giving him a time out? Is there a better way to handle it? 

Thanks for reading, and thanks for any advice you might have!"	t5_2r067	True

They are fed in this room and they sleep in this room yet she always ""goes"" in here. It's not just when we go out either, she'll sneak up to the room even if we're in the house.

They are taken out to the park a few times a day and also let out into the garden several times and i know there is no problem with my other dog as i see her do her ""business"" when outside.

The dog is never punished for making a mess as i know this can make the problem worse but I don't know how i can positively condition her (treats etc) as she never ""goes"" outside. We treat her and show lots of attention if we come home and the room is clean, but i don't think she knows why she's being treated.

We went to the beach with our 8 mo. old golden the other day.  It was the hottest day of the year thus far, so lots of people (and dogs) were there.  I don't have any issues with friendly dogs being off the leash.  how we operate with our dog is that if no one is around for a few hundred feet, we take her off the leash while we play fetch.  If someone walks our way or another dog comes along then she goes back on the leash.  If the other dog is friendly then we'll let her play off leash with it (after introductions are made).  This all works out great.

Well, we get about half way down the beech on our walk and come across a guy with a German Shepherd off leash.  I am suspicious that the dog may be aggressive based on the fact that the owner was standing over him as soon as we came by looking ready to move.  initial introduce goes well, then suddenly his dog growls and lunches at ours.  ours jumps away and the owner has the dog on the ground by the ear (yipping).

I have a few comments on this:

1) It's great that he was aware and trying to socialize his dog.  I'm glad he was remaining vigilant.

2) Your dog is aggressive.  Don't socialize it by taking it to an _extremely_ crowded beach and then letting it around off leash.  Our dog did _not_ trigger his dog, our dog is extremely well socialized and friendly.  Her only issue is that she's trying to learn to read signals and sometimes ""puppy plays"" when she shouldn't...she did not do that this time.

3)  Hurting your dog when it acts aggressive does not improve aggression, in fact...it will make it worse.  Instead, socialize it and reward for positive interactions.

We came back about 45 minutes later, and guess what...the dog was still off leash and by then the owner had quit paying attention to it.  On the way back I got to observe it as we walked towards it and noticed it seemed to be avoiding the water, so I had my wife walk with my dog right next to the water and walked with myself between the German Shepherd and our dog.

I think my biggest annoyance is #2 above.  Why in the fucking hell would you have your dog-aggressive dog off-leash in a location that literally has hundreds of dogs?  Ours was on a leash and if he hadn't been quick enough there would have been no way to stop his dog as we tried to pull ours away and get her safe."	t5_2r067	True
1339165935.0	urlth	Did I ruin my dog with my ignorance?	Gogo85	13	1	8	"So I have a 1 year old chihuahua I've had since he was 8 wks old. Until February he spent the whole work day with free reign of our rec room. We had trained him on puppy pads, but this seemed to teach him to pee with anything fabric or paper under his feet. Leave so much as a sock or receipt on the ground and he'd pee on it.

Final straw was when he started peeing on the suede coach. So I researched how to crate train and he's doing awesome! Only thing is that we still can't leave him alone. If left in a room alone for literally less than a minute we risk him peeing on the furniture, though hell never have an accident if we either crate him/put him outside/bring him with us when we leave a room. 

I realized my training I tried right before the crate was wrong because we tried the nose-rub method and I think he just got confused. Now I think he is scared to pee or poop in front of us. He's never in his life done his business on walks and I can sit outside with him for over an hour and he won't go unless he thinks I'm not looking so I have to try to catch him out of my peripheral to give him praise. 

I really want to fix this thing I've done. Ive never had a dog before and my ignorance is apparent. I think he'd have done great if we'd started with a crate from the beginning. Where do I go from here? I want to be able to trust him to be alone long enough so I can go to the bathroom without taking him with me. I feel like catching him peeing is the key so I can praise him but I honestly don't have time to wait an hour with him every time when I know he'll go in minutes if I leave. 

Sorry so long! Please help if you can.

EDIT: i should state he is successfully housetrained to an extent. He never pees or poos in the house as long as we're watching him and has only gone on the couch twice in 12 weeks of training. Those are the only accidents and the only times he was left alone. 

I think my real question is, if I keep doing what I'm doing, will we eventually be able to trust him to be alone in the house? Is it just because its so new (about 3 months of crate training so far) that he reverts to old habits when we leave or does something need to change? I literally cannot wait with him to pee, I can give him maybe 20 minutes but I don't have time otherwise except maybe in the evenings.

1317254156.0	kunwe	Just got a new pup. How do we train her to not chew on anything but toys?	Taxi_06	15	2	12	We recently adopted a black lab puppy who is about 16 weeks old. She seems to be catching on quickly to simple things such as her name and that outside is where she is supposed to use the bathroom. But one thing I have noticed is that she likes to chew on things, usually shoes and the handles of hairbrushes. We currently have her living in our garage (which we made pet friendly, of course) where we will be training her before we bring her into the house. We have provided her with chew toys and dog treats like a pig's ear to chew on, which she seems to enjoy. My question is, how do we teach her that chew toys are the only things she is supposed to chew on and how do we prevent her from destroying shoes and furniture when we bring her into the house?

She's a Beagle mix about 3-4 years old. Her foster owners said she had only one accident while they had her and that was during Fourth of July. With us, she's had an accident about every other day or so. Lately it's been when we are about to go outside. She sees me holding her collar and leash and runs to the couch or bed and starts peeing.

We've been doing positive reinforcement while on walks and giving her treats when she pees outside, as well as praising her. I know she had a clean bill of health from her foster owners and that they had a fenced in backyard so she's not used to only going out at certain times of the day.

1375384909.0	1jii58	Suddenly Sitting on Walks (new behaviour)	crispy-fried-lego	17	3	9	"Apologies for the incoming wall of text!

Everything has been going really well with my 5 and a half month old bullmastiff in terms of training. He is fully crate trained; gets put in his crate at about 11pm and doesn't wake up or want out until 10am the next morning (I feel like I won the puppy lottery in this aspect). He knows leave it to the point where you can put his favourite treat right under his nose and he won't take it until you say ""okay."" He is doing well on meeting new people and dogs (he used to get way over-excited and thought everyone should play with him) and we are now able to get him to hold a (admittedly wiggly) sit while people and dogs come up and say hello. 

Recently however we have been facing a new behaviour with him: sitting on walks. When we first started leash training him, he was a nightmare! He pulled, zig-zagged, tried to chase every small animal he saw, and was just in general a real ordeal. 

But we've been working really hard with him over the past few months (using the stopping until he came back and focused on us was grueling, but definitely worked) and he was able to consistently walk on a loose leash right at your side, looking up at you every minute or so. We were so excited by this progress, as it became a real joy to walk him (although even when it wasn't so pleasant we made sure to get him out at least twice a day). 

Then, about a week ago, I didn't get home until much later than normal and so when I took him out for his evening walk it was dark out.  He has been out in our backyard in the dark to go potty, but all his previous walks have been when it is still light out. He was clearly uncomfortable on the walk (extra alert, ears back) and when he heard an animal rustling in the bushes he plastered himself to my leg and tucked his tail between his legs. I knew I had done too much, too fast in this new environmental setting and so turned around and headed home. 

I'm worried though that I have damaged his confidence on walks. Since that nighttime walk he now has a new habit of sitting down on a walk (for reasons I can't always detect) and looking around. He doesn't seem scared (his body language suggests that he's not, and no whining), but instead seems to be curious about whatever has caught his attention. Sometimes it is obvious: a man mowing his lawn, construction workers using power tools, but other times I can't figure out what has caused him to stop and sit.

I am able to lure him back into a walk with treats after quite a bit of coaxing, but maybe half a block later he does the same thing again. At 5 and a half months he already weighs 65 pounds, so picking him up is not an option, but he was stuck in a sit for almost 10 minutes yesterday and wouldn't budge even for treats. 

I'm at a loss as to what my next step should be. He really doesn't seem fearful, but instead I would describe his behaviour as inquisitive or assessing. It all started with that nighttime walk, so I feel like that is connected to this new behaviour. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"	t5_2r067	True
1375280142.0	1jf6ww	16 week old golden retriever behavior change - crying loudly in crate - previously she was much quieter	Gendron5000	15	1	13	"Since we've gotten our golden retriever puppy at 8.5 weeks, we've been crate training her.  We haven't used treats, as she hasn't really minded being put in there; doesn't struggle or try (very hard) to escape before we close the door.  At night, she'll fall asleep (not in the crate) about an hour before we go to bed.  When we wake her up to put her in the crate, she'll usually walk right in on her own.  When we open the crate door to let her out, she waits for us to put on her harness before even trying to get out and doesn't try to bolt out of it.

She almost always whined when we put her in the crate, but it was very quiet and lasted less than a minute or two before she'd go to sleep.  She'd usually sleep for about 1.5 - 2.5 hours before waking up and whining to be let out.  We would wait until she stopped whining for 30 seconds to a minute before coming in and letting her out.

In the last few days, she has been whining/barking/crying much louder when we put her in the crate, and for much longer; 15 - 20 minutes.  She'll also wake up about every 45 minutes and whine a bit (this also never happened before).  If it has been less than 1.5 hours, we ignore her, and she'll go back to sleep.

She isn't displaying any behaviors that make us think that it is the crate itself she doesn't like, we almost think it is just being left alone that is the problem.  For example, she doesn't try to escape or freak out (other than the whining/barking/crying) when we initially put her in her crate (just like before), and when we open the door to let her out, she still calmly waits for us to put on the harness (also just like before).  

It is just when we leave the room after putting her in the crate that her behavior has changed from quiet whining to loud crying.

The only two things that have happened in the last week is that she had a bacterial infection, but she has been healthy for about 4 or 5 days now.  She didn't display the louder behavior when she was sick, it started a few days after she seemed completely better (ie solid poo, full energy/appetite).  The other thing that happened is that on Monday, she was playing with a (slightly) bigger dog and the dog knocked her down a few times, kind of hard, but not enough for her to stop playing or yelp or run to me or anything that would make me think anything was wrong.  But maybe she hurt something?  The last few days she's been walking/running the same as always, so I don't really think it is that.

For now, we've just been suffering through the 15 - 20 minutes of whining, but it's just the sudden change of behavior that has us wondering if anything is wrong.  Our guess is that she's just going through a phase and it will slowly get better.  We will be going to the vet in a couple days for her last round of shots, so we will be able to get her checked out as well.

Any thoughts/ideas/suggestions?  Thanks a lot!

She hasn't done much training with him besides sit, shake, and NOOOO!. Lately she has decided to start hardcore 'training' him since he's been acting up (being nippy, not coming when called, jumping on the couch). I've always known she believes in yelling, nose-smacking, scruff-pulling, dragging away, type of training. She has been pretty unsuccessful with her training so far. (He still won't lay down unless she forces him down). I myself have a 9 mos. old puppy that I've been doing purely positive reinforcement training with (and clicker) and it's been immensely successful! For the sake of her poor dog (who always looks so downtrodden when I've visited lately) is there any way I could convince her that she's probably doing more harm than good, or introduce her to positive reinforcement training?

Does anyone have remedial tips?	smbtuckma	12	0	13	"Some background info about the dog: he's half cattle dog half chihuahua, neutered, and lives at home with my family and our one older dog. I'm normally away from home for college so I didn't get to spend much time with this pup when he was younger. When I came back this summer, I found him to be very sweet and playful, but on the leash is worse than a runaway tractor. He barks and growls at passing people/dogs, jerks violently towards wild animals he sees, and at all other times is pulling forward so hard I'm really worried for his trachea. I've asked my family why they never bothered to train him, and the only answer I get is ""we're too busy"" or ""he'll grow out of it."" So there's been more than a year of reinforcement with this behavior.

I've tried using the resources posted here about leash training, but those don't work because I can't find a treat with high enough reward for him to pay attention to when we're outside. If I walk him on a leash up and down the hallway indoors with treats he's very good, but as soon as we step out the door anywhere the treat and I do not exist to him, even if it's a piece of steak I just cooked...

Do you guys have any tips for making the transition to outside walking for a very remedial dog? And something that will last in his memory? I leave for school again in a month, and I'm pretty sure no one else will work with him. I'm concerned that another year of this behavior will result in a fight with another dog, an injury, or something else I don't want to happen. "	t5_2r067	True

First I just tried setting a timer and taking her out of the lead to pee. I followed the rule of thumb that she could hold it for 1 hour per month she is old + 1. So a 4 hour timer. I quickly learned that she pee's much more frequently than that. With a three hour timer I had very limited success. Currently I'm trying two hours and have more success, but she still pee's everywhere. And I often find more I did not catch.

I heard crate training is a great way. I bought a crate for her, and she has spent 2+ hours in there a few times with very little bother. However, I notice she has gone in there specifically to pee twice. This is the opposite of what should happen, she should not want to pee in her crate. 

And I'm getting stressed now. I'm cleaning pee all the time and I'm sure the house is starting to smell. I've not been hard on her. When I catch her I shout in a firm voice 'outside!' but that's it. I'm not sure what to do.   "	t5_2r067	True

1373473803.0	1i0l92	Need Advice about English Mastiff	Sbtocu	16	3	8	"I have an 11 month old English Mastiff (first Mastiff I've owned). He is not neutered, but will be later this week to hopefully help with some behavior issues. I've done several training classes with him, but they were all focused on treat training. What I have now is a dog that will only listen to me if I have a treat for him. He is also incredibly spoiled (my fault). I let him on furniture, I put away his crate months ago, etc.

Most of the time he's the sweetest dog I've ever known, but he has 2 MAJOR behavior problems that have come up recently: 1. He will go crazy for food / treats around other dogs. Around people he is gentle with food, but he has bitten another dog (not hard, but more than nipping) trying to get all of the treats for himself. 2. He has started barking at little kids. I mean right in their faces. He was always great with kids as a puppy, but hasn't been around them much since then.

I started with a new trainer that said both issues are likely caused by how spoiled he is. She says treat training doesn't usually work for a Mastiff and she wants to do corrective training. We started it last night by using a training collar to make him heel while walking in a circle. It started out ok, but after several tugs at the collar he started slowing down. She told me to tug harder when he did that, so I did. He started to bite at the leash, then he even started to bite at me. He has never shown any aggression towards any adult human, especially me, so I was shocked by that. She told me she expected it and it's a normal response to what he sees as a challenge for dominance. Is that correct? Should I keep up with this training even after his response to it? If so, does anybody have any tips for how to ease the transition?

Thanks for any advice!

1373280690.0	1huv0u	X-Post from r/dogs: Help, my dog is turning dog-aggressive :(	ohmanilovethecake	13	2	12	"This is probably going to be a long one, but I want to explain as clearly as possible, I'll conclude a TL;DR.

So, we are a young couple and we have two dogs, a 7 month old corgi called Bria and a 2,5 year old Belgian Shepherd cross, Oscar. This post is about Oscar.

We got him 1,5 years ago from a shelter. He has been trough a lot: he originally belonged to homeless people who used him to beg for money. I don't know if he was seized or given up; but he ended up in the shelter. A lady adopted him thinking it would be nice for her child but soon after returned him again since it turns out it's not easy to take care of a 3 year old and a young dog (duh).

Oscar is affectionate, calm and sensible, not your typical happy-go-lucky enthousiastic dog. He always looks really pensive and he probably is. He came with a problem: chewing up all our stuff, so when he is alone, we crate him. The first year we had him, we didn't have dog-related problems with him. He got along with 98% of other dogs and went to the dog park regularly to play with them.

The problems started after we moved house, from busy city center to rural setting. We think his life quality has improved, we have a yard now and a second dog with whom he gets along great. They love to play and run. The move was now 6 months ago, the new puppy 5 months. I would think that's enough time for him to get used to the new situation?

What started at soft growling at 2% of dogs we passed, has now escalated to some sort of Russian roulette when we meet other dogs, and he is now barking and growling, snapping and acting really nasty. We don't pull him away hurredly or punish him for behaving that way, instead we park him in a sit and try to reward him for calm behavior. If we have enough time, we talk to the other owner so we can slowly, gradually get Oscar closer to their dog. Sometimes, we can get him close, he sniffs the other dog and is fine. Most times, however, not.

We consulted a behaviorist who gave us above tips. He is coming back to see Oscar again later this week.
In the mean time, do you guys have any tips? What can we do for Oscar? Where can his behavior come from?

He is neutered, by the way, and gets about 2-3 hours of walks and exercise a day, and afterwards play and running in the yard with the puppy. When left alone, we have a dog walker come for an hour, we give him a frozen stuffed Kong and chew toys.
Whew, thanks for reading this far, looking forward to your tips/advice.

1373035563.0	1hoxzo	Adopted shelter dog, now getting a little out of control. Please HELP! : (	CatInTheAli	19	7	35	"Ok guys, I do not even know where to begin.... 

I guess I should be the first to admit, I probably haven't exactly been the best dog mom (nor has my absent roommate). I am now realizing that I have not put in enough time with our little Punky, and that is OUR fault. Part of the reason is because I just don't know what to do with him, so I am hoping that some of you may be able to offer some advice.

My roommate and I adopted Punky, the Boston Terrier last summer from the local shelter. He is going to be 8 next month. Supposedly he was a ""show"" dog. Not sure how long, and I don't know exactly what kind of training show dogs get, but sometimes I think that maybe he was a failed show dog. His mannerisms are a bit odd. He doesn't really know typical commands, and we have taught him some things (like sit, and wait -- for when we feed him). He is also crate trained and does not have a problem being in his house. He goes right into when I ask him to, and sometimes I'll find him just chilling in his house sleeping or chewing on somethings, so I know he is comfortable with it.

There is also another dog living with us (the other roommates dog). They get along well, as she is a small dog (Yorkie). He did try humping her a lot when they first moved in (I stopped that as much as I could....I know it is just a dominance thing) He has stopped this behavior. Punky is ok with other small dogs, but I have noticed that he is slightly aggressive with larger dogs (maybe because he has to prove himself?)

The big problems that I have since found are :

# 1 : MARKING and PISSING on things.  --- Last night, I came home and the other roommate informed my boyfriend who was sitting next to me on the couch that he was ""sitting in piss"". I don't know if she attempted to clean it or what. So that's just great. Today, I took all the cushion covers off and washed them, and am leaving the cushions outside in the sun to hopefully help with the smell  : ( probably will need a new couch eventually.

#2:  OBSESSIVE LICKING --- its like he thinks that I am a giant salty meat stick. Maybe this is something that he is OCD about and I just have to live with, but UGH. I do stop him when he starts.

#3 :  OVERALL OBEDIENCE --- I don't think he sees me, or his other owner as the alpha dog. I try, but I just don't know how to make him *know* he is MY bitch, and not the other way around (lol) Honestly, my whole life, no one has taken me seriously, why should a 15 lb dog? *sigh*

Like I said, I do feel like I am partially to blame as I have not been contributing to helping him become a better dog. When my roommate and I got him, it was partially for her, because she was going through a rough time and really wanted a pet to help her (you know, animal therapy) I was ok with this, knowing that she would be finding a new job soon (she had been laid off). She is a flight attendant and is based in NYC so she isn't around a lot right now, but in the future she will be home more (she now has more predictable schedule). We are also both in our early 30's

I am definitely going to have a sit down with her about what we need to do. Any training we give him needs to be consistent and I don't think she understands that. I work with him a little when he is gone, and she comes home and thinks that she can just do what *she* wants with him. She thinks he listens to her, and he really doesn't. 

I just need ideas on an approach for this -- dog training classes is def on the list, but I just would like some tips for home training and getting him to stop with this pissing contest.

Most of the info I found was on the road to becoming a dog trainer (certifications and stuff). I want to know about actually working as one.

So I'm a fairly timid person. I've never really envisioned my future as owning my own business or anything like that. I've pretty much always wanted to work *for* someone. Mainly because I have no interest in business and know next to nothing about how to run one. 

I've been kinda toying around the idea of becoming a dog trainer for quite a while now and have been mainly blowing it off because I don't know a lot about training dogs.. yet. (I have a major interest in it, though. I also want to (eventually when I have the space, time, and money) breed Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.) I think in the last week I've finally realized- ""Hm, I don't have to be an expert before I even get started in the field. I can learn about it first. Duh."" No brainer to most people. 

Anyway, I'm pretty sure I want to be a dog trainer. I've been snooping around the Karen Pryor Academy website and I think that will be what I go with. (The foundations course, then the professional one) (I'm looking to start that in the next few weeks, or once I'm more financially stable.)

So, are there other options for me as a dog trainer but not owning my own business? Like being employed for someone that's not petsmart or petco? Or am I just being silly and should just start my own business? There is pretty much nothing in my area for dog trainers aside from petsmart, but I don't know if there's a high demand for trainers here either. 

Maybe I should take a business class at my local college? Is it plausible for me to hire someone to do all the business-y stuff or is that just silly?

Any ideas/advice would be helpful.

Edit: I'm 21 years old, The CKCS comment was really offhand and just something I want to do when I retire *to improve the health of the breed*, and I know I need experience and training before I become a dog trainer. There are already lots of other posts about how to get experience, and no posts that I could find on what I'm asking: which is just what other options would there be for me if I didn't own my own business."	t5_2r067	True

Everything was going fine with his training up until late February. I was home alone with him hanging out watching TV in bed when he stood up and started peeing on the bed. I got up as calmly as I could and started to go towards our back door, calling for him to come so he could go in the right place and he freaked out. Like, complete meltdown; ran into the corner and just lost all bowel control and shrieking like mad. I couldn't get near him without him screaming bloody murder. Luckily my wife came home shortly thereafter and he seemed to calm down.

However, ever since then, he doesn't like being alone with me. If I'm home with him and my wife leaves, he whines by the door until she comes back. If I go to pet him or even walk near him (even if I'm not looking at him or paying him any attention), he urinates. If I call him he runs to another room or to his crate. When I take him outside he runs from me. He ran all the way across the street to urinate in our neighbors yard just now because I had the poor judgment to take him outside off his leash. And naturally when I chased after him and put the leash on him, he yelped and did the whole submissive terrified for his life thing again.

I'm at my wits end, man. I've tried being the one to give him his food regularly so he knows I'm an okay guy. He seems to appreciate the fact that I can feed him, but not much else.

1371231977.0	1gcn9n	Question about behavior...	1936TriggerToe	15	1	4	"BACKROUND: I adopted my second dog, [Bix](http://imgur.com/me7F5s1), about four months ago from my local shelter. On the way home from the shelter he was panting, choking, and whining in the car because he was so nervous. I had to pull over and just pet and hold the little guy because he was loosin it. The first two weeks he was with us, he whined constantly. I mean CONSTANTLY. As time went on his nervousness seemed to take the form of aggression. I was aware that he obviously likes to be a vocal little guy, but his barking took on a whole new intensity. He would bark at every single thing that he saw out the window (his favorite pastime). After a while I instituted a cage. Every time he barks he knows he ought to head to the cage because I will tell him to go there. But when another dog comes around…its like I don’t exist. Thank goodness he only weighs 11lbs. We started taking training classes, working on basic behavior and socializing (which entails Bix barking ferociously at every dog thats bigger than he is). Honestly, he is the smartest dog I've ever had, and really wants to please us. He learns new tricks in 5 minutes and follows every command when he is calm. But when he gets excited, its like he is possessed. 

I began to notice that when he was really excited (example: group of dogs walks by the house, he barks and gets caged. After they’ve walked away from the house I let him out) he will go the whatever window he can still maybe see them out of and begin licking the window and panting really hard. He salivates EVERYWHERE and will do this until he has tired himself out… I noticed he does this in the car as well. At first I thought he hated car rides, because of the crazy licking/gumming behavior, but every time I ask him about a car ride he wags his tail…

So, I’m wondering if I should allow him to continue licking the windows like this…am I validating his behavior by allowing it to go on? Or is it completely harmless? I know that horses often nibble on things to comfort themselves, but this seems to get him more riled up. If he is comforting himself and I punish him for it, will that send him mixed signals? Any thoughts are welcome. Sorry for the length. Just tryin to make my little guy happy.

All I can seem to find is generic introduction tips/that sort of thing - and we're past that point!

I have a four year old male cat, super laid back and friendly. I adopted a 10 (?approx?) month old male Australian shepherd mix three weeks ago. He is laid back and friendly as well, though full of energy. They hit it off right away, or so I thought - turns out puppy had a respiratory infection, so his energy was way down. They cuddled and played, but now that puppy is back to what I'm guessing is his normal high energy level, it seems to be a bit much for the cat.

As a first time dog owner, I'm not even sure if these behaviors should concern me, or it's just the adjustment period. But here's the behaviors that concern me: the dog paws at the cat, licks the cat's genitals a LOT, and play bites the cat. The cat generally tolerates it for a short time, then will run off. The only playing the cat does with the dog now is hiding under things and jumping out to swat at him. The cat doesn't seem angry or scared-more annoyed, and even enjoys being licked (in the non-naughty areas) by the dog. The cat is a rough player himself (he wears soft paws though), and tries to initiate play occasionally, but seems to be turned off by puppy's roughness. 

The dog isn't trained at all - he spent his whole life in a shelter - so we are just working on sit, down, and leave it, at the moment. He is signed up for obedience classes but they don't start until next month. I currently crate the dog while I'm away at work etc, although I'd eventually like to let him have the run of the house - which will not be possible unless I'm certain the cat will be safe.

I'm open to anything and everything, I just want to get a handle on this before it could become a real issue!

I share a duplex with a rather immature and obnoxious individual. We have complained about him multiple times. As a result of this and other things he is being evicted within the next month or two. He has a dog. I have witnessed this dog defecating in his house due to not being let out. She has gotten into our hallway unbeknownst to him and surprised us as we take our dog out. Crap like this, I know she has been neglected to some degree. My dog and her seem to really like each other. My dog is fear aggressive and does not like a lot of people and creatures. I was glad he liked our neighbors dog.

Now, he has either contacted or been contacted by a local small rescue group. He is relinquishing the dog as he is moving, etc. and knows he can't keep up with her. I know the rescue owner and reached out in case they needed any help. They need a foster home. I said I would consider it, given she can get UTD on shots, flea medications, etc. And as long as my dog hasn't had a change of heart and now doesn't like her. Nothing is in stone, and I don't even know if I should foster a neighbors dog as long as he is still right there. They are going to ask him his opinions on that and other foster scenarios to get a feel for his reactions.

Am I being too nice? Should I offer to foster this dog if her health checks out? I have crates and plan on keeping them separate during feeding, any time we are not home, etc. I will also probably implement the two week shut down. Continue with my dogs routine as normal and take her out, etc. separately.

My dog is selective aggressive. He picks and chooses what he has issues with, almost at random. One dog he'll like, another dog not so much. Violently not so much. Same with people, objects, and other types of animals. I could understand if it was different situations and scenarios, but a lot of the times its not. For example dude a. walking down the street hes okay with, 2 seconds later, same sidewalk, same everything, but he has a reaction to dude b. I've had him since he was 8 weeks old, often people will ask when he reacts to things such as bikes, large boxes, different raced people, men, women, lawn gnomes, you name it- if he's had incidents, or situations in the past that would warrant it? But he hasnt, hes had a damn good life and upbringing: i just dont get it. Also its important to note that otherwise he is a well trained dog, happy, and healthy. How do i train, or what steps can i take, to correct behavior that is random, and at best unpredictable in nature?	t5_2r067	True

My pit bull-mix, Lucy, has been with me for a little over a year now.  We've posted here in the past in regards to a lot of issues she had when I first got her.  Those issues are not at all related to this post though.

Yesterday my boyfriend and I took Lucy to Petsmart to pick up some animal chow, a new Kong toy, and some other odds and ends.  She's always very well behaved at Petsmart.  When she sees other dogs she stays to our side and just sort of watches everything go by with a smile.  She doesn't initiate interaction with dogs here that I've seen.

Yesterday they were having one of their training sessions.  An employee who had a large mastiff-type dog was working alongside a lady with a bichon frise.  Lucy and I were watching them from a distance and everything was fine.  Then they began to approach us and the employee asked if my dog was good with other dogs.  I told him the truth...it honestly depends from dog to dog.  At this point both of the dogs had been sitting politely.  His dog stood up and walked towards my dog.  Lucy didn't freeze up, or stare, but the hair on her back went up and she backed away a few steps then woofed.  I should note that the bark was low, no growl, and only a single bark.

The employee told me that my dog was displaying bad tendencies and that what I should do is spin my dogs body around so her butt and back are facing his dog and hold her head so she can't turn around and look at the other dog.  This...of course...didn't help at all.  It took her from being mildly concerned and nervous to VERY stressed out and scared about the whole situation.  I humored him and did it once, then decided it wasn't worth it to stress her out and we just continued on our way.

I know that what he told me was wrong, however, after I was actually feeling a bit sad that she responded that way to begin with.  Some dogs she likes, some she doesn't.  I don't know what I can really do about the ones that immediately make her hair stand up.  Since she doesn't put on a show of actually lunging or snapping at these dogs should I even see it as a problem?

Also, I figure it's relevant to mention, she had dog friends since I got her.  Dog friends meaning dogs that she would get to play and run around with regularly.  We moved about four months ago and I have not found her any new dog friends...so she hasn't gotten full interaction with other dogs for a while."	t5_2r067	True

Our dogs had met a couple times at the park before we began seeing each other, and they got along wonderfully. They are around the same size. Mine is a Siberian husky and she is only a little larger than his who is a German shepherd mix. He is 9 months and mine is 1 year. 

They always play rough at the park, but they never have any problems. They'll wrestle, grab each others scruff, and run around. No fights ever escalate. However, at his apartment, they continuously get into small scuffles and they won't relax when it is time for bed. Both our dogs sleep in crates at home, so he will put his dog in the crate and mine will just stay in the bedroom with us because she's trustworthy enough not to chew anything up or have an accident. The problem is that she will constantly stand by the bathroom door where he sleeps, which will cause him to whine and bark... all night.

So far, we haven't done much training with both of them together. They each know their basic commands. We've worked on ""leave it"" when they start to fight, and giving treats and praise when they ignore each other. We've been having to break up fights every 5 minutes when they are together in the apartment and it's getting extremely frustrating. 

What are our possible options? I have no clue where to start with the bed time problem. My theory as to why they were fighting in the apartment was that they were getting jealous of each other because they are both ""only children"" or they were sick of each other since we've been spending a lot of time together over the past week. I am unsure if his dog gets enough exercise because he works 9 - 5 during the week, but I guarantee that my dog does. She's always ready to play no matter what though because she is a husky, so it's difficult to tell who's initiating the play/fights. Thoughts?"	t5_2r067	True

Our insane puppy who used to try to murder us on a daily basis has finally settled down thanks to positive dog training. Whenever he's in a situation that makes him uncomfortable we supply him with loads of treats and we don't allow evasive maneuvers to work. He's a dream now and he's truly my best friend, although we're still working with him on his trepadatious nature. 

One problem though is that his secondary caretakers, IE my mother-in-law and her mother insist at we're going to kill the animal on it's current diet. He eats a mixture of Science Diet and Grain Free organic wet food. They think the dog food labels lie and he needs cooked chicken, salmon, as well as veggies, cottage cheese, and small amounts of fruit and refuse to budge on the issue, giving him these items without our permission. I'm stuck giving it to him as well, because drastic changes in diet can upset his stomach, and has. I still disagree with any kind of dairy or fruit being consumed by my dog, and I'd love to know what you all think I should do about this. "	t5_2r067	True

I work from home, and so while I am able to be home with my guy during the day, I do need to get work done and so have to crate him in order to be able to do so. His schedule lately has become pretty routine and looks like the following:

10am-11:30am: wakes up (I feel as though in this aspect I have hit the jackpot because he loooves to sleep in. I have tried to get him out of his crate earlier than this and he just looks at me and goes back to sleep) and out for a pee/poop, then breakfast and training for about 20 minutes, followed by some play.

11:30-12:30/1pm: back in the crate where he will sometimes chew on a toy, but eventually fall back to sleep for an hour or so.

1pm-2:30pm: out for a potty break and then some more play time.

2:30pm-4pm: back in the crate, where again he will chew on a toy and then fall asleep.

4pm-7:30pm: free roam of the house, a walk, playtime, dinner.

7:30/8pm-11pm: back in the crate (this seems to be when he is getting sleepy again), and then out for a pee around 11pm.

3:30am: sometimes out for a pee, although sometimes when I go to let him out at this time, he will open his eyes, look at me like ""yeah right mom"", and go back to sleep. I don't force him out (he's never had an accident in his crate) and will then let him sleep until 10am the next morning where the schedule starts again.

2-3 days a week he goes to daycare where he gets to run around and play with other dogs and puppies, and one day a week he has his obedience class. 

I just feel as though he is perhaps in his crate too long throughout the day? He does seem to be fine going in, and doesn't whine once he is put in, but I sometimes catch myself feeling bad that I am putting him in there, and am wondering if a total of 4-5 hours throughout the day is too long to have him crated?

I've brought him to daycare weekly for his whole life, and he's never had any aggression issues there. My back yard has a wooden fence and two of my neighbors have dogs. Every time my neighbor dogs are in their yard, my dog will get extremely aggressive; run back and forth, growl, his fur stands up on his back, and basically just sees red. He usually has pretty good recall, but he will not respond to anything I say when in this state. I always have to physically remove him from the yard.

A trainer told me to grab him firmly by the snout, tell him ""no"", then drag him into the house. I have been doing this for over a year, and he still has these issues. I've tried spraying him with water (he hates it and runs back inside), putting a muzzle on him (he hates it), put a shock collar on him, but none of these things stop the behavior. I was using a shock collar for months and it sort of helped, but the second he goes outside without it, he returns 100% to the previous behavior.

I'm extremely frustrated and I have no idea what to do. The neighbor dogs do bark back, and they seem to egg each other on.

 My friend gave me her border collie/Australian Shepard mix to watch for a couple of weeks. He's 7 years old, and she recently got him on Craigslist from a family who could no longer keep him.

When we first got him we were at the beach and I was playing with him and he got pissed and bit my face and drew blood. Aside from that and biting my room mates hands when they try to get him out of the kitchen he is an amazing dog. He does everything you tell him to do, is very high energy but knows when to be calm, is great on a leash, and doesn't cross any boundaries set for him.

The reason I think he was abused by a previous owner is because I was drawing and I slapped my ruler down on the table and he was sitting below me but hearing the noise made him run and hide in the corner. I think hitting dogs is wrong and maybe it led him to be more aggressive in some situations?

Just today he ate my friends burger while he was out of the room and my friend came over and said ""no"" in a stern voice. At which point he growled and showed teeth at my friend. My friend tried to say no and pointed close to his face and he bit him again. He doesn't really fully trust anyone in the house but me.

My question is, is there anyway to reinforce this behavior is unacceptable?"	t5_2r067	True

They had her listed as ""PG-13 Skittish"", and I wouldn't call her all that skittish. She's very meek and submissive, though very eager to please and smart as a whip. Her submissive behavior isn't what is causing a problem though, since we're working on building her trust and confidence with us and she's taking right to it.

Random things scare her--not noises, but objects. These seem to change every day. She'll be terrified of something one day and fine with it the next. I suspect this is just because she's getting used to her new home and to us, so the little things, I'm not worried about. She'll get over her terror of the dog-poop-bag-trashcan, since she's constantly exposed to it.

The other day, it was pouring when it was time for our morning walk, so I broke out the umbrella. The sound of the rain on it terrified her briefly, but she got over that after I showed her that it was okay, and we went on our walk. When we came back, however, I went to close the umbrella. NOPE. She FLIPPED OUT and pulled out of her harness (I tightened it afterward), then ran out into the rain and lay in the grass, crawling to me on her belly with some serious reservations. Luckily, she doesn't run from me and so she waited for me to come pick her soaking wet ass up and carry her into the house.

I have a few questions. 

1.) Is this just a symptom of a fear stage? Is there anything I can do to help her along during this? 

2.) How can I get her not-afraid of the umbrella, which is huge and makes scary sounds?

Other than her random little fears and her occasional forrays into/near the litter boxes, she is the absolute perfect pup so far, and as her confidence grows, she gets even better! I want her to be confident on rainy walks, so how can I get her used to the umbrella without scarring her forever? We do clicker train.

My fiance and I just recently adopted a dog from the local shelter. She is half Jack Russel and half beagle. She is a very sweet dog, but is deathly afraid of people. I assume she was probably abused before, but as she was just dumped off at the shelter no one really knows. She is especially afraid of me and maybe that is because I am a 6'2"" 290 lb man. I was just wondering if anyone has any hints as to what we can do to help this dog feel at home and be not so afraid of us. She doesn't bite nor bark... She cowers quite a bit if I come close to her.

What scares us more than anything, is that any opportunity the dog gets she runs! I am typing this at 4 in the morning where I live and I just spent the last hour and a half with my fiance catching the dog who ran well over a mile from our house. She slipped out of her collar and just would not come. The dog was just spayed yesterday, so now we are afraid she may have done damage to the healing process. The vet specifically told us that she cannot run for 10 days... We are going to take her to the Vet as soon as they open.

**tl;dr We have a brand new dog that is afraid of everyone and were wondering if there were any tricks to get her over it**

**UPDATE** We have the harness now and Chloe (the dog) has been sleeping all day on my [Comfy Sack](http://www.comfysacks.com/) and I believe that she has decided that is her place in the house... Unfortunately for me that is where I normally sit, but I am more than happy to give it up to make her feel more comfortable. She is also warming up more to my fiance and has even been eating from her hands and following her around. We are a bit worried that she is so tired today, but considering none of us got sleep last night we are not that worried yet. If she continues to sleep all day tomorrow we are taking her to the vet. Today the vet said that she may still be tired today after the tramatic night and as long as she isn't licking the wound (from the spaying) and it looks about the same as it did yesterday she should be okay. I did not add this before, but luckily she doesn't run from us in the apartment and she will eat and drink. + She does not stop us from putting the harness on nor will she stop us from going outside. So at least we have that going for us! She does however get very scared easily outside and will only walk behind us. If we somehow get behind her she does not like it!

Thank you all for the advice and the stories! It really makes us feel more confident that she will grow into a wonderful dog!

1367343608.0	1df955	16 week old is absolutely terrified of loud noises.	TestingTesting_1_2	13	0	7	"**The basics:**

* Name: Dexter
* Age: 16 weeks  
* Breed: German Shepherd Dog + American Staffordshire Terrier
* History: Rescued (with mom and littermates, thankfully) from abandoned house that was being used as a bathroom by our lovely homeless population.
* Problem: fear and reactivity due to loud noises (i.e., unresponsiveness, not aggression)

**The situation:**  
Loud noises, especially when something is moving unpredictably (e.g., box falling over behind him), are very startling to him. I think I've read enough on desensitization and counterconditioning that I can work to train that fear out of him. Something I'm struggling with, though, is how to handle prolonged loud noise.

For instance, when we are outside and someone a few yards over (across the street - I don't have a yard) fires up the lawnmower or a garbage truck idles in the street, Dexter is absolutely terrified, and not in *any* sort of ""aww he's scared, how adorable"" or ""teehee that's funny"" way. We're talking abject *terror*.

He expresses overt ""I'm fucking terrified that I'm going to die right now"" body language and sits (rather politely) facing the apartment, wishing for me to walk him back inside. He is essentially completely unresponsive to verbal cues. If I walk him away from the stimulus, his hormone-fueled sensitivity does not diminish, even after 20+ minutes, and is reinforced by the slightest ""scary"" noise that would not normally bother him very much (e.g., a car driving by). I live in a busy area in a big city, so there is no real ""quiet"" area to take him to in order to ease him back into things.

Since the noise from lawnmowers and weed-wackers is relatively constant, I'm not sure that the ""Look at That"" game would be effective here. I could be wrong, but that seems better-geared toward *sudden* distractors. To boot, working our way up to that level of stimulation would be a huge challenge, making me think there might be a more effective way.

**The current plan:**  
Assuming I can get him willing to be outside while people are doing yard work, the plan is to start by hanging out and playing on my deck with him for a long time, then slowly work our way down to the street with lots of treats, toys, and praise along the way. (If I can't get him outside, we'll start inside with the door open and go from there.)

Does that sound like a reasonable and effective solution? Do you have any suggestions for speeding things along? I'd like to get him comfortable with the city environment as quickly as possible so that he is not terrified. I feel so bad for the little guy!"	t5_2r067	True

I was looking for a trainer for aggression, leash pulling, and assuming I can ever get him to pay attention while outdoors I'd love to get some off-leash control.

My vet recommended [Gigi Moss](http://www.gigimoss.com/) or [Tenderfoot Training](http://www.tenderfoottraining.com/index.html). The website you guys have (zipcode 80302 if you want my search results) recommends the Humane Society nearby as well as Tenderfoot.

When I called Tenderfoot though the guy seemed very nice but also a bit entrenched in his own ways. He referred to food training as bribery a lot which both this sub and APDT warn about. And he wanted to put my dog in an environment with cats nearly right away even though I had said he has severe cat aggression. 


**TLDR**  Basically can someone help me sift through the trainers in my area and find a couple I can call?

Quick list of the things I'm looking for

* Aggression Training

* Leash Pulling

* Off Leash attention

* Really attention in general while outside

He's great with people but if he sees any sort of animal (except birds) while outside he starts whining and trying to run toward them.

But, being as large as he is, he has the obvious potential to knock kids down. Worse, every kid in the universe seems to decide to sprint around the yard when they're at my house which further puts the dog into a frenzy. As a result, we've had to restrain him if kids come over. This causes even more excitement because now he can't run up and sniff, lick, and play like he wants to. Last week he tugged on a kid's shirt before being bopped on his head by my fiance, and he let go.

He also zones out when kids are over. Like all normally obeyed commands just go out the window.

Today I rescued a dog. He is a Scheperke (spelling...) mix. About 8-12 lbs? This isn't my first dog to live with and raise, but it is my first male dog and rescue. 

I have a few questions, though. Steve (his name) is really cool. I picked him up at the rescue and he seemed happy. We went to the store and bought him a crate, bed, toys, food, collar, leash, the works. We brought him home and he knew to use the bathroom outside. Which is awesome. 

But a few odd things: Steve likes to mark. I get it, he is a boy dog, and I make sure to tell him that's not cool. I look him and the eye and sternly say no. Not all super angry, just stern. Is that proper practice on my part? (PS he is getting fixed Tuesday).

Also, Steve doesn't like his crate. It's certainly big enough and comfortable for him but he only went in for a treat (and also ran out as soon as he snatched it up. He's fast). Is there a way I can help him transition? I need to leave him in it for three hours in, one hour out (lunch break) and another three in while I work. Until maybe I can trust him not to chew or destroy things. 

And the biggest one, the one I need the most help with...

Steve LOVES my girlfriend. Which is great. But it's clingy love. Like ""OMG please be near me or hold me."" Is this separation anxiety? What can I do to help this? On top of that, he seems to really distrust males. My friend and I show him affection and love and he will accept it, but sometimes he is really skeptical about it? I guess that's a way to put it. Sometimes when I appear in a room he is wary (not defensive, he hasn't growled or snipped) but just kinda ""I'm sorry I didn't do it I swear"" looking. 

Was Steve abused by a man or abandoned by a woman?

He always has a full dish, and eats whenever.  But recently, whenever he is eating, if you come close, or touch him underneath his stomach, or around his mouth (regardless if he actually has any food in his mouth) he will become aggressive and very stiff.
The odd part is you can touch the food in the bowl, and he is fine.  Even feed it to him by hand, no problem.

He will even still listen to commands in this state, ie, 'shake a paw' but then in the next second he'll snap at that same hand if it 'violates his rules' per say.

It's hard to explain, but when you see it happen it seems he knows that it is wrong, but cannot help it.  Sometimes he will shake uncontrollably after a verbal scolding, or seek affection, yet continue the behavior.  

The behavior will also continue 5-10 minutes after the food/snack is done, and slowly subside.

Does that make sense?  Anyone come across something like this before?

I have a six month old puppy who is house trained but still crated all night and while I'm at work (she gets a one hour break with me at lunchtime).

The owners of the puppy's mother (full pit bull) needed someone to foster her for 1-2 months while they looked for a pit-friendly place and we took her in to foster eagerly. She is beautiful and relatively well-behaved.

The first two days were great, though it was apparent that she did not get to go outside much at her last home. Now, my dog has always stayed within 50ft of our front door, in what I called an ""invisible leash"", and as such, has taught the puppy the same thing. Meaning, I have always been able to leave them outside to go to the bathroom or to play without needing to use leashes and whatnot. Not anymore.
The foster has taken to running off and my dogs will follow her. I will call them before they are out of eye-sight, they will stop and stare at me for a few moments (seems like the foster is trying to see how far I am and if there is any way I can keep her from doing what she wants), then take off in the opposite direction. As a kid, I had dogs that did this and never was able to break them of it.

Because of this, there is no more time outside without a leash. But... is there any way to teach the foster not to do this so that they can once again enjoy the outdoors? And if not, will 1-2 months of leashed and supervised outside visits ruin my forever dogs from being able to go outside without supervision once the foster goes back home (and my bigger fear is that the foster may have to become a long-term foster/forever and then what will I do?)?

At 14 weeks, we decided to finally transition him to outside. He didn't mind going outside, but would hold it for the pads, since he didn't know any better and we trained him to go on the pads. Plus, it's nice and warm inside! So on Friday night, his last day of going potty in our bathroom with the pads, we got a treat bag ready and ordered more poop bags from amazon. Then we completely cleaned up our bathroom floor, then went over it again with Natures Miracle. He woke up Saturday morning and we headed out the door and rang the bells we put on there and say the cue word, potty. He walks around for a minute outside (gave us the ""WTF"" look, haha) and couldn't hold it any longer and goes pee. We gave him a semi high value treat and praised. Afterwards, we took him out every 30min. As with the pads, he would frequently go, since it was convenient. Despite being able to hold it during the night for up to 5 hours, usually 3.5 hours. So as the potty trips went on, we slowly increased to 35min, then 40min, then 45min and now we're doing every 50-60min. After every poo/pee, he got a small piece of treat. If he's occupied with a toy/training, he could hold it past an hour, sometimes an hour and half. No accidents since transitioning, we still keep him on a lead at all times and next to our side, never allowed to roam around freely or out of sight, unless we let him run around for a few min after potty and let him chase us. There's been times when he has started to sniff/circle the carpet, we grab him right away and took'em outside. Eventually we'll slowly start to take the treat away. But for right now, he knows outside potty = treat. And sometimes he likes staying out there for a few minutes to explore. Once he's ready, he pulls towards the front door, to signal he wants to go back inside. 

We're crossing our fingers and hoping he keeps this up! He's been pretty quick during the night trips. Wokeup only once last night, while during the weekend, I had to wakeup twice. 

Before some chime in about the pee-pads. We live in a town home, row style. We have an end unit, so we have a small front lawn and long side lawn. When we got him, it was in single digit temp and the wind would literally knock him off his feet. So we tried outside and pee pads for night or when weather was bad. Then a couple weeks after having him, he got Giardia/Coccidia. So that's when we decided to stop letting him go outside, to prevent spreading it to the neighborhood dogs and possibly contaminating the area outside, where he will be going once he's negative. We were able to catch his poop with tissue and flush down the toilet. Giardia/Coccidia was no fun ride, I'm sure those who have experienced it, know how the stools end up coming out. We jumped in joy/celebration on his last stool test lol. Took about 3 weeks of treatment, between the two. "	t5_2r067	True

1361567656.0	191kji	My new guy is causing 'issues' within our family...	bitchyber	13	0	11	"Whatever tips or advice ANYONE can give would be wonderful...

My family and I (Fiance', 2 Step-Children here a week and at their mothers a week and a 3 year old English Bulldog) decided to rescue/adopt a puppy back in November of last year. His name is [Rowdy](http://i.imgur.com/fbVwY), now a 1 year old Bull Terrier/Jack Russell mix, 35lb, neutered and crate trained red-headed creature that lives up to his name.

A little background: Herky, the Bulldog, is a very gregarious dog. He loves people, he is a typical lazy, chill/relax and watch TV type of dog. We all were aware of the energy level of a terrier and thought it would be great for Herky (he needs to loose a few pounds). 

We wanted a dog to play with Herky because he is so social. Herky went to training but is still very much Bull-headed. But, we got the basics down. 

I have had dogs/animals my entire life and have read/done a lot of training. I used to work with horses and now Intern at a local zoo. I do my research and reading. My fiance' expects my new dog to be a 'Herky' as he likes to say. And trust me, I have explained to him that's not going to happen for a while. He's not a real patient man... take that as you will.

Now to Rowdy, the GOOD: He's a sweetie. He's incredibly smart. He has started to understand the concepts of basic obedience. He sits, lays and shakes for now. We are working on loose leash, stay and come. Come is getting better. His stay is really bad. He seems very ADD, but, I chalk that up to 'puppy'. He has attached himself to me. Likes everyone else but really loves me.

The issues: I have seen a VAST improvement in the walking department but we still have problems. We use a prong collar. I have used these collars on my Rottie (no longer with us) ++SEE NOTE++ and other larger dogs growing up. Now, I know I'm going to get heat for this but it is the ONLY thing that works. He does not do well with the easy leader, the easy walker and a regular harness. Trust me, I've tried them. And bought all of them. He had literally drug me across a football field one time. I tried the standing still, the waiting, the treats/clicker. NOTHING is working. He pulls like a sled dog. He jumps at dogs walking by. He actually jumped towards a dog and flipped over and landed on his back/head really hard the other day. His hair stands up when dogs bark at him or if he sees another dog. However, this doesn't happen at the dog park for some reason. He's very social at the dog park. He gets hump-y but other than that we have a great time there.

HE'S WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS! (Just Kidding, but not really.) This dog is destroying every thing we have and whatever he can get in his mouth. The list includes: the comforter on my bed, an ottoman, various area rugs, PILLOWS, shoes and a chlorinator from our pool (with chlorine in it, didn't eat it, crunched on the tablets though). He's destroyed my landscaping outback, ate a bush completely and enjoys the water from the birdbath on a regular basis.

He has toys, chewies, ropes rawhide's, balls and of course, my other dog to play with. Its almost like a game. He stops when we either: A) squirt him with a squirt bottle B) Yell C) command 'drop it'/'leave it' (which works wonders now).

Family: My family is very upset with things getting chewed on. My house is a MESS ALL THE TIME! We do put stuff up but he finds a way. My fiance gave me the 'its me or the dog' speech. I talked him into another 60-90 days so I'm kind-of desperate. Its not that I'd choose the dog or anything but I think he deserves a chance. He can be a good dog, we just need to teach him. That's my normal speech to the family.

He's on Heartguard and he gets 3 Zyrtec for allergies in the AM and PM. It usually helps with the hyper-ness (unintentional, I promise!)

I want to help him and I want to be better for him but I'm loosing my mind. I don't think we were ready for this... BIG regrets. I know its probably us. I know I'm doing something really wrong. Or we are.

I had been on another forum and got my butt chewed for the prong collar so I've ordered a martingale collar. I've also ordered a 30ft lounge rope, flirt stick (my fiance is making it) and a easy leader muzzle harness. We have a 'Behaviorist' coming out on Saturday (tomorrow) to see if its something he could help figure out.

Sorry for rambling... I'm distraught. I didn't rescue him for nothing. I don't want to give up but I don't want to loose my family because of a dog.

1361474241.0	18yxu2	Snappy dog problem	dragonfox	14	1	8	"Hello All,

I love my dog, posted here plenty of times, had him for a year now, he's 2 years old.  I sometimes have a problem with Draco, who is a 60 lb lab mix. Two things:

1. When Draco is laying down and comfortable, like on the bed or couch, and I need him to move, I have to move him.  He will sneer at me and snap at my hands when I go to physically move him.  This happens very rarely, like once a month if that.  But I've also learned if I talk nicely to him and warm him up first with ""Oh, Draco, my good boy, blah blah"" and pet him, he's less likely to snap.  But I feel lie this is....bribing him not to snap at me, I hate feeling like I have to please my dog so he won't get angry at me - that's not right!  When he does snap at me, I push him off the bed or couch (not aggressively, but assertively).  And if he snaps at me, it is threatening and I don't doubt if I didn't pull my hand back that he would bite it (not enough to break skin, but enough to piss me off).  

How should I prevent this and how should I respond when it does happen?  

2. I want to know what you all think of this: Draco has gotten worse about resource guarding (why the change, I have no clue - nothing has changed, but I plan on working on this with him now).  I foster dogs.  The scenario the other day was I forgot to pick up his Kong Wobble after he ate.  I let the foster dog in the living room (where the kong was - with no food left in it I learned).  The foster dog was no where near the kong when Draco lunged after him, snapping away - without warning.  I grabbed Draco to get him off the foster dog and Draco bites my hand/wrist (not breaking any skin at all, but it did leave faint bruises on me).  And I did yell to try to stop him (edit, stop him from attacking the dog, not from biting me), which looking back, I should be more calm if this happens again.  When he was biting me, he was in like crazy dog mode and that day he had a lot of pent up energy since I've been too busy lately to get his energy out.

Part of me knows it's unacceptable for Draco to ever bite me (but he does when we are playing, same degree that he bit me when i grabbed him) and part of me feels that I shouldn't be upset at him biting me when I grabbed his collar and pulled him away. 

So, what do you think of this situation?  Is 1 and 2 related?  Should I *never* allow him to bite me (edit - put his mouth on me period), even if we're playing (the advice I would give to me)?  How should I respond if this happens again? 

I don't think I need to see a behavioralist, but if the overwhelming recommendation is that I should, then it's something I will consider.  He's a very trainable dog, very confident, high energy, and just intense with everything he does.  I think this is something I could fix on my own if I were to better understand the situation and how *I* should react.  I want to nip this is the bud and not let his bad behaviors worsen.  

Thank you and I did not intend for this to be so long!

1361411645.0	18xcqh	Advice for me and my dog - She is obsessed with playing with other dogs	eastwood88	13	2	9	"Hi r/Dogtraining! 

I'm looking for help with my dog Charlie. She's about 1 1/2 years-old, Rottweiler/Doberman X. I've had her for about 4 months now and she is obsessive about playing and chasing dogs in the dog park. There's no snapping her out of it (unless I catch her), she won't come when called, and even won't come if I start walking away. I can tell by her body language it is an anxious-excited energy that's being displayed. 

She'll be playing fine with certain dogs, where there is a back and forth play attitude between them, then there will be another where she constantly tries to seek their attention. Nips their neck, barks (she never barks), bounds/pounces in front of them etc. I would say almost all the dogs she displays this behavior towards aren't interested in her whatsoever. They don't want to play after saying hello. Interestingly enough 75% of these 'non-interested dogs,' seem quite focused on playing fetch/retrieving, the other 25% are just plain not interested. These dogs will usually growl and snap back, but it never leads to a fight. It's like she's teasing them into play, and won't let it go...

I realize she is in her adolescence phase of life, and she acts like it other times. But this energy is different, it's too obsessive, and I feel like one day it will lead to a fight... 

I really want to break her of this behavior, so she knows when to leave dogs alone. Is it just time? Any proper training techniques?  

Any advice and help is much appreciated Reddit! 

EDIT: Thanks for all the help and replies I will be trying the various techniques you've all recommended!"	t5_2r067	True

1360789555.0	18guvs	3 Dogs ages 4,5,6; House trained till moved into new house...	needdoghelpz	15	3	5	"...1 year ago.  They have now since destroyed the carpet.  Completely forgot all their training.  The biggest problem is that we do not see them ""go."" They know they are not supposed to do it inside and we never ketch them, no idea who does what.  The worst part is we will leave the door open all day and will look and see poop and pee right inside of the OPEN door.  As if they REFUSE to ""go"" outside.  I have come home and sat outside with them for over an hour while they scamp around the yard. Only moving inside when they are all 3 frantically scratching to come in.  Assuming this means they are ""done"" we then go inside.  In the time it takes to pee myself, I will come out and see poo right in front of the open outside door, or wherever else they felt.  Right after we just came in.  Like they were frantically scratching because they had to poop so bad and they are too good for grass.  No way to know who has done what.  We crate all day while we are gone.  We are going to start at night because we lock them in our room but the floor is destroyed.  Several times they go in their crate.  They share 2 latched together, they are about 9-10 lb. each.  Combo Crate is large enough for 4 beds their size but only have 3.  ""Someone"" poo/pee's in the small one spot without a bed.  This happens like 2x a month.  I feel it is because they don't go in the morning when they are put outside for about 1/2 hour then go straight to the crate.  We don't want to get rid of them, but are in the process of getting ready to add new flooring and I don't want to just spend $1000s for them to just destroy it again.  I see where there is help here but I have found nothing on what to do with 3 dogs.  I don't know if they are all messing up or just one or two.  We suspect 2.  Again, hard to tell. though the 3rd we see go outside regularly (but not all the time).  When we do ketch them we yell a lot, and regularly bring all 3 in to watch us yell at the poo (saw it on a training show) and then put it outside.  Almost never see the pee until it has dried and see the satin or ""white residue"".  Dogs don't care and continue to have ""mistakes.""  


What we would really like to know is how to proceed.  Do we basically crate like 20 hours out of the day? In segments of course.  But like Overnight, 30 min in the morning, 9-10 hours all day, leave outside for 2-3 hours, then back in the crate till like night, then 30 min break, then back in the crate overnight? 


Thanks for reading!


TL;DR Dogs REFUSE to ""go"" outside.  3 of them make it difficult to know who and they virtually NEVER get caught.


EDIT: Some side notes: we have found pee everywhere from corners of furniture all the way to just in the middle of the kitchen.  Like they just pee where they feel like it.  They love their create and often go lie in it whenever for whatever."	t5_2r067	True
1360705059.0	18egmq	2 Q's: 1)Is the boxer I found a previous fighting dog? (old scars and found wounded) 2)How can I treat his separation anxiety?(destroyed my room last night and found his way onto the roof this morning). PLEASE!	WalktheRubicon	15	2	10	"Hi, so my first question is 1)Can anyone tell whether this dog was a past fighting dog or if he was just abused or living on the streets or what?

The background info:
This boxer(I've decided to name him Cassius) was found near the University of California, Riverside. He was taken to the vet and had a deep cut (http://imgur.com/BPIeXRz) on his inner thigh and another on his leg(http://imgur.com/OS1hZz0), as you can see from the pictures they both required stitching. He has a lot scars that have healed(http://imgur.com/R1zaPzy) and on the edges of his ears, there are a couple rips that have healed and scarred. The vet said he is around 1.5 years old and could have been a fighting dog. I guess it makes sense because of the scars but what confuses me is that so far this boy has been very obedient and whenever I say no he stops whatever he's doing. He's been around a beagle, 2 chihuahuas and another small dog with no problems at all. One of the chihuahuas actually bit him in the face and he didn't even do anything. Since Sunday night, I've been taking care of him in a new house which also has a 8month golden retriever, named Marley. There haven't been any serious incidents yet but my boxer does growl when Marley gets too close. He kinda bark/snapped at Marley as he ran past him on the stairs the other day but whenever this or the growling happened I tell him no and kinda divert his attention towards me, which so far has been working out pretty well. My friend said sometimes these dogs can be calm and just very well trained to fight on cue(which kinda scares me cause what if i accidentally give him the cue?).

Question 2) How do I train him to be more comfortable with me not around?

I've taken in Cassius since Sunday night so only about 3 days now.
Last night I left him in my room alone for 3 hours and he completely destroyed my room. My light was knocked over and shattered, trash can emptied out, and every single blind ripped off along with the frames. He absolutely will not allow me to leave his sight when I'm home unless I sneak away while he's sleeping. This morning I had to leave for a couple hours and left him to roam around the house(Marley was caged). Just as I was pulling out of the driveway I see him burst out of my upstairs window (the actual window was open and it was only the screen in the way. in hindsight I should have know to close the window cause of the pawprints left on the window from the night he trashed my room.) and proceed to run up and out of my sight. Long story short, after some tag I managed to get him back into the window and closed the window. I put him in a housemate's room for the time I'm gone and he said that Cassius was whining the whole time until he was let on the bed and fell asleep. I guess what I really want to know is how to keep him calm while I'm gone instead of going berserk? I've been reading that boxers don't like confinement so I was thinking of sectioning off a section of the house for him. 

TL;DR - 2 Questions 
Found a Boxer with old scars and 2 cuts that needed stitching (pictures above). So far seems pretty calm around people &amp; little dogs. Gets a bit alpha around our 8month golden retriever but stops as soon as we say no). 1) Can anyone tell if he's a fighting dog? 

Left him alone twice since I've been with him. first time he destroyed my room. second time he pushed out the screen on the window and was running around on the roof..2) How do I keep him from going nuts when I'm gone? I'm thinking of sectioning off a portion of the house for him but how do I deal with the separation anxiety?

It only happens when she is whining for attention.

She just started a new medication, hydroxyzine (similar to benedry), since she was scratching her head and hindend. I'm guessing it could be the source since the contorsion reminds of the motion a dog does to bite its tail, but it's weird nonetheless.

1359955467.0	17uod5	My dog hates anything with balls		13	2	1	"So we adopted a 3.5 y/o lab mix, Lando, in December. He'd apparently come from an abusive home. His foster dad warned us that he would sometimes bark at strange men, and that is something we have been very successful in curbing through positive reinforcement (setting up 'random' meetings with 'strange' men who all happen to have tons of pieces of hotdogs). We are to the point with him where he may bark at a new man approaching, but if the guy says hello to him and offers him pets, he's a mush in seconds. 


The problem I am having is with unaltered male dogs. I try to take him and our other dog to the park 3x a week because, although we have a nice big fenced yard, they both really enjoy the interaction. None of the parks around here ban unaltered males. Lando basically tries to mess with every unaltered male he meets. He stands over them, tail razor straight up, body really stiff, and if they move he growls and basically herds them. Lando doesn't do this to fixed males or female dogs. He doesn't outright fight or bite them, but some of the dogs don't take kindly to his antics and sometimes he will just get obsessed with cornering one dog. If the dog doesn't nip back or try to run, Lando doesn't do anything. He will just corner the dog until I call him off.  I normally am a ""let dogs work it out"" type, but obviously not all owners are comfortable with that and I don't expect them to be. Also, I don't know if the unaltered dog is dog aggressive or not, and I'd rather assume that every dog could hurt mine. 

So far I have worked on managing it so I can take him to the park still. Right now, thiis is what I am doing:

1- developing a strong recall. Every time i call him to come to me, he gets piles of treats. This has worked really well, and when I call him off, he does listen. I sometimes have to repeat myself and call him to me, but he will reluctantly leave that dog alone. 

2- developing a ""leave it"". I am working at home with his toys, treats and playtime with our other dog on a leave it command. This has also worked thus far in practice - if i notice him zero in on a dog i will tell him to leave it and he will usually listen. I usually have to catch him in the moment before he launches into ""attack dog"" mode though. 

3- redirect. I keep a frizbee or tug rope with me and try to make it super interesting. This works about 50% of the time. 

I guess I am looking for advice. Unlike with men, i can't figure out how to make unaltered males = good things. Should I try to find someone with an unaltered dog and work on it through classical conditioning? 

Any other things or techniques I should consider for either making him react more positively to unaltered dogs, or at least leave them alone? Is it better to just keep him home? (I'd really hate to have to do that)

It's worth noting that he was only snipped maybe a year ago and I don't know much about his life before that. He sat at the rescue in a cage for over a year before his foster dad took him, and we got him about a month after that. I joke he's trying to get his balls back :/"	t5_2r067	True
1359567837.0	17kl6x	Is my puppy playing too rough?	badcree	16	4	9	"I just brought my new 12-week-old corgi puppy home, and I love her! She's almost completely housebroken, loves to be cuddled and petted, and doesn't bark more than the average puppy. I've had her for three days now, so it might be a little early to start worrying about her future, but I figure it's never too early to start breaking bad habits.

I noticed at the breeder's that she was very aggressive towards her litter-mates. She's always on the offensive when she meets other dogs (she's met two since she's come home with me.) She always wants to attack them and pick fights, and while she's usually very friendly with humans, she sometimes gets so involved with play-fighting that she'll forget whom she's attacking and turn on humans who try to pull her away or pick her up.

She met my boyfriend's dog when she came home--he's a seventy pound german shepherd mix, so she can't boss him around like she could her sisters. Still, she likes to play with him and bite his face, and he humors her by playing along and being gentle with her. He could bite her in half if he felt like it, so I know he doesn't mind her playing with him, but sometimes when she starts acting a little too vicious, I'll pull her away to scold her and she'll start biting me. She'll nip my face or my hands or whatever she can get at, and then she whines and struggles (and bites) until I let her go again. I don't want her to think that when she can't bite a dog, she can bite a human instead, but I'm afraid that if I start petting her or giving her a toy to calm her down, she'll associate nipping with a reward.

Should I discourage my puppy from playing with other dogs if she can't take a time-out when I say she needs one? How should I scold her when she starts nipping me? Will she just grow out of this nipping phase as she gets older? "	t5_2r067	True

He follows me from room to room, every step I take. He even comes into the shower while I'm bathing to make sure I'm still there. The minute I sit down, he is right on me. He likes to lay on the back of the couch and put his head on my shoulder.

There was ample room on both sides of the heater to bypass it, but despite all my efforts, he would not brave up and walk past it. He would look at me and display obvious will to come on command, but fear of the roaring heat-breathing beast between us would not be over come. In most other scenarios, his recalls are strong. But in the face of danger, it's always better to play it safe than to obey the recall. 
I just wonder, if he was in the situation of the dog in Dante's peak where it has to jump over the flaming river of lava into the back of the truck, would Mac be brave enough to do it? Or would he, much as I hate to say it, succumb to the lava? I feel like this is important. 

My first thought is that his recalls do just need to be better. And that he understands the requirement of recalling on command. 

However, and perhaps i'm just being anthropomorphic, he really reacted like a pussy. And yeah, i'm a human and all, but the heater between us wasn't THAT scary. Now, I am not claiming that his fears are irrational, so to speak, as he finds vacuum cleaners just as frightening as the next dog. But how can I teach him to be at peace with the vacuum cleaner. 
How can I teach him to be brave in the face of the vacuum cleaner. 
How can I teach him to walk around the heater.
How can I teach him to jump the lava?

1354811862.0	14e1af	Benefits of obedience class?	caldridge1	16	3	20	"Hi guys,

I've got a six month old GSD.  He is awesome!  I have been training him at home since day one, and he has been attending puppy classes since he was about twelve weeks old.

Recently, obedience classes have become a bit of a chore and I'm thinking of dropping them.  We are on our third trainer (we haven't been getting kicked out - we have just found better trainers each time), and have been attending her classes for about a month now.  Even though I think she's a great trainer, her classes are *really* laid back and easy going.  Unfortunately, both me and my dog are quite impatient, and get bored easily.  The dog seems to start acting frustrated as soon as we get there, and stresses out for most of the class when he's not ""working"".  Also, he seems to be obsessed with sniffing around the hall that the class is in, and it's very difficult to hold his attention, which seriously frustrates and embarrasses me.  I'm getting a bit sick of saying ""honestly, he knows how to heel"".  Overall, it just seems like a bit of a painful experience for the both of us.

Here's my dilemma:  Despite the fact that obedience class is ""for his own good"", is it actually?  I mean, if neither of us enjoy it, is there any point in going?

I feel like I've done a good job of training him at home.  I've always clicker trained him and he's a very quick learner.  Obviously, it's a learning curve for both of us, and sometimes we get stuck.  This is where having a friendly trainer at obedience class is really handy.  I also feel that socialising him is important, but given that he has been socialised since he was about nine weeks old, and been going to class for four/five months I'm not sure that socialising him formally every week is that important anymore.  We meet other dogs every single day on walks, and we have a dog walker that walks him with another dog for an hour, twice per week.

**I feel like I'm babbling on a bit here.  So, here's the TL;DR version:**

**I want to remove my dog from obedience class and continue training him at home, as I always have done, but I am worried that it might have a negative impact on his personality/training etc.  Thoughts?**

I should also add that although I feel the training is going really well, we still have a couple of issues with him:  Barking at other dogs that he meets (excitedly, not aggressively - although the owners usually look terrified!), and him eating his own poo.  I'm not sure that either of these can be addressed by going to puppy class (although we are trying to address both problems ourselves, with little success so far)."	t5_2r067	True
1354809123.0	14dypx	Is it safe to keep a 5 month old IG puppy in an exercise pen while away at work?	sarahhlove	14	3	30	"I have a 9 week old Italian Greyhound puppy who I currently keep in a crate while I am at work. I am currently able to go home at lunch to let him out to pee, play, etc. but in February, I will be moving farther from my work, meaning he'd be locked up all day.

As he will only be approx. 5 months old in February, he still won't be able to make it more than 6 hours without peeing, so I was thinking of keeping him in an exercise pen with a puppy pad, some toys and a bed so he can play and relax. 

My only concern is that he might climb or injure himself while we're gone. (Italian Greyhounds are very prone to leg breaks as puppies)

While waiting to get the paperwork for her, I was seated next to a kennel that contained her 8-month old puppy.  He was the last one left of the litter that she was picked up with last Summer, and he kept sticking his paw out to scratch her ear.  I asked to see him too, and it became clear that I would do well to take them both.  Here's a picture:

http://imgur.com/DY6KK

They are still great, and I love them both, but they were not walked or trained, since they had a yard.  Subsequently, I have been somewhat frustrated trying to walk them together while also promoting loose-leash.  I have decided to walk and clicker-train them separate.  I've read quite a bit about strategies, so I try to make the training fun for both.

The problem is that when I try to walk him outside, I provide click-treat incentives to keep moving, but we have never gotten more than 30 feet from my door, because he will sort of shut down, tail between legs, crouching to the ground after a while until I change direction back towards my apartment (and his mother).  He also won't play with me/toys much and will keep coming back to try to rough-house with his mother while I'm petting her.  She doesn't have the energy he does, so if he only plays with her, he ends up with a lot of bottled up energy.

I'm planning on continuing to train them separate, and I know it will take time, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips on dealing with that kind of separation anxiety during the training process.  It's better since I've gotten them separate kennels, but I really don't want him to see training as a negative thing (being taken from his mother)

TL;DR: Adopted mother/son pair, son won't walk/play without her, and I want to train them both."	t5_2r067	True

We got her from a lady who sold Goldens and two other breeds. I do not know why but this did not set off any alarms until months down the road. We realized that she did not have the parents and reading over e-mails she said she would be picking up a new litter before we got our dog.

We just got her fixed and the Vet told us she only had one ovary and it was because of her breeding. This set off another alarm for us.

She also has major issues with most everything outside. A trash can scared the crap out of her just standing there. If the wind blows and grass touches her she freaks out. I can stand next to the object being calm, trying to inspect it with her but she will not look at me. I could have a t-bone in my hand and she will ignore it, she even ignores her name.

I think she may have mental issues and because of her breeding. I am at my wits end. She does good inside the house besides being scared of any sudden noises or movements.

The instructors have the dog searching for food for several months before transitioning to birch. As part of the food training, they reward at/on the target. 

When do you typically transition to the odor? I can't see 3-4 months as a reasonable wait time. For the minimal tracking training I did, we always removed the drops as soon as possible. 

As a clickers-are-stupid trainer who turned into omg-this-little-piece-of-plastic-is-magical trainer, I can't help but see an immediate use for a clicker. Why not click when the dog indicates the scent? One of the people in the class said that you can't accurately identify what the dog is sniffing or thinking when it hits the target, so you might not be clicking the correct behavior.

Perhaps it is my naughty pride shining through, but my first reaction was, ""Well maybe *you* can't, but *I* can!""   I was able to clicker-train my very, very soft rescue to do scent discrimination articles for Utility. Every other method, regardless of how happy and positive it was, was simply too much pressure for her. The clicker made it crystal clear exactly *what* she needed to do (sniff!).

I have a 2 year old (on Dec 1) retriever mix who was VERY easily trainable as a puppy, and VERY food motivated. She got the basics down simply and easily, knows a few tricks, has great house manners, etc.

Lately I've had some free time, and she's seemed bored, so I've been trying to get in short (10-15 minute) training sessions just to make things more fun for her. However, she suddenly doesn't seem to grasp anything. I've always taught via the luring method with a clicker/positive word, and shaping the behavior until its at a finished product. As a puppy, she picked this up great and learned some advanced tricks quickly.

Now she doesn't seem interested in the lure method AT ALL. I've tried her food, high reward foods (boiled chicken, jerky treats, really smelly stuff), tried her favorite toys, etc. And she has ZERO interest. She checks out healthy, so I don't think there is anything medically causing this.

If I can't get her motivated enough to follow a lure, I'm feeling at a loss. I think she is too. I attempt to start a simple behavior, such as moving into a standing position (starting her at a sit and bringing the lure toward me to encourage her to stand and follow it) but instead she just gets frustrated and goes through her bag of tricks (usually ending up in her ""play dead"" position, hoping to be rewarded). When she does this, I usually just move a few steps back, and start again, instead of saying anything, or rewarding. I also always try to end the training on a positive note with something she is strong at, just so she isn't 100% frustrated throughout the session.

I've never had a dog that has acted like this before (I've only come across one or two that weren't food motivated in my teaching training, and we easily found other motivators instead). Am I just trying too hard?

Any tips? Suggestions?

1353261532.0	13elxt	Boyfriend's dog reluctant to leave apartment with boyfriend	zippityflip	17	6	6	"My boyfriend has lived with his 13-year-old shepherd mix ""Fido"" for 12 years. My boyfriend and I have been together about 2 years and have lived together about 1 year. I've hung out with Fido for 2 years but my boyfriend is still the primary walker. I maybe walk him 5 times a week. I'm sometimes the one to take him to the vet.

Lately, Fido only seems to want to walk with me. If I'm home, Fido hangs out in the room I'm in and if my boyfriend wants to walk him, Fido will lie on the ground or otherwise refuse to go. If I'm not home, there's less often an issue - Fido only refuses sometimes. Fido never refuses to go out when I walk him, or if boyfriend and I walk him together. 

The only difference between us that I can see is that I'm a little more of a disciplinarian - I make Fido walk behind me down the stairs, and I'm teaching him ""stop"" to make him halt. 

This is sort of putting a strain on our relationship because my boyfriend is oscillating between saying untrue self-deprecating things like ""Fido likes you more than me!"" and untrue insulting things like ""He only wants to go with you because you let him eat things off the street."" My boyfriend is also getting super critical of the way I walk Fido when we go together - ""you're giving him too much/too little leash, you're letting him sniff that tree too long, you didn't let him sniff that other tree that I always let him sniff, don't walk him on the left walk him on the right,"" etc. He had this critical tendency already, but I think Fido's behavior is putting him on edge. 

I can imagine the positive feedback loop in which all these things are enforcing one another - boyfriend feels insecure, dog feels more secure with me, makes boyfriend more insecure - but I was wondering if anyone has ever dealt with a similar situation, and if so, what helped. I feel, btw, like it will be easiest to change my behavior, so if there's something I can do differently, please tell me. I feel like I have a warped version of what's going on because my boyfriend and I are not communicating well about this issue."	t5_2r067	True

She has been raised with other dogs and acts normally around them, but any time we see another dog besides the two she was raised around, she starts making crying/baying noises and desperately wants to get to them. This of course often gets other dogs very worked up and I'm concerned that she'll start a fight or draw an aggressive dog to attack. If we do go up to another dog, she wants to sniff them but appears scared when they want to sniff back and mostly runs away.

What I would ultimately like is to have her more calm and interacting normally with dogs outside the ones she knows well.

1352735308.0	132e49	My Great Pyrenees Barks Constantly	myATXtruck	12	0	17	"I have a 2 year old pure bred GP and a 18mo pit mix. While a bit on the hyper side, the pittie has been very easy to train and to break of any bad habits.

Adding the pit to the family has helped train the GP quite a bit, though it's still a struggle. We've never found a food treat that appeals to the GP for more than a couple of training sessions, but he gets very jealous of any attention we give the little pit and will get with the program. This has helped a lot, and now he's making good progress on his training.

The only exception is in his barking. When outdoors, he will bark. He patrols the fence and barks this slow, rollings ""ro-ro-ro"". He'll sit in the flower bed and bark. He'll lay on the patio and bark. Sometimes, he'll even lay on his side and bark. The only time he doesn't compulsively bark outdoors is if I go outside... and I don't even have to pay any attention to him. I can completely ignore his existence and go about my business, or sit on the deck and read a book. He's perfectly content to lay on the other side of the yard, both of us ignoring each other, and let me read a book ... but if I'm not out there, he spends a good deal of time barking.

This summer, I spent a good deal of time just chilling on the porch reading books and he seems to have chilled on this type of barking. It still happens here and there, but I just step outside, take a moment for him to stop and relax, praise him, and then step back inside and all is well.

But then there's his actual Alert barking. Our house backs up to a green zone and there's plenty of squirrels, feral cats, deer, possums, and lord knows what that prowl the area. Additionally, after a 6 month vacancy, the house next door was rented out last month. Now, if _anything_ happens on the other side of our fence, he's got to let the neighborhood know about it.

My fiancee and I have tried several permutations of one of us, or friends or neighbors, crashing through the woods, while we calm him ... but this goes back to the idle barking above. As long as we're in the back yard with him, none of this bothers him. If we're there, a construction crew can work in the green zone and he doesn't even notice. If we're not there, though, the world must know.

I can't be in the back yard 24/7 ... and he's a Great Pyr and, while he is crate trained, crating him will practically take over an entire room of our house... what's a guy to do?

So, the first time was at a fenced in dog park, when she was about 7mo. We were walking into the holding area as usual when this young Shepard mix came up to the fence and growled at my dog. My dog immediately growled back and actually lunged/barked at the fence as if she were trying to attack. I had never seen her act so aggressively, so I was hesitant to even go into the dog park at that point. After a few moments of calming her down though, we entered and all was well. That is, until my dog got anywhere near this Shephard dog's owners. She was highly protective of them and would chase off any dogs that got close, my dog included. Though nothing happened (my dog just ran away), I was angry at these people for bringing their obviously overprotective dog to a public park where it was not only unpredictable but they did nothing to stop the dog from acting that way either. 

I left, chalking the behavior up to the other dog. But then...

Tonight, I went over to a friends house and brought my dog with me. She is also currently unspayed and about 1 week has passed since she's had her first heat. They have two fixed Beagles (male and female), and the moment we stepped inside, the male Beagle went nuts doing the trademark howl and it set off an aggressive reaction in my dog. She growled quite ferociously and lunged at the other dog, just like the dog park incident. No biting occurred because we intervened, but it was scary since she is so big (bout 30"" tall and nearly 100lbs). 

We took them both outside on leads to let them calm down and be reintroduced, but any time the Beagle came near her, she would growl and attempt to lunge, which in turn freaked him out all the more and would cause him to howl out of fear. It was a feedback loop so they had to be separated the entire time, which kind of made the night a hassle for everyone involved, making me wish I'd never brought her. :( 

I guess my question is, if any of you have had to deal with this sort of thing and how you went about modifying the behavior. She is clicker trained to do the basics so she is manageable, but I've never had to deal with a behavior that was potentially harmful to other dogs.  

She is totally fine with people and new places, but she gets excited easily and as this is the second time, seems to also be reactive to other unstable dogs. I can't hold her attention for very long when she's in this state- I have to drag her away and force all commands on her. However, if the dog doesn't act scared or aggressive towards her, she is fine. We have gone to dog parks and beaches and she plays happily with the other dogs just fine. 

I am sure that her being unspayed is a contributing factor, but how much of one is it I wonder? As mentioned, she will be going in for her spay in December, but she wasn't in heat back when the dog park incident happened and that was neutral ground, so it makes me wonder if its more deep seeded than raging hormones.

one evening (he hadn't been left alone at night too much, but this wasn't the first), i come home to pee and poop on his bed and floor after only two hours away. cleaned up, thought it was an isolated incident. put tarp on my bed just in case. then one night a fire alarm when off when i wasn't there, and he peed and pooped on my bed. that was really disturbing. after that, he did it twice more with no triggers, and now i can't trust him home alone. i tried to crate train as if we were starting new, very slow. he liked sitting in his crate with the door open anyway. first time i left him alone in the crate (only two hours), he chewed so hard he bent the steel door. i tried another two days of slow, gradual crating. then he busted OUT of the crate just on friday.

not really sure what to do at this point. his separation anxiety seems to be increasing, i can't find gates to confine him to certain parts of studio because, well it's just a big room. i talked to a behaviorist and he thinks the dog has some panic issues, but not a housebreaking issue. and he generally doesn't have any other behavior problems, and this behavior problem seems fairly sporadic. dog training might be helpful, but not sure if it can fix it. going to to set up a webcam, but not sure what else to do at this point."	t5_2r067	True

1345709017.0	yoq07	My Mother gives in to the family dog's constant demands for table scraps. She is now severely overweight and can barely walk. Please help.	Frostfall	16	4	12	"Hello all.

First and foremost, I apologize if this is in the incorrect subreddit. However, as I feel that this is relevant to a training issue, I have decided to post here. **If this is indeed the incorrect subreddit, would someone be so kind as to direct me to one which may be able to assist me?**

My family owns a miniature schnauzer, named Emily, and she's around 8-9. While she was growing, it was not uncommon for my Mother to give her leftovers (from dinner, her lunch, whatever) to prevent her from begging for food. This has backfired terribly. Emily now barks nearly nonstop in the early morning (4:30 AM) and when my Mother returns home from work until she retires to bed for the night.

Each time she begs for food of some sort, my Mother is quick to give in to her demands to keep her quiet. She is most commonly fed leftovers from dinner, and piles of dog biscuits. She is now severely overweight and cannot walk without dragging her hind legs slightly. I have tried everything to show my Mother that what she is doing is considered positive reinforcement, and that it will only encourage Emily to continue to beg. I have tried reasoning with her, taking the junk food away, standing in the kitchen to make sure the dog is not fed anything other than her own food.. To no avail. All of these have led to arguments with her stating that the only issue is with how *much* table food is given to the dog, instead of whether she should be given table scraps or not. She claims it's 'just the dregs/scraps'; it's not, as she's fed large amounts of leftovers to her more than a few times. 

I am presented with two critical issues at this time. My Mother refuses to believe that any type of training will convince the dog to stop barking, and I'd like to show her that this is a misconception. Does anyone have any ideas as to how I could train my dog to stop begging? The best suggestion I've read online was placing the dog in another room during meals, which I tried, but this also led to a screaming match with my Mother saying how ""unfair"" it is to be placing the dog into a separate room. 

We have taken her to a vet recently, due to the fact that she's having difficulty walking. My Mother refuses to see that she's clearly gaining weight from the excessive amounts of table scraps being fed, and claims that she's just ""getting old"" and that ""her hips hurt"". While both of these may be true, the extra weight is certainly not helping with any of the pain that Emily is feeling. The vet warned my Mother that she should never be giving Emily table food, but did say that carrots and apples as an occasional snack are acceptable. My Mother blew this out of proportion and thinks that she can feed Emily as much junk as she wants, provided that apples and carrots are thrown into the mix.

Emily has another appointment with the vet, today, around 6:30 PM. During the last appointment, my Father made an attempt to address the table scraps issue with my Mother present in the room, which only led to my Mother becoming extremely angry, insisting that my Father didn't know what he was talking about, and that she would 'never give junk to the poor baby'. **I will be calling the vet today to inform them that yes, the dog is being fed excessive amounts of table food, despite what she may claim.** 

I suppose the main issue here would be.. What is the proper way to train my dog in a way that is not abusive or ""unfair"", as my Mother claims? And if the vet is of no help, how am I able to proove to my Mother that the excessive amounts of junk in Emily's diet are causing serious harm to her?

**tl;dr: The family dog begs for table food, and my Mother gives in to her demands each time. She refuses to believe that there is any other way to prevent the dog, who is now severely obese, from barking Help!**

Sometimes though he'll still hold on to the tug toy and keep pulling even when I repeat the command, at that point what should I do? 

I feel like if I just release the tug toy, then he'll think it's okay to ignore the command because he 'won'. If I just hold the tug toy in place, he'll just keep holding on and sometimes still keep pulling - so if I do that he'll think he can ignore it and just keep playing?

To give a more detailed description on what normally happens, while we play sometimes I give the command and he releases I'll praise or click/treat him. Sometimes he doesn't release on the first command, so then I get closer to him and use a sterner voice to do the release, and if he listens then he gets praise or click/treat, and both of these work 80% of the time. I'm just not sure what to do after that doesn't work.

1335224339.0	sp0sh	Advice re: visitors &amp; barking at night, please	fstop2	15	1	9	"We have a 7mo old 44# lab/pit mix that we got from a rescue a little over a month ago. She's gotten very used to us and gone from [afraid to walk out the door](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/r5ix0/just_rescued_a_sweetheart_but_shes_afraid_to_go/), to a (mostly) happy walker and even trots with us as we jog. She's submissive and complacent with us (doesn't really put up a fight if we have to pick her up, bathe her etc.)

She has two things that need work though, so I'd appreciate any advice before we can get an appt with a trained behaviorist. 

1. She's become territorial as she's gotten used to us. Barking at passers by, etc, nothing really unusual. (I just frosted the windows to reduce the stimulus, which has helped a bit). She doesn't, however, like it when we have people over. Unless she remembers them from meeting them before (like my parents), she growls (although it sounds more like a nervous/discontent grumble), paces, her heckles come up, and sometimes barks.  We should have started bringing people by right away, but she is/was great with people at the park and day care, so we didn't see this coming. She'll take treats from the visitors, gently, even perform the commands she knows. But if someone uses the bathroom and comes out, its as if they were never inside. I don't want to correct her growl/grumble, because if its a warning, I want it there, but I also don't want to have to hover over her or have my wife nervously watch her every second. Tips?

2. She sleeps in our room with us at night (in her crate or on the floor). She's been great at coming to bed, and laying down quietly if she doesn't get right to sleep. The past two nights however, she has decided to start barking at the house (as far as I can tell). A stern ""No!"" is useless, and since we're both trying to sleep, we don't have treats etc. Eventually I get up, let her check the house, see there's nothing there, and she comes back to bed. Last night she laid down, let out a couple of little woofs and then went to sleep, so I'd say it worked. However, I don't want to have to do that every night, and my wife has to get up early and gets frustrated a bit more quickly than I do. Tips on how to correct it, or train her how to quiet down and go to bed? 

Other notes: we just got a clicker, and are still reinforcing it for training. 

TL;DR 
1. Looking for tips on getting her to become tolerant of visitors. 
2. How to tell keep her quiet when all the lights are off and everyone is going to bed. 

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the wall of text. 

4/26 **update**: We have a behaviorist coming on Saturday. A little pricey, but she has all the certifications and reviews, so we'll see.
We pushed up the urgency after watching her jump and try to nip at visitors. We have a regular houseguest (comes once/month for a couple nights usually) who has met her before. She grumbled the first time, but not this time. She seemed to remember him, but wasn't excited/happy greeting him. She approached him without noise, let him pet her, would take treats etc. But she watched him in a weird way, and as soon as he got up to move, she jumped and tried to nip. We weren't fast enogh to do anything the first time, and she missed, but she tried more than once. The 2nd time, we gave her a stern 'no' and put her into another room, alone. A minute or so later, once she was quiet, I let her out. She walked straight for our guest, and stood at his feet, watching him again. He pet her, she sat, but as soon as he went to move again, she tried again. I blocked her (at her chest) mid air, grabbed her and gave her another time out. She didn't try a 3rd time, but it got us wondering about her. I'll update again as more info comes in.

And we've cut the jogging out until we can get a medical opinion. Does make it harder to wear her out on a rainy day though... (no park to go to)"	t5_2r067	True

As such, we decided to crate our dog since it was something a lot of people here generally advocate and a lot of people I know have done this. Growing up with dogs, we didn't use this method but there was always someone home to let the dogs out or watch them, so it just wasn't needed. I don't think its punishment at all, I think its a great tool, but I'm wondering why my dog is doing better without it?

I would say that our frenchie tolerated it. He did not love it, but he didn't hate it either -- had no kind of anxiety with the crate. More recently, he started having occasional accidents in it and we weren't sure why. Then the holidays came and we were home all day and barely used the crate. Always had it and still have it on hand with a blankie and some toys in it, but not actively used during holidays or now.

Fast forward to now, our dog was exhausted from the holidays. So one day while going to work, we just left him on the couch to snooze. We ended up putting a camera on him to watch him while we're at work...and he's fucking amazing. We're on day 3. He just sleeps all day on the couch. No accidents, no chewing, and he's not wired when we get home from work. He literally doesn't ruin anything. Most of all, we were having trouble getting him to eat his kibble. Now I leave his dish out and it's gone by lunch. 

All of these bad habits he's had have seemed to vanish. He's an angel. He seems more confident, before he'd follow me like a shadow, but now he's content being in another room alone chewing on a bone. How/why is he acting like this? Why was he acting out before? He is only 9 months old and I swear to god we didn't ramp up to this. A while ago I posted asking what would be a good way to start weening off the crate and a lot of people either said don't do that or to start leaving him slowly, building up the time gradually. But we didn't even do this. Is he mindfucking us or something? "	t5_2r067	True

1320363743.0	lzmda	Training puppy, parents' and their dogs getting in the way	flyinfart	12	0	1	"I am desperate, /r/dogtraining. I want to explain the full situation and give as clear a picture as possible.

I rent a room from my parents. They have two cockapoos who are both about seven years old now, and a labradoodle who is almost two. Their dogs are half trained, spoiled, have horrible leash manners, and their physical wellbeing is neglected. Walked maybe once or twice a week, if walked at all. Before, I could justify it by telling myself that it is their business, not mine. I take them out occasionally, practice tricks, and feed them in the morning when I wake up for work. My parents want something to cuddle when they are done with school/work, but don't want to take the time to genuinely train them. They know how to be bribed for sit, lay down, come, and have been 'taught' stay at least a dozen times.

About ten weeks ago, I adopted an 11 week old, black standard poodle puppy (Shisa) and its been a total learning experience. I was not prepared for a puppy. But I'm not about to give up, he is a great dog and I really do love him. Started teaching with dominance theory, a prong collar, and tried disciplining with negative and positive reinforcement. After a week, I was almost to tears because I knew it wasn't working and he was just miserable. Took me several weeks before I realized how broken dominance theory is and how ineffective negative responses were for a puppy (I feel rather dumb), but was having trouble finding a good source to draw from. Finally found you guys, and he is doing 200% better.

In the past 10 weeks since I got him (now 21 weeks old), he has learned sit, come, speak, is still learning bite inhibition, and knows to bark to be let out to go potty. He is getting the hang of being on a lead, learning stay and not to chew on the furniture, and I am trying to figure out heel. He has loads of toys, and between the couple of ropes, kongs, balls, and stuffed animals picked up from the local Goodwill, is quite happy. Especially since there is a two year old labradoodle to play with while I am at work.

The first problem is that there are three poorly trained dogs who are teaching him some very, very bad manners. The labradoodle lets him break skin chewing on her (at dog parks, Shisa still hasn't figured out that nipping other dogs is not okay, and even though it hasn't been an issue with other owners, it definitely will be), the dogs bark at everything that passes the house (which he is happily following along with), bad leash manners, begging, and that its okay to just ignore commands.My parents have absolutely no interest in regular exercise or enforcing any rules, and figure that is up to me. I can't put him in a kennel, my parents will let him out while I'm at work and for one dog to be kenneled while the other three aren't feels like torture. I've insisted and begged that they train their dogs, take them out and play and practice daily. And it has worked, but never past a weeks worth of time. They feel that as long as their dogs are getting enough to eat and have a warm place to sleep, that it is good enough. I don't believe that they deserve to have dogs, and that just feeding them and letting them sleep in your bed is enough. But the fact is they have better homes than the animal shelter would give them, and the people who live in this area share a similar attitude with my parents- alcoholism and neglect are common family problems here if that means anything to you.

My Questions:
How do I at least teach their dogs basic manners when I am not regularly at home; and while I am out, they are allowed to revert to their bad behavior?

The second problem is the fact that my puppy is constantly being exposed to this. How do I go about training my dog who is otherwise amazing, when he has so many bad examples?"	t5_2r067	True

Something I've noticed is that for the majority of commands she's visual based and not sound based. What I mean is I can say any word I want or not even say anything and give a hand signal or facial expression to get my pup to perform one of her tricks. The two exceptions so far are sit and come here. I know I need to add and reinforce stay,drop it and leave it into that pile as well. 

Outside of the basics such as ""sit/stay/drop it/leave it/come here"" are there any other commands that should be based upon words primarily? Her name is a given as well to be able to gain focus of course. But is it in best practice to transition towards just the word command or is being able to just raise my eyebrows and mouth the word woof to get her to speak enough?

**Second:** Peeing inside. We have been trying to teach him to wee outside but he still pees inside sometimes.

1375897351.0	1jwace	Please help! My Australian Shepherd might be showing signs of aggression at only 8 weeks!	RabidKillerPoof	20	10	30	"A little background:

I got my Aussie two weeks ago from a local breeder. When I brought him home he was acting very lethargic and whenever I tried to pet him he would get up and move to another spot. I thought it was just separation anxiety due to being away from his litter mates and mother. Well, that evening I noticed he had diarrhea, and started vomiting the next morning. So, I took my dog to the vet and he had coccidia and tapeworms. He has now been given a clean bill of health from my vet! Yay.
 
The problem:
He still doesn't seem to want to listen to me, or want to be around me at all. When I take him outside to go pee he doesn't come when I call, no matter how excited I get. When I come home from work or wake up in the morning he doesn't seem happy or excited and he never EVER wants to sit in my lap or cuddle. He never wags his tail or wiggles with excitement when he sees me. I try talking baby talk, giving him treats, and playing. I make sure to never yell at him either because I read in a book I bought on Aussie how sensitive they can be. He is also extremely nippy and has actually broken the skin while playing and it makes me scared he might be showing signs of aggression. I've tried ignoring, a firm ""No."", gentling holding his mouth shut, yelping like an injured puppy then ignoring until he calms down, and redirecting but he keeps coming at me and seems to be more excited by it.  I take him outside to pee once every hour and for short walks in the early morning and late evening before it gets to hot. The only time I can get him to pay attention to me is when I'm trying to get him to learn tricks. He has also learned sit, down, roll over, shake, and high five and I am working on other commands as well to give him mental stimulation. 

So, here are my questions:
Is my dog still sick?
Am I doing too much or not enough?
Is this normal or do I just have an antisocial/aggressive puppy? 
Could it be because of the trauma of being sick?
Am I doing to much with the little guy?

I am taking him to the vet later this week to get his shots so I am going to ask my vet, but I wanted other peoples opinions as well. I love my dog and want him to be as happy as possible and will do anything to help!

Edit: I did communicate with the breeder as soon as my dog, Oliver, started vomiting, and his response was ""I don't know what you want me to do about it. Just wait it out I'm sure he will get better on his own."" Instead I took him to the vet because I then didn't trust the breeder.

He's fun to watch romp around with other dogs off leash, but I'm having a bit of trouble training him /not/ to initiate play with other dogs we meet while he's on leash on walks. We've been training him to heel and walk with a loose leash, which is progressing (especially in our neighborhood and familiar places), and he'll respond when called from most distractions (plants, neat smelling things), but as soon as he sees someone else, especially with another dog, it's so hard to get his attention--he wants to move toward them! We try to stop completely (not rewarding the pulling), but even stopping he'll simply sit/stand and stare eagerly. If they approach, he'll greet politely, but sometimes start play bowing/getting excited at the possibility of play if we stay with them for more than a few seconds.

I've heard that, when working with distractions, to start as far away from the distraction as possible, but I'm not sure the best way to work with this particular distraction. I've tried turning around on walks when I see another dog, seeing how long I can have him heel, rewarding him with treats and praise when he stays by me instead of lunging toward the person/dog--but it's not always practical to turn around. Maybe I just need to accept that, if I want a well-trained dog, our walks may involve more turning around while we're working on this, or that I need to find another person with a dog willing to do some training sessions with me!

Anyone have any advice, experience, or links about training a very sociable pup? (Even general resources would be great!) Thanks all!"	t5_2r067	True

I am fostering a boston terrier x bulldog mix, he weighs about 40 pounds. We just got him yesterday, and found out that he is pretty dog aggressive. I normally wouldn't take on a dog aggressive dog since I have a 10 pound chihuahua who can't really defend himself against larger dogs. This other dog leaps and lunges at other dogs, on and off leash. He doesn't even seem to read their body language. The dogs that he met yesterday all acted very friendly and sweet and submissive towards him, yet all he wanted to do was jump in and fight. How can I help him get over this?

I don't care if he's a social butterfly, but I would like for him to calm down and also be able to coexist with our dog.

I already ran him for a half an hour this morning, and he was a panting and slowed down a little, but that still didn't tire him out. I am planning on taking him for another run after I get home from work. This one's going to whip me into shape!

After I take him on his second run I was thinking of taking him for a walk with our other dog, while my boyfriend walks our other dog, on the other side of the street. When he sees other dogs on leash he tends to freak out and run towards them. Then as soon as he gets to the end of his leash, he turns around and chomps down hard on his leash, shaking his head back and forth and backing away.

What do you guys think? Any advice would be much appreciated. "	t5_2r067	True

They said she was an 'outside only dog' and was therefore not trained, but we quickly converted her to an indoor dog. 
When we first got her, there were no problems with her not being house-trained. We lived in a secluded area with miles and miles of yard for her and my other dog to run free. When she had to potty we would just open the door, and the dogs would go and do their business and come back when they were done. This way, Syx became (apparently) house-trained, and NEVER made messes in the house.

However, a year ago we had to move to the middle of town in a much smaller house, with a tiny yard. We are obviously no longer able to let the dogs go free outside.

For some reason, Syx will NEVER potty outside now. She has taken to making a mess in a specific spot in our kitchen. We can take her outside 20+ times a day and she will do nothing out there. Then, when we bring her back inside she will sneak to the kitchen when no one is around and make a mess. She is completely ruining our floor and our home.

I don't really know what to do. She is older and I work 12 hours a night graveyard shift, so I have no idea what to do with her. I never catch her in the act of peeing on the floor, so I can't discipline her, and when I take her outside no matter what she does nothing. She I need help.

We have a 19 month old ACD mix. 

I've thought for months now that she's not kid or dog friendly. Not long ago we were at my mother-in-law's house and my niece came over, and my dog went nuts, barking (like mean, scary barking) and she was so bad I had to tether her outside. She's never reacted well to kids coming to our house. But. Those times? She's been in her dog run or in her  crate, not free in the yard.


Today, a friend and his 4 year old daughter dropped by unexpectedly, and let themselves into our yard. (Husband and kids were outside already, front and back are fenced with a 4 foot chain length fence.) The dog totally didn't react. She kind of fluffed her hackles once, and then she barked, one bark, like a kind of unsure curious bark. I let her inside at that point since I figured if she was unsure I'd let her escape. 

Just a minute ago the friend's kid came into the kitchen (dog is kept out of the kitchen by a gate) and dog barked, but it was not a mean bark, just a 'hey, there's a person there' type of bark.

I'm just really confused now. I actually had kind of been thinking she was aggressive all of this time, at least to kids and dogs, so we've been really careful to keep her away from those things. Now I'm wondering if she's just got leash reactivity?

(Also-all of this is my fault. I didn't do the whole socializing thing right, and then when she got adult-sized I was too scared/embarrassed to push on with it so I kind of gave up. Don't make my mistakes, socialize those puppies!)


I just found out there's a trainer an hour away from where we live (small town) so I'm going to get in touch with her for more help, but do you think there's hope here? Maybe I do have my 'go with us everywhere' dog, she just needs a little bit more work?

I have a 9 year old German Shepard/Hound mix. her name is Ginger and she is a very sweet and loving dog and has lived with my parents her whole life. I moved to college about two years ago. My parents have been really busy with work and my dad is sick, so my parents have asked if I could bring her to college with me. My apartment is very pet friendly. 

However, she has been there about a month and acts very differently now. At my parents she was NEVER a problem. But now every time I leave she barks, howls, and whines. For HOURS. She constantly follows me around the apartment and even whines when I close the door to go to the bathroom. What's worse is she does this even when my roommates are there. The only person she doesn't mind being left alone with is my boyfriend. My roommates can't close the door and go to sleep if I am at work late. One time she got so upset she chewed the door trim all up when my roommate left. She has NEVER been destructive. I feel like she is a different dog when she is at my apartment. 

Luckily the roommates have been gone for most of summer, but I am really worried she will start doing this again when they return, even though she has had a month now to adjust. She is just always stressed and I am worried for her health and the my roommates sanity, as well as mine. 

I feel like a big part of the problem is at home we had another dog, Dexter, the Shih Tzu. We got them around the same time and they have lived their whole lives together. I know this must be part of the problem, but there isn't much I can do. He is my brother's dog and he took him to college.

I asked the vet on how to help and she suggested giving her a treat every time I leave and a few other tips. I try not to be overly excited when I get home and take her on long walks to tire her out. She said as a last resort to use a shock collar, I really don't feel comfortable using that. I am more concerned about her anxiety than her barking. I also have tried over the counter anxiety medicine you can get at like Petco. The behavior got a little better for a while, but it has plateaued recently and really isn't improving. 

I am sorry for the long post, but I am really just at a lost on what to do. I love my dog very very much and would hate to give her up, but I have school and can't just sit at my apartment all day with her. I would really appreciate some tips and advice. The vet never mentioned prescription anxiety medication, but would that be an option? Other than this issue, she is a really great dog. I absolutely love her to death!   

Oh and one more thing, she isn't crate trained. We tried, but she is terrified of things over her head. We got her when she was a little older and she was a rescue so I am not sure why she can't do crates, but trust me she is terrified of them."	t5_2r067	True

I spent a lot of time compulsively browsing this subreddit before adopting my new puppy and am hoping you can give me some advice on how to best handle a problem we're running into with her training.

[Sitting on Toby, her favorite toy](http://i.imgur.com/CP1c14C)

[Very much a sweetheart](http://i.imgur.com/Zid90Vq)

[One more for luck](http://i.imgur.com/uzSaVm5)

My boyfriend and I brought home a new rescue dog (11 months old, and I think some combination of a Greyhound/GSD/Pit mix) 5 days ago. Overall, she's doing very well. She's adjusted to her new home, is eating well, has only had one housebreaking accident, and is responding well to her clicker training (she's already picked up 'sit', 'down', and 'stay' and is now working on 'come' and her leash manners). She's normally very loving and people-friendly.

Two days ago, she started exhibiting signs of resource guarding with a new toy we gave her (Busy Bee). Over the past two days, she's started guarding several other toys, from newly introduced toys to the very first toy we gave her. It's not consistent, but often when she's playing with one of her toys, she'll bare her teeth and snarl at me. What's particularly confusing is that she sometimes approaches me first, cuddles up, and then begins snarling. Last night, she grabbed her Busy Bee, snuggled up against me, and then started snarling and snapped out to try to bite me. 

I've researched resource guarding and have started trying to use treats to train her to associate my approach toward her toy with a pleasant reward. However, I've read conflicting things about taking the toy away once she begins snarling or snapping. Will it confirm her fear that I'm going to take her toy away? Or will it teach her that the behavior will not be rewarded?

The most befuddling part for me is that she has, for the most part, only directed this guarding behavior toward me, and not toward my boyfriend. This is confusing, and though I'm trying to be rational and understanding, a bit disheartening. I provide most of her care (I feed her, give her water, take her on her morning run, take her outside to use the bathroom, and give her each new toy.) My boyfriend is equally involved in her clicker training, takes her on walks, and plays with her as often as I do. Does anyone have any ideas why she might be snarling and snapping at me, and not my boyfriend? I feel like I've been very sweet to her, but I'm now concerned I might be doing something wrong. Why is she less comfortable with me? Could she recognize that I'm the ""alpha"" of the house and be making a dominance bid, or is it something else entirely?

I welcome all suggestions and very much appreciate your help!

**Tl;dr: Brought home a new rescue dog, she's resource guarding against me, but not my boyfriend. What's the deal?**

I can't even put on sneakers without her going crazy and thinking that we are taking a walk. She has been a healthy Sheltie for the past 9 years. 

About a month ago she began this thing where she will walk about a block, stop, and begin pulling backwards to head home. The first night this happened there was an outdoor band playing a mile or so away. I thought maybe that scared her however, she has become used to lawnmowers, etc and usually is not skittish on walks. 

At the same time this behavior began, she also was vomiting for about a week. Took her to the vet, explained all of these things, she took blood and put her on anti nausea pills. The blood work came back with some elevated kidney levels but not the ones that indicate failure -- just dehydration. 

I called the vet a week later when the vomiting subsided but the walk behavior did not and they have no solutions for me!

EndQuest	13	2	9	"All right, so you may not understand my enthusiasm, but we've recently learned that our dog may finally be certified by TDI (assuming she passes the test). It wasn't until recently that TDI revised their rules and now they allow deaf dogs to be certified by their organization, though they have to pass an additional test called the 'Startle Test'. 



Our Australian Shepherd always seemed like a good fit for therapy work, she's very gentle and calm, but when we realized that she couldn't be tested, we didn't work as hard on her manners as we might otherwise have. So we're going to tighten up her loose leash walking. If anyone has ever worked on teaching a heel to a deaf dog, I'd like any tips you might have! She's also likes to put paws up on people (jumping up) so that's something we'll have to work on more. (She doesn't so much jump on us anymore, and when she does she much more gentle than she used to be. Just have to remove the behavior entirely.) What I'm really looking for is any experience people who might have tested for TDI might have to share, like deal breaking behaviors to watch out for, etc. 



If you have any training tips, don't hesitate to share links, etc. We plan to get her into a CGC class when one opens up so we can brush up in a group setting, but until then it's at home and in the public practice!

She's very sweet around people, and used to like other dogs, but after being attacked in two separate incidents at a dog park, she's become fearful of other dogs and gets aggressive if they approach her quickly or with their hackles up or fangs bared.  

The problem is, a lot of people in my area don't obey the leash laws.  I'm realistic enough to know that I probably can't change their minds, so I'm looking for ways to calm my dog's fear aggression.  I do know that if I can spot an incoming unleashed dog before she sees it, I can usually get her to sit/stay/down - and if she's down she won't go on the offensive.

The problem is, these unleashed dogs sometimes come out of the blue - around a corner - with no warning.

Please respond only if you have a suggestion about how to train my dog to deal with these situations.  I'm already trying to educate all my neighbors about my dog's fears and the importance of leash laws.

And after typing the last paragraph, I realized I'd also like input on one additional issue.  Is there something I can spray an attacking dog with, without causing a lot of pain or lasting harm?  I've tried a spray bottle with water, and it doesn't seem to do much good.  I don't want to resort to anything as extreme as pepper spray, because I don't want to inflict pain on these other dogs (especially as I see their behavior as something their humans have taught them or decided to allow).

My idea is that because he's had such bad experiences with other dogs, he is just trying to protect himself. 

He lives with my s/o and she's dog sitting her friend's border collie while her friend is out of town and from what I've seen he's a really sweet calm dog.

Though this doesn't seem to register to my pup and he would snap and bark at the border collie when he's usually quiet and never barks/growls unless the neighbor is coming home.

He is extremely sweet to people, it's just other dogs he would lunge at, bark at, or snap at.

We really want to get her some exercise because we live in an apartment with no backyard. How can we get her to open up to going on walks?

So far, this has happened:

**First walk**: She almost never moved when we put her on the ground. She immediately stops and pushes her feet so hard against the ground so she won't move. She stays put and even tries to run the opposite direction of where we're going. I carried her a lot of the way (we were going to a Petsmart) but we went to a small area near a church for her to play around on the grass in. Though it took A LOT of calling and praising, she finally started following us on the leash in the courtyard. However, when it came time to start walking home, she stopped again.

**Second walk:** We tried taking her to a park a couple blocks from home. We had to carry her the entire way there and all the way back. However, we found a pretty empty grassy area where she really started to walk with us and run around, which was great. She played  a little but when we tried to go off the grass, she froze again waiting to be picked up.

We have tried and tried to get her comfortable with the leash. We endlessly praise her and tell her how good she is when she does walk with us and never scold her for stopping. How can we make her more comfortable while walking? Or is there another way to get her exercise? "	t5_2r067	True
1370609689.0	1fuwy3	"""Accidents"" 3 days in a row now."	TheLumberViking	14	4	3	"2 weeks ago today I moved with my 1-1/2 year old pit-mix to a smallish 3 room apartment. He was a little anxious at first, I had to start over again on the separation anxiety issues we used to have but it went pretty fast. The biggest issue was that I couldn't get him to poop in the yard until a week in. He would only go on walks or when I went back to my parents house. 

He had an accident the second full day of being left at the apartment. It didn't surprise me and I hoped it would help get him going in the morning when he had the opportunity. He did, and it was going well until Wednesday. 

Wednesday morning, 20 minutes after I had stood outside with him waiting for him to go for 20 minutes, I left the apartment to do laundry downstairs. I come back to a pile on the carpet. I clean it up with little more than grumbling on my part. Yesterday, same deal, he won't go in the yard. I get a shower and find another pile on the carpet, same general area. Today, another shower, another pile.  

I'm holding him outside long enough, running him around. I've been a morning person and really attentive to him. It's not like he's being neglected and trying to find a way to get my attention. It also concerns me that it is so early in the day. It's not like he just couldn't hold it anymore, we were just out.

1370105563.0	1fgy61	Is play-biting ever okay?	moughan	12	0	31	Hello again, r/Dogtraining! So I was just watching that hilarious youtube video with the Boston Terrier being tickled ([this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=OgrZ5Dtsi-E)), and it made me wonder about play-biting and whether it's ever okay to allow the behavior. My dog (11yo toy poodle) does the thing sometimes when he's on his back and I'm rubbing his belly where he gets a little excited and will growl a little and gently gnaw on my hand. I'm *pretty* sure it's playful - he'll usually raise his lip before he gets serious - but I do know that he's very hesitant to bite me, even when he doesn't like what I'm doing, so I can't rule out the possibility that he's not actually having fun. Now, the second he starts opening his mouth, I stop tickling him, but we used to play a lot like that when he was younger, and I was just wondering if it's ever an acceptable form of play, or if one should always discourage biting/mouthing.	t5_2r067	True

1369844827.0	1f9y9g	My dog grabbed another dog by the neck and tried to shake it like a toy. Never done this before.	sugarhoneybadger	11	2	7	"This is another post about my 4 yr-old rescue GSD. I mostly need to vent because yesterday was pretty stressful and I'm not sure how to proceed as a responsible owner. FYI, we are working with a trainer on these issues, but it's a group class for reactive dogs so I don't get as much one-on-one consultation as I would with private lessons.

My dog, Gypsy, has leash reactivity with other dogs but plays pretty well off-leash... normally. Yesterday when I got home from work, my fiance said that at the dog park she grabbed a rat terrier *by the neck* and shook it like a tug toy. This really bothers me. Nobody was hurt, the owner was very apologetic because she had her small dog in the big dog area and there were other dogs there harassing it before my dog decided to join in. However, I feel terrible about it and I'm at a loss about how to interpret Gypsy's behavior. She has also been really barky at other dogs when we walk downtown and it's embarrassing as hell. People are afraid of her because she's so big, even though she's never hurt anybody and is not human-aggressive at all.

The thing is, I don't think Gypsy is necessarily fear aggressive, just nervous and excited. Her body language when seeing other dogs is as follows:

1. See other dog. Ears and tail erect, mouth open, walk to the end of the leash and stare. Sometimes she sits and licks her lips.

2. Start pulling/lunging to get at the other dog. Lots of calming signals. If I get within 15-20 ft and restrain her, she starts barking. I let her greet another dog on leash *once* (being very careful to watch body language) and she just went round and round trying to sniff its rear end. 

3. She has also run into other dogs when she is on-leash and the other dog is off-leash (not something I can control, unfortunately). Again, sniffing. She has tense body language, is standing as tall as possible, tail and ears up, and is ""looking down"" at the other dog with closed mouth while circling them and trying to investigate. This applies to dogs of any size. 

4. She usually then initiates play, or the other dog will initiate play. If I try to lead her away, she barks. 

At the dog park, she exhibits pretty much the same behavior. She will rush up to other dogs, sniff them in the face, and start circling them. Then she will either leave them alone or play chase with them. She  *does not* like it when other dogs try to sniff her butt. She spins like a top trying to avoid it, tail tucked and ears down. But other than the incident yesterday, she hasn't been mouthy with other dogs. She will also ""stalk"" other dogs, staring at them and walking towards them in a crouching position.

My fiance and I are trying to decide what her interactions with other dogs should consist of at this point. It is not possible to isolate her completely because we live in a town where dogs are everywhere: some people let their dogs run free, many people take them to work, to go shopping, and of course the parks are crowded. I usually walk her at times when it's quiet so that her daily exercise isn't too stressful, but there are always dogs barking at her from behind barriers. For on-leash scenarios, we are trying BAT and ""watch me"" and will keep working on raising her threshold, but it's an uphill battle.

Should I let her keep socializing off-leash at the park and on hikes, or is her behavior with the rat terrier a sign that she could be dangerous? It seems to me that she acts calmer if the other dog is calm, but if it's a small dog that's afraid of her, she tries to chase it. While we work on her reactivity issues on-leash, is it beneficial for her to spend time learning appropriate greeting and play behavior from other dogs, or is that actually making things worse? I will ask my trainer these questions at class, too."	t5_2r067	True

So I just got my little bundle of joy on Monday afternoon.  She was being kept outside in a pen with the rest of her litter. She was the thinnest of the lot and she is very sweet. 

She is obviously not house broken, which is why we NEED to keep her in a kennel during the day while we work. I don't mind if she sleeps with us because she isn't big enough to jump off the bed and make a mess [when she is she will need to be kenneled at night as well until we train her. ]

I have already been told I need to get a divider for the create because it is just too big for [right now.  Blood hound Coon hound mix. ] I get paid tomorrow so that will come with shots.  

Every ""how to""i look at said to make the crate Somewhere she would want to go on her own.  Someplace fun.  Well she already hates it and I'm not site how to make a place of confinement somewhere she wouldn't mind being.  I put all of her toys in there. I toss het favorite toy in there whenever I can.  I feed her in there I put a few blankets including one she took a liking to, I put on music when we play and leave it on when I put her in.  She calms down after a minute of someone is in the room continuously telling her to hush and lay down, but the minute I leave the room she whines loudly and occasionally howls. 

They also say not to leave them in for extended periods of time but I need to leave her in it today, I can't take her to work again. So its happening today regardless, but I need to get her comfortable with it as soon as possible so she doesn't disturb our next door neighbors. we live in a duplex. 

Please help me! We love this dog and while it's unfortunate we had to get one so young, that's the circumstances that we were dealt.

In his early years, we frolicked on 10 acres in the Texas hill country.  Streams, grottos, jackrabbits and no fences was a daily experience.

As we've both aged, we've moved to the city.  After An adjustment period, all was fine. He is a gentle, friendly dog.  Submissive to any aggression, as violence is virtually nonexistent in his life.

Then, about 3 years ago, he was viciously attacked by a pitbull.  I was about 50 yards away when this happened.  I sprinted over and tackled the pitbull with a degree of force that rendered it a frightened puppy.  I pinned it down by the throat until my dog had fled, gushing blood.  Over the next few months, he physically recovered fully, as none of the injuries were significant enough to be any more than infection risks.

Psychologically, however, he is literally frozen in fear when I'm not accessible. I'm now married, and my wife insists on the bedroom portions of our home being dog free zones.  When he is gated out of the area and we are not around him, he abandons his fresh chew toys and bones and, instead, chews at his own flesh relentlessly.  I'm certain that the chewing begins as an itch, but he gnaws at it until its a hairless, irritated hot spot.  

He has 4-6 of these spots.  While I'm fully educated on the nursing of these hot spots, complete with a cone.. It's become a constant in our lives to maintain his nervous habit.  I am home pretty much all day and night, I am self employed.  I spend no less than 30 minutes a day giving him direct, loving attention.

Does anyone in this sub have any advice on how to deal with the psychological root of this issue, so I can grant this amazing dog a care free, relaxing final chapter?

TL;DR BREGO LOVES THE TRAILER

I took I_am_quite_nervous advice and brought the trailer in the house. I asked him nicely to go in it. (this took a moment of coaching( once he was in I gave him a few pets and his food. We did this for the next few days  when we were eating or relaxing. This was his ""safe"" zone. If he jumped out we would let him stay out for a bit them ask him to go back in. After a day of doing this he would fall asleep in it. Then I closed ( I did not zipper it yet) the flap. Once he was ok with that then I closed it half way so he could still get out. After a few hours of doing that I closed it all the way and only allowed him to come out when he was asked. We did this for 3 days and finally today we took him out for a 20 min ride. My boy friend first towed it around just to get the feeling of it so the first run with it on was not a disaster ( you never know). After that we called him in and waited a bit till he was ok with it. We went a few feet ( Me along beside him on the bike) stopped and praised him. After a while he was liking it so we went to the store and back! 

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ADVICE!!!! I am sorry that I did not get a photo but on his next trailer adventure I will take one.

Here is the main question I had.  Say I wanted to go out Friday night, and she is home with my parents.  I end up not coming home until well after they usually go to bed, but she needs to be in the crate (I have been keeping the crate next to my bed at night).  What should my parents do?  Should they bring her outside before they go to bed and put her in the crate in my room?  Should they put the crate in their room for the night?  What about nights when we are all out and she is in the crate for like 5 hours?  Will she be OK to be let out for a bit to potty, then be put back in for the night?

I apologize for the wall of text, I am just very concerned and kind of freaking out.  I'll feel terrible giving her back to the rescue center, but is that something I really should consider?

TLDR: I just got a puppy, which I have always wanted, but now I am suffering from pretty severe anxiety.  I am worried about leaving her alone at night and wondering how to go about leaving her in the crate before I get home, only to go to bed soon after.  Too much crate time?"	t5_2r067	True

She was severely underweight and petrified to use the bathroom where I could see. I assume she has had some rather aggressive attempts to potty train, as she cowers as though she's in trouble even if she's pooping outside.

I thought we had gotten through the fear stage without any harm, but last week, my year-old puggle (birthday tomorrow!) proved me wrong. As we were leaving the dog park, she was startled by a cyclist riding on a bike path. This has happened many times before to no ill effect; she was sniffing something, looked up, and he had sneaked up on her. She growled a little, and we moved on. About twenty feet further, she was distracted by some skateboarders in the distance. Suddenly, the same cyclist, who had looped around behind us, blew past her from behind. Well, that didn't go over well. She cowered all the way to the car and the whole ride home, drooling profusely and panting heavily. It got to the point where she was ducking trees that I drove under.

The three times we've been to the dog park since, she will run around for about five minutes and then completely ignore all the other dogs in favor of looking around frantically for what I can only assume to be cyclists and skateboarders. She pants, runs back and forth, and won't stray more than twenty or so feet from me. This is a HUGE problem because the dog park is about 75% of her exercise; walks just don't cut it and we don't have a backyard (apartment). Normally she will run and play to the point of exhaustion. I think it may have blown over if some of the regular dogs that she plays with were there, but the park was inexplicably devoid of regulars the last three days. And it's a really popular park. The planets have aligned to doom her to a life of fear.

How do I go about rehabilitating her? Do I find a skatepark and just feed her treats the whole time?"	t5_2r067	True
1366657657.0	1cvpy8	Transitioning house training after 12 weeks	donteatplato	12	1	2	"Our 11 week old golden retriever puppy is doing great with house training. Between crate training, frequent trips outside and a watchful eye we've had fewer and fewer accidents in the house. She's starting to really grasp going out means going pee and poop before playing and walks.

All the books and articles I've read have been incredibly helpful with the process of positive house training from 8 weeks to 12 weeks. But I'm fuzzy on how to transition from hourly trips as a baby to the few trips a day an adult dog needs.

At 12 weeks old do we start to stretch the breaks from one hour? For example, add 10 minutes a week (in other words, 70 minutes until week 13, 80 minutes until week 14)? Or is that too gradual? Or is there a certain point where they just ""get it"" and don't need a break?

I read that around 12 weeks they develop enough muscle control to hold it. Not sure if that means things change quickly, or if it still requires a very gradual change.

Right now she does great in the crate, she can hold it for 2 hours twice a day, and longer at night. When she's out of the crate, we're playing / supervising her in our large tile-floor kitchen. We'd love to introduce her to the other rooms in our home and play / supervise her there.

Aside from our kitchen and bathroom, the rest of our house has old New England style wide board hardwood floors. There are small gaps between some of the boards. We don't mind cleaning up an accident, but we're worried if she does pee it could soak into the gap and insulation below, making it nearly impossible to clean the scent out, and possibly leading to more accidents.

Also, how important is it to introduce one room at a time? Is it OK to change rooms as long as she's supervised? In other words, can we gate our living room with us in the morning, then gate her in the family room with us later in the day?

We'd love to transition her into other rooms in our house after she's 12 weeks old. We don't want to be helicopter parents, she's a dog and we know accidents will still happen. But any advice from those who know better would be greatly appreciated!"	t5_2r067	True

My lab/golden retriever mix is 2 years old. Anyways, she is a great dog and I try to do good by her by giving her good food, vet visits for her needles and all of that, toys, and some training but I'm no expert. We just know sit, stay, come, down, and those kinds of things.

My only real big problem is when we walk she's great but all of a sudden she'll stop dead still to sniff. Then she may or may not start pulling backwards to sniff something even better.

She walks great most times, but I'd like it if I could stop her from doing this. I tried using a ""go sniff"" phrase to say ""you can go check it out"". But how do I signal when it isn't okay? I don't mind her sniffing on walks most of the time because they're for her and I just want her to get out and smell stuff. I just don't want her to start trying to move backwards again. Right now I use come to call her to me, but I don't want to wear that word out. She gets treats for coming to me. 

She gets lots of exercise with a walk in morning, lunch time, and long walk in evening and dog play time with friends 4 or 5 times a week. She is very bouncy and loves people and other dogs.

Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask. 

Also sometimes she barks at dogs from far away. She gets excited. Is there a way I can stop that? No big deal if I can't. I just don't want her to scare fraidy dogs or people by thinking she's mean. She just barks because she wants to say hi and sniff them. I would feel more responsible in myself if she didn't do this.

I have a ~2 year old miniature dachshund, and he's highly reactive to strange dogs. I've been reading a lot about fearfulness and reactivity, and I think I understand the basics of BAT.

Today, we were out for a walk, and I noticed he was looking behind us very intently. When I looked in that direction, I saw a lady walking her two dogs on the other side of the road. It was the first time I can recall he hasn't reacted immediately on seeing another dog, so I decided to seize it as a training opportunity. I crouched beside my dog, and gave him a piece of dried liver every time he looked in their direction. It seemed to be going well, but suddenly when the woman was directly across from us, my pup flipped and went into a fully fledged reactive display (lunging, growling, barking, yelping, and just generally making a scene). At that point I just stayed there calmly, hoping for a calm second that I could reward him for, but he kept going until they were out of sight.

After he stopped, I turned in the opposite direction to where we were headed, because that was the same way the other dogs went. He wanted to go home, but I didn't want the walk to end on a bad note, or for him to think that all walks = bad scary things. He was hyper vigilant for about 10 minutes after, and spooked at a plastic bag which was unusual for him, but had no further incidents by the time we did eventually get home. 

Did I mess him up? I've read so many things about reactivity/anxiety that say you HAVE to keep your dog under threshold at all times.

Edit: Thanks for your support, everyone! I think I have an idea on how to handle the situation better now. "	t5_2r067	True
1365787116.0	1c7tv2	My dog is scared of being chased... by me?	JustDroppinBy	12	1	22	"**Background:**

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I've grown up with dogs. I have a way with domestic and farm animals that none of my friends can describe. I just seem to know what they're thinking or what they need by looking at them, but this one seems tricky.

I'm training my dogs to jog with me so I can take them on my route or to the mountains like I used to. I stopped taking them to the mountains because they had developed a preemptive strike pack mentality. You can imagine how that goes over with other dog owners on the trails. 

I've got two English Springer Spaniels. The older one, 5 y/o Sadie, has given me little to no trouble in her training. When she tries to lead, I speak her name and slowly turn and head the other direction. She catches on pretty quickly that we go where I dictate and not to get over-excited. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

**The Problem**: 

My 3 y/o, Sassy, is a beta by its strictest definition. She aims to please. She will cuddle 24 hours a day if I have the time. She loves to run and she likes going outside for walks, but when I try to pick up the pace and run alongside her, she gets scared. She ducks her little tail for a second, goes prone, lowers her head and looks up at me with big scared puppy eyes.

When she sees that I see that she has stopped, she rolls on her back and asks me to rub her belly, which I gladly oblige because I don't want her thinking she did anything wrong. She hasn't, she's just nervous.

I've only taken her on one walk recently (last Tuesday). I don't want her paws getting sore before they can develop callouses. After 10 minutes on our street of trying to persuade her, making it a few steps, and her sitting again, she decided she wanted to go home. I wasn't done yet, but this was clearly something that wouldn't be resolved with a single walk. 

She could still see home, which didn't help matters, so I picked her up and carried her about 100 yds and around the street corner, set her down, let her calm down and eventually we moved on. She wasn't quite so homesick at this point, so we started walking and I tried to bring it to a jog again. *BAM* She lays down. (She's dreaming and kicking her paws as I type this lol) 

I figured she had been in the heat long enough for the first time, and didn't want to stress her too much. She also has a dash of separation anxiety from her sister, so I knew she wanted to see her. I said the magic words, ""You wanna go home?"" and she started walking. 

On the way home, she would get a little excited and start to jog/run which I tried to match. By the end of the first run, on the way home, she would notice me running and stop, then I would stop and avoid eye contact, just looking ahead of us. She would start to jog again.

I know I can train her not to be scared of me while running, but I'm wondering if there's a faster way or, more importantly, a more comfortable way for her. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

**TL;DR:** My 3 y/o Springer Spaniel, Sassy, lays down scared of me when I try to run with her. I think I can gradually train her out of it, but I want to make sure it's the best way for her. "	t5_2r067	True

**Problem One- Potty Training** 

I work with her day and night. I reward her for good behavior and scold her when I see her have an accident, but it's ridiculous. She pees ON HER BED. On everyone's bed! She peed on MY bed! She's peed on her/Delilah's bed probably 15 times like it's a hot spot. She has full access to the doggy door and knows how to use it confidently.  I have no idea what to do. Delilah was trained so beautifully and never had a single accident that wasn't my fault. Even with my poodle, same thing. She had her problems, but she understood. 

**Problem Two- Biting and Jumping**

This is driving me NUTS. Constantly jumping. You'd think that she walks on two legs because she spends so much time on them. I try the sharp ""no"" and yipping, even a light tap. She won't get it. I think she should have at least learned that in a month. She also bites like crazy. Play bites, but bites nonetheless. She'll bite your legs, feet, arms, and especially your toes. I can't get it out of her. I'm constantly screaming. The neighbors must think I'm nuts. NONE of my dogs have ever done it to that extent. She's extremely playful, but she doesn't know how to be gentle. My big pit will bite her back gently and try to teach her, but even her doggy mentor isn't able to tame her. 

**Problem 3- Overly Assertive**

She is not aggressive, but she is VERY bold. If I push her, she'll push me back. She really wants to be dominant. She has a loud mouth. If you yell at her, she'll complain (which is actually a little adorable). But she never lets up. She always wants her way. The few times that I've so mad that I gave her a hard tap, nothing hurtful, she did NOT like it and let me know.

**Conclusion**

She's not aggressive. She's very dog friendly and LOVES people, that's the one thing I have been able to work with her on. I've been having her share her food bowl with Delilah sometimes, which isn't recommended, I know, but it's paid off in that she doesn't mind at all when you touch her face while she's eating. She'll sit on your lap for hours, but she will never ever EVER do anything she doesn't want to do. I don't think I'm prepared for this. I've never had a true pit, which she is or is very close to. Maybe this assertiveness is common. I think her behavior might have been caused by a lack of play time with her litter mates, since she didn't have such a good start. 

What can I do? How can I save my sweet girl? If I can't teach her, I might need to find somebody else who will. :( "	t5_2r067	True

She came from a puppy mill, and a possibly abusive home before I got her from what appeared to be a foster home (they were a bit shady and dishonest in hindsight, long story). We've worked on her many problems over the past year, and we've made good, albeit slow, progress. Her biggest problem right now is fear/aggression towards strangers and other dogs. We've been able to use 'Nevermind' to break her focus when we're out walking, and we've been getting it to work with people progressively closer. I take her to work with me, and she's good for the most part, since no one ever comes to the office that she doesn't know, and she's fine with familiar faces. Because her housebreaking is weak (having likely never been broken before me), it's never really been an option to leave her at home. She can gradually become comfortable with other dogs around if they're her size and they leave her alone, but she has no social skills at all. 

However, my working situation will be changing come September. I'll be moving to an office where I can't keep her with me. I can come home during lunch, but 4 hours is really pushing it for her bladder. She's been in diapers before, but I don't want to make that a long term solution.

I was wondering if anybody had any advice for building her confidence, and getting her to be more comfortable on walks.  She pulls at the leash and is very nervous.  We want to enroll her in obedience classes, but any advice to get us started before then would be appreciated!    "	t5_2r067	True

I have a 10 month old chihuahua neutered male.  Crated during the day when I'm gone, sleeps with me at night.  He's on a pretty good pee/poop schedule.  So pee first thing in the morning, eat, poop in an hour/maybe pee again.  Sometimes a noon pee break.  5pm pee, eat, poop etc.  

He's grasped the concept of peeing only outside.  But not asking to go out nor the pooping.  So if I take him out on schedule, he'll poop.  But if I miss it by a few minutes, he won't ask out, he'll just poop inside.  And if he's had his say morning poop but for some unique reason there's more, well then he won't ask out, he'll just poop inside.    

Right now, when I take him out for pee/poop it's in a small, fenced back yard.  I supervise, I praise, and then immediately when he's done, we come back inside.  (Walks on the leash are out the front door).  

Is there anything else I should be doing? He's still young and doing well over all, but it happens often enough that I fear he's not getting it.  Is this just me being impatient, he'll get it eventually if I maintain my consistency?  Or is there something else I should be doing?"	t5_2r067	True

I have a 2-year-old Lab/Bulldog mutt whom I adopted 3 weeks ago.  Things are going *great* with him.  Especially in the home, he's an angel.  Eeexcept for the Swiffer (Wet Jet).  I haven't figured out what sets him off, but I can't clean the floors unless I put him away in another room with someone to keep him calm-ish.  

He gets *very* excited around other dogs, but he's gotten a lot better with a sit and stay command to get him calmed down somewhat before meeting another dog.

I have tried setting the Swiffer out and letting him get acquainted.  He does fine with that.  The second I pick it up, all bets are off.  Maybe it's the whirring noise for the liquid dispenser?  Not sure.  

Any tips on how to keep an otherwise calm and friendly dog collected while I clean the floors?

Also, some advice on dealing with another trainer?"	DoggyDayCamp	11	2	11	"So, I just wanted to gush to all of you how absolutely thrilled I am with this sub-reddit! 
I am a dog trainer and I will admit that when I was on r/dogs and saw some of the things people were saying, I was more than hesitant about stepping into r/dogtraining...but I'm so glad I didn't stay away!
I just wanted to say thank you for the rules of this group and how y'all are against the dominance theory, positive punishment and so on! I know it sounds crazy to be so happy about this, but you would not believe the number of times I've had to explain the dangers of these misconceptions to customers and other trainers!

This leads me to my need of advice on how to deal with another trainer:
I'm one of two (soon to be three) trainers at my job where we are supposed to be strictly positive reinforcement, but the other trainer has been doing several things that worry and bother me.
For one...she screams at the dogs and teaches people to yell at them.
She tells people to squeeze lemon into a squirt bottle and spray it in the dogs' eyes.
She told a customer that the easy walk harness is like ""animal cruelty"" and tried to convince the customer to put a prong collar on the poor pup.
She has been spreading lies to customers about me.
She taught a little girl to not only alpha roll her pit bull, but to place her hands around the dog's throat and force it down until the dog was lying down (to teach the dog down).
She has straight-up kneed a dog in the chest for going the wrong direction.
She had a dog showing displacement behaviors and told his owner that he knew exactly what he was being asked to do but was just being a brat (she then proceeded to tell the person to sound angrier...).
And many more just plainly awful things...

I was hoping someone could give me advice on how to deal with her diplomatically? I've tried talking to her nicely...and she made up a lie to try and get me fired, I've tried discussing this with my bosses, I've exhausted almost every avenue and am just at my wits end! I can't stand going into work and seeing a dog terrified of her, or hearing her scream at them or watching as more customers listen to her and put prong collars on their dogs!

She is a complete sweetheart, very cuddly and sweet. She gets along great with my young nephews, and lived with two older dogs in her foster before we rescued her. Her training is going great. She knows sit,down, stay, leave it and heels very well. The only issue is her aggressive type behavior when we see other dogs on walks or at the vet.  I say aggressive type, because she growls and barks at the other dog but is only wanting to play with them. She cries, looks stressed, wags her tail. At the vet she has gone up to dogs that she does this too and immediately becomes calm, sniffs, sits next to them. 

The only issue I have had, is she calmly approached a smaller dog at the vets office, and it instantly snarled and bit at her face. The owner apologized and said her dog had Napoleon complex (but was sitting where all dogs would have to pass close by to exit the vet clinic). I pulled my dog back right away, and just in time because the dog became aggressive (part of me thinks is a normal reaction to a dog that bit and snarled at her, then continue to not back down).  Due to her being on a leash during these occurrences, I feel like she may be leash aggressive. I have tried to redirect her attention, give treats, make her sit. It is like her eyes are glued to the other dog.  I wonder if more socialization in some way could help, but am unsure how to go about it. "	t5_2r067	True

I want advice on how to react to her and encourage behaviors, don't need advice about potty/crate training as of yet)

1.) She knows sit. That was pretty easy and she got it around 5 weeks. Now she is starting to jump up while sitting. What do I do in this situation, if I treat her after she goes from jump to sit am I also reinforcing the jump as well?

2.) She is still not feeling the leash. But, she is 7 weeks old. What should I do to make her feel more comfortable? She's definitely making strides and can walk longer distances with out getting pissed that there is a string stopping her from doing as she pleases.

3.) She's been introduced to at least 30-40 people at this point. My fear is that when they go up to her sometimes they'll go for a squat and shell jump up to lick their face, should this behavior be discouraged? Personally I ignore jumpy behavior and praise and treat sitting, at this point even after being left alone for a few hours she walks up to me and sits when I get back.

4.) Whenever she whines and has her paw up on my bed I ignore her completely. Is this what I should be doing? She is only allowed up if I pat the bed and say come and lift her up. My bed is really low btw so she'll be able to jump right on in a week or so, but I dont want her doing that unless she is invited.

What else should I be doing?


As a side note I'm also curious as to what everyone thinks she may be mixed with. She has 4 brothers, who basically look like full yellow labs, but she looks slightly different. I've heard terrier, husky and in my opinion border collie. Her coat is short but she has these weird hairs that stick up on her face somewhat like a terrier. Also she is a buff color but has white paws. The brothers are all white-yellow lab coloring.

He gets a walk every day, he has toys, water, food, and he is given the whole apartment to roam while I am gone.

She has a 12 year old dog, and just rescued a young dog aged between 5-8 months. He was a stray, and is not trained at all. He attempts to lick the mouth of her older dog, which she knows is a sign of being willing to submit, but her older dog never dominates him. The puppy (who is fairly large - around 50 lbs) starts barking at Bear (the older dog) and Bear will growl and nip at him which sometimes causes a fight.

He isn't trained, so he does not listen to her commands (he isn't potty trained, he chases the cat, he chews, etc.) and has also bitten her (she says he's not aggressive, though, just spooks easily) but she knows this will take training. Right now, she's mostly concerned with he and her older dog not getting along. She is this dog's only chance, and could use any tips/advice anyone may have.

Note: She was lead to believe this dog was more trained than he is by the shelter, and when she tried to address that with the shelter they accused her of giving up on him too soon. That's not what she wants to do at all, as she is very serious about animals, but she's not sure what to do as she thought this dog would be a better fit for her family than he is.

Before its asked yes we tire our dogs out prior to work. I wake up at 430 am and jog with all three. They are great off leash jogging dogs. Towards the end they are struggling keeping up and start getting tired. At about 640 they are placed in the backyard. Jaina will go through the day and just dig dig dig. People tell me to bury her poop, she just goes to another spot. People say chicken wire, she goes to another spot. Balloons, bricks, ignoring the holes she goes to a new spot. We can't predict her next hole since its so random. She just loves to dig. We've made a dig box, she digs there, then next to it, then all over the yard. She gets plenty of exercise, she's well trained, stimulated, planets of toys and plays all day with our other two wearing them out to exhaustion. But each day I come home she's made a new hole somewhere. She doesn't redig the same spot. Being active military my job doesn't allow me to always come home during lunch, thus she can't be inside all day. She is kennel trained as she prefers it to no kennel. Everything is perfect with the dog, except for her huge trenches she leaves daily. Sometimes she does it within 10 minutes of being outside during potty breaks. I have tried literally every method known, water, pepper, feces, chicks wire, cement, dogbox, toys, walks, energy release, fetch, scold no, corrective leash training, high frequency dog noise, balloons, ignoring it, we had a dog trainer attempt a few things and no results. I'm hoping somewhere out there someone has figured something that no one shares and would share with me.

She is a Husky x German Shepard. They are not den digs, they are smell the ground and trench then move ten feet digs.

1 Month later: Post Mortum.

After reading many of the comments here we decided to dry a few routes. First is we adjusted her walks. I now get up pretty early, do the normal walk and they return back to the backyard for the day. We hired a teenager from down the block to make some extra money and she walks our dog daily while we are at lunch for a good hour or so, 15$ a week not bad.

After we actually rotatilled our backyard to try and kill the weeds that were growing deep. A couple of friends told us that there dog likes to dig up Rattlesnake Weeds which are like onions that attach to roots of trees. Since we have a ton of trees, we just opted to kill them all.

After the tear up , we replanted with som fresh sod on a black weed mat so that all we had was fresh grass ontop.

So far so good, we have been 6-7 days now without any dig issues. Were not sure if the smell is what is gone which is what she may have been after or the extra exercise. When we get home, she is usually happy, exhausted or expended and ready to come inside, eat and sleep for the night. She is playing well with the other dogs instead of digging now :D.

Yes I still have work to do, and no he's still not completely calmed down,  but I am so happy with the results and excited to continue with his training thanks to this silly thing. It also has so many applications including reinforcing the stay command, go to your place (I say room cause I think it's funny), and how to greet guests just to name a few. Given all the money I've spent on dog toys for distracting him, treats for rewarding him, and the time I've spent researching alternative methods this has proved to do an amazing job.

Now he stares at people when they walk by and occasionally tries to circle around and follow them, but no more barking! (Although we still do walk a bit to the side just to make sure).

But if a person talks to me, says hello, compliments me on my pup's looks, he starts barking at them. They tend to get scared and run away, and I tend to panic, apologize, and try to get his attention, which never works. I have tried getting him to sit or be calm when this happens but once he's barking he's impossible to distract, he doesn't even notice treats when they are right under his nose. He's start lunging at them and I'm worried he will bite them or nip at their heels, so working with them and trying to get them to give him treats just sounds like a bad idea to me.

First of all, I've never owned a dog before, and this subreddit and its links have been a great help in general. Thanks for that!

Anyway, on to the main problem. My wife and I adopted a 3-year old poodle mix (possibly a Maltipoo, though we're not sure) about three weeks ago, and she is overall a very sweet and well-behaved dog. However, she is very reactive to noises outside our place (we live in a townhouse complex that is largely pretty quiet). Sometimes the slightest noises will get her attention immediately and make her stare at the noise and begin growling and barking. Even ice moving around in the fridge gets her on the defensive. For some reason, kids making noise seems to be the worst (I'm dreading summertime the way things are right now).

I have tried telling her ""quiet"" firmly and then praising / rewarding when she stays quiet for a few moments. I have tried distracting her with toys / treats / etc, and getting in between her and the noise to make eye contact and reassuring her, petting her, etc. I have also (I'll admit, somewhat angrily) sent her upstairs to her kennel and kept her there for a few minutes to cool down.

While these have varying degrees of success in the moment, I can't seem to prevent the reaction to begin with. As I said, I'm very new at this and want to do the right thing, but it's very frustrating especially because she is otherwise very quiet and well-behaved.

My friend (whose dogs had the litter she comes from) has agreed to hold onto her as long as I need her to until I have everything ready for her to come home with me. 

1. I am moving in April, and I live in Los Angeles. In order for my housing options to be greater, and just general usefulness, I wanted to get her registered as a companion dog. As I understand it, companion dogs, like service dogs, are an exception to a ""no pets"" clause in a lease agreement. Does getting her certified as a companion dog allow me to move anywhere? 

2. The American Kennel Club's ""Companion Dog"" certification is called ""Canine Good Citizen."" Upon passing a test with the AKC, Selah will get a CDC certificate, and then be a registered companion dog. Is this correct? 

3. What is the age limit on getting Selah spayed and vaccinated? There is an event on the 9th that is offering free spaying's because it's ""World Spay Day"" and I would really love to get her spayed for free. Plus, the event provides free collars, leashes, microchipping, and other goodies! I think (I will call tomorrow to ask questions) if she is too young, then I will get a voucher for at least a discount on spaying if I take her to a vet.

4. Is anyone a member of the Hollywood Dog Obedience Club? If so, please PM me so I can ask you some questions about this organization.

It may be too late to fix this particular problem, but his entire life he has barked uncontrollably at the t.v. whenever he sees a dog. Or a cat. Or horse. Or mouse. Etc. He also barks/growls at cartoon animals, people dressed in animal costumes ( a la that Kia commercial), and on occasion even amphibians, reptiles, and birds. 
He's a smart dog. He now recognizes the jingles of commercials with animals (oddly, it seems like a full 90% of commercials use animals) and will come running to the t.v. even when he is in another part of the house. Recently I've discovered that he has associated the word ""Subaru"" with dogs on t.v.. When a Subaru commercial comes on, even if it doesn't have dogs, he growls.
How can we get him to stop? For more info, he is otherwise extremely well behaved with the exception of barking out the window at passersby. A while ago we tried a shock collar, which, even on the lowest setting scared him to death. We returned it because he cowered in the corner whenever we would bring it out and would pee in fear. I don't want to try that again.
Right now we just yell at him to stop and he usually does, lying down right in front of the t.v. to wait for the next offending animal. But I'd like to stop it before it starts because if we don't stop him right away he will actually jump up to the t.v. stand.

We decided to go with clicker training for Apollo, and I am excited by the research I have done so far.  I do have a few questions to make sure that we are starting off on the right foot though:

1. Is it okay to train more than one trick at once?  So far I've been working on ""sit,""  ""lay down,"" and ""touch"" with Apollo, trying to mix up the cues when we're training in order to keep it unpredictable.

1. How important is it for my boyfriend and I to balance training?  I am a student, so I have a lot more time at home than he does, and I worry that because I have more time with Apollo training/bonding, that he will not respond to my boyfriend's commands.

1. How long do you wait on a response from a cue before considering it a non-response, and how do you ""reset"" before asking again (in order to avoid just repeating yourself and becoming ineffective or training the dog to respond after several cues)?

Our Backstory:
We've fostered a few dogs over the years but could use some help here. We have a 6 year old GSD/Lab mix that is the Alpha Female of the neighborhood. Our house has 8 foot fences, a large yard and two stories. We've got more than enough room for another dog and are used to have 2-3 at a time without a problem.

His Backstory:
He was a stray in Los Angeles that was rescued and brought up to Seattle by a local shelter. He's been in a kennel/boarding with over 20 other dogs for the past 3 weeks. He's 4 years old and weighs 120lbs. He knows zero commands that we can find. His temperament is amazing. He does not have the typical GSD anxieties and gets along well with dogs of all types and sizes. He could care less about cats and is basically a big gentle giant which is what we were looking for.

Today is Day One. 

I literally just brought him home a few hours ago. 

At the kennel he showed signs of separation anxiety and is currently walking the perimeter of the house getting used to his new home. I hand fed him after giving him a tour and he's currently laying at my feet next to our other dog. 

What I'd like help with is:

-What are some tips or recommendations for helping him ease into our home?

-We have no idea what his name is and he knows no commands. I tried English/Spanish/German/French/Hand/Whistle all with no effect. Any tips for helping us get started with an untrained massive animal?

-He was ok on the car ride but couldn't hold still. I believe this is largely due to the amount of places he's been to over the past few weeks and never had any stability.

-Treats: He may just be super high strung but I've tried Peanut Butter and our normal PB/Jerky treats we use for our other dog. He doesn't seem to be food motivated yet so I'm going to give him a few days before trying out a few different treats.

-I bought him a service dog type vest with ""In training"" tags. He seems to like it and it makes moving this horse sized animal a lot easier.

-He's wearing a pheromone collar based on the recommendation from a local trainer. Since this is day one, its hard to tell if its working but after the first few hours he definitely is calming down quite a bit. He just fell asleep on the couch. 

-Any other tips or help is greatly appreciated!

There are enough of those threads all over the internet. Besides, from all my research, everyone seems to have a different story.

This is a question for all the professional trainers out there. Is dog training a full-time job or do most trainers also work on the side doing something else? I guess the real question is, can you make a decent living from dog training alone?

I do want to clarify that I am not in it for the money, if I could do it for free I would (in fact, I kind of am with some friends and family). But of course the reality is, everyone needs to pay the bills. Besides from currently having a job I loathe, I cannot begin to express the fascination I have working with dogs and seeing the smiles on people's faces when they realize their dog is capable of more than what they thought. 

I know the income depends on different things. I do live in a fairly large city, in my condo alone there are many - MANY - untrained dogs (and untrained dog owners) who I would love to help. 

Any info/advice would be plenty helpful!  "	t5_2r067	True

I have a new 11 week old Sheltie puppy that I'm attempting to train. So far, he is incredibly smart! He's got this potty training thing down. Coming from previously having dachshunds, he's a dream. But he is not food motivated. I had great success training the doxies with treats. They learned the basics: potty training, sit, come, stay; all was done with treats. 

Elwood is not interested in food. We have talked to the vet about it and have him on a diet where he will actually eat but for training I have no idea. He responds to praise but I'm at a loss on how to teach him stuff with no motivator, like food. He doesn't really come when called unless something is in it for him; he's not motivated by much, so what *that* is yet to be seen. He has favorite toys but he's not into them enough to come running to them.

1358705754.0	16xtbn	Getting a puppy soon, have a few questions I'm having trouble finding good answers for	glio	13	2	8	"- The breeder lives about 4 1/2 hours away from us. The dog will be roughly 8-9 weeks old when we picked it up. How do we get him home safely and still give him opportunities to eliminate on the way home? There are plenty of rest stops on the highways, but my concern lies with exposure to the parvo virus and other nasty things at the rest stops. Everyone in the world stops at those things and they are rife with dog waste (and human waste many times). Some of my reading has indicated that we should ask the breeder to not water/feed the puppy within a couple hours of us picking him up to help prevent the need to stop on the way back. That sounds like it could work if the travel time wasn't so long.

- As it's so important to socialize the puppy with other dogs, how do we go about that before he is done with his vaccinations? If we bring an older dog that we know is up to date on vaccines into our house, is that a safe way to let our puppy meet dogs prior to their own completion?

- How concerned should we be with taking him into our yard for eliminating before he is vaccinated? We have a small yard, no fence, but it's partially enclosed with hedges. So while it's unlikely many dogs have been in it, we can't guarantee that entirely. I'm probably being too paranoid about this stuff but I just want to double check.

Things have been going pretty good so far, he's a quick learner and listens fairly well. We crate-trained him and he is house-trained.
When we feed him, we always get him to sit and wait until we say ""okay"". For the past month or so, we've started teaching him to ""heel"" beside us before we feed him as well. We would say come, and he would usually come over and sit in front of us then we would just slide his bum over to where we wanted him and say ""heel"", then release him.
However, last week, I was going to feed him breakfast, but when I said ""come, heel"" he didn't move and just started urinating. I immediately said ""NO"" and brought him outside and told him to pee there but I had already let him out earlier so he didn't go again. I brought him back in and tried the command again, ""come, heel"", and the same thing happened, he just looked at me with his ears back and urinated. This was repeated 4 times, every time I would say ""NO"" as he was peeing and bring him outside or crate him for 5-10 minutes before trying again. I didn't know what to do anymore so I just let him eat, but he still does this every time, and also started doing it whenever I tell him to come, sit, heel or lay down, as well as whenever I reach towards him to pet him and say ""good boy"". (he does not do this with my boyfriend)
I have started ignoring him most of the time and not giving him any commands, or just ignoring that he urinates when I praise him for doing something right. Since he only does it when I'm asking him to do something, I don't want to punish him after every command I say because I feel that would be very counter-productive.

He obeys my command very well, and much better than anyone else's command. He is sort of a guard dog when we are back at my house, alone. but when i am at my parents house, he growls and nips at anyone who might be coming towards my room. my mom doesnt come upstairs because he nips at her toes and such. i always make a point to have a calm and welcoming demeanor towards anyone coming towards me or my space, so that he can see my energy and match it. however, just now, my brother was walking toward my room and domino growled ferociously and bit him on the leg (not hard, no blood. more than a 'nip' but less than a 'chomp'). my brother gave a yell and when i came out to punish domino he did as i commanded and ran away so i could put him outside. 

I like that my dog is such a good watch dog, but i don't want him to bite anyone (except maybe an intruder, but he has never met one and neither have i). How can i help him to let people into my space?

PS: i have a theory (it is only that - a theory) that domino may feel threatened by being backed into a physical dead end. my room is at the end of a hallway with no other doors and he likes to sit right at the open end of the hall, so that if my door is closed and he is not in my room, he is basically guarding a hall with no exit for him. could he be scared of being cornered? im not sure why he would because he has no reason to feel threatened by the people who enter that space.

I threw it back toward the other dog to give it back and I was  amazed that my dog went after it again. She even brought it all the way back a second time. I walked the ball over to the other owner and took my dog to the other side of the park where there were some community balls and plenty of space. She then played fetch with me for another 5 minutes before she got tired (we had been at the park for over an hour already). I kept giving her  positive reinforcements when she would get the ball and bring it back. Is there anything else I could do to keep her interest in the game?

1355327281.0	14q92z	My 8-month old Lab-Sheppard mix seems to be getting more aggressive lately. We are becoming afraid of her.	sacheltry	12	2	6	"In the past few months there were a few incidents of resource guarding, mostly with sleeping. Recently my wife went to touch her when she was sleeping and she snapped and almost got my wife. We have been trying to fix that by talking to her first and having a treat with us before we approach. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.

As far as food goes, she normally eats from a Kong and if she does eat from a bowl there have been no issues. Early on we have taken her bowl away, stuck our hands in the bowl, etc. We can also move the Kong and there aren’t issues.

We also give her marrow bones. Normally they are about the size of my hand and also there have been no issues.  This morning, I have her a much larger bone. She took it and sat where she normally sits to eat it – that is about 3 feet from the couch where my son was sitting.  My son didn’t change his position, move or anything. She just happened to notice him and started growling and barring her teeth. I walked in and she snapped at me. We were able to get it away by distracting her with some frankfurter. She searched for the bone afterwards but nothing else happened.

The other thing is her crate. She normally loves (or at least tolerates) her crate. We do keep it open and she will voluntarily go in there to sleep. We don’t bother her when she is in her crate. We want to keep it as her safe zone (as I understand is the right thing to do). Each morning when I leave for work and also at night. I put a little peanut butter or frozen food in a Kong, toss it into the crate and she will follow; I then close the door. The past couple of nights she stares at me with a pre-snarl look (or so I think), but will go in. This morning, she gave me that look, eventually went in but as I closed the door (slowly) she started growling and biting. I was able to close the door, she cried for a few seconds and then was fine.

She was at the vet early this week so there doesn’t seem to be anything physically wrong. But this behavior is very scary to us and I’m assuming, potentially dangerous. We love her and want to make sure we are doing everything correctly.

We do have a trainer, but he is not accessible 24-hours a day. He has said that we do spoil her and so the dog thinks she rules the house and can get away with this stuff. We are now going to try a little less “you are the center of our universe” around her. Meaning we still play, pet and love her, just not so much. 

Would you have any suggestions on the best way to deal with resource guarding and this newly aggressive behavior? We are concerned that if we don’t put a stop to it, she is going to hurt someone.

I adopted a [shepherd mix](http://i.imgur.com/rJZUM.jpg) (who may actually be full malinois and not a mix) when she was 8 weeks old (she's now 6 months). When we met her in the shelter she was very calm and relaxed. She walked up to greet us and let us touch her when we called, but would lay back down and go to sleep again afterwards. We thought we were getting a calm, friendly dog!

As she settled in, we could tell she is certainly not calm, and she has a lot of energy, but I can deal with that. The thing I am most worried about is her suspicious nature. I have been socializing her since the week after we brought her home (about 9 weeks). Here's some of the regular activities we do with her to socialize her:

* she's been through 11 weeks of puppy classes so far with other puppies around her age (she's a star at obedience and is the best in the class)

* she's a regular at the dog park near our house

* she's been to dog-friendly restaurants with outside seating about 6-7 times with us.

* she goes to our local dog supply stores with us

* she's been to my work a few times and met my coworkers

* she goes on daily neighborhood walks

Even so, she is very suspicious of people outside of her ""immediate family"". On neutral territory, people can walk by her and she's fine, but if they reach down to pet her it is usually met with a low growl (no snarl or ears back though). At the dog park, she is better, and will go up and sniff people, but she retreats if they try to touch her. She is much worse on her own territory, and very leash reactive. She will bark at anyone who walks past my house when she's outside, and will get very excited and try to bark/pull towards people on walks around the neighborhood. I'm afraid my neighbors are going to get terrified of her because they don't understand it is from being frightened and not aggression. 

I've been working with her on the leash reactivity daily, and she seems to be improving little-by-little, but there are good and bad days. I try to get her on the opposite side of the street from the ""trigger"" and then reward calm behavior/talk to her and stroke her to calm her. I try to restrain her from pulling with my body so she doesn't feel any leash pressure (she also uses an easy walk). 

Sometimes I just feel very sad and discouraged that my dog will never be thought of as a ""good dog"" by the outside world, and I'll never have a friendly dog who will be comfortable around other people.

Our seven month old puggle, Lola, is coming around quite nicely.  She is 95% potty trained (has the occasional accident when very anxious, excited, or nervous) and is starting to grow out of some of her puppyhood mischief-making.  Last week I wanted to see how she would act if let into the bedroom, an area of the house off limits prior.

Well, it was a disaster.  For some reason I didn't think it would be as bad as it was, but she grabbed everything in sight; underwear, socks, pillows, you name it.  Even after I cleaned everything up, she was discovering articles of clothing and other more dangerous things (fiancee's hair ties and bobby pins) that I hadn't even noticed were there.

Finally I had cleaned everything.  At this point she started whining at the hamper, which contained all of the dirty clothes I had cleaned up.  This continued for about five minutes, during which she became increasingly anxious and upset, ending with her peeing on the floor (something she hadn't done in at least three weeks).  Needless to say, I was all sorts of frustrated and distraught.  It's been five months that I haven't been able to use my computer while she is awake, because it is in the bedroom.  I was kind of hoping to have that luxury back.

How do I get her to act properly in the bedroom? I tried getting her to sit or lie down and give her treats the longer she stays in that position, but her drive for undies always wins out eventually and I have to drag her out from under the bed.

1350560189.0	11oni4	My dog will not give me any personal space, often to her own discomfort.		15	4	28	"Hey!

So I've had this dog since she was a puppy. She was separated from her mom too young and the man who gave her to me failed to mention she was extremely sick. In fact, she had Parvo (survival rates for puppies with parvo is low, but she pulled through).

So during her first few weeks of life she was carted around from hospital to hospital. The only thing that was constant was my presence. I stayed with her till the vet closed. Took time off work and school to be with her while she was sick.

So I understand that she's attached to me, I am to her also, but it's getting bad.

I'll often be doing something like studying, or watching a movie, and she'll just be sitting and staring. If I send her off to go play, she comes back and sits right under the table (she's too big to fit, so you can tell she's uncomfy, but she keeps coming back).

If she's asleep and I get up to go use the toilet, shut the window, or just stretch, she will wake up and stare. She only sleeps when I leave the house, or when I sleep.

She *always* wants to be in bed with me. Even though I kick in my sleep and often kick her accidentally. I feel bad for doing it so I remedy this by having her sleep away from my legs.

She doesn't have the classic symptoms of Separation Anxiety. She never barks or cries when I go to work or school. She doesn't destroy things or urinate/defecate in the house.

My bedroom is tiny but she will not go play out in the living room unless I relocate there myself.

So how do I inspire her to be more independent and not hover around me constantly? 

tl;dr: Dog is very attached, wont be in another room without me, follows me everywhere, stares a lot, always wakes up if I move around."	t5_2r067	True
1350257238.0	11hf6b	Dog is very anxious, chews up everything, and makes it miserable for everyone when we go to the dog park. It's getting worse. Please help?	Angelfish19	12	1	14	"I got my 2-year-old dog back in May. I live in an apartment, just me and him. Everything was fine for several months and he behaved well, but back in about early September things started to go downhill (pretty fast). 
At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. If you have any advice or insight, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I should add that I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with him mentally/socially, but I don't know what. I think most of his problems probably stem from bad anxiety, but I don't think that's it. He's compulsive. He's also pretty single-minded, even for a dog. He doesn't understand simple things that my previous dogs got easily. He doesn't get normal doggy social cues. 

Anyway, he seems to have a big problem with separation anxiety. He whines for several minutes after every time I leave (he sounds like someone is beating him), and lately he's even been shivering pathetically as I walk out the door. 
He used to have no problem going in his kennel before I left. Now when I stand by it he'll go to the door with his tail between his legs. It takes several calls for him to come back, and he still goes in reluctantly, even though he knows I always give him a treat when he goes in. I know he has no problem with the kennel itself, just with me leaving.

Since we live in a small apartment, going to the dog park is a necessity. He used to be ok there, but now he's just awful. He barks continuously. Mostly at dogs, but also at people sometimes. He's never aggressive about it, but he seems to think he HAS to bark to play with them. His bark is really loud, and it really is just CONTINUOUS. It's so annoying and disruptive and I always feel bad that I can't control him, but he HAS to be able to run around somewhere. 
Sometimes he fixates on a dog that doesn't want to play with him. There are 20 other dogs to play with, but he has to hound that particular one. He'll follow them around and herd them in different directions, barking in their face the whole time. Eventually of course, they get mad at him. And he doesn't seem to understand that they are mad at him. So the other dog ends up snarling and snapping at him, and the dog's owner gets upset. Even if I drag him away and hold him back for a while or try to get him to play with other dogs, he'll make a beeline back to the first dog as soon as he can. 
I can't get to him in time to correct him while we're there because the park is big and he's too fast. He completely ignores me while we're there, and doesn't want anything to do with me. I always have to chase him down when we leave. 

He also chews on everything. I make sure he always has toys to chew on: he has a Kong, tennis balls, ropes, and bones. He shreds all of those but the Kong, but still chews on just about anything else. 
He chews on the usual clothes and shoe targets, but also his bed, blankets in his kennel (not while he was closed in the kennel, though), pens, books, bags, and all kinds of plastic things. Yesterday he managed to chew half of the drawstring off a hoodie that was hanging up without damaging the rest of it. I've even caught him chewing on the corners of walls, tables, and desks. 
The most worrying thing was the other day, when I found the razor from my shower in pieces across the floor. I'm amazed there wasn't blood everywhere. 
He's very sneaky while he does all of this. He doesn't make a sound. 
And for some reason, he doesn't do this while has free reign of the apartment at night. He does it while I take a shower, or when I take a nap during the day, or even when I'm on the computer. I've started trying to put him in his kennel while I take a shower or nap, but he's already in his kennel while I'm gone most of the day so I don't really want to do that.
Aside from all the time, money, and frustration this causes, I'm also afraid he will chew on a wire or get a hold of something that will really hurt him. 


Sorry for the long post but I am just about at the end of what I can handle on my own here. Please share anything you think may help.


**TL;DR:** My main problems are these: 

* He has major separation anxiety. 

* He chews up anything and everything, to the point where I'm worried he'll hurt himself somehow. 

* He will not shut up if there is another dog anywhere nearby, and going to the dog park is a nightmare. 

* He doesn't behave very well around dogs and he doesn't respond much to normal doggy social cues (like the other dog telling him ""that's enough"" or ""let's play"" or ""stop that"" or even ""back the fuck up or I'll bite you""). "	t5_2r067	True
1349648466.0	113v18	Fearful dog being shouted at -- how to approach owners?	surf_wax	15	4	4	"This is more a question about humans than dogs.

I live downstairs from my (female) landlord and her 10-year-old son in a separate apartment.  A year or so ago, her boyfriend moved in, and maybe six months after that, she got a Chihuahua from the local shelter.

The boyfriend didn't want a dog.  He told me this before they got it, and asked me not to tell her.  I thought this was a bad idea, but stupid me, I fucking listened to him and didn't say anything.  So a few days after I hear this, they bring home a freshly-neutered adult Chihuahua, the kid's in love, everything's great.

Except it's not.  The boyfriend was unemployed at the time and wound up being the person staying at home with the dog.  And based on the dog's behavior, we suspect that it was abused by men.  It's afraid of the boyfriend.  It lost its shit when he walked into the house carrying a bunch of dowels one day, apparently.  It will curl up in his shirt and go to sleep, but it will also yelp in terror, refuses to allow him to walk it unless the landlord or her son is there, cowers, etc.  The boyfriend is apparently hurt that the dog doesn't like him, and doesn't seem to understand that's it's a dog, its brain is the size of a walnut, it's been abused, it's not personal.  He leans over and picks it up, he gives it a bath rather than letting the landlord do it, he doesn't seem to think about the things he does that might cause the dog to react badly to him.  So there's a massive amount of frustration here, and the boyfriend is reacting angrily to these behaviors.

I am sitting down here listening to the dog yelping, and the boyfriend reacting by shouting and making loud noises.  He is very angry and the dog sounds fucking terrified.  And I'm thinking, no fucking wonder the dog's afraid of you.  This is like listening to a big angry man shouting at a previously-abused three-year-old because it won't stop crying.  The landlord and I are pretty sure he's not hurting the dog, but at this point, does it matter?  It's abuse either way.

I don't know what to do.  Clearly it was a bad idea for them to get this dog, but I don't think they're going to give it up.  I don't think the boyfriend is going to get kicked out, either, though I wouldn't cry if he did, not at this point.  Next time I hear it I'm going to ask him to send the dog outside so I can let it in and it can hang with me for awhile, but this isn't a good solution long-term; it doesn't solve the problem, and I'm going to be getting my own dog in January or February, so the last thing I need is a territorial Chihuahua randomly visiting my house.  I can talk to them about fear response, incentive-based training, etc., give them my copy of Don't Shoot the Dog, but that requires the boyfriend to be a willing participant and not lose his temper.  Which he apparently has no problem doing.  He was home alone with the dog last weekend and told the landlord, ""Surf_wax probably thinks I'm hitting the dog.""

How the hell do I approach this with these people?  The landlord is reasonable.  I've talked to her about this before, but I just don't think she gets how bad it is, and I don't know how to bring it up again.  If we didn't have a business relationship, it would be one thing, but even though I'm comfortable with her, I feel like I have to tread lightly.

tl;dr - Listening to animal being abused by landlord's SO, doubtful physical harm, unsure how to make it stop.

UPDATE:  I got a quote from a local dog trainer, but this morning things blew up a little.  I get federal holidays off, so I was home, and I don't think the boyfriend knew.  I woke up to yelping, stomping directly over my bedroom, big-angry-guy shouting, and after I recorded some of it, I texted him and told him to let the dog out so I could watch him until my landlord got home.  No answer, so I texted her, and she asked me to go up there and get him.  The boyfriend told me he was sorry after I'd let the dog out, and I didn't answer.  I was pretty angry.  Now my landlord and I are emailing back and forth, and I've got a name of a local trainer to give her, a recommendation that she do that instead of obedience class, and I will be giving her that copy of Don't Shoot the Dog when I see her tonight or tomorrow morning.

Ugh.  Thank you, everyone.  Hopefully this puts them toward some kind of happy solution for the dog."	t5_2r067	True
