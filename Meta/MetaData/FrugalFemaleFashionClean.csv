1355155926.0	14lxcz	I love Modcloth, but not always the prices....I found something similar for a few $ cheaper.  :)	lalala_meh	84	9	33	"Okay, so I love Modcloth and everything they sell.  I've made at least 8 orders in the last year that are at least $50 for the free shipping.  I stalk their site in case anything I love goes on sale and to snag something before they are out of stock.  Anyway....so point is I LOVE them, but I don't always love the price tag.  Even if I can save a few bucks, I'm happy.  So if you love some of their items, I came across a different site that is the same style as Mod, but just a few $$$ less.  Granted, not a HUGE discount, but I saved $18 on a dress that would've cost me $60 at Mod.  AND I got that dress in 3 days from the date of order.  

I swear I'm not affiliated with the site, but I think it's something worth sharing especially for you ladies who are like me.  I'll still remain faithful to Mod since they do have many more items than Lace Affair and decent prices, but I'm glad I found another site with the similar style for almost the same price.  Happy shopping!

1376489659.0	1kck9c	New website with deals based off actual price changes. Would love your feedback!	notmymiddlename	40	2	14	"I've been working on a website called [Connoissumer](http://connoissumer.com) that helps people save money by tracking actual price changes of items, and letting you them know about it when the price decreases. So many retailers seem to use some sort of price anchoring (say it's on sale, but really the sale price is the normal price) or coupon codes to try to get impulse buyers, so the idea is to be a wish list and deal web app that will try to see through those shenanigans, and let people know about actual price fluxtuations and actual sales.

The way it works is you can save items that are already on Connoissumer, or submit new things that you find while you shop online and they'll be added to your wish list. Once on your wish list, the site will go and look at the price over and over again and let you know if it decreases.

I started to put the site online in July, and I've made a lot of improvements but it still has a long ways to go. I was hoping for some more feedback to find out what is good or bad about the site and then also which stores are or arn't working so I can fix the broken ones. Above all I really just want to hear what people think, if they think this site could be useful, and what I can do to improve it so it can save more people more money (mo' problems?)."	t5_2tnuv	True

1331819522.0	qxret	Let's Talk About Frugality	higgyskiggy	36	5	21	"F cubed, first of all, I would like to thank ALL of you for contributing and subscribing to FFF. I really believe that fashion can exist on every budget, you just have to know how to shop. That being said, I would like for all of us to really define *frugality*. I think that really developing what is frugal for you individually and sticking to it benefits not only your wardrobe but all that you buy. **Here are some of my own personal guidelines to start the discussion:**

* **Frugal vs. Cheap**. Scenario: you find a pair of jeans for $12. However, they are 50% spandex and the fabric is thin. In the same store, you find another pair of jeans for $24. These jeans have 3% spandex, and are much heavier weight. Which do you choose? You could get two pairs of the first jeans for the price of one pair of the second. This may seem frugal at first, because you are getting double the product for the same price. But long term, this is a financially poor choice. The lower quality jeans will probably only last two or three seasons. The better quality can last you 5+ years. Once you start thinking of your clothing as investments it's much easier to buy less clothing, knowing that each item will have a longer lifetime. 
* **Determining the Quality of what you Buy** Now that you have decided to buy less and longer term, how do you determine WHAT to buy? In stores, this is pretty easy. Looking at and physically inspecting a garment usually gives you a good idea. This can get tricky online. I try to keep track of materials that last and work well on my body. For example, I would buy a pair of genuine leather pumps online for up to $55, but I would never buy PVC or synthetic online. In my experience, cotton, cotton blends, leather, silk, satin, modal and and rayon are quality fabrics that generally have the same integrity from store to store. Polyester and PVC are big no-no's in my book, both are super shiny, cheap and costumey, and usually make me look like a stripper. However, I will all materials a chance in store because I can physically evaluate each item. To get started, check out your wardrobe, and mentally divide it into two categories: items that have lasted a long time or are extremely flattering and items that maybe look awkward or worn. Now check the labels. What is flattering for you should generally be made of the same fabrics. Keep these in mind for online. On the other hand, if you find a consistent fabric that is not really working for you, avoid it like the plague.
* **Trendy vs. Classic** I understand that not everyone dresses like Calvin Klein. But there are some basic items that *every* woman has/needs in her wardrobe. Examples: dress shoes, dressy dress, interview wear, outerwear, and one solid bag. I don't care if you dress like Anna Wintour or Kristen Stewart, you are going to need a coat, some shoes appropriate for an interview, and a place to keep all your crap in (even if it's just your keys, phone and wallet). Just because they are ""classic"" pieces doesn't mean it can't be your style. Because these items are something you want to last a good few years (I mean, you will need them most likely the rest of your life), please consider your budget. Now double it for these particular items. I'm not saying you HAVE to spend $100 on a pair of shoes, but be prepared to spend that much. Now find a $100 pair of shoes for $50. That's being frugal: you know it's worth more than you would ever spend, but you found it at a great deal! And long term, its going to cost you less to buy a $70 trench coat now, and then not needing to buy another for the next 7 years. On the flip side, trendy items should be CHEAP. You heard me. This is the only time when it is logical to be cheap and buy low quality. Really digging those feather earrings? Get your butt to Forever21 and buy a pair for $3. We all know they won't be in style in the next 3 years. But they are hot right now, and you only need them to last short term. This also applies when trying out new styles. Used to be a punk but now you want to lean towards a indie look? Start out at a cheap store like Forever21 or Wet Seal. Get your look together for cheap, then if you want to stick with this style go start investing on similar quality pieces. 
* On a **final note**, I don't want to come off as snobby or self righteous about fashion. Frugal fashion is a new revelation for me, only a year ago I only bought cheap stuff season to season. A good friend intervened, and I dress better, look better, and year to year spend *less* on clothing. I understand some of you are on super tight budgets. So get what you need now, and take baby steps. Maybe it will take you four months to save up for that trench coat or leather pumps. So be it. There  is no shame in taking your time building your wardrobe. You will make better decisions on what you need to buy and most likely score better deals when you really take the time and effort to spend and splurge. **We can ALL own a $400 purse. Frugal ladies are just smarter and can find it for $60 ;)**"	t5_2tnuv	True

1336975795.0	tm3nq	Love those adorable Twistband hairties but don't want to drop $10 on ONLY 6 o 'em? Have I got a solution for you!	monolithica	20	1	19	"Just sharing a quick little tip to everyone! I recently got a [twistband hairtie](http://www.thetwistband.com/) in my most recent birchbox! for the uninitiated, it's a wonderful piece of elastic that doesn't leave dents in your hair but it does an amazing job of keeping everything where it's supposed to be. 

I'm in love with this thing, and have not taken it off basically since I got it! However, I was not going to blow $10 + shipping on only six friggin' ties, so I went looking for alternatives. 

I found that elastic ribbon is dirt cheap. I found it for as low as $0.49 a yard! (plus $2 some change shipping) So, we’ll round up to even $4 total cost for 12 ties, and you want to charge me $10…for…not even nice packaging? Nooo thank you. So my checkout total for 5 yards and shipping was less than $6. That's THIRTY hairties! (figuring each one is about 6 inches long)

It requires some DIY (but not really, you just have to cut it and knot it!) but for me, this is an amazing deal for the same product. 

If you're feeling lazier than that, you can get some cheaper ones off of Etsy, which I ordered first without realizing I could buy the ribbon by the yard! Oh well! 

Sorry if this was too long, I got really excited about finding this stuff so cheap! 

EDIT: I bought my ribbon from [HERE](http://www.kayboutique.com/wholesale-girls/supplies/elastic-yard), there are some patterns and then the last option has multiple color options as well. Also try searching ""fold over elastic"" too.

**EDIT 2:** I just got my elastic today, and I made **22 hair ties** and **3 headbands** out of just 6 yards of elastic. For under $6 (with shipping!)! They may not hold up as long as typical hair elastics, but honestly, for this price, *who cares?* :) 

And a tip for those who are making them- take a light and melt the edges so it doesn't fray. :) "	t5_2tnuv	True

The site allows for free shipping/returns, so you can try on clothes, and send them back if you don't like them.

1) LOFT. While they do the occasional 40-50% the entire store, they also regularly add on an additional 30-50% on their sale items. Depending on the location, the sale items can be fantastic! I think the stuff is originally overpriced, but they make up on it with their specials. 

They do these $25 off your purchase of $50 cards, two of which I got on Black Friday when the entire store was 50% off. They can be used on all items expect sale, so I was still able to use them on the $30 off all chords deal they had, AND the already 40% off all tops/sweaters. The best part? They give you a sticker on each card so you can use them again! And they are giving out 20% coupons if you donate at least $1 to St. Judes. 

2) Madewell. I love everything Madewell (especially their shoes!), but their original prices are ridiculous. So not only do I use the 15% off for students, but I also wait until their sale items are an additional 30-35% off. They let you use the 15% on top of the additional sale percentage, which has allowed me to get some amazing pieces.

ItDoesntDoWood	16	2	8	"So, recently I've come to the conclusion that not only do I want to be more comfortable in skirts and dresses, I actually want to wear them more often. But, I need some help finding cute skirts and dresses for cheap(or at least kind of cheap). My hips are kind of wide(at about 42 inches last time I checked), so I have to shop in the plus sizes at most places and that tends to get expensive. 

Anyway, if you girls have any ideas for places I could try that would be lovely! Also, any tips on feeling comfortable in a skirt are appreciated too. =D

1353009553.0	1398c6	Advice for a truly frugal wardrobe? How many clothes does a person need, really?	tehsophz	20	7	8	"While I can see this sub is mostly for finding deals on fasion, I have found that bargain-hunting had a very counter-productive effect on my finances (they're on sale, so I can buy more of them!). I've been thinking of instead paring down my wardrobe to a limited number of quality items that I truly love. I know I can pack light just fine, so I don't need that many clothes. What do you ladies suggest for an amount of clothing to have per season, considering:

- I work an office job, where I dress business casual (can't be in jeans and an Iron Maiden shirt, but I still don't need a full pantsuit every day)
- My hobbies include a lot of fitnessy/outdoor stuff: running, yoga, hiking etc
- I do go out every now and then to concerts/pubs, but have been doing so less and less recently. I do tend to hang with friends a few times a week in casual settings (ie each other's houses, occasionally going for coffee/dinner, etc)
-I have a washer and dryer at home, so access to laundry is not an issue. I'd be perfectly okay doing laundry weekly. 
-I live in a fairly extreme, unpredictable climate (goes up to 30 celcius in the summer, -40 in the winter), so I need different warmth levels of outerwear.

How many of each article of clothing is enough for somebody with my lifestyle?

However, a recent injury to my right hip has me in doctor ordered skirts until the hematoma heals and quite frankly, I'm a lot more comfortable in them than I thought I would be. I have a few skirts and dresses but not nearly enough for variation during the work week. So this is my dilemma, I need some inexpensive pieces that I can purchase quickly. I'll invest in some better ones when I have the money.

I work in a business casual environment and my style tends toward classic/retro clothing. For example, I recently purchased this dress from Mode Merr. I have an hour glass figure if that matters for suggestions and I verge on petite, I'm 5'5"" and wear between and 8 and a 12. I also live in the Pacific Northwest, so I'm not looking for anything very short or lightweight. Tights and leggings have been my friend for the past few weeks.

My plan has been to TJ Maxx, Marshalls and some thrift stores along with H &amp; M but I'd love some other suggestions. Thanks!

I just realized how god-awful my wardrobe is, at least as far as tops and blouses go. Everything is bland or a baggy hot mess. I just bought some really cute skirts and pants and literally have nothing to wear with them.

I also live by a nice outlet mall with J. Crew, Banana Republic, and Off 5th. I have so much trouble with fitted/stylized clothes, though!

And about me: I'm 5'5"", about 150 lbs (ugh), and pear-shaped. I tend to go medium on top, 10s for bottoms. Not that you really need to know for tops, but my problem areas are probably my stomach, hips, and ass.

skinny jeans are alright, but i'd also like some variation in fit, since all my pants seem to be of the skinny variety.

i live in an area pretty close to a lot of stuff, so there's no shortages of stores, though i couldn't tell you what stores are around exactly.

There are two deals that you can stack on top of each other.

$15 off $30:
http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2?aid=1385098083&amp;a=0&amp;n=72&amp;CUSTOM_2=10152467438&amp;om_rid=NslhgV&amp;om_mid=_BPXdhfB8hRMgfe

$25 virtual dollars:
For every $50 you spend in store before Apr 10, you get $25 virtual dollars that you can spend again.


So you can shop thrice for $30, each time applying the $15 discount, so you have spent $45. If you spend just $5 more the total becomes $50 and you get $25 virtual discount.

So now you have spent $50, and bought merchandise worth 3 x 30 + 5 + 25 = 120, which is a savings of around 60%.

I just recently graduated college and have never had a ""real"" job, so I pretty much have no professional clothing. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. I've actually had no problem finding cheap dress pants/skirts at places like Ross, JC Penney, etc, but I'm having a real issue with cheapish shoes and tops.

I am slightly picky and I can't really describe my taste, but at this point I'm really just looking for cheap and professional. Nothing crazy nice - just stuff that would be considered business casual or a little nicer.

Anyone have any ideas on where I should look for shoes and tops? My time is running out ;( Normally I wouldn't care about being so frugal, but getting this job has already cost me a lot of money so I don't have a lot more to spend.

If it helps at all: I'm 5'8"", around 140, and wear a size 8.5-9 in shoes. 

Thanks in advance guys!

Sure! 

Flats or low heels. I'm not coordinated enough to walk in high heels, haha!

I'm kind of tall with a long torso and I have a large butt/hips and chest. I'm something more like a cross between hourglass and pear shape. I find it very hard to find clothes. Most shirts are short, ending up way too short on me; or the fit is poor because my chest is about to break open from the shirt. Usually, I need to wear a huge and extremely baggy pants size to get my butt to fit. I have a pretty flat stomach, so if I buy a shirt that fits the top half of me, the bottom is usually very baggy or loose.

Is there any stores that target this kind of body shape more?

I also like wearing less girly clothes... I wear a lot of skirts and I like dresses, but I like wearing leather, things with studs, camo, lots of tank tops, and I like the 90s/00s hoodies. I find women's hoodies this year to be thin cotton or knit material and in pastels - not what I am looking for.

It occurred to me that maybe a swap on here was possible? Most of the shoes I end up not wearing are because they're slightly to small or the heel ended up too high for me, so always gently worn.

$70 GAP jeans? Seam came out in &lt;6 months.

$60 Express columnist pants? Hem came out in THE FIRST WASH. This is the second pair that has done this.

Here is my ideal pair of pants for work:

* Skinny (not skin-tight, maybe more cigarette like)
* Looks good with flats (no flare leg)
* Made of durable but flexible material (something I could ride a bike in)
* NORMAL rise (none of this 2002 low-rise muffin-top hip-hugging crap)
* Comes in black, gray, khaki, etc.

If I could find some comfortable cotton pants with just a little bit of spandex for stretch and a slim pant-leg, that would be ideal. If I could just take those $10 F21 jeans and turn them into non-denim business-safe colors, that would also be ideal. As long as they're cheap, I don't care if they fall apart. I'll buy them by the dozen.

If you've heard of something near my ideal, please let me know.

After posting [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/17f24j/help_what_should_i_wear_to_meet_the_boyfriends/) in a bit of nervous wreck mode last night, I have returned somewhat triumphant.

[Here is an album of my current wardrobe.](http://imgur.com/a/0lsDK#0)  I'll apologize right off the bat for not taking a picture of myself in everything I own, but I have provided two pictures of myself wearing clothing in the album!

I'm just at a loss!  I'm afraid to default to my usual, *""I don't know what to wear; black shirt, jeans, ""Converse,"" and scarf it is,""* mentality.  

**Backstory**
I've been losing weight for almost two years, and though I've hit a big plateau, I'm poor and can't afford to spend money on things I don't need or that won't fit for long.  Most of what you see came from free piles in my dorm, thrift stores, garage sales, and friends.  A few pieces came from T.J. Maxx, etc., or super reduced online sales (Cabela's cargo pants before I went to Turkey).  In addition, weight loss changed my feet, which is why my shoe selection is so dire.  I have a couple other pairs (Nike cross trainers, brown heels...), but not many.

I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl.  My boyfriend usually is, too, though he wears plaid to work every day (engineer stereotype, says he) and has recently begun to wear solid color sweaters in muted tones.

**Setting**
We'll be meeting them for breakfast at a casual dining restaurant next Saturday morning.  I want to make a good impression (I don't know what kind of impression I made in their passers-by impressions of me a few years ago in high school!).  I'm hopelessly in love with their son, after all!

Anyway, thank you for any and all help you can give!

TL;DR:  HELP!

**EDIT** :  I have assembled pictures of myself IN outfits.  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/17piyj/possible_ensembles_for_meeting_boyfriends_parents/) is my new FFF thread and [here](http://imgur.com/a/FLKKN#0) is the new album.

Semisonic	11	1	5	"My girlfriend needs a new purse after years of buying cute but poorly made junk that falls apart within a year or two.  I'm thinking about picking her up something for Christmas.

I'd like to get her something solid with classic good looks that will last longer.  Hopefully it'll become a much-loved accessory she can mix and match with different outfits.  

I was thinking about [a small tote from SBL](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Tote-Bag?sc=8&amp;category=301418), but I'm open to options.  I already have several of their pieces and am a big fan.  But ~$400 *is* pretty steep.  

Open to suggestions re: fabric.  Probably looking for something in a brown if we go leather.  Bigger than a clutch, but not big enough to put a laptop in.

If you have one that's over $40, that's fine, but I probably wouldn't be interested in combat boots for more than $60...

It seems that the garter belt will very quickly destroy this part. My second problem is that I have huge legs. I hate shopping for any kind of leggings because they are generally measured by body weight only, and I have the legs of a much heavier woman than I am. And since you generally can't return these articles of clothing, it has become a frustrating nightmare to try and find any. I found a pair at Torrid which fit pretty well but which have the plastic welt at the top, but using them with the garter belt three times has already ruined the lace at the top of one leg, AND has run to boot.

My big question is whether J. crew stuff goes on sale (either online or in stores), or whether they have discounts/deals like Express always seems to be having.

TWO QUESTIONS:


1. I have a beautiful 65% cotton/35% polyester sweater with a lace collar that used to be white, until I washed it with dark colours and totally fucked up its pristine look. It is now a dirty off white and I'd like to dye it purple or royal blue. 

Has anyone had experience with this? Any advice on clothing dyes? Can I do this in a pail, as I cannot risk staining my clawfoot bathtub? 

2.I also have a powder blue mid-calf length coat similar to [this](http://www.wellheeledblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jcrewladyday.jpg) that I fetched out of the free  bin outside a vintage shop. It has what looks like rust stains dotting the sleeves and as much as I LOVE the light colour I think I will need to dye it dark to make it wearable. It is really well made and has a cream lining. Can I do this myself or is this a job for a professional? I don't mind paying to make it look good since I got it for free. 

Thanks in advance!"	t5_2tnuv	True

I've checked Target and TJMaxx and Nordstrom Rack, but everything seems to have switched to flip flops and bathing suits or is still really expensive (Nordstrom Rack had some things that were on sale, but still well over 100). I'm not looking to spend a lot. I figured since it's the end of the season, I'd be able to find some for around $50. Everything online still seems to be in the $100 range, though!

Conference) that Are Still a Little Sexy and 
Feminine. Budget-Minded is Best! (x-post from /r/
femalefashionadvice)"	2Cuil4School	7	2	0	"Posting on behalf of the lady-friend as she scrambles to get her poster presentations and datasets in order :)

We've knocked out her suits for presentation days (two conferences back to back) and semi-formal conservative wear for the days she's not personally giving talks but will still be around, but now it's time to think of ideas for her evening wear!

We're looking for 1-2 dresses that wouldn't be wildly inappropriate to wear around academic luminaries in your field but are still feminine and sexy enough to fit in with the younger crowds and look her best in.

She stands 5'9"" and weighs 125-130 (conference stress could leave her anywhere between those two). Her measurements are 34C/26.5/37.5 with somewhat broad shoulders and particularly long legs (inseam length when accounting for heels is nearly 34""). She'll be in the American midwest, so temperatures will be definitively cool, especially since this for evening dinners/dances.

She generally shies away from loosely fitted peasant tops, earth tones, and floor-length dresses/skirts. She harbors a love for colorblock designs, bodycon cuts, and ""funky elements"" (a bright color or unusual cut). She also loves interesting patterns (there were some almost Day-of-the-Dead-esque items she eyed a lot this summer) and cute touches (like bows and ""sailor-esque"" collars).

She tends to wear a lot of black and red already, so if the items weren't in those colors, it'd be nice for purposes of wardrobe expansion, but then again, I understand that she can't be too absurdly bold in front of some of the older professors.

In terms of outfit-completers, she already has: 

* Several cardigans and low-cut sweaters that could be worn over a dress (black, cream, grey-and-red, maybe a couple other colors)

* Black leather calf-high boots with buckles, brown suede boots with some small tassles, brown leather boots in a non-aggressive biker style

* Three pairs of 3-4"" heels (brown suede pumps with a wrap-over strap over the foot with a small button; dark purple suede pumps, and black patent leather slingbacks with a pointed toe)

* Several pairs of black flats, from Mary Janes to pointy black slingbacks

* Various colors of tights and leggings--blacks and dark browns in tights, burgundy (patterned), grey (patterned), and black in leggings (plus funkier colors like yellow). She also has fishnets in black and teal

* A small selection of belts including a wide black belt with chrome hoop-style buckle, thin black and brown belts, and a very broad brown ""woven"" (looks sort of like dark straw or espadrille ) belt

----------

Sorry if that is a massive overabundance of information, but time is short and I am not *nearly* fashionable enough to explore the vast world of women's dresses on my own!

Our ideal budget would be something on the order of $80-100 at absolute most, so if there's a phenomenal $70 dress out there that her accessories/shoes could turn into two different outfits (the nights in question will be several days apart), and it's better than two $30 dresses, then we can handle that."	t5_2tnuv	True
1349880150.0	1194ok	Well made wrap dresses for less?	pcversusmac	4	0	1	"I need to improve my work wardrobe on a budget, but I'm not willing to sacrifice quality. I love the wrap dresses from Old Navy, but the material is thin and cheap. I know these won't last very long in the wash, so I'm searching for dresses similar to these with better quality. This is sort of a frugal/""buy it for life"" situation.  I would like whatever I purchase to be very well made and at a reasonable price (under $50). I'm willing to shop online and any sales or coupons will definitely sweeten the deal.

I've tried looking at cheap women's fashion websites and the ones under 20 are not what I'm looking for (in other words, ugly). I'm always keeping my eye out at forever 21 but the few they have are way too pricey (40+). I just want to know if there is such thing as a big cheap purse. I don't even bother with Value Village/Goodwill anymore because if they do have something I'd wear, the price is pretty close to one that's brand new! I might as well buy a new one that I love! Brands are NOT important to me at all. I just want to look cute for a lot less!

A couple styles I'm interested in:
 
*a cross body

*has a long strap and also 2 small handles on the bag 

*a bag that's long enough to fold in half and zips open at the top. (The top half of the bag folds down and clips to the bottom half)

(I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to add photos with it :/)

I searched and searched but couldn't find anything like it! So that's how our journey started. I created the site so that my wife could easily find fresh deals from our favorites stores. Then I realized that other people would probably want to use the site too.
Let me know what you think.  Is the site easy to use? Is there something that's confusing?  Aslo if there're some stores that you think I'm missing, please let us know and we'll try to incorporate their products...  any feedback would be appreciated.  Thanks."	t5_2tnuv	True

I had been buying shirts from Target, as the Merona brand is inexpensive and the tees look awesome on me.  However, after just 6 months to a year of wear, they're either stretched out (I have a XS that looks like a L now) or somehow I have little holes in the tummy area of a handful of my shirts.  Most of my shirts are stretchy cotton and looks like something chewed it; I also had some rayon shirts that the same thing happened to--is this a washing machine issue? I have a top-loading HE washer and I hang-dry my rayon stuff. 

 I have about $100 and am ready to purchase a few new quality tops.  I just need to know what stores and brands would be best.  I'd of course like them to be fashionable and make me look sophisticated (I'm 28 and don't mind looking the part).

I also love the ease of dresses, but the big stipulation is that I have to be able to nurse my baby in them (and subsequent babies, as I plan on having at least one or 2 more babies in the next 10 years).  I have a few zip-up and pullover dresses that I love but can't really wear for this entire year unless it's for something special.  Button-up things are good, but I have no time to iron them.  The best dress I have for nursing is actually a maternity dress from Target that still looks good on me post-baby.  It has an overlapping v-neck that's easy to pull aside.  I wear it probably too much.

I'm willing to go to thrift stores, but I still need to know what brands are high quality and will last.

1368917736.0	1eln4q	What is your favorite store to buy cheap but durable slacks from?	Lucky1289	1	0	0	"Hello r/frugalfemalefashion!

In a few weeks I start a summer practicum at a local substance abuse facility. I have not visited this particular location before, but when I went to turn in my forms at their main office I noticed that everyone was dressed in very nice business casual type clothing - slacks, cardigans, cute blouses/tops, etc. I'm going to follow up with my supervisor, but I have a feeling that my location will follow a similar dress code. I have the cardigans, flats, and cute tops covered, but I don't own any slacks. 

Where can I find a few cheap but durable pairs, preferably online? My practicum will only span about 2-3 days a week for about 6 weeks so they don't need to last a ridiculously long amount of time, but ones that don't fall apart after one washing would rock.

Likewise, is there such a thing as business casual capri or capri-length pants? "	t5_2tnuv	True

http://www.etsy.com/listing/103844984/couture-white-ostrich-feather-skirt

but it is QUITE expensive. I should probably go for fake feathers, seeing as I am not trying to make anything super fancy, just something fun to wear.

My apologies if this is an inappropriate place to post this! 

I have some clothing and shoes (former shoe addict) and I am looking for the most efficient way of doing this. Everything I'm selling is in good condition - a lot of it never worn, and the quality ranges from your typical Aldo fare to a couple of Fluevog pieces.

I am not int the business of reselling constantly so I don't want to set up an ebay store. This is just a one time deal. 

My ideas so far are to just have a garage sale and do some advertising on craigslist - does anyone have any better ideas? 

Thanks in advance!

1368152479.0	1e1lqr	I got a ton of clothes for free from a local clothes swap!	yannburger	1	0	0	"Here is what I got: http://imgur.com/a/RjFdP
I don't know if it is a common thing in other areas, but my town holds a clothing swap every month at the local elementary school. People bring in clothing, accessories, or miscellaneous items(books, blankets, electronics, Halloween costumes, etc) they don't want anymore. The donated clothes are sorted and laid out on tables(each table labeled by gender and age group). Anyone is welcome to pick out and keep any clothes/items for free even if they didn't donate anything. I think it's a wonderful way to help out the community. I have seen people there who didn't have much to give, but were in need. I have also seen a lot of mothers there who were excited to find clothes their children liked. If your community does a clothing swap, I recommend you donate your old clothes and stick around to see what you can find for yourself. Each month I enjoy donating and I know I'll find some great clothes to keep. It's a nice way to give to others as well as get something for yourself that you may normally not be able to afford."	t5_2tnuv	True

1337212531.0	tqso8	Please help! (Long post) I can't find good clothes anywhere and have very, very little in my closet.	Avi_	2	1	3	"I've shopped at a number of stores and can't seem to find anything. It seems anymore that you get to pick one of three attributes for clothing: well-made, fairly-priced or stylish. Trying to get clothes that fit two (or god forbid three) of these attributes is damn near impossible. I've gotten so frustrated every time I go to the mall and find nothing or order clothing online and have it come to my house only to have it all go back. I've threatened many times to move somewhere tropical and become a nudist.

I'm 21 and the majority of clothes that I have are from high school, and are really starting to look worn-out. What little I have bought in the last three years pills quickly, shrinks or warps horribly in the wash, or falls apart in a couple of wearings. I have very little left in my closet that is actually wearable.

I have a couple good pairs of jeans, a nice trench coat, a pair of ballet flats and some nice sneakers, two sundresses, two good cardigans and a couple lightweight scarfs I like. The rest is cheap and low-quality, and several years old. 

I would **love** some recommendations of places to shop, online or otherwise. Pretty much anywhere is fair game except for Forever 21, their stuff is really poorly made and I want pieces that will last me more than a season.

I'm 21, and the stuff in the juniors department seems too ""young"" and most other places just seem too ""mom-ish"". I like clothes that are laid-back and feminine, and not too trendy. My biggest issue is fit. I'm tall and lean, 5'7"", 120 pounds with very fair skin. Clothes are always too short in the sleeves, legs and torso for me. Dresses are the worst. Modcloth has cute stuff but it's all pretty short, and the dresses are the worst of it. Last I checked a dress was meant to cover your butt! I also run in to problems like clothing being too baggy or only available in unflattering neons. (Seriously wtf is with this trend recently?)

**TL;DR: I'm starting nearly from scratch with my wardrobe. I'm on a budget and needing clothes that are cute, fit a tall and slim frame and will actually last.**"	t5_2tnuv	True
