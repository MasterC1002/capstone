1362530937.0	19qs79	Hi. I just found this subreddit today. My dad and I both did a 40 day water only fast back in 2006!	Butthole_Scientist	35	2	20	"Its nice to read about other people here that did such long fasts. No one that I've told besides close family members believes me when I told them that I did a 40 day fast. I didn't think of it as a really big deal, to be honest. It was tough, but I felt great afterwards. My dad and I decided to go camp out in the AZ desert during winter of 2006, and only drink water. We both read a bunch of books and just relaxed for the whole time. It was a great experience, but it was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. It was nice, though, to not have any temptations, being out in the desert.

I got into a discussion today on another reddit and everyone was telling me how there was no way I could have done it, and how I would have died if it were true, because David Blaine apparently barely could do it even with medical supervision... I dunno. Getting called a liar really sucks, especially when I'm called a liar for something that was literally the hardest thing I've ever done :\

Anyways, are there any other people here that did a 40 day water fast?

Note: The documentary focuses specifically on caloric restriction, periodic fasting, alternate day fasting, and 5/2 fasting (5 feed days followed by 2 500-calorie ""fast"" days). Of course, Mosley is promoting his particular 5/2 fasting plan, but it's still a good summary of research related to a variety of IF styles.

It is the morning of day 31 and I just broke my fast on some sweet, wonderful, glorious juicy watermelon. I made sure to eat it slowly and in small increments. In two hours I'll eat a small handful of red grapes. Then two hours after I'll start with some fresh, organic celery and carrot juice (2 ounces each, watered down). I'll continue like this for today and the next two days. Then I'll make a homemade vegetable soup and eat that for three days, slowly introducing nuts and seeds. Then healthy fats, dairy, and eggs. Then grains and starches, and finally small amounts of meat. Since meats are the hardest to digest, I'll save that for day 10. I'm hoping to have nice late Valentine's dinner with my lovey who has supported me throughout my fast. 

My starting weight was 165 and today I am 140. I didn't lose a pound a day on average as I had expected, but I realize that this is probably because I didn't have a lot of water weight to lose in the beginning since I had been doing some extreme calorie cutting the weeks before the fast. So I am happy with my weight loss, because that means that most of the weight I lost was fat (I'm estimating that I lost 1 pound of muscle). 

I actually started trying to lose weight back in the beginning of December, through the 23/1 fasting. I weighed 180 back then. So since then I have lost a total of 40 pounds. I am a mere 10 pounds away from my goal weight. That being said, after I have successfully finished the re-feeding process, I plan to eat clean 6 days a week and have one cheat meal each week. I plan on sticking with the 23/1 schedule and eating a balanced but satisfying meal every night. I'm going to stay as far away from added sugar as I can. Inevitably, some sugar might sneak into some meals (say if I go out to a restaurant and they serve tomato sauce that has some sugar added to it). I'm going to limit my fruit intake to 1 piece of whole fruit a day. Yes, I know that fruit is healthy for me. But my main goal for now is fat loss, and it is pretty hard to do that when fruit is basically pure sugar. 

In addition to my meals, I'll also start my thyroid medication again, which will help with my metabolism (diagnosed hypothyroid, stopped medication for the fast). I'm also going to take a multivitamin and a fish oil capsule daily. Also, I'll be starting my hormonal birth control pills again which hopefully won't set me off track too much. 

I'm going to get my cholesterol and TSH tested on the 18th and I'll report back to you my findings. I am so excited to see my cholesterol level drop. Before the fast my total cholesterol was through the roof for someone my age (no family history or anything) and my triglycerides were pretty bad too. I've read online, though no doctor will admit it, that birth control pills can sometimes cause an elevation in cholesterol levels. So I am hoping that the combination of being off the pills and being on a fast will have dropped my levels to a good normal range. If you want to learn more about the effects of fasting on cholesterol levels (and other health benefits), read this article http://www.gaianstudies.org/articles4.htm.

This post is getting quite long so I'll end it here. I'll report back in three weeks. I still have more I want to mention about what I was expecting fasting to do for me and what it actually did -- some disappointments there :(

1358035620.0	16goz9	Report on my 7-day fast.	anon999000	26	2	8	"Hey, fasting --

I made this Reddit account (my first) to tell you about my fast, which lasted seven days, ending this evening. I was inspired by Steve Hendricks' Harpers article but encouraged by your stories and advice. I know I couldn't have done it without your help -- so thank you.




First my stats:

Male

32 years old

5'11""

Starting weight: 187

Ending weight: 170




**Day One**
Though I kept hydrated and drank a moderate amount of coffee, I was hit with a pretty bad headache and flu-like symptoms: irritability, lack of energy, lethargy, etc. Hungry, but not terribly so.

**Day Two**
The toughest day for me. Less of a headache but serious hunger. Lightheaded. Felt a slight bit of ""dislocation"" that I sometimes get when sick -- a sort of distance from my movements and actions. Nothing spacy or out-of-body -- not that severe -- just a kind of weird otherness. Greatly tempted when my mom brought over her slow-cooked Chinese short ribs but I stayed strong.

**Day Three**
Woke feeling great. No headache, no hunger, energetic, buoyant, filled with calm well-being. 

**Day Four**
Another hard day. What got me wasn't hunger, necessarily, but a strong nostalgia for food. I love food, love cooking, love eating, and missed it. Went for a long walk to distract myself. Grew exhausted and weak. Went to bed early.

**Day Five**
Like many others, this was my best day. Almost entirely free from hunger. Didn't find myself dwelling on food. Lots of energy. Felt upbeat and cheerful.

**Day Six**
Like day five, but a bit less so.

**Day Seven**
Same as day six. 



**General Observations**

- Dreams: I not only slept poorly (which I guess is common) but had a number of bad dreams. Not nightmares, exactly. Just depressing. Found this strange, as I've never had so many bad dreams over the course of one week. (Exception to this were my dreams on Day Four, leading to Dave Five, which were hilarious and happy.)

- ""Clarity of Mind"": A lot of posters note feeling ""clear-headed"" at points during their fast. I never experienced this. Maybe it comes after more days of fasting?

- Boredom: I never realized how much time is taken up by eating, preparing food, and cleaning up after meals. Left with these extra hours, I often felt bored, which almost always led to thought of food during the first four days. (When I fast next, I intend to plan for this.)

- Gas: This is a bit gross -- but even on Day Six I was still letting loose small farts. Some were wet, which was a bit embarrassing. No idea why this happened.




In summary, the four first days were difficult. Everything after that was easy. Given this was the first fast I've ever done, it was a fun adventure. I lost seventeen pounds, two notches off my belt, and had the most delicious salad I've ever tasted for dinner tonight. Definitely plan to do it again. 

Thanks again for all your advice."	t5_2s9dh	True

Stats: Female, 21 years old, 5'5'', SW:149lbs, longest prior fast was 4.5 days.

Day 0 - The day before my fast I actually ate very little, nothing but about a cup of frozen yogurt that I didn't want to go bad while I was fasting.

Day 1 - Worked all day at a desk job, then went shopping.  Skipped a party because I didn't trust myself so early on in a fast.  Hunger didn't really strike until the evening, a little bit of a headache, but nothing too bad.

Day 2 - Weighed in at 146 pounds.  Didn't do much except some walking and that made it hard to keep my mind off of food.  Headaches were worse but the more water I drank, the more they subsided.

Day 3 - Weighed in at 144.2 pounds.  Did a lot of heavy cleaning in my old apartment (scrubbed the bathroom, refrigerator, floors) and also walked a mile back to my new apartment carrying a really heavy bag.  No headaches so far although I did have a powerade 0 so I have some electrolytes.  Had a strange dream last night where I was in high school and my legs were so weak that I walked like a QWOP person, I think it was due to my sore legs.  My goal for the rest of the day is to drink a lot of water because when I'm not thinking about it I often skip hours without it.

Day 4 - Mondays suck even when you are eating, so I'm gonna start with the pros.  NSVs - I had to wear a belt with my pants that were once too small for me and my skin looks great.  Weight this morning was 142.4 pounds, cool!  I think something that people forget to mention on these updates is that even though there are highs and lows, for the most part a fast is a challenge.  It's hard waking up knowing that you will at times feel tired and weak throughout the day, so it helps to keep the end in sight.  I'm halfway there!  I drank a black grande iced coffee from starbucks this morning and it really perked me up, maybe even too much, so I'm gonna hold off on coffee for the remainder of the fast.  I forgot to bring a water bottle to work today so I've been making hourly trips to the water fountain.  Hunger is currently non-existent.  I have a breathing condition that I've had since high school in which I have trouble breathing out and make an occasional wheezing sound.  It has gotten a bit more prominent since the fast began but it usually acts up during exciting and stressful situations.  I'll be back tomorrow for another update! 

Quick nighttime edit - Its a little past midnight and the acid reflux/heartbearn is pretty brutal.  I've been sipping water, I'm gonna wait until the morning and see how I feel.  I want to finish this fast but this is seriously uncomfortable.  Any insight on this would be wonderful!  Is this standard, should I wait it out? Thanks!

Day 5 Morning update! - Last night was really rough so I made the somewhwat hasty decision to drink half a can of swanson fat free low sodium chicken broth.  This is about 12 calories of broth so i realize my fast was compromised at this point but I figured that it was better than giving up.  The pain was so bad that I decided that if conditions didn't impove in the morning, the broth would be the beginning of breaking my fast and that I would have some coconut water for breakfast.  Luckily, the only discomfort I have this morning is a bit of a toothache (weird) and the usual weakness and fatigue.  My leg muscles were killing me last night and I feared low potassium may have been the reason but they feel better today so unless they act up severely I'm gonna write it off as fatigue.  This morning I weighed 140.2!  Sorry for the dramatics last night, I'm proud of myself for pulling through despite the broth cheat.

END - Well, last night around 7pm (the time after I finished my last meal 7 days ago) I had some of the sweetest coconut water ever.  This morning I am drinking orange-carrot juice, and tonight I may try some brothy soup.  Thanks for following my journey, it wasn't as bad as I thought!

I'm 6' .5""    For you metric users- well, you're probably used to converting.  I think it's 5 kilo's, a stone, and a ghoughpteighbteau.

In the beginning of March, I changed up my diet a bit. Not having read anything about IF, I just started to try to wait to eat until I was truly hungry.  As the days went on, it was getting to be 2 or 3 in the afternoon.   

For the previous duration of my progress, I had averaged very consistently,  .7 lbs lose per week.

For the first 15 days of March, I averaged  1 lb per week.

Then I started reading about IF.   Decided to wait until at least 5pm before I eat.  This started on March 15   Most days, it was around 6, when I got home from work.  I'd have my usual dinner, big spinach salad, with either some chicken, pork, or avocado on top.   For the first 4-5 days, I would still be hungry, and an hour later have either some fried eggs, or a plate of cheese/pepperoni as a snack. The snacks got smaller as time went on.

After about 5 days and things leveled out- here's how I felt:
The overbearing hunger- gone.   Occasional stomach growl, but not big deal.     My energy through the day was rock solid.     When I did get to eating time, it just wasn't a big deal, I wasn't dying to get fed, It was just time, and when I started to eat, I'd have a calm sense of ""yup, I am hungry"" And be full pretty quick (guess my stomach shrunk a bit)

This past weekend was a really big test.   I was VERY active both days, working outside in the yard.   I had the same great energy all day. Never light headed, just kept on rocking.

March 15,  206.8    lbs
April 15, 196.4    lbs 
2.3  lbs per week
I'm very consistent with when I weigh, same stuff in my pockets, same level of hydration etc...


TL:DR
Once in the groove, I felt better than ever.  Went from .7lbs per week average to a 2lb per week average.    "	t5_2s9dh	True

I have been in treatment for a while, but nothing has seemed to work. My depression has completely decimated my will to live, and has made me an isolated degenerate. I am starting a water fast today in hopes of regaining my will to live through suffering. 

I sit around all day just thinking how horrible life is and how much I want it to end. I feel like the agony of starvation will make me value life again. If starvation cannot make stoke my natural instincts to live, nothing will. I will either come out of this like a phoenix, or I wont. This is my last hope.

Fasting to Live
---------------------------

Day 1 (2/28/2013): [I'll have to suspend this fast. Friends came over with weed and pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/qpk3uFV.gif)"	t5_2s9dh	True
1323157568.0	n2abe	About to enter day 4 of my first Water Fast! Going strong!	FitnessMinded	25	3	11	"So after doing a bunch of research online about the benefits of fasting, I finally decided to embark on a water fast.  The time was right:  I don't work for about a week, I am out of groceries and broke, so the time was right financially, and I am in a good place mentally and spiritually to do this. 

So far I have experienced very minor hunger that usually subsides when I drink water.  I expected to experience the keto flu, or the sickness that comes on during day 2-3 but so far I have felt fine.  I was lethargic and tired on day 2, but today on day 3 I woke up with no problem and had lots of energy, which really surprised me!  Normally I snooze my alarm a few time and it takes a lot of will power to jump out of bed, but today I hopped right up as soon as my alarm went off.

I have many reasons for my fast:  I have had an alcohol problem for a long time, and I read that extended fasting resets the body and can help rid you of addiction.  I also am doing it as a detox to let my body cleanse itself, and I am doing it to try to rid myself of some harmless fatty cysts that I have called [lipomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoma).  They are just harmless fatty cysts, that form for no apparent reason.  I believe they are a manifestation of stress built up in my body...stored toxins and other crap that my body just couldn't get rid of during years of excessive drinking and eating garbage.  I've been really healthy the past year or two however, and eat fairly clean, but the lipomas have no gone away.

It is my hopes with this fast, that if I stay in ketosis long enough, my body will get to an extreme, deep healing phase and consume the cysts as a form of energy. I have read other people's experiences and have reason to believe this will work.

ALso, there was a period of about 7 months when I was running 6 miles a day, and eating extremely clean, and not drinking and the majority of the lipomas started shrinking on their own...only to come back when I fell off the wagon and started drinking a lot and slowed my exercise.

So short post turned into a long one,  I am excited about this fast and my experience so far, and would love to hear anyone else's experiened on an open ended extended fast!"	t5_2s9dh	True

1348976644.0	10p465	So happy I found IF	TarenMaim	20	0	7	"Hi everyone, 

I just came here to tell you my story and how relieved and excited I am to have found IF, here goes:

4 years ago I started my struggle to lose the baby weight I had put on while carrying my son, and I tried to do it in the ""healthiest"" way I could, eating 5-6 clean meals a day like all the books/magazines/websites said. But do you know what happened? I either maintained or gained weight and I felt deprived the ENTIRE 4 years. 

Then a few days ago my sister introduced me to IF and I'm so relieved I'm nearly in tears, I feel like I've had an epiphany, a ""this is it"" moment of total clarity.

For years I never watched my weight and ate whatever I wanted while remaining slender, then when I tried to diet I ballooned and would binge and was constantly thinking about food...why is this? I believe it's because when I was eating whatever I wanted I was just listening to my body and eating when I felt hungry, I was on a natural IF diet where I wouldn't eat until 1-2 pm every day and go long stretches without food. And when I started forcing more meals into myself I never felt satisfied with those tiny meals and I often over ate and triggered binges. 

I know it's only been a few days, but they have been amazing, I feel like  huge food demon was plucked from my shoulder...today I didn't even think about binging, I didn't count the minutes until the next time I could eat a few carrot sticks and I didn't count calories other than to give myself a rough estimate of where I wanted to be at the end of my food window (and I easily stayed under that goal without even trying)

Bah, I'm rambling but man I just feel great! If anyone else out there is thinking about trying this DO IT. Even if it's just for a day or two, you never know you might be like me and end up thrilled"	t5_2s9dh	True

1297307292.0	fihek	Introduction to Intermittent Fasting (IF)	areich	21	2	13	"As wikipedia [states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting), ""Intermittent fasting (IF) is a pattern of eating that alternates between periods of fasting (usually meaning consumption of water only) and non-fasting."" There are many variations. Heres a few from [leangains](http://www.leangains.com/2008/06/brief-primer-on-popular-approaches-to.html) (hours fasting, hours ""eating"", nickname, abbreviation):

* 20/4 - Warrior's Diet (WD)
* 36/12 - Alternate Day Fasting (ADF)
* 16/8 - [Sure Fire Fat Loss](http://www.leangains.com/2008/06/sure-fire-fat-loss.html) (leangains)
* 19/5 - [Fast-5 Diet](http://www.fast-5.com/)
* 24/256, 24/232 -  Eat Stop Eat
* 7-10 days, 4 times a year - [Paul Bragg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bragg) (taught Jack LaLanne)

The basic premise is always the same: reset the body's ""need"" for food at specific times and retrain your appetite. Just like Newton's [laws of motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion), the universe will come up with reasons to break your fast and, therefore, your rhythm. ~~~Especially around the holidays where seemingly every desk has an extra bowl of candy.~~~ Here are a few things that may be useful during your own fasting:

Tips for before the fast:

* Plan on eating whatever you have on hand and check the expiration dates now.

* Depending on your goal of health, fitness, and/or weight loss, you may not wish to do an easy transition. Instead, feast up! This is your last meal before you get back to eating so you might as well try to pack it in.

* Tell anyone you wish to know you are fasting, beforehand, it's ""tacky"" to tell people one is fasting during one. ;)

Tips during the fast:

* It's important to remain positive and surround yourself with inspiring things &amp; media that which is mood and energy enhancing. 

* Stay busy! Invent a reason to do something where you won't feel distracted or tempted.

* Drink lots of **cold water**, the *colder* the better. Besides cold water is great work for your body to warm down, it will give you a full feeling.

* Fast with someone else - this can keep you from breaking early just considering that you have someone else fasting.

* **Always carry water, a canteen, a bottle, or a full glass within sight. ** 

* Water Water Water Water

Tips on after the fast / breakfast:

* Depending on if you are doing a true water fast or a modified version, you may wish to juice up with fruit and/or vegetable juice.

* Bragg suggests a salad as your first breakfast, whatever time that may be. Dressing is lemon juice. Spring salad, not iceberg!

* Don't overeat, whatever you do! Your metabolism has increased and you will feel very uncomfortable if you overeat.

* Take it easy! No one is likely to snatch your food away. Don't forget to drink plenty of water during and after the transition.

I've lost a lot of weight over the years and credit fasting, exercise and diet (in that order). You can do it! Some hopefully helpful tips:

* A 3 day fast is useful, but as tspix said, it's more of a ""look-see"" and you are likely to be demotivated when you gain all you lost and then some as soon as you stop the fast.

* Weigh yourself at the same time every day to get an accurate reading. A good day is a half pound lost, a great day is a full pound and a normal day may be no weight gained or lost (this could be muscle gain, extra water weight, etc.). The point is to not get overexcited or discouraged. *Remember, it took a long time to gain that weight and it's going to take time to lose it.*

* Don't get too caught up w/water only fasts. Instead, **concentrate on calories consumed**. Fasting is very personal, so if you chose to consume fresh juices instead of meals, that's still a fast, albeit a juice fast. There are no rewards of great fasting and it's not going to be comfortable all the time.

* Have a colon plan. If you are over 30, you need to plan on consuming fiber. You will feel a lot better if you take a little psyllium during your fast which has negligible calories, will make you feel full, and help your body to heal itself.

* Come up w/a plan on when you want those 20 pounds off, mark it on your calendar and constantly ask the question, ""What am I doing to achieve that goal?"" If you are about to eat some Halloween candy that will set you back, that's a decision to make (it's ok either way). It's up to you on how hard you want to make this.

* Carry a water bottle everywhere, even if you aren't fasting. Feeling full is about being properly hydrated. You'll succeed this way.

* Get plenty of rest.

* Laugh, have fun and make sure you are stopping to smell the roses. A fast isn't a sentence you have given yourself for doing something bad. It's a ticket out of prison but requires work to achieve.

* Go ahead and post to complete step 1 (deciding on a goal and sharing w/us). Good Luck!

1375463788.0	1jkpg2	Testing my willpower -A keto girls 23/1 IF to strictly a water fast journey.	_pishposh_	20	1	33	"I'm posting this because I'm thinking about food and trying to keep myself occupied in a somewhat productive manner.  Im 27, 5'6"" and have been overweight since childhood. No background story here about much of the past, we'll get to the point. Around the middle of May 2013, I started a ketogenic diet, weighing in at 196lbs and started losing about one pound a week.

On Monday, the 29th of this month, I started a 23/1 IF and cut out dairy and sugar substitutes to help break my stall. (I love me dat dairy!) I was 179.8lbs. I'd drink 12oz bullet coffee (coffee with coconut oil/grass fed butter) in the morning and sip on it throughout the day whenever I felt hungry, which wasn't that often. I drank a lot of cold water (100+oz/day) as well, to prevent headaches and other yucky feelings. 
Exercise:I did a 3.5 mile walk and then ate a small dinner within my 6-7pm hour until I felt full.

Tuesday: 177.4lbs. I used to weigh this about 2 years ago when I cut out fast food/milkshakes, exercised 2-4 times a week and, started watching my caloric intake. Of course, with my lack of willpower, I fell back into my comfort zone and started 'treating' myself whenever I wanted. But enough about that. Exercise on Tuesday consisted of a 7min HIIT, silly dancing/running in place and bench presses. 

Enter Wednesday, day 3 of the 23/1 IF. Shark week has now begun. Felt bloated and crampy, didn't exercise one bit. Felt irritable, was grumpy all day. Ate dinner around 6 and stayed up too late. Weighed in at 175.6. 


Yesterday (Thurs):
The scale read 174.8 and I fit into a pair of size 12 designer jeans that I haven't worn in the last two years. Surely, this aided in being in a good mood. I took my bullet coffee along to work with me and didn't feel hungry at all so, I chose to start a water fast since I hadn't eaten anything anyway since 6-7pm Weds night anyway. 
Exercise: I ran further than I have in years and completed a 2.5 mile run/walk.

My entire life, I've never been able to say no to myself so, when I opened the fridge around 6pm -purely out of the 'making dinner now -nom!' routine- and grabbed a head of cauliflower, I turned around, put it back and told myself I could do this. No food _pishposh_, not today. I had a slight headache around 10pm but that was also probably because I was staring at the computer for too long. Drank more water, went to bed. 


Water fasting Day 2:
Woke up at 6am this morning without the alarm (which never happens), feeling more alert and very optimistic. Weighed in at 173.6lbs (6.2lbs down since the start of 23/1 IF). Grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and began my day. I still have a very slight headache sometimes during the day and am experiencing light hunger pains here and there but it's nothing that isn't manageable and nothing that water hasn't cured. 

My mind has stopped racing and is clearer than it has been in months (former ent here). The only thing I'm really contemplating is how long I want to fast for. I have no fears of getting ill from water fasting, I've done enough research to know that I'll be fine. I sometimes just give into myself too easily and I love to eat my broccoli (Ty, r/keto!). I'm going to finish today and also tomorrow and see how I feel Sunday morning. If my body agrees, I'll try for 7 days. Then, maybe 10. Maybe I'll keep going to 30, who knows. It's a pure willpower test for me and I'm pretty sure if it comes down to eating food or my physical appearance and inner happiness, food will always lose. I have the extra fat to burn (at least 30-40lbs) and the courage to push myself, so I think I'll be at least seeing that 7th day. 

Rambles:
I still don't like looking at myself naked in the mirror. I'm 27, guys. Summer is almost over and I've never been in a bikini in public. I've missed out on so much in life only because I could never push myself hard enough to find that motivation that I needed. I guess it's been kind of an ongoing spiritual journey as well :)
Shark week update: No cramps anymore and I'm no longer feeling moody! Hurray for everyone around me!

The crazy thing is that I am not hungry at all during my fast, it's just when I come home and see these high calorie dense foods, I have a harder time resisting than if I were to split my meals throughout the day.

This makes sense why I do binge after a fast, (damn biology) or maybe I am just weak mentally. Anyways, I am trying to figure out ways to keep on fasting minus the binges.

I am 27 days into my 40 days water-only fast. So far it has been wonderful: i've achieved that sense of clear headedness, enhanced energy and revitalization i've been after. Like everyone says, the first three days are very difficult (I was very hungry!) however, afterwards it was pretty smooth sailing. I have also successfully lost 11kg, with minimal apparent strength and muscle loss. 


But, /r/fasting, I have some issues I wanted to ask the community about. Lately I have been on edge for long periods of time it seems like. Just this morning I snapped at my GF for leaving out her yoga pads in the living room - i usually never care about this stuff. Three days ago, I also had a brief dizzy spell after climbing the two flights of stairs to my flat and bumped my head against my door. It left a pretty nasty bruise on about a third of my face (left forehead to temple). This may be unrelated, but four of my top front teeth have begun to be noticeable loose (and wiggly).

I have been having trouble breaking into the 230's and have found myself eating more, still keto, but more.  Decided to do a 5 day water fast to try to reset my body and mind back to my good old strict ways.  My results so far;

Monday(Day 1) - Was rough, fairly hungry at night and still had headaches despite the fact of drinking a quart of water every hour and peeing twice an hour.  Slept well.  Good BM.

Tuesday(Day 2) - Less hunger in general.  Same water drinking, no headaches.  Almost cracked because I had to make my kiddo dinner, but refrained.  Zero hunger at night.  Was a bit cranky. No BM :(

Wednesday(Day 3) - Woke up feeling really good and weirdly light.  Made breakfast for kid and no problem.  Stomach is growling like crazy but no hunger and feel fantastic so far this morning.  At my desk now with no meetings so it is going to be a GREAT day. No BM yet:(

I don't post much and this really isn't a helpful post, but felt like sharing my experience so far.  I am planning on either extending the fast to 10 days (but know the weekend will be much harder) or eat a little Saturday and Sunday and then do another 5 days next week.

*Edit* Update

Thursday((Day 4) - Woke up early and alert.  No hunger and feel good.  Occasional urges to get food but not due to hunger, boredom more I guess.  No headaches, empty belly felling but I like that. :)  Checked scale and I have leveled back to my lightest this year so that is good.

This year, this Sunday happens to fall on April Fool’s Day. However, this is the best opportunity I’ve had to address the /r/fasting community since we passed a significant threshold w/1000 readers (which I celebrated with a quick [message on twitter](http://twitter.com/alexreich/statuses/185828977624104960).

If I had to choose a single reason why I think this community continues to grow, it’s because many of us are choosing to tune out. Not just food, but what most media tells us what, how and when to consume. Many of us know that the world was a very different place just a short time ago and we can tune into that simplicity in personal consumption any time we want.

About a month ago, one of our readers, [sacca7](http://www.reddit.com/user/sacca7), messaged me as a volunteer to mod and it got me thinking about the future direction of this subreddit. I’d like to broaden our focus to not just include food but “abstaining and/refraining from” anything, in other words, fasting in general. For example, you could skip reading reddit for X time, that would a fast. Right now, our X time might be measured in milliseconds, but you catch my drift.

We've come a long way in a short time since I was the only reader. We have inspired each other to know how to successfully start and complete a fast and what to do in between. **Fasting as a growing lifestyle is undeniable.**

So chime in! What do think? Who else would like to mod? Hey, if I’m going to successfully “dog-food” this and try it myself (i.e. a reddit fast), I’m going to need some else to help drive (and hopefully someone who also is a poster). Here’s to our next reader!

1368630855.0	1edwuq	After half a year of consistent IF. I've finally adapted.	itmcb	16	1	11	"I've been doing IF on and off for 2 years. I've only recently decided to go fully into it. 

A typical day now looks like. Wake up at 5am. Break my fast around noon with some bullet proof coffee. Have a green shake (water, spinich, kale and berries) around 2pm then have my big meal around 7pm.

Depending on if it's a work out day or not, I'll have a meal around 2pm with my green shake. 

Hunger is no longer an issue in the morning. The green shakes help tremendously with hunger in the afternoon. 

Benefits

* No lunch time crashes
* Food is more enjoyable. By eating only once a day, I can enjoy the food more opposed to grazing all day.
* Tasty dinners without much restriction.

I remember when I first tried IF. Dear god. I thought I was going to faint at 10am after skipping breakfast. 

It takes time to adapt but it's worth it!

1341287616.0	vymsw	A few tips	tridorr	17	3	8	"For anyone looking to get into fasting, here are a few tips I've picked up on that may help you guys.

I do a 16 hour fast each day followed by an 8 hour eating window.  One thing I've picked up on is to not stress getting food in your stomach right before you begin your fast.  If you're not hungry, don't eat just because you wont be able to eat for x days.  You're not going to waste away and die.  Once you learn that, everything will follow.

Also, don't pig out when you come off of a fast.  Just eat a normal meal, and wait 15 minutes.  If you're still hungry, eat a little bit more, but I guarantee you won't be hungry.  

Keep busy.  I know it's a really common tip, but it's helpful.  Now, what I've noticed is there are two kinds of busy.  There's a ""busy"" that you're actively trying to find something else to focus on instead of food; and there's a real busy.  You want to find the real busy.  You want to be busy that you forget to eat.  

Break the habits that cause you to eat.  I used to go right to my cabinet where I keep all my food and just look in every time I came up from my basement.  I used to get food, but once I realized I wasn't actually hungry, and it was a habit to open the cabinet, I made a point of not getting anything (even though I did open it).  Now I make it a point of not opening the cabinet.  

Drink a lot of water.  It helps.  That's all for this one.

Learn the difference between being bored and being hungry.  I never understood the difference before I started fasting.  I *knew* sometimes I wasn't really hungry, but I felt hungry so I ate.  Now I know when I'm hungry and when I'm just bored.  Once you learn the difference (and I think this comes with time) you'll be better off.

If possible (given your schedule) eat a serving of vegetables and drink water about 15 minutes before you eat your meal.  This way your brain has had time to send the messages that you've eaten all over your body.  I don't know if this is commonly recommended, but it prevents me from over eating.

Don't keep foods you know you can't turn down.  As you get better self control, bring them back in the house.  You don't want to deny yourself of everything you like, you just want to follow your diet.

If you cheat, don't think of it as a failure.  Think of it as a learning experience.  Learn what led up to you not reaching your goal.  Start again, and try to stop that from happening.

But that's fine since I understand that it is just water. I still have some fat to lose, so I've been alternating days of short HIIT cardio with low rep, heavy weight training to build back muscle and increase metabolism. On the cardio days I try to stick to as few calories as possible (around 600 to 800) with a low carb count, and on the weight training days I'm allowed to eat carbs, so naturally my calories will be higher so I usually average around 800 to 1000 calories -- this is while doing 23/1 IF, so that I can have a big meal and feel satisfied at the end of the day. Note: yes, I realize that my calories are really low, but I'm trying to account for my metabolism being slow until I can get my TSH levels back to normal (see below). 

I got my blood drawn on day 7 of breaking my fast. I dropped my triglycerides by 20 points, LDL cholesterol by 30 points, and good cholesterol dropped quite a bit which is bad but it will get back up there once I start eating more fats. I was admittedly restricting fat intake the days before the blood test to try to get as much decrease in total cholesterol as possible.

Results of the CMP were all within normal range except for mildly elevated liver enzymes, which is to be expected since my liver was taxed by having to process so much fat and toxin breakdown in such a short amount of time. 

Obviously my TSH was high because I had stopped my thyroid medicines. Maybe in my mind a tiny part of me wished that I could magically cure my hypothyroidism with the water fast, because having to take synthetic hormones for the rest of my life doesn't sound appealing. Oh well.

For myself; 

* How?  
I've started at the beginning of the year with a 36 hour fast on Saturdays. This past week I've added in a 24 hour fast on Tuesdays, and I'm considering extending my Saturday fast to 48 hours. I do drink coffee with coconut creamer in the mornings, and some iced tea during the days and hot tea in the evenings.
 
* Why?  
I'm fairly overweight, so my main goal is to lose weight. Also, the overall health benefits are attractive.
 
* How's that working out for me?  
It's working very well, actually. In addition to my version of ""intermittent fasting"" I've started a martial class during the weekday mornings. I've managed to get things to where my body is used to going to these classes daily, and I don't feel that my fasting gets in the way of my daily life at all. Also my primary weight loss goal is far ahead of schedule.

Some other interesting notes... Sometimes my schedule doesn't work out. Somehow that's mentally fine in my mind, I know I'm continually plodding forward so a small step back occasionally doesn't worry me at all, especially when I know I can simply move my fast do to tomorrow.

-18 year old male

-BMI of 27.3

-185 lbs (all fat, very little muscle is left.)

-5'9 (69 inches)

Over the last year and a half I've spiraled into a person I thought I would never become, when I look in the mirror now I feel nothing but disgust. My previous motivation to stay in shape was replaced by a depression that caused me to eat everything in sight, no matter how unhealthy it was. I lost all of my muscle definition and replaced it with fat. A home relocation during the most important year of my life(so far) sent me down this path and I haven't been able to muster up the willpower to get off it. That changed this Saturday.


So today marks the 6th day of my ~30 day water fast to restart life on the healthier side. My plan while undertaking the fast is to get as much bed rest as possible while still being able to fulfill my daily responsibilities. I have thrown in a bit of very light cardio but doubt I will be able to keep up with it as I get further into my fast.


I needed a place to document this to keep myself in check and figured no better place than this subreddit. Perhaps some others may even get motivation from it.

I've done a few strings of WD days in the past, and practice the Daniel Fast more than any other. Just like running a increasingly longer distance over a period of time builds endurance, I've found that I can go longer periods w/out eating w/out really trying.

Pros:

* Simplifies the whole fasting concept, no planning around schedules or specific times
* For weight maintenance, easier to consume fewer calories
* Feel benefits of fasting on daily basis (i.e. increased immune system)
* Allows regular exercise schedule

Cons:

* Social stigma of daily lunch w/out lunch w/co-workers
* Increases possibility of over-eating
* Not advised while recovering from an injury

Verdict: For routine, I still prefer the 3 day I.F. or leangans approach where one spreads out calories over time, but I do like WD for race prep and I will formerly incorporate it on my calendar for the next one.

1367128415.0	1d9d1m	No more excessive sweating, no more acne!	majesticmajesty	16	3	23	"3 years ago, I was looking up detox cleanses and came to the conclusion that none of them would compare to a strict, water-only fast. Afterall, fasting has at least a few scientific articles written on it, but no 'detox clease' has gotten any postive scientific aknowledgement. I'm sure there's some merit to detoxing, but I just don't understand what organic maple syrup, cayenne pepper, and lemon juice, or any other 'magical formula,' have what a body needs during a fast, and neither does science.

I was very skeptical of whether or not fasting would do anything for me, but I figured 'what do I have to lose besides a few pounds?'

I was 20 years old and knew years of unrelenting acne and excessive perspiration was a sign something wasn't going well. Since about 16, I had been working out and eating healthier than just about anyone I knew, but that 'only' brought about a a more muscular/toned body. Maybe this would have all gone away eventually, but how many more years would I have to suffer? Honestly, I really didn't expect fasting to do anything note worthy to my body, but it did.

December of my sophomore year of college, I did a 36-hour water only fast. It was preceded and succeeded by a few days of easing into it where alcohol, meats, dairy, cereals, nuts, fruit and vegetables were eliminated/introduced into my diet (in that order). During the first day of eating nothing, I had to swish water in my mouth to eliminate the awful taste before drinking any, and my armpits were wetter than normal (which is really saying something).

I woke the morning of the second, water-only, day and began eating some fruit in the early afternoon. I had worn no anti-perspirant for the last couple of days, but I went to bed that night with dry armpits :) Over the course of the next few weeks, I stopped using my perscription-strength acne creams because I had no pimples :D A month later, and I had very clear skin and never had pit-stains, all without applying any creams or anti-perspirants! 

I now do a water fast for 36 - 48 hours once or twice a year, because I will start becoming sweatier and my acne will come back. I understand some acne and some sweating is ok, maybe even good, but not the way it used to be or can become if I wait too long to do a fast. As a biochemist, I try to look at this scientifically, but I struggle to find an answer why exactly this happens. Some friends think I am crazy, others think I am a genius and rush off to try something similar. No one has gotten results like I have, but then again, none of my friends have done exactly what I do. They always do some sort of juice fast, raw vegetable diet, or some 'detox cleanse' they bought off the internet, despite me giving them a thorough run-down of what I do. I've done about 7 or 8 of these fasts, and am doing one currently. I'd really like to know if anyone else has experienced this, I am very curious and excited since I just found this subreddit!

**TL;DR** Fasting dramatically helped with my self confidence, and has made me feel much better physically. Does anyone else have a story similar to mine?

1365969555.0	1cccd9	Day 5 of what I hope to be my first 21-day water-only fast; seeking answers to a few queries as well as general insight, tips, and recommended learning material. Any feedback welcome.	warkenm	14	1	23	"I’m presently on day five of what I hope to be my first 21-day fast. I’m not new to fasting, but I’ve not yet gone past a week, simply because I’ve never felt the urge to. I have mastered the five-day-fast (as far as mindset/discipline/expectations/ease of adaptation goes; of course the coming-down off of food has the same effects for me as for many). Now I’m awfully curious as to how challenging it will be to attempt 3 weeks. Not only do I wish to challenge my mind, I endeavour to reset my taste buds, restart a desired lifestyle (ketogenic or paleo diet), save money, stabilize my mood, seek greater mental clarity, focus on work, reading, writing, organizing the plans and events of coming months, and generally feel a renewed sense of energy and lightness which one achieves through fasting. Of course, I also wish to shed a few pounds. I suppose I’m looking for some pro tips as well as insight into a few queries.

Firstly, I recall a year or so ago I fasted for 7 or 8 days but did not slow in my exercise regimen; in fact, I may have increased the rigour. Late in the night of the 7th, I began to feel unwell/nauseous and eventually vomited mere stomach acid. It was a rather unpleasant experience and frightened me into immediate re-feeding, thinking something was terribly wrong. I (think I) recognize now that I’d overextended myself that night swimming lengths, and probably my muscles produced lactic acid which, coupled with the acid already present from lack of digestion, served to throw off the pH of my stomach, the solution being to rid my stomach of acid = my body decided to vomit. I’m wondering, how do I prevent this unpleasantness in the future, and what exactly was going on at the time? I don’t want to be afraid to pursue activity/exercise, so I’d like to plan in advance what I might do if I begin to feel that acidic-nausea again, since I want to try to fast beyond a week this time. Any insight/tips?

Secondly, I’m not going to keel over and die at some point during this fast, am I? My body would tell me when to stop if it needed me to, right? It would indicate struggle in some way, wouldn’t it? What are some signs I ought to stop? What are some signs I must address something but with a simple fix that would allow me to continue the fast (e.g. the symptoms of a simple depletion of some nutrient or other that, by supplementing, I could dispel and move on from)? In essence, I’d like to know which symptoms would tell me to stop a fast and which would simply tell me to address some need and continue?

Thirdly, in general, really, any insights, tips, or resources?

Lastly, I noticed this article *has* been posted in the past, but perhaps there are some new folks in the subreddit who’d appreciate the link, so I thought I’d link it again in case anyone has not read it and wishes to. It’s well-written and abated my initial hesitation to try an extended fast.

Thanks for reading. Everyone, get up and drink more water...NOW! Happy fasting, all. 


Edit: Broke my fast on Day 12, unfortunately, and not for lack of motivation. I was feeling great and very confident that I'd make it. Then, my older brother and his girlfriend showed up at my doorstep unexpected, a 7-hour drive. ""Surprise! We're only here for a few hours, picking up a dirtbike we're buying from someone on the internet. Let's go to dinner!""  Now, if it were anyone else, I'd either admit my situation or make some sort of excuse, but my brother wouldn't understand, and so I thought, what's the harm? I'll break the fast and then resume in the morning, start fresh again. But I didn't start fresh again. It's been over a week, and it's been a bad week. I wasn't prepared yet for the lifestyle change I planned to make, and so it's been junk-food all week, high-carb...let's just say I had been really pleased with my progress and now I hate myself for ruining it and actually making things worse.

Plan is to start again tomorrow morning; and I endeavour (again) for this fast to be 21-days long, if not longer (to help repair the damage I've done, weight-wise). Wish me luck, and I will update here every-so-often.

Edit2: In case anyone is interested, I'm on day 17 this second-time around. Plan to make it to 21 days and then briefly break my fast with some eggs and fruit and then continue on for another five days. Based on how I presently feel, I think it's very do-able, and I look forward to achieving the goal I set for myself. "	t5_2s9dh	True

Starting weight: 178.8 lbs

Morning weight: 172

Evening weight: 171

Daily Activity:

* 9am - Woke up, drank coffee. There were some of you that were concerned about my coffee use during this fast. I'm not noticing any increase in my heart rate or any jitteriness. I am a regular coffee drinker and caffine consumer, so perhaps the effects aren't as pronounced?
* 12pm - Lunch with my husband. No hunger.
* 2pm - Soccer with preschoolers. I noticed that I was slightly more energetic.
* 4pm - Grocery shopping. This was a little tough since Central Market has delicious food everywhere.
* 6pm - Had friends over for beer and food. The food was quite tempting and it was hard, but I managed to get through the evening. I even baked shortbread cookies with a chocolate drizzle and didn't taste any of it! I stuck to water and soda for the duration of the party. I did have to lie when a friend asked why I wasn't eating. I replied that I had eaten earlier and was too full.

Overview: I definitely agree with the comments addressing workout recovery from yesterday's post. My thighs and calves are quite sore. I remain steadfast in my decision to omit intense exercise the rest of this fast. I drank more water today. My hunger was still quite manageable, the few times it surfaced. I enjoyed the increase in energy.

Forecast: Tomorrow I will be working with high school students in the morning, followed by an afternoon of jewelry crafting and an evening of cards and beer (due the the large amount of leftover beer that accumulated from tonight).

1) So, I want to lose weight (20 lbs) fast by fasting, and then maintain that weight with diet and exercise. Reason for this is that it seems better to get actual fit when you're slim than when you're chubby and have less energy.

Is this a bad idea and why? 

2) Is it true that a longer fast can heal stretchmarks so much they become almost invisible? Has anyone had any experience with this? 

3) How important is it to eat very light and raw in the first 3-7 days pre-fast? I feel like starting my all water fast right now, but I had processed food yesterday, so is it better to eat vegetables only for the next few days and then start the fast?

4) How long does it take to drop 20 lbs on a water fast? 

5) Anything else there is to know about a first fast? :)

1325852255.0	o5cih	Day 5 of an x-day water fast... feeling strangely unhungry and energetic	meramera	16	2	9	"I recently started a water fast... I guess that I thought I would stay on it for a day or two.  I am now on Day 5 and can honestly say that I have not felt hungry for more than a few minutes.  I also have an abundance of energy -- quiet energy, but it is definitely there.  I have been backpacking every day and enjoying the little moments.

On a previous Master Cleanse (7 days) I recall feeling nearly frantic with constant hunger and I ended it because it did not feel at all peaceful or particularly healthy.  Since starting the water fast, I have been reflecting on food -- its social context and such, but not wanting any.  It feels particularly luxurious to be living in a society where, should I choose to eat, I am never more than 30 seconds from being able to do so. Thus for me, fasting is a particular form of control that I have not previously experienced.

I am not fasting for weight loss, though I have weight to lose.  I am not even particularly sure why I am doing this.  But it feels special somehow -- and incredibly natural and easy.  I guess I wasn't expecting that.

I've no idea how long I will continue this. I can only say for sure that today I will be fasting.  Each subsequent day, as long as this feeling lasts, will bring a new decision.  I guess that's how it is with all things if you think about it.

I don't want to say too much more about the insights I'm having because I suspect I'm already tampering with the floodgates.  But I do wonder if anyone else is currently fasting and finding themselves with unexpected but not unpleasant insights into food culture or other topics."	t5_2s9dh	True

I have completed 4-5 day water fasts in the past with good results. I felt clear-headed, less anxious/depressed, and my skin improved.

But now it's the weekend, or rather my weekend, and it's 9:30AM and I'm starving. I'm seriously looking at cats on imgur and wondering how much meat is on one. I caved and cooked up some beef and green beans, but now that I've broken my new routine I'm wondering;

Does it still ""work"" 5 days out of 7? 

I have a labor intensive job, but averaging out my week I'd say my activity probably comes to about 2-3 hours of light cardio. On weekends I don't do much other than taking a 1-2 mile walk. on the PAL scale, I'd put myself at ""Moderately Active"" on weekdays, and Sedentary on weekends.

I am posting here because I could use your support and backup. I've never been this committed and it feels good. Good enough to want to share. I had this idea, and I've seen other people do it, where you make a blog, or some similar site and share as much as you can about what you are doing, so, after a while, you have some people who ""follow"" you and in turn, it is much harder to fall off the wagon, when you know someone is rooting for you. Well, that's how I feel it would work for me. I don't know if I should create a blog or something (I probably will) as I don't want to flood r/fasting with my posts every day.
I sure would love to talk to like minded people and share experiences with them.

Let me tell you what my nutritional strategy is.

**1) Eat healthier**
I have already adopted, and I'm constantly improving, suitable eating habits. and I'm just focusing on a few simple things really:

**a) Eat more protein.** LEAN meat, like chicken, fish is awesome too every now in a while, and I'm a big fan of any and all beans.

**b) Eat smaller meals.** Its amazing how little the human body needs to be full and working in proper order, I sure as hell didn't think about it much every time I ate. Now, I try to eat less and less every time. 

**c) Cut down on the sugars and carbs.** Anything that has flour or sugar on it, its a no go for me, same as potatoes. Of course fruits have sugar on them but they ""don't count"" (as much).

**d) Eat more fruits and vegetables.** Not too hard, considering how delicious they can be once you get used to it! In fact I have to be careful of not overeating these babies.

According to my scale I've lost 4.5 kg in about a  week.

BUT I will not be content with just that. I am looking to integrate fasting. I am working in my willpower and feel like 5/2 is the way to go for me right now.

I was looking into ways to integrate it into my daily life, and I'll most likely do it Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

I got one question though, when you guys do 5/2 you don't eat ANYTHING at all, right? You can drink non caloric fluids like water,tea and coffee, if I'm not mistaken.

Wish me luck!

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the encouragement, now I'm pretty freaking certain I'll make some kind of a blog or the like, as nearly everyday I got a new experience or idea to share and questions to ask!

New question: When I do create it, can I just share it here with you? or would that be considered ""Spamming""?"	t5_2s9dh	True

I'm feeling great, wondering why I didn't know about this sooner, why everyone doesn't do this.

I really enjoy reading daily entries on how peoples fasts are going, so that is what I'm going to try to do with this. Let me know if it's inappropriate to post a diary on how my fast is going here. 

I've previously done a 14 day water fast, along with shorter fasts before and after. I'm starting a 10 day fast, as I've got a wedding dress fitting on the 4th. It might end up being 12 or 13 days instead, but 10 is the minimum. My goal with fasting is weight loss, gaining willpower, and getting in touch with my body.

My water fast isn't truly just water, I'm having tea, coffee, and mio in my water. Maybe some broth if I'm going crazy. I will also be having vitamins when I feel my body really needs them. 

To get ready for the fast, I've been restricting and have been grazing rather than eat meals at a set time. One thing different already is that I've been dreaming of eating delicious food and waking up feeling very full, only to realize that I was asleep and am still hungry. 

Today is day 1, July 24th 2013. Headache already and feeling bloated but hungry. Do you guys take pain killers when on a fast, or do you find it hurts your stomach too much? 

Day 2, July 25th, 2013. Last night was rough. I was throwing up bile and had a killer migraine. Today my head isn't nearly as bad, but I can imagine it will be funny for a few days. I was so so low last night, and I feel really good today. Gotta remember to keep drinking; I'm not doing a dry fast, and I've got to keep my health up.

Day 3, July 26th, 2013. Found a conundrum yesterday. How do I cook for others without tasting for seasoning? Spitting still has calories. No one here through the day to taste for me, and I don't trust their palates haha. Going out to buy a variety of tasty teas.

Day 4, July 27th, 2013.I've been really good, hunger is starting to stop, energy is super high and sleep is minimal. 

Day 9, August 1st, 2013. I've been quite sick actually, sore throat, sneezing, coughing, and major stomach troubles. Like I've had the stomach flu. A lot of burning pain in my stomach and rushing to the bathroom every hour. It's been like this for days now. I had surgery on my stomach a while ago and I throw up blood every so often. I know I have ulcers and I think they're acting up, thus the burning pain. I think my body is trying to heal itself right now. When I throw up blood, I have to go on a liquid diet for a number of days. I'm thinking of fasting for even longer, until the 23rd.

I plan on doing 85+% water fasting, with occasional black coffee, teas. I’ve considered about doing some “calorie free” diet drinks like diet soda, or splenda in coffee, however I think this will only tempt me further to break my fast.  What do you guys think of this?

Thank you all, for your help. Special shout out to anon999000 and Almond_Milk for the inspiration.

**UPDATE:**  So, I ended up failing miserably on the first day, and was just too ashamed to report back to you all.  After talking with a few of you over PM's, I've started again, today, doing a 10-14 day fast.  This time I have actually gone ahead and removed all the items in my house [that would cause me to break my fast early.](http://imgur.com/p7ygmOK)

I'm debating between creating a new post. I may do so, once I'm closer to half way at least. Otherwise, reposting would just be ['substitution'](http://michaelhyatt.com/should-you-keep-your-goals-to-yourself.html).

Thank you all for the support!

**Background:** I am off work this week, so I decided to take this opportunity to fast. Since I can rest as much as I want, I decided to increase the duration from my normal 1 day to 3 days, and to change the intensity by doing a water fast instead of a fruit fast.

**Pre-fast Stats:** 182.1lbs / 6' 5"" (82.6kg / 196cm)

**Goals:**

1. Reset my appetite.


2. Purge toxins from my body.


3. Test my self-discipline.


4. Note: Weight loss is NOT a goal, just an unavoidable side effect.

**Day 0:** The day before the water fast, I did a brown rice fast to help ease me in. I did not restrict my portions, but I ate roughly 3 servings of 1.5 cups each. I had moderate headaches and nausea, and intense cravings for other foods. Wife says my mood was normal.

**Day 1:** Pretty easy day. Energy level was normal, although I did have mild lightheadedness and shaking. Took a 20 minute nap in the afternoon. Some joint and muscle pain. Around 7PM the stomach rumbles came back, along with an increase in heart rate. Wife says my mood was more playful than usual. Decided to go to bed early. Slept poorly, woke up with heart racing around 2AM. Drank some water, used the restroom, and went back to bed.

**Day 2:** Woke up feeling very strange. Quite lightheaded, heart rate still elevated. Decided to add some sea salt to my water in case it has something to do with my electrolytes. This seems to have helped. Created this post and got some feedback. Realized I was probably psyching myself out. Relaxed and had a good rest of the day.


**Day 3 (today):** Slept soundly through the night. Shakes and lightheadedness have subsided for the most part. Mild headache and moderate joint pain, but this could be from spending most of the day yesterday sitting down. Overall, I am happy with how I am feeling, although I am still looking forward to breaking my fast.

1353998283.0	13v1q6	Fasting Update: Day 1 of 5	littlewonder	12	3	14	"Background: I'm a 5'6"" female. I have been on the keto diet since April 2011. I went a little nuts on Thanksgiving (planned) and gained a lot of water weight. My weight before this week was 162. I anticipate that I'll lose a lot of that water this week, so my weight loss results probably won't be typical of the average faster. My fasting background has included several 1-2 days fasts, one 3 day fast and 16-8 fasts for long periods. This 5 day fast will be my longest, but I'm looking forward to it! For this fast, I've chosen to drink water, black coffee, tea and an occasional diet soda.

Goal: I hope to achieve some weight loss after the holidays and plan to keep a keen eye out for other positive effects.

Morning weight: 178.8 lbs

Evening weight: 175

Daily Activity:

* 9am - Woke up, drank coffee
* 6 miles/1.5 hours cardio (I'm training for a half-marathon in January) I didn't notice any significant change in my workout, but I usually don't eat until after 11am anyway
* 2pm - Hour nap. I ended up being exhausted after my workout which was weird. I usually have a ton of energy after cardio. Luckily, I don't have any more runs planned the remainder of this fast.
* 5pm - Got really, really thirsty. Indulged in a soda. I wished I had grabbed for the water instead.
* 7pm - Orchestra rehearsal. No change from usual.
* 9:30pm - Went out for drinks. I had water but enjoyed the company.

Overview: Today was normal for day one of a fast (for me). I wasn't hungry, though I was overly observant of food advertisements and pictures. I had a slight headache later in the afternoon, but it subsided. After my nap, my energy levels were fine.

Forecast: Tomorrow I have soccer in the afternoon and a bunch of friends over in the evening for food and beer. I plan on drinking more water than I did today."	t5_2s9dh	True

1375883950.0	1jvsuu	Reflections on my four day water fast.	Zahdia	11	1	2	"Hi! This is the longest I've done a water fast. I've previously done two day fasts at the beginning of every month since January, as sort of a physical reboot away from sugar/food cravings and because I feel more disciplined. I did a three day fast in July when I had wisdom teeth removed, but it was more due to a lack of appetite on the T3s. 

On this fast, I enjoy water, tea, and coffee (once). I walked 2-4 km a day. I also took magnesium, calcium, and iron supplements.

The first day was easy and I didn't have many cravings. 

The second day, I remained resolute, but needed coffee to keep my energy levels up. Coffee without milk is not something I enjoy drinking. I felt cold all day. I found it really hard to turn my brain off and sleep (a problem that I do not normally have).

The third day I felt much less hungry, but food cravings were dancing in my head. The walk to work was very slow as I lacked energy. I also almost passed out once (beyond a normal head rush), so I ingested some sea salt and some half salt. I took an iron pill with a swish of lemon; I've had some anemia problems in the past and fasting exacerbates this. I napped in the middle of the day for an hour. At night, my leg had a fierce pulse twitch and sleeping was hard.

The fourth day was really hard. I had no set day to end the fast as I was playing it by ear, so my brain kept trying to talk me into ending it. By the late afternoon, I resolved to keep it up to the end of day, but the hours passed by very, very slowly. I went to the grocery store to acquire coconut water and avocadoes and the smell of bread nearly did me in. I reminded myself that I'm gluten free anyway and gluten-free bread is gross compared to real bread and I carried on. In the evening, I lacked energy and found concentrating to be really hard. I've had the same issue with the ketogenic diet, where my brain never really adapts to running solely on ketones. I had bad dreams and tossed and turned all night. 

Today, I broke the fast with not-from-concentrate coconut water; it tastes sweet, but not overpoweringly so. I feel very warm and my brain has revved up again. I expect that my sleep will return to normal.

1365107743.0	1boooh	Fasting may have helped me heal from acid refulx	paulexander	11	0	20	"Just want to share my little story. Aside from the weight loss and other associated health benefits, one of the ideas I had when I started fasting, was to address the pains I was having from my recently diagnosed acid reflux. If anyone has suffered from it, they are familiar with what I am referring to. I know fasting is not an intended or documented solution to this problem, but i figured this would be a harmless test to see if it had any effect on me.

Aside from the direct pain one feels feels after eating, there can be an additional problem on the next day, as the esophagus cramps whenever you try to swallow, and food gets stuck right above the stomach. The burning and inflammation from the acid causes the muscles to lock tight, as the lining gets damaged. My doctor gave me the ""scared straight"" lecture on how there are documented cases where this has turned into esophageal cancer. Message received.

The reason I was interested in fasting was the documented benefits of reducing inflammation, as well as promoting healing, so I thought it was a good solution. More birds, one stone, you know... I decided to hold off on the medication (for now) and see if I could address the issue myself.

After 7 months of weekly fasting, I am happy to report that I have not had problems with the cramping anymore. Granted, I have done other things to preempt the *production* of acid (drinking ACV and watching the spiciness of my dinners), but letting my body take regular breaks from my modern diet has helped me feel A LOT better. 

Someday I'll get re-scanned, and then I'll get a good look and see if my esophagus has recovered from the damage I did. "	t5_2s9dh	True

I really like the idea of the Fast 5 plan.  Not having to worry about preparing special foods multiple times in a day and still being able to eat a normal meal with my family after work sounds great.  I haven't seen much on here about people using Fast 5, so I'd really appreciate some info from people that have experience with it OR why a different fasting program would help me shed some pounds.

A couple of you asked me to write a follow-up on [my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/16goz9/report_on_my_7day_fast/), so here's a quick update.


Pre-fast weight: 187

Immediate post-fast: 170

2-week post-fast: 173


For the first two days after the fast it was hard for me to eat large portions. This gradually improved (or worsened, depending on your perspective). I've made a conscious and sustained effort to dramatically reduce my consumption of sugar, bread and dairy -- but I still eat about as much food as I did before I started fasting. I just eat more veggies and meats. Until the weather improves and I can start running again, I plan to stick to this reduced-sugars diet. (If the three pounds I've gained are ""water weight,"" it seems like I'm doing an okay job at sustaining my belt size.)

My new long-term goal is to reach 155 - 160 by June. Given how well the fast worked, I might do another seven-day (or a series of shorter two-days) in March or April.

If you have any questions, please ask. Happy to fill in anything I might have missed."	t5_2s9dh	True

Due to a charitable event I'm assisting, I will need to eat on December 5th, but will start another two day fast the following day.

Water, coffee and tea will be consumed. This fast will not include vitamins, but future one's may.

Daily Activity:

* 6pm - Started decorating the tree. Had a quiet night with my husband at home.

Overview: I can't believe this was the last day. It certainly didn't seem like it, as today felt like any other 24 hour fast. I was asked to workout by a friend, but chose to decline, opting for tomorrow morning instead, after a light breakfast.

Small amounts of fat will be used, but your body will get most of its fuel from ""cannibalizing"" your muscles. Then, when you start eating again, you'll have less lean mass, making it easier to put on fat, and ultimately you'll be worse off than before. 

I'd like to ask people who have fasted for periods of more than one day to comment on the ""starvation mode"" theory.

Is it complete bullshit?
Is it 90% bullshit, but contains a kernel of truth?
Is it true?
Is it true, but only for the first three days of the fast, after which your body starts getting most of its fuel from fat?

In the past, I have gone a couple of days without eating and upon eating again, I have returned to healthy eating and have felt both physically and mentally better. If all goes well, I hope to do longer fasts in the future, probably juice fasts.

The only thing I am wondering is something that people keep telling me in regards to fasting, that my body will go in to ""starvation mode"" and end up actually gaining weight. I do not want to gain weight. Is this likely to happen?

Also, does anybody want to do this with me? If not, it would be great if somebody sort of ""checked up"" on me as I think this would be easier to do if I had some sort of pressure to do so.

I'm on day 8 of my month-long water fast (started on the 1st July and end of the 31st) in order to kickstart some weight loss and attempt to break my addiction to sugar and binge/purge/restrict cycle.

I haven't weighed myself yet but will do so at the end of the month, I feel that I get discouraged to keep going if the scale doesn't say what I want it to.

The first few days was hard but after that it was okay - I have to say the hardest part is when I'm invited for lunch/dinner with friends and have to miss out or play sick, as I feel uncomfortable telling people what I'm doing as the general population just doesn't understand! 

Any questions for people doing a water fast or wanting to start one - I'm happy to answer!

1364334382.0	1b2hdd	I'm going to water fast for 7 to 14 days to lose weight, depending on how I feel.  Anyone interested in me keeping track of my progress?	UltraNG	15	6	29	"I'm around 30 pounds overweight and have decided to fast to cut some pounds.  I know what intermittent fasting is but I am not going to do that.  I'm going to straight up water fast until I hit my goal weight.  The only thing I will consume will be water and daily vitamins on this fast. 


My initial goal is to lose 8 pounds as I'm on dietbet and in order to win my bet, I have to cut 8 pounds in 4 weeks but I waited until the last minute to cut the weight.  I now have only 10 days to lose a remaining 6 pounds and the fastest way to do that is to fast.  I figure that if I'm feeling well enough, I will continue the fast until I reach my goal weight of 175.  I'm already on day two of my fast and all is well.


So I guess I'm writing this post to see if anyone would be interested in my results and if there is anything special that someone wants me to do during this fast in tracking my progress?  I haven't started tracking anything yet other than my starting weight and dietbet picture.  If enough people are interested, I'll take pictures and video myself along the way.


**Edit (End of Day 2, March 26 around 11:59pm):**  I took a self picture but I'm too ashamed to post it even if I black out my face.  I'll post it at the end of my fast to get a before and after.  I'm also new to using reddit so I hope I'm posting the pictures right.  Below is the picture of my weight on a scale at the end of day 2 and the other picture is of the Vitamins that I'm taking.  I am predicting that I'll lose at least 1 pound a day, maybe even 2.   Also, I did not go to the gym like I said I would.  I think it was the feeling of being tired that made me not want to go as that is a side effect of your body switching completely over from carbs to fat as energy.

**Vitimins (Why I'm taking them)**

http://www.imagebam.com/image/e28709245682046

First off, I do not take these vitimins all at the same time.  It will be throughout the day so that I don't mix them as that could cause an adverse side effect.  The most important Vitimin is potassium as it regulates the heart beat.  On an extended fast, if you deplete your body of potassium it can cause an irregular heart beat which can lead to sudden death, this is rare but something you should be aware of when doing a long fast.  In other words, your heart will spontaneously beat super fast at an uncontrollable rate or super slow at an an uncontrolled rate.  I take Vitimin E for skin elasticity, hoping to reduce stretch marks and excess skin.  However, skin elasticity depends on age a lot more than anything else.  I take the 1 a day multivitimin just in case I might have missed anything else important and the Omega-E  fish oil just because I hear that it's good for you.  :)


**Edit  (Day 3, Still in progress)**  Woke up and weight myself at around 7:30 am.  I was 1 pound lighter at 203.1.  I have not exercised at all in the past 5 days and the most exercise I have been getting in the past 5 days has been walking to my car or typing on the keyboard.  Someone mentioned something in the comments below and it made me think back on day 1 and day 2, hunger.  Hunger seems to come in waves.  It is not a persistent creature.  Next time I experience the need to eat food, I'll time it to see how long it lasts.  So far, I have noticed that hunger/food cravings for me would stem from a time of stress especially if I'm playing a competitive video game.  

**Edit (Day 3, Afternoon Workout)**  Before going to the gym I weight at 203.1.  Went to the gym at 1:30pm and did a 2 mile jog on the treadmill at 4.5mph, which is about 12 mins per mile.  It's pretty slow, I know.  After that I did 3 sets(12 reps per set) of deadlifts at 100 pounds, 3 sets of pulldown bars at 100 pounds, and 3 sets of pushups at 20 each.  Came home and weight at 204.6, which I attribute to the 3 bottles of water I had during my jog at 16.9 ounces per bottle but I am still expecting to be under 203.1 by tomorrow morning after I pee.  I'm not a professional so if someone has a better resistance training routine, I'm all open ears.  I need to do some type of muscle activity to remind my body not to use it as energy.  Also, I did experience a slight need to eat something after my 2 mile jog but it only lasted for like a min.  I just headed off to the weights after that.

**Edit  (End of Day 3, 11pm)** Been weighting myself throughout the day, especially after going to the gym and to my delight I am at 201.8 pounds.  So in a full 24 hours fasting with some exercise at the gym, I was able to cut somewhere around 2.3 pounds.  I can say I was only hungry once today and that was after my 2 mile jog but there has been some temptations of food being all around me, especially leftover poboy and fries on the table.  Smells so good but when I got on the scale and saw that I lost a pound after my workout, it gave me more motivation to continue.  Sorry poboy, you don't beat me today!  Tomorrow, I'm expecting the same results as long as I exercise.  Also, taking a picture now to post at the end.

**Edit (Day 4 Morning, 7:30am)**  So as I was laying in bed last night, I was wondering to myself why I was doing this.  Why not just eat all the foods that I love?  Why not just give in.  I don't know really.  Nothing horrible seems to be happening right now on this morning of day 4.  I'm feeling fine, not tired, alert, and energetic.  First thing I did when I woke up was weight myself again, this time at 200.6 pounds which means I lost a pound in my sleep again.  In case some are wondering, I did weight myself before I took a piss and I have never in my life pissed a whole pound of water away.  In fact, my scale never seems to register the weight of my piss.  This is interesting to me as the record keeping from day 2 to end of day 3 would suggest that a majority of weight loss happens in my sleep and after exercising.  I know that both sleep and exercise increases HGH proteins for fat burning but then I also know that fasting in general does the same thing.  What I don't know is, how long the body can maintain an elevated level of HGH proteins in a fasted state and if a fasted state increases HGH protein levels even more during sleep and exercise.  Maybe someone here knows?  I wonder if there is somewhere I can go to get my blood work checked out.  Anyway, off to day 4.  Hope I make it!


**Edit  (Day 4 lunch time)**  I'm going to break my fast.  Yeah, i didn't make a full 7 days.  I'm not breaking it because I'm hungry or feeling any side effects.  In fact I feel just fine.  I'm breaking it because I just want to eat!  lol  But, I'm going to incorporate a more stable intermittent fasting plan.  Most likely a combination of leangains and 5/2.  Does anyone want me to update my progress on my switch over?  I'll leave whatever I have posted above as a reference for anyone who might want to do something similar.


**April 3**  After my fast ended, my parents came over and brought with them a lot of food and I ate it all.  I didn't eat it all because I was hungry, it's just the way I've always ate.  If you know what Pho is, I ate 3 large bowls of Pho in a day and gained most of my weight back but what I found interesting is that it seems to me that a lot of weight lost in those three days were probably related to carbs as your muscles and liver holds carbs.  When you eat carbs, your body binds carbon molecule with the water that you drink and stores it inside of your body which is what I believe where the weight came from after eating those 3 bowls.  When your muscles and liver run out of places to put the carbs, it will overflow into your gut and other unwanted places in your body.  I believe those 3 big bowls of carbs was more than my muscles could handle as I am sure I could feel some of it being deposited in my gut but maybe I just imagined it?  I believe my weight was 209 the next day after I ate those three bowls.

Anyway, I'm still in dietbet and need to cut down to 203 to win my first bet.  After that one bad day, I've been following Leangain's intermittent fasting protocol but only doing it the half ass way.  What I mean by that is, I'm suppose to first fast, then eat 15 mins before my workout, and finally eat a normal meal.  My fasting and meal timing has been a little sporadic but I mainly eat everyday but only after 3pm which means I basically skip breakfast and lunch.  For dinner, I just eat lots of protein because I read that your body doesn't use the extra protein.  You just end up peeing it out.  My dinner has been mainly fish as I like the taste over beef, pork, or chicken.  I just feel that if I'm going to eat only once a day, i'm going to eat good!  So I buy myself salmon and shimp.  heh  Since that time, I am down to 202.6 and I only go to the gym 2 or 3 times a week.  My weight-in for my bet is tomorrow and I've fasted all day since my weight was on the borderline from the other night.  I know from my previous fasting experience that I can drop 2 pounds of weight in a day so that's what I'm doing to ensure I make the cut for tomorrow morning.

**April 8**  My weight in for Dietbet was a few days ago on April 3.  It took two days for them to verify everyone's weight in and I won 66 dollars.  I bought into the pot for 35$.  I basically doubled my money to lose some weight which is pretty cool.  After the weight in, I was 202 pounds and gained a good 4 extra pounds the day after just by loading up on carbs.  I saw some fruit rollups on the table and ate two whole boxes of them.  It was so yummy.  Anyway, I have another weight-in on April 9 and have to drop 1 pound for that.  Not going to be hard since I'm familiar with how to drop 2 pounds in a day if you read my previous post.  I really like the small incentive i get for losing weight over at Dietbet so I decided to join another one.  It might not be a lot of money but it's just fun to have that incentive there pushing you to do what you have to do."	t5_2s9dh	True

I am glad I found this subreddit. I'm not new to fasting; about a year ago I would go on fasts often, and I also experimented with IF. I liked the feeling of control, of not giving in to urges to eat junk food. It also influenced me to eat healthier when I *did* eat.

The problem... I recently got a job 3 days a week that requires a lot of physical activity (we walk 15-20 miles a day) and it has wreaked havoc on my ability to fast. My coworkers tend to stop at cheap chain restaurants and chow down on pizza or something during the lunch break... And I've had trouble resisting the temptation to do so.

My other issue is that I have depression, and when I'm depressed I tend to eat a lot. I'm not overweight (I'm normal weight, just skirting the line to underweight because I'm really tall) but because of winter depression I've put on a lot of weight due to depressed eating. 


Thank you for reading, if you did read this... and if you didn't want to, tl;dr, I'm going on my first three-day water/juice fast in a while, and I need some encouragement to not eat junk food with coworkers, or by myself when I'm depressed.

I'm curious to know what evidence is there to support one food over another. More importantly the difference between cooked and raw. 


From what I understand, fasting diminishes our digestive capabilities and enzymes, therefore its important to ease into food gradually. So wouldn't thoroughly cooked food fit the bill, since cooking/heat acts as a sort of pre-digestion? Isn't eating raw (especially raw vegetables) worse for digestion?

12:00pm Finished up class and walked over to a Starbucks on campus for another black coffee. Have you ever had one of those days where nothing will keep you awake? Today in a nutshell. Walked to my other class and finished coffee there. 

4:00pm Finished class for the day and biked over to the gym. (About a 5 minute ride? Aka, very short, and not enough to work up a sweat.) Worked the rowing machine for 20 minutes, squats with 90lbs, then some ab work really quick. Finished up and biked home.

5:30pm Realized I hadn't eaten all day, still didn't feel hungry. Went to a meeting, and biked downtown and back home.

11:00pm Aha! More than 24hrs on a fast without even realizing it! Feels good man. Planning on sleeping at Midnight, waking up at 8:00, and biking over to my class that's from 8:00am-12:00pm.

Starting weight: 178.8 lbs

Morning weight: 164.8

Evening weight: 164

Daily Activity:

* 10am - Woke up, drank coffee. Ran to the store.
* 12pm - Lunch with my husband. No cravings. Had a soda.
* 3pm - Preschool soccer. No problems with energy.
* 5:30pm-8:15pm - Class. I had coffee. It was hard because it falls during the dinner hour and I usually grab some cheese cubes and pepperoni slices to tide me over until afterward. My husband and I also usually grab wings at BWW after class on the way home, so I had INTENSE cravings for wings. Luckily, he talked me out of it and I am still on my fast. That was rough.

Overview: Had the worst cravings I've had today. Other than that, today was pretty uneventful.

Forecast: Tomorrow I get to sleep in. I have some more work for my home business in the afternoon. Nothing planned in the evening. Should be an easy end to my little fasting adventure.

Why is this a common belief that (sarcasm here)... that if I skip breakfast my body is now in starvation mode and I'm about to die?  This makes me mad.

I have school and work five days a week. The first few days were super easy, but come days 5 &amp; 6 (today and yesterday) my energy has been low and fatigue is high. I've read a lot about people who get to this point and get a burst of energy... where's mine?

Work is a desk job (not too hectic or energetic) but as a college student I do a decent amount of walking--I figure this is good. It's exercise but it's not strenuous. 

I've been somewhat hungry, but the real reason for wanting to cave is not cravings or hunger--it's the headaches and fatigue, which I thought would be gone. 

Tomorrow is day 7. At the very least, I want to push to 10 days if I can't do two weeks. 

Anyone have any insight or personal experiences/anecdotes to share? Encouragement and motivation also welcomed :)

My goal is to lose weight, get healthier and cut off the junk I eat (so far it's working, I only crave meat and veggies!) I've been on it for a week and tbh plan on making it a lifestyle change (maybe cut the fast down to 2-3 days a week).

My question is, will this continue to burn fat/help me get healthier and to lose weight for a prolonged period of time (4 months), or will there reach a point where I permanently plateau and my eating habits will become maintenance, not weight loss? I have some ideas in mind if such a thing should happen (fat fast, water fast, juicing etc) but I'd still like to know how long I can keep this up for the sake of weight loss. I'm about 50 pounds overweight btw.

I've head about the Protein Sparing Modified Fast, and tried to read up on it as much as I can, but what I'm envisioning is a tiny bit different. How well does that work on shorter intermittent fasts?

I started out doing the 5:2 calorie restricted, and then moved on to water-only fasts. Occasionally, I'll do a good three day water-only fast when I want to drop a little more fat. I've been progressing slowly (on purpose) and am now down 30 pounds from when I started 9 months ago. It's hard for me to tell, as I have no idea how to properly chart my muscle mass; I *may* or *may not* have lost some muscle mass... I've switched my workout to mostly HIIT, and backed off on the resistance training for a little while. Sometimes I feel weaker, but that could be due to low glycogen (HIIT). Sometimes I feel stronger.
 
Anyway, I'm a little concerned about protein loss on the third day, and was wondering if the intake of protein after the second day would preempt muscle loss (proteolysis), or is my body just going to take it from the muscles regardless?

I've been wanting to lose weight for a while now, but between work (which is mostly lifting, so there's some exercise there) and school, various projects etc. there is little time for regulated exercise. I'm not fat really, but I'm ""built"" like a skinny person and have always lead a sedentary lifestyle, so I carry almost all of my weight in my belly/ass/thighs. Fasting seems like a good way to supplement the exercise I am getting at work without spending a lot of money on totally revamping my diet. (College leaves me with NO disposible income, haha.) 

The thing is, I suffer from insomnia most nights, and so my sleep/eating schedule is a little off-kilter to begin with. For the past week or so, before really diving into this subreddit, I've experimented with going a while without food, just drinking coffee/water/tea, but never with any kind of explicit time management or conscious planning, anything like that.

I should note I knew next to nothing about it when I started last week except basically *don't eat; drink water* and that's sustained me so far, though today i've decided it might be a good idea to finally educate myself. Duh, I know. I had headaches/felt weak and sick the 2nd and 3rd day but from a cursory look at some posts here that seems normal now though it concerned me at the time. Anyway i'm rambling when I just should ask for tips on the best way to break a 7 day water-only fast. I'm wondering how easy it is and will I feel sick/not be able to keep it down. Any advice? 

-A side question might be if it's OK to exercise during this - I usually do push-ups/crunches/pull-ups and continued that regimen into the first two days of the fast but quit after I started feeling sick with the headaches and became concerned.

I come from an abusive childhood and my mother had many issues, mostly revolving around drugs. I am doing this to cleanse myself of my past once and for all. Its time to start living in the present and dreaming for the future. I will make my first progress post at a couple minutes before midnight on Tuesday. I am starting a small goal fast first- which will be 7 days. I will then juice and get my required nutrients for 3-4 days after. Then I will see if I can continue another 7 days, and so on. I will not go more than 30 days. And yes, I know how to properly break a fast, so I will be sure to keep that discipline following afterwards. Would love to post here with my progress as I feel this really helps me with my motivation.

First, I have a question.

How do you avoid temptation when the family you live with are very big eaters, and much against fasting? Do I have to be stern, or stealthy?"	t5_2s9dh	True

I also have practiced 19-5 IF on and off for a few weeks. But lately, when I've attempted a 24 hour fast I've just gotten too hungry and ran out of willpower... The first day I thought it was because of a heavy weightlifting session in the morning, but further attempts with no real exercise had the same results. On fast days/times I have a couple of cups of black coffee in the mornings, and usually some broth or hot tea in the afternoons (my normal eating window has been 3-8pm, but that might change due to my work schedule). I also have a vitamin and omega-3 supplement daily. Any advice on keeping my willpower and staving off hunger? In addition to hunger I feel light-headed, weak, sometimes nauseated, and ""fuzzy"" like I'm not thinking clearly. Bit sometimes I feel slightly euphoric and very relaxed. I've never felt energetic while fasting. Any thoughts? I would really like to eventually be able to do a 48-72 hour fast. Female, 5'4, 150lbs, 28 years old.

1358459366.0	16ryf2	Still hungry on Day 5 of a pure water fast?	Almond_milk	9	2	9	I am embarking on a 30 day water fast. I am currently on day 5. This being my first fast, I had done a lot of research about what to expect prior to beginning. I read that after the first three days, your digestive system shuts down and you should no longer feel hungry. So then why is my stomach still grumbling on day 5? I haven't chewed any gum, taken any vitamins or pills, even used toothpaste as all these things can spark unwanted digestion. So that's not the issue. Maybe the hunger could be because I have been active. As much as I would love to rest during the fast, out of absolute necessity I have had to resume my normal schedule (full time graduate student with a job). Anyone have any similar experiences or any information to shed light on this? Thanks!	t5_2s9dh	True

It will be at least a 10 day water fast, personally I am aiming for 21 days, but 10 days are a must, for me. I am starting at 00:00 GMT+2 and I would be happy if someone would join me (for how long you can).I did water fasts before, but recently I had some very, very bad family, financial problems and I went to food, for comfort. The biggest mistake I could do because I didn't even realize that I ate so much in such a short period of time.I am in a really bad place right now and I want to prove myself that I can do this. The first 3 days I will try and drink 8L of water and I should mention that I will take a pill of vitamin supplement everyday. (In the daily requirements, not passing that). If you want to join me, let me know and I will post everyday so this will be a log as well. Thanks for your time!	t5_2s9dh	True

Updates:

0045 - Going great so far! Not hungry yet.

1000- Earl Grey tea for breakfast. I was afraid I would wander into the kitchen when I woke up and eat something accidentally forgetting I'm fasting. That didn't happen though.

1730 - A little hungry, but mostly from boredom, I think. I have the day off and I'm feeling lazy.

2300 - I feel fine. Whenever I drift off to sleep, though, I'm dreaming of food. Laying down for sleep, I had some esophageal discomfort from stomach acid. Took some antacids.

3200 - All my dreams are about food. I forget I'm fasting and eat something and then I remember.  Feels shitty.  Still going strong in real life, though.  Not terribly hungry yet - just thinking of food when bored.

4620 - Took a slow 18mi bicycle ride. I keep thinking of food, but I don't feel too physically hungry. I think tomorrow will be tough.

I need to stay awake during work, and currently this is the only method! I've been through a sleep study, had nasal surgery, and I've taken a variety of pills, and I always end up crashing after 4 or 5 hours from when I wake up.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

**TL:DR:**I can fit fasting into my schedule, but I'm concerned that my sleeping habits might require me to drink energy drinks. Is that a no no ?

Additionally, Pilon mentions muscles relying on glycogen for energy, separate from fat you burn from fasting.  That being said, is the timing of a workout indifferent?  Or is there an optimal time to workout in coordination with a fast?

Ive been drinking around 1gallon (is this too little??) water a day. Not experiencing any especially positive effects at all...

The weird part: i have no idea whether i'm into ketosis yet, this being my first fast, and I wouldn't know what to expect. I have been having -- well, not 'pangs' of hunger, but intense stomach contractions/rumbling, and quelling them by downing a lot of water. This has been going on all 3 days. Today, the third day, this feeling started to go away and I haven't been very hungry. But I still want to eat, even though i'm not physically hungry. I don't know how else to explain it--it's the idea of food, the images of it, I don't know.

1334324343.0	s7wef	still hungry on day 4	miconian	8	1	14	"Technically it's almost the end of day 4, since the last time I ate was Monday afternoon. My stomach is still grumbling, and I'm very irritable and low-energy. The problem is definitely not lack of water, as it's only 9:30am and I've already had over half a gallon. I added some sea salt a few minutes ago for the first time, and that gave me a little boost, but perhaps that was psychosomatic or just calories from the salt.

It's rather difficult to concentrate on my work, and I'm having doubts as to whether long-term fasting is for me. Although I'm not technically hypoglycemic, I do have ""reactive hypoglycemia,"" i.e. small fluctuations in my blood sugar have a huge affect on my mood and energy levels. I almost punched a few people earlier this morning, and right now I'm just sitting here staring at my screen, accomplishing nothing. 

I started out at 200 lbs (I'm a 5'9"" male), and this morning the scale said 195. So, that's great, and I like the idea of continuing to use IF for weight loss, but I'm not sure a long term fast is for me. Also, if I can't get out of my co-op shift tomorrow, then I'm going to be working in grocery aisles on my feet for 3 hours, and I'm not sure how well that's going to work out.

Day 1: Didn't notice any difference but I *always* randomly do a day fast at least 1-2 days a week minimum.

Day 2: The worst traits began to surface and sleep was uneven, I felt more grumpy, agitated, forgetful, and careless than usual.

Day 3: Just call me Kal-El, day 3 was the polar opposite of the day before, I had leaps of energy and felt better than ever.

The surprise for me is that all feelings of hunger stopped on day 3 and I felt I could easily have gone another day w/out thinking about it.

My fasting regimen consisted of:

* Water, lots of it. During the 65 minute workouts (plus walking to/from gym), I would drink a 24 oz bottle of a Contigo canister I fill at the gym.

* Coffee. I typically drink 1-2 cups a day but cut down more each day during a fast; I find as my body cleans out, caffeine has a much larger, dramatic effect so less is more.

* Resveratrol. It's basically red wine extract w/out the alcohol.

* Psyllium Fiber. Nature's broom, this is great during a fast as it helps 'bounce' anything not leaving.

* Green tea. My favorite is Genmaicha.

Consult your personal physician before beginning any serious fasting and always drink and carry **PLENTY OF WATER**. Regardless of the type of fast you take (water, juice, etc.), hydration is critical to life.

Obligatory [Wikipedia link on fasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting). Best lines from article: ""Research suggests there are major health benefits to caloric restriction. Benefits include reduced risks of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, insulin resistance, immune disorders, and more generally, the slowing of the aging process, and the potential to increase maximum life span."" For this inaugural post, I'll share my own experiences and explain why I wanted to start this subreddit. 

Back in college, on my way to work one day and spinning the radio dial, I began listening to a broadcast from an AME church in Los Angeles all about fasting. Beside great oration, they were citing everything from the bible to history to science to make the case for fasting. Like a lot of life changes for me, this had an incubation effect and a few days later at my local swap-meet, I found a copy of Paul C. Bragg's ""The Miracle of Fasting"" and I was hooked.

Fast forward many years and a rounder physique and I dug out my old book for renewed inspiration. However, one of the things that dogged me (&amp; others) in the past is the lack of a good support system. One of the great rules of a good fast is to not boast about one's own condition, especially something to the effect, ""I can't! I'm too tired! I'm fasting!"" However, it is my hope that this subreddit could be a place of support for fellow-fasters.

If you are fasting for health, bravo! If you are fasting for weight loss, I urge caution. Fasting is not fast. I would never suggest it as a tool to anyone dieting unless it was for a set period as part of their greater program.

Last year around this time I started developing huge motivation to get in shape, mainly because I have a bum heart, and to stay alive more than a few years I needed to get my resting heart rate way down (this is an oversimplification, but good enough for right now). I decided to work out during warm months and diet during the cold months, mainly because I also have some nerve damage that has left me particularly sensitive to cold weather. I work out 5x a week during the warm months and this past winter I went on the keto diet and lost roughly 30 pounds. I've never been fat, but I was admittedly a small amount overweight, and it felt good to get some off.

Unfortunately now with it being warm, I'm in the exercise phase of my regimen, and so I've been on a bulk. But I really don't like the feel of gaining fat. I don't at all hate my body, but I know how I'd like to improve it. So I'm hopping on a water diet to lose a quick 10 pounds before hopping back into exercising.

Because I like coffee so much, I made the deal with myself that I could still have coffee as long as I never pushed above 100 calories (I enjoy my coffee with a small amount of milk, no sugar, so 100 calories is admittedly a lot; I believe that would take about 6 oz of 2% milk) a day. Otherwise, just water and a daily multivitamin. I've also agreed that if I felt woozy that I would first try a shot of lemon juice for a quick boost of electrolytes, then start going for protein heavy options, but knowing my body I don't think I'll have to. I'm already used to eating 900-1000 calories for a few months from my last diet phase, so I don't think I'll wimp out.

But regardless, I don't have any experience in full-on fasting. I naturally skip out on food some days just from not being hungry, but I've never gone more than about 36 hours without food on purpose. Is there anything I should know while I'm first jumping in?

Also, I'll be using this thread to document my fast. I hope nobody minds."	t5_2s9dh	True
1373511266.0	1i1zrv	[conversation] What benefit or purpose are you seeking with a 30 day water fast? Safe?	nikiverse	10	2	10	"Hello, I'm a new subscriber to this subreddit, but I have read about and done quite a few fasts in my day. 

I'm seeing a lot of posts about 30 day water fasts. I am a huge fan of Dr. Joel Fuhrman and he has done a lot of amazing things with his medical fasts. But anything that's going to last a month long, he has that patient stay under supervision. 

I have always read that 1-3 days is a good enough length of time for water fasts. I have personally done a 7 day water fast. 

I'm just curious why someone would do a medically unsupervised 30 day water fast? Or maybe, what benefit are you getting for a 30 day water fast that you wouldnt get from a 3 day water fast or even a 7 day water fast? 

Maybe I'm confused on what a 30 day water fast consists of here (I've heard people say they are water fasting ... but find out they are actually eating or drinking calories. To me, that's not a water fast). But a 30 day water fast, woo, I've honestly never have heard anyone suggest that unless they were on the old pro-ana/mia websites. I have read absolutely zero literature on fasting that suggests 30 day water fasts (edit: this is false. I should have inserted ""medically unsupervised""). Everything I've read suggests nothing longer than 7 days, max. Most suggest 3 days. If you do the month long ""fasts"", books I read suggest getting that 800 cals through juicing or fruit/veggies. 

I really am not trying to attack. (I do have preconceived notions if your answer is purely to ""lose weight""). But I'm curious about other reasons (like religious or spiritual, etc). Also, if anyone has comments about ""detoxing"", I'm curious about what literature you've read. Or what influenced you to go the fasting route to detox.

The calories ingested put me at a ~3500cal/week deficit (not including calories burned from workouts) 

I have a personal trainer who isn't open to fasting and really gets on my case if i train fasted. I've re-arranged things a bit and now have ingested 800-1000 calories before my lunchtime workout.   Conventionally he tells me I need to eat to get stronger.  


I'm open to criticism and input... (or validation if this seems ok) 

Current stats are 35M, 6ft2, 202lbs, 25%bf.

I've lost about 20lbs over  the course of a year. Not really counting calories. The first 10lbs came off quick when I picked up fasting (usually 1 day a week, sometimes 2) I've had a couple months where I stayed the same weight but my lifts went up.  I've had some wild swings recently and that's when I got serious about food logging and calorie counting. I'm hoping I can lose 4lbs per month for the next 3 months by counting the calories closely. But I also don't want to waste effort and $ in the gym by not giving my body enough calories for an optimal recovery."	t5_2s9dh	True

So for this organization I work for, The Supply, we are hosting our annual event called Lunch for Lenana. (come check it out here! http://www.facebook.com/events/502514489789943/ haha shameless self promotion) anyway, its for a GREAT cause, but that is not why I am posting here right now.

Basically what I've decided to do is instead of giving up just my lunch, I am going to give up all my meals and I figured I need some advice.

Originally I planned to do this with just water, but looking around online I found that this can potentially damage my body and organs. I am not worried about whether or not I will lose weight from this, nor am I willing to sacrifice eating to this degree if it will damage my body.

I am willing to eat any kind of liquid as long as it isn't solid food. I planned to drink protein, but I saw online that that isn't good either. Please help me out :). This is my first time fasting.

Thanks guys!"	t5_2s9dh	True

my problem is weekends. i usually wake up at 10-11am on the weekends and would like to knock out the gym session early, but i feel like my workouts suffer if i workout fasted.

what would be best fasting schedule be for me? should i just do warrior diet and eat only 1 meal(post workout)? i find that without food prior to the gym, my workouts stink and im so weak :(

my primary goal is to build strength while maintaining lean and im currently on a 5 day split.

day 1: chest

day 2: upper back

day 3: primarily squats and calves

day 4: cardio

day 5: deadlifts - primarily lower back, glutes, hamstrings

day 6: shoulders

I would like to lose about 10 pounds, but my main reason for fasting is to challenge myself. My last meal was on Sunday night at 7. Monday evening I felt pretty hungry but it wasn't too bad and I felt fine when I went to bed. Tuesday morning I felt great; I was full of energy and felt much less tired than I normally do in the morning. During the day on Tuesday I felt normal. Then started at about 6PM I started to feel extremely hungry. By about 8PM I was feeling very weak and tired. I ended up going to bed at about 10PM, which is much earlier than normal for me. When I got up at 7AM on Wednesday, I felt extremely groggy and weak. I could barely get up at all. It almost felt like I was really sick or something, but I didn't have any other symptoms other than being very weak. I figured that there was no way I could get through the day like that, so I gave in and had a big breakfast. While I was eating, I felt a weird burning sensation in my throat, but afterwards my throat felt fine. For a couple hours after this I felt pretty nauseous but after that I felt much better. I had a normal sized lunch but then started feeling pretty tired. After my last class at 3 I went home and took a 2 hour nap. After that I had a normal size dinner and afterwards I felt pretty much normal again. Is this normal? Should I attempt another 72 hr fast soon, or should I do more 24 and 48 hr fasts to prepare myself?	t5_2s9dh	True

1347414549.0	zqruf	Fainting During Water-Fast?	JonathanAshleyMoore	9	2	13	"So here's my deal. I did a fast where I only consumed Water, Diet-Coke and Powerade-Zero a few weeks back. I was pretty fine. Light headed, as is expected, until the fourth day where I was so exhausted, depleted and my blood pressure was so low that I almost fainted.

I thought I went wrong somewhere down the line and I either didn't drink enough water or my potassium or sodium stores were depleted (or electrolytes, whatever, I'm not going to pretend I know what I'm talking about when I talk about those things).

So I did another four day water-fast... except I only got two and a half days in, woke up and went to my kitchen, remember saying ""Nan, I don't feel good"" and then fell to the floor.

I drank only water for the two and a half days, I didn't take multi-vitamins, no salt, powerade-zero or anything. Pure water. I'm pretty sure regardless I have slightly low blood pressure. Now, if any of you have a slight intuition about this, did I faint because of low blood pressure, or low blood sugar... or?

I just can't figure it out. If you have to ask questions to get a better idea, go ahead. I'll answer. But I'd just like to know I guess. I have no doubt that water-fasting has definite benefits for people, but not for me. I get too light-headed and dizzy.

(started at 234 lbs now 222lbs) (kinda long)	fattyfaster	7	2	6	"Hi, i'm honestly not sure if this will come in handy but i'm currently on day 6 of a water* only fast  and thought i would share my experience up to now for any one who may be in my position. 

* Male
* 5ft 9 
* 234lbs
* Walking between 1-7 miles a day during fast (avg 3) 

before the fast i did as much research as i could get my hands on, how to ease myself into longer fasts how to recover from them etc. with much thought i decided its time to get my arse into gear and get cracking. 

* Day 1: Had been on liquid diet for a few days but celebrated the start of my fast by going to a party the night before (bad idea) so spent day 1 hungover drinking water.
* Day 2: Kept hands and mind busy as much as possible no real hunger pains to speak of.
* Day 3: DAS HUNGER, woke up feeling hungry and it only got worse as the day went on as much as i kept busy it was always there so i attempted to mute it by drowning it out didn't really work.
* Day 4: same as day three in every way but one, this day comes with a lovely headache.
* Day 5: Woke feeling pretty dam spry with no hunger and only a slight tinge of head pain day went well.
* Day 6: today: same as day five no hunger and a nice little increase in energy did smell fresh baked bread in the supermarket and that kinda felt like someone shanked me but fine other than that all is well.

I want to be &lt;200lbs by the end of the fast and i think i can do it. i have lost 12 lbs already i know most is water weight but even having the weight of me makes me feel better and more confident.

Water* tiny cheating by me, water is dull it really is so i bought some flavoured water that comes in at 10kcal per liter 0.5 g of carbs, i drink maybe a liter a day along with normal water, to counter these evil ten calories i make a point of walking to the supermarket which is 5 miles there and back (approx 500 kcal burnt).

This may be a bit long winded and pointless to 99% but i hope it helps someone who may be thinking of taking the same path as me.

I've read that it's advisable to sleep a lot during the fast. Is this necessary? Also, I don't plan on working out at all, but I might be doing a lot of walking. Is this okay?

Finally, I'm mainly doing this fast because I've been having a lot of GI problems recently, and I'm really looking for a reset on my digestive tract. Have you had good experiences with this?

*Day 3, 6/4/2012 9pm:* Great day!  Didn't feel hungry at all, but instead felt very full - at times too full, as though I'd eaten a huge meal.  This is pretty typical for my third day of a fast, but I don't know why it happens.

*Day 4, 6/5/2012 9pm:* Still feeling good and not feeling hungry, which is weird for me on day four.  I've decided to make this a six-day fast, since many people in this thread are ending their fasts Thursday and we can finish at the same time this way!

*Day 6, 6/7/2012 12pm:* Last day, and so far not the best.  Woke up with a headache, and smells of coworkers' foods have been making me feel pretty hungry.  Gotta hang on a bit longer!

Thanks for humoring me, /r/fasting - the fact that I was posting here actually helped me over a couple slumps.

I can eat again today, but as you all know, reintroducing food after a fast is something to do carefully.  I'm going to drink some fruit juices when I next feel hungry (but not before), and then move to raw fruits and veggies.  I won't go over 500 calories today, 1000 calories tomorrow, and then I'll be back to my normal 1300 per day.  Thanks again for the help, everyone!

1332550353.0	rat0l	My first fast ever		9	0	1	"Just wanted to share my experience. On Wednesday afternoon I realized that I hadn't had anything but coffee since Tuesday evening, and all I had for dinner that night was a smoothie, so I decided to keep it up and try fasting for a day or two. Mostly it was out of curiosity and to see how my body handled it. I'm not a big believer in detox or cleansing, although I do believe fasting can have health benefits. I don't think I need to lose weight. I've always been about the same since high school and I'm sure I'll bounce back the three pounds I dropped very quickly. I had a tablespoon of honey on the first night because I read something about a honey fast on the internet, but after that I decided to just drink water, tea, and black coffee. 

On Thursday, the second day, I was really hungry and had trouble focusing at work. I just felt kind of edgy and anxious. Part of that might have been having nothing but coffee in the morning. I also had some kind of background headaches. The toughest part was finding things to keep me occupied in the evening. Usually that's when I'm cooking or relaxing and snacking. I had originally planned to go until Saturday morning, but I was so hungry that I decided I would stop on Friday.  

Waking up Friday morning, I found that I had no appetite at all. But I remembered how excited I was about thinking about eating the night before so I tried to get some breakfast. I had a spoon of peanutbutter, and almost threw up. The thought of putting food in my stomach suddenly seemed revolting. Later I had a bagel with butter and by lunch time I felt fine eating what I normally eat. 

One of the most interesting things about the whole experience was my last poop during the fast and my first poop after. Last one was like rabbit droppings. The first poop after I ate again was explosive. Maybe eating McDonalds that day was a bad idea.

I also read somewhere that your body is addicted to some of the chemicals you get every day from food, or maybe it's the happy chemical your brain gives you when you eat. I could definitely believe that. I think I felt kind of cold and shaky at times. I think if I did it again in a week or two it would probably go a lot better.

FastingandFurious	8	1	43	"So I have posted on here, under a different name before and tried a few fasts that were ""successful"" in their own right.   I have done two 7 day fasts, and one 10 day fast.....I am interested in trying to make it to at least 14 days this time.   

I have noticed that a lot of these threads start off with a lot of dialogue and activity, and then die off within the first week or so, which leads me to believe that most people are just unable to sustain extended fasts :(

I personally have found it hard because I go to school full time, AND I work in the restaurant business.  I live on campus at my school and either have to walk or ride my bicycle the 2 miles to work, and then am on my feet running around for 6-8 hour shifts....so while I have experienced a lot of benefits from the couple times I have fasted it has just been really hard to maintain the energy levels needed to do all the things I do.  

With that said,  I am going to try again starting in the morning...I have been feeling quite stressed lately and feel like a detox would do me some good....

EDIT:  Maybe I'm impatient but I think this subreddit really is dying :(  I haven't gotten any responses yet, but if I had posted anywhere else I am sure at least a few people would have chimed in by now....

EDIT 2:  It's 10:32 PM CMT here, and I decided to start tomorrow with most of you.  The previous night was almost completely sleepless for a lot of reason and I spend today feeling super crappy and drained, so I allowed myself a small healthy meal of fruits and veggies and a garden salad, loaded up on some healthy vitamins and supplements I had, and am about to get a great nights sleep and start tomorrow on a good foot.

Thanks again for those interested...why doesn't everyone list all their reasons for wanting to do it for a fast?   

I am personally doing it for a detox, to reset my body, mental clarify, and to try to see if an extended water fast will be able to help my body fight off and get rid of some harmless, but annoying fatty cysts I have all over my body.  They are benign and harmless, but form for no reason, and their size and sensitivity seems to directly fluxuate with my eating habits and stress levels.  Based on my own research, I have reason to believe a long, dedicated water fast, combined with some meditation, stretching, and rest will help me get rid of these cysts, as I believe completely that they are a manifestation of stress in my body after years of excessive alcohol consumption and other various problems that stemmed from my personal battle with alcohol.  I also hope that it will help with stress and some depression issues fasting has seemed to alleviate in the past.

**TL;DR -  I'm doing a water fasting cleanse for physical, emotional, and spiritual reasons to try to heal my body, which I've mistreated over the years (I'm currently 29) and I'd like to hear everyone else's reasons for fasting, and their experiences with it.**

1329270234.0	pq15i	Thinking About Quitting a Water Fast and on Day 16.  Advice plz?	NeedYoHelp3222	9	1	23	"Redditors!

To start, I am 5'8"", was around 204 lbs 4 weeks ago, 41 inch waist, and had a BMI of 30 (according to the scale and about 33.9% body fat although I think it was really 27%; I'm sure the scale is not that accurate...who knows.

About four weeks ago, I started a keto diet, then went on a PSMF, and 16 days ago I went on a complete water fast. I'm now 175 pounds with BMI of 26.5, 37 inch waist, feeling good and I have taken pictures and can definitely see the difference!

I wanted to fast for 30 days since that's about the time it takes to clean out the body, but right now I'm thinking about food more and more but the thing is that I still have 1 roll of fat in my stomach (better than 2) so I know my body isn't in starvation mode yet.  I'm shooting to go to 160 lbs so when I start to eat healthy and gain some weight back from mucle glycogen, food in intestine, that I'll be around 165~170 lbs.

Should I persist? Am I at the right time to quit? I'm half-way done I suppose. What do you guys suggest? I guess I'll still be losing weight when I transition from water to fruit juice and eventually to light meals. Should I fast until I have a six pack or at least no more rolls on my stomach?

Starting today, I began my control week wherein I consume just enough calories to stabilize my weight. Then I will begin the water fast, going as long as necessary to achieve 12% bodyfat.
I am taking multiple supplements to meet my micronutrient needs and avoid ill health.
I am logging all of my results and procedures and will supply all charts and graphs once it is finished.

TL;DR I'm fasting until I lose most of my bodyfat. I am being careful in doing so.

Any thoughts, questions, etc.?

UPDATE: I am now on Day 2 of the fast. I did lose a pound or two last week (interesting side note: it's hard to eat so many calories when you're monitoring them very carefully). Currently at 204.6 lbs and 20.2% bodyfat.

* Do a 24, 48 and 72 hour fast on different, scheduled days and open an /r/iama thread on it.

* Do a cross post to /r/vegan and /r/fitness (this sometimes annoys which is why it hasn't been tried).

This is the first time I am water fasting. I have never gone past two days. Regardless, I made a resolute decision to water fast for 40 days for weight loss as well as health benefits. I recently just finished my 11th day and was on my 12th but was really starting to miss food.

It doesn't help that no one around me supports my decision, and my parents are always ordering food and trying to force it upon me especially my mom.

 Anyways, I couldnt sleep and kept getting cravings for pizza so I ate two bites. Just invalidated my fast. My question is, should I continue to fast the full 40 days or just stop here and break open my fast? And then try again next time for 20 days? It is mentally very tough to do.

Also, will 2 bites of pizza really impact my digestive system?

I'm on day three of my water-only fast. I went into it on a three day juice-fast, so I've been without solid food for about 6 days now. Everything's been fine, but yesterday (water fast day 2), I started getting bad leg pain down the back of my thighs and the front of my hips. It only goes away if I move. Today the pain seems to have moved to the back of my calves, and it's there to a lesser extent on the front and back of my thighs.

I googled a little bit and it seems I'm not the only one who has ever experienced this. Some people are saying it's gout, which scares me. I'm pretty sure I'm not drinking enough water--I have a hard enough time drinking water when I'm not fasting. I'd estimate I'm drinking about a half gallon a day. I'm taking vitamins and was taking fiber but have pretty much stopped because it's gross. My pee, also, (sorry if this is tmi) smells quite bad. A few times it's smelled like asparagus pee.

So, just wondering what you all thought. I'm pretty new at this, don't know if I should be very worried or not re:possible gout.

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone. I did talk to my doctor. He told me the pain is probably an electrolyte imbalance since I was taking vitamins but no sodium.

While very overweight I am very active so not too much was water weight as I had experienced in the past.  Back in December my A1C came out 5.2 and as long as I stay in the right direction food/exercise wise my diabetes battle is over with me victorious.  I am not on any meds as my blood pressure and all are normal.  I have completed a 7 day water fast back in March 2012 so I kinda knew what to expect.

The first 2 days were typically difficult however not too bad.  I did work out on day 2 as normally I work out 3-4 times a week.  Got really tired at the end of the workout and decided I had done enough and it was time to let my body catch back up with energy.

Days 3-5 were fairly typical, I took some vitamins on day 3.

Day 6 I started feeling really hungry again.  I was feeling bad both mentally and physically.  Urine was dark orange, tried to drink more water but by the end of the workday I decided to stop on the way home, get some V8(the low sodium veggie juice) and some food to break the fast.  

I am not sure what was different this time other than it seemed maybe I did not condition myself enough prior or something.  I think my liver must have been making too much bile or something to have caused such dark urine.  I made sure to drink plenty of water.  I did make sure to eat veggies the 2 days prior to beginning the fast.  

I feel fine now(2 days after) however I am itchy all over and still have orange urine so I am not sure my liver has returned to normality.  Overall I feel fine, not jaundiced that I can tell and if I did feel bad I would go see the doctor.

Starting weight: 178.8 lbs

Morning weight: 168

Evening weight: 167.6

Daily Activity:

* 8am - Woke up, drank coffee.
* 9:30am - Worked with high school orchestra students. Felt a little tired.
* 11:30am - Lunch with my husband. Had some cravings around his food. Remedied it with more water. Took some ibuprofen for a slight headache.
* 1pm - 6pm Worked on my home business stuff. This is usually a time I snack, so I had some hunger. I had a chicken bouillon cube in hot water to combat it.
* 8pm - Friends came over for beer and cards. I had soda and water.

Overview: Mostly a good day. I had some hunger pangs for the first time. Still need to drink more water. My weight loss is slowing, but I take that as a good sign that most of my water weight is gone. 

Forecast: Tomorrow is preschool soccer again in the afternoon, but I get to sleep in, so perhaps I won't get the sleepy feeling in the afternoon. I have class in the evening for almost 3 hours. I usually grab some cheese or something small to tide me over, so I hope my hunger doesn't end up raging. I might grab a decaf coffee at night to prevent this."	t5_2s9dh	True

I'm on Fast-5 (19/5) since the beginning of 2012. I'm on a plateau since 3 months or so now.  
  
I went from no-diet, to low-carb, and I'm now on Keto and bodyweight-fitness with calories counting on MyFitnessPal.  
  
However I want to speed my weight loss and I'm thinking about adding 48h a week (I'm thinking about from sunday evening to tuesday evening) to my habitual 19/5 pattern.

I've been thinking to fast for quite some time now, but I think I'm finally ready! This will be my first fast ever and I'll try to make it to 24 hours. After that if everything is okay I'll resume my normal daily intake for 2 days and try 48 hours of fast. And if that is okay I'll continue to 72 hours after a little break and so on... At least that's the plan!


I lead semi-active life (doing some changes in that direction also), but I guess it's not enough to get rid off my 26 additional kg's. I hope I can get a pretty strong cleansing effect since I drink a lot of water/green and herbal tea.

Any suggestions?  For reference, I drink about 24 oz of coffee with Splenda in the morning before my workout, and then another 24 oz of coffee with Splenda throughout the remainder of my morning.  I might grab another coffee at school or work.

I've been doing IF, first informally as part and parcel of a summer diet, and more recently as part of an LG-style diet, for five months. It's very natural for me to not eat breakfast since I like to sleep and don't particularly like breakfast food. I'm on a college meal plan with very good, nutritious lunch food but the breakfast is kinda lousy.

Recently I've been worried that after my very harsh diet (I lost 30 pounds in three months) I might have developed a calorie restriction disorder. I've become rather obsessive about calories to the detriment of my personal life (since I feel the need to budget and plan everything, I get uncomfortable about having a night out with friends), and more generally to the detriment of my weight loss because trying to budget calories has created a lot of stress.

I love food and I want to enjoy it, but I also want to stay thin, so I was intrigued when I saw this article today on r/leangains: http://anthonymychal.com/2012/05/the-diet-to-end-all-diets-muscle-building-fat-loss-and-easy-living-without-the-calculator-or-scale/

I'm interested in trying out the meal skipping he suggests because it means I would have a more or less consistent level of caloric consumption on other days. This, for me, has been the biggest problem - cycling calories between workout and rest days. It means that on workout days I'm worried I'm eating too much, and on rest days I'm hungry and want to eat more, but need to maintain the deficit. I'm planning on eating ~90% TDEE to 100% TDEE on the other six days so as to maintain a decent, but not extreme deficit.

Can I get some feedback from those with experience about the effectiveness of this plan, especially in the long term? I think it looks like a lower-stress alternative to what I'm doing now."	t5_2s9dh	True

i dont recommend doing one while working, its just not working, its best if you are able to rest as much as you need whenever you need. i probably wont do another one while working unless i get sick. 

learned some new things about breaking a fast, its ok to do it with meat, fish, eggs, you'll get real full real fast. 

although i didnt break the fast very smartly and generally overate because i just missed food so much. burned my mouth with pizza on the first day for example :) . i wanted to start slow so took some coconut oil and it almost made me throw up for some reason, anyway, i dont think its that important to start that slow anymore, just eat and then relax, when you get the desire to eat do it again, but not before you feel the previous food is all digested up. just dont spike your blood sugar too much with carbs.

1346095177.0	yx2cw	On IF scheduling, training and meals	maloik	5	0	2	"Hi reddit

I've only recently first read about IF, not sure how or where exactly I came from but I ended up here. I did a bit of reading, but still some serious gaps so I just decided to ask you guys...

Regarding the 'schedule': I work from roughly 9-5, and realistically speaking any sport session will be after that (somewhere between 6 and 8pm). Between noon and 1pm we eat lunch at work, usually bread and some cheese, meat, 'salads' as we call it here (as in, chicken curry salad, ground beef, ... ). That means going really low-carb is pretty hard (or at the very least inconvenient) for me.
Breakfast I could skip if eating right before and then some time after my workout is more efficient.

As far as training goes, I have a hard time getting started if I'm alone. That means that currently, my best option is going swimming 2-3 times per week. In the near future I'll hopefully start rockclimbing again, and depending on whether or not I find a partner I might go to the gym once or twice a week. Might, perhaps, if, when...
In any case, the whole reason I'm doing all this is the upcoming winter season: I'm an avid skier, and I want to push my boundaries. Counting on 3 weeks out of bounds powder skiing, at least, and that means I'll need decent fitness and some more power in my legs and core.

Any tips for my situation are much appreciated, I'm sure those of you with a bit more experience in the mater can help me sort out a nice schedule.

1st: obligatory mod disclaimer: *fasting should be preceded by a visit w/a doctor to discuss personal physical state and is not necessarily meant for everyone at all times. People with eating issues should not partake. Always drink plenty of water and stop fasting at any signs of trouble &amp; seek medical attention.*

As we know, the body ensures survival by storing different types of fat in various locations and burns that fat during a fasting state. At breakfast (whenever that is), food intake is restarted, ideally in moderation. However, often fasting depletes the body, causing a baseline deficiency.

For me, this results in intense hunger, even after I have eaten my first meal (w/plenty of liquids) and waited 20. It's reminds me of a [Chinese finger lock](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/012/2/e/chinese_finger_lock_by_xxkitarahxx-d4m53tv.png).

I only get sick once or twice a year, and I've never really experimented with extended fasting (more than 16-18 hours) for recovery. Generally when I get sick, I try to eat as much vitamin rich food as I can stomach, but in retrospect, that only seems to do good in the short-term.

I suppose what I'm looking for here is anecdotal evidence. Have you tried fasting to help you bounce back from sickness? Did it have any effect, negative or positive? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**Update (in case anybody was curious!):** I did a 24 hour fast yesterday, seemed to help in the short term at least. I'm not completely healed today, but I do feel a little better! I'm going to fast again today to see if it helps more!"	t5_2s9dh	True

I used Smooth Move herbal laxative tea last night, as I read you should the night before you start. This morning, before I put anything in my body, I tried the Salt Water Flush ...twice.

I took an empty Gatorade bottle (32 fl oz), put one tbs of Morton brand Natural Sea Salt (yes the label says ""This salt does not supply Iodide, a necessary nutrient""), and filled it with warm water.

The first time I tried it, I chugged the whole thing. I let myself think it tasted like chicken broth, which helped with the taste. About 4 seconds after I chugged it, I puked it all up. Lots of yellow watery liquid.

The second time, I read that you can still sip it slowly over the course of about 10 minutes, so I tried to do that. I only got half way done with the solution until I was puking violently again.

1375462840.0	1jko6o	Any help appreciated.. please help me.. desperate	pleasehelpmepleaseee	7	4	4	"Hello.
I currently am in my 6th day… Getting tempted every day, but I lasted until now at least.
I have been a binge eater ever since I recovered from anorexia.
My normal body weight was 100lb for my whole life, until I went down to 70s when I became anorexic.
Now I go anywhere from 115-125 from constant binging/restricting.

Being sick of this life style and constantly worrying about my weight, I decided to start fasting a week ago.
After a day of trying to eat clean, I started my water fast.
Although I got tempted every now and then, I have been able to hold up until now.

Now the problem is, I am so scared that I will binge when I break my fast.
My original intention was to fast for about 20 days, then move on to eating healthy from then on.

I know that I will be able to eat healthy, since I will be happy with myself.
But I am still scared that I will binge every day.
Every day is a constant battle with an inner voice in me.
I do not know what to do… What should I do?

I currently have lost 10 lbs from 122lb. I was 112 last night.
If I eat though, I know that I will shoot up to 120lb, which will make me binge.
I have noticed as long as I am below 115lb, I am pretty happy with myself and do not binge.

Now my question is, can people keep their weight off after water fast for about a week or so?
I promise myself and to God, if he helps me keep this weight off I will eat healthy and take care of my body..
Do you guys think I will be able to keep the weight that I have lost..?
Or do you think I should keep on fasting (with a risk of binging every single day) for about 2 weeks?

I don’t know if this makes sense.. I just feel desperate… 
What should I do?

I woke up an hour early, drenched in sweat, burning up, and shaking. I had the worst stomachache ever and I felt as if I needed to puke. I tried standing up so I could head over to the bathroom but as I got out of bed I felt so weak I sort of just stumbled onto the floor. I got up and my head was spinning. I couldn't really walk on my own and needed to hold onto the wall as I made my way to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and I was pale.. like, really pale. I made my way to the toilet and started puking up this really acidic stuff. At this point I was terrified, and while still walking by holding onto the wall I made my way to the kitchen and ended my fast. I know around day 3 you are supposed to feel kind of bad, but is it really supposed to get that bad? I have been wanting to do another prolonged fast, but just want to know what happened here first. If it's something that isn't dangerous and that passes I will happily just work through it, at the time I just had no idea that was supposed to happen and it scared me.	t5_2s9dh	True

Essentially I fast 16 hours one day and try to go 20-24 the next. Nothing is written in stone except meeting a minimum of 15 hours in the fasted state everyday - typically from my dinner time to lunch the next day.

I'm not following any feeding routine counting macros and calories and all that. Just eating real homemade food. So my question is this - for the past few days, on my 20 hr fast days, I break my fast with a beer or two and it's awesome! Apparently monks also used beer while fasting during the middle ages so there is some precedent to it too.... (like I needed a reason hehe)


I like the concept of using liquids to break a fast because it goes through my system fast and doesn't take up room from the eventual meal, but for obvious reasons I don't want to keep drinking beer all the time. I wanted to ask and see what liquids if any you guys use to break a fast? 

Sugary juices are usually not my forte. The best idea I've had so far is non-alcoholic beer. (trying to keep it in the general category of 'convenient'; cooking another item like soup just to break a fast seems like more work)

In any case I would like to tell you what I do and for you to tell me if THEORETICALLY speaking everything is in the right track. I was 110 kg when I started and I'm 103.5 today, two weeks later.

**This is what I stopped doing:**

-Eating carbs and starches

-Eating sugar and milk

-Eating unhealty fats

-Having seconds

**This is what I started doing:**

-Eating less caloricaly dense food and/or less food overall.

-Eating more protein both animal and vegetal

-Fasting for 20 hours every day and eating 2 meals during my 4 hour period.

I know weight can vary by 5 pounds or more during the day, I weight myself daily but sometimes the scale surprises me by adding a couple of pounds or more. So it makes me wonder if I'm doing things correctly. When I fast I feel light, focused and great overall. Is it normal for my scale to act up on me like that? I weighted myself before and after going to the bathroom and turns out I had 2.5kg of ""extra weight "" on me. I did the same today and my weight stayed the same! XD

I estimate that I'm eating around 1000-1200 calories daily. My TDEE is at about 2500 calories per day. I also do light body-weight exercises at home, 3 times per week and go out walking for 60 minutes every week. 

For reference, here are a couple of pics or typical meals for me.

http://i.imgur.com/JoA8E9S.jpg[1]   That's 1 whole egg, assorted veggies and 4 tablespoons of beans.

http://i.imgur.com/aqjCmGs.jpg[2]   That's 1 and 1/2 palm size serving of fish, assorted veggies, and 4 tablespoons of beans.

I'm not a genius on the subject but I feel that what I'm doing should be enough to trigger a significant weight loss, regardless of what my scale may say from time to time. So I guess what I'm meaning to ask is: Is it normal for my scale to flip out every now and then? I know I should be losing weight but the scale just throws me off balance when it does that.

I just started this and I would like your input on the subject.

TMI Sorry Last night was so bad for me I woke up almost every 10 minutes because I was so gassy and needed to use the restroom. I was not even sure I woud be able to make it to work today as I do tech support on chats all day and was worried about the bathroom.

Well here we are 8:31pm and it appears that I have gone a full day with fasting so I decided to see how far along I can go. I read up on the benefits of fasting today and am setting a small goal of 5 days. I am not sure if I will be able to go that long but I will take it one day at a time. 

Here are a few of my questions. I am sorry if they have been answered before. I am kindda cranky atm due to lack of sleep and I want to make sure I go about this right. 

1. Is it ok for me to even drink teas while I am fasting? If so are black tea ok or should I really stick to green teas. I only drink real tea from tea leaves so is it ok to use some fruity one as well? I do not like sweeteners so I will be staying away from those but what about lemon wedges are they ok in there?
2. I normally take a multi vitamin daily to make sure I get all my nutrients is it ok to continue with this?
3. How safe will it be for me to go full keto once I decide to be done with this fast?
4. I am feeling somewhat of a fait headache so I will be going to bed but is it ok to take Ibuprofen if it gets to be too much?
Thanks for your input it is much appreciated.

On one hand I feel like it's okay because I'm not eating anything and it would supply at least a little bit of nourishment (specifically sodium) but on the other hand it *does* contain about 10 Calories per cup.

This will be my first long-term fast. I know the risks, I have done tons of research online about it, and I have enough body fat and nutrient reserves to sustain me for the entire fast. 

The only problem is that I have been getting twice a week allergy shots for the past few months. I am allergic to cats, dogs, rabbit, dust mites, and molds. I have two cats and even though they cause allergy symptoms which are sometimes unbearable (especially before I started the allergy shots), the happiness they bring me is more valuable to me than the benefit I would get from being away from the allergens. The reason I say this is because I know that some people will try to convince me to get rid of my cats and that is absolutely not an option for me. 

My question is: can I continue to receive my allergy shots twice a week while doing the fast? I don't want to ask my allergist because most doctors are scared of water fasting and will advise against it. It is such a taboo in our society. If I stop the allergy shots, it will put me behind in the progress I have made since the doses of allergens they inject increase little by little.

I want to use this time to get used to fasting and hopefully incorporate it into my life on a more regular basis (maybe do two 24 hour fasts a week, or alternate-day fasting). I also want to get my eating habits more under control. Another thing I'd like is to lose this last bit of weight.

Any advice?

I am doing this mainly for health reasons, but decreasing my body fat percentage and increasing muscle mass on a keto IF refeime is the goal for 2013. I might have been slightly pre-daibetic in the past so this factors into the motivation also, but there are many factors which generally boil down to a belief that IF and ketogenic diets are a healthy lifestyle choice.

I know I need to be careful when breaking my fast on friday. I have heard orange-juice and other fruits are good ways to break a fast, but I would like to remain in ketosis afterwards also.

Can i just break the fast on a regular ketogenic diet if i keep the initial portions very small? I am thinking two very small meals on the first day, and then on the next day just eat normal size meals.

Facts about my fast:

* I was/am getting over a minor cold.
* I lifted weights at medium effort, 2 hours into the fast.
* I got a great night of sleep.
* I donated blood plasma 12 hours into the fast.
* I did not drink any coffee (I usually drink 32 oz. every morning), but instead drank 5-6 cups of green tea.
* I drank ~1 gallon of water during the day.

So yesterday was the big day. No breakfast, no lunch, workout session, and then a huge post workout meal.

How did it go? Surprisingly well in fact. As it as been said everywhere, hunger tend to disappear after a while. But I had to drink a lot to get it under control. I drank coffee, tea and light soda, for the sugary taste.

I ate cottage cheese and a fistful of nuts before workout. Did a body attack session + weight training. I was worried about hypoglycemia to be frank. But I didn't encounter the slightest warning sign of it. Of course the weight training, and to a lesser extent cardio session, weren't the better I ever had. You can't expect to deplete your glycogen stores and then do you personal best. But I didn't refrain myself and gave all I had.

After that I ate a post workout meal, with tuna, tomatoes, eggs, veggies. I almost had to force myself to eat as I wasn't really hungry. The worst part? Forcing myself to drink a protein shake before going to bed.
And today? Back to fasting, but no workout tonight. So no binging either.

Is fasting difficult? Not really, except for the breakfast. Preparing breakfast for the kids while only drinking tea is quite difficult.
Is fasting effective? At least it's a good way to diminish the calories eaten in a day. I keep on going for a few days, recording my weight and body fat, as well as my weight training sessions and I'll see.

26 year old Male

5'10 215lbs (Heaviest was 234lbs when I started the warrior diet)

I am just stuck at 215. I cannot stand counting calories and I think that is why I am stuck right now. I am considering going back on the warrior diet to shed the last 15 lbs. I am a pretty built guy with thick legs and broad shoulders. I do have a spare tire I am trying to get rid of by July 12th for a beach trip.

I was in the gym before work but had recently quit when I got a new job that demands so much and on call rotation. I have a wife and a kid and totally exhausted when I get home from work. 

I haven't really done a water fast before but I was very accustome to the warrior diet because that is how I mainly ate while in the Marine Corps. It was just too hot while deployed to Iraq to eat during the day. I didn't realize it but that is basically the warrior diet.

I've finally found a way of fasting that works well for me.  I need advice on it!  I've been fasting and have had three cups of coffee so this might be a little run on or make less sense than it typically would, lol.

After almost two years of low carb diet, I discovered fasting, which is awesome.  I was doing intermittent fasting, and I loved it.  I started eating lots of carbs and basically went back to eating carbs all of the time.  I went back to low carb, and running twice a day, and now am getting back into fasting.  My dilemma is that I LOVE running, I feel crazy good and have so much more productivity when I do; however, I love fasting.  I feel really powerful and amazing when I fast.  I mean medium length fasts, like 3-4 days, too long to be considered intermittent and too long to run as much as I would like (I typically go between 30 and 40 minutes of hilly terrain, and when I do long fasts that's not an option for me).  

I still have about 35 lbs I would like to lose, maybe just 30.  I've never been below 149 so I'm not sure.  

So I know it's taken me a while to get to the point - I've recently started eating whatever I wanted in about a 2 hour span, and then fasting for 2-4 days and repeat.  It's not conducive to running, but it makes me feel awesome and I still get to eat whatever I want.  My body looks good when I do it, and I feel light, and not too full when I actually do eat, even though I'm eating between 1800 and 2400 calories at once.  However, I still love running and wonder if I can run the same days I eat?
My ultimate goal is to lose weight, but I want to achieve tone and firmness accompanied with exercise (not limited to running, I also enjoy strength training).  What is the best way to tackle this?   I apologize if this makes little sense - I am drinking too much coffee."	t5_2s9dh	True

1359227781.0	17bsok	Coffee and Cream Fast? 	wordplay86	4	1	13	"I have been intermittently fasting for many months now. Generally I do 16-18 hours fasted with a 8-6 hour eating window.

From what I understand and have read on Lean Gains and other websites is that what makes a fasted state a ""fasted state"" is the low baseline levels of insulin. Is that correct?

Today I'm beginning a 24 hour fast. I have done this two or three other times. This time however, I had a thought. I ate my two meals with in a 4 hour window, just finishing around quarter of two p.m. (we'll call it two) and I won't eat again until after two p.m. tomorrow.

However, this time I will be having two to six cups of coffee over the next 24 hours. No sugar, but with 1 oz of heavy cream per cup. I've calculated the calories for the cream and am still in a caloric deficit (though close to maintenance).

My theory here is that the servings of cream in a delicious cup of coffee dispersed over this 24 hour period will help keep me from getting hungry or feeling deprived.

Now because heavy cream is almost entirely water and fat, with an insignificant amount of sugars and because I know that dietary fat by itself has no insulin response....

Would I remain in a fasted state for the majority of that time? Does anyone know of any research of fasting with small amounts of fat?

With no insulin response (and I'm assuming fat also has no blood-glucose response) I would imagine that although my body might be using this fat for energy shortly after eating, that it would return to using body fat and ketones shortly thereafter.

(BTW I have been in nutritional ketosis for over three weeks now, and probably becoming quite well fat-adapted)

Thoughts? Comments? Research?

Mind you I have had insomnia since I was very young. 

So I meant to fast 24 hours and I did just that(though I'd meant to break my fast at 8am the next day totalling 30 hours)-but I broke it at 3am waking up (or perhaps I didn't even sleep, it was bad). I hadn't eaten since saturday night/sunday morning (2am at the latest).

All of sunday after waking around 1030am I only drank plain coffee and tea. It was tolerable until around 6pm, where I just upped my water intake. I went to bed around 11pm and took two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with water since I was having hunger pangs. I had also had two TEAspoons with water earlier in the day.

I couldn't sleep. I may have slipped under but for the most part I was day dreaming and staring at my wall for a few hours. I think I finally slept around 2am, but by 3am I awoke to a weird sensation. I felt like time had slowed down. My left arm also felt achy and a bit numb. 

I attributed that to sleeping on it wrong, but the last time I felt like I was moving in slow motion was when I took too much allergy medication, and it was almost the same disconnected feeling. It made me feel woozy and scared.

 I ate a clif bar because I figured maybe the vinegar was keeping my blood sugar too low after already fasting? I ended up eating other food too because I became hungry, and the feeling slowly went away. I probably went back to sleep around 6. ...help?"	t5_2s9dh	True

I've been reading about breaking fasts in order to keep the weight off (though I understand water weight will come back and that it's inevitable). Most of what I've been reading says to break the fast with diluted juice for a few days (I'd make my own at home), moving on to regular juice, then incorporating raw fruits and vegetables and maybe yogurt or broths, and to ween yourself off the fast for as long as you fasted.

I tend to stay away, in general, from sugars, grains, complex carbs and processed foods.

**Age:** 28


**Height:** 6'3""


**Weight:** about 230lbs


**~~BMI~~ BF%:** 29% (I know... I know)


My Goals are to lock in an overall weight of about 205Lbs with a BMI under 20%


I currently am in the gym three days a week, but have only started working on ironing out my form and the stuff that scares me like squats and those things like pull ups. Time spent in the gym has done wonders for my confidence and overall feeling of wellness. 


I also take a variety of sups to make up for various deficiency. I love thermogenics, and taking D3 has helped with my belly fat. I do well while on thermogenics as I have an office job that tends to be rather sedentary. 


For my IF I'm doing a basic 16/8 regimen. I can start eating at 1pm and my window closes at 9pm.



I tend to be a night owl, but have been trying to pick up better sleeping habits. I try to be in bed by 11:30pm but honestly it's usually more like 12 or 1:30 if I'm lucky ( and reddit is dead ;))



As for my nutrition I'm trying to stay under 2000 calories a day for weight lose purposes.  My first feeding at 1, which happens to be my hour, I eat a lean turkey burger patty on a nature own sandwich thin (which I call sadbread) with half a tsp of ketchup. I will usually have a can of diet coke at this time too.  About two hours later I will consume a Gala apple.  At 5 on my way out the door I eat a Pure  Protein Bar and head to the gym. I generally work out from about 5:30 to 7:30; I come home have a Go-gurt and wait for my wife to get off of work so we can have dinner together. For me dinner is a lean chicken breast and some peas (or something like that) w/ a diet coke as a beverage.  That's the basic framework for my current diet.



Is anything sticking out as glaringly poor about how I am conducting this? Any constructive feedback would help me out. I seem to recall reading that IF is best used if your BMI is already much lower than mine, but I figured it could still be helpful.

This has nothing to do w/religion, the ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to fast or doubting someone's motives. It's why, as a group, does this happen?

My hypothesis is:
Discipline + 1 or 2 Dates = Normal Fasting

Now remove discipline and add fat &amp; sugar + time and you have a scenario similar to the one we are in. Does this have a large effect on a single meal? Almost certainly not. But over the course of many meals and generations, yes, it would make a habit of preparing larger meals, etc., which may be a possible cause for the weight gain.

Fasting creates a kind of [Chinese finger trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_finger_trap#Cultural_influence) for most people, that is, they want to kill the hunger so bad, they quickly consume 120%+ of their ""normal"" pre-fast calories and the body obliges by storing the depleted calories more efficiently via accessibly body fat."	t5_2s9dh	True

 -Fasting 1 day in 3 

 -Wendler 5/3/1 compressed from 1 session a day for 4 days to 2 sessions a day in 2 days

 -Starting a reasonably intense yoga class

The day after fasting I train with Wendler and eat good amount of protein. The day after that, more protein.

Today is my first day of fasting and I'm about to go to sleep. I'm loving it, but I have been thinking about food a lot(which is alright I guess). I went to an amazing yoga class, had a couple cups of tea before that and a double espresso afterwards.

Been lurking for a while and generally it seems all my questions are asked (and answered by other people). 

I am trying the alternate day fasting approach i.e.

Monday Wednesday Friday and Sunday I eat 500 to 600 calories in the space of 4 hours usually in the evening
The remaining days I fast for 16 hour and count my calories but generally wind up between 1800 to 2000 calories on those day.

This approach has been working great till now and I am down 7 Kgs and more than 4 inches off my waist in 38 days.

I have tried a low carb high protein diet in the past and have managed to lose a significant amount of weight but i had to quit that on account of a severe gout problem. 

Now I have a sharp pain in my foot and I am assuming it is gout. I am trying to eat healthy and don't have any meat on the fasting days. I also have a lot of water ( between 7 - 8 litres ) daily. I have just started having a lot of green tea as well. Anything else I should be doing to help the gout pain.

Also I have having sleep issues i.e. I am sleeping 10 hours plus daily and cant seem to wake up in the morning and am exhausted daily.

Should I try a water fast instead?

About a month ago, I fasted for 8 days (I've fasted for 4 days around five times before and didn't have any negative experiences afterwards). It might not be that long, but apparently it was long enough for my body to make some noticeable changes.   
   
I broke my water fast on the ninth day with watermelon, and one single little bite make my stomach swell like a huge balloon, which was very weird, and basically stayed like that for at least two weeks. It wasn't really painful, just being super bloated despite eating very little food, and also being constipated. Before my fast, I had a flat stomach all the time, now I have a visible roll of fat there. This is strange, because I never had that kind of stomach fat before, and it bothers me very much and I'm actually downright worried if it never goes away, if fasting for 8 days caused some long-term damage, but I'll just have to wait and see.

I don't think or hope so, but I can say that I regret fasting and won't be doing it again because of this. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but just 8 days of fasting has made me fatter than I've ever been in my entire life! And yes, I did it for weight loss, and I know a lot of you do it for the same reason.   
  
TL;DR 8 days of fasting about 4 weeks ago has left me with a roll of stomach fat I've never had before as the only result of the fast "	t5_2s9dh	True

However, after failing to keep up with that time and again, about three weeks ago I just stopped eating one day. I went probably 36-48 hours before finally eating something. It was not* planned - I just got pissed off at my lack of self-control.

Since then, I have kept up with the exact same routine: no eating until 5pm every day, and at that point I just eat an incredibly large (healthy) meal. I do eat a bit of bread, but my wife makes our bread from scratch with whole wheat. I also eat occassionally a potatoe or some other simple starch. For the most part, though, it's just been meat and vegetables and fats and other healthy food.

It wasn't until just a few days ago that I started reading about fasting. I knew nothing about IF. I didn't know what I'm doing was an actual thing. I was just trying to get healthier, and this seemed to work.

As someone with hypoglycemia, I also have to say that I feel phenomenal. I've never gone so long without getting kind of shakey or feeling angry at being hungry (the anger issues of a hungry, carb deprived hypoglycemic individual can be scary).

I have read, however, conflicting reports on how healthy this way of life is (long-term) for someone with hypoglycemia.

**So for those who have studied this much more than I have, can you give any advice, warnings, or thoughts on the long-term effects of intermittent fasting?**


I'm seriously considering never giving this up at this point. The mild hunger pains don't even begin to compare with how amazing I feel.

A nice side effect is that I've gone from 200lbs. to about 188lbs. in three weeks. At least 4-5bls. were lost within the first couple days, though, and I'm pretty sure that was water weight.

My weight loss should be more controlled at this point, too, as I've increased my calorie intake at dinner time. Even so, I'm definitely still shedding pounds at an alarming rate.

Anyway, all of that is great, but I don't want to seriously mess up my system long-term. Diabetes is a real concern of mine. Should I be worried?

**tl;dr - I have read conflicting reports on how healthy long-term intermittent fasting is for someone with hypoglycemia. So for those who have studied this much more than I have, can you give any advice, warnings, or thoughts on the long-term effects of intermittent fasting?**

1304899849.0	h6xvo	Is fasting for 7 days (daily multivitamin and water only) advisable for a type 2 diabetic?		2	1	6	"A bit of background here - I'm rather overweight, and as a result have type 2 diabetes now.  I want to lose weight, but I'm not very good at controlling my portion sizes when I eat regularly.  So, I have this idea, if I fast for seven days, perhaps my stomach will shrink somewhat and I won't have the urge/ability to stuff so much in.   

Additionally, I've noticed that when I consume a very low carbohydrate diet, my blood sugar levels are stable.  I am interested in monitoring them during this period of seven days (Monday to Monday) to see how they are, and if my need for medication can be reduced purely by diet.  (Assuming, of course, my physician gives me the OK after I'm done and my sugars remain stable on a very low carb diet).

I'm mostly just wondering if anyone knows of any major issues I might run in to I should watch out for,

I've been reading a lot about fasting recently, and have decided to give it a try. When I think back, I can't remember ever having gone 24 hours without food, or even missing a couple of meals, which can't be healthy. I'm going to have dinner today, and not eat until dinner tomorrow. Depending on how I feel during dinner time tomorrow, I might even try to go for the 36 hour mark, but I'm not gonna push too hard since it's my first rodeo to speak.

I picked tonight / tomorrow since it's Ekadashi for Hindus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekadashi); I'm not that religious, but I always remember as a kid my grandparents fasting on that day which comes twice a month, so I figured I might as well do it on a day that has some fasting precedent in tradition.

My main question - is 24 hours enough to get some of the benefits of fasting? I don't want to push too hard on my first go around, but I don't want it to be a complete waste of time either. "	t5_2s9dh	True

I have started unsuccessfully about 10 times in the past month and a half.  I was doing intermittent fasting easily and maintaining my weight after about a year of ketogenic eating (down 50 lbs, yay!).  I went a little crazy with the fasting and starting eating lots of bread and sugar again, and then went from only eating it during my window to eating it all of the time, and now for the past three days I've been in a low carb diet again, but not really ketogenic.  Probably around 50-70 g a day.  I originally had dropped from 212 to 161.8, but since the holidays/my experimenting with fasting, I've been averaging around 175 and it's definitely not optimal - I still have about 30 lbs to go.  I'm 5'6 and female.

Anyway, to wrap it all up, I want to post this to motivate myself?  I see some people update their fasting log frequently, and they seem to be more successful.  Tomorrow I have a day of festivities, which will include drinking and eating, and it has been rescheduled/planned for a while.  I'm going to keep a low carb diet, and only drink zero carb alcohol.  I'm going to start the day after that (hopefully there is minimal/no hangover!).  The reason for the odd number of days: I have a family get together March 31st, and there will be lots of food and offense taken if I do not eat anything.

Ok, so here goes!

3/11 - 175
I will start fasting 3/14, and break my fast 3/31.

At this point, I REALLY need to stick to something.  I think this is a great idea.  Any suggestions, anything, would love to hear them!  Or any similar experiences.  Or if anyone wants to do it with me!

Thanks very much!!


---------------------------
**Day 1:** Really difficult.  I haven't been doing any form of fasting for at least 2 weeks and I always break my fast this way within 12 hours, by having this ridiculous inner dialogue about how I'll still lose weight and be fine if I just eat ketogenic.  27 hours at this point, feeling insane and really mean.  The longest I've done was 41 hours, and I'm determined to complete at least four days (as that seems to be when most people start feeling better).  Overall I want to say I'm determined to get to 17 days but it's feeling a little crazy!

**Day 2:** A little better today, I'm currently at 40.5 hours, thirty minutes away from my longest fast.  My mood has definitely improved, I've actually been very productive and only slightly irritable.  I've been having a lot of coffee and water, and I know that it's advised against but I have a lot of 0 calorie/sugar drinks.  Trying to have them as a last resort!  I wanted to note about the coffee, and perhaps this is common sense - when I have my usual coffee, heavy cream, and Splenda, I feel exhausted almost immediately after consuming.  Just having coffee and a bit of Splenda is affecting me the way I think it's supposed to?  Feeling energetic afterwards.  I also had one piece of sugar free gum, assuming the rule that under 5 calories an hour is still technically fasting. (or was it 10 calories? 13?).  That was a huge mistake!  What I'm reading says that will initiate your digestive processes.  My stomach just growled for about 30 seconds straight, I started counting after I noticed it was still going.  haha. I also noticed I've been grinding my teeth since about 12 hours in?  I don't realize I'm doing it most of the time - has anyone else had this issue?  I did fall asleep at 12 last night as opposed to the usual 2-3.  I'm confident I can make it to tomorrow morning, and almost positive I can fast beyond then.  I'm really excited to reach 48 hours for the first time!

On a non workout day, I try to center my feeding times: 12-4-8, and some coffee in the morning. It went okay, save for a few hunger pangs before noon, I had a good 8-hour window, and I could have dinner and go out without much hurrying.

Now, however, I come home late, and by the time I make lunch it's 6, and to eat in time for 8-hours, I have to do 1-6-9, which is problematic in almost every aspect: The morning just takes too long, especially with me now having to travel on foot, focus on work etc. I get easily distracted and hungry. Then there's the huge gap till lunch which makes me distracted again as the workday ends, and then dinner being a little too close and me not being hungry, and interfering with me going out.

So I was thinking of moving it to 8.30-12.30-6 which does fuck up the 8-hour window, but it seems a lot more convenient, although I would probably get hungry by night time.

I've done this cleanse before. While I understand that it is not primarily a mechanism for losing weight, it is a great jump-start.

The last time I did this cleanse, I lost 20 pounds in 10 days. I gained about 5 back, and then continued to lose. 67 lbs total. I maintained that weight for about a year, then gained weight and muscle.

However, in recent months, I've gotten back to just shy of my personal high. I weighed in at 243.2 lbs earlier today. I am a fairly muscular man and 6'1, but my ideal weight is probably around 200-210. So I hope to lose 30-40 lbs.

I eagerly await this 10 day fast. Watching the weight come off my body, feeling my body detox...I can't wait. And after I see the weight I have lost, I will think twice about eating unhealthily when the cleanse is up.

I really feel unhealthy and I'm always worn out. I'm thinking about doing the master cleanse (lemonade fast) and then transition out of that to a full vegan diet. 

I was wondering if you would please share your recipe for mixing and tell me what I can expect. Im going to go on a 10 day fast, is that too much or too little in terms of time?

Right now I'm 350lbs and I think this will help kick start my long journey to lose weight. 

Any advice?

*But even that study had a question mark hanging over it. Its authors had disregarded about half of the deaths among the monkeys they studied, saying they were not related to aging. If they had included all of the deaths, there was no extension of life span in the Wisconsin study, either.*

*While the data pretty much rule out any notion that the low-calorie diet will increase average life spans, there still is a chance that the study might find that the diet increases the animals’ maximum life span, she said.* 

*The University of Wisconsin’s control monkeys were allowed to eat as much as they wanted and were fatter than those in the aging institute’s study, which were fed in amounts that were considered enough to maintain a healthy weight but were not unlimited.*

I'm not sold one way or the other right now.  I'm not lowering my daily calories below 1900 (or letting them go too high), but it seems that simply setting a limit at all has the same results as setting a low limit."	t5_2s9dh	True
