I realise this post will get lost in the ocean that is Reddit, but for anyone who does happen to come across it, I sincerely hope this is of some benefit to you.
I just wanted to leave you guys with a collection of some of the most useful resources I’ve come across on reddit over the past year or two.

I’ve recently had some minor success in releasing my own single, and without sounding cliché, if I hadn’t joined the reddit community I seriously would never have come close to doing it.  So for that reason I’d like to give back to the community in what small way I can.

The following links don’t only pertain to technical knowledge and concepts, but instead also tackle some of what I believe to be more important issues such as mindset and attitude - whether music  related or not.

I’ve never been a proper member of Reddit and so most of my links are bookmarked external links, but where possible I’ll include the original Reddit post.

On a different level, two other things which have helped me immensely just in terms of daily life and mental attitude, are :

-	“A New Earth” by Eckharte Tolle and;
-	 The Joe Rogan Experience Podcast. This might not be everyones cup of tea but I find it funny and insightful.

Cheers guys and happy creating.

----

Edit: PacSun has reached out to me and is reviewing a proposal. Thank you so much Reddit for all of your help! More info to come. Seems that the issue wasn't PacSun's fault as much as it was the production company's. 

-------

Hey Reddit, I've actually never posted on here, but a lot of people have suggested I bring my problem your way to see if anyone has some ideas.

My name is Waylon Thornton, I'm an independent musician. I've been playing and recording music since I was 13, and I'm now 25. It's always been a practice of mine to put my music online for free download or donation. I don't like holding my music hostage from people who want to hear it and financial gain is generally not a big concern of mine when it comes to music.
All of my music is licensed under Creative Commons as Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike, so if anyone wants to use it for a not-for-profit video or project, they're welcome to do so. However, if it's for any project which is commercial or promotional, my permission is required, and I typically ask a licensing fee. If someone is going to make money, with my music in tow, then I deserve a cut, right?

Recently it has come to my attention that PacSun has used one of my songs in a promotional video for their new Kendall &amp; Kylie Jenner line. The only issue is, they did not contact me for permission about this, and despite several attempts on my end to get in touch with someone, they have not replied to me, and seemingly won't.

Here's the offending video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfKJ55CCvus (currently down until a deal is reached.)

Notice that I'm credited in the information of the video, but not in the video itself. Also, when the video is viewed on the official PacSun website, there is no crediting information whatsoever to denote that the song is mine.

I'm not a sue happy person. I prefer to settle things through a discussion or phone call and be on my way. Even if I wanted to sue, I can't afford a lawyer.

I guess my question to you all is, what should I do?
Here's a link to the album from which the music was taken. I'm assuming it was picked up through the Vimeo Music Store, where the CC license is still readily available and noticeable. -- http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Waylon_Thornton/Mystery_Club/

Sorry if this is in the wrong place, like I said it's my first go around.
Thanks!

1362390467.0	19mqdv	a touring drummer's life in a nutshell. 	asphalt_wanderer	486	89	187	"I just wanted to write a short thing about my years on the road. This is to share in what fellow drummers have suffered and triumphed through, and to give an insight to what it's like for someone who's never toured with a band before. 


You're ready. The CD's been recorded. The 6 hours a day you spent perfecting every beat and rhythm to carry the pulse for the guitars. The sweat dripping down your face when you call it a day. The blood dripping from your blisters from your overworked fingers. Calloused up palms are inflamed and bright red. 

It's time now. You've spent the past four months working as many hours as you possibly could to pay the rent for the month and a half you'll be gone. For the gas to go in the van. For the van's insurance payment, and the last payment on the van itself. 

You try to get some shuteye, but all you can think about it how well tomorrow night will go. After hours of playing with your mind, you fall asleep. 

It isn't enough. 

You wake up much earlier than you wanted to and haul yourself for one last run through over the songs before you pack everything up and head to the van at the storage center. Your blisters have partially healed, thanks to the superglue you used to keep them shut. After a couple of hours, you're satisfied. Everything's to your liking. 

You spend the next hour breaking your kit down and making phone calls you need to make before you leave town. Mom, dad, sis, best friends, girlfriend, pastor, everyone. They all know the years of sacrifices you've made to get to this point. The thousands of dollars you've invested, the sleep you've lost wondering if it's worth it, being there for your bandmates in the bad times, and rejoicing with them in the good times. The literal blood, sweat, and burning tears that have formed the foundation of your life. 

It's time. You drive out to the van, and your guys are all there. Vocalist, guitarists, bassist, merch guy, and you. Your best friends out of the 7.3 billion human beings on the planet. The ones that know you through and through, and know you better than you know yourself. Another two hours is spent checking inventory. Sticks, picks, strings, guitars, backup guitars, bass, backup bass, heads, electronics, cabs, drumheads, pedals, stands, every bit of it is checked off. Merch count is done. 

It's loaded up. The trailer's full after two semi-pulled backs and an overstretched ligament. But it's nothing ibuprofen can't fix. 

You're off. The bunks are occupied. Captain and copilot have the wheel for the next seven hours. You retire to your bunk built from a 3/4'ths single mattress and wood bought from home depot, and you settle in. 

Check your bag. Realize you forgot half the stuff you needed three hours later. Spend $40 at a Love's or Sheetz to make sure you don't offend the nasal passages of everyone else in the van. 

Luckily, you have your essentials. Macbook. Ipod. Phone. Debit Card. 80 gigs worth of pirated movies, tv shows, and games. Phone charger and macbook charger. IPOD charger. Isolation earbuds. And that nifty little curtain you installed around your bunk to keep the light out. 

You miss the town you just left. Familiar faces and good friends. You miss her. 

You drift off dreaming of your own bed, and a hot meal. 

You awaken hours later(it feels like 20 minutes) as you feel the big door slide open. You poke your head out for a second to see where you are. It's the venue. Time to load in. 

After a few more sore muscles, the gear is loaded in, and soundcheck is done. You're playing fifth tonight, which gives you a few more hours to doze off.

You happily retreat back to the bunk. You fall asleep for an hour and wake back up. The van isn't running, and the a/c isn't running. You're baking. It's dead summer too. 

You flip the electronics on for a second to roll down all the windows. The breeze flies through the van, cooling you in your damp tank top and shorts. 

This moment, this blissful moment when you're finally allowed to sleep well. It won't last. 

Your vocalist shakes you awake a couple hours later. It's time. 

You grab a fresh pair of sticks from your bag and walk inside. The crowd is big. Bigger than usual. They're chanting the band's name. The stage darkens are you all get ready. 

You settle on your throne, doing final stretches as the intro sample kicks in. 

Click click click click goes the click track in your ear. 

Here we go. 

It's 40 minutes of non stop movement and aggressive playing. You're going crazy, the crowd's going crazy, and your guys are going crazy. It's nuts. The kids know the new song, and you can hear them over your vocalist. 

Two weeks later, the process is still being repeated. You've watched all 80 gigs of the movies and tv shows you downloaded. The games have lost their allure. 

Sleep is scarce now, and your health is fading. The taco bell from yesterday made you puke at the truck stop. You stopped to look at yourself in the giant plate glass window. 

You hadn't showered for days. Your hair is matted and clingy, and seems to grow in patches. You can't afford the pay showers at Love's. You can barely afford to put in your share of the gas money, let alone feed yourself. You can't afford to eat healthily. Soda is cheaper than water, and two day old gas station burgers are 50 cents apiece. You have no choice if you want to have money when you get home. 

By this time, hygiene products and clothing are disappearing. Blame is shifted around the van, and it most of the time has just been misplaced or left at a venue. You spend more on keeping yourself presentable than keeping yourself fed. 

People are getting fed up with each other from time to time. It's cramped, and it's hot at night. You can't afford to bust the gas to let the van sit idle all night. You find a walmart parking lot, roll down the windows, and open the sliding door to let the breeze in. 

Some nights there's a breeze to lower the temp in the van to a respectable 70 degrees. Some nights there's not. 

Everyone smells now. BO and terrible food smells permeate the air in the van. Nothing can be done. Laundry hasn't been done, and no one has clean clothes at this point.

Some mornings you wake up, and you're caked in sweat and grime. You stumble out of bed and wander into the walmart with your laptop, intent on skyping people back home by piggybacking off of any unsecured wifi.  

It helps. Mom and Dad say hi and wish you well. So does sis. You're three hours behind them, and the sun is still coming up. Twilight outside, which casts a weird color inside the van. 

Three days later, you have a shower. The water is lukewarm, and it lasts for thirty seconds before the back door bursts open and you have to run. You didn't strip completely bare. 

Only this wasn't a shower. You used a hose behind a KFC to wash your hair and get the grime off your body. 

You didn't manage to get all the soap out of your hair. You take the hose behind the Hardee's to finish the job. 

You can't wait to be home and be clean. To have a hot shower, eat food that doesn't come from a drive thru or a chip bag or soda can, and to see her. 

The drives are long, and your straw gets pulled. A lot. The longest was seven hours for you. That one was bad. You almost ran off the road four times, and you had to replace a flat tire. No bueno. The drives are worse than having to endure the heat. 

Your body has deep aches. Your arms constantly feel like you just hit the weights for an hour straight. The blisters are extremely painful. The callouses are constantly red and tender. 

Kids have been telling you what a sick drummer you are, you've been taking it in stride. It humbles and honors you, and it makes you think about what a blessed life you lead. It makes it worth it. 

Fast forward to the last night of tour. You didn't sleep at all the previous night, and drive thirteen hours to play this one last show. The rest of the tour package went home, it's just you and local bands filled with your best friends. 

Your phone has been off for a week. The company screwed up the autopay system, and you've been out of contact with everyone. You're frustrated, and so is everyone else. But you've never been closer to your brothers, and you've never been happier. 

It's the hometown show for you. Mom, dad, sis, pastor, friends, family, and she is there. She smiles at you as you sit on your throne, ready to go. 

The intro kicks in, and it's 40 minutes of pouring sweat and high energy hardcore. 

It's done. The kids are cheering, and it's time to go home. You quickly pack up your kit and load it into the trailer. You grab your bags and throw them in your car, which Mom drove up for you to take back to your apartment(which you share with the rest of the band).  

Mom and Dad hug you and tell you they're proud of you. You weep openly at their acceptance and cognizance of the work you've put in. 

Friends hug you and pat you on the back and welcome you home. You politely decline requests to go out to eat. 

You secretly hope you never eat anything unhealthy again. 

You reek of BO and sweat. 

The van takes off and take the trailer back to the storage unit, where the van will also stay. 

You pile into your car and throw your bag on the passenger seat. You take in the solitude and sink your head into the seat for a moment, inhaling deeply. 

You made it. 

The drive home seems so short compared to what you just went through. 

You've got the apartment to yourself. Everyone else is with family or girlfriends. 

You'll see her tomorrow. She's got school and went home after you reconciled at the show. 

Shower time. You strip down and throw your incredibly dirty, smelly clothing into the laundry bin. 

You sit in the shower til the water turns ice cold, and then some. The dirt just came off in waves. Your hair turned a lighter color after it was done. 

You notice the six pounds the tour diet added to you in the mirror. 

You throw on the clean pair of clothes Mom and Dad gave you, and you dive onto your mattress. Literally. 

You're out in a matter of moments. 

Two things cross your mind before you close your eyes.

You have to be at work at noon tomorrow. 

And you can't wait to be back on the road again. 


It's that set time. It's what you live for. What you dream about. 

When you can do you what you were born to do for this phase in life. When the world melts away and five people become one cohesive, creative instrument. When the heart takes over, and the mind takes a backseat. Violent passion surfaces, and you're home."	t5_2qmah	True

He has a bright mind and a lot of quirks autistic by nature, such as getting very easily upset with things, not liking loud noises and music. He does appreciate certain kinds music, mostly classical, sometimes jazz, but rarely electronica. But he always either turns the music down so much that nobody else can enjoy it anymore, or more often simply turns it off.

So I put on Daft Punk's Random Access Memories in the car the other day at the lowest volume so as not to irritate him. He didn't protest it at first. Few days later, we are in the car again, he puts the Daft Punk CD into the player himself, and...

Turns the volume up! To a level that I would listen at, but only when nobody's around :) We enjoyed listening the whole album to the last bit, and it was QUITE LOUD. That was a breakthrough of a kind.

While looking for explanations, I came across this interview with Giorgio Moroder that sheds a little light on who Daft Punk really are: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wj13ZB8ueUk#t=29s Which is, of course just the tip of the iceberg.

While R.A.M. is undoubtedly cool from the musical perspective, there seems to be something in there that not everyone can really appreciate. I suppose, little messages here and there that Thomas left for those perfectionist sound freaks like himself.

Anyway. Enjoy the music!"	t5_2qmah	True

* **Internal temps:** Processor core temp is around 32c idle, and 60c - 64c full load (Pro Tools, Guitar Rig). I designed the cooling system so that the warm air will blow between the fins of the heatsink, and over the top and bottom of the interface card. From there, the blower vacuums the warm air out of the side of the case. Under full load, the warm air blowing out is lukewarm, at best. I performed a 24-hour cooling test (with temp probes from my multi-meter) and the results were similar.
 
* **Interface wiring:** The Delta 1010lt comes with 8/8 analog I/O; all I did was convert the ends to an unbalanced XLR plug. In total, there are 6 unbalanced XLR inputs, and 2 balanced mic pre-amps. I can go into more detail about all the wiring, if someone is interested. Just send me a PM.

* **Cost:** All in all, parts for the cpu, interface, screen, wiring, various hardware, paint, solder, came to about $1500. It took me about 100 hours to build, over a 3 week period (I had a lot of free time)

I can't believe I didn't post pics:

1371715720.0	1gpsc0	Here's a 9-part tutorial series on Film Scoring	hennoxlane	401	57	37	"Hi,

Over the past year, I have created a nine part series about film scoring. Using Propellerheads Reason, I adress several techniques and tips for anyone who wants to start making some orchestral compositions. The series is generally aimed at producers or composers with a good basic knowledge of producing, but who want to up their game by adding in those amazing vibes a well thought out orchestral arrangement can bring to their music. 
 
 
Film scoring is obviously the first type of music that comes to mind, but I encourage you to use these techniques in just about any genre you are producing. Be it classical, dubstep, DnB, rock, pop or any other type of music you like.
 
Now of course, you don't necessarily *need* to own Reason to follow along. Practically everything I talk about is completely applicable to other software such as Logic or Ableton. I just happen to be an avid Reason user.
 
Bottom line is, I want to share this series with you guys, completely free of charge. You can watch the series on youtube, following the links below:

Basically, mixing is about fitting everything into the spectrum without interference. Too many overlapping voices and it just devolves down into a wall of mud. But just remember when you're struggling and all your material sounds horrible and it's all fucked-


""Beautiful things grow out of shit""- Brian Eno

(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1Cvs44i-Q&amp;t=35s)

But, you're going to need to tend to that plant for it to flourish.

* Start with the Instruments First

This means simple orchestration-if you have a bunch of tracks all in in the same octave, it's going to be impossible to keep them from stepping on one another.

* Patches First

Even if you don't do synth based music, this applies:if voices decay into one another, then it will inevitably be muddy. Similarly, it's always better to tweak the filters in your synth before you turn to EQ to get rid of brightness or unwanted body. It's always better to change the recording or the sound itself then to try to fix it downstream.

* Stack, Stack, Stack

A lot of times you need more then one layer to a sound. If you say, clap your hands, you'll hear 3 distinct sounds:an initial attack from the impact, the body where your hands resonate a small bit, and then the reverb tail from whatever room you are in. This isn't just true talking about synths, it's the foundation of pop music to stack vocals, you hear multiple rythym guitars in all kinds of stuff. Even coming from the same audio, using returns to have multiple FX chains on one voice is a vital part of your sonic repertoire.

* Levels

If you don't have a preliminary master done before you start mixing, then you're fighting a losing battle. To get everything to jive you're gonna need way too big of boosts and it's going to be colored horribly. On the same note, if the frequency response of your speakers or room is fucked, it's going to be impossible to mix.

Another part of this is compression. You don't want so much dynamic range that you can't hear the low amplitude stuff, but too much and you lose all the feeling of it. Don't have the threshold too low or the ratio too high, unless you're going for a really constant volume and aggressive sound. Don't have the attack so low you lose the attack or too long to where it's not cutting the transients enough, or the release too short that its abruptly changing or so long it's constant. Generally I also tweak the compressors after I'm onto mastering to get them just right.

Distortion falls into the range of compression, but it does color the sound so don't be too aggressive if you just want some warmth. Don't use overdrive unless you want a really up front, aggresive sound. Saturations nice especially if you use real magnetic tape, same thing with valve amps.

* Pan It!

Dial in the stereo field before you start with the EQ. It opens up everything so much. Bass should be panned center or very close in most cases, but sometimes you'll hear it offset. I don't like this because then you're not getting the full energy of it but it all depends upon what style you want. A little subtle automated panning can give some nice motion to things and liven it up a bit.

* Delays

Delays are very easy to get right, all you have is feedback and dry/wet to tweak, maybe a filter. Just use your ears.

* Highpasses Are Your Friends

This is definitely important enough to give a whole section to.The bass is where mud can become very very apparent, so everything should be rolled off that doesn't need body to it.


* General EQ Tips

Cut before you boost, a lot of times you need to get rid of the conflicting voice instead of trying to fight it out between two or more. Trust your ears, don't go by the spectrum-it's good for finding harmonics to notch or checking the response of a room but that's about it. Normally, you want high Q, low gain filters, but again, trust your ears. The only way to really get a feel for the spectrum is to just fuck around with EQ for a while, but here's some rough general ranges if you're really clueless.

20-60-shirt shaking subbass. Most systems can't even reproduce this accurately. Only one voice can really fit in here, you have to decide if your bass or your kick will be on the bottom. Notch out harmonics of whatever shouldn't be here plus roll it off for good measure.

60-120-low end of the bass. Again, only one voice can really comfortably fit here-cut and notch out stuff that shouldn't be here.

120-300-the body of sounds lie here and a little above. It's crucial not to have interference here, but it's just as crucial to not kill the sounds getting rid of that. Starting with the sound design is the best way to get it right.

300-900-Mud. Surgically cut out portions of this on most sounds-others like pads or things in the background might need more aggresive EQ though. Again, trust your ears.

900-1200-Presence. Voices tend to compete here, so be careful you're not fighting them against one another.

1.2-3.5K-Bightness. As you get higher up, it becomes less theory and more intuition because different things have different complex upper harmonics. This is where ears are the most sensitive:1-2 db boosts here can sound like 6dbs elsewhere.

3.5-5K-Airiness. But brightness as well-like all of these ranges it's a continuum. Esses normally lie here but don't just cut off those, you gotta use multibands or else there's no liviliness to the vocals. It's a different kind of brightness here, more noisy.

5-8K-A lot of noisy stuff occupies this range. A lot of the character of a sound lies up here. Along with the hissy range above 8K. Hiss is good if it's imperceptible, gives the sound it's uniqueness but if it's too loud it's distracting and sounds bad.

* Your Glue

So you have your EQing done but it's just not grooving yet, doesn't sound cohesive. This is where the amateurs and the pros are separated: your verb. It's a lot about just using your ears:the size needs to fit the decay time and the density. Generally, the bigger the size space you're going for, the less high end you need. Longer predelays as well, along with less early reflection. And of course, the dry/wet needs to be dialed in correctly. Don't give much or any stereo field to things that need to be in the center.


* Use Them Ears

When in doubt, walk away, get a drink, wait 15 mins till it's out of your head. Sleep on it even. Then listen to your material again. It'll give you a little new perspective. Also, watch your levels, it's easy for them too creep right up on you.

Also,

* PROTECT THEM EARS!

You only get one set, so guard them jealously. This means no going down the street bumping your 1000w subs, no more loud venues without hearing protection, and to always watch the levels of your audio:it's even more irresponsible to damage your audience's ears.

1373641436.0	1i5mrp	Here are some tips on how to produce better sounding music at home	ardrew	378	53	134	"I've been recording music at home with computers for about 17 years now. I'm not a pro, I don't do it for a living, but it is a serious hobby for me that I put a lot of time into. 

I see lots of threads on here asking for help to make your home recordings and mixes sound better. Here are some things that I've learned over the years that may be helpful to others.

Note for the pedantic among you: none of these tips are hard and fast rules. There are situations where almost all of them wont apply. Take what works for you and adapt it, ignore what doesn't.

1. When recording an input try to get the input volume to be as loud as possible without clipping. Clipping is the enemy. You'd rather have an overall quieter signal amplified in post processing than a loud signal with clipping all over it. Quiet can be fixed, clipping can't.

2. Record dry, add effects in post. The goal of recording is to capture the performance and dynamics in as clean a form as possible. With a good clean performance the sky is the limit tonally. When you record wet you paint yourself into a corner. This may not be applicable for some folks, but in 9 out of 10 cases make this part of your workflow.

3. Mix via EQ. Relative track volumes are important, but arguably less important than getting each track into its own portion of the frequency spectrum. Every track should have a pre-fader EQ on it that you use to shape the sound. Your vocals shouldn't have bass transients stepping on your bass guitar. Your drums should punch in the kick, snare, and hats, but not have lots of useless spectrum ties up where the vocals and guitars sit. If you get every track shaped right with EQ mixing will be a lot easier, and sound a lot better.

4. Learn compression. It can be hard to grasp, and it can be hard to hear when you are doing it right, but learn it. Done right compression will tighten almost everything up. It'll make your bass guitar pop, it'll make your drums punch, and it'll even out your vocals so they sound consistent and professional. Spend time learning this. It will set you apart.

5. Double and triple track vocals. This doesn't apply 100% of the time. For example, if your vocalist has an incredible voice you may want a single track so all of the dynamics of the performance can come out. But if your vocalist is a normal/average rock/indie/pop/whatever vocalist then double or triple track the vocals. They'll sound more cohesive and generally better.

6. Unless you want to go for a specifically cold, sparse, or empty sound add a droning sound that sits low in the mix and runs through the entire track. Electronically produced music can sound too clean. It can lack ""space"" or sound artificial. Some of this has to do with the psychoacoustic effect of hearing a zero signal when there's nothing going on. In real life there's never no sound. Take a pad, or some sound, and drone it low in the mix (barely audible) through the whole track. Just leave it there and ignore it. It will take up the space hiss and recording noise would have taken up back in the day. It will make things sounds ""more real.""

7. A little bit of reverb on (almost) everything. Take a decent reverb, turn the signal mix to 90+% dry and put it on (almost) everything. Adjust mix % up and down per track as appropriate. This will go a long way to filling out your sound. Not appropriate 100% of the time, but a lot of the time.

8. You probably want delay on your vocals, not reverb. Reverb can work on vocals, and plenty of people use it. But many times delay is a better fit for vocals. It provides much of the same psychoacoustic effect of thickening the sound up and reinforcing the notes but delay has the added benefit of not adding extra frequencies into the mix that then have to be shaped. I find delay works better with most vocalists and most vocal performance. A stereo delay image is really great. For best results put all 2 or 3 of your vocal track through a single bus with EQ, compression, and a nice stereo delay.

9. Practice good digital recording hygiene. Name your tracks something descriptive. Name your projects something description. Color code tracks and group them. Keep your project folders organized. Backup, backup, backup, backup. This stuff pays off and makes you more productive and keeps you from losing work. Take your work seriously in this regard.

10. Technique is more important than equipment. I get better mixes out of a 100$ audio interface, $250 monitors, and GarageBand than most other folks get out of much higher end stuff. Don't try to throw money at a technique problem; that better plugin or DAW wont make your mix sound better if your tracks are all EQ'ed like crap, tracks are clipping on input, and your mix is mushy. Put in the time, experiment, and get good at the craft. Then throw equipment at it :)

11. Leave headroom in your mix. Let your mastering engineer squash it if that's what you want.

Hope this stuff helps some folks.

EDIT: Bonus point I thought of:
Plan your stereo image. Don't pile everything up dead center, and don't haphazardly throw things around the stereo image. Plan your stereo image such that competing or contrasting performances are in different spaces. You might pan your guitars hard L &amp; R, a pino or synth slight mid right, vocals dead center, hats slight left, and strings mid right, etc. Just like with EQ use the stereo image to give things space."	t5_2qmah	True

**Top Ways To Not Completely Eat Shit on Tour**

1. Do NOT hire a tour manager. This one comes with a big caveat. Only do this if you have your shit together, broadly speaking. If you are decent at numbers, care about how things shake out at the end of the night, and are not intimidated by having some semblance of responsibility for your own career, you can totally do this yourself. It's really not rocket science. If you are the kind of person that likes being on time, and can book a flight to somewhere in the continental US on your own, you will be very good at self tour managing. While it is work, so is touring. This right here will save you 10-20% in commission, as well as the expense of an extra person. I have done this for many tours, even when I am responsible for a crew of five. If you choose your band members/merch person/driver wisely, you will avoid herding cats.

2. Hire a tour manager, if you are a. bad with numbers, b. determined to spend your mornings face down in a pile of cocaine infused puke, or c. generally don't like being responsible for yourself. While I say this last part with some modicum of sarcasm, really, you'd be surprised. Some people just aren't built like that. I have met a lot of musicians who would rather have a bad guy to take the blame than to be responsible for their own fuck-ups.

3. Buy a vehicle to tour in. This may seem elementary, but some folks rent for years before taking the plunge. Live music isn't going anywhere soon. Plus, if your band implodes, you have a head start on that fruit basket delivery service you've had your eye on.

4. Make merch people actually want. Posters are great, kids love 'em and they are easy to store and transport. Find a local artist who can screen-print, get them to run off a small batch, and restock as needed. T-shirts are second best in terms of something people always want. It's tempting to go for some cutesy mercy thing that nobody else has, but a lot of them are duds. So unless you're determined to roll out smorgasbord style, stick to the stuff that actually works. One item does not fit all. I know some artists who still can kill on CDs. I can't. C'est La Vie.

5. If at all possible, hire folks with experience touring. If you take a greenhorn, make absolutely sure you won't be babysitting. Take people you would want to be marooned on an island with, the kind of folks with interesting shit to talk about other than music. I guar-an-fucking-tee that you are not going to want to debate which Zep' album is definitively their best by day 13 or day 26. East coast scrabble champ 2007-2009? Sign me up. Opinionated annoying music encyclopedia? 'Scuse me while I fucking choke myself to death. While this won't always affect your bottom line, successful touring is best thought of as buying a timeshare; it pays off incrementally over many years. One three-week stint with a complete dickface can sour you to the whole idea.

6. Get yourself a good booking agent. This is frankly easier said than done, but still very much worth it. My booking agent is arguably my most valuable business relationship, I definitely would not be where I am today without him. A good agency can both save you, and yield you considerable sums. I often talk to artists who can't find an agency to take them on, thus, I know this can be hard to source. Nevertheless, get in where you fit in. For what they do the commission is without a doubt worth it.

7. Pretend you joined the army. This may sound like a joke, but honestly, two of the most important things one can possibly do is to a. stay clean, and b. eat well. You know how they say that in the military, they tell you not to touch your face for sanitary reasons? It's true. If you love picking bogs, you better stop now, cause you are entering ground fucking zero for germs and shit. For food stock up on rations. Peanut butter, dried fruits and nuts, soymilk and cereal-- all your friends, pizza and Micky D's are not. Cancelled shows equal a sure fire way to fuck your money up quick.

8. Know what a properly functioning show looks like. Don't know? Watch. I have been telling myself this for years, so don't take this as being rude. The most valuable thing you can do in most situations is shut the fuck up and listen. Opening slot on a big  tour for the Blah Blah's? Sit back and absorb. If you know what the contour of an evening looks like, you can identify when something is wrong. I have been in many situations where a show was a total clusterfuck, and if I didn't step in and make things happen (backline, soundcheck, set times, etc), no one would have picked up the pieces on my behalf. Most nights, it's clear what roles people play. Other times, you exist in a responsibility vacuum. This, again, is where tour managing yourself can be a big help; there are times where you won't have time to get 3 parties to talk to each other, you just need to make shit happen, and happen now.

9. Sell your own merch. I guarantee this will double or triple your sales. It just does.

10. Don't be an asswipe. I've gotten gigs from promoters, kids, activity club directors, etc, just from them saying ""Oh, we had him last year and he wasn't difficult at all, not like artist X was, jesus that guy sucked"". You can be supremely talented and popular and people will put up with your shit to book you. You will also be the 3%, sooner or later they become one of the rest of us 97%ers. And when that happens, you don't want to be that guy. It's really not hard, just pretend that you're the same guy that was stacking boxes 5 years ago for $9/hr, before you ""hit the big time"". You will have to revert to him sooner or later anyway, as we all do, so you might as well just be him ALL the time."	t5_2qmah	True

Thank you.

**So what do I need help with?** Well, I need help developing the platform. I know enough HTML, CSS, and PHP to get by, but not enough to build the platform.  I also don't have any money to pay a developer! Since day 1 I have run Radio Rebel without paying myself a dime. And as of now, Radio Rebel does not even make enough to sustain itself. I pay for everything out of pocket. 

I have been actively honing my development skills, but this is proving very slow, and I feel that by the time I am good enough, I will need to completely rethink my ideas.  This is why I need help! I am searching for a talented developer who is willing to dedicate themselves to the cause of changing the music industry, and who is willing to take a risk with me. 


I have *dedicated my life* to this project. I *will not stop* until I am successful. 

If there is anyone out there that can help me, please do. Let's change the world.

___________________________________

**Edit:** I would like to shed some insight on part of the plan to make this idea a reality.  

**Stage 1:** Get musicians interested in Radio Rebel's independent radio station. - CHECK

**Stage 2:** Build a prototype of the ""free to sell digital distribution platform"". 

**Stage 3:** Launch a kickstarter and/or indiegogo campaign. Contact numerous media outlets to get exposure for the campaign. Also, musicians that are already involved with RR will totally be willing to give us their support.

**Stage 4:** Use funding from crowd sourcing to complete the platform, purchase necessary equipment and paid marketing.

**Stage 5:** Launch! Cross fingers.

I was going to set up a website for it a while ago but i have a feeling it may take off a little better here. It really came about as looking at my Ableton Live project folder and i currently have 174 projects, of which only 20ish are properly finished tracks, it would be great to upload some of the best bits of some and see where people can take them!

I see there are lots of talented people here on reddit from all sorts of disciplines but collaboration is always a daunting prospect, often relying on constant communication and trust. What i am proposing is a more open source approach or perhaps with the use of the various creative commons agreements.

As an instrumentalist/vocalist etc you record yourself and upload your riff or stem with a little info about it and/or a suggestion as to its use. And as a producer you can download this material and use it for free in your tracks and upload your finished/wip material that perhaps someone else can take even further.

Of course there is plenty of room for everything in-between such as uploading stems from your tracks or partly finished projects like i mentioned earlier but the emphasis would have to be on original material and not just interesting riffs that you like/found that you would like to hear in a tune.

I feel that this is something radio reddit could very much get behind too and would provide a nice stream of original content!
Anyway, if there is any interest then we can set something up and see where it goes. Not sure about names at the moment tbh but i was thinking something like ""Tracklab"" or ""MusicWorkshop"".


**Edit: its done!**


http://www.reddit.com/r/letsallmakemusic/

While setting up i did find a similar subreddit for collaborating (r/musicinthemaking) but it was kind of the opposite of what I'm proposing by having everyone upload as they wish.

I'm only finishing up watching part 3 and as a producer/aspiring composer, this video is insanely insightful and inspirational. Now anybody looking to compose some orchestral stuff will obviously jizz all over this but even if you don't, i'd still watch carefully because this guy (though headless as he is throughout the duration...annoying) does a wonderful job at explaining all the little countless compositional decisions that one makes when trying to form the construct of a piece, from themes and melodies, to chords and even orchestration.

It's long as hell as you may need some coffee but hearing this guy explain his process will, at the VERY LEAST, give you an insight into composition for whatever genre you may specify in.

**EDIT 2:** I'm really happy we are actually discussing this! Now if anyone reads this I don't know but there are quite a few people I'd like to address collectively on an issue that seems to be popular in this debate. So the song is, ""Shitty pop music."" But what right do you have to be an  asshole about it? I personally have a friend here in the DFW area (PM me if you wanna know who) who has a ton of local fans and they play punk music. Straight up, 4 chords over and over again, punk music. Now I know from experience playing with him that he is a talented musician and could easily play a plethora of other things, but he always comes back to punk, because he enjoys it! Now the post we have been arguing about was a comment in a ""shitty pop"" post, and I guess it really got to me because I could see one of my best friends posting something very similar. Not for the fame and fortune, but just to build feedback and get his stuff out there, which is what we all essentially want, and there is nothing wrong with that. I say if you wanna make ""shitty pop"" music then fucking go for it and nobody deserves to be shat upon for making music they love. Until you ask OP, ""*Hey, why did you make this song? Was it just to appease a larger crowd, or is it because you love and appreciate music in all its forms?*"" then you can keep your comments civil or at least give constructive feedback if you're gonna be a rude asshole."	t5_2qmah	True

Bad customer service 8Dio. Really bad."	BlackAera	343	71	115	"So you might know 8Dio for making cool Kontakt libraries and Instruments for digital music production and they just released a new lib called 8Dio Dubstep which is basically reFX Nexus but only for Dubstep. It costs you 180$ and has a few drumkits and many sampled basslines, leads, wobbles, vowels and such. It has a nice keyboard layout and you can change pitch and add fx on the fly with the keys. It's good for performing if you know what you are doing. Pretty cool right? Right?!

Well it's certainly NOT cool that they deleted my comment on Youtube where I said you could get better software like Massive, Absynth 5 or FM8 or Monark + Razor for the same price and actually learn how to use these synths and that their one trick pony is an overpriced preset machine. Others were agreeing with me but their comments are gone as well. That was yesterday.

Today I wanted to check if my second and third comment were still there but instead I found that 8Dio had removed themselves from my subs, blocked me on their channel and deleted all my comments. Replies leading to deleted comments by thirds were still there to be found and more and more users are complaining about the issue. No statement from 8Dio so far.

Like I told them before, you should market your product properly (because the videos are a bit laughable if you are beyond beginner level and know the terms) and price it reasonably if you want to sell it. And if you can't that is your own fault honestly but you should never compensate your failure by muting everyone who sees your bullshit and calls you out on it. This is NOT how you communicate with your customers 8Dio. I was interested in some of their products lately but I changed my mind. I am not supporting a company with such fucked up business practices.

I ask everyone who wants to support the majority of the audience to drop a comment on their Dubstep videos found on their channel [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/user/8dioproductions) and discuss the topic with like minded producers on KVR, Gearslutz or whatever place you like to go to (if you feel the need) because let's be honest, this is the most terrible way to treat your customers and no company should ever act like that if they want to keep their position and reputation in the market. They blocked me from participating in the discussion and they don't seem to want me watch their videos anymore. Looks like they don't want or need my money. They could just close business right now if that's their mindset. Good for me. So yeah, fuck 8Dio. I am spending my money elsewhere. Thinking about upgrading my K8 to K9 with the saved cash. Monark, Session Strings, The Giant and a set of new mixing tools certainly look like a good deal. Image Line has a 50% offering now too since FL Studio 11 hit the market.

1289779565.0	e640p	Key points I've learned after making electronic music for 10 years.	ElGreatScott	293	23	102	"I want to post this here in hopes that some of the aspiring folks will find some technical nuggets of wisdom. 

Some quick background first: I REALLY started from scratch. I started messing around with composition on computers a bit over 10 years ago, doing basic MIDI manipulations in Junior High. When I wanted to start making dance music proper in high school, I had access to almost zero resources for learning: no friends into it, no YouTube tutorials, not really any tutorials in general.  Making music on computers was *just* on the verge of becoming a workable route to take. 

It's been a long journey. About two years ago I started getting my first legit deals with labels that have proper distribution (beatport/addictech/etc) and marketing.

Here are some simple things I've learned:

1. ""It's not what you have, it's how you use it."" - This may have made more sense ""back in the day"" when people having full-blown studio rigs was much more common.  This can lead to a feeling of inadequacy when you start reading forum threads where people with ""real jobs"" brag about their rigs. Don't let it get to you. I know plenty of producers nowadays who make excellent music on modestly powered computers, running all open-source SW, and nothing more than a cheap MIDI controller, a pair of decent headphones, and a decent soundcard.

2. The best way to learn is to f$ck around. Pure and simple. Tutorials are great for expanding your knowledge, but nothing compares to pulling teeth (I'm a masochist) opening up an app or a piece of hardware with a completely alien UI, and just messing around with options/params/banging keys. Not only will you eventually get extremely comfortable with it, but you'll have the added benefit of discovering new ways to do accomplish things/make new sounds along the way that other people haven't thought of! Don't rely solely on tutorials.

3. Don't expect to make banging tunes in any short-term time frame (a few years) unless you have some good outside help. I didn't. It took me 8 years. I know a few folks who get it down solid in &lt; 2 years, but they tend to have close friends who are already talented that are able to provide hands-on help. I kept at it because I enjoyed it.

4. There are 3 important skills to develop: a) Writing/making music b) Proper mixing c) Mastering. A lot of people tend to focus on (a), expecting that a label will take care of (b) and (c) for them. I'm not saying you need to become the next engineering superstar, but you definitely want to become proficient in mixing and mastering to a point where you can roughly polish things. Submitting a roughly polished track to a label can make a huge difference in catching their interest. After the label wants it, then you can provide the unmastered version for their people to take care of.

5. The process of mixing and mastering is really different in electronic vs acoustic music. Don't get lost in the wrong area when trying to pick up on this stuff.

6. Think in the frequency domain. Making a song ""sound good"" (melody/sequencing aside), comes down to being able to properly carve out the frequencies of your layers. If there's too much frequency overlap in your synths/bass/drums/etc, things will sound muddy. On the flip-side, if there's too much frequency separation, things can sound bland. Something to be aware of when creating parts/layers.

7. I'm really glad I learned piano, but didn't listen to my teachers. I took classical piano. Hated it. I spent all my practice time making things up / trying to mimic the melodies of other songs I liked. I 100% suck at site-reading music, but I learned how scales work and how to make things up within them so they sounded good. Jazz piano would have probably been better in retrospect. Also take some music theory if you can.

8. Don't pull all of your inspiration from other electronic music. That's a quick way to make really generic tracks.

9. Constantly ask trusted sources for feedback. Ideally from other producers who have a good ear / are putting good things out (the pros). Don't always expect good news. When I say ""trusted"" I mean people who aren't afraid to criticize your work and tell you what they truly think about it / what they would do to your song if they were in your shoes.

10. Never get full of yourself or your work.

11. Make music because you enjoy it... not to make money or get famous... this will subsequently increase your chances of making money and getting famous.

12. Constantly analyze the music of artists you admire. Take it apart. Try to pick out all the layers and fx.

EDIT: A clarification for #4. Labels are generally expected to take care of mastering for you. Not always mixing. It's good to get a rough handle on both, for shopping your work around and being able to passably play out your own work in advance.

EDIT 2: By request from a few of you, here are some links to my work.

Any genre, I don't care if you've been playing for 10 years or 10 days (x-post from r/baseball, r/bbq)	theshinepolicy	312	46	272	"Hello r/music! You may remember me from such timeless reddit classics as ""I'm drunk at a Nickleback concert AMA"", and ""Sean Hannity just asked me I'd kill a 10-year old hitler."" I am a piano player and songwriter and have been playing music with a singer from Nashville for the past seven years, and was planning on moving back there this summer to work on taking the next step with a new band. Recently, she told me she doesn't think we can work together anymore, due to personal reasons. This came as a big surprise to me and it has been very painful to have something I've put so much of myself into taken away so abruptly.

Instead of sitting around feeling sorry for myself (ok, i did do that for a few days), I decided that I wanted to take advantage of the fact that for the first time, I have absolutely no obligations to anyone or anything this summer. I've sold most of my furniture and am packing a car with my keyboards, my camera, and a blow up mattress and will be traveling across the United States to live deep and suck the marrow out of life, playing music with anybody that has a song to sing, and seeing what the heart of this great country has to offer.

[Here is a map of the cities I will be passing through](http://i.imgur.com/1PfltNU.jpg)

I have four goals for this road trip.

1. Play music and go to concerts with other music lovers.

2. Visit various baseball stadiums across the country.

3. Eat the best BBQ the heartland has to offer.

4. Figure out what the fuck to do with the rest of my life.

In some of the cities, I will be staying with friends. In others, I'll be couchsurfing. In some cities, I have no idea where I'm going to stay. If you live in or around any of the cities I'm visiting, and are not an axe murderer, I would love to meet up and jam, or go to a show, or just have a beer and talk about music.

Maybe this is a bad idea, but I'm kind of having a mid life crisis and am starting to not really give a shit. I'll put up a list of cities and dates if this post gets any interest. OK! Should probably start packing...

Fuck pay to play or pay to apply. Its just people without musical talent making money off people that do. Sonicbids, Reverbnation and the like deserve to be shut down. 

If anyone has a convincing argument as to why this pay to apply model is a good thing please enlighten me.

Edit: OK I talk shit about Reverbnation and I still have an account. My problem with them is the free ""opportunities"" they off still requires you to have a $5/mo. digital EPK that they put together. Nickle and diming. Fuck that. We are already poor."	t5_2qmah	True
1333583013.0	rtrpc	In the last 24 hours, mostly while I slept, I got almost 1000 new soundcloud plays and 200 album downloads. I'm normally lucky to get 10 in that time. Words cannot describe.	AleaMinerva	299	34	57	"First things first, I am the archetypal bedroom musician. I don't gig, I barely promote and I just make music for music's sake to very little fanfare. So yeah, Tuesday morning I checked my soundcloud, as I do a couple of times a week. 15 plays. Tonight I check my soundcloud. 827 plays. I'm sure a lot of you have the same situation, check soundcloud, have a few extra plays since last time, close page. So imagine my surprise to see a huge spike of over 800 new plays, more than the entire album had accumulated since I released it almost 2 months ago. I was confused to say the least, I mean, they'd come from seemingly nowhere. Took me 15 minutes to think to check my downloads and sure enough, almost 200 new downloads since I had checked on Tuesday. Mind blown. I finally figured out what it was, I had lent one of my songs for a video for a [kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1047510073/remee-the-rem-enhancing-lucid-dreaming-mask?play=1&amp;ref=users) (from around 3:20), and checking the page I saw that in little under a day they had surpassed their $35,000 goal by a considerable margin, and thanks to them kindly linking to my site I had received a huge spike in traffic. If anyone's interested, [here's the song they used in the video](http://soundcloud.com/aleaminerva/alea-minerva-maybe-03-its-not), but really, I just wanted to share my happiness and to encourage people to grab every opportunity, because you never know which will pay off. My soundcloud is currently sitting at 984 plays (again, in just over a day!) and in a couple of months I'll get to see wether any of this translates in to genuine album sales via iTunes. If you read this far, thanks!

**EDIT**: You guys have only made this all the more surreal! Top post on WATMM?! Seriously, the level of positive feedback is far and beyond anything I could have hoped for, you guys are awesome, when I go to work at my shitty regular job today I'm gonna be goddamn invincible. Also, since I had no idea this would e so popular, here's the album download link I should have included in the first place: [www.aleaminerva.com](http://www.aleaminerva.com)

**EDIT 2**: The album is now on [Bandcamp](http://aleaminerva.bandcamp.com/album/maybe), thanks to those who pointed me in their direction.

1343107759.0	x25fr	An old friend was killed in Aurora, CO this weekend. This is all I have from his life. Please take a moment to honor his memory.	colonel_panic10	360	115	37	"Last weekend my friend Alex Teves was killed in a theater in Aurora, CO. I had not been in contact since we graduated high school but for a time we were very close. We both shared a passion for rock and blues music and on the weekend we would often get together and jam with some of our buddies. He was an excellent guitarist and by far the best out of our small group of aspiring musicians. On only one occasion did we ever record anything. The first 3 tracks in this set are the product of that recording session in my garage over 8 years ago. The final track is one that Alex recorded on his own and sent to me around the same time.

Since hearing the news of his death, I have been frantically trying to find some tangible memory or keepsake from our friendship. I was looking for a photo, a note, anything to supplement my fading memory of our time spent together. I scoured school yearbooks and old computers for photos but my search came up empty. I remembered our recording session well but I feared the music was lost forever. Last night I was finally able to find the original files on a noisy old hard drive roughly the size of a shoebox. 

Hearing Alex play the guitar after all these years was a deeply emotional experience for me. I was overcome by grief recalling the memory of his presence. He was a good humored and loyal friend and our shared experiences came back to me all at once. I saw him standing in my garage with his trademark white t-shirt and blue jeans shredding on an electric guitar. I remember sitting on concrete in the corner of our high school quad eating lunch together in the shade day after day. I remember knowing him almost exclusively by his last name because Teves seemed to fit better than Alex did at the time. I remember driving aimlessly around his neighborhood in our friend's van so we could appropriately rock out to Cream's ""White Room"" until the final note. I remember a series of events that escalated quickly from watching Fight Club for the first time to starting a short-lived and dreadfully misguided boxing club in his back yard. I remember when he introduced me to an obscure little blues-rock band called The Black Keys. I remember video games, Jones soda and laughing until it hurt to breathe.

Though we were close for only a few teenage years, I can never forget the joy and warmth I felt being his friend. In the days since his untimely passing his closest friends have posted photos and memories to piece back together a life that was shattered in a senseless and violent act. It's not much but this is my part. When I hear him play guitar in these recordings, if only for a moment, my old friend is alive again. 

Rest in peace Alex Teves.

Therefore you have time to listen to other people's music and comment on it too.  

I have seen forums and music communities come and go due to the dominance of selfishness/self-promo and a lacking sense of community. A community based on selfishness will fall apart.  

**You guys really want this subreddit to be all it can be?  
I then declare this as an unofficial rule of [Listen] posts.**  

Keept at LEAST a 2:1 ratio. Feedback will KEEP THE MUSIC FLOWING.  You'd be surprised what some positive comments and constructive criticism can do for people who share the same desire to make good music as you do.  

Leave your selfishness at the door if you want people (especially your fellow music-makers) to listen to your music!
  
EDIT: Not even necessarily before posting. Returning feedback to people just to those who give it to you works even better in my past experience.

EDIT: So apparently I am being overly crass about this. Declaring an unofficial rule != Demanding. I'm not policing it nor do I plan on it being enforced. Some of you guys are pretty sensitive and I'm TRULY sorry if you were offended by me saying that. I'm just being realistic though. This is just a tough love post. If you guys REALLY think I am intent on creating a FORCED SYSTEM, you're mistaken. Unofficial rules aren't followed by all. They're just followed by those who trust that such a system works well. I can attribute a LOT of my development of skill and motivation to further my pursuits to such online (and offline) community interaction. Mutual expectation is not a chore if you don't make it out to be so terrible. It's not like I'm mad about the ""situation"" here. I just want to see this subreddit be a place for music-makers to thrive. You don't have to follow this ""rule"". You will probably just enjoy posting here a lot more once you get to know each other's music better.  

I have helped a lot of people improve their beat-making skills through giving constructive feedback and some tough love here and there. You can be selfish if you want as this is not r/pyongyang. If you're mad at me for being blunt, that's cool too.

My teacher taught me a few practice techniques that I wish I had known earlier.

1.  When learning a new chord shape, finger the chord and slowly arpeggiate downward.  If you hit a muted string (that isn't supposed to be muted), stop and start over.  Once you get all strings ringing, release your grip and clap your hands.  Repeat until you can grip the chord quickly and accurately.

2.  Also use the ""clapping"" technique for chord changes within a song (ie a quick turnaround).

TedKord	282	67	522	"Long story short - spent a decade learning several instruments, as well as how to write and sing. Wrote over 400 songs. Played many shows, had several bands, many fun times all around. Recorded a full-length album in a professional studio, as well as a few singles. Everyone said I was really talented, but nothing ever led anywhere.

Now I'm in my mid-20's, and I've got absolutely nothing to show for the last decade of my life. Times are tough for everyone, but especially for those with no college degree or trade skills.

Within the past several months, gradually I've cared less and less about music in general. It never gives me that feeling that it used to - playing, performing, or listening. Something inside me just gave up the ghost. I used to write prolifically, play all the time...record new ideas and chat with my musician buddies about how we'd move in together and start a studio home, where we could all record together. 

But one day I woke up and I was Joe Q. Public...just another guy. It was gone. Like it'd had never been there in the first place. Rock and roll to me now looks like a very childish, pretentious, and sophomoric thing to live for.

I'm probably going to start attending community college, and work my way towards an Associate's (and subsequently a Bachelor's), once I figure out what I'd like to do. 

I'm just wondering if this has happened to anyone else. At the end of the day, I was very, very fortunate to love something as deeply as I did, and to be able to pursue it to my heart's content. I'll never forget it so long as I live.

I see this come up in almost every thread. It seems that so many people think music theory is some instruction set or algorithm that will dictate their playing and style and not allow them to try new things.

**Here is my definition:**

As I see it, music theory is the name of the musical language. You learn how to read, write, make sentences, and form complex thoughts that others can read later an understand. Yes, you can learn this yourself by tinkering with things on your own, but it may never be as concrete (example: Am and C have the exact same notes in their scales. So you could solo over a tune/progression that is in Am with the C major scale). This is the same thing as with chemistry. Yes, you can learn all about atoms, compounds, etc on your own but it is much easier to get a chemistry book and go through it. Then you can start venturing into uncharted territory.

tr;dr: Music theory isn't some magical pixie dust. It's a tool to learn and communicate in the language of music so that other musicians can understand you quickly and easily."	t5_2qmah	True

Note that Pandora already has a sweetheart deal and pays less than the statutory rate, due to a deal cut with SoundExchange. It currently takes thousands of plays to make enough for dinner for a musician. Basically, the compensation becomes trivial.

What's really going on here is that Pandora isn't profitable. They basically want your music, want to make real money off it, and pay you essentially nothing. Which is slightly (slightly) more than they pay now.

It is corporate greed at its finest, masked at fairness.

I will most definitely contact Feinstein, as the letter suggests. But not with Tim's message.

-------------------------


Hi there,

This is Tim, the founder of Pandora.

I am writing to ask for your urgent help. An important piece of legislation has just been introduced in Congress that could end long-standing discrimination against Internet radio. **I'm asking that you contact your Senator to urge them to support the Internet Radio Fairness Act.**

This bipartisan bill will correct the incredible inequity in how different digital radio formats are treated under the law when it comes to setting royalties. The difference is quite extraordinary. In 2011, Pandora paid over 50% of our revenues in performance royalties, while SiriusXM paid less than 10%.

As a lifelong musician, I'm fully supportive of artist compensation, but this situation can't continue. Internet radio is bringing millions of listeners back to music, and is playing the songs of tens of thousands of promising artists who would otherwise never be heard. It should be given a fair chance to succeed. 

To voice your support for this initiative, please reach out to your Senator today and say you support the Internet Radio Fairness Act, bill number 3609.

Senator: Dianne Feinstein

Washington D.C. Office Number: 202-224-3841

You can also tweet your representative: @SenFeistein


If you'd like more information about the Internet Radio Fairness Act you can learn more here. 

It's crucial that Congress hears from fans of Internet radio today. Thanks for your support, and thanks for being a loyal listener.
 
Tim Westergren

Founder, Pandora


 
**EDIT:** The main thing I'm learning here is that most of you don't know the real numbers involved at all. I've put a detailed response to one poster here, about the actual, published data on Pandora's financials. Here's some hard info:

The most common thing being said here is that Pandora pays, as one poster put it, ""the vast majority of their revenue"" to artists. The actual figure is 60%, hardly a ""vast majority"". In the last fiscal quarter, that meant Pandora had *over 40 million dollars after paying royalties, to run their company*. That's for a 3 month period, or about 13.3 million dollars *per month*. 

Pandora is working to expand. That costs money. Rather than make a profit, they *chose* to work a business plan that precludes profits. They are not inherently ""unprofitable"" at all. They simply are taking a business plan that requires artists to subsidize their expansion.

**EDIT2**: Here is some info on the exec pay, from April 2012:

*CEO Joseph Kennedy:  $732,425

*CFO Steven Cakebread - $446,400

*CTO Thomas Conra - $3.4 million

*CMO Simon Fleming-Wood - $2.7 million

*CRO John Trimble - $4.6 million

So that's a total of about 11.9 million dollars, going to 5 people. Another way to look at it is that they are taking out close to a full month's profit, just for the 5 of them. Do you think that should be further subsidized by musicians?"	t5_2qmah	True

To contextualize, Ive been producing music for 2 years, ive played instruments for about 8 and Ive been happy with my work on and off for only about the past 6 months.
I had been labeling myself as a dubstep/ EDM genre producer for about a year and been solely pumping out bass music... until very recently.
Ive started just sitting down and making tracks, very simple sound design (eg, sin waves with soft distortion, supersaws) and it feels so much better to just make the music that comes naturally to me.  thats not to say dont make genres that you like, but when youre not feeling inspired to make that raw electro track youve been dreaming of, just sit down and play.  It feels so rewarding to create a piece that is not limited by genre specific conventions.

to the more experienced producers on reddit what do you guys think?

TL;DR: stop forcing genre boundaries in your music and just make music

The melody is just so familiar to my ear. I just afraid to continue this tune.

My english isn't very good, if you don't understand, so maybe it's the same case as Mccartney's Yesterday:

&gt;McCartney's initial concern was that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work (known as cryptomnesia). As he put it, ""For about a month I went round to people in the music business and asked them whether they had ever heard it before. 

&gt;Eventually it became like handing something in to the police. I thought if no-one claimed it after a few weeks then I could have it.""

&gt;Upon being convinced that he had not robbed anyone of their melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it.

So /r/WATMM , have you ever been in this case? Is there any solution to know if I am plagiarizing someone else' song or not?

Thanks in advance."	t5_2qmah	True

Grooveshark: mostly a ghost-town now, esp compared to its heyday. But maybe 2 years ago, I spent $100-150 on promo. Results were pretty good: got a lot of new fans, and some of them actually bought my music. But it's a dead site now, for the most part.

ReverbNation: I spent less than $100, and the results weren't great. The ads they place on FB require the listener to go thru that complex ""accept terms and give your info to reverbnation"" nuttiness that people hate. Not recommended.

Noisetrade: have you seen their newsletters and website? Wow, the musicians on the front seem OH SO indie, with beards! And flannel! And beards! They MUST be authentic! Nope, you pay $1000 for a front-page and newsletter feature. Has anyone tried this? I'm on Noisetrade as an artist and have gotten like 50 downloads without paying for promo, and you'll get the downloaders' email addresses, but that seems like an awful lot of cash just for the pleasure of giving your music away for free.

AAM College radio promo: I live in NYC, so I gave em a shot.  Something like $200-300, and they got me on several college radio stations in the US.  But I get the feeling that in order to make a serious effort, you'll need to spend like several thousand dollars with them, and I'm not sure college radio is very high-yield for promo.  Anyone else?

Spotify: THE big daddy, IMO. Huge listener base, so the ads will have a lot of penetration. But the cost? Oh sweet Jesus: minimum of $10k, which runs promo for a month. MINIMUM! So next time you see a hard-scrabble, bearded, poverty-stricken, authentic musician being promoted on Spotify, realize it's costing well over $10,000. There's your fucking indie DIY for you.

So, what have you guys got?

"" so I explain why it's a shit idea. He then screams at me: WHEN THE FUCK DID THE SOUNDMAN START TELLING THE BAND WHAT TO DO!? 

Well I'll tell you when; when we learned to rig a the line array ( with a crane so it didn't fall on your head ) and a digital FOH desk and a monitor desk and the monitors so you can sound fucking great and ran all the cabling and spent two days in a warehouse preping the rig and then a day setting the rig up with analyser software and tools that are way over your head and then waited all afternoon for you to turn up late, play half an hour soundcheck and then an hour onstage and then break it all down at the end of the night till 3am when all I want to do is go home to my beautiful GF, get into bed and play with her awesome tits whilst you're still dicking about doing drugs and trying to find *yourself* chatting up an under-age groupy at some aftershow party that's not even for your band. THAT'S FUCKING WHEN!

So that's like, 36hours of work for your 1 hour of fun and 1/2 hour of whinging.

It's pretty simple - you choose one of your tracks, and it gets put into rotation in your city. People that hear your track can easily follow you on services like bandcamp or social networks like facebook, and can buy tickets to your next show.

We've also tried to make it as lightweight as possible. In my last band, I had more than 10 accounts at different online services - we're trying to avoid adding another one. We pull your tracks from SoundCloud, so you don't have another account to keep updated.

We're launching the public (player) side of Radius soon, but if you're an artist you can add a track now. It doesn't cost anything to use Radius.

We're really excited - the ability to put your tracks in front of people in your city that have never heard of you before is huge, and it's something we all wish we would have had available in our previous bands.

We'd love to hear your thoughts/suggestions. Radius is being updated every day, and we're constantly incorporating feedback from musicians.

If you'd like to add a track, here's the link:
[Artist signup](http://getradi.us/signup)

If you're more interested in finding local artists in your city and you'd like to help us beta-test in the next few days, there's a signup page here:

Tonight we had an event called ""Ableton Musical Chairs"" which involved every person attending to bring a laptop with Ableton on it, and headphones.  You start at your computer and create for 15min, and when the time is up... you know the drill.  Switch to the next computer.   9 people were in attendance and the end result was excellent!  9 new pieces that were very different, yet progressed in unique ways.  

This will help you not only learn to create on the fly, but learn to work with other people and machines outside of your comfort zone.  We will have another event next week and looking forward to this being a monthly event!

Try it with even 2 other friends.  You'll be surprised at what comes out!

1356188385.0	15a4ya	20 common mistakes made by aspiring musicians and bands.	mathazar	339	149	246	"This is mostly geared toward live performance. These are some of the mistakes I've made and mistakes I commonly see from local bands.

1. Songs too long. Unless you're going to change something, 3 choruses is enough.

2. Songs too repetitive. 16 bars of that verse riff is too much. The song needs to grow and change. See #1.

3. Playing guitar solos out of key. Doesn't matter how fast you shred if you're playing noise.

4. Bad appearance. If you're going on stage, don't look like you just rolled out of bed. People are there to see you. Wear something interesting, or a least look like you belong in a band.

5. Not changing it up. Predictable is boring. Put a stop, tempo change, or something unexpected. Make sure all your songs don't sound the same. If you finish a song and start another one and it sounds the same, there's a problem.

6. Not harmonizing. Harmonies take vocals from good to great.

7. Standing still. Move around, people want to see something happening.

8. Not interacting with the audience. They paid to see your show, make them part of it. Don't ignore them. Don't look at your guitar/drums the whole time, look at the crowd.

9. Not interacting with your band mates. Have fun with the other people on stage.

10. Being too drunk on stage. What sounds awesome to you will sound sloppy to the audience.

11. Fiddling around making noise on your instruments between songs. Makes you sound like a high school garage band.

12. Begging people to come to the stage. Don't sound desparate. If they're feeling it, they'll go up there.

13. Not bringing extra guitars. Broke a string? Sorry, show's over.

14. Turning amps up too loud. Great, you have a half stack. We don't need it turned up to 11 in this small club. You just took all control away from the sound guy and you're burying the vocalist, who's now feeding back constantly.

15. Being out of tune. And we shouldn't hear you tuning either. Use a pedal tuner which mutes the guitar.

16. Too much downtime between songs. Keep the show moving.

17. Begging people to bring you shots/beer. If you suddenly run out of drink that's one thing, but don't be a bum.

18. Singing out of key. I feel like I shouldn't even have to write this, but it happens.

19. Playing a bunch of slow, boring stuff. Depends on the venue, but if it's a rock show at a bar, don't get all slow and depressing on them. They want to have a good time.

20. Not taking it seriously. Play every show like it's a big show, even if there are only 5 people there. Those 5 people may come back and bring friends next time.

Edit: I see a lot of comments here about how music is art and you should be able to do whatever you want. That's true. But I'm talking about how to be an engaging live performer and put on a great show. This comes from years of experience, and if you want to make it in the business, this is my advice. It's not enough just to write good material, you have to think about live performance. This list is geared more towards certain styles, genres and venues and there are definitely exceptions depending on what you're going for."	t5_2qmah	True

1353865779.0	13rljt	Guitar Tab Wiki Pitch	mintmouse	218	31	98	"**I'm going to come right out and say it. I hate tablature websites. Here's why:**

* **Obstructive Ads** - Sure, lots of us use AdBlock, and sure, websites need to cover costs, but the ads on tablature sites have reached porn-level proportions. Banner ads would be fine, but no, there are pop-ups, screen-dimmers... it's a ridiculous amount of bloat when what you're attempting to access boils down to a .txt file.

* **No Consistency -** From tab to tab, there's little consistency. One person puts chord symbols above their tablature lines, another just lists chords, some space everything out evenly with time-counts underneath, others write a blurb saying listen to the song for timing. And yes, there are generally accepted symbols for things like slides and hammer-ons, but someone always has to be different.

* **Bogus / Incomplete Info -** This one gives you the right chords, but not the intro lick. This one has the lick, but his chords are all wrong. This one might be right, but the tab lines are all skewed, so you'll never know. This one has the chords for the entire song written out in one line, or are those notes? You've got to love the guy who posts a tablature which consists of five notes of the melody.

* **Redundancy -** Many songs have 5 or 10 versions posted, and if they're popular, you might see 20 or 50 versions. A lot of these ""versions"" are basically identical. This means you get to have a fun time clicking through *at least* four or five before you find one that isn't garbage.

**But, what if it didn't have to be that way?**

* **Clean, Organized Wiki Design -** A few well-placed, unobtrusive banner ads. An option to donate. Fast-loading, light design.

* **Community-Enforced Style -** Style guides to ensure tabs are all in one format.

* **""One song, one tab"" -** This statement is a bit oversimplified (obviously some songs have two or more guitars, and would require a tab for each - also, obviously if the artist has an alternative version, like an acoustic version, it would warrant it's own tab) but you get the idea. Let's cut out all those duplicates. In wiki format, things are collaborative and errors can be corrected, so we'd have one version, and it would be the most complete and most accurate.

* **Only see what you want -** Collapsible sections (for instance, ""intro"" or ""solo #1) with the option to print any of them à la carte. Toggles for lyrics, chord charts, time counts, etc.

I woke up last friday, checked my page, and noticed 2000 new followers. Needless to say, compared to my original 100 something (all friends/fellow musicians), I was floored. They kept coming in by the thousands every day, and continue to! Right now I'm dangerously close to 12,000, and Im getting about one new follower every 2 minutes.

I've tried messaging a ton of them, and only one responded, saying: ""I dont know... i just log me and i hear your your tack so i follow ;)""

1372945049.0	1hms55	App that makes music critique fun...looking for some feedback	navajoknows	219	35	84	"**EDIT: a few people have been asking to be kept updated about the project. If you pm me your email address, i'll make sure to let you know of any progress.** 

So for the last few months I've been working on a mobile app idea for songwriters who want to find out if their music is any good. I regularly use /r/songwriters/ and other music forums, but they don't really work all that well - as most people just post their own stuff and don't bother listening to others. I think this is because giving feedback on songs isn't that fun, so you need to make the process more engaging.

Below is the idea I came up with. This is the kind of app I can imagine using myself, but I want to know what other musicians think. I work around the app industry and have got it costed roughly - it's not too prohibitive. Here's a basic breakdown:

* You open-up the app and - via the SoundCloud API - see your library of SoundCloud tracks - pick a track you want to share and hit 'publish'
* That track gets pushed out to five random users of the app, who receive a notification on their smartphone
* They listen to the track and rate it either ""OK"", ""good"" or ""great""
* If it's ""OK"" the track pushes out to 1 more random user, if it's ""good"" it goes out to two more users, and ""great"" goes out to three.
* The process repeats and the track continues spreading virally throughout the app userbase, seeing how many listens it can get in a set period of time (like two weeks or something).
* There's an animated UI that uses the metaphor of a garden. So you get to see your tracks as seeds, which eventually grow into plants. The more listens you get the bigger the plants. This will 'gamify' the experience and make it more rewarding. For instance, if you rate a lot of tracks you'll 'level up' and get virtual items to customise your garden with etc.
* Then there'll be a blog that publishes the top ten tracks each week.

**EDIT:** a few quick points I didn't originally mention that people are asking about - 

* Yes there will be an optional genre filter of some kind
* You have to rate a certain number of tracks for each track you upload
* You can have the option of breaking-down ratings into different aspects of the track to get more detailed feedback (such as production, vocals, lyrics, etc - thanks to evan274!) 

I think the key appeal is that critiquing becomes 'fun' and you don't need to spend ages building up a following on SoundCloud or YouTube in order for people to listen to your stuff. Everyone starts off equally, with five random listeners (not fans or friends) and it grows from there. At the very least, it will be a interesting new way to share your SoundCloud tracks.

We're a non-profit organisation who started out building software for radio stations to use webradio in conflict zones. Turns out these stations were ahead of their time - we're now seeing lots of musicians, DJs and community radios not only adopt the software, but help us build it too (meaning the original users get improved features!).

Airtime lets you upload music to a server and then schedule a bunch of smart playlists or live shows (e.g. rebroadcast a webstream from your mobile), which then stream over the web.

Airtime is free and open source and we'd love your feedback. There's a free online demo over at http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/

Linux fans can self-install the full version for free, or we offer a free 30 day trial of a paid cloud-hosted service that helps fund further development.

Enjoy.	rubwrongways	215	37	69	"**Food:**  One meal from the cheap-meals menu must be supplied to each band member at that band member’s expense.  Meal must be delivered one minute before band is scheduled to perform, so that it sits cooling and drying for several hours until after the show, at which time the band will throw it away.

**Dressing Room:**  A moldy basement, ill-lighted supply closet, or sticky area next to the stage must be provided for the band.  All walls must be painted black.  This area should be unusable due to all of the items stored there.  Suggestions: stacked chairs, old beer kegs, broken neon signs.

**Beverages:**  Venue must provide two beverages at a partially-discounted price to each band member.  Beverages must be of the lowest quality possible.  Bartender must not recognize drink tickets when presented.

**Stage:**  Band requires a tiny section of floor barely visible from anywhere else in the room.  Preferably there should be a floor-to-ceiling pole directly in front of this area.  If possible, please make sure that there are dripping pipes above the stage and that the entire area is poorly lit.
Sound System / Engineer: When band enters venue, nobody who has any knowledge of the evening’s performance must be in attendance.  Load in should be through a tiny kitchen door and up a steep set of stairs.

The stage area must have only one set of outlets.  One of these outlets must be broken.  There are, under no circumstances, to be extension cords in the venue.

Only one vocal microphone must be supplied for the four singers.  This microphone must be taped to a broken and wobbly microphone stand.  
No clips can be present.

There is to be no soundperson, especially if one was promised.  Please make sure the bartender leaves a few messages on the absent soundperson’s voice mail.  

Bartender must have no knowledge of the sound system or where any of the switches are.

**Promotion:** Venue must not display any of the flyers sent by the band.  The website must list a different band or a poker-night for the date of this show.  In a perfect world, the bartender and any other staff should have no knowledge of this show ever being booked and preferably they should be a bit annoyed that the band is there in the first place.

**Televisions:** The music venue must have three or more large screen televisions mounted on walls.  Various sports channels must be showing.  The volume should be set at a level that competes with the band’s music.  Preferably one of these TVs should be above and behind the band.

**Merchandising:**  The venue must provide the band with a small chair or shaky table on which to display their merchandise.  This unit must be placed in an unreachable and dark corner of the room.  When asked for this, the staff must act as though they have never heard of such a thing.

**Parking:** There is to be no parking provided for the band.

**Schedule:** Under no circumstances should the pre-planned and agreed upon schedule of performances be acknowledged.  Any bands performing before School for the Dead should take over half an hour to set up and break down.  

Their set should also be twice as long as promised.  The friends of this band should all leave immediately when SFTD begins performing.  If they do not leave, they must stand right up in the front with their backs to the band while yelling loudly to each other about how awesome their baseball caps are.

If possible, SFTD should be performing in a slot three or more hours later than was previously agreed upon. By the time they are finished, please make sure that the venue is empty and chairs are being stacked up on tables.

**Post-show:**  After the performance, venue staff should not look the band in the eyes.

**Police:** Please arrange for the band to be pulled over and ticketed on their way out of your city."	t5_2qmah	True

Second, a video [dissecting a genuine SM57 and a fake.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AwDvBZdRuo)

Finally, a gearslutz user, Meirone, posted this: G for genuine, F for Fake.

* Weight: the G will be heavier then the F in few grams.
* Color: the G is very dark gray, almost black. The F is deep gray, brighter the th G.
* Logo: The G has the mode and brand name printed on a metal band. On the F it's a simple plastic sticker.
* Pouch: The G has half matt finish. The F will be bright and shiny.
* Screwing: The gap between the body and the had of the mic is almost 1mm in the G while in the F it's less the 0.5mm
* Wires: The G has yellow and green wires connecting the body and the head. As for the F, well....
* Connector: On the G you'll find the brand name and the wiring numbers (1,2,3) in the connector.
* Sound: The G is deeper then the F. The fake will usually have unpleasent high-mids.
* Signal: If you make an A/B test, you'll find the F louder the the G.
* Feedback: Due to the said above, the F is more likely to feedback.

It's important to note that not all of the signs of a fake will always be present. Contacting Shure is a definitive route to identifying your mic. Additionally, my genuine mics have a blue dot, HOWEVER, I saw a lot that didn't.

Can I sue for Copyright infringement?	clarkismyname	222	46	71	"I know kind of off topic for this subreddit, but as it is music biz related thought it was the best chance to get someone who might really know. 

Ok, some details:  

I made a music video for a major label record company.  The contract for this project was a work made for hire (meaning that I promised to assign my copyright ownership to them for the compensation I received).   But the record company has not paid me a substantial portion of the contracted total.   

Any copyright lawyers out there who can answer this, or give me some insight?  Since I have not been paid, can I argue that I still retain the copyright for the work and threaten to sue them for infringement?   I know that you probably need to go over the details of the contract to know for sure, but I am just looking to see if such a precedent already exists.

In general, when doing a work for hire, are the assignment of those rights contingent on payment?  Or when entering such a contract are you assigning the rights right from the start?

What makes this most frustrating is that the Artist, Management and Label have all expressed how happy they are and that this video far exceeded their expectations...

Anyway sorry for bringing a downer to subreddit that usually brings me such joy.   Keep up making the beautiful music, you all inspire me. 

EDIT - I totally agree with all of you who are advising to get a lawyer and to see - but holding off a bit cause the 2 recommended to me sound like they will want a retainer that is 50% of what I am owed.   And my goal isn't to sue.  

My Goal is to make a legitimate enough sounding threat of pursuing an infringement case that they will just pay.  There is no argument that they owe the money or that the project is delivered as they wanted.  They just are not paying cause they have what they need, and they know the cost of pursuing this makes it foolish for me to try to collect through the courts.  

Hoping that there is a really cool lawyer out there on Reddit, who can tell me if in the US, non payment of a work for hire contract voids it, or at least sometimes does.  (In my mind this Lawyer is a really cool cat who plays Jazz on the weekends, still reads the newspaper cause he likes the feel of the rough print between his fingers, happens to know copyright law like the back of his hand, and likes to stand up for the little guy.  Not sure why those details are important : ).

But even if not lawyer, any advise on how to encourage final payment from clients would be appreciated too.

TL: DR;  Record label ain't paying, I am trying to get creative way to make them want to.   

EDIT: Thanks all for the Advise!  After talking to a Lawyer, I think the best course of action I really have is to keep playing nice and trying to get them to pay through gentle persuasion.   The money is both big for me, and to much to file in small claims,  and to small to make it worth someone else getting involved. 

This company is a huge conglomerate, and I gain many of my jobs through another division of this company.  So going to war, or playing hardball, seems will only hurt my other work there.  I did ""accidentally let it slip"" to one of the heads of another department that usually has my back about the situation I was in.   So hoping that they are able to put some internal pressure on it.  Anyway,  Thanks for the support, kind words and Advice!  No go create some amazing music and call me to make a video for you!

Tiny little gig, but pretty important for the band. Hired a couple of subs and a few monitors in but the main rig stayed the same i.e. about 2k of FOH rig. Not a lot, but enough for this size of venue. 

Soundcheck all went great, all sounded great, everybody happy.

The band are stoked, the house is packed with industry bods. 

But... the stupid fucking club owner thought she could smell burning, had decided to flip out the breakers to the PA and hadn't told anyone about it ( this is about a minute before the band go on and everything had been working up until this point )  

Sooo, the band jump on stage for the first song to a great response from a packed house, kick into their first song and... absolutely no main speakers, everything was coming from the monitors on stage and my subs. Nightmare. It sounded worse than dreadful. 

I ran over the the bar and I'm like WTF, there's no power to the PA??

This stupid cows response ( she was Italian ) ""I turn the speakers off as I smell burning"" So I'm like: Well turn them back on again, the  band are bloody playing?

Her: I can't do that, I smell burning. 

Me: What the fuck do you mean you can't do that, the band can't play without any main speakers??

Her: Well they can just play, or I turn everything off and you go home. 

Of course the band can't hear this as they're behind the rig so they just keep playing and by this point I've got the management people hassling me over the obvious i.e. it sounds fucking shit. 

Anyway I've lost it with this stupid bitch and I'm threatening to jump over the bar and flip the damn breakers myself just to get some power. 

She's like: I can smell the burning, this is the best I can do.  

Me: Well if you can still smell the burning then it's obviously not the damn speakers, TURN THE PA ON PLEASE, THERE'S A FUCKING BAND PLAYING IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, A BAND THAT HAVE BOOKED OUT THE WHOLE VENUE FOR THIS ONE EVENT!!??

Her: I don't care about band, why do I care about band? 

Me: Fuckin, fuckin.... argghhh you stupid cow!!

I swear to gawd some people are just born stupid. 

The management have cottoned on to what's happening at this point and they're now screaming at her too. So eventually after four songs, a lot of protesting and whole load of F'ing and blinding the PA gets turned back on. 

I mean just...

We pulled it off by the skin of our teeth for the last three songs, but still, WTF is wrong with people? 

To be honest though the moral of this story is: No matter how professional you become in this industry, there is always someone who'll do something so ridiculous that it screw you right over and you're left helpless.  

Oh and the burning, one of her own barman had been smoking out the back and left the door open. 

I'll get my coat.

Second: super cheap USB key breaks - just from being plugged in a few dozen times.

Third: in order to keep working, you have to first purchase a $30+tax Zero Downtime service (it's heavily promoted on their site - so the whole commonly-failing-hardware thing is not only known, it's a big part of the company's earning strategy).  This gives you access to a TEMPORARY, two week license.

Fourth: you must purchase a new, similar-quality, $50 iLok

Fifth: you must mail your old iLok back to PACE (iLok's shitty parent company) and pay $50 for them to ALLOW you access to your permanent ProTools license on the new iLok you bought.  This can take many weeks, even though your temporary license only lasts for two.

Did I forget to mention that ""Zero Downtime"" service is charged ANNUALLY, automatically?

Shame on Avid for allowing this absolute scam to monopolize their licensing system.  To be honest, if I could go back in time and choose a different DAW, I would.

If anyone out there is considering going with ProTools or other Avid products - please consider that you're also hitching your wagon to iLok. PLEASE AVOID. /rant

Edit: anger-grammar

The methods behind critiquing food and music aren't that terribly dissimilar -- ""Well, I thought the track had its strong points; your bass was punchy and compelling, and the percussive elements drove it forward, but I thought your lead synth was overly-compressed and void of velocity-based dynamics, and while the master EQing wasn't bad, the mix lacked space and fullness overall."" Get a handful of old-hat producers on the judging panel, like Tiesto or Paul van Dyk or Liam Howlett or whomever, along with appropriate challenge-specific cameos. 

Shit, just think about how many chef-based reality shows are out there. Ace of Cakes, Top Chef, Chopped, Next Food Network Star... 

Throwing drum'n'bass, hip-hop, house, trance, and dance producers into widely-varying challenges like that would be a lot of fun to watch. I think so, anyway. I hope I'm not alone."	t5_2qmah	True

How do we get to this state without going to sleep so we can write this way and record these ideas?	thisisbray	208	40	136	"Frequently, I have lucid dreams in which I am writing songs and they are truly beautiful, perfect songs. I awake and they linger for just a second and then they're gone, I can't hold on to them. Last night, I lost one that felt like one of the best. I retained only the final words to the chorus and it's really depressing. I've dreamt symphonies before and I frequently dream completed folk/singer-songwritery songs that are just beautiful and I can't hold on to that lucid state.

Any of you experience this? Jon Brion has spent years honing the ability to instantly articulate what's in his mind musically, exercises I've been trying as well. Flying Lotus talks about altered states and lucidity and astral projections and things like that. How do we get to these states where music is truly flowing without inhibition? I can get to it improvisationally on guitar or saxophone but in terms of writing a song, it only happens in my dreams and it's very sad; very rarely can I get there while I'm awake. I know this music's in there somewhere and I've written many great songs in spite of this, but the best in me are buried deep down.

Thoughts...

EDIT: While doing drugs to get to certain states is fine, it's not necessarily sustainable and I'd appreciate some advice that doesn't rely on chemically inducing an altered state.

Over the past two years, I have gathered [inspiration](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ednsu/interview_with_james_mercer_of_lcd_soundsystem/), [advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/dk4ah/listen_bedroom_musician_craves_constructive/) and [no-holds-barred criticism](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/gic1x/analysis_of_a_work_in_progress_with_sound_samples/) from /r/wearethemusicmakers but I have never given back, barring a comment here and there.  [One of them even got best of'd](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/z81cz/docjesus_provides_insight_that_all_early_music/).  That was really kind of /u/TheGraham .

Anyway, over the past year or so I've experienced something of a spiritual rebirth regarding my attitude towards music, and I thought I'd share.  If you disagree, or my advice isn't relevant to you, that's fine.  It doesn't apply to everyone, only myself and hopefully a few others.

* **Your technical skill is of the utmost importance.**  I used to think technical skill was for the virtuosos, and everyone else simply had to concern themselves with self-expression.  **Bullshit**.  I'll paraphrasing Billy Corgan here, but your technical ability should never get in the way of your self-expression.  If you find yourself struggling for something to play to express a feeling, you don't know enough about your instrument.  There were people mastering the guitar, or the drum machine, or the sampler, or the synth, or the piano, or the voice *long before you*.  What I'm saying here is that you're complaining level 3 is too difficult when other people struggled with level 20.

* **Learn to communicate.** When I was 18 or 19, I was trying to pull a typical rock band together.  I'd found myself a guitarist/singer who had some talent - his voice was more pleasant than mine to listen to, at least.  I was the bass player, but I was in charge, and I'd written the songs.  ""Play an Eb chord here"", I said.  ""Uh, I don't know what that is,"" he replied.  ""I have my own style, and I just play whatever.""  He's a nice guy, but these are the words of a scared fool who doesn't know what they're doing.  It's not difficult to learn the basics of theory for your instrument.  Take the plunge, and you'll find yourself with less problems in the practice room.  Music theory isn't the final word, but it's a ""lingua franca"", a language that allows people to meet halfway and communicate.

* **Your lyrics matter more than you think.**  If you're involved in every aspect of a song's production, it's very easy to get caught up in the musical side of things.  But do your lyrics speak to people?  Are you tapping into something that people *feel*?  When I spent far too much time on MSN Messenger in the late 90s, people would use lyrics from songs as their username.  Maybe you think that's lame - I do too!  But they didn't pick that song lyric because they had horrible taste - *they picked it because they thought it was great and it expressed a part of their humanity they couldn't express in their own words.*

* **Feel matters more than specifics.**  This ties in with ""less is more"".  You can make the most overdone chord progressions sound meaningful.  Take The White Stripes as an example.  They weren't doing anything particularly special, nor were they the most technically skilled musicians, but they had the *feel*.  If you don't think your inner self can be expressed sufficiently with standard chord progressions, that's totally fine.  But remember that some things work for a reason, and that what differentiates these songs is the *feel*.  That's what people grab onto, what keeps them thinking or dancing or feeling or singing or clapping along.  A great actor can still move you with crappy dialogue.  The greatest things happen when a great actor has great dialogue.


* **Don't underestimate the 'sound'.**  This is more important than ever in our digital age.  How instruments 'sound' is *so* important.  If you're using stock VSTs and presets, don't expect people to be excited by your sound.  The 'sound' of your recording is as much of an expression of you as the composition is.

* **Find the spaces.**  There is only enough room for, at most, two instruments at once.  If every other part is keeping it simple, one instrument can shine through.  If one track is playing a melodic part, everything else should be holding back in response.  If that isn't enough, your one melodic track isn't compelling.  Fight the compulsion to force other voices to compensate.

* **Less is more.**  You hear people saying this all the time, but when I was a teenager, I didn't fully understand it.  I was always pushing for more, more tracks, more voices.  I'd need vocal harmonies, a bass line that moved around a lot, weird chord changes and so on.  Then I'd hear something like Smog's [The Well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8VLdOGtG1g) and wonder how the hell he managed to make such a repetitive song so utterly compelling.  Think of it this way:  if you can make the simplest of songs sound brilliant using only your voice and your instrument of choice, everything else will follow.  **If something doesn't sound intriguing by itself, it's easy to cover it up with more tracks**.  Think about it.  Are you trying to improve the song, or are you trying to cover up the fact that the song is kinda boring?  Or worse, are you *trying to prove how clever you are by throwing more parts on the song*?


That may have been a rambling diatribe.  If it was, I apologise.  I hope it may have been some use to a few out there.  I write about video games and music and anxiety on [my blog](http://www.thewretchedryanenglish.com) and if you like video games, please join us on my subreddit at /r/truegaming.

Now, let's be honest - there are *a lot* of under par tracks that are dished out on a weekly basis... We're *all* guilty of this kind of material, whether you want to believe it or not... nobody starts out as an amazing musician without the occasional hiccup in their timeline (personally, my current hiccup has lasted 4 months)... I, myself have taken heed of the community over time (as well as channelling my own experiences in what I would like to get out of this subreddit) and seek to only publish what I believe to be tracks worthy of feedback from such an amazingly varied community.    
My main gripe (and the topic at hand) is that I see a lot of under-par behaviour being projected on to the forums. What I'm trying to say is, please don't be a douche. Slander is the least constructive form of feedback and really offers no help whatsoever to the contributing artist, nor the community as a whole.    
I'm not telling you to listen to *every single submission* and in turn, write several paragraphs on each one, conveying your feelings on the piece. I'm simply asking you to remember that artists generally put a lot of time into producing tracks and to have someone dismiss your entry with a thoughtless and snide four word comment is insulting to not only your own intelligence but to the very code of rediquette and mature conduct in general. I **hate** to see comments the likes of Xbox Live chat lobbies spilling out into WATMM, not cool bro.    

To establish my point clearly - If you're going to critique somebody's work, use your brains and make it count (whether your feedback be negative *or* positive).    
If you begin to feel a rising urge to be a 'You = Shit musician, Stop producing', kind of douche, just **please** be a bigger person, grow up and move on. Applying this kind of behaviour will aid in the restoration of a once incredible community for the sharing and discussion of aural material.

1370031716.0	1ffbd2	How to acoustically treat your studio or workspace: Monitors, Modes, and Materials (x-post from r/audioengineering)	chillsun	191	20	11	"Hi Guys,

I keep seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head on this subreddit and /r/audioengineering . I am making this post in hopes that I and others in the community that have knowledge and experience in this important aspect of recording can impart some of it to those that don't have as much knowledge or experience. I am also hoping this can get added to the sidebar so we can stop seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head. Note, these are the very basics. I truly hope we can begin a more in depth discussion about the kinds of room modes and the cheapest ways to achieve great results! Let's begin.

So you want to make recordings? Maybe you already have made one. Maybe you have made a couple and some of them sound great, but others don't match up to the same quality and you want to problem solve your sonic issues. Regardless of the stage you are at in your new found addiction, if you haven't yet started, you should begin to think about how you monitor your sound. That is, how sound gets from your monitors/speakers to your ears. First, you will need a ""trustworthy"" set of monitors if you don't have any. I put trustworthy in quotes because it doesn't ""matter"" what you buy. I put matter in quotes because it only matters what you buy as your ears become attuned to certain subtle sonic characteristics in music. Buy monitors with the best qualities you like that you can afford. Personally, I use Yamaha HS80Ms and have for years. I picked the HS80s some 5 years ago for a few reasons. The first was that they look like NS10s (rad!). The second, to my lesser-trained ears 5 years ago, those monitors sounded pristine compared to other options. Did I mention I got a crazy discount on them at the time? Oh, and they have a really consistent low end without needing a sub-woofer. This was just my untrained opinion, though, so don't go bashing me if you go out and buy them only to hate how they sound. Pick what you like and run with it. 

You have monitors. You are most likely in an apartment, house, bedroom, or some combination of those three things. Maybe you are in a project studio in the G ""room"" that hardly passes for a drum booth. If you are the last option, I hate to say it, but you need a larger space. You can try to make small spaces work, but you really need at least a 10x10 room to dedicated completely to this. Room dimensions you say? Now is a good time to check out these ratios of ""ideal"" room ratios. Also, grab a tape measure and measure your room. Write it down, dummy.

**Height**:**Width**:**Length**

**1.00**:**1.14**:**1.39**

**1.00**:**1.28**:**1.54**

**1.00**:**1.60**:**2.33**



courtesy of Ethan Winer http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html

If you have a room that falls into this ratio, hooray great for you! If you don't, hooray great for you! My room didn't fall perfectly into any of these, but it comes closest to the second. The dimensions of my apartment bedroom studio are 8'x10'x13'. Why does this matter? Modes!

Room modes, or the frequency at which a room resonates, are the reason sound (especially low frequencies) is perceived louder or quieter in different locations in a room. In an ideal studio, as long as the listener places their ears anywhere in front of the monitors they will hear essentially every frequency at equal volumes. Your mileage may vary. In apartment bedroom studios it is close to impossible to get rid of all of your room modes. Why? Something something parallel walls, square dimensions, sheet rock. What we can do is tailor a specific area that sounds accurate and depending on how well you do this your area can grow quite large! So how exactly does a room mode get created? As you know, all things resonate at a fundamental frequency, even you. Rooms are no different and the size of your room is actually part of a wave form. If you have your audio unit converter handy, convert 16' into hertz. You should get close to 70hz. That means 70hz takes 16' to go from 0 to +1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0. That is, through it's whole cycle. My apartment bedroom studio is 8' tall which is half of 16' and 70hz is also a mode of my room. Let's break this down:

Waveforms have the most energy when they are changing polarity. That is, when the wave makes the switch from 1 to -1 through 0 or vice versa. The wave uses all of that energy to get to ±1 and when it reaches that point it is out of energy and falls back to 0. My ceiling and floor are essentially taking any sonic information traveling at 70hz and bouncing it between the two surfaces because the two surfaces are at distance from each other that intersects with 70hz's most energetic position. The two surfaces *resonate* at 70hz. You could see them vibrate if you were stoned enough. This is how two drum heads work. Only, instead of striking the batter side of a drum, speakers are striking the walls through convection of air.

You can calculate your room modes here. http://www.bobgolds.com/Mode/RoomModes.htm

If you calculated your room modes you will notice that all of the frequencies fall in a pattern. Halves and doubles, baby! Not only do I have to worry about 70hz, I have to worry about 140, 280, 560, and possibly even 1120. (You know I did, playboy.) Mind you, this is just for the height of my room! You might be thinking of quitting now, but don't, it get's *way* better if you learn the rest of your room modes and start forming a plan.

You know what your room modes are, but you don't know how to fix them. Hmmm? Who's to say those modes are even a problem? I've read literature that suggests vocalists have a harder time singing in dead rooms than rooms with a little bit of ""verb"". It has something to do with being able to monitor the sound of your own voice. Ohhhh, take note of how your ears are always the same distance from the floor. Some ""verb"" can be good. Let's stop saying verb. What I mean to say is, some reflections can be good. 

Reflections, there is a new word for your vocabulary. Reflections are when a wave hits a surface and bounces from it in the opposite direction. Reflectors reflect energy. The opposite of reflectors are absorbers. Absorbers absorb energy. Reflections are tricky, though, because the word itself says nothing of the direction of the reflected wave which is important if we're trying to direct excess frequencies away from our ears. There is a specific class of reflectors called diffusers that cause reflections to splay out in lots of random directions instead of one consistently unknown location. As far diffusers go, the beauty is in the curved surface that reflects in infinitely random directions. I have some reflectors in place to balance the color of my room. All rooms will need a balance of all materials. Some things in your room can be used as reflectors. Flat walls are reflectors. I use a combination of strategically placed absorbers and the existing walls to achieve my most accurate results.

Ok, so how do we go about determining where to put absorbers, reflectors, and/or diffusers? With mirrors. I used a handheld mirror with a hole in the handle just small enough for a push pin to pin the mirror to the wall. I pinned the mirror to the wall, sat in my chair, and looked to see if I could see any portion of my speaker in it. If I could see the woofer I made a mark of it on the wall. If I could see the tweeter, I made that mark, too. I went all the way around the room except for behind the monitors where I knew I would be placing a broadband absorber. I have also made a large effort to pull the monitors off of the wall. Walls have a nasty proximity effect, if your ears or your monitors sit too close to them you will notice. In the end I ended up putting one absorber behind each monitor hanging vertically, two hanging horizontally in the back of the room one stacked* on the other. This is where the room mode knowledge came in handy. 

I decided to setup up my room with the longest wall in front of me, this is actually backwards (something something shortest distance from ears to wall), but the short walls in question are a closet and a window and the closet side has a door next to it. Logistically, it would not work if I wanted to work in the room. Ok, modes, my ""front to back"" mode is 55hz. Yikes! The complimentary frequency spread includes lots of low frequencies. I went super hard on broadband absorbers and stuffed my acoustic panels with rock wool. Rock wool and acoustic fiberglass will absorb frequencies as low as 125hz. Fun fact, HS80Ms aren't behemoths when it comes to producing 85hz and under so I don't have to worry ""much"" about that. I have easily 4"" of rock wool in my front and back panels and it cleans up that room mode nicely. For those pesky short walls I ended up putting a bookshelf stocked with heavy books, vinyl, and cables on the window side and free standing broadband absorbers on the closet side. I also hung curtains (on the rare occasion I want a brighter sound in the room I draw the curtains to reveal shiny plastic sliding closet doors). The main idea here is I wanted to put as much mass as I could between the speakers where they reflect off the wall and the walls. I don't have any figures to back this up, but I'm pretty sure my stuffed bookshelf is a ""bass trap"" for anything below 100hz. I haven't mentioned yet that all four corners (save for the one with the door) are protected by thick broadband absorbers (more traps, low frequencies pools where planes meet). One corner is occupied by a gigantic square armchair (another bass trap, opposite the bookshelf) that isn't for sitting. The ceiling corners are all covered with broadband absorbers. Finally, the space right above my head in the ""zone"" is covered. It should be noted that all of these baffles are floating a distance from the surfaces they protect. I was able to get the ceiling panels really low hanging as well as the ones on the back wall. I aimed to float my panels from the wall at the problem frequency's quarter length where it has the least amount of energy. The result is a room that sounds a lot like it does in my car. I don't worry about how my own mixes sound on other systems anymore and I've grown to love some of my favorite albums even more! Classical on vinyl? You might stop leaving the home.

I want to double back to that thing I said about your ears distance from the floor. This fact is why studios with hardwood floors sound so nice. For my studio I went out and bought one of those hard plastic office mat rollers. It makes a world of difference.

**Don't let stacked hanging panels touch. The one on the bottom will fall.***

**TL;DR**

Ok, so how do we make a broadband absorber? It's so easy, dude. Just go to the following link.

Fogel contacted my friends band to book a show with them, they accepted and found a date that worked for Sullivan Hall.  The bill ended up with my friends band on first at 8pm on a Saturday night.  My friends took the stage at 8:05 with about 10 people there, and as the rest of the band started the first song, Fogel harassed the lead singer about the turnout.  She declined to engage as the show had already begun, but later in the set she explained to the crowd what happened while thanking us for being supportive.  The band left immediately with no discussion, and no money.

Apparently the ""deal"" was my friends band bring 35 people, but nothing was signed and no real money was agreed upon either.  I've been to many of their shows, and they always draw more than 40, and they promoted as normal but ended up with a light crowd. I am close to these people, and know the other fans, I do not know the exact count, but it was at least 18, and I personally left with 10 friends.  I knew every single person in attendance by name, with means that he brought: 0 people. 

More importantly, the following day Fogel went on to the facebook Fan Page for said band and complained, in a thread thanking everyone for coming, complaining that only 8 people came when he specified that 35 people must come.


What does a promoter do if they don't bring people to a show?  We all have off nights, but this guy has a reputation for this, so I'm guessing this isn't his first.  I'd steer clear of this guy when booking shows, especially since the venue will easily book you directly and not take more of your money.

We've all put in our hard earned money from our day jobs to buy the equipment we need to write and record the music we love. Long story short, we just got signed to a pretty well respected indie label, but one that doesn't offer much more than distrobution, promotion, and sync lisence negotations on our behealf with various studios. We have been really been trying to support our music by playing live as much as possible, and we've been working furiously to gear up to record our 3rd record. Last night, some asshole broke into our keyboard players car and stole our keyboards, pedals, and our custom made P. Ellis drumset. We're talking like $5,000 dollars worth of shit. We didn't even bring home more than $150.00 last year from our music being distributed through various outlets/sync deals, so the band can't sustain itself really, and most of us have day jobs that pay just enough to pay our personal bills.

Needless to say this is pretty crippling. I know this happens to tons of bands, but I doubt anyone gives a shit enough about our music to throw any money our way (though we've been thinking about giving it a shot). Other than beggining people to give us $5.00 on Indiegogo, what other alternatives do we have to recoup the equipment? HALP

TL;DR: We got tons of our stuff stolen and we need advice on how to get it back.

UPDATE: Police report has been filed. Insurance won't do anything. Serial numbers were never recorded for the equipment, so we couldnt provide the cops with anything really. I guess we just never thought about this sort of thing. The P. Ellis Drums and custom pedal don't even have serial numbers to be honest with you. Some friends of ours have been spreading the word on Facebook and Twitter and such. We're just going to have to swallow our pride and ask people if they would be willing to help out. Thanks to all for your recommendations. This was a learning experience for sure, and I hope we recoup from it. I'll update with any new developments.

UPDATE #2: I've had a few requests for links to our music. My apologies, I didn't wanna shamelessly plug my band while looking for legitimate advice. But here you go:

Link to our EPK - http://www.deepelm.com/bands/index_again.html
Link to stream our latest release - http://www.deepelm.com/sum/540_sum.html

EDIT #4: WE GOT THE DRUMS BACK. The asshat that stole then was trying to sell them at a garage sale. Someone bought them and was checking out the P. Ellis website when he noticed that P. Ellis Drums had put out an amber alert on the set. The guy called P. Ellis and told him that he had bought the drums and fully cooperated in getting the drums back to us and giving the cops the address to the house that the garage sale was at. He confirmed that the keys, amp, and pedals were all at the same garage sale. The police are working with us to pay a little visit to the house that held the garage sale!

1343447946.0	xa8rx	I'm an electronic music producer (EDM, electro house, game score type stuff, etc) who has a music degree and grew up classically trained.  All you producers out there, take some time this weekend and listen to some classical music. Even for 5 minutes, no distractions, just do it.	ZuluCompany	229	63	99	"This isn't supposed to be some elitist post by any means, but I'm sitting here at midnight, after a full day or producing a few different tracks, some heavier than others, all EDM. I'm now listening to a great CD of Debussy piano recordings and I feel like I'm ready to start producing again.  

Keep in my mind my musical tastes are all over the place.  Honestly.  I grew up on piano with classical music, discovered punk around 11-12 years old, then metal/hardcore around 15, then jazz/classical guitar/world music at around 18-19 years old and then dance music, EDM, and all variances of electronic music from 21 and up.  I'm also leaving out hip hop, celtic music of various sorts, and a bunch of other sub types of music.

Classical music is the history of music for the past few hundred years, depending on who you talk to.  It's easy to get caught up in the current trends, the current technologies and the current compositional/production styles.  All it takes is a few notes of Debussy, or Mozart or even Wagner if that's your thing, to remind you where this is all coming from.  For example, i'm listening to Debussy on piano, and the compositions are blowing my mind each time I hear them, the textures, the fluidity of motion between all the different voices and lines of melody......all done on one instrument, by a single man, who had naught but pen, paper and his piano to create it. 

So let's take a step back from out computers, recorders and sequencers and describe our favorite classical, medieval, renaissance, or other traditional/worldly music to invigorate our aural synapses. 

My current favorites (going through a piano fix) are:

[Debussy - Arabesque #1 in E Minor L 66](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UMAEYbQnjE)
[Debussy - La cathedrale engloutie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfSBddhFvyA)

some thoughts about putting together a band.  Here's my shot. 
Quinn  
 
		On Leading, Having or Being in a Band
				By Quinn Martin
					6-6-11
 
All the following should be followed to the letter, unless it doesn't
feel right.  In that case, go with your heart.
 
						I.
	HAVE A VISION. BE POLITE.  BE PERSISTENT.
 
 
		For an Audience there are two kinds of music.  Music
they know and music they don't.   Decide what you are gonna play to
them. 
		Your style is based on limitations (artificial,
technical, economic, etc.) .   
		What you don't play defines who you are. 
		Musicians listen with their ears.  Audiences listen with
their eyes. 
		Bands are organic living things.  Relationships on large
scale.  The members need to give and take to achieve the goal. 
 
						II.
				WHY HAVE A BAND?
 
		There needs to be a point, a goal, to the effort.
Succesful bands have had points as varied as:   
				Women (John Lennon said the Beatles were
started to get chicks).
				Politics (Rage Against the Machine)
				Money (The Eagles)
				Personal Glory (Lady Gaga)
				Art/Expression (Dylan)
				Avoid Hoeing Cotton (Buck Owens)
				Fun (Early Red Hot Chili Peppers)
				To have a team/companionship of group
 
		The point can change, but it changes the band.  Early
Sha Na Na was an intellectual protest.  Later it was a party nostalgia
band.
  		Know your point and work to make it. 
		Dreams shared can be dreams realized.  If you want to
play a blazing lead in a  stadium to 80,000 people.  Lay it out there.
The journey is the thing but there is no journey without a destination. 
 
					III.
				LEADERS
 
	All bands have leaders.  Two types of bands are: 
 
A: Leaderless Democratic Friend oriented Jam Bands.   These bands
actually have leaders they are just hidden. 
        Things are done by consensus, take a long time to decide, and
break up easily.   Advantage is that all members are committed to the
group.  This is how most beginners start. 
 
B:   Bandleader with Sidemen.   More ""professional"" but less  about
group collaboration.  Sidemen move around.  The vision is with the
""leader"".   
 
	Leaders lead by example.  People will follow if you are sincere,
specific, and certain.    Leaders are willing to fail and accept
responsibility for it.   Leaders share credit. 
	The leader doesn't necessarily set the goal.  He just takes the
group towards it. 
 
 
 
					IV. 
			BAND MEMBERS
 
There are several ways to look at building a succesful group/team/band.
Here are two.
 
		A:   A band is a body.  To be a functioning body you
need 1: Head
		2: Heart
		3: Hands
		4: Feet
The Beatles: 1: John, 2: Paul, 3: George, 4. Ringo.
	John was an artist and intellectual.  Paul a heart throb and the
emotional center.   Each individually great but together, much more
powerful. 
 
		B: This is my own theory of a band.   You need to have
these positions covered: 
	1: A Musician
	2: An Artist
	3: A Front Man/ Visual Focus	
	4: An Enthusiast
	5: A Promoter/Water Carrier
 
It is possible to have one person cover more than one position.   It is
possible to have people share a position. 
	1: A successful band really only needs one good musician.  The
more ""musicians"" the more fight for sonic space.  
	2: Artist: the guy with the vision.  The writer.  Think David
Byrne from the Talking Heads. 
	3: Front: See Roger Daltrey from the Who.
	4: Enthusiast: Paul MacArtney in the early Beatles wanted to
play wanted to progress.
	5: Water Carrier:   Charlie Watts from the Stones. Max Weinberg
for Bruce Springsteen.   Keeps it going.	 
 
					V.
			Choosing Band Members
 
A: Chemistry:   This is the key to greatness.  It's the combination.
Take out one ingredient and it don't work anymore.   See REM without
Bill Berry (the drummer). 
Music is funny.  You can play really well with people you have nothing
in common with and not be able to play at all with your best friends.
Chemistry is the magic.   You can't force it.  If you find it all you
can do is try to make it possible to continue it.  
B: Commitment: 
	Bands usually last a couple years.  People move on, change, have
babies, etc.  As Del Paxton said, ""Bands come and Go.  Players play.""
	The bands that are friends stay together longer, cause they are
committed to each other.   
C: Bonding:   
	Any team or Band has a moment when they bond, either eating
breakfast, waiting for a show, playing, something that makes them a
distinct unit.   That can be artificially induced but the natural
bonding of doing something as a group, sacrificing for the group will
occur over time. 
D: Successful people are better in a band than great musicians.   People
who can commit to a goal and work towards it.   Better to get a bass
player who likes the idea/vision of the band and is a successful tennis
player or  4.0 academic than to get a seriously good bass player who is
just lookin' for a paycheck.   
     The tennis player can get better and will commit to the goal and
work at it. 
 
					VI.
				Equipment
 
(HE WHO OWNS THE PA, IS ALWAYS IN THE BAND)
	The point of playing for an audience is for them to hear you.
In order to do that you need equipment. 
	A list of stuff you need.  
						Instruments (including
Rhythym Instruments)
						Microphones	
						Cords (extension, mike,
instrument)
						Amplifiers
						PA
						Speakers
 
						Lights (2 or 3 clamp
lights min.)
 
Optional gear.  Power Amp, Compressor for Vocals. 
T-shirts.
 
 
					VII.
		THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN BAND MEMBERS
 
Positive:   
		1: History of Success in Life (Graduated College, Played
College ball, Business owner)
		2: Good people skills, get along with various kinds of
people.
		3: Able to commit and work on a goal.  (Shows up for
practice.  Has a car, a place to live... a reasonable life outside the
band)
		4: Willingness to learn and try different things.  Full
teacup thing. 
		5: Willingness to sweat. (Metaphorically and physically)
		6: Willing to move while playing.  Schtick is important.
		7: Willing to switch instruments. Changes the sound
without adding new personnel.
		8: Willing to communicate. 
 
Negative: 
		A.  Won't help load in/out. 
		B.  Get's to loaded to play.
		C.  Negativity ( ""You can't sing.   That's not the way
it's played on the record.  They suck.  We could never play there.""
		D.  Borrowing money.
		E.  No car. Needs ride all the time.
		F.  ""Star"" who won't listen to the other people while
he's playing.  Won't ever quit playing. 
 
 
 
				VII.
		       Aphorisms/Dichos
 
1.  I never make mistakes.  I play jazz sometime. 
2.  If you make a mistake, do it again and they'll think you are a
genius. 
3.  To excuse oneself is to accuse oneself.   
4.  Never Apologize to the Audience.
5.  The song is not over till the drummer stops playing.
6.  Always end a set with a Monkee's song.
7.  Sweet Potatoes are a good thing. 
8. If great things are not attempted, great things are not done. 
9.  To be free of conformity is not to spurn it, rather, It is to not be
deceived by it. 
10.  Audiences Listen with their eyes. 
11.  An Audience would rather see someone have fun, than hear someone
play brilliantly. 
12.  They pay you to sell beer, not create art. 
13. Resist the temptation to put it in the middle. 
14.  Loud is only Loud in comparison to Soft.
15.  Fast is only Fast in comparison to slow.
16.  A beat is a note, regularly interrupted by silence. 
17.  Art is leaving out stuff.   But you have to know it is there before
you can leave it out. 
18.   Be willing to dress up.  The band should be dressed better (or
more interestingly)  than the audience.
19.  A band is never better than it's rhythym. 
20. The song goes wrong when it's goes to far from the dance. 
21.  No wind blows in favor of a ship with no port of destination. 
 
 
 
 
					IX.
				Sonic Territory
 
Theoretical split:   Drums should play 90% of the time.
				 Bass should play 80% of the time.  
				 Vocals.... 50% of the time
				 Rhythym Guitar.... 50% of the time
				 Lead Guitar... 30% of the time. 
 
 
					X. 
				Communication
 
Work out some way of communicating with the entire band.  Facebook,
phonetree (I call Greg, Greg calls Mark, Mark calls Steve),    E-mail.
Something.  Bands require organization and organizations require
communication. Lack of communication results in frustration and
frustration kills the band.

Isn't anyone interested in making songs with movement and *hooks*? Where are the hooks?  
I mean I know it's sucks to waste 3 seperate melodies on *one* song when you could make 3 songs out of them. But that one song could be 3x as good!

 Anyway, I don't mean to be inflammatory, this is just what always goes through my head when I'm scrubbing through songs on soundcloud. I know it's totally subjective and that many people love listening to thrumming protracted electronic music.

We are trying out some new stuff with a programmed midi keyboard hooked up to Ableton Live, and we've practiced it a million times. My bassist plays the keyboard. 

During the gig at the start of a song using the keyboard, the keyboard didn't respond. A few seconds of panic and my bassist grabbed his bass and we played the song with me, on the guitar, playing some of the keyboard lines and my bassist playing the bass throughout the whole song - never rehearsed. No one noticed and the crowd loved the song.

I just want to show my appreciation for the musical genius of my bassist, who wrote the song, being able to grab the bass mid-concert and performing like the pro he is.

I also love to know, that we have practiced so much, that we can shift roles during a concert and still amaze the crowd. Lovely!"	t5_2qmah	True

What to do?	bipscale	181	26	56	"May 2011: my band (electro-rock duo) posted an ad on craigslist looking for a singer.  Several people were interested, and one dude in particular sang on an unmixed version of one of our best tracks.  We weren't interested.  He sent a friendly email indicating that he was going to use his version with his vocals to send to label reps to show his skills, and that he'd give us full credit.  There was no mention of an actual release.  That was the last I heard from him.  

Fast forward to today: We've decided to keep the track instrumental and are going into the studio to master.  I'm checking my old emails to find some files, and I run into craigslist dude's message.  On a whim I google his name + song title, and the full first page of google results are our song with his vocals on top of it.  It's for sale on Amazon and iTunes, it's posted on Billboard.com, myxer.com, lyrics.com, and it's on two compilations on Spotify.  No mention of my band at all.

Considering that we plan to release this track some time in the next couple months: how do we begin to address this?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice!!!  We haven't taken action yet, but I know I have learned a few things today, namely to REGISTER a copyright before sharing songs with anyone (see http://www.copyright.gov/eco/ - thanks samferrara).  I will follow up when something happens.  I promise."	t5_2qmah	True

1343946014.0	xl6b8	How to: Play the blues	OneCello	210	61	67	"1. Most Blues begin, ""Woke up this morning...""

2. ""I got a good woman"" is a bad way to begin the Blues,  unless you stick something nasty in the next line like,  ""I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town.""

3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right, repeat it. Then find something that rhymes...sort of like:

""Got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Yes, I got a good woman with the meanest face in town.  Got teeth like  Margaret Thatcher, And she weighs 500 pounds.""

4. The Blues is not about choice. You're stuck in a ditch, you're stuck in a ditch - ain't no way out.

5. Blues cars: Chevys, Fords, Cadillacs and broken-down trucks. Blues don't travel in Volvos, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train, blues NEVER go on the northbound train. Jet aircraft and state-sponsored motor pools ain't even in the running! .

Walkin' plays a major part in the blues lifestyle.  So does fixin' to die.

6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues, ""adulthood"" means being old enough to get the electric chair if you shoot a man in Memphis.

7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just clinical depression. Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City are still the best places to have the Blues. You cannot have the blues in any place that don't get rain.

8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg 'cause an alligator be chomping on it is.

9. You can't have no Blues in an office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

10. Good places for the Blues:

    a. highway

    b. jailhouse

Bad places for the Blues:

    a. Nordstrom

    b. gallery openings

    c. Ivy League institutions

    d. golf courses

11. No one will believe it's the Blues if you wear a suit,  'less you happen to be an old person, and you slept in it for the last 6 months.

12. Do you have the right to sing the Blues? Yes, if:

     a. you're older than dirt

     b. you're blind

     c. you shot a man in Memphis

Not if:

     a. you have all your teeth

     b. you were once blind but now can see

     c. the man in Memphis lived

     d. you have a 401K or trust fund

13. Blues is not a matter of color. It's a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Sonny Liston could. Ugly white people also got leg up on the blues.

14. If you ask for water and your darlin' give you gasoline, it's the Blues.  Other acceptable Blues beverages are:

     a. muddy water

     b. nasty black coffee

The following are NOT Blues beverages:

     a. Perrier

     b. Chardonnay

     c. Snapple

     d. Slim Fast

15. If death occurs in a cheap motel or a shotgun shack,  it's a Blues death.  Stabbed in the back by a jealous lover is another Blues way to die. So is the electric chair, substance abuse and dying lonely on a broken down cot. You can't have a Blues death if you die during a tennis match or while getting liposuction. 

16. Some Blues names for women:

     a. Sadie

     b. Big Mama

     c. Bessie

     d. Fat River Dumpling

17. Some Blues names for men:

     a. Joe

     b. Willie

     c. Little Willie

     d. Big Willie

18. Persons with names like Michelle, Amber, Debbie, and Heather can't sing the Blues no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.

19. ""Make your own Blues Name"" Starter Kit:

     a. name of physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Lame, etc.)

     b. first name (see above) plus name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Kiwi, etc.)

     c. last name of a President (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore,

        etc.)  For example: Blind Lime Jefferson, Pegleg Lemon

        Johnson or Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc. (Well, maybe not ""Kiwi.""

20. I don't care how tragic your life: if you own even ONE computer, you cannot sing the blues. "	t5_2qmah	True

I decided to take it upon myself to post a basic guide on how to do just that. 

I'm not going to hold your hand through every step, as I'm assuming if you want this music career thing to be a reality, you'll take the time to research everything I mention and make an informed decision for yourself. I'm just here to give you options.

**Who Am I?**
Why should you listen to me? Well, I run a music marketing blog based out of Nashville called [Sunshine Promotion](http://sunshinepromotion.info). For the past 4 or 5 years, I've been helping up and coming bands with budgets as small as $250 figure out how the hell to spend their money, what the next steps for their career should be, and how they can get their name out there without breaking the bank. 

**Where to put your music**
You have 2 pretty standard options, and I'd recommend sticking with either one or both of them.

*Soundcloud*: For whatever reason, the past few months have seen Soundcloud rise in popularity on music blogs. For ease of streaming and a pretty familiar interface, I highly recommend using Soundcloud as your main point of attack when sending tracks out for review, sharing new music, etc. It's not as easy to set-up links to buy your music on here, but for embedding the player, music bloggers have been giving it a lot more love than Bandcamp recently. 

*Bandcamp*: Bandcamp is the other main platform that people have been using to release music for the last few years. It's easy to get tracks up online, set prices for albums, and put merchandise (CDs, shirts, etc) up for sale within a few minutes. Soundcloud doesn't offer this. For this reason alone, I recommend new bands have both a Bandcamp and Soundcloud. One to use for sending to music bloggers and those in the press and the other for selling merchandise. 

*Your Own Website*: If you're going to take this thing seriously, you need a website. Hands down, it's the most professional thing you can do early on in your career. Emails from bands get ignored **ALL** the time because an artist doesn't have their own website setup. If you don't know how to build a website, it's time to learn. Have a friend help you. Just figure it out. When I'm looking at new bands to work with, the website is the first place I check. You need to have links to your music on here like no tomorrow and have an easily usable music player ON THE HOMEPAGE (Use your soundcloud player).

*Reverbnation*: Don't use it. I don't care if you think it has a lot of cool features. As I mentioned about the website, you're trying to give the impression of professionalism. Reverbnation is not it. It shows that you couldn't be half assed enough to spend $9/year to get your own domain name. Call me a dick, but anytime I'm sent a RN link, I ignore it.

**Planning/Getting the word out**

You need to start thinking about your album release 6 months before it actually happens. This is for a number of reasons. 

**Print press**: (magazines) works on a 3-4 month lead time, meaning that their stories have to be written months in advance. If you're thinking of trying to get coverage in these magazines with the help of a publicist, you need to contact the publicist 6 months before your album comes out and send him/her mastered copies of every track from the album. They'll pitch to print press for a few months and try and get you coverage. Publicists cost money that start up bands generally don't have. 

**Shows**: 6 months before your album comes out gives you some time to start playing shows locally and remind people of your existence, or turn them onto your music to begin with. Try to play within a 50 mile radius of your hometown in any coffee shop, bar, or street corner that will have you. If you're new, exposure is king. You'll probably hear about how you shouldn't saturate your market. If nobody knows who you are and you're playing in 2-3 cities around your hometown, this generally won't be an issue. Play weekly and make friendly with plenty of other local bands during this window of time. 

**Local Press**: This is something you can do on your own without the help of a publicist. I guarantee that there are at least 3 local newspapers and music magazines in your metropolitan area. There are probably also some music blogs, and plenty of off-kilter fan-zines that are distributed in coffee shops around town. Make an Excel spreadsheet of the contact information of every single one of them and start reaching out. About 6 months before your album is due to come out, try and invite the local press out to some of your shows, maybe 2 or 3 (don't get pushy). Introduce yourself and see if you can buy them a beer (assuming you're of age). If you don't have the balls to invite anyone from the press to your shows, find out which shows they're going to and meet them at those ones. Introduce yourself and start to make them familiar with what you do. Please don't ever underestimate the power of local press. 

**Local++ Press**: Alright, so you've got the local press on your side and have maybe even gotten an interview or a write-up about a show you played. Use this to your advantage. It's now time to start emailing bloggers/press in 100 mile radius around your city, using the same techniques as before and using the positive press you've generated as a key into their door (sorry if that sounded dirty). ""The local paper, XYZ Express, said POSITIVE PRESS QUOTE."" It doesn't matter to anyone else what you, your mom, or your bandmates think about your music. Of course you think it fucking rules. Press outlets want to know what other people think. Give them a reason to click on your links and at least give you a listen or come out to a show.

**Music Blogs**: Use hypem.com (Hype Machine) and Google Blogs to find blogs related to the type of music you play. If you take a week during your 6 month planning phase to write down the contact information of as many blogs as you can find (I generally aim to email 300-400 blogs during an album release, using positive local press as an anchor in an email). Response rates vary, but if your music is good, expect to hear back from about 5-10% of them. Remember to personalize EVERY email you send. I know it's tiring, but grab a beer and get to it. Let the blogger know you read his blog, like what he's doing, and aren't just spamming him/her and 400 other people just in hopes of getting coverage. 

**Email List**: If you've been a band for a little while already, there's a chance that you'll have an email list put together. Email your list about 1 month before the release of the album and give them a chance to preorder the record or to download a promo song or something similar. Reward existing fans for being fans and they'll remain fans for longer (Sorry for using the word ""fans"" too often). Your email list is a VERY powerful thing and if you can start emailing them about new music videos, songs, and shows in the area, you'll see better results. 

**Flyering**: I don't care what anyone says, flyering works. Is someone going to see your flyer and say ""Ooo, I should check out that band when I get home!"" No, they're not. Flyering works because the more you do it, the more people begin to think that you've actually got something going on. It works if you're persistent and don't mind flyering for every show, event, and interesting thing you have going on. 

**Branding**: Every band needs a brand. No, your flannel shirt isn't a brand. Get a logo made by one of the kids at the digital arts department at the local university or find someone online to do it for you. It'll cost you a few bucks, but having a recognizable font and logo will go miles in your marketing efforts. There's no point printing flyers with a different font every time. People recognize colors, fonts, and logos. Keep them the same for everything you do. 

**Images**: Since you've starting planning so far in advance of your album release (right?), you need to make sure you have 3 or 4 high resolution press images at your disposal. When you're emailing press, sometimes having a high res image will make or break a story about you. Images sell and everyone needs them for stories they'll be writing about you. I'm not saying you have to go out into the woods and look edgy, but what I am saying is that you need a clear picture of your face.

**Videos**: Assuming you have the money or the know-how, consider making a music video. The more events surrounding an album release (single releases, music videos, images, shows, charity events, etc), the more chances you have of emailing a press outlet and getting coverage. Music videos just give you another thing to add to your roster of content and will put you above other folks in terms of preparedness. Find an iPhone, take video of the city you live in, and make a quick lyric video. 

**Social Media**: I hope this isn't news to anyone, but please for the love of god have a functional Facebook and Twitter account. Make sure every piece of the info section is filled out on your Facebook page, you have a quality header image with tour dates, album release dates, or music video information on it, and that you have music streaming capabilities on the page. People still use Facebook to find new music, so please for the love of God make a professional looking page. Take a look at the Black Sabbath Facebook page and see what they've got going on in terms of professionalism. They have an events tab, photos, and a cohesive brand going on. They're interacting with their fans, posting good content regularly, and keeping their page up to date. There's no excuse. You're using Reddit, you surely know how to use Facebook. (Ditto goes for Twitter as well).

**Youtube**: If you manage to get a music video online, spend a bit of money and promote it in your local area. Get your name known by people in your town on Youtube and on the videos you post, mention that you have a new album coming out soon. For the artists I work with, we generally try to set up a new piece of video content every 2 weeks for about 2 months before and 2 months after an album is released. These can be covers, acoustic versions of older songs, live performances, interviews, in-studio footage, and even goofing off. The more high quality content, the better.

**Keep it local**: Yes, the internet is a vast vacuum of information and people, but at the end of the day you are where you are. Unless you have a whole lot of money to blow in the beginning, starting locally and getting your music into the local record stores, played in local coffee houses and thrift stores, played by local DJs, radio DJs, etc, is the easiest and most cost effective way to get started. Spend your money advertising on Youtube locally, printing up flyers to put in the window of any local business that will have them, printing up promo CDs with 2 or 3 of your best songs (or even teaming up with a few other local bands and making a best-of XYZ town CD) and leaving them anywhere and everywhere that will let you put them down, spending your afternoons playing anywhere and everywhere you can, and most importantly meeting people. Meet anyone you can that works at a newspaper, magazine, or venue. Make friends with every band in town, show swap, and offer to split the cost of gas. Meet music lovers and casual listeners alike and just be a generally good person to your local music scene. 

Building a fan base takes a long time and it's the bands that stick with it the longest that ultimately succeed. I'm sorry to tell you up front that there's a good chance no one will listen to your first album. That's not because it isn't good, it's because you're still building awareness. Bite the bullet and keep pushing. 

PS: There are SO many things that I'm sure I didn't cover, but I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone has and I'll edit this post with any updated information as it comes in.

TLDR: Promote successfully."	t5_2qmah	True

I was content to see the positive response to my positive response to [this thread,](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/11p1l0/aww_shit/) and I am interested in continuing to provide a dialogue here for all things PreSonus... but I don't want to come across as  salesy/spammy/obnoxious. 

In other words, while people were enthused by my response to the aforementioned thread when I posted a link to our repair service, I can begin to understand how doing this ALL THE TIME would get obnoxious and could be perceived as spammy. PreSonus does profit from repairs, after all...

Thoughts?

Obvious throwaway. 

I have a song that was written freelance for a record label, they never took it, so it's just sitting there. It's not fitting to my genre, so I'm not going to use it for my own music. 

A Solo artist in my city has just released her first track, and it's beyond terrible. Her producer is a web ""beat maker"" who specialises in making beats through his website and selling them for a price. 

A close source has told me that the price they paid for this producer was $30,000. An absolute shitload of money. Now, he is an awful awful producer and I know guys who could produce better while unconscious. 

This artist and her management have previously contacted me about a previous song of mine and wanting to acquire it. They had taken it off Soundcloud and put their own lyrics over it. I refused to let them buy it, as I was using it for my own ventures. They then sent me a message threatening that if I use any part of their lyrics, I was subject to copyright infringement. Quite funny considering they stole my song off Soundcloud first. 

Now to present times; they have heard the song, want it, and I'm willing to sell it to them. I just don't want to get screwed over. 

Her management has offered ""$$$$"" for the song. I hate all this dancing around numbers game. 

I'm thinking of asking for $2000 and 20% of the song profits (Just to cover my ass in case the song does get off the ground) does this sound too high/low?

That cost covers me recording the vocals with the artist, producing the song and sending them the masters.

 I want no other involvement. 

I want no face to face meetings apart from the recording day. 

I know I can make her sound half-decent and can produce a quality sounding pop track.

Help me out?

**TL;DR Artist wants my song. Need to name a price, and need to not get screwed over**

1304361208.0	h2g9z	Recent change within WatMM	Originate	197	49	62	"As you may notice we have removed the code that disabled downvoting within the /r/. There was recently a pretty aggressive thread created about a subject that we see quite frequently. The thread was created by an 8 month old user stating that (and I paraphrase) ""watmm isn't nearly as great as it used to be"". Those of us who have been around for a while know that this statements pops up quite frequently. A common response/resolution to this issue is to tell people to downvote the things that they dislike. This is a very valid point, but raises concerns with me, as I had disabled downvoting to prevent abusive downvoting. Here are my thoughts:

I originally had the downvotes removed because members were downvoting submissions that were of a music genre that they didn't like. I didn't like this idea, as we were a new /r/ and didn't want people to feel negatively about submitting their music.

We have grown in size and, while I may not agree with the some of the discussions of what content should and should not be in the /r/, I do believe that the community should be able to police itself, assuming that the posts are relatively on topic.

I think that removing the ability to downvote was an appropriate decision when we were a smaller knit community, but given our current membership base, I have reinstated downvotes. This will give our users a better opportunity to police the /r/ and make WatMM into what the community wants it to be.

I think that we will obviously see a lot more downvoting of things, which may turn quite a few people off from posting certain types of content. But disabling the ability to downvote has become a detriment to the /r/.

Please feel free to communicate your thoughts on this matter. I may not agree or institute any requested changes, but I am certainly happy to entertain any suggestions."	t5_2qmah	True
1293068428.0	eq6z3	Why you shouldn't shop at Sam Ash and Guitar Center.  	Mastertone	163	16	122	"I'm seriously curbing my anger here, so hear me out if I get a little testy.  My band tours about 220 shows a year.  We make our living doing it.  It's not glamorous, but I'm happy and not starving.  

We use wireless pickups for several of the instruments in my band.  The new guy joins the band and doesn't have equipment he needs. We stop by a Sam Ash in Cincinnati to get one.  Normally we order online, but we needed it pronto.  They had a $100 unit and we bought it (despite knowing better) because they assured us we could return it at any Sam Ash store in the country within 15 days and store credit in 30.

Naturally, the device sucked.  There were intermittent squelches at almost every show.  28 days into the 30 day grace period, we stop at the Sam Ash outside Chicago.  The dude at the front desk was immediately shady.  He tried to tell us we bought it in 2006 (even though it clearly said 2010).  It felt like a diversionary tactic.  Then he told us there was no way to give us any credit at all.  We asked to speak to a manager and he proudly stated that he was indeed the store manager.  

Then his tone changed when he asked if we were thinking about getting a better model.  He said that he might be able to get us store credit for the old one if we bought a new one, but he'd have to ask the manager (wtf???).  He then tried to sell us the most expensive model that had features we specifically told him we didn't want.

In the end we walked.  I told the douche that I thought he was lying to us.  He continued to refuse to give us store credit (because what we wanted to buy wasn't in stock) and wouldn't even let us order the unit we wanted to pick up later with said credit.

He kept saying: ""I'm just trying to help you guys!"".

I won't talk about what kind of haircut he had or what kind of music I'm sure he listened to.  It's not about that.  This guy claimed to be a musician and was trying his damndest to rip us off.  $100 is a lot of money when you run a business with a tight bottom line.  Let alone the principle.

Shop online...or even better, local.  These big-box music stores have shut down smaller music stores in Chicago.  Their inventory sucks (particularly if you're not playing rock and roll) and the staff work on commission.   

I sent a letter to their main office with no response.  Fuck em'.   Never again.

TL;DR

My band tried to exchange gear at Sam Ash.  They lied, cheated and insulted us.  Shop small music stores or online.

1375896281.0	1jw8tm	My tip for coming up with new music when you feel like you're in a creative rut	TheLostCaterpillar	175	29	54	"Firstly this might not be for everyone, but it works for my musical style. If you play punk, ska, metal, full band, etc. this might not be for you. 

I set up my loop pedal with my guitar and play 4 consecutive notes in 4/4 time (switch that up if you want). I usually use my higher strings for the first time. 

Then I'll go down a string and come up with four consecutive notes that match the first four I played. Then I go down, go down, go down, until I add a bass line. 

The result is basically four new chords that probably have cool voicing due to the ability to use notes you couldn't reach by hand in a normal chord. 

I usually let it play out for a bit and try to sing or solo over it, then add a drum beat, and vibe out on it. 

The song isn't done then but now I have a new idea, a nice melody, the rhythm in my head, and ideas about where to take the song. 

Example (not that great): On high e string in 4/4 time, play B, G, E, D. Then go to your b string and play D, E, C, A. Then continue on and on. (Just an example). 

**TL;DR** Come up with a chord progression note by note, let it ride out on your loop pedal, come up with a melody, and you have some new ideas. 

**EDIT** I made a video. I kept it raw, this was actually real. I didn't want to record a nice one because I figured I'd show you the actual process, that's why it is a tad bit embarrassing.

Details inside:	HarryMuffin	160	19	43	"In less than a month Radio Reddit has gone from a small idea of a ""Radio Reddit Night"" to a full blown internet radio station.  I'd like to announce the official launch date of December 1st, 2009. 

Radio Reddit will feature artists/users from the [WeAreTheMusicMakers](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/) subreddit as well as Reddit altogether.  The official url to connect to will be announced on December 1st in a post on reddit.com.  

If you would like to listen to the station as it's being built (we are open, and love community spirit and critiques), you can listen via http://67.212.173.251:8300/listen.pls .  

If you are an artist and would like to contribute and have your music heard, there is an FTP that will always be alive, and will be cycled once a week along with the station playlist. The FTP info and submission guidelines can be found at: http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/9skr1/watmm_radio_reddit_is_quickly_evolving_we_need/ . Fill it up!  

We are still in need of Station ID's and drops.  I.e. ""We are The Buttsniffing Corksurfers and you are listening to Radio Reddit"".  Guidelines and info can be found in the post at the url a few lines up.  

Alot of us are chatting in real time. You can join us at irc://irc.makethemusic.org/radioreddit or of course at irc.makethemusic.org in #radioreddit  . You can also join the facebook group at http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=155415299689

I'd also like to announce that Reddit.com is not officially sponsoring or endorsing this station (yet?! HELLLLOOOOO ADDDDDMMMMMIIIIIINNNNS). It is all user driven thus far.  

For those of you still scratching your heads, here is a post history about this:

I have several releases on iTunes and Spotify. I have 9 signed contracts with 6 different labels including Silk Music, Progressive House Worldwide and Morphosis Records. I have yet to see any money come from any of these contracts, and the more time that goes by the more hope I lose of receiving any royalties. Unfortunately, I know people are buying my tracks. Labels are doing promo work. A lot of fans let me know when they purchase an ep or whatever. I am gaining plenty of followers on fb, soundcloud, etc... It boils down to the percentage of royalties that I receive after beatport/itunes/whatever takes their cut and the label takes their cut. Beatport usually takes 50% and Itunes usually takes 40%. The labels usually take 40-50% after that. I am left with the remainder. For a $1.00 song on Beatport I make about 25 cents.

Most labels have a payout limit of $50. I would need to sell 200 copies of $1 songs on beatport to see any money at all. Bandcamp is great because I can give people the option of paying.

I have decided to switch my focus over to Bandcamp. I can release tracks and EP's with a 'Name Your Price Download'. The money from these releases goes directly to a paypal account under my name. I am going to try this out for a while as I forget about these labels. The downside to this is that I lose the promotional power that labels have (facebook followers/blog posts/email lists/whatever)

(Sorry about the rant... I just wanted to get this off my chest)

My first Bandcamp release are my two most recent tracks. I would fit them into the ambient/chillout genre:

I am a singer/guitarist/songwriter in Austin, Texas. I've played in professional bands before but have been inactive for a couple of years. Looking to get back into it, probably as a solo artist for the next month or so, but definitely as part of a band in a couple of months. I want to record this year and start doing some small, regional touring by summer.

I thought it would be hilarious, and possibly awesome, to have another band (same name, same Bandcamp, same Facebook page, etc) doing the same thing somewhere far, far away. So if anyone looked at our ""upcoming shows"" they would see a few in Texas and a few wherever you are. 

As for recording, thanks to recording technology we could actually record some songs together by overdubbing vocals and/or instruments. But that's a degree of collaboration that is probably wishful thinking. But we could certainly cover one anothers' songs (if we want to maintain continuity of of setlists between the two ""versions"" of the band).

Is this making sense at all?

Could be fun. Could be hilarious. Coudl turn into a true long-distance collaboration.

I don't want to say, in great detail, what my ""influences"" are, because I find that's often moer limiting than anything. But I play a lot of vintage-style Americana, I'm big on tight harmonies, I love catchy hooks, and I love bands with male AND female vocals. And I do love the Beatles (I only mention them specifically because there were three different guys singing songs they wrote, even they were all in the same band ... and that's kind of the same thing I'd be talking about with this project. Except that each singer/songwriter would have his/her own set of three other Beatles there to perform with).

As you can tell from my rambling, I haven't worked out the details. But let me know what you think, and maybe we can trade a few mp3s of our work. If we click at all, we can start thinking about a band name and get this thing going.


**EDIT: I wasn't expecting a big response, and I'm a little overwhelmed. I will respond to each of you privately. I wasn't really thinking about the language barrier. If we're going to be doing some of the same songs (written by one another), obviously it will be a little weird that half the songs are in Chinese (for example) and half in English. This isn't necessarily a fatal problem, though**


**EDIT #2: I'm thinking of the band equivalent of Tony Clifton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Clifton). He was a fictitious singer played by Andy Kaufman and several other people. I'm not saying I want this project to be a practical joke or even humorous in nature... I'm just saying it would be good to make it difficult for people to figure out what's ""really"" going on.**

Thanks so much for all your comments and suggestions. My favourites included ""switch to baritone guitars"" and, of course, the perennial standby, ""jazz odyssey"".

Obviously I didn't have time to try everybody's suggestions, but I noticed that hot water, honey and lemon were recurrent themes, so I tanked up on those as much as I could - and saved my voice during the afternoon where possible - and in the event I managed to carry off the vocals far better than I thought I'd be able to. I honestly don't think the audience even realised that there was a problem.

So thanks everyone for the suggestions and the support. If you're interested, [here's a video of one of the songs we played](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151333792225544) so you can hear how it sounded!"	t5_2qmah	True
1364150740.0	1axbpy	How to help your band grow. 	mynameisnotjonas	168	35	68	"Hello Redditshpere, my name is definitely not Jonas. I am writing this on behalf of an earlier thread in which I talked about how to book a tour. Touring is unarguably the most important part of a band's career, reason being it helps a band grow. I'm not going to tell you how to book a tour though, because that's a different post for a different day (although I'd like to post something about it sometime). Instead, I'm gonna tell you how to help your band grow (Over 90% of this has to do with touring.)

Okay, so some people on this subreddit are actually established enough to have already hit the road a few times. If that's the case, then [here](http://www.thedistractionnetwork.com/images/like-a-sir-199.jpg) is a picture of a bunny wearing a top hat. I don't want you to think you've wasted a click. Now leave. Are you gone? Okay, good.

Now that the know-it-all's are gone, I want to give advice to some people in bands who want their band to grow, and to make it easier on you, I'm gonna do it in a step-by-step process. Some of these steps, you have already done, so don't be all like, ""Hey, mynameisnotjonas, I've done that already!"" Think of it as progress you have already made. Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Be good.** Be really, really good. I know many people here already have accomplished that, but this is the most important thing you could ever possibly do. Your band is selling a product (from a business standpoint). No agent, label, manager, press or promoter is going to want to touch you with a ten-foot pole unless you have something good to offer. Make damn sure you're happy with your sound. And make sure there are enough songs for a 20+ minute set. 

2. **Play local gigs, and get more fans.** Again, many people here have probably done this already, but this is crucial. I'm not going to go into what you need to do in order to book a show, but if you'd like to get info on that, PM me. This step is assuming that you already secured a gig. Play whatever gigs you do, and win as many fans over as possible. Stick around after the show, talk to some of the attendees, and establish relationships with them. If they like you, they will make sure people know about you. They will tell their friends about you, and they will tell people to book you.

3. **Branch out to shows beyond your hometown.** You're not gonna get to doing a full-on tour yet, but you will get to travel, which is awesome sauce. Live in Los Angeles? Play gigs in San Fransisco, San Diego, Fresno, Oakland, etc. Treat every show like it's a home show. 

4. **If your band rakes in considerable profit, get a manager.** Again, some people here probably already have managers. Many of you have band members who take it upon themselves to manage the band. If you're local or indigenous, then you don't need a manager. But if it is economically wise, then do it. Managers typically get paid 15-20% of a band's earnings, so don't hire a manager if your band gets paid $50 for a gig. That's just stupid. And may I add, if your band keeps growing, this is the guy who will find you guys a label and a booking agent. Not just that, but he also handles the financing side of it by covering expenses such as gas, food, and each member's per diem rate. Make sure you hire somebody who is ready to take on those duties. 

5. This is the last step, and it isn't a step as much as it is just a general principle to abide with. But **remember two rules before you enter into the music industry:**

&gt;**Murphy's Law (if anything *can* go wrong, it *will* go wrong).** I guarantee you something will go wrong in your career. You might have a show that totally flops, you might deal with a promoter who goes AWOL, you might get a flat tire on the way to Chicago and be forced to cancel a show at the Metro. Bad things *will* happen. But remember that it is never the end of the world. Unless the Apocalypse happens, in which case, you're doomed. 

&gt;**Whenever you make a deal with any person or party, it *always* has to be a win-win.** Most people out there actually want to help bands on the rise. They really do. But they're not going to help you if you're not going to help them. The music industry is most definitely an, ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine"" industry. Think about that before getting a manager, booking a show, etc. 

If you have any questions, PM me. If I said anything wrong, I am open to constructive criticism. And destructive criticism. But I prefer constructive. "	t5_2qmah	True

But who else out there is using real guitars, basses, drums and piano? 

To me, that's where it's at. Lately I can't record acoustic pianos and drums because I'm at college, but I still play them live on MIDI keyboards/drum sets. Like I said, I'm not anti-electronic music, but to me, programming MIDI on a piano roll or playing little bits on a keyboard and then modifying them to hell just doesn't give me the same satisfaction as laying down tracks and giving each instrument a ""part."" (What I mean by that is, if I've got a song with drums, I'll usually stick with one kit the whole song. If I've got guitars, I'll only use three or four tones/amps a song, and I'll play all the parts on a real guitar. Piano, just one instrument, and I'll play the parts on an 88-key piano.)

Anybody else doing this? I guess you could call it keeping it old school?

""feel"", ""groove"", ""the pocket"", ""tightness"", ""locked""

I'm sure some of you guys have heard these words before. They are all words describing a *very abstract* quality of a musicians performance. But this quality is paramount to everything else. It's subtle, and if you were suddenly able to play perfectly in the pocket the average listener wouldn't be able to pinpoint why they like the music so much better all of a sudden. 

Here's an exercise that's all about controlling your timing, no instrument required. Go to this [online metronome](http://a.bestmetronome.com/) and set it to 30 BPM (beats per minute). Now try continuously tapping 4 notes per beat, make sure that ever beat is receieving the same amount of time and that you are falling on the click flawlessly.

Now try 2 notes per beat. Try 1 note per beat. If it's hard work to settle into the click, you know what you have to work on with your instrument ;) Know that these inconsistencies in your timing are translating (in a less obvious way) into your timing at realistic tempos.

Practicing with a metronome is hands down the best way to improve your rhythm. There comes a point where the click is no longer a rigid guide, but something that you know how to move freely through. But for you beginners, ""inaccurately playing notes because my technique is limited and my internal pulse needs a lot of work"" is not ""playing freely around the beat."" 

It will take years and years and years before you really start to grasp the concept of ""feel"" to the point where you notice when it's there or not. And when you do, you will notice when that one guy in the band is rushing the bridge ever so slightly and making everything feel completely off!

Let me make sure that I'm not necessarily advocating playing with a click at all times.  Depending on the style of music a metronome is not always appropriate, but it is an integral part of musical practice.

Remember, a long time ago, people just put a single strategically placed mic in front of a group of people and let them play. The thing is the musicians were good enough where they were able to do that and sound fucking great. It's because of groove."	t5_2qmah	True

1316903982.0	kqdom	How to solicit useful advice/input on your music.	otherwiseyep	148	17	26	"In response to a lot of stuff lately...

- First, friends and family are totally unreliable when it comes to open-ended requests for input. Some of them will say that everything you do is genius, others would pick apart Bach for being too showy and formal. 

- However, you can almost always get somewhat consistent/useful opinions if you ask specific questions, e.g., if you ask them to rate the songs from best to least favorite, or if you ask them whether the guitars are too loud, or if the song sounds too static and needs a key change. 

- Protip: asking people which aspects sound most/least ""professional"" can give them permission to tell you what you want to know, instead of what they think you want to hear. Use neutral-sounding language to get unvarnished opinions.

- **If you want useful input, take negative feedback very seriously and encourage it. Don't debate it.** One of the worst mistakes musicians make is this: let's say the bass is out-of-tune and out-of-time. The listener says something like, ""It sounds great, but there might be something a little off about the way the bass was recorded."" Musician immediately launches a lecture on how they were going for a McCartney/Jamerson-style ""expressive"" bassline to get that vintage feel and how they used flatwound strings and the counterpoint of the bass blah, blah, blah... Listener replies, ""Oh yeah, I see what you mean."" This person is merely being polite. They were on the verge of telling you something useful, but you just shut them up to satisfy your ego. Don't do that. That's why you only ever get bland ""sounds great""-style input.

- Please, for the love of God, **do not** couch your request for feedback by telling people how offhand/trivial/half-finished the thing is.  Fucking finish it before you ask for my input. If it's not an important work then don't waste my time with the awkward request to critique it. Show me the good stuff. If it's just some offhand trifle then why are you putting me in the position of having to analyze it? This is pure ego and fear, to phrase the request this way. The musician is hoping to hear, ""That's the best thing I've ever heard!"", but is hedging their bets by announcing it doesn't really matter. It's just begging for a bland response.

- If you **do** genuinely want feedback/input on something that is half-finished or that you're working on/struggling with, then ask pointed questions and *be receptive to the answers.* There is nothing worse than sticking your neck out and telling a friend/colleague that their work sounds kind of boring/repetitive, and then having them tell you why you're listening to it wrong, and how it's *supposed* to echo the oppression and monotony of modern life, or whatever. It's like, oh, okay, so you are *purposely* writing music that is meant to sound like boring drudgery. Congrats, you have succeeded. Hit the nail on the head. 

- **There is NOTHING AT ALL wrong with needing a little validation/support/encouragement.** That's what friends are for, so go ahead and ask for it. But do *ask for it.* Saying ""what do you think?"" sounds like an invitation to critique. Doing so while hoping for encouragement is lazy, unfair, and a little disingenuous. Instead, say something like ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed/discouraged/down, and I need to know whether this is a complete waste of time. Believe me, I know this isn't perfect, but I'm going a little crazy and need someone to tell me whether there is anything here worth working on."" This is vastly better than ""be gentle"" or ""keep in mind it's not finished"" or anything like that. 

- To that last point, don't waste anyone's time with ""keep in mind it's not finished."" That's like saying: listen to this, but imagine it's good, and then tell me what you think of the pretend song. It's fine to ask for input on unfinished work or raw ideas, but make it clear that you are asking for input on what currently exists, not what it will be when it's done. You can ask people whether a vacant lot is in a good location, etc, but asking them to pretend that it's landscaped with a dream house on it, and then asking them what they think of the house is delusional. 

- Perk up your ears when you hear things like ""This could be a really good song"", or ""I like the direction you're going with this"" or ""there's some really good stuff in there""... **That is a person who is thinking more than they are saying.** You could go fishing for compliments by asking ""how so?"", or you could drill down by asking pointed and specific questions such as ""I think so too, but I feel like I'm hitting a roadblock. I know something needs work, but I'm not sure what.""

When a girl is looking for reassurance/compliments, she asks ""how do I look?"", or maybe ""do these jeans make my ass look too big?"" When she is looking for advice/input, she asks, ""Which jeans do you think look better on me?""

**TL;DR: when you want genuine advice/input, ask specific questions using either/or questions or ""neutral"" terms (e.g., ""professional"" instead of ""good""). When you want support/affirmation/encouragement, telegraph it by saying that you need it.**"	t5_2qmah	True

I'm going to go ahead and give some background. I'm a jazz guy, saxophone specifically. I've been playing for nearly 10 years. I've played in a wide range of genres: classical, rock, alternative, funk, gospel, hip hop, blues, gypsy, and more, but I call jazz home.  I also double on flute and clarinet.

Jazz isn't a genre dominated by the singer-songwriter types or dreams of making it big.  It has a fairly small audience and a wide variety of sub genres. It can be complex and heady, it can also be raw and emotional. That sounds like any other genre.  The one trend I've noticed that seems to be fairly exclusive to jazz (and classical, I guess) is a dedication to mastering the instrument. My friends and I spend hours every single day in the woodshed, and ultimately, you can tell. That's cocky and arrogant, but hear me out.

Now here's what I want to say:  practice your goddam instruments. I hope it's an issue exclusive to my city, but I fear that it isn't. I hear (and sometimes play with) musicians with great ideas, ambition, etc. that are completed limited by the fact that they can barely play their instruments. I'm not demanding that you be the next Joe Pass, but shit guys, get it together.

By hanging out with musicians who don't know my background while staying under the radar, I've managed to hear some pretty mind boggling statements...

You hear the guys talking about being able to play guitar, bass, and ""learning drum set in less than 3 months!"" and you can't help but wonder if they're serious.  The audience can tell you ""learned"" drum set in less than months.   I definitely can. Get it together.

Even better, I've heard musicians trashing us jazz cats after losing gigs, roles in bands, etc to us. In case you're not aware, the vast majority of studio players and session artists have a jazz education. Jazz might introduce flexibility, but more importantly, it makes you learn how to really play your instrument.  We earn the gigs because we practice out asses off. Not because we have a cool band name and tshirts.

The last thing that comes to mind at the moment is more aimed towards horn players: unless you're actively studying and practicing a horn, leave it in the case. I don't care if you played saxophone in middle school. Pulling it out on a gig where you were actually impressing me on guitar beforehand will make me leave and the audience cringe. 

In conclusion (and in my defense), I've listened to a lot of you guys. Some of you can play really well! Others have a ways to go, but I hear improvement. Just practice. Please. Great ideas are inhibited by unfamiliarity with your instruments.  

TL;DR: Practice makes perfect.

Edit: That's a pretty lame TL;DR. As pointed out, practice makes permanent, as perfect is always going to be out of our grasp. I'm not asking for prodigal skill, just competence. As predicted, some of you took offense. My apologies.

Edit 2: I'm not claiming jazz is the only genre with musicians very proficient on their instruments, it's just the genre I'm most familiar with. Classical and as I'm learning today, metal, also have a large percentage of skilled instrumentalists. Obviously other genres do as well, but they seem more afflicted by the aforementioned issue.

Edit 3: I just wanted to shoot down a counter argument that some people are trying to formulate- being self taught DOES NOT means someone hasn't spent hours practicing their craft. Self teaching leads to unorthodox habits and often innovation, but it still implies a large (often more so than a formal education) amount of practicing."	t5_2qmah	True

*edit2* I am closing the FTP. We will be putting up a website and have a better submittal process soon. 

Note: I cross posted on the main Reddit site to try and get non-watmm people involved. Hopefully it will eventually make it to an admin. [You can upvote it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/a9y9t/tonight_is_the_big_night_radio_reddit_is_going/)

For those who have not been following, we have been planning the introduction of a non-official user driven Reddit based radio station that features Reddit bands and artists.  

At first we just did a ""Radio Reddit"" night to see how it would go. The station was filled to capacity within minutes.  

The ""official"" start time is at 7pm EST tonight (December 1st).  The station features a few hundred artists and bands, mostly from the  subreddit ""WeAreTheMusicMakers"", and has a wide spectrum of different musical styles.  

The plan is to keep adding content to the station and to maintain it's growth. Eventually we'd like to have featured bands and artists in a scheduled playlist, live stream shows, and have redditor dj's.  

**You can listen to the stream at:** http://67.212.173.251:8300/listen.pls

You can continue to upload your content by using the following information:

FTP Username: reddit@thezengeek.com Password: watmm FTP Server: ftp.bitkins.com FTP Server Port: 21

You can also talk in realtime: irc.makethemusic.org #radioreddit or irc://makethemusic.org/radioreddit

We also have a facebook group that is gaining steam at: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=155415299689

If you are looking for a subreddit specializing in only links to user-made music, try posting to /r/ThisIsOurMusic

A few simple guidelines for the feedback threads:

* If you post your music here, give three other comments with some honest, constructive criticism and remember each person has their own style. Help them cultivate that, not your own style.

* [Listen] posts are only allowed in the feedback threads, posted monday and friday. If you're late, look for the most recent post, as they are likely to die off each time a new thread is posted.

* Don't drop your link and gtfo on us. Post what kind of feedback you are hoping to receive (mixing advice? snares working? is this listenable? etc.) and reply to someone if they take the time to comment on your music. This is common sense.

* Posted your music recently? Let someone else post today. Avoid spamming.

My family said that my audio degree was worthless because I hadn't had a job yet; they disregarded the fact that I graduated college just 5 days ago. This wouldn't have happened if my mother was still alive... So I left and I vowed to prove my family wrong.  I slaved for the last 5 years doing a job that completely halted my music production. I slacked, twisted, turned, pulled, shoved, and clawed my way through a couple of songs during that time-frame, last song being in for a charity event in February, and that was a collaboration mostly.  

A months ago, I tried to kill myself, after long agonizing moments where I would have revelations over the thought that I, a homosexual, had no place to call home. 

I got help, stayed with friends so they could help me get out of this depression. I took anti-depressants, and it would get better... but nothing was helping to keep me solid. I would dip back down into the bottom-less pit. 

I don't know what motivated me to make this song but ...

It would mean a great deal to me if someone were so kind to cut the ""rock"" part, yet retain the lenght of the song with some clever cutting and editting.

I hope one of you guys can help me out. I need to deliver the music within 24 hours and this is kindof my last resort.

The thieves did their research - cut the power, phone, and alarm lines before breaking in, and were there at least four hours.


**PLEASE keep your eyes out for cheap vintage gear on the market**, prices too good to be true. Since this happened in Tampa, I'd bet much of this gear is going for sale along I-75 in Atlanta/Miami and on craigslist/ebay.

* Macs just work - no unexpected crashes during shows, better hardware compatibility, and more consistency are desirable.

* Mac bought Logic, so Logic users bought Macs.

1295535655.0	f5to1	Reddit songwriting challenge: Let's write a pop hit!	it_shits_hits	124	9	136	"Hi musicmakers,

Lately, I’ve been interested in the idea of writing pop hits for other artists. Writing music is a hobby for me and I don’t have much contacts in the industry. I thought a good idea to pratice my writing skills and be motivated would be to simulate the demand of an artist for a top 40 hit song. Then this idea grew into a bigger one.

What would you think of a full-on pop music writing challenge on Reddit?

* We could suggest artists that would be interested in songs from other people and choose two or three of them. It could be anyone from an aspiring artist to a superstar. We could even ask help from other Redditors if we hit front page with our challenge idea. 

* The writing phase could be a mix of contest and collaboration between Redditors. For example, I sing like shit, so I could use some help with the vocals. Also, my English is not perfect. Maybe someone could give me a hand with the lyrics if needed. 

* We could publish the results on Soundcloud and hit frontpage to show our work to other Redditors. And, why not, maybe someone who has contacts in the industry could be interested. 

I’ve seen Reddit do awesome things in the past and the idea of holding a friendly contest could yield awesome results. But the important thing here is to have fun and practice our songwriting skills.  And who knows, maybe the outcome could be the beginning of collaborations between Redditors, or a hit machine that writes music for movies or artists.

What do you think?

**Edit:** Questions about musical direction and organization are starting to pop-up in the comments and my mailbox, so here's how I see things. 

* Regarding musical direction, I really think it should be wide open. The initial goal was to gain mainstream attention for music done in collaboration between Redditors. I think I overemphasized the term ""pop"" in my initial submission. It can be anything really, from Hip Hop to Indie Rock. 

* Regarding organization, I think we all agree that producing a single song is impossible for many reasons. I invite everyone to team up with other Redditors and start multiple projects. Help can be requested later to other Redditors (orchestration, mixing, recording an analog bassline, replacing the vocals, adding back vocals, etc.). Since everyone works differently, I think we could let the ""teams"" find their own way of collaborating using the tools they choose. 

Eventually, I see a subreddit dedicated to this project but I don't think we're there yet. This subreddit could contain posts about useful tools, keep track of the projects and help us gain attention from other Redditors who could help (publishing, airplay, etc.). I suggest we let things flow for a couple of hours. Fell free to come up with any suggestions.

**Edit**: I don't see a definite timeframe for this project. What I'd like though, is that we make sure we have enough good stuff before we go ""mainstream"" with this. It could take months.

Theophagist	135	22	38	"As a chef/restauranteur I always looked for negative comments and worked with them..  Anyone who watches any of Gordon Ramsay's shows knows he does the same thing.   It's the negative comments that make you improve.. Dissent in general is a catalyst of progress and should be welcomed to a degree.

You might get but-hurt if you find out no one likes your mamma's lasagna, but if that's the case then serve then serve a different recipe, and eat your mamma's lasagna at home.  

The same goes for any music I write.. If I want it to be heard and appreciated, I want to know what people thought sucked about it. If lots of people love it, cool.  But can it be better?  Some picky listener thinks so!

On the other hand,  If I don't care what you think about a particular song, then I'm not even going to play it for you.. What would I do that for?  

Anyhow, my point is people shouldn't take it so hard when folks offer harsh criticism.  Even a simple ""wut iz this shit"" may deserve no attention... On the other hand, you may find yourself stepping back and thinking.. ""Hey.. What IS this shit, anyhow...""  It's humbling, even humiliating.  Deal with it! It's good for you."	t5_2qmah	True

There's also a six month old question with no response in their get satisfaction account posing the same question.  Does Grooveshark revenue share with independent artists that their users upload or do they only revenue share with the major labels that sue them?

Reddit loves Grooveshark, but they are not reaching out to independents or making it easy to receive any revenue sharing as far as I can tell - even though their site claims to make an effort to make sure artists get paid.  They are on a hiring spree having bought ads on reddit.com, so they aren't lacking in funds.

But leave that choice to artists, please.	zirconst	141	34	66	"After 5+ years of work, countless hours and thousands of dollars of my own money, with no label support, I released my 10th album [Identity Sequence](http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/album/identity-sequence) - a cyberpunk-influenced concept album in the general style of electronic dance music. This was a real labor of love and to help make the physical production happen, my friends &amp; fans contributed to a successful Kickstarter campaign (of which I made little profit, and instead put almost all the money back into backer rewards!)

Unfortunately, I saw today that when you search ""identity sequence"" zircon, a torrent of the album is on the front page. There's really nothing I can do about this. It's just disappointing. I have no problem with people sharing my music with friends. And I have TONS of music for free out there (hours upon hours), along with free streaming on Bandcamp, YouTube, Spotify, etc. So I absolutely do support this model. But I would rather be given the choice. It makes me sad that TPB (and other torrent sites) take no responsibility for content uploaded, refuse removal requests, and make money via ads from my content.

(leadguitar for live shows) They are serious about making it in the industry, and have recorded their EP with top producers and engineers. Ever since my first rehersal with them, I could immediately tell that image and money is extremely important to them. 

I am currently playing with them because working with them and rehearsing with them makes myself an overall better musician for I get to learn many new things about the industry. 

However, during rehearsals they say many obnoxious and ignorant comments. Such as; ""Why don't you get a *REAL* Les Paul? Since we are industry professionals, we need professional equipment"". OR.. ""Since we can't get the specific tone we want out of your amp (which is a voxac30) - we are going to run your guitar tone through the computer [Logic's guitar amp plug in]. Many other comments about how their fame will turn into fortune are blurted out throughout the entire practice. 

I feel as if the band focuses more on how they should present themselves rather than how the music should present them. We've only been jamming for a couple of months now but shows and CD release party is coming up. 

Based from the little snip of information I have given you, are there any professionals in the industry who are willing to give me advice on how to deal with this situation? I almost feel like leaving the band and not playing, because they really do get on my nerves ~~sometimes~~, but at the same time, it is an eye opening opportunity.

There are many paths to becoming a paid musician, none of them easy, none of them cheap and all of them with a lot of wiggle room. While people can write entire book series on what I am saying here, I have tried to condense what I have into this post. I hope you find it helpful…

1)	**Your Product**

a.	Your music is your product. You are (in addition to being the manufacturer) the lead sales representative for your product. This follows all of the rules that a normal product would follow to make money (you have a product, it costs X to make said product, You sell it for Y amount and make the difference). This is a key concept that many artists fail to understand. 

b.	Your product must be at a quality that people want to buy. This means professional sounding recordings, professional looking art and graphic work and professional packaging. Industry has made the costs of these fall dramatically in the past few years but you still need to invest money into this. Unfortunately, most of the time, a DIY bedroom recording is not going to cut it as a sellable product. Go to a studio, find someone with experience and pay them the money to help you. (sidenote, always haggle with these people, they will ask for a budget, tell them your budget and then come back later with half the budget. But be willing to spend no less than $1000 US for a full length CD, 8-9 songs without full band)

c.	Create a package for your product. Make sure this package is appealing and sends the message that you want it to. A lot of the time you should pay for a graphic designer or visual artist to do this for you, unless you have talent there too. Then create the product. CDbaby.com has competitive rates as well as will host and distribute your CD online. This is really handy for new artists who do not have label representation or a distribution outlet. Order a few CDs from them to have physical copies, but no more than your budget will allow. Digital Distribution is the key to Indie artist success and is a whole lot cheaper. Pay the $90 on CDbaby or other distributing site for Itunes, Amazon, Spotify etc distribution, it will help.

d.	Ta-Da you have a product that is professional grade. If you are unsure on the grade then it is not professional grade. Now what to do with your product?

So E-flat leaves, and C and G have an open fifth between them. After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and G is out flat. F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough.

Then D comes in and heads for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second.""

Then A comes in, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor.

Then the bartender notices B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and says, ""Get out! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight.""

E-flat comes back the next night in a three-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender says, ""you're looking sharp tonight. Come on in, this could be a major development."" Sure enough, E-flat soon takes off his suit and everything else, and is au natural.

Eventually, C, who had passed out under the bar the night before, begins to sober up and realizes in horror that he's under a rest. So, C goes to trial, is convicted of contributing to the diminution of a minor and sentenced to 10 years of DS without Coda at an up scale correctional facility.

The conviction is overturned on appeal, however, and C is found innocent of any wrongdoing, even accidental, and that all accusations to the contrary are bassless.

The bartender decides, however, that since he's only had tenor so patrons, the soprano out in the bathroom and everything has become alto much treble, he needs a rest and closes the bar. "	t5_2qmah	True
1335635145.0	sx062	VSTs for glitching/stuttering - primarily vocals (ala Celldweller) - a list of what I've tried and the pros/cons of each	brianvaughn	122	21	116	"**Edit**: This is not intended to be a formal review. Rather, a place for people to share techniques and tools. I've only purchased a few of the tools that are available but I've written a quick review of each. Others have mentioned some additional tools to try- and I intend to. In the meanwhile, I'll at least try to move them up here to the header so they're easier for people to find.

I've hung around [/r/WATMM](/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers) long enough to know that this type of post runs the risk of being down-voted, but please consider that I've spent a fair amount of effort researching before creating this post. Hopefully it will be helpful to others like me.

Most of what I record is rock or metal, but for the past few months I've begun dabbling in electronic music. During this time I've looked for VST plugins (for vocals, primarily) that offer that neat gritty/grungy/stuttery sound that artists like [Klayton/Celldweller](http://www.celldweller.com/2011/) use. I realize that a lot of what Klayton does is probably a very manual process of hand-crafting sounds. (He seems like the type.) But I believe there are some plugins that can at least mimic the style.

Before proceeding, here are a couple of examples of what I'm talking about:

* [Eon @ 4:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QLVxOvESf4&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=257s)
* [Gift for You @ 5:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=L27O8zPgzxo#t=304s)
* [I Can't Wait @ 1:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0kkbYuYhZBw#t=100s)
* [The Lucky One @ 2:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=dMwK7RSVi7g#t=157s)
* [Switchback @ 0:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=knV1H163ISE#t=36s)

Okay. Enough examples. So what have I tried (besides manually chopping and shifting my vocal tracks)? So far, these:

* **[iZotope Stutter Edit](http://www.izotope.com/products/audio/stutteredit/)** $249: I've had some limited success with this one. It offers a lot of options and a pretty big variety of sounds. It's also midi triggered- each of the effects within a given preset is associated with a specific MIDI note. This makes triggering the effects pretty simple. Unfortunately, most of the options end up mangling a vocal track too much to be usable IMO. (This probably depends on the type of music you're making.)
* **[Sugar Bytes Effectrix](http://sugar-bytes.de/content/products/Effectrix/index.php)** $129 - This one works decently with vocals. A lot of the presets mangle things too much but it still has quite a few that work. The UI is not very good though. Effects can be triggered in one of 2 ways: (1) using a pattern editor (that's synced to the project timeline) or (2) using MIDI. The problem with the pattern editor is that you can only get 12 patterns per instance of the VST- so if you want to do a lot of processing, you'll need several instances of this guy. The MIDI route on the other hand only starts/stops the patterns. Unlike *Stutter Edit*, the MIDI notes don't trigger effects directly. So.. this one has potential but it's a bit clunky to work with.
* **[dblue Glitch](http://illformed.org/plugins/glitch/)** $0: This one seems to have great potential- both from what people say about it and from what I've been able to hear. Unfortunately though it doesn't quite work for me. When I add it as an Insert on a track, I can hear it working, but the VST window is empty. The only way I can think of to control the plugin would be to use one of the ~80 automation options. That route seems pretty painful, as many of the options are named vaguely (ex. ""Rand FX 7"").

There are some other plugs that I've read about but haven't spent much time playing with yet:

* **[Sugar Bytes Turnado](http://www.sugar-bytes.de/content/products/Turnado/index.php)** $179: I've only just installed this VST recently so I can't comment on it yet. It sounds like it has some neat effects, and it has a a rather unique UI compared to the other plugs. You have 8 effects banks that you can assign to. Each bank also has a knob that controls the effect. It's not a volume knob though, it often controls things like the speed of the effect. It seems to have promise but until I buy it I can't say for sure. (The trial version doesn't persist settings and so I haven't used it in depth yet.)
* **[Native Instruments - The Finger](http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kore/the-finger/)** $79 - I haven't tried this one yet simply because the demos NI posted don't sound any different from *Stutter Edit* or *Effectrix*. Since I already own those, I don't see the value of adding this. Many of *The Finger's* demo sounds seem to garble the source audio too much for use with vocals anyway.
* **[Image Line's Gross Beat](http://www.image-line.com/documents/grossbeat.html)** $99: From the makers of the much-beloved FL Studio. Haven't tried this one yet but after going through IL's demos I am interested in giving it a try. The UI seems at least as good as any of the other ones I've mentioned and the demo sounds are promising.

And, because it's important, I'm running Windows 7 and Cubase 6 (64-bit). I realize that some of the above effects (ex. Glitch) are Windows-only. There are probably some Mac-only effects as well.

Which plug-ins or techniques have you guys used? I'd love to hear about them.

For pictures of us in our new French maid outfits please message Originate at your own risk.

[Listen] and [Feedback] post are an essential part of an online community of people who make music. We have decided to run a feedback thread a few times a week to give everyone a place to post their tracks in the hopes of receiving well thought out and helpful advice, without crowding the front page with nothing but personal soundcloud links.

It's not the first time we've had a feedback thread. However, this time the posts outside of the thread will be reminded to post in the official feedback thread, and the post will be removed.

We may need your help in keeping listen posts off the front page. If you see someone posting their music in the wrong page, feel free to politely remind them where the feedback thread is and let them know the rules. Remember that some people are new or wont see this, and it will take a while for misplaced [Listen] posts to lower in frequency, so have some patience.

That being said, we may do a few other things in the near future to tidy up the sidebar and keep the integrity of this community the way it is:

If there is a problem with me posting here, please let me know...


DEMO VID: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IlSeZEMhA


So it's finished! A monophonic subtractive synth with a pitch tracking algorithm. It has been designed for use with electric guitar, but you can run a bass or a microphone through it (with varying results...feel free to experiment). 


This has been designed for guitarists who want to make electronic music, but can't play keyboard. Comes in 3 versions: beginner, intermediate and advanced. Each version has its own in-built tutorial to guide you through.


Check the video out for the features. My favourite is probably the WAV mode. You can run audio files through the synth instead of playing live. Got a recording of a trombone part? Synth it up!


This is my first piece of software. I've listed it as a classified ad on ebay. I was really hoping to use the ""buy it now"" feature, but ebay is a bit weird about downloads, so I had to use the classified ad format which sucks...you can contact me through ebay or reddit, or email me at deansumner@sky.com


http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/281115809507?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649


If you don't want to talk and just want the software, you can send $10 to my paypal account and I'll send the download link. Please note - there is nothing to stop you sharing/torrenting/selling this software. I'm just hoping you don't do that. It's a very reasonable price, the software works great, and I've put a lot of effort into it. Please support me!


I'm very excited about releasing this software. Feel free to contact me if you have any problems. It works as a standalone (no DAW support yet, although there is a metronome and record out function so you can use the synth in your projects). It's a simple .app icon - drag and drop to the desktop and double click to run. Obviously, you'll need an audio interface to connect your guitar to the computer.


Thanks a lot guys! Special shout out to reddit user commathe. Without your help I would not have made it this far!


EDIT: First sale! That's a very big deal to me. Thanks a lot! Feel free to post questions/reviews/anything else that's relevant here.

EDIT 2: Beginner version will be up for free download tomorrow....


EDIT 3: Beginner version will be available to try out for free around noon UK time. Just need to run to university to use a Mac...

EDIT 4: I've downloaded Dropbox, and have placed the beginner versions in my download folder. I'm new to this system, but I think I've done it right. I've uploaded and downloaded Windows and Mac versions, both seem to work fine...let me know if this is not the case. If someone could PM me to let me know the dropbox links work, I'll sleep much easier tonight.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/qp0j91r5awf2j5v/Windows%20Precision%20Guitar%20Synth%20Beginner.zip

Something to note - I find the synth works best when using the bridge pick up with the tone rolled all the way down. Also, if you are having problems getting a sound out, click ""INPUTS/OUTPUTS"" in the top right hand corner. It doesn't look like a button, but it is one. Hope this has all gone according to plan....

I sent them this email letting them know why I wont participate. Here is their email if you would like to do the same (especially if you are from NJ).  Maybe we can change something.
info@strongerthanthestorm.com

Dear STTS,
I recently saw the contest you are running to find the Jersey Shore's official song of the summer.  As a life long New Jersey resident and a local musician I was interested, but after reviewing the contest I have decided not to enter, and I would like to take a few minutes to tell you why.

As far as I can tell from the website, you want artists to write a song, record the song, and shoot a video for the song, and then give you non-exclusive, irrevocable rights to the song, as well as forfeit all proceeds generated in this context by the song.  As a prize for winning this contest, the winner gets to perform (for free and at your discretion) opening for an unnamed band.  

While I understand this is a campaign to help restore tourism and business to New Jersey, you are doing so by actively exploiting the local artistic community.  Music as a hobby is an expensive pastime and music as a business is nearly impossible.  The cost of writing, recording and shooting a video is minimally hundreds of dollars and easily thousands, not to mention a lifetime of training, practice and dedication.  Exposure and being recognized for artistic output are very nice things, but they do not feed my family or pay my mortgage (or taxes...this is New Jersey after all).  

I am sure there are many people who will enter this contest, because as musicians we love to create and as New Jerseyans we are proud of our state.  I would ask that you please reconsider your prize structure to make a contest that doesn't exploit local musicians, and make this a contest that I want to participate in and win.  Honestly, a nice guitar (think a “made in the U.S.A.” Fender, or Gibson Les Paul) signed by the headlining act, and reasonable compensation for the opening performance slot is all it would take to make this contest a really great thing for a struggling musician.  

I hope this email doesn't come across as cynical or jaded.  If I have misunderstood the terms or any aspect of this contest please forgive me and feel free to correct me (I am a musician not a lawyer, so that rules page was a little daunting for me).  Also, please feel free to contact me if there any changes made to this contest so I can reexamine my decision not to participate.  Thank you for your time and I truly hope you take what I have written into consideration.

Best of luck,
livingsound

Upon my return I tried it out to find out it was defective; I tried it out once before I left and it worked okay but after plugging it in and using it for about 5 minutes it completely shut off. I emailed customer service and their reply? ""Due to the complex nature of this product it seems a repair is not possible"". They also mentioned that they would not replace my unit. Basically, they gave me a big ""fuck you"".


I'm just posting this as a public service announcement to refrain from buying Line 6 products. I should have done my research beforehand; after looking around I've discovered the company isn't necessarily known for quality products. Please don't make the same mistake as I did.

A friend of mine told me about this about a year ago -
You have one day to write, arrange and record 20 full songs. This includes lyrics (though instrumentals are fine if that's more of your thing).
I tried it last spring and highly recommend it - I think the insane time limit truly forces you to purge your system of song ideas.

Would /r/wearethemusicmakers wanna try this out and post the results here?

EDIT::
So I forgot to mention that the initial reaction is ""there's no way I can write 20 decent songs in a day, let alone 2 or 3"". And that's sort of the point. You shoot much higher than is actually possible and see what happens."	t5_2qmah	True

Got a friend who has been playing guitar almost as long as I have. She has never learned the fundamentals/theory.

She now wants to start a band and start gigging. She can't learn songs with a band though because she just plays by ear. So if the bass player asks her to play an Em, she can't do it. I have asked her, and she has agreed, to learn some of the basics. We having been practicing a couple months and she still has not memorized the major scale or learned the open chords. 

She says that she works on it everyday but it just takes her a long time. Not really sure what to do. The other bandmates are frustrated about this as it is holding us up. But we don't want to get mad at our friend.

It just doesn't make sense that she practices memorizing the major scale and open chords on guitar everyday for weeks and can't memorize them. She has played for ten years."	t5_2qmah	True
