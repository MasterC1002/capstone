**Edit: Gibbon is interested in doing an AMA, expect the post to show up soon. Dudes and dudettes, prepare your questions!**

**Edit 2: AMA will be on Friday 8/10**

**Edit 3: looks like Gibbon is taking this opportunity very seriously, however they won't be able to make the AMA today (Friday) and their reasoning is: *""...it will have to wait till Monday. I don't want to start unless I know I have time to respond all day.""* (-Emilio Torres, Gibbon's VP of Sales and Marketing) I told him that it's a good idea to respond to the questions as soon as they are posted, so Mr. Torres wants to wait till Monday when he, and his team, will have more time to answer the questions. So AMA will be postponed till *Monday*.**"	t5_2rbhm	True

In order to combat this issue and help out the people that are new to slacklining and looking for contacts, there are a few things we should all do:

* First of all, if you haven't already, you should all add yourselves to the [Balance Community Slackliner Database](https://www.balancecommunity.com/Slackliner-Database). It's super useful and it only takes a few seconds to add yourself to it!

* And second-of-ly, you should all register with [SlackLink](http://slacklink.org/) and add all of your favourite slacklining locations to their [SlackMap](http://slacklink.org/index.php/slackmap). The SlackMap is relatively new, and doesn't have many locations yet, but it has tons of potential to be an incredible resource for slackliners all

Without him I don't think I'd ever have had the bravery to try the thing out on my own. (Now even when I go on my own I'm acting a fool on it) I can't balance for crap but I try to spend some time on it every time I go. I feel like once I have my own I can get competent on it much, much faster.

I finally took the plunge and ordered one yesterday, the gibbon dual ratchet set. It kinda bugged me that there were so many reported issues with it, that it was heavy, that it'd fall apart sooner than it should, etc, but I ordered it anyway. Something about it just didn't sit right with me. After I ordered I was so, so lucky to find /r/slackline and the sidebar guides quickly led me to confidence in building a primitive setup. I canceled my order on Amazon immediately and now I'm waiting on my [standard kit](http://i.imgur.com/co63fWs.png) from REI. At first I was looking at the kit images people posted on here and scratched my head. I couldn't figure out how you could make it work. The ingenious rigging method used, is to me is so satisfying, so much more than the ratchets.

I'm sure these posts come up all the time, but still, I feel like this subreddit saved me at the last moment and set me on the right path to a long term enjoyment of slacklining, so thank you.

As a small gift, I'm converting the slackline tension calculator in the sidebar into a self contained web page/script. Will post an update about that when I'm done.

**Update: I've finished the first version of the slackline load calculator. This is free software, do with it what you will. It's a single file, self contained app, so if you save the page to your computer you can take it with you and run it in a browser on any device and it should work the same.

He's a cool guy too.

I was wondering if it is possible to design some thing that's kind of a side view. Like having the line be a really wide V, then have the alien standing on that, and also have the word ""reddit"" slanted on the line as well? 

What do you guys think?

Here is [the playlist with all five](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuLH9poakg-t4riFQbDKQSUocX6e996y) segments, or individual videos are:

* Part 1 ([Slings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heNlBAkwqiY))

* Part 2 ([Webbing Anchors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7pDtPce9xU))

* Part 3 ([Webbing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUKDoIpOGY))

* Part 4 ([Tension Systems](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0OhGIVqa0))

* Part 5 ([Walking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LwaoyZjjg))

Next up on the video project list (as school and weather allow) will be a guide to softpointing (covering 5 different techniques), a video about dynos, and a dozen or so detailed webbing reviews.

Lastly, you may have noticed many of the videos now have banners or other youtube-inserted ads.  I resisted for a long time monetizing the videos because ads can be kind of annoying, but on the other hand people are getting my videos for free, and when some of those people click the links that means an occasional advertising revenue check from google for me — which allows me to buy gear that I can destroy in break tests or otherwise do something cool with on video, so I decided it made sense to enable the ads by default on most of my videos.  People clicking the ads doesn't mean a LOT of revenue (sadly I don't think I get any if they just watch an ad, haha), but it does mean a bit, and that buys some gear, so hopefully y'all don't find the ads too annoying.

I had seen videos online and was always curious about it. I've always loved balancing on things since I was little so I knew if I gave it a go I would like it, but man I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. 

I was fairly drunk so it took a while to get used to it but I ended up picking it up fairly quick, though I was kind of annoyed that I had a drink as I know I would have done so much better if I was sober. 

I ordered a line straight away from Amazon. I can't wait for it to arrive this week! 

I'm on a bit of a health kick at the minute and I think it's going to be the thing I do that will really change my fitness level as I know I'm gona be wanting to do it all the time.

I'm also going to Thailand next month so It will be an awesome toy to take to the beach!

I'm looking forward to being part of this community here on Reddit. One thing I liked so much about doing it yesterday was just how nice the people were that do it. As soon as I talked about possibly buying one the guys told me all about the community that they're a part of that get together every weekend for slacklining sessions. Sounds awesome!"	t5_2rbhm	True

I have seven layers of 2x6 in a tiered configuration.  All layers are completely glued and screwed together.  For each layer, I used several 3"" screws with a bit of a shoulder to clamp down on the glue.  The space between the slackline and the top of the main member is about 11"".  All the lumber cost about $23 USD.   Box of screws $5.  Bottle of glue $3.  Easy.

Additional info:
If you aren't lazy like me, you should really drill pilot holes for the ""tiers"" to ensure that the screws are clamping the wood together.  Each piece of wood is not perfectly flat so you need to put several screws down.  Once the wood glue dries, it will provide much more strength than the screws; the tiers become one solid piece which doesn't creak.  On the sides of the tiers, i penciled in hash marks to indicate whether i used one (in the middle) or two screws (one at 1/3 and another at 2/3).  For each layer I alternated the pattern to keep from screwing into a screwhead from the layer below.  Also, I noticed that the 4x6 still flexes slightly when I jump onto the middle of the slackline.  For a 10' span, I find it acceptable."	t5_2rbhm	True

1343429395.0	x9swl	Re: PTEN AMA	F0B	15	1	17	"I met Kyle, owner of PTEN, at the beach where I slack several months ago. I tried their line and it felt awesome, so I started to help promote their products. A few days ago, I told him that he should start an AMA on /r/slackline so he can reveal more information about his products than just me saying that PTEN webbing is pretty good. 

Since I got him to write up that AMA, I figured I'm kinda obligated to explain what I know. 

He is a very very new redditor, so he is not familiar with rediquette or the rules or anything quite yet. So a couple of days ago, he makes AMA post. I approved it, made the verification post, then stopped following it. Then last night, I get a txt from him asking how to delete that AMA. I checked his account and the front page, and the AMA was already gone. I advised him to not delete the post, but it was too late.

I just got home from work and saw Detailorient's post. After reading most of the comments in the AMA and the MFW posts, here are my thoughts:

1. PTEN is a new start-up. They are barely starting to make a little profit. The company is started by a few college grads, so they don't have much experience in business. and they aimed to help grow the sport, and, ofc, make some profit. 
2. As a start-up, they don't really have any legal experience either. So that's probably why they were really hesitant to answer and ignored some questions about rigging and safety.
3. With no offense to Adam, but I believe his questions were kind of close to PTEN's trade secrets. I think the weave and the material of the slackline is unique to every company, so it's probably not a good idea to publicly release that kind of information. Also, I believe Adam is trying to start a company as well ( I might be wrong), so releasing these information to a possible competitor is probably not a good idea.
4. They aren't very experienced with the fancy rigging that we do. They wanted to focus on ratchets, so anyone can slack. That being said, I don't think they would know anything about rigging with pulleys.

They are still growing, and are in the learning stages, too. For some of the complicated problems, I don't think they know the answer either. Even though they made many mistakes in the AMA, I don't think it's reasonable to call them douches. 

I just wanted to bring in some new content to this subreddit, didn't expect it to erupt into drama. 

And this is gonna come across as me defending PTEN, but I just wanted to say I have no affiliation with them.

Edit: I'm texting Kyle right now, and hopefully, he can come back and give us an explanation. 

Edit 2: I've been talking to ewheat, and he pointed out that I've said that I worked with PTEN before. And since I said I have no affiliation with them, it seems like I'm contradicting myself. This is my clarification: At the beach where I slack, there aren't many trickliners. Me being decent at tricklining, caught PTEN's attention. In hopes of eventually becoming a sponsored athlete and get cool shitz, I start to promote their products and providing my assistance. But I was never technically included in their company. I didn't expect this to happen from a simple AMA. As someone who has founded a couple of start-ups that eventually failed, I know how difficult it is for a new company. As a friend of the founders of PTEN, I just wanted to clarify what I know in attempt to save some reputation...I guess. As for the hating Gibbon thing, I don't hate Gibbon, I just hate the ClassicLine. IMO, it's not worth the money. Since I recently became mod, it's probably a good idea to make everything clear, so I don't get shit later :D"	t5_2rbhm	True
1340048823.0	v8ltr	r/Slackline FAQ	rSlackline_FAQ	19	4	12	"**What is slacklining:** The art of balancing on a flat piece of webbing anchored between two points.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Types of Slackline:**

* **Primitive line:** This kind of set up is usually less than 100ft long and a few ft high. This is the easiest setup, requiring only several carabiners and climb-spec of mil-spec webbing.

* **Longline:** A line that is not very high off the ground, but can be hundreds of feet long.

* **Highline:** A line that is set up very high up from the ground. Usually the slackliner wears a harness and is leashed on the line it self.

* **Trickline:** A line that is extremely elastic under tension. Designed to let the slackliner bounce high for dynamic moves/tricks.

* **Waterline:** A line that is setup over water.

* **Rodeoline:** A line that is hung up on two relative high anchor points, with no tension in the line. The line draps between the two anchor points. Finding the balance point is difficult, because the line can swing out under your feet, throwing you off to one side.

-----------------------------------------
**Primitive line:**

There are a few ways to set up this kind of slackline. The tension is held by friction.

**3-carabiner method:** Instead of using an anchor on the non-tensioned side, you will thread your line through a fixed loop at one end of your line. This method is not recommended due to the negative affect it can have on your line (reduces break strength, more likely to fray your line).


[**4-carabiner method**](http://www.nwslackline.org/96/howto-setting-up-a-basic-primitive-slackline): This is one way to setup the basic ""primitive"" line. This method uses one carabiner on one anchor, and 3 on the tensioning side (two biners are clipped on to the other anchor).

[**Multiplier**](http://www.nwslackline.org/207/strength-of-3-men-for-only-20): This is a way to make pulling out the slack in your slackline easier. It's composed of pulleys, carabiner, and static rope. 

The multiplier can also be achieved using 2 extra carabiners. One biner will be clipped into the tension side anchor ([be sure to clip into the webbing like this]()), the other will be exactly where the pulley is in the video. Feed the lose end to the biner that is clipped to the anchor, then back to the other free biner. [Two biner multiplier will look like this.]()



-------------------------------------------
**Longline:**

Longlines require a pulleys system to tension the line. Tension is held by a brake at the end of the pulley system. 

**Method where the pulley system stays in the rig:**

**Softpointing:** The pulley system can be removed from the rig, leaving the line anchor to anchor. This will require a linegrip.

-------------------------
**Highline:**

----------------------------
**Trickline:**

---------------------------
**Waterline:**

------------------------------
**Rodeoline:**

--------------------------------------
**Other:**

4. I think I've tried a 2in Gibbon SL and did pretty well, would you recommend 1in or 2in line?

5. Would I just have to buy the recommended items on the sidebar (just with like 120ft of line) or since I have a longer line do I need different gear? 

6. Is it ok to use this 100ft line to make something smaller (like 25ft) sometimes? I'm thinking about taking this up to Canada in a couple weeks.

To start off, a pulley system is a much more efficient method to rig a slackline. You can use a pulley system to rig almost any line you want. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

[Balance Community](www.balancecommunity.com) has a great [guide on pulley systems](http://www.balancecommunity.com/Slack-Science/all-about-pulley-systems-the-complete-guide). If you are interested, please read through those SlackScience articles.

--------------------------------------------------

I recently built my own pulley system, and through a lot of Googling, I found some sites that sell components for much much much cheaper. And here is where I got all of my stuff:

**3"" SMC PMP double pulleys:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-Prusik-Minding-Pulley_p_712.html) sells those pulleys for about $95, just make sure you select double as your model. If you use the coupon code ""facebook1"", you can get an additional 10% off (not sure if coupon code still works).

**SMC Rigging Plate:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-NFPA-Rigging-Plate_p_683.html) sells them for about $40

**Shackles:** [Trek Adventure Gear](http://trekadventuregear.com/store/) sells 1/2"" Van Beest Green Pin shackles for $7 and ARB 3/4"" shackles for $11

**Brake:** Braking devies like GriGri/Petzl Rig/Petzl I'D are usually available used on Craig's List. You can always search for items at other locations have have them mail it to you. I was able to find a GriGri for 40 bucks, new. Try [AdHuntr](adhuntr.com) to search ALL of Craig's List.

**Static Rope:** I used Craig's List for that as well. Rope you HAVE to get new! Used ropes are NOT reliable because you don't know the history. Your best bet is to find people who are selling whole spools. Then you can keep some for yourself and sell the rest for a little profit.

**Spansets:** Check out [Manufacturer Express](mfrexpress.com).

**Quicklinks, Steelies, and misc. stuff:** Find friends who can get pro-deals. I got mine from CAMP-USA. Quicklinks you can get at most hard ware store or on manufacturer express, just make sure they are rated high enough.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, there is a facebook group called [SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/), and a group called [SlackChat: Used Gear Listing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/279618212103376/), where you can find some pretty good deals on used slackline rigging components. 



**Edit:** added spansets

**Edit 2:** Unless you have a lot of money ready to throw out, this process takes a good amount of time. I've spent months monitoring sites waiting for sales. You kinda have to buy a piece now and another later. Eventually, you'll have your own rig. 

List of items in my rig:

* SMC 3"" PMP double pulleys $85 x2

* SMC rigging plate $36

* Sterling SuperStatic 11.1mm Rope 200ft $0 (I bought a spool then sold the rest)

* Petzl I'D S $120

* Van Beest 1/2"" Shackle x3: $21

* ARB 3/4"" Shackle x1: $11

* CAMP Steel D biner x3: $40

* CAMP Lift Ascender: $35

* CAMP small mobile pulley ball bearing: $17

* Alpine Web Lock: $90

* 300 ft of Type-18: $198

* 1.23"" Steel ring x2: $13.50

* Green Spanset 3' x2: $15

* Green Spanset 10'x2: $30

With all of that said, I've been dying to highline for a while now and would love to get started. I know that the best way to learn in this sport is through first hand experience, and that's what I'm seeking with this post. I reside in upstate South Carolina (School), as well as coastal North Carolina (Home), but would be willing to travel to any border states (maybe farther) if necessary. What I'm mainly in search of is experience with highline(or even midline) gear, tensioning, and setup techniques so that I can one day (hopefully soon) invest in my own gear and start planning trips with friends (possibly even getting some sort of slacking program started at my University). I've learned a lot from various sites, including /r/slackline, but as I mentioned earlier I really would love some first hand experience.

Because of the small distance we normally rig, the ratchet system works fine and we can get a nice tight line. For my birthday I got myself a 100ft Perfect Tension line, and while I've found some good places to rig up a longer span, I can't seem to get a good tension on the PT line (IRONY!).

My goal is just to be able to get a 100ft span of nice tight 2"" line. We set up the PT line to the specifications in the instructions (2ft above the ground) and we were touching the ground in the middle... so clearly something is not right. If that's simply a limitation of the line itself... well I'm kinda disappointed. I figured my $130 would buy a nice tight 100ft span with the PT but it's far too loose in the middle for my taste.

I've seen some of the [more advanced rigs](http://i.imgur.com/wcJHL.jpg) here on /r/slackline, but I'm very intimidated coming into this new way to rig lines. Case in point:

[What the fuck is this?!](http://www.balancecommunity.com/images/shop/products/hardware/15-1-Pulley-System-Builder.jpg)


Question 1: Can anybody direct me to some good resources on the basics of ""primitive rigging""? I feel like the block and tackle rigs are intimidating and confusing to me because I don't understand the basics beyond a simple ratchet system yet.

Question 2: Will this different type of rigging be compatible with my existing lines? I would assume so, but I am not entirely sure right now.

**Tl;dr: Looking for resources on primitive rigging, as well as more advanced pulley and lock mechanism rigs.**

Edit: I found some great links on the balancecommunity.com website that I feel need to be linked from this thread:

How did you guys progress on longlines? How did it translate to water- and highlines?


I personally came into contact with slacklining around spring time in 2011. A restaurant offered free dessert for crossing their line, needless to say I was hooked.
So I bought a gibbon, walked it, learnt some static and dynamic tricks.

During winter the internet showed me what magnitude the sport had already taken and I bought, after months of consideration, the [""Sensei""](http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/de/shop/1-slackline-sets/32-master-serie/203-sensei-20-longline-set-100m) by Landcruising-Slacklines, that was in May last year.
I quickly reached ~50m but did not train too much after that.
This year however I put in an effort and within 5 weeks of slacklining ~4 times a week I reached the full 100m of the set."	t5_2rbhm	True

Some questions about their safety	StartsAsNewRedditor	9	1	19	"I've read so much stuff about how you shouldn't tension a line with a ratchet because they can fly apart, explode and other bad stuff. The thing is, I was curious enough to try and find some actual evidence of this, and honestly, I've found nothing but people talking about it. 

So is this a real thing, or is it really just something people in the slackline community throw around? And if so, can someone link me to some evidence?

Thanks.

Note: I'm not trying to offend anyone, or start a war about what is ""right"".

As far as I know, I have a bit of interest, so, feel free to swing on by, and bring anyone you want! I'll have some friends myself.

I've planned out a day of slacklining open to all on 6/22 at the Esplanade/Hatch. I will be there around noon, wearing a black Flobots shirt with white/blue plaid shorts. I'll also have a pretty noticeable Red/Orange/White beach towel. I will most likely be set up across the small tributary of the Charles, so not actually right by the stage. 

All skill levels will be welcome, as I'm not amazing myself. I will have at least one line, and I've been told others will also have a line. Feel free to bring your own. I will definitely have my kit containing two 12 foot anchors and 80 feet for the line, primitive 3 biner set up.

All the pros' use shoes- but i've always felt like my feet are ""blind"" when I wear shoes (since there is an extra layer between  the line and my foot). 

What shoes do you find work best?

I've been practicing turn arounds and trying to land a standing jump. Usually I have to bounce once or twice to get the right pop to get up and off the line... and I'll falter a little bit during this and not be able to execute the jump. A bunch of times I basically did a bouncing step-over... but I couldn't get myself up and off the line.
 
Today I had good standing balance... walked out to the middle... gave a one-two bounce and got completely off the line... came down and landed with both feet pretty straight and didn't fall off! I was prob only 1-2 inches off the line, but when your feet leave the line you **definitely** feel it! I was able to do it one more time before my break ended and I had to pack my stuff up and head back to work.

Can't wait to try this trick out on my long line... I'm sure I'll be able to get a little better bounce off it with a properly tightened (re: non-ratchet) line.

I admire those who are dedicated to this sport and willing to spend significant amounts of money on pushing themselves and this sport further.  I've learned a lot from these (you all, actually) guys over the past year or so.  Pussy white-flag waving disclaimer out of the way.


I generally try to buy the safest and best equipment when it comes to holding my line together.  But, when it was time to ditch the ratchet and start thinking about a multiplier... I didn't head to the local rock climbing store.  I went to Lowes, man.  Fkin' Lowes.  Kinda didn't take the WLL of the components in a multiplier setup seriously since they're generally not used to stay in place and hold the system taut.  But... still.  Lowes.


But Holy Hannah, they had everything I needed: [pic of pulley equipment for ghetto multiplier version 0.5a](http://i.minus.com/ib2neShNOmFaoZ.jpg)  Those were Blue Hawk 3/8"" Chain Swivel Pulleys (420lb WLL) at $5.98 each and the ""carabiner"" a Blue Hawk 5/8"" Chain Spring Link (WLL 1500lbs or so) for $3.29.  Don't ask why I have a chain link there.


Worked great for awhile, but the size of what they call a carabiner didn't have much real estate attached with the pulley to be ""girth hitched"" by the rope/tensioning webbing.  Today, I went to grab a slightly bigger ""chain link"" carabiner and [THESE JUST CAME IN!](http://i.minus.com/i1Mk8QBwsP5Ca.jpg)  Double frickin' pulleys (400lb WLL) for ten one dollar bills!  Gonna give these a try later this evening with my Jibline.


All kidding aside... I guess the point I'm trying to make is: there are some things that are safe to be frugal about but don't skim on anything that comes with your line, lockers, carabiners, anchors or whatever else is keeping you up in the air.  (and tree protection too, bastards better not be negelectin' on that.)

If you have a highline and would be interested in letting me walk it during that time, I would love to help set it up (I'm somewhat familiar with rigging) and am willing to pay you.

I can also sign any sort of liability waiver or pay under the table.

~~$28 for a 32kN [Fusion Double Pulley](http://www.code3tactical.com/fusion-fp-8155-pulley.aspx)~~ Update: Not worth getting cheap pulleys if you're committing to longline

$19 for a 40kN [Fusion Rigging Plate](http://www.code3tactical.com/fusion-fp-8144-2-rigging-plates.aspx)

~~and $22 for a 45kN [steel biner](http://www.code3tactical.com/fusion-fp-9001b-phs-aztez-hms-delta---steel.aspx)~~ Update: These are a poor shape biner to use on slack rigs.

These might not be strong enough for a super long line, but should be able to handle at least 100-300 feet. Anywhere I can do the calculations to see how long you could go with this equipment safely?

And - if anyone has found longline rigging equipment cheaper, please let me know!

Edit: It sounds like the moral of the story is go big (and safe) or go home and stay on a shorter primitive. Thanks to the good folks at r/slackline for helping discuss why budget-friendly isn't a good mentality for longline rigs.

After hearing it I've read a bit about how slacklining without tree padding could damage or kill the trees (http://www.nwslackline.org/45/tree-padding). 

So far I've been using towel tubes as tree padding, but it got me thinking about whether that was enough to really protect the trees. Does anyone have data on that? How can we be confident that the measures we take to protect the trees are effective?"	t5_2rbhm	True

1339679527.0	v1lax	First time Slacking yesterday, here's what I learned.	Sipes	13	7	4	"I bought a slackline from theclymb.com and it finally came in the mail the day before yesterday!  I broke it out for a test drive yesterday and it was wonderful.  I began by not being able to stand on it at all, to walking the entire length of the setup in about 3 hr. (not a solid 3 hours on the line, but three hours of being around the slackline.)

Here is how I did it.

* I started out by watching a few [youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TzERkdNoyw).  First I practiced balancing on my dominant foot in the middle of the line. It was seemingly impossible to do this but after a good ten min of hopping my left leg up a bout 1/2""-1"" my dominant leg got the hint of what it was supposed to be doing.  All the while I was holding my elbows in the air by my ears like that guy in the video said.  I could only stand on it for a blink of an eye before falling off, this happened for the first 10 minutes or so.

Then I could balance for a second, then 3, then 10!  For the next 40-50 min, I tried to balance longer and longer and then get my left foot on in order to switch.  I got tired of failing and so went to grab a beer and a burger, never did get my left foot on.

After my beer and burger I went to a slackline meetup at Patterson Park in Baltimore!  There I met a few others who have been slackling for a while.  I learned some awesome tips from them and tried out a few other kinds of lines (primitive, trick, and a super long one).  After two hours of hanging with these guys I was able to walk the entire distance of my classic line!  Here are some tips I learned from the other guys, I believe is they're the reason I was able to walk the line in one day.  

* Pick a point on the tree to focus on. (about eye level)
* Breath

As funny as it sounds those two tips are probably the most groundbreaking info for slacking I received.  Hope this helps, and have a blast.

1366989470.0	1d5ou3	RE minis and brake. Need advice.	steikepanne	6	0	7	"Hi everyone,

I bought my first pulley system last year, the ninja pulley system from Landcruising with 70m WM. I haven't walked the whole length yet, but I am about 40 meter at the moment and I am pretty confident I will be walking the whole length in the end of the season.

So there is a few things I have been thinking about especially regarding the brake placement. In the normal setup the brake is connected to the becket of the pulley with a 8mm quick link, this makes it easy to release tension because the handle is free to rotate however it definitely put quite a bit of friction on the strands of the rope.

So I have been thinking of getting a rigging plate to avoid this however it will add a bit of weight/cost/complexity to the system. A rigging plate like the DMM bat plate S will work without a twist shackle. Even smaller rigging plates will probably work with a twist shackle in most cases. What do you guys think? Rigging plates seems to be kind of outdated and not that many people are using them anymore especially with the SMC 3"", however with the RE minis there is a lot less space and the will be friction with both horizontal and vertical orientation when used in the embedded position.

Another option is using another sling with the brake. This is cheaper and I already got the gear. All you need is a homemade sling of 1"" tubular and a 8mm bow shackle and your good to go. This makes things more flexible is cheaper but requires more gear than embedded position and is a bit more cumbersome in my opinion.


So what I am asking is how do you connect the brake when using a lightweight pulley system (RE minis, micro smc) ? And do you guys think the friction the imbedded brake introduces have a big impact on how easy it is to tighten the line?


Also at last one more thing. I am using these adjustable slings: (http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/en/shop/23-schlingen/302-st-baumschlinge-verstellbar) and they are the ones the comes with the kit. The break strength is about 30-35 kn and they are adjustable which is great, however they are a lot weaker than span sets. What do you think guys, would you use these slings with the RE minis?

Recently, however, it will sometimes slip and fall to the ground. This is annoying and probably dangerous ( I'm always slacking a few feet over grass, so I'm not too worried). The end of the line that is held by friction just seems to slip out from under the line, and it will lose tension and I will fall to the ground. This usually happens after some bouncing, but nothing crazy like trick lining. The line has some wear to it, but I'd hate to think my line had already degraded this far and that I need a new one. Should I get more rigging, maybe a pulley system that's tied off and secure to combat this? Any thoughts, ideas? Thanks	t5_2rbhm	True

I also took up slacklining during one of The Clymb's Gibbon sales, and was happily setting up my line all over campus until the campus police asked me to stop. They seemed more confused than anything, and cited potential liability issues, along with potential damage to the trees, and asked us to just not set it up on campus. The officer did, however, mention that if we cared, we could contact the administration and get someone to give it the OK.

I'm up to that step now, but before I send off an email, I wanted to gather some materials that demonstrate primarily that setting up a line, when done properly, can be perfectly safe for trees. I found this:
http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/slacklining.htm

1344923264.0	y6tsk	Modified Primitive, Give me feedback	cerealdaemon	6	0	5	"So I was experimenting with some different setups for a primitive 1"" slackline and I think i came up with something thats maybe slightly too convuluted, but seemed to work extremely well. The fixed anchor end is a basket with a rigging ring, but its not shown. 

http://i.imgur.com/mZzAh.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/iSQic.jpg
This second picture shows the yellow tension webbing doing its thing. The top carabiner is attached to the line by means of a dressed girth hitch. I know how this degrades the strength of the webbing. Rather than use a simple single biner as the friction point, I spread this out over two seperate ones to simulate the action of a pulley.

http://i.imgur.com/E8JKZ.jpg 

This image shows the complete setup. You might have noticed that on the purple webbing, I am using the spine of a carabiner in the same way that a rigging ring might be used. This should be OK. This is not crossloading the biner, nor is it loading it along the axis of the spine, its simply using the diameter of the biner body as a weblock. 

So there it is, a modified primitive setup. This was noticibly easier for one person to tension, due to the pulley action of the webbing through the biners, but it is significantly more gear intensive to setup. I have all this gear, so it wasn't a big deal for me, but might be for you if you want to replicate this and don't have 4 piece of webbing, about 8 carabiners, rigging rings and other various accoutrement"	t5_2rbhm	True

I was visiting my parents last night, and I spotted a great area to slack, but only one side has a tree on it. The other side of the back yard has a MASSIVE rock, larger than a schoolbus... it's not going anywhere. If I were able to embed a [""climbing eye bolt""](http://acmeclimbing.com/fixestainlesssteelglueineyebolt.aspx)? it will be a great spot to rig my 100ft line.

I'm not familiar at all with these devices, what I do understand is that I'll have to drill a hole into the rock... put some special epoxy/glue in there, insert the eye bolt, and then wait a period of time for the glue to cure. I already have a drill that's suitable for putting holes in a rock, so that's not a problem. My main concern is the working load limit of the adhesive and installing it properly... I know my line gets up to easily 2500lbs force and I'm worried that I'll rip the eye bolt out of the rock at some point.

I've been a member of this community for a while, and have been slacklining for almost a year now. I built my own 1"" primitive setup and I love it more than anything. I'm able to do a handful of static tricks (knee and double knee drops, front elbow levers etc..) However, I really want to get into more acrobatic tricks. 

From here I know that my options are:

* [Gibbon Jibline/Surfline](http://www.amazon.com/Gibbon-GIJL1015-Slacklines-15M-Jibline/dp/B001RCMR2E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339987594&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gibbon+jibline)

* [Perfect Tension Performance Line/Pro Line](http://www.perfecttension.com/#/shop/4560836923)

* [Balance Community Rage Line](http://www.balancecommunity.com/RAGEline)

I'm leaning towards the PT or Gibbon side, since the rage line would require me also building a pulley setup (too poor for that).


 I'm aware of how much ratchets suck, and have considered using the method that adam from NW Slackline outlines for tensioning a 2inch line with a primitive setup. I have a concern with this, as well. Would a primitive tensioning system hold up from the rapid dynamic load of a trickline? I once tried doing some butt bounces on my 1"" setup, and my tension came out after only a few jumps.

If that was just a coincidence and the primitive will hold up, then I would definitely drop the extra few bucks on the larger rap rings and the extra webbing to use the primitive setup for my 2"".


So, Gibbon or Perfect Tension?

I am the founder of a new slacklining club at my university and want to know what I can do to promote slacklining to students on campus.	r0xxclimb3r	6	3	13	"So what I'm looking for is suggestions on anything you guys think would be good for me to do to promote slacklining on campus while being able to teach people the proper and safe way to slackline. Basically, I want to know what kind of things you would you would do if you were starting your own collegiate slackline club. Anything from advice on how to teach new members to walk the line to events on campus to how to arrange meetups with other collegiate clubs or how to receive funding and/or gear donations (which are desperately needed!!) would be helpful. 

Speaking of funding, as a student organization we have to go through our student senate to receive funds and since this sport is viewed as 'a potential liability to student safety' things have been a bit difficult to gather enough funds to buy the club some good lines. There are a few of us who have our own lines to use but that brings a lot of wear and tear to personal equipment and as poor college students it gets a bit costly. So, if any of you know people and/or companies who would be willing to help out a startup club of slackliners, we would all really appreciate your help!!

Yesterday, I started to lose balance, so I stepped off and my pinkie toe lagged behind a bit, and was subsequently broken (now I know why there are shoes warnings).  Just a warning to other beginners that shoes might be smart until you're more comfortable with the line (but I'd like to hear if anyone else has had any similar injuries).

I was hanging out with friends at the gym and wanted to setup the line.  The anchors didnt fit and on accident i unknotted one which got me thinking of different ways to setup when your current equipment doesnt meet your needs.

Heres what I did.

Untied both of the anchors, so they're back to being 12.5' (now length) and affixed biners to them, two on one side, one on the other using a slip knot (i think).  The biners stayed locked and then we tied the webbing around the pillars and secured them using a bow knot (common shoelace knot) which tightens as its pulled on.  At that point the anchors were locked in so I setup the line as normal.  

I was a bit worried that the anchors would come loose, but we kept it up for about 2 hours without any trouble which was great because I was able to get two new people to try it out.

Anyone else have an interesting method or story?  

FWIW I only thought of using a slip knot because of one of the other recent threads with pictures and my brain pulled that one out as useful at the time, which it was.

After seeing a few people with them on previous camping trips and watching videos of the sport I decided to buy a Slackline during REI's Memorial Day Sale and give it a shot the next time I went out.

This past weekend I finally made it out to the wilderness with some friends and we set the line up and we discovered rather quickly how much fun and challenging this thing can be.  One thing I noticed while setting up was that my line, no matter how well i tried to line up the anchor points would eventually pull to one side of the ratchet and begin rubbing on the metal housing.  No matter what my friends and i tried we couldn't prevent this strap from slipping over to the left side(facing the ratchet side anchor from the center) which would then cause it to slightly fray at the edges a bit.  

Is this a normal occurrence?  Have i just destroyed my slackline on it's first use?  Do you guys have any tips to help me prevent this alignment issue and future wear on the strap?

Anchor Slings

Gemtor anchor slings provide an OSHA-compliant anchor point when attached to a structural support capable of supporting at least 5,000 lbs. The anchor slings are made of 1 3/4"" wide nylon webbing (polyester is also available) with a 3"" wide wear pad to protect against abrasion.

We set it up between two trees about 25 paces apart (about 20m I believe) and thing comes with a monster size ratchet but even so, I wasn't able (or brave enough) to tension it enough to hold my weight at the centre of the line. I weigh only about 60kg (135llbs). Initially I had it set up at the only height recommended by Gibbon which is 50cm. We raised that to about 1m but still the sag was enough that we were touching the ground when walking to the middle.

What are your recommendations for lines of this length? How tight should the line be? How big should the sag be on a 30m line? Should I go past the recommended 2.5x turns of the ratchet to up the tension, or should I set the line up even higher? Also, how does this change when using a 1inch primitive set up, does a thinner line usually require more or less tension?

I've been getting some good use out of my PTEN pro line, but I'm starting to notice some small abrasions in the line. These slacklines do not last forever, so I'm starting to research what my next line is going to be. Originally, I was just going to get myself a Gibbon Surfline, but I'm starting to get better at walking longer distances so I'm investigating 1"" and 1.25"" lines. 

The question now is whether I should go for a standard 1"" line, or shell out for the pricier but bouncier 1.25"" RageLine. I really like the bouncing and dynamic nature of the Jib &amp; PTEN Pro lines that I have... so I'm not sure how much I'll like regular 1"" webbing.

Does anybody have any experience with the RageLine? How does it compare to a 2"" line? The rounded edges look nice, I think that in itself will be an upgrade over the 2"" lines that I'm using. The RageLine also looks to have a much higher WLL, which is good because I like my lines nice and tight.

I think I'm going to get about 250ft of it if I go that route, so I really want to make sure it's something I'm going to enjoy before I plunk down a serious chunk of change. I really wish someone around me (Northern NJ) had some I could try! PM me if you do!"	t5_2rbhm	True

I was allowed to bring one small trunk of ed materials on the plane, and I included a slackline.  Problem is, and I'm feeling pretty dumb for it, is that I'm basically on the tundra with only shrubby closely-clumped alders (I was told there were ""trees"".  NOPE).  I've even looked at the telephone/power poles but none of them seem to be situated correctly.  I have a Gibbon (yeah, BOOO, I know right?) 30m.  My question is -- how else can I utilize this slackline, which took up precious room in my ed materials tote, for other activities with kids?

If I don't reply to you immediately, it's because internet access is super spotty out here.  I'm lucky to have it at all.

1341970594.0	wd0eu	Using big rocks instead of trees for anchors?	jbjorge	4	1	5	So I've been wanting to set up a jibline in my backyard for easy access, but I have no trees. I know A-frames and digging holes is an option, but I was wondering if another option is possible. I have a bunch of very large granite landscaping rocks, and I was thinking it could be possible to rig my line around them. I have fairly limited knowledge about tension forces and what not so I was hoping someone would know here. Each rock weighs at least 600 lbs (this is an underestimate) for caution reasons. The line would be about 20-30 feet long, and I'd be using a gibbon jibline primarily also maybe my primitive setup.	t5_2rbhm	True

Around the time of the line breaking, I experienced some terrible lower-back pain. I figured it didn't have to do with slacklining since it just started hurting after 2 months of doing it and not 2 days. I went to the doctor because it got pretty bad, but he gave me the typical ""take some Advil and come back if it doesn't stop"" advice (I'm 17 by the way, so it's not an age thing).

I got a new slackline after about a month of not having one, and after the first day of having it, I experienced the same pain, so I'm pretty positive it's the slacklining causing this pain.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this pain, and if so, how they prevented it, like certain stretches or workouts. 

I'm not the most fit person in the world but I'm not really out of shape or anything, and I don't do anything too extreme on it, just trying to stay on it longer, walk further, etc. I land on my feet pretty much all the time too and the slackline is only between waist and knee height, so it's not that kind of thing. Anyway, please help! I love slacklining, and I don't want this to prevent me from doing it. 

TL;DR Lower back hurts, positive it's from slacklining. Not doing anything extreme. 17 years old. Not that out of shape. Need advice (Stretches, workouts, etc.)

I didn't realize how much I'd end up liking slacklining and have been playing on it almost all my spare time. I can walk it, turn, walk it again pretty consistently. Been learning some basic tricks too.

Last week, I got to try a gibbon surfline for the first time. Super fun and setup at near full length. Its like a whole new challenge, on a stretchier longer line. I want to buy one from the Clymb while its on sale, but don't really have the 80 bucks to spare. 

Has anyone tried just running a long 1"" webbing from an anchor through this gibbon classic ratchet? Seems like its the cheapest route to a longer line if it would be a safe setup (admittedly a ghetto frankenstein of a line)

Would appreciate any advice on the matter."	t5_2rbhm	True

I'm from Santiago, Chile (excuse my bad english) and I'm currently trying my best to learn how to do the jumping tricks on the slackline, I've been mostly doing yoga/sitting/walking in the slackline since I began (about 6 months ago) and I can only do the vertical jump

I have 2 questions: I have a gibbon classic (the yellow one) and since over here slacklines are quite expensive I decided to ask you, whats the best slackline out there to start doing butt bounce and those kinds of tricks?

my other question is: does anybody else like to slackline using vibram fivefingers? it's awesome :D"	t5_2rbhm	True
1343440313.0	xa2g6	Re: our AMA	PTENPTEN	16	14	7	"Ok you big reddit jerks :).. we’re not lawyers.. we just want you to be safe... WE PROVIDE A MAXIMUM TENSION OF 6500lbs. Which is less than our actual breaking strength and stitch pattern break strength. 

In addition to this we have dyno’d what our ratchets can do and know  that our ratchets will never get anywhere near this max tension. (However, our ratchets provide more than enough of torque for tricklining which is our only actual goal!!! ) ***
The reason there is such a big gap from what our ratchets can do(3000lbs if you’re the hulk) and the real limit, is because we do not want people pushing the envelope with pulley systems. 99% of slackliners have very little knowledge about how much force they are exerting on the webbing (Dyno’s are expensive).  JUST USE COMMON SENSE. (we know that pulleys may not lead to as much abrasion) JUST USE COMMON SENSE. WE PROVIDE A MAXIMUM TENSION OF 6500lbs. webbing degrades over time, due to a number of things including but not limited to- sunlight, heat, abrasion, dust, germs, silly string, tea, smiles, unicorn hair.. basically the stuff is degrades over time...   

We think that any company that provides actual breaking strength is taking an enormous risk. Once that webbing leaves the loom it IS going to degrade. The break strengths can vary. Even Mil spec will vary by whatever amount of standard deviations are acceptable to that particular webbing... 

***everyone has complaints about ratchets and we understand. They are dangerous. This is why we explain proper use in our warning booklet. Once you understand how the ratchet works the risk of injury will decrease significantly.  

Hope that answers any unanswered questions!

1343005655.0	wzped	Jumping [question]	nspyder	3	0	3	So I recently started slacklining about a month ago, and I got a Gibbon Classic (yea I know, not really meant for big tricks and jumping), and I can easily walk across it. I've just been working on doing a vertical jump for awhile and can't seem to get it. I can get in the air, but when I come down and land on it, I fall off within seconds (I land with my feet sideways). Should I be wearing shoes when doing this? Should I learn how to walk across the line sideways first? Any tips guys?	t5_2rbhm	True

1341683178.0	w6obj	n00b has a couple of questions!	redbike1	3	0	11	"Hey guys, I'm really wanting to get into slacklining, but I have some questions. I really want to be able to slackline at my house, but I'm not sure if I have enough space. Corner to corner in my backyard is only about 30ft. If I go along my side yard, I have about 75ft. BUT, I don't have any trees or anything to anchor a slackline to and the side yard isn't very wide.

Are either of these spaces long enough? How can I easily anchor the lines without a tree? I know I can put a post into the ground, but I wouldn't be able to do that in the front yard (if I ran the line through my side yard). I would need something that can be removed, hidden, or aesthetically pleasing... 

Any help would be appreciated!"	t5_2rbhm	True

I own a gibbon jibline and have been using it with much fun and success. However, as mentioned (repeatedly!) here on r/slackline, the ratchet seems to be eating up the line, despite my great attempts at caution in feeding the line straight through the ratchet. Is there a way I can setup the line without using the provided ratchet? Can I adapt the primitive setup and use this gibbon line instead? Or does the width of the gibbon need some adaptation? It would be a shame to waste this line! Thanks"	t5_2rbhm	True

JCurry2	4	1	9	"So just got kicked out of the park by some bylaw officers in my city and wanted to ask people some questions. The problem I have in my city is that in the parks bylaw it is illegal to affix anything to a tree. I show the officers that I'm choosing the proper size tree and even using line protection and they understand and regretfully have to still kick me out. I've asked the bylaw department for an excemption permit and even ""tweeted"" our mayor (our mayor is hip) but still waiting to hear back.

Has anyone had success in their location getting a fair-use policy for slacklining? And how did you go about doing it?

How are the interactions with your bylaw officers?
