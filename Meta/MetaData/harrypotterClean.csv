They are trying to get past the Whomping Willow to sneak through the secret passage. I read this part:

&gt; Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow's swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its thick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath she could not speak.

&gt; ""How -- how're we going to get in?"" panted Ron. ""I can -- see the place -- if we just had -- Crookshanks again --""

&gt; ""Crookshanks?"" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. *""Are you a wizard, or what?""*

&gt; ""Oh -- right -- yeah --""

&gt; Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and said, *""Wingardium Leviosa!""* ...

This seemed really familiar, so I went back to the first book, to chapter 16 when the three of them have just passed Fluffy and landed on the Devil's Snare. Hermione escaped, but Harry and Ron are being strangled.

&gt; ""Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!"" said Hermione.

&gt; ""Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!"" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.

&gt; ""Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp --""

&gt; ""So light a fire!"" Harry choked.

&gt; ""Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!"" Hermione cried, wringing her hands.

&gt; ""HAVE YOU GONE MAD?"" Ron bellowed ""ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?""

&gt; ""Oh, right!"" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand ...

I just thought it was wonderful how JKR put that into the last book, a scene that's so similar to one from the first book it's like a little flashback. And I love how even though I've read this book a million times, I'm still finding things like that every time."	t5_2qiqi	True

1362755279.0	19wx07	A quote to remember her by.	caput_draconus	1746	449	66	"I introduced my mother to the Harry Potter series as something to keep her occupied while she was in her chemotherapy treatments a few years back. I was on my second readthrough at the time and she had noticed that I was always reading them so she asked if she could borrow them and see what the commotion was all about. Within a couple of days she had already passed me up and had the series finished a few days after that. She was in LOVE with it.

Since I had returned from college, we had tried to find some common ground and this definitely gave us that connection. We would have marathons occasionally and I would invite my very good friend (Let's call her Beth) over and just make a day of it. We all had an absolute blast. 

Fast forward to about a year and a half ago, her condition deteriorated pretty rapidly and we all knew the end was near, so while she was in hospice, we had one last marathon but unfortunately she had never been able to make it to the theater to see DH:part 2 and this was before it came out to dvd so we did our best to describe everything to her, explaining our likes and dislikes and how the movie differed from the book.

She passed a couple of days later and as any self respecting momma's boy would, I was having a pretty hard time with it. My friend Beth knew that I was having some trouble coping with the enormity of the situation and she sent me just one message. It was a quote, spoken by Remus in POA:

""Yes, I knew her. You mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others, even, and perhaps most especially, when that person couldn't see it in themselves.""

All I could manage was a very sincere ""Thank You"" But that quote latched onto me and as more and more people would come to me with stories about how my mom had helped them out when nobody else would it just filled me up with such joy and optimism that my mom not only had a great deal of influence on making me who I am today but she had such a positive influence on everybody she meets. She was the embodiment of Lily.

The Harry Potter series is full of quotes that can have a profound effect on people, even when it seems like the world has come to a halt. This quote has become by far my favorite of the series simply due to the fact that it helped me realize that even if someone is gone, their legacy still remains. And my mom's legacy was a great one.

OK wall of text over. Thanks for reading!

EDIT: Wow, I didn't really know what to expect after typing this up this morning. After a few months of lurking, I thought that r/harrypotter might appreciate what not just this quote, but what the whole series had done to bring my mother and I together and you all certainly did not disappoint. It gets me right in the feels. So a million more times, thank you!"	t5_2qiqi	True

From the Official [Universal Orlando Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/UniversalOrlandoResort?fref=ts) page:

THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES: THE WIZARDING WORLD OF HARRY POTTER – DIAGON ALLEY IS COMING TO UNIVERSAL ORLANDO RESORT. 

Building on the global phenomenon that is The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Universal Orlando Resort and Warner Bros. Entertainment today announced an expansion of historic proportion with the entirely new themed environment, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley.

Scheduled to open in 2014, the world’s first centrally themed, multi-park experience expands The Wizarding World of Harry Potter across both Universal Orlando theme parks and allows Universal’s creative team to bring an unparalleled vision to this unique project. The new area will bring to life some of the experiences and places found in and around London in the Harry Potter books and films, offering brand-new adventures for fans and theme park guests from around the world. 

Diagon Alley and ‘London’ will be located within the Universal Studios Florida theme park, which is adjacent to Universal’s Islands of Adventure theme park, where guests now experience Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. The new area within Universal Studios will be just as expansive, immersive and authentic as the existing themed environment.”

Confirmed Thus Far:


* Diagon Alley Expansion (Opening 2014)

* New Themed Restaurant

* Gringotts Bank Themed Attraction

* Travel between both Wizarding Worlds via Hogwarts Express w/2 Park ticket"	t5_2qiqi	True

Think about it, they'd already kissed before but they say there's something different about this time in the book. I think the thing she was going to give him to remember her by, was her virginity."	t5_2qiqi	True

It could follow in the footsteps of Game of Thrones where each chapter or two could be an hour long episode, and by the end of the season you would have a whole book. If the budget was good I think it could really live up to how good the books were. Think of all the great things missing from the movies that could be explored and how in depth we could get to know the characters.  Also the sheer amount of footage! It would be great to have ~15 hours dedicated to each book instead of a couple hours.

1354556744.0	147k28	Why I hate Severus Snape.	MacGreensomething	1615	646	684	"So I know that Snape tends to be a very controversial character. His overall story arc is meant to teach people that bad deeds in your past don't necessarily make you a bad person. ... But here's my counterargument: the guy was an asshole.

Seriously, I think what Snape actually teaches us that doing one good thing but being an overall horrible person does not necessarily make you a good person. 

Even if we disregard how awful he was to Harry (because after all, Harry *did* look just like James, who Snape hated for ""stealing"" Lily away) Snape was awful to EVERYONE. 

He was basically a racist bully, who pouted his entire adult life because the girl he was in love with didn't pick him. 

Yes, he was brave in his work with the Order/being a double agent, but that doesn't necessarily make him a good person, it just makes him a brave one.

I was always ridiculously upset that Harry partially named one of his kids after Snape.  I understand it was meant to be a nod to how much Snape went through over the years, but come on. Snape was an absolutely asshat to Harry literally every single chance he got.  The best you can say is that Snape tried to stop people from killing Harry. That's it. 

Compare it to like... a cop who is an emotionally abusive husband/father.  You would feel bad calling him an asshole because he's a cop and out catching criminals.  But if you saw him in his home-environment you would hate him and realize that he's a total jackass. That's how I view Snape. 

I think Snape was a terrible person and just because he was brave and did some good things, that doesn't necessarily mean he was an overall good person.

TL;DR: I hate Snape because he was an asshole to most every character throughout the entire series.  Just because he was heroic at the end does not mean he was actually good.  Doing one good deed does not make you a good person. 

*EDIT: Clarification: I actually LOVE that Snape is an imperfect character. I really enjoy his character in the books and I think he's written perfectly. What I hate, however, is the ""person,"" if that makes sense.*


**EDIT 2: @Meninthemirror made a very good point: ""As As far as I can tell, none of the responses below address the fact that Snape spent years as a Death Eater before becoming a double agent.
I think any honest reckoning of his deeds has to include the several years he spent torturing and killing innocent people and Muggles.""**

Now on this list will be scenes that were not in the movies at all. Things like having a scene from the book but not doing it like the book ""to the t"" will not make my list. I am talking about WHOLE chucks from the book that they felt didn't need to be in the movie.

#5 Vernon Dursley's very odd day at work
Why the movie starts at the night Dumbledore drops off Harry isn't a bad start. I just feel as it is the beginning why not start from the BEGINNING. Also Dursley's day is so odd and crazy it just makes me laugh every time I read it

#4 Visiting st. Mungo's
How can you not love this and want to see this in the movie. You would have seen great scene work for Matthew Lewis and most importantly get to see Kenneth Branagh bring back one of my favorite bit characters of the series. Sadly to do the scene right it would have taken like 20 mins of unneeded time.

#3 Mcgonagall &amp; Umbridge fighting during Harry's O.W.L. meeting
This scene is one of my favorites of the book. It really isn't an important scene for plot points but seeing that Maggie Smith and Imelda Staunton are so perfect for the two roles they played in the movies it would have just been a delight to see these fine actresses in this scene

#2 Lupin and Harry fight and Grimmauld Place
This is such a heartbreaking scene in hindsight cause basically Harry tells Lupin not to run away and fight for his family and then Lupin ends up dying. It is easily in my top ten favorite parts of the whole series and I would have loved to see it on the big screen

#1 EVERYTHING THAT PEEVES SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN
No shock that this is number 1. One of the most beloved characters of Harry Potter is not seen in the movies at all. Such a crime could have been some great comedic acting for some lucky brit but alas the movie guys thought having him would just be a waste of time.

What is your guys top 5? and if Peeves was in the movies what actor do you think should have played him? I am going with CGI character with David Tennant as the voice or hell Jim Dale would be perfect."	t5_2qiqi	True

and as I'm helping the Kid about 9ish is running around saying ""Wingardium Leviosa."" at this point I notice his jumper has the Gryffindor badge on it and he has a small stick in his hand.
We pack up the pram then me and the woman are chatting mid way through our conversion the kid pipes up ""What's your name?"" I pause for a second then look back at him and say ""Tom Riddle."" 
His face explodes with excitement he then pulls up his stick and points it right at me and screams ""Avada Kedavra!"" I throw myself into the back of the bus stop and slump into one of the seats, his mum starts laughing her head off and the kid dances round in happiness, I open my eyes and his face was priceless.

1372767734.0	1hhqno	My theory about the GoF 'plot hole'	nayimhittingalongone	1102	197	279	"I've had this on my mind for years, always meaning to write it down somewhere, so here we go.

First of all, I'd like to point out an interview of JKR's from years ago.  (Taken from partway down [this](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/gf/book_gf.html) page)

&gt;Q: You mentioned something in a recent interview about a flaw in Book 4...

&gt;A: Did I? Oh yes. . .I repaired it! This is why Book 4 nearly caused me a nervous breakdown - because for the first time ever I lost my careful plot - which I've had since 1994, I think. I really should have gone through it with a fine toothcomb before I started writing and I didn't. I had a false sense of security because all my other plans had held up so well. So I sailed straight into the writing of Four, having just finished Azkaban. I had written what I thought at the time was half the book - it turns out now to have been about a third of the book - and I realised there was this big hole in the middle of the plot and I had to go back and unpick and redo. That's part of the reason it's longer than I thought it was going to be.

&gt;Q: Can you say what the flaw was, or would that spoil things ?

&gt;A: No, because that would ruin it. 


Secondly, looking at [this](http://www.jkrfan.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=1002&amp;fullsize=1) page of note jottings that was from JKR's old website, it seems like Peter Pettigrew was originally going to be disguised as Moody, rather than Barty Crouch Jr.

I hypothesise that this was the plot hole as Harry would have presumably noticed quickly enough with the Marauder's Map.  JKR has said a few times (possibly on Pottermore) that the Map has caused her many problems and that she regrets Harry having it so much.

I think Barty Crouch Jr only became a character to solve this problem (by creating the furore around Barty Crouch Sr).  To me it always seemed a bit contrived that he had secretly been kept captive for 10+ years.

**tl;dr Barty Crouch Jr was never meant to be a character, as Pettigrew was originally going to be the DADA teacher**

Having written this, I'm starting to doubt it a bit.  The problem could have been solved by taking the Marauder's Map away from Harry (like it was) only earlier.

I dunno, do you have any other theories for what the plot hole could have been?"	t5_2qiqi	True

She plans to 'stagger through' the final Harry Potter film, The Deathly Hallows, but said she was not sure what would happen to her career after that.
Recalling the making of the movie, the actress told The Times: 'I wasn’t well during filming. I had shingles. On my head.
'I have never known anything so painful. I had to wear a wig for the role so it was a nightmare.
'One doctor told me I had been bitten by a wasp. I didn’t think that sounded right. I was in such pain. I was screaming and doing a lot of crying.
'They give you masses of pills, but nothing touches it. Now it’s just itchy.'""

He looks and acts like James, but the way he sees people is more like Lily. He looks for the best in people (save for the slytherins) and treats them with kindness, except for when his temper flares. Lupin said in PoA (movie, not book) that Lily ""had a way of seeing the best in everyone, even if they themselves could not see it.""

The Weasleys and Lovegoods are from Devon which is 220+ mi from London. Malfoys from Wiltshire, some 100 mi from London. Harry is the only one who lives close to London (Surrey).

Also what about people like Seamus. It doesn't even make sense for him to come to London and then go back (sort of) the way he came to Ireland. 

Also how do the Weasleys, Malfoys, Seamus travel home from Kings Cross? Do they walk into a secluded alley (or may be even Diagon Alley or some magical place in London) or something and disapparate/portkey out of there? 

If so why doesn't Hogwarts just allow the parents to pick up the kids and portkey/floo/apparate out from say Hogsmede or just outside the school gates/outside the non-apparation enchantment zone or something like that?

1362501359.0	19pp4i	Some interesting things I've learned about a few spells.	mikaelaryan	1068	277	206	"So, as a classics major, I am currently in the process of learning Latin. J.K. Rowling also has a background in Classics and a lot of people know that a lot of her spells are Latin based. So, it's been super interesting, while learning Latin, to learn some of the words that make up these spells and to realize what a genius she really is. I thought I'd share a few that I've learned so far with you guys.

1. The spell periculum is used to shoot red sparks out of your wand. This was used in the Goblet of Fire during the maze task to alert the officials that the competitor was in danger. The word ""periculum"", in Latin, is actually a noun that means ""danger or risk"".

2. The spell expecto patronum is used to generate a patronus, which wards off dementors. The verb ""expecto"", in Latin, means ""to wait for, expect, await"". The noun ""patronus"" means ""a protector or patron"". So, literally, ""expecto patronum"" means ""I am awaiting a protector"".

3. The spell expelliarmus is used to disarm an opponent. It comes from the verb ""expello"", which, in Latin, means ""to drive out, expel, banish"". When you use expelliarmus, you are basically driving someone's wand out of their hand.

4. The spell oppugno is used by Hermione in the Half Blood Prince to attack Ron with the birds she has conjured. The jinx is used to direct an object to attack a victim. The verb ""oppugno"", in Latin, means ""to attack or assault"". 

These are all the ones that I've learned so far. I'm not finished learning Latin though, so I'm sure there will be plenty more to come. I hope you guys enjoyed this as much as I did!

EDIT: I was, in fact, already aware that the spells are pretty much all derived from Latin before I began learning Latin. It's just exciting to me to think about the spells and their background meanings as I'm learning the language rather than because I looked them up online, hence, my reasoning for this post. :)"	t5_2qiqi	True

1349988328.0	11bujy	I think it's time we try that Harry Potter cast AMA campaign again...	bakersdozen13	936	177	94	"Those of you who have been around for a while may remember my request last year to try to get a member of [the Harry Potter cast to do an AMA on reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/ijdok/how_we_might_be_able_to_get_a_cast_member_to_do/)

We narrowed it down to a few actors and made a valiant effort on Twitter. But, alas, our numbers were too small and our voices were not heard.

I believe we should try this again, for two reasons:

**1. We are considerably bigger now.** When we first tried this, there were around 3,000 people on this sub. We're at nearly 65,000 now. Our social media ""army"" would have much more of an impact now.

**2. The Harry Potter frenzy has calmed down a bit.** When we first tried this, it was July 7, 2011 - right before the final movie was released. The cast was up to its ears in interviews and tours and promotions. Now that it's been a while, I am sure their lives have settled down a bit and they'd have more time to dedicate to this.

These are the Twitter handles I know. Feel free to add more and I'll edit as names come in.

1354823490.0	14eei7	The moment Sirius Black broke my heart, and a discussion question. 	Dftbashley	926	181	240	"When reading the series, I was never a Sirius Black fan. I loved his scenes in PoA, but his sudden appearance in GoF and his rashness in OotP made me frustrated, sometimes even angry. I know that Sirius spent twelve years in solitary confinement, but he always seemed more intent on reliving his glory days with James through Harry than becoming the father figure that Harry might have needed him to be. 


Then, one night a few months ago, I was thinking about Harry Potter before going to bed (don't we all?). I thought about book one, and how Sirius had given Hagrid his bike before he went to find Peter. Again, I was overcome with frustration, why couldn't Sirius just be PATIENT for once, why can't he just be an adult for once, Harry needed him to be. 


But then, I realized something myself. Sirius tried to take Harry away from Hagrid, but Hagrid refused. I think that in that moment, Sirius knew. Being Harry's godfather, he should have had no issue at all taking custody of his best friend's son, but Hagrid had been given strict instructions to bring him directly to the headmaster. Not even Dumbledore believed him to be innocent. The only people alive apart from himself who could verify that Peter was the secret keeper was Peter, and Sirius knew at that moment that he would most likely not find Peter/not survive a fight with Peter's new Death Eater friends. He was thrown in Azkaban at a young age with only the idea that he was innocent, and kept there for twelve years. By the time he escaped, he was an adult with no idea how to be an adult. The moment he gave his most prized bike to Hagrid, I think he also gave away the hope that he and Harry could rebuild a life together, that everything might be okay eventually. When he and Harry united again, I don't think that he really knew how to be a person anymore, let alone a parental figure for a young teenager. 


I'm planning to re-read the series again shortly, and I'm curious how my new perception of Sirus will effect it. Have any moments/characters come back to surprise you in unexpected ways?"	t5_2qiqi	True
