PDP-1	67	12	28	"The upcoming versions of VS Express 8 will allow [metro-style app development only](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2012/05/18/a-look-ahead-at-the-visual-studio-11-product-lineup-and-platform-support.aspx), with no ability to make traditional desktop or console applications as we can today unless you have a Pro+ version of VS. Furthermore, you'll need to be running Windows8 to make those apps so people on Win7/Vista/XP are out of luck. Finally, if you want to make traditional style apps in Express you'll be limited to 4.0 and VS2010 as there are no plans to update the current Express IDE to 4.5+.

I think this is a bad decision on Microsoft's part for many reasons, and if you agree I'd urge you to let them know what you think [here](http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2645679-visual-studio-11-express-on-windows-7-and-the-abil)!"	t5_2qh3h	True

It basically puts dashboards/UIs on performance data (IO/Cpu/Memory etc) and shows these in realtime where appropriate using tiny lock free  sampling queries (the overhead is miniscule). It also shows you storage data like table size, index fragmentation, buffer useage etc...without having to break out any Sql. The following link does a pretty good job of explaining what it does:

[Screenies/Features](http://www.minidba.com/features.aspx)

[Download](http://www.minidba.com/downloads.aspx)

The beta uploads any exceptions to help me bugfix so just running it would be helpful. If you have the time/inclination to give any feedback then that would be highly appreciated.

Thank for your help /r/dotnet!


*Update* Thanks so much to all of you that have taken the time to run the app and especially those that have submitted feedback - all of which has been constructive. A new version will be released soon including buf fixes and recommendations from /r/dotnet.

.Count() is actually calling a duplicate db call that pulls in only the count of records returned, so when you actually called your query you've pulled twice the load now.

The better thing to do is make sure you pull your data first if you want to get a count of the records your query will return.

I currently work as an enterprise architect for an online gaming (gambling) company. Management decided to move the particular product I work on from the current platform written in Java, to a new platform that is developed using C# in a couple of months. 

While I understand that from the architect's point of view, the software engineering patterns and the enterprise architecture patterns will remain the same, I would like to start reading on .net technologies mainly in relation to frameworks that are used in development of .net applications (like Spring and Hibernate for Java etc), and programming trends etc.

I've never touched MVC, Entity Framework, LINQ, WCF and all the other stuff that everyone is talking about.  I've been stuck in WebForm maintenance hell for many years.  I attended a Code Retreat event on Saturday, which was filled with Ruby developers and polyglots, and it felt like I had no idea what I was doing (I was one of two ""Microsoft Guys"" there).

I don't want to die like this.  I'm thinking of taking a sabbatical and just immersing myself and hopefully come out more confident and well-rounded from the experience.  I have a ton of books that I haven't opened and other training materials (going through SharePoint 2010 development CBT now).  Would expensive instructor-led classes be best?  What about those two week long bootcamps with certifications at the end?  From my experience, just building something using these technologies is the best way, but I lack the knowledge and confidence with most of it.  Some concepts are harder than others for me to grasp.

Mostly doing maintenance work.  Some SharePoint 2007 projects and not much else.  No EF, LINQ, WCF, or MVC experience. Yes, I did this to myself for the last five years.


My job, where I'm the only developer in a small company, is clearly a dead end for me.  I started out as part of a team but everyone is gone because our company shrunk and I'm the only one left.  I'm carrying the load and I'm paid a good market value for the area (Virginia).  However, I'm tired of doing maintenance work that a junior guy could do and I want to ramp up my skills so that I can start contributing to the community and be confident in what I have to offer a new employer or freelance client.  Sometimes I feel like leaving here and just spending a couple of months learning, developing my ideas, and becoming a learner and doer again.


Lesson to all the kids out there: don't get comfortable, learn always, keep on top of new technologies. If your employer doesn't need you to learn anything new, do it on your own time.  I started out with passion and learning new things every day and then lost my drive because of my cushy job and good salary.  This is one field where getting comfortable or stale is the death of you, unless you're happy in a certain position and company.

1343974627.0	xlx52	An average .NET guy's view on ASP MVC 3 vs Rails	imfromtn	22	6	19	"Hi All, fist post on this sub that I've been lurking in for a while.  I'm your average C#.NET coder for an accounting software company by day (I mostly create custom services, console apps, and WinForms apps that leverage our software's web services for our clients), and I've recently been wanting to take a project that I wrote as my college final in 2007 and flesh it out into a full-fledged web application.

Being of the curious sort I thought I might expand my horizons and test the Ruby on Rails waters for this app, so I went through the [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.com/) course which I highly recommend.  After reading quite a bit and learning a lot of new software I was able to successfully port my code over and had a relatively usable application using rails -- here's what I learned:

* First off, this is my first exposure to the MVC lifestyle (yeah, I'm a little behind!), and I must say it's awesome.  The part of building software that has always made the most sense to me is the database, and the way the model/controller layers reflect the database just clicked for me.
* Second, I was forcefully reminded that going from Visual Studio to any other tool is like leaving Scarlett Johansson for... weirder uglier cousin of Scarlett Johansson's already weird ugly cousin. 

So I did what any good dotnetter would do and I tried to build the same app using ASP MVC 3.  I went through the **excellent and free** walk-through chapter of the book Professional ASP.NET 1.0 that you can find [here](http://aspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aspnetmvc-nerdinner_v1.pdf) first, and then started to build my own application.  Using this info, I was again able to create a pretty good application - but this one I built *in about 1/4 of the time*.

But here's the interesting thing -- I think that I can attribute about half of the increased speed of my 2nd build (the ASP MVC one) to really learning what MVC is all about BECAUSE I learned Rails first.  The other half I attribute of course to already knowing .NET.

My experience really boils down to 2 things:
* Rails really taught me ""The Rails Way"" and that was a ridiculously good introduction to what MVC is all about.
* The entire time I was building controllers and model classes with Ruby, *all I could think was that this would be so freakin' cool if I could do it with .NET*.

ASP MVC really gave me exactly what I was looking for in the first place, I just didn't know it UNTIL I went through the growing process of learning Ruby &amp; Rails.  I couldn't be happier that I pushed myself to learn a completely new technology with Rails, but it just really made me appreciate what I got with ASP MVC.

So, **tl;dr;** -- even though they are completely separate technologies (really with some quite different ideals), learning Rails was an excellent introduction to ASP MVC for someone who is learning the MVC ways from scratch.

Hopefully this is useful some useful information for someone, and I would really like to hear about anyone else's experience with Rails and/or ASP MVC and see what the community here thinks."	t5_2qh3h	True

I have basically only programmed in C my entire life, with a bit of C++ experience not in the sense that C++ is a new language, but in the sense that ""Oh cool, you can do classes in C!"". I needed to make a GUI based database application for someone as a project, so naturally i decided to learn GTK, since I only need to know C...

But a month later i realized i only had my git repo set up and a few text boxes...

I tried to look for tutorials and stuff on C#, but there is so much overwhelming stuff online with thousands of acronyms that mean nothing to me. Can anyone point me in the right direction so I can do a simple database application that is NOT scalable and requires very little SQL knowledge as quickly as possible (my friend's needs are not that great, it's a simple shop inventory type of thing)?

I know I need to use LINQ or something, but Microsoft's website isn't helping a lot and their documentation is weird at best, and confusing most of the time...

Reading books at home and trying to learn at the weekends is exhausting and I have my own family/home life. I have nobody around to learn from, which makes it hard work when I could do with someone to ask questions and provide guidance myself.

I have projects to work on to deadlines, other dev's need assistance, and I'm trying to learn stuff like MVC so we can adopt it for our web projects, and learn and understand design patterns etc. How can I fit it all in?

Are any of you guys in a similar situation? How do you cope? What do you do?

After testing, he delayed the entire project by several months to let some other programmer redo the taskbar app in visual basic, so that it would compile to a 8086 exe instead of a dotnet exe. The reason was that he didn't want people to have to install 'some weird 3rd party software'.

I didn't consider the .net framework weird, I had even compiled it for an older version (1.1) because I didn't use any of the newer stuff anyway. I considered it an integral part of windows.

So, the big question for me is: do people actually have .net installed? And I don't mean us programmers, but just the general public running XP home edition on a 6-year old laptop to browse to hotmail in IE7 with 70 search bars and 3 out of date virus killer trial editions installed.

In a few words, this book is BORING. AS. SHIT.

Now with an attitude like that, you can safely assume that I'm struggling to stay motivated. This experience is making me question whether I want to head down the programming path at all.

The problem is that I currently know at least 50% of the material but as a kinesthetic learner, there's not much in the way of activities that don't feel like you're just copying text out of a book...(because that's exactly what you end up doing)

The whole book is written in such a way that by the time I'm in the groove and I've picked up on what I'm working with, the text starts to lose all meaning and I end up just looking at words.
(I liken it to reading the profound ramblings of Nietzsche - I'm sure it makes sense on some plane but there *has* to be an easier way to extract this information.)

Yes, there are bound to be other factors here (such as Jack's lack of self-discipline) but I'm trying not to make it all about me here... Some sharing of the love is required for anyone who finds themselves in my position.

...With a good fundamental understanding of OOP:

- Are there any activities that use .Net to get some practice (even ideas that folks have come up with on their own)

- What sort of real-world examples are out there? (I presume most .net stuff ends up being closed-source so is anyone aware of any open source projects for cool programs?)

- What other web resources might I (or anyone else in the same boat) like to check out to get some inspiration?

- What has helped people get over these 'study blocks'?

Just reading through the subreddit, I am not recognizing the majority of terms (hence using a throw away account out of shame).

So at the very least, looks like I need to catch up on

* Entity Framework
* jquery
* .NET 4.5
* LinQ

So some guidance to get me jump started on training would be much appreciated.

Here's my basic problem. Say I have a weblog piece of software that I'm writing. For a post page I want to display 

[Post]
[CommentList]
[InsertNewComment]

Seems simple enough. At first I was able just to use my normal PostModel and it's IEnumerable&lt;Comment&gt; to display everything in the View. But then when it came time to add a comment I started screwing stuff up. Nothing ever quite felt ""right"".

I'm thinking I might need a NewCommentController that the form posts to and then have it redirect back to the DisplayPost action and that seems to make sense, but then I started hacking away at how to do validation because the form wasn't part of the model.

Anyways, I was just curious how others feel the clean way of doing this would be. I tried pulling the NewComment section out into a PartialAction, but then I was unable to do the redirect so I fear I misinterpreted the purpose of the PartialAction"	t5_2qh3h	True

I have a frames-based data driven ASP site that I want to start planning to convert. In terms of site planning, can I get most of the information that I need from one of the 'professional ASP.NET' books, or do I need to look at a more specific title? For example, in upgrading a frame-based site, are master pages the obvious solution, or is there a better/easier way to maintain the current look and feel? MVC or Web Forms? Etc. Advice greatly appreciated.

Edit: Forgot to add that the site is also branded, i.e. the majority of the site code is shared among about a dozen customers, who all have their own look and feel. The complicating factor is that some of them have a different layout, such as a top menu vs. a left menu, bigger header, no footer, etc."	t5_2qh3h	True

1343915354.0	xk9cb	Company wants me to switch to Java. What would you do?	samofny	13	3	39	"I've been developing ASP.NET apps since 1.0 and have been working with a defense contractor.  However, all future work that's coming in is Java based.  Basically, they want to send me to Java training so that I can stay and work on the new projects.  We will be hiring an experienced Java developer too.  I've been looking at expanding my skill set and learning new things, and this is a good opportunity to do so (and be forced to actually do it rather than procrastinate when trying to do it myself without incentive).



I'm trying to put a positive spin on this.  There are some ASP.NET jobs around here, but it's more of the same.  My skills have been rusting away because the apps I work on are old and it's mostly maintenance work.  This would improve my resume and get me learning something new.

* Create an add-in (not a problem, there's a template for this...)
* Create a control (probably WPF...) that can display the contents. (not a problem again, I can build it elsewhere while trying to figure the rest out.)

Apologies for this may be a recurring question but I would genuinely appreciate any help.

I am a web developer working on ASP.Net applications for the last 4 years. Due to the nature of my project, I am still working on .Net 2.0 while the world has moved forward to .Net 4.0. Recently, I have just received news from my employer that a new project will soon way which will eventually be based on .Net 3.5 or .Net 4.0 framework.

They have offered to pay for a certification (just because they want to buy partnership for which 2 certifications are a must if i'm not wrong)

I went through the certifications website to read about MCPD, MCTS and MCAD. There are no professionals online for a live chat. 

Based on my current expertise, Can anyone suggest the path I should take to move forward. I definitely intend to continue further certifications on my own in the future but at this present moment,I am confused with what certification or exams I should pursue.

Any help is genuinely appreciated.
 

EDIT 1: My personal hunch is to start with MCTS ( 70-536 &amp; 70–528: TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Web-Based Client Development) and then move along further.

At the same time, I have a separate database that gets the file in a different format (in the middle of changing from old DB to SQL Server). I was originally planning on just doing what I usually do, let a VBA app run through the file and make the changes I need, but our System admin suggested something else.

I was informed I should have a place to upload a file and then write something in C# to parse through the data. I found the ""filehelpers"" library and it looks promising, but let me explain what we need done to the file.

The data coming in is from different hospitals, I have a different VBA script for each hospital. Each script does things a little different, but for the most part it goes through and formats the data. For instance in name fields it will make sure there's no whitespace before the comma and only one space after it. Also small things like shortening zip code fields to 5 digits and phone numbers to 10 and taking out characters in certain fields.

Now here's where I'm a little stuck. I need to ""compress"" the records. Most hospitals instead of having a quantity for prescribed medicines will just create a new record for each medication prescribed. What I do is go through and check for alike records. If they have the same patient, date range, drug, etc. I add a quantity field and add the numbers up. 

So, if there are 5 records for Joe smith, receiving advil 10mg from dr. patel I end up shortening it to one record for Joe Smith receiving quantity of 5 advil 10mg from dr patel.

Like I mentioned, I already have all this coded into VBA apps. I'm having a hard time understanding why to do it the way our system admin suggested. Regardless when I get a dataset from a hospital I have to physically open it and save it as a .csv or do something else to it because they all come in different. So why not just continue using my VBA apps to do this? He says it will lower my workload since I need to design a way to get data into this new sql database but I just don't think rewriting all my code in C# from VBA is going to save me a bunch of time, especially when I have to physically open and touch the file anyways.

Anybody have any suggestions? I'll check back when I get home from work and will answer any questions people have/provide more details."	t5_2qh3h	True

* Did swipe right with x fingers, y hands
* Did pan on screen with x fingers, y hands
* Did tap with x fingers, y hands
* Did rotate with x fingers, y hands
* Did pinch with x fingers, y hands

This is built on top of the Leap SDK, and a level of abstraction up. We hope that this can be the foundation for a community driven, gesture recognition abstraction layer for the Leap Motion.

The association's business model has changed significantly and the app is showing it's age.  We attempted to find a VB6 dev but the two we attempted to use didn't work out.  We also feel that the app maybe should be rebuilt with current .NET technologies.  

I'm fairly new to .NET development.  I'm mainly a PHP/front-end guy.  But we're an association with limited resources so I'm trying to fit on a .NET hat.

At first I thought we'd build a new app in WPF so we can have the desktop experience.  But now I'm leaning more towards building a web app which I think would allow the staff to access the app anywhere they can get on the web so they won't need to remote desktop/VPN in to the office.

Why would someone build a WPF app when most of the same functionality can be created in a web app?

I nor anyone else in the office has used MVC, and I'm curious to try it.  I'll be learning at home and showing my projects to the guys in the office to see if it is a direction we would like to pursue.  From what I've gathered from MVC the Models would be our classes in our BusinessObjects project and then our BusinessLogic and DataAccess layers facilitate the methods to handle the interfacing of those objects with the data source (typically SQL Server).

But I guess what my real question is: Does MVC allow for a Tiered layout like we do with the Web Form and even if it does what would be the preferred way of handling data connections?  I plan on putting together a home project to learn MVC myself and to use to show my coworkers, so any tips/pointers are also welcomed.

Personally, I see no reason we couldn't use a 3 tiered architecture with MVC, but I am a complete newb to MVC design and even if we could do 3 tiered I wonder if it would be the ideal way to handle it."	t5_2qh3h	True

Ideally I'll have a UI that looks something like this: http://www.behance.net/gallery/Domino-for-iPadiPhoneMac/4266645. 

I've done a bit of research, but am unable to determine how best to create the game board. I suppose the two options are:
1) Using a blank canvas object and drawing it myself
2) Using Data Binding on a Grid.

Data binding seems to probably be the way to go, but given that I don't have a simple grid scenario (the grid gets very complicated if you factor in horizontals, verticals [for doubles], bending around corners, etc.), I'm not sure that it fits the problem neatly. I worry that data binding is more trouble than it's worth for non-trivial grids like what I'm attempting to create.

I'd like to get thoughts on how others would go about solving this problem, as I'm feeling quite stuck on where to start. I've been attempting to use http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Reversi-XAMLC-sample-board-816140fa as a base, but I think our differences are greater than our similarities, given that it uses a simple grid pattern that I don't have the luxury of.

I have this exact issue when I use this technique to inject an .NET C# REPL environment into another .net process: [Video: Injecting C# DLLs into Managed (C#) and Unmanaged (C++) processes](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/video-injecting-c-dlls-into-managed-c.html)

I've been programming for years, lately mostly PHP stuff but have used PERL, C, C++, ASP in the past as well as shell scripting and suchlike.

I've dabbled in VBA stuff (ick) but haven't used the MS IDEs at all and am unfamiliar with their tools.

I come from a non-IDE paradigm, writing code from scratch, using libraries of course, and I'm not one to reinvent the wheel at all, but I'm a bit wary of coding the Microsoft Way, it seems foreign to me. A text editor and shell are what I am most familiar with. 

I'm preparing myself for a move to a position at a .NET using company. They have a large workforce and lots of data to chew through. I would like to apply my expertise in web applications and data processing to help them automate things and get useful data for business intelligence.

I'm familiar with Oracle, MySQL and PostreSQL, but not SQL Server.
I'm familiar with Apache and NGINX but not IIS.
I'm familiar with iPhones and Android dev but not WinPhones.
I'm familiar with memcached, redis, couchdb and MongoDB but not whatever fills these roles in the Windows world.
I'm familiar with NFS, XFS, ZFS, crontab, BASH, Daemontools, Git, Hg and SubVersion but not whatever fills these roles in the Windows world.

The way Microsoft packages this stuff is really foreign to me, with so many legacy things in place, and their insistence on creating what look like barriers between channels I don't know what I should focus on, what tools to get and what books to purchase. I can't afford what looks like around $5k to use the full suite of tools, and coming from the outside I really can't tell what would be useful.

Any help or advice you could offer would be hugely appreciated. "	t5_2qh3h	True

I'm sure i'll be able to do the job but at my current work I do a bit of everything (dotNet, Html, CSS, Flash, Cocoa), I generally get moved to where the latest fire is. While this is good and kept things interesting it also means that for my last 3 years I haven't being doing dotNet solidly.

Add to that that at my company the senior dotNet developer writes up how to do something kinda like a template. It would get given to me and I then use that as a base to implement it everywhere (example: 'This is how you provision a .com product, now implement .com.au, .net ,etc'). This means the intricacies of c# and dotNet aren't always obvious to me because they have already been though of in the example given to me. 

So while I think i'm good at programming and I do believe I'll probably be lacking in the in-depth knowledge required for these tests? Would you agree?

Or am I just overreacting and the tests aren't going to be about the finer details?

1282757977.0	d5cz6	I'd like to refactor a few things, and I need some help with marshaling...	doomchild	8	3	7	"Okay, so back in the days of yore, we (by which I mean ""my boss"") developed some external boards for use in the big printers we make.  I wrote the PC side of the code, and I wanted to do as much in the managed world as possible (because I hate C++).  So I wrote a great little transport layer that works for any board using the same family of microprocessor.

That layer was and is (obviously) very generic, and handles the stuff that can be hard to do right, like dealing with sending and receiving messages in a thread-safe manner, etc.  The board-specific code just has to define a few messages that inherit from a base class, and everything is happy.

The only problem is that any message that holds an array has to specify a fixed size at compile time, because UnmanagedType.ByValArray requires SizeConst to be set, viz:

    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
    public class SomeMessage : MessageBase
    {
        public short AdcReading;
        public byte SomethingOrWhatever;
    
        [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.ByValArray, SizeConst = 10)]
        public readonly byte[] OpCodeArray;
    
        public SomeMessage()
        {
            OpCodeArray = new byte[10];
        }
    }

This wasn't really a problem, because our board firmware, once it's built, doesn't really change, since the boards are built to do one and only one thing.  However, an asinine experiment has required that we open up things on a board that were formerly inaccessible to the outside world.  The practical effect of all this on me is that I have to make that array bigger.  It's the kind of thing we're getting paid for, but is a stupid idea, so we're going to do it, but we're going to bitch about it as well.

Now, obviously, I could easily write a wholly separate little class to deal with this foolishness.  And that's what I've done for the short term.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of classes on top of this one now, and I *really* don't want to duplicate that whole chain if this experiment winds up necessitating a permanent version of all this.

What I'd *much* rather do is be able to change the maximum size of that array in the code, so that I can call a static function or something.  That will mean I don't have to have two almost identical sets of classes, which is a prospect that sets my teeth on edge.

1355514275.0	14uvxc	Can I synchronize two or more processes by using a file?	justgetmeonhere	9	5	43	"More or less what it says. Instead of using .NET's or the operating system's built-in process synchronization methods (locks, semaphores, etc) can I achieve the same thing by reading from/writing to a file of some kind? I really don't want to do it that way, I'm only asking because I'm trying to be thorough.

The software that I work on, which is a legacy VB6 desktop application, has expanded into a VB6/VB.NET multiple-user application. Needless to say, collisions of various kinds are starting to crop up and I want to start laying down some some concurrency controls. But my boss, paranoid of change as he is, doesn't really ""trust"" that the operating system or the language features will always behave as expected. He's already doing some concurrency in parts of the old VB6 code, which consists of writing a value to an INI file. A process that needs to do some synchronized task first has to check if this value exists. If it doesn't, then it writes that value, does its thing and then removes the value. Otherwise it (usually) aborts the operation. This doesn't really offer the security of a lock, however, as two processes could still potentially access the INI file at the same instant. Nevermind that if process holding the lock crashes for whatever reason before it can release the lock, the value won't change unless you go into the file and manually edit it.

So basically, I want to know if it's possible that my boss isn't wrong and I just need to tweak his code some, or if it's an unwinnable battle and that I'm right to want to use other means.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone! You all told me what I already know, all that was missing was the confidence. I need to tell my boss to either prove me wrong or suck it up."	t5_2qh3h	True

Probablynotclever	7	1	5	"I was hired into a position a few months ago in which I was asked to transition from PHP to C# ASP.net. So far, I've done fine learning what's necessary simply by building projects that are assigned to me. Most of these tasks are simple CRUD operations using Web Forms. 

I'd like to go one step further, though. I would like to be able to fully immerse myself in the framework and language so that I have knowledge beyond what's asked of me so that I can be more proactive in finding solutions to my own problems. Furthermore, my workplace is behind the times pretty drastically, having just begun playing with the notion of using MVC. 

What resources would you recommend to immerse myself in the environment in a more comprehensive way? I see all of these neat learning tools for open source languages, such as codeschool and codeacademy, but I haven't seen comparable resources available for ASP.net and C#.

In the above link you'll find two files: StudentFormViewModel.cs (172 LOC) and StudentFormViewModelTests.cs (210 LOC).

I've built an app pretty much replicating [Josh Smith's article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx) demonstrating the MVVM pattern. However, he doesn't discuss unit testing in depth and I'm unsure if I'm testing the ViewModel correctly.

There are 14 tests and they test things like:

* If my ViewModel inherits from the correct base class.  
* If the ViewModel implements the expected interface.  
* If the constructor sets certain properties.  
* If the properties raise the property changed event of INotifyPropertyChanged when the setter is called.  
* If the ICommand properties are in fact ICommand properties and that they do the what is expected of them when Execute is called on them. Also checks the CanExecute works as expected.  
* Finally, a bunch of check to see if my validation logic is working as expected.

I've used the region directive all over the place for organization so I'd suggest copying the code to an editor that recognizes the directive so you could collapse region while reviewing the code. 

I think the ViewModel code has been implemented pretty well but I sort of just winged it with the unit tests and I'm not really confident whether I covered all required territory well enough. Perhaps if I used a tests-first approach I'd feel more confident about them."	t5_2qh3h	True

MVC projects require a set of model classes for the views, you can then have models which represent entities for data that is retreived from the database with an ORM such as EntityFramework. There is also the scenario where you might want to model domain/business specific data that doesnt belong in the view or the database. There is also the case for a set of models for the transfer of data i.e. Data transfer objects.

I've seen a combination of all of these in various projects. I'm wondering what others consider as a good approach to deal with this situation. Sometimes I scratch my head trying to find the best compromise between separation of concerns but also avoiding too much duplication of data and avoiding having to write boiler plate to convert one model type to another.

I have a WPF application with a Windows Form element hosted inside it, using this method:

    System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost host = new System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost();

    gMapZoom = new GMap();
    gMapZoom.Paint += new PaintEventHandler(gMapZoom_Paint);

    // control's collection of child controls.
    this.grid1.Children.Add(host);

However, I'm having problems trying to add a custom Paint event handler to it.  It seems that adding it in WPF causes the drawing to be done *beneath* the WinForm control, so nothing appears on top. Adding it to the WinForm control (as seen here) does nothing whatsoever; the paint event, gMapZoom_Paint, is never even called.

I have a page that passes a message to a DLL, and then waits up to three seconds for a response.  However nothing I've tried will cause it to actually get the response.  I've written the same code in a Windows form to verify that everything SHOULD work.

Here's a snippet of the problem code:

    Private Sub SendMessage()
        ResponseData = """"
        Dim Msg As New UMP.v9.Messaging.Message
        M.SendMessageClassic(Msg)
        '---M is the reference to the DLL
        For I As Integer = 1 To 6
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500)
            If ResponseData &lt;&gt; """" Then Exit For
        Next
        If ResponseData = """" Then ResponseData = ""Nothing Received""
        txtResponse.InnerHtml = ResponseData &amp; "" - "" &amp; Now().ToString
    End Sub

    Private Sub GotSomething(ByVal Msg As UMP.v9.Messaging.Message) Handles M.ClassicMessageReceived
        If Msg.Data.Contains(""WACK"") Or Msg.Data.Contains(""WNCK"") Then
            ResponseData = Msg.Port &amp; "": "" &amp; Msg.Data
        End If
    End Sub

The issue is in the for/next loop within SendMessage.  The code that's there is only the latest iteration of a very long line of things I've tried.  It will wait for the full three seconds, but never notice that the event has fired.  As far as it's concerned, ResponseData ALWAYS = """", even if I've updated it within the event handler in the meantime.

Oddly enough, if I put MsgBox(""foo"") on a line between the sleep and the check for ResponseData, it works fine... but obviously I can't have a MsgBox on a web app.

This will ultimately become a webservice, so things like AJAX will not apply in this scenario.

edit: other comments or suggestions are also welcome.

edit2: the solution:

        Boolean show_hidden = (HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[""show_hidden""] == ""1"");

        if (show_hidden)
        {
              ... do other stuff here.
        }

        var query = 
            from u in db.Users
            where u.user_id == (Guid)Session[""user_id""]
            from c in db.sc_Carriers
            where c.shipper_id == u.Company.company_id &amp;&amp; c.hidden == show_hidden
            select new { 
                company = c.CarrierDetail.Company.company,
                full_name = c.sc_Manager.comp_fname + ' ' + c.sc_Manager.comp_lname,
                sort_name = c.sc_Manager.comp_lname + ' ' + c.sc_Manager.comp_fname,
                comp_email = c.sc_Manager.comp_email,
                dot_num = c.CarrierDetail.dot_num,
                c.carrier_id
            };

        e.Result = query;

ps: I know I can set the 'Where' clause after the fact (query.Where(""this = @0"", params)), but I can't seem to figure out how to do that when I've lost the context -- I need the u.Company.company_id value.  Suggestions welcome."	t5_2qh3h	True

Right now I've got some basic code that's not a server control, and I want to learn more about server controls after writing a simple one.

I've got a div that's invisible, which is centered on the screen.
In the code behind, to make the fading message appear on page_load I use :

    public sub page_load()...
        ClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock(getType(form), _
         "" ['Please enter stuff!] jQuery code to animate a fade, and then hide div]"", false)
    end sub

And if the message popup is to appear in an updatePanel (which does NOT refresh all the page contents, but only whats in the panel)... I do this....

    public sub button_click() handles button.click...
        [do stuff]
        ClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptBlock(getType(form), _
         "" ['Button pressed!], jQuery code to animate a fade, and then hide div]"", false)
    end sub

It works GREAT!

But I have some questions about the server control I want to write!

Lets say a user drops the (SINGLE only) popup component onto their page-design view:

    &lt;SarahC:MessagePopup color=""#f0f0f0"" defaultText=""""
          fadeSpeed=""1000"" /&gt;

This will write the message DIV to the page on page load, and write a JavaScript function that contains the JavaScript I mentioned earlier....

    &lt;div ID=""messagePopup"" class=""hiddenCenterPopup""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    function messagePopup(message) {
        [jQuery code to animate a fade, and then hide div]
     }
    &lt;/script&gt;

Ok so far!

**But what if the user clicks a button in an UpdatePanel tag!?**
How do I handle that so some JavaScript is sent, when the popup code is OUTSIDE of the update panel?


    &lt;!-- Update panel is at the top of the page --&gt;
    &lt;SarahC:MessagePopup color=""#f0f0f0"" defaultText=""""
          fadeSpeed=""1000"" /&gt;   

    &lt;!-- The button causes all this to be re-rendered on click, I want to send
          JavaScript into it to activate the display message function in JavaScript --&gt;
    &lt;asp:updatePanel ID=""panel1"" runat=""server"" &gt;
        &lt;asp:contentTemplate runat=""server"" &gt;
            &lt;button runat=""server"" ID=""clickedMe"" /&gt;
        &lt;/asp:contentTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/asp:updatePanel&gt;


    public sub buttonClick() handles clickedMe.click
        [stuff here]
        messagePopup.newMessage(""Yo! This is a popup!"")
    end sub

Sorry for the syntax mistakes, I'm writing this directly for the question!

See in the example code above, my server control is OUTSIDE the updatePanel?    
The bit of ASP code that triggers the ""show popup"" is from inside the updatePanel - so as my server control isn't given a chance to re-render, how can I get some JavaScript sent in the HTML that's sent back inside the update panel to display my DIV tag?

I'm hoping something like this in my server control!:

    public message as String
    public triggerRendering as boolean=false


**I bet ""renderFromUpdatePanel"" DOESNT exist as a default call! What can I do INSTEAD, to get HTML sent when an updatePanel is rendered?**          

    public sub renderFromUpdatePanel() 
         if not triggerRendering then return
         write.stream(""&lt;script&gt;showPopup("" &amp; message &amp; "");&lt;/script&gt;"")
    end sub

    public sub render()
         if not triggerRendering then return
         write.stream(""&lt;script&gt;showPopup("" &amp; message &amp; "");&lt;/script&gt;"")
    end sub


    public sub newMessage(byref message as String)
        me.message=message
        triggerRendering=true
    end sub
