1360344625.0	18536m	Turning off private messages.	williamshatner	2392	609	3056	"Hellllooooo Admins!

I'm a relatively new user of Reddit but I have discovered a bit of an annoying aspect that I'd like to request a future enhancement. I love the unread tab in the message area for new updates to the posts I've made,  It helps me to navigate to new content that I can read and respond to.   My issue: a lot of what now fills my unread page are private messages asking for autographs, can I call someone, could I donate, etc...  

I would like the ability to turn off inbox private messages on my account.  Mabye with an option to allow messages from moderators.  

OR - maybe separate out the tabs so unread replies to posts are on one page and unread private messages appear on a separate tab that I can choose to ignore.

I thank you for your time.

My best, Bill"	t5_2qqhi	True

If we can't do the entire site, then perhaps you guys could help with a few subreddits or something? Or even if you just gave the link some publicity so that people can decide for themselves?

1352402422.0	12vdbw	As an artist who has had my work front-paged on Reddit with no credit given I ask, why not add a 'creddit' section when submitting? (r-post from /r/AskReddit)	crapidrawatwork	985	142	58	"I first found out about reddit when someone posted a [gaming sculpture](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=207413079311157&amp;set=a.149441981774934.39027.149439821775150&amp;type=3&amp;theater) I made and it front-paged. It was so exciting to get some attention for my piece, but so disappointing that no one knew where it came from, it was just another random picture on reddit.

Since then, I have tried to post my artwork first with a good amount of success, but have learned that linking to my facebook fan site always gets voted down, reddit just prefers image hosting sites like imgur. I've tried to credit as a comment, but since sourcing isn't very witty it tends to just get buried.

Of course, there are also the haters that attack me for posting my own stuff, calling it 'self-promotion', when I am really just trying to post from the source.

1332626903.0	rbwn4	Rank threads and the frontpage by discussion rather than by voting.	MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE	905	300	25	"Currently, all of the ranking options for both links on the frontpage and for comment threads are based on some calculation of **upvotes**, **downvotes**, and **time**.

The frontpage can be ranked by: Hot, New, Controversial, and Top

Comment threads can be ranked by: Top, Hot, New, Controversial, Old, and Best

All of these ranking systems incorporate those same three elements – upvotes, downvotes, and time – but give them different importance or weighting.

A fourth element should be added: **discussion**.

One of the main complaints featured across reddit is the decline in content: links that do not attract good discussion and trivial comment threads dominating discussion.

Most of the observers over at /r/TheoryOfReddit have noted that voting tends to favor low-investment content: it's easier to upvote something simple, like an image macro or a pun thread, than it is to read and upvote a thoughtful piece of in-depth journalism or a long detailed comment.

**Step 1:**

Adding a new way to rank comment threads would be a good first step toward allowing users who prefer thoughtful and detailed comments to be able to avoid pun threads full of dispiriting one-liners and stale meme jokes.  My proposal is not to get rid of upvotes, downvotes, and time in the calculation of comment ranking, but to add a heavily-weighted fourth criterion which is: the **length of the comment and its children**.  This would prioritize comments that are both detailed themselves and those that generate subsequent detailed conversation/responses.  The aggregate length of an entire thread of one-liners might be outweighed by a different thread consisting of one or two long comments.

**Step 2:**

Add a new way to rank the frontpage, based primarily on discussion+time rather than on upvotes/downvotes+time.

A major [quantitative study of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/l8id4/did_digg_make_us_the_dumb_how_have_reddit/) noted that comment length on the frontpage declined – [older comments were 2–3x longer than those that appear on the frontpage currently](http://i.imgur.com/C8Dr2.png).  The author then demonstrated that the subreddits with the most trivial, low-investment content (nsfw, gonewild, pics, funny, videos, trees, wtf) also feature comments with the shortest length compared to subreddits with in-depth or intellectually-stimulating content (philosophy, truereddit, economics) – [here's the chart](http://i.imgur.com/HOTQP.png).

Ranking the frontpage based on the activity and quality of the conversation generated could produce a wildly different experience for users interested in engaging material and discussion rather than [low-investment fluff](http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html).  Using some weighted combination of the following criteria could produce a frontpage ranked by quality discussion rather than by upvotes+downvotes+time:

* Average (or median) comment length;
* Total amount of comment text; and,
* Commenting activity (comments per unit of time).

Hacker News already has an [alternate frontpage ranking algorithm that shows stories by the activity of discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/active).  I believe their source code is open, so that may be a good example or first pass of a system that could be adapted to work here.

**Potential Issues**

*First, what role do upvotes and downvotes play in a system like this?*  I think will still have a role, especially in downvoting abusive or spam comments below the threshold for visibility.  My proposal is not to entirely remove upvotes/downvotes from ranking comment threads, but to change the weighting to favor comment length and discussion more heavily than the other traditional factors.  As far as upvotes/downvotes on the frontpage, I suppose they would still matter insofar as you want other people (especially those not ranking the frontpage by discussion) to see content that you value.  Finally, upvotes will still accrue to a user's karma as a reward for their contributions (or downvotes as punishment).

*Second, will the frontpage be utterly dominated by AskReddit?*  Maybe, but probably not.  AskReddit seems to be only [slightly above average in terms of comment length](http://i.imgur.com/HOTQP.png), even though popular AskReddit threads generate disproportionately large numbers of comments.  Reddit has already developed ways to make sure that users' frontpages have a healthy mix of stories from gigantic subreddits and obscure subreddits, making frontpage placement relative to subreddit size.  The same mechanism should, in principle, work with a ranking system centered on discussion rather than voting.

*Third, can this system be gamed?*  Yes, but perhaps not as easily as upvoting circlejerks.  Spammers could start dumping walls of nonsense text into threads.  Hopefully this can be countered with good old downvoting and moderation.  This type of behavior is probably more transparently spamming than pay-for-upvote networks of dummy accounts, and may actually make countering spammers easier.  It's harder to drive a thread or link up to the top of the rankings by [making detailed on-topic comments](http://xkcd.com/810/) than by clicking the upvote arrow.  Finally, unless ranking-by-discussion is made the default method of ranking the frontpage, it's unlikely that spammers and SEO agents will specifically target it for exploitation.

**Conclusion**

We need a way to preserve constructive interaction in the face of Eternal September's onslaught of trivial low-investment content.  People need to be able to see that the effort it takes to write out a constructive contribution to the community is going to be seen and rewarded rather than lost in a sea of one-liner stale jokes.

Because writing long comments and engaging in discussion is a better indicator of engaging material than an upvote is, and is a better measurement indicator for discriminating between low-investment and high-investment content, giving redditors the option to rank content by quality discussion can help preserve a core community of users committed to making informative and interesting contributions."	t5_2qqhi	True

That's around 35,000 users in these 7 subs alone who use the tagging system. These are just 6 of the subs I know of that use tags, I am sure there are many more.


Look at the extra items beside some of the usernames. 

**philkav** becomes **philkav(philkav1989)[360]**

These are redditor's gamertags and platforms for when they playing online. 

This is done by adding the following CSS : 

    .author[href$=""/philkav""]:after {content: ""(philkav1989)[360]"" !important}

The 2 subs I moderate have over 2,500 members each (a lot of the same people, but it's still a large range of users). The problem is, not everyone can get one of these tags as the stylesheets only allow something like 100kb of data* . It would be great if the capacity of the custom stylesheets was increased because both my subs ( [r/mw2](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw2) and [r/codbo](http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo) ) are completely full and [r/codbo](http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo) has a backlog of about 500 users waiting to get their gamertag and platform appended onto their name .

1327182549.0	oqnxk	On behalf of the entire book and TV-show subreddit communities I humbly request a real spoiler tag.	RainbowCrash	349	88	131	"I am not referring to the black text spoiler tags in comments, I speak of spoiler tags on posts.

I'm a mod of [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony), and we currently use the NSFW tag as a spoiler tag, because we don't allow NSFW posts.

What's nice about this is we can, as mods, set any post as a spoiler without the user tagging it. It also lets the users not have to include the word ""spoiler"" in their posts. It hides the thumbnail, and lets the browsers know what they're getting into.

Although the nsfw tag serves our purposes, we get a lot of [modmails like this](http://i.imgur.com/5ZLFd.png), as our posts appear to be ""NSFW"" on [/r/all](/r/all) when really they aren't.

Please, I implore you guys, consider adding a real Spoiler tag for posts.

It would have the EXACT same functionality as the NSFW tag, except that you would be able to enable/disable it in the community setting section, and it would be titled ""Spoiler"" with it's own thumbnail. That way mods/posters can set something to be a spoiler after the fact. Another helpful (possible) feature would be to have a checkmark in the sidebar that hides all spoiler posts when checked, so people can browse the sub without worry.

This is not just our subreddit either, many other TV show, book, and even game subreddits have this same problem, and they all have their own workarounds for it. ([/r/skyrim](/r/skyrim), [/r/gameofthrones](/r/gameofthrones), [/r/breakingbad](/r/breakingbad) (uses our same system of nsfw), [/r/doctorwho](/r/doctorwho) to name a few) They all, however, pale in comparison to a real, actual, supported spoiler tag.

I suggest that we allow mods to categorise users to make this easier. As a *moderator*, I would like to be able to do the following:

* Create and maintain a list of tags/categories

Jameshfisher	159	29	53	"References to a subreddit often have a button next to them that allows you to toggle whether it hits your frontpage.  However IMO their wording and appearance makes their function completely ambiguous.


The problem
--------------

Take this button: [-frontpage](http://i51.tinypic.com/jghc75.jpg).  There are two equally plausible interpretations:

* ""This subreddit is not currently on your frontpage.  (Click here to toggle.)""
* ""Click here to remove this subreddit from your frontpage.  (*i.e.,* it is currently on your frontpage.)""

It turns out that it happens to mean the latter.  This was not my first interpretation.  The exact same ambiguity applies to this button, conversely: [+frontpage](http://i53.tinypic.com/b80dfk_th.png).  

The color of the button does not help as a visual cue at all.  I interpret green to mean ""all systems go""; *i.e.,* this subreddit is *running.*  This is the exact opposite of what it happens to mean on reddit.  I interpret red to mean ""uh oh -- there's a problem here, you'd better check it out.""  Again, this is not what in means on reddit.

A solution
-----------

The ambiguity in the text has to be removed.  It must be clear whether ""+frontpage"" is a *statement of fact* or a *possible action*.  The word ""frontpage"" is the problem here; a more effective word is ""subscribe"".  So either:

* ""subscribed"" and ""not subscribed"" (statements of fact), which seems to be people's preference, or
* ""subscribe"" and ""unsubscribe"" (actions).

This should be implemented as an HTML form checkbox.  Everyone knows how this widget works.  Use background Javascript to update preferences, as is currently done.

If this is to be styled, the red/green scheme must go.  This traditionally signals whether or not there's a problem (not appropriate here).  The dichotomy that is actually wanted here is just between On and Off.  This would be appropriately signaled by, say, green and *grey*, where grey means ""this things not being used, but it's here when you want it"".

Five digits of ""karma,"" damn near six digits of ""comment karma.""  Clearly, I am a better person than you.  Clearly, I am more important.  Clearly, my opinions carry a greater weight, I look better in a suit, my shit stinks less than yours and I am further on the five-fold path to enlightenment than you.

You all believe that, right?

Sure, you do.  In fact, you believe that because I've got damn near six digit comment karma I'm obviously a lifeless tardbag who hangs out on the internet all day with other neckbeards (not far from the truth, but far enough for me to be indignant about it).  In fact, once you hit a certain level, people will start downvoting you on principle.  Once you are no longer one of the anonymous horde of usernames, people will single you out.  Stalk you.  [come up with crazy ideas about your direct involvement in the downfall of humanity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cl81x/a_violation_of_trust_and_community_values/)  Over a fucking number.

Now, that's not to say karma doesn't matter.  If your karma is negative, you're put on ""time out"" and you can't post comments or posts until you've built up enough of it.  If you try to post or comment in a subreddit and your karma is low **in that particular subreddit** (believe it or not, you can have damn-near six-digit comment karma and you will still get held back from posting in subreddits new to you) you're put on time out.  But other than that, we're actually running the hippie model of karma - wherein karma is something to be avoided because there is no good, only bad.

""Karma"" probably made sense in the beginning.  I'm sure that as a number it's still useful.  Karma for individual posts?  That's the score of the game and that's good and great and hells yeah - that shit oughtta be tracked 'cuz it's fun.  But not even *reddit* remembers yesterday's posts.  Why should we remember their scores?  I draw a great satisfaction from seeing the love [heaped upon good deeds](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ahg8x/what_is_the_nicest_thing_youve_ever_done_that_no/c0hkuyq) but [we're all human.](http://www.reddit.com/user/WarToad)  

And especially now that we've got ""trophy cases.""  Don't get me wrong - I think it's **much** more important to celebrate what we bring to this community for the contributions than for some sort of overall ""score.""  I think the trophy case is exactly the right direction to be headed, despite the fact that every single time I'm told how ""well rounded"" I am I feel like the kid in little league who got a ""participant"" trophy.

We're now handing out badges based on the age of the account.  That's useful, kinda.  More useful than some arbitrary number to the right of our names.  Many people have talked about other badges, too - those are also cool.  The fact that they *link* to particular accomplishments (most controversial comment, reddit traveler, secret santa, etc) is a cool thing, and no ""score"" can ever really replace that.  

The only way I can see the utility of keeping our ""karma scores"" at all visible is when it interferes with our participation in Reddit.  If I've been banned from posting in a subreddit, turn my name red (ONLY FOR ME, not for everyone).  If I don't have enough karma in a particular subreddit to post without restriction, give me (AND ONLY ME) a countdown to zero - after all, that's karma I have to ""work off"" before I can do anything.  If I'm in a private subreddit, turn my name italic or something.

In other words, show me the shit that matters and hide the shit that doesn't.

Reddit has a bizarre relationship with ""karma.""  On the one hand, we love it.  On the other hand, we use it as evidence in witchburnings.  Some people are too hip for ""karma.""

So I have been on a subreddit discovering spree using [this site](http://subredditfinder.com/) which was featured in yesterday's [TIL frontpage](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/b7v6w/til_that_finding_interesting_subreddits_aint_that/). What is amazing is the number of alternative subreddits that exist to cater to similar topics - example, [r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees) [r/marijuana](http://www.reddit.com/r/marijuana) and [r/drugs](http://www.reddit.com/r/drugs) or [r/science](http://www.reddit.com/r/science) and [r/science2](http://www.reddit.com/r/science2) or [r/torrents](http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents), [r/p2p](http://www.reddit.com/r/p2p) and [r/trackers](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers) etc.

Does there exist an automated way to find subreddits using an algorithm that looks for subreddits that share a high percentage of common userbase or something similar to this?

My skills aren't good enough to get this to work with reddit's source code, so I can't make a live demo).

You would be able to fine tune how much of each subreddit you see on your front page. For example, if you're subscribed to minecraft, but don't want to see every one of notch's tweets on your front page, you could ""turn down"" that subreddit, so you only see the posts that have way more upvotes than are typical for that subreddit.

You could also have ""schemes"" or for each configuration. A ""work"" scheme might have r/programming tuned way up, and r/pics tuned down. You'd probably also want to mute r/wtf, r/gaming, and r/politics, as well as any post tagged as NSFW. A ""fap time"" scheme would probably have r/nsfw, and r/gonewild turned up to the max, with everything else muted. You would be able to create a bunch of different schemes, and configure them however you want.

Reddit's current breakdown would be roughly equivalent to setting each subscribed-to subreddit to around 75%. Turning down all the subreddits would be like saying ""I don't get on reddit very often. Show me some of the very best posts from this whole week."" Turning all the sliders to the top is like saying ""I'm on reddit nonstop. Keep giving me new content, as long as it's moderately good. I've already read all the posts that are older than 4 hours. I need my fix of new content."" (A ""master"" slider might also work, unless you're CallMeJordan, the sole moderator and subscriber of [r/master](http://www.reddit.com/r/master/)).

As an added bonus, it would be great if reddit could store which scheme you last used in the browser you're using as a cookie (or HTML5 local storage, whatever). That way, your work computer can stay in your ""work"" scheme, and your home computer can stay on your ""home"" or ""default"" scheme. There should also be some way to change your scheme directly from the home page.

Note: ""mute"" is not the same as ""unsubscribe."" In order for any subreddit to appear in this list, you have to be subscribed to it. Muting a subreddit is used when you don't want to see it in a specific scheme. Tuning the slider all the way down is also not quite the same as ""muting."" A slider at it's minimum would only allow the best of the best posts to break through to your front page.

Also, after I made the mockup, I've realized that it would make more sense to put a setting like this in its own preferences tab, instead of cramming it inside the ""options"" tab where it doesn't really belong."	t5_2qqhi	True

- Encrypt the whole site pending performance issues ([martinmarkovski](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v1e47))

**Discussion:**

I feel they are not getting at the root of the problem though.  

- Is it even feasible?  Perhaps only to a small segment of the population (gold) or as an option (like gmail used to have it)?  ([Aperculum](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v1z1g))

- I disagree with the observation in the post that it's not worth doing since a reddit account is not worth much.  A reputation is built up with an account, and you are adding to a community.  Also, some subreddits would be more inclined to privacy (Trees/IAMA).  Plus a common phenomenon is a reuse of passwords, get somebodies reddit password, and then get into their email (or just get their email). ([robotsongs](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v14uf)/various)

- The performance issues shouldn't be that big of a problem:  
&gt;If you stop reading now you only need to remember one thing: SSL/TLS is not computationally expensive any more.

- More info here: 
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1541818

**Why SSL?**

Encrypting all of Reddit prevents multiple attacks: ([DonutsCureCancer](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v220p)/[snoobie](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v1e1l))

- Doesn't allow you to modify the traffic stream, thus embedding things such as a javascript keylogger, or even an autodownvoter javascript :-P is not possible. ([bl4k](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1542624) from hackernews)

- Can't steal the password when you log in.

- There are also subtler things such as the sslstrip that would be prevented if you implement it in a certain way (taking away the ssl for certain pages) ([theMrDomino](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/ct13j/add_ssl_to_reddit_login/c0v11pi))

**Implementation:**

- Free SSL certs which work with modern browsers:  http://cert.startcom.org/ (thanks to [gschizas](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/ct0w5/community_effort_to_add_ssl_to_major_websites/c0v16pr))

I'm proposing that you use the referrer in a somewhat similar fashion. Any visits to a user page or submission that come directly from /r/SubredditDrama can lead the clicker to a page with the message:

1299692236.0	g0k2f	In addition to an orangered envelope...	cory849	92	8	11	"... I think reddit should put a spool of thread. The spool of thread would go orangered whenever anyone comments in the thread of comments stemming from a comment you posted. 

In addition, put the words ""follow thread"" under each comment. If a user clicks that, it treats that comment the same. His  thread would go orangered if anyone replies to that comment or any comments threading under it. 

I think this could be an important change. Reddit discussions can be very good (I'm on record as saying reddit threading makes for one of the best comment threads on the internet), but they tend to descend into one on one discussions with everyone else leaving the discussion because they figure their comment just won't get seen, or they really want to reply to both sides in a dispute, but just physically can't - and they know there's a good chance the person they don't reply to might not see their response. Basically, reddit threads splinter in a way that challenges third party intervention in a thread of discussion.

An orangered thread would essentially make any thread  act more like a discussion thread on a typical phpbb messageboard, where group discussions are the norm - and valuable. 

I think this would be the best of both worlds - all the power of reddit threading, but with even better discourse. "	t5_2qqhi	True

Pros: it puts the money to good use, incentives celebs to answer more questions like a game show where the prize money goes to charity, and provides a potential reason for more celebs to sign up for AMAs.

1340970792.0	vsi2q	The question of Reddit Inc accepting BitCoin should be re-considered. It is clearly a decision that will give Reddit Inc more monies. 	EquanimousMind	119	39	38	"Revisiting the business logic of Reddit Inc supporting BitCoin

TL;DR Bullet Points:

- Bitcoin services allow merchants to accept btc from customers and instantly convert to USD.

- The BitCoin market has become both stable and liquid; signs that it is beginning to show signs of maturity and critical mass. 

- Reddit has an active BitCoin community that will likely immediately support Reddit Inc accepting BC for Reddit Gold. Instant monies. 

- Reddit Inc support for its BitCoin community will likely drive more users to those communities. More eyes balls. More ads. More Monies. 

- Upside more monies with little downside risk. 

- Cool creds.

So it has been [a year since this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/grz9l/allow_bitcoin_as_an_alternative_payment_for/) was asked. And in that time Bitcoin went through a bubble and pop; but more than that Reddit and Bitcoin are different animals than they were a year ago, so I believe there is value in considering this question again. 

First, this isn't so random a suggestion. Bitcoin has been receiving alot more coverage and this conversation is a natural flow from that momentum. Reddit's sister site Ars had a great article recently:

- [Porn, gambling, and malware: Bitcoin as the 'Net's Wild West. A year after the bubble popped, we check on the cryptocurrency's progress.](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/porn-gambling-and-malware-bitcoin-as-the-nets-wild-west/)

And some other recent coverage:

- [Al-Jazeera English: Understanding Bitcoin](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/05/20125309437931677.html)

- [Bitcoin: Crypto-Anarchism and the Digital Money Revolution](http://www.policymic.com/articles/4980/bitcoin-crypto-anarchism-and-the-digital-money-revolution/category_list)

Okay. Normally, I would go into my evangelist mode and talk about how Bitcoin is important to maintaining freedom of speech online, how it secures the economic bedrock to an eventual free internet, how it develops P2P further, the importance of anonymity blah blah blah BUT I think there is merit in just talking about the economic reasons for Reddit Inc to accept btc for Reddit Gold.

Since accepting btc isn't mutually exclusive to accepting Paypal, this is more a question of how much upside is there for the 1 day it might take to organize. And whether there is enough upside to justify the cost of 1 day? I do believe there is both alot of short and long term financial upside. 

First, there is very little downside risk. Bitcoin doesn't have a concept for charge backs built in. It also doesn't have a concept of Mastercard screwing everyone for middleman services; and in general your looking at around 1% merchant fees. 

The risk that crashed the market last year, was the result of speculation and volatility. While the market has become more stable and liquid, services like Bit-Pay allow merchants to accept BC from customers and automatically convert it to USD. This removes the volatility risk associated with accepting and holding btc. 

- [Bit-Pay Pricing Comparison for E-commerce Sales](https://bit-pay.com/accountingHelp.html)

For most businesses there's a valid question about whether its existing customers even use Bitcoin. Usually the driver to accept btc is in the hopes of targeting new growth from the BC community. But this question is alot easier for Reddit Inc, we know Reddit has a dynamic and growing BC community. If Reddit were to accept BC, I think it is a fair gamble that Bitcoin redditors will have a higher % of Reddit Gold users than other communities. More or less because Reddit's Bitcoin community is crazy passionate about supporting the growth of Bitcoin. In other words, its a business decision that should show instant monies. 

- /r/Bitcoin 

- /r/GirlsGoneBitcoin

- /r/BitMarket 

- /r/bitcoinmining

- /r/decrypto

If the move is supported with a blog post supporting Bitcoin; it should also see interest from the wider Bitcoin community. It should begin a new growth snowball for the Reddit BC subs. This is an interesting spot because Bitcoin is likely to be overlooked as a growth opportunity by the other major social media sites. Reddit might hold its own for now in eyeball sucking AdviceAnimal memes but there's plenty of competition from FB, G+, 9gaga, pinterest, twitter, w.e. So while there are specialist BC community sites, its a market that is likely to overlooked. Which is interesting considering they should be high value users, all they do is talk about money. Should reddit be an early adopter, it should cement its position among the majors social media sites for the BC community. In other words, more users, more eyeballs, more monies. 

While the argument that Reddit Inc would clearly make more monies is airtight /s. This isn't an argument that the Bitcoin market gone mainstream, which is often how the question is framed. Once it is mainstream, it will be obvious to accept btc. But I think the ground is set now that Bitcoin has all the potential to go mainstream. It only needs consumer and business experimentation and adjustment to get there. 

I can't attach probabilities to the above; but I think they make sense. But really in the end, this is an argument that Reddit should lead the charge once again for online freedom. Its good for the internet, its good for business.

So instead of the current system, **why not something similar to the systems Twitter, Tumblr, and Pinterest use?**

For a logged-out user, the visible ""front page"" would be http://www.reddit.com/r/all/top?sort=top&amp;t=day, with NSFW subreddits &amp; posts removed of course.

On account creation, people would get a page, with tools similar to the many sites listed on /r/findareddit's sidebar, asking them to choose their subreddits. Popular ones would be listed as suggestions, along with tools or category listings to find other more obscure ones.

Yes, this might drive away 12-year-olds who can't stay still for five seconds to select a few things to match their interests, but really, are we that desperate for those kind of users anyway?

And the benefits would be huge, no more worrying about defaults overtaking the other subreddits, no more whining about whether a certain subreddit should be defaults, subreddits would rise and fall based on how good they are, obscure subreddits would get a chance to shine like never before, griping about mod censorship would fall to an all-time low with unhindered (and populated) alternatives to strict subreddits everywhere, while on the flip-side griping about a lack of quality would fall as subreddits will be able to enforce rules without being seen as tyrants stifling conversation across all of Reddit, the list goes on and on."	t5_2qqhi	True

1359402216.0	17g252	View user's comments and comment replies in-context	qkme_transcriber	111	39	7	"Hello! I am a bot who posts transcripts of Quickmeme images for anybody who might need them.

I get a lot of comment replies because I post a lot of comments, and I found the comment replies screen to be difficult to use when I have no idea what each reply is replying to, how many replies *it* has, and how its score is doing.

In order to alleviate this shortcoming, I've created some custom javascript to show these comment replies in context (basically, to see the context=3 version of the comment).

It changes my comment replies (orangereds) screen from looking like this:

http://imgur.com/DFfECZG

To looking like this:

http://imgur.com/3hUfZPd

It's much more useful to me, and I imagine would be so to any human who gets a lot of replies. 

After using it for a while, however, I decided it might be useful to apply that same logic to a user's profile or comment history page. After modifying the code to support it, I discovered that **not only is it more useful, it's an entirely elevated experience**.

For an example, here's /u/wil's profile page as it looks normally:

http://imgur.com/6KbwIC7

And here is /u/wil's profile page after running my custom javascript:

http://imgur.com/8BHxnPx

As you can see, instead of seeing a flat and often-confusing list of comments, you get a kind of living history of that user's contributions. You can see what their comment was a reply to, how many replies it has, what the vote score of these nearby comments is, *and it lets you upvote or reply to these nearby comments.*

In short, *it makes browsing a user's comment history (even your own) a much richer experience.*

##Try it yourself

If you are a developer or you know how to run custom javascript in your browser, try this out:

Go to any user profile page (even your own), or your messages screen, and enter this javascript into your browser's console:

     var $messages = $('body.loggedin.messages-page .was-comment.recipient').add('body.profile-page .comment');
     $messages.each(function (iterator, item) {
         var $this = $(item),
             $link = $this.find('a.bylink:first'),
             linkurl = $link.attr('href'),
             subreddit = $this.find('.tagline a:last').text(),
             $title = (($this.find('p.parent').children().length &gt; 0) ? $this.find('p.parent') : $this.find('p.subject a').clone().append(' [' + subreddit + ']').wrap('&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;').parent('h3')),
             context = '?context=3';
         if (linkurl.substr(-10) != context) linkurl += context;
         if (linkurl != undefined) $this.load(linkurl + ' .sitetable.nestedlisting', function () {
             $this.prepend($title)
         });
     });


##What The Code Does

The javascript basically finds any comment on the page that's inside of a profile page or a messages page, finds the ""context"" link for each comment, loads the context link in the background, pulls just the comment section from the context page, and injects it onto the current page in place of the original comment. In effect, it opens a small window into the ""context"" version of each comment.

##Caveat

Doing this breaks the API/Development guidelines for Reddit. It opens many simultaneous requests to Reddit's server with no respect to their 3 second threshold. Please limit your usage of this code as it causes an undue burden on Reddit's servers.

##What I Want

Because this would be impossible to incorporate into RES or a wide-release extension/bookmarklet/userscript, for this to really happen it would need to be implemented by Reddit itself on the back-end.

**I think Reddit should offer a view-comments-in-context option**, perhaps as a Gold feature at first. It could also be offered as a different page within a user's profile page. ""Explore Comments"" or something like that.

Thank you.

1324408533.0	nk6cp	Add a 'Reddit user suggested alternate link' functionality	CocoSavege	94	19	6	"I presume this has been suggested before but I guess it's worth a bump.

Here's the [original context](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/njrbg/the_riaa_pirated_9_million_worth_of_tv_shows/c39nm0n).  

Basically somebody submitted a relatively newsworthy submission however the link was to gizmodo which was just blogspamming the true source, torrentfreak.  AbramsLullaby commented with a direct link to Torrentfreak and this comment was upvoted to the top.  

Here's my suggestion, reposting it here.

I propose a new reddit functionality. If a better URL for a submission is available I propose that it can be submitted and added to the title of the post.

Just a draft for example; something like:

&gt; The RIAA Pirated $9 Million Worth of TV Shows (gizmodo.com)

&gt; Reddit Alternate link (torrentfreak.com)

&gt; (1654 users have proposed the alternate link)

&gt; [+] see more alternate links

The alternate link can have a brief description in the alt text. Something like 'Gizmodo blogspam redirect to source'

Cheers!

I see blogspam as a problem. Not necessarily a big problem but I think a good solution would do good things for the internets. There's a not small amount of people who's entire business model is around blogspamming and (re)(re)(re)submitting content for ad impressions. I'd rather give credit and impressions to source not parasite middlemen.

The guys over at /r/SuicideWatch are a great community. It's amazing hearing the outpouring of support from them for people going through some serious shit.

However, I know that as I visited today while feeling particularly down (I'm fine guys--too much to live for and all--just putting in the context) I started playing one of the sidebar ad games out of habit. It was some game (Terrible Tiny Traps, I believe it was) that involved a whole lot of jumping and dying, and it wasn't really appropriate for the state of mind I was in at the time.

I love reddit--it's a wonderful site, and I don't want to suggest anything to hurt your revenue stream. Gotta pay the bills to keep this site rolling. But, I wonder if would hurt you guys too much to either remove ads in this subreddit or put some targeted links to places to get help in that spot.

Thanks.

Disclaimer 1: I'm not jumping on the ""video games kill people"" bandwagon by any stretch of the imagination--I love 'em and am better for having 'em--but lots of things I think are perfectly fine and appropriate wouldn't be good to hand to people in a fragile state of mind.

It's becoming very hard to keep a handle on bot accounts in the comment sections.

Multiple new accounts are created every day, and unleashed upon the site with little or no regard for the wishes of the moderators or the suitability of the subreddit they are posting to.

I do not see inherent value in allowing unrestricted comment access to these accounts. Most are not useful, and seem to projects by programming students.

I can stand here today and say that I do not want any unapproved bots posting in my subreddits, but I have no way of enforcing this except playing whack-a-mole with banning/filtering.

These accounts will pop up anywhere, under any name.

I consider them very disruptive, they often derail the comments and create a large chain of people talking about the bot (example /u/LinkFixerBot), and spawn malicious copycats (/u/Link_Breaker_Bot).

The comments section is extremely valuable.

----
Some proposals that might make things a bit easier for moderators:


* A bot flag, applied in the /prefs panel. The tickbox would simply mark the account as belonging to a bot.

 * *Pitfall*: Users may flag their own accounts as bots for whatever reason - would have to be very careful that this didn't give them any special advantages, and make them aware of the disadvantages (perhaps a great big glaring banner across the screen would be only viewable by the human).

* A CSS class would be applied to any comment made by the account. It would moderators allow an option to distinguish the group of accounts.

* Moderator control panel options:

  * Bot whitelist, such as the wiki contributors option, or the approved submitters option. Only approved bots may post

  * No bots option, to completely disallow them from posting.

* Recourse for unregistered bots - the ability for users to report them (I'd volunteer /r/reportabusivebots for the purpose, or another one could be created), and a pledge from the administration to ban the accounts.

* High visibility and efforts to make users aware of this change (/r/modnews, /r/changelog, /r/redditdev, /r/announcements posts), and a long grace period.

Edit: I thought I'd edit to show people the issues going on reddit right now thanks to doxxing. 

* User Violentacrez who modded hordes of subreddits deleted his account after being doxxed. 


* User Creepercomforts has deleted his subreddit R/creepshots and his personal information has been doxxed, leaving him very worried that his information will be exposed. 

* R/creepshots was deleted

* R/creepyshots was banned

* Jezebel ran an article with the information of about 20 members/mods of r/creepshots that was doxxed mostly via 
comment history. 

* User DrunkenDonuts being threatened with doxxing by user Crackling_Koala in r/hotrapstories

* User Alexanderr does a bit of doxxing over in r/pitt before deleting the information he made public later on.

1267384918.0	b7jll	Implement more transparency &amp; accountability for the moderators.	dbzer0	70	10	81	"The recent [Saydrah brouhaha](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b72yd/reddit_i_got_a_book_deal_thank_you_the_oatmeal/c0laugg?context=1) has put the possibilities for abuse of mod powers of reddit to the spotlight. A main reason for this is the lack of any transparency and accountability for mod functions which makes a lot of people paranoid on what is going on behind the scenes (and the lately implemented hidden mod chat does not help in this regard). It's stuff like that which lead to witch hunts like this.

I'd like to suggest two things which should prevent mods abusing their power in secret and/or people assuming this is the case and rising up in arms on non-issues.

1. Implement more transparency of mod power via an audit trail. This should be simply a public page which records and displays all mod events happening for all to see. Could look like this:
----

* Mod1 deleted [comment](http://linktocomment) at &lt;time&gt; - Reason: *Blah*
* Mod2 deleted [post](http://linktothread) at &lt;time&gt; - Reason: *Spam*

Or something like this. The reason would be the mod's own input on the act to explain his actions. This would then allow people to see if someone is doing something they shouldn't and call them out on it.

2. Implement more accountability via voting on the mods. This could be done by a) people simply having the capability to go to the list of mods and vote each up or down or b) by voting on their audit trailed actions. 
----

a) This would allow a mod who has become abusive and extremely unpopular to be demodded by public demand, say if they receive 50% downvote by the active members of the subreddit or something. This way power-tripping mods have a way to be stopped from ruining a community.

b) would allow acts which go against the collective will to be undone. A mod actions that receives sufficient downvotes could be then automatically undone by the reddit system and the mod who is continuously having their mod acts undone could then lose their mod status.

These are just suggestions of course and may have many flaws I have not foreseen which is of course why I think it's a good idea to discuss them and see if they can be improved so as to avoid being abused themselves. 

Personally I'd love to see the transparency idea implemented since it's pretty harmless at least and would certainly reduce some of the conspiracy theories and paranoias and certainly act as a roadblock to power-tripping mods."	t5_2qqhi	True

I know the archiving helps with performance, but these styles of subs naturally will have a lower post influx.  Once someone submits a post for a certain item that becomes *the one* post for that movie, show, game, book, or album.

That is, if a submission has less comments, then there's more incentive to post a comment because there's more chance that others will see it.

Conversely, if a submission has a very large number of comments, there's almost no incentive to post your own comment, since there's very little chance that anyone will see it.

If someone discovered a submission late in its life, and had a very informative or hilarious comment to post, they would just not do so, since there's very little chance that it will be seen and consequently upvoted.

I propose the following solution: New comments to a submission with comments over a certain number (Say, 500) should be placed at the top of the comments list for a certain amount of time (Say, 15 minutes).

This will give every new comment on a highly-commented submission a chance to be seen, and will raise the incentive for people to post.

My idea (which I know has been suggested before) is to have a tag available similar to the NSFW tag. It would obscure the thumbnail of a post and put a badge by the title of the post.

Apparently the subreddit search simply looks for the searched term anywhere in the subreddit info (title, description, maybe even sidebar?). I think there needs to be some investment in the subreddit search engine - weighting words in the subreddit name itself (substring), then provisions for a one-line short description, a longer narrative description, keywords, and the sidebar text - all weighted so that folks looking for something tend to find more topical subreddits. Maybe cache these things and search against them all, weighting both against age and duration (So if a thousand subreddits all change their header to ""It's election day, go vote"" it doesn't skew results on ""election"" very much)

Now that I think about it, I poured a huge part of my inner world in here. I'd like to know that my text is still accessible to me no matter what happens to reddit. 

Will reddit be online in 10 years? How about 30 years. Will they care about the heritage of comments and posts we created here?

Ok, that is why I am asking if I can liberate my data. I'd like to download all pages where I commented or voted, ever since I started using the site under a user name.

You might want to point out that I could click my user name and see the history in there, but I don't think the rabbit hole goes all the way. I think it is cut off at 1000 items or some random limit.

**Edit**: I confirmed that the cutoff point is somewhere at 57 pages deep, exactly 6 months time span. No comments before that moment are accessible any more, but submitted links are visible back until 4 years ago.

So, I want to ask you:

1. Is this an issue we care about or is it just me?

2. Is there an already worked out system to get one's personal data out?

I hope you will not dismiss this out of hand. At least one user cares deeply about his reddit legacy, and there is a non zero chance that many users do. If I died tomorrow, my kids would be able to read my thoughts on hundreds of issues. It's the modern day version of a journal - if I could get my hands on it.

Wouldn't it be great if we could use IMAP or something to pull our history in a similar way we can get out Gmail emails out?

Even if it was just one dedicated server used for this purpose and I had to wait 24 hours for the data to be prepared, it'd still be OK.

Many of these don't work outside the subreddit, rendering them useless for anyone on r/all, or with custom styles disabled, or using a reddit mobile app, or reading messages in their inbox.

Subreddits are also overloading the NSFW toggle to mean SPOILERS, making it impossible to distinguish between spoilers and truly NSFW links.  This is also terrible.

1269560987.0	bibqu	As a moderator, one thing I'd like to see implemented is some on-site mechanism for drawing attention to less trafficked subreddits.	blackstar9000	49	0	14	"Basically, it seems to me like moderators have to work especially hard to push niche subreddits beyond a certain subscribership threshold, and that, after a while, you get diminishing returns.  Maybe that's just an interest thing -- after a while, you get most or all of the people who would be interested in a given subreddit subscribed, and there's simply not many more potential subscribers out there.  But I'd say it's hard to be sure about that, in part because reddit doesn't really provide an on-site mechanism for drawing attention to subreddits that aren't already in the top 12 or so.

There are a couple of off-site mechanisms, like subredditfinder.com, but those require you to go, well, off-site, and I think there's some inertia against that, since reddit is branded as a kind of one-stop clearing house for interesting places to go.  The problem is, how do you know where to go *on reddit* for interesting links.  And ultimately I think that results in subscriber pooling -- people don't really know to about a lot of the other small but active subreddits on reddit, so the already popular subreddits end up with swollen pools of subscribers who are essentially inactive.

There was a period there where subreddits were getting ads in the sidebar.  I remember one specifically for /r/bacon.  Don't know if those were paid or what, but they never ranged beyond a few mid-size subreddits.

A better solution, I think, might be to have a box, similar to the one for promotions and announcements at the top of the front page, that cycles through submissions from lesser trafficked subreddits.  It could be put at the bottom of the front page, after the top-rated headlines from the user's subscribed subs, so that it remains relatively unobtrusive.  Each time you reloaded it would show the top-rated headline of that day from a subreddit that you're not already subscribed to.  That would give every user at least one chance to see subreddits -- and actual content from those subreddits -- that they might not otherwise see without having to either go off-site or spend hours (like I have) digging thorough the subreddit listings.

Inclusion in the pool of sampled subreddits could be a toggle feature in the moderator's permissions for each subreddit.  That way, some subreddits can opt out if they'd like.  And users could set it to filter out NSFW material.

Otherwise, I think you guys are doing a fantastic job.  Thanks."	t5_2qqhi	True

1336197631.0	t81lp	An appeal to the admins.	blackstar9000	57	15	40	"Several of you know me from my stint as the mod of /r/TheoryOfReddit, and I assume that those who do saw me struggle to keep the scope of that sub focused on grass-roots solutions – strategies for improving Reddit that users and mods could implement without having to burden the admins with requests. I still think that's the best-case scenario for the site's total community, but unlike a year or ever six months ago, I no longer think it's all that feasible.

Part of the reason for the shift in my opinion is the friction I ran up against in trying to get /r/advocacy up and running. Not the objections of other redditors – those subsided pretty quickly, and there were enough supporters that I could deal with a little resistance. A more substantial difficulty was in trying to coordinate with other subs. That sort of coordination was essential for the service /r\/advocacy was intended to provide, but more importantly, it's been growing increasingly essential for other new subs as well.

The common wisdom around Reddit is that just about any problem can be solved by creating a new sub. I've definitely started my share of alt subs to provide outlets for submissions that don't quite fit into the default set. And once upon a time, it was relatively easy to do that and make a moderate success of it. I think that's changed. We've hit some sort of critical mass.

The gist of it is that it's no longer really feasible to get anywhere on Reddit without some sort of boost from one of the defaults. All of the subs I've seen go from tiny to mid-sized in the past year have done so on the strength of popular shout-outs in a default – usually AskReddit or /r/games. Moreover, grass-roots initiatives to improve Reddit cannot succeed without some sort of push from one or more defaults, and with the moderation teams of those defaults struggling to keep up, luck plays a decisive role precisely where we should want collaboration and determination to do the lion's share.

The reason for all of this is simply that the defaults are huge, and getting bigger, largely on the strength of their states *as* defaults. They get new subscribers every time new people join the site, and because they provide the bulk of the material on the front page, Reddit is increasingly attracting people who are interested in the defaults, almost to the exclusion of the rest of the site. The increase from ten to twenty defaults back in October seemed like a good interim solution at the time, but in retrospect, I think it may have only exacerbated the problem by giving just enough variety to squelch newcomers' curiosity about the rest of the site.

I know this is something that's been on your radar for a while, and yes, I realize that it's difficult to come up with an ideal solution. What I'm asking here is that you stop looking for the ideal and simply rip the bandaid off.

The best solution I can think of is simply this: Pare the default set down to a single sub. Call it something like /r\/GettingStarted. It will be restricted, and have only one submission, explaining to new users why their front page has no links, and what they can do to customize their subscriptions.

The effect is to put new users through the crash course in subscriptions. Without something of the sort, the default set is only going to get bigger and bigger, and user- and mod-level efforts to improve Reddit, not to mention attempts to build strong communities without the backing of defaults, is only going to grow more difficult."	t5_2qqhi	True

Message thanks to Timmyaberoth:

DEAR ADMINS

There shouldn't be defaults on a website that is supposed to be neutral, whether its r/politics or r/gaming or whatever.
Saying ""we make it default because its popular"" is a bad idea and subreddits that have oped out like r/bestof are proof that, when they oped out their content got so much better.
Admins its really not about the r/atheism vs r/atheism haters. You added a front page so people could customise and not have to go to r/all but the problem wasn't that, the problem is the defaults have an ever growning advantage of what gets popular.
6 months ago f7u12 had 100k more subs than r/atheism now r/atheism is double the size of f7u12 its not about content they got that because they are default.

1354088441.0	13xa8j	Remove defaults. Implement a new algorithm that takes other things into consideration for the front page.	twentyone_21	59	14	34	"###The current issue:  
The Reddit community is currently precipitating in an unhealthy manner. It is becoming very top-heavy in where users are active. It might become unsustainable soon. There will be too many users that cannot find what they wish to find deep within Reddit, because so much of the site is congregated around 20 subreddits. Interests of the users will not and cannot be served because sooner or later, more and more users will not find what topics or subreddits interest them. [This is backed up by statistics on subreddit growth.](http://stattit.com/subreddits/by_subscriber_gain_1w/) Currently, the lowest ranking default, /r/atheism, has over twice the amount of subscribers as /r/askscience, which has the highest amount of subscribers of any non-default subreddit (mainly because it was once a default). There is currently no reasonable chance that a non-default subreddit can beat a default subreddit in terms of activity or subscribers.

###A bleak future:  
The current system of congregation into default subreddits is causing Reddit to splinter into many offshoot subreddits. Some users are so deep in the meta/real/true/republicof hole that they do not even participate in the default subreddits. This is a sign that Reddit is getting so top-heavy that people are falling off. Participating in a community with so many voices and differing opinions makes your own opinions feel small and unimportant. You may start to enjoy other people's voices in the community less. This might happen until you find a smaller, niche subreddit that fits your interests. This splintering practice will continue to where finding what you actually desire is impossible. This is not a bad practice, if there was enough traffic to support the splintering, but since defaults are not directing new users to smaller subreddits in comparable numbers, the community will not sustain. Say, for instance, you wish to find about a subreddit about a genre of music that you like, that isn't very popular? Well, there's r/music, r/yourgenre, r/yourgenre2, r/trueyourgenre, r/theoryofyourgenre, r/metayourgenre, r/republicofyourgenre, r/realyourgenre, etc. /r/Music was the default, but that doesn't feature your favorite genre, and not many people there appreciate your style. The subreddits that feature your favorite genre are spread so thin because of the splintering, that there are not many contributors for any of them. You know that most users that enjoy your musical tastes will never find this small group of niche subreddits because of how congregated Reddit is in the defaults. The same splintering happened with Usenet in the 90s. The hierarchies' groups became so cluttered into the ""generalized"" groups that people splintered off. This eventually led to a disconnected community, that could hardly be called a community anymore. The same thing is happening with Reddit, except worse. Now, this inevitably happens as communities grow larger. Larger groups become unsustainable. But, the problem is aggravated by having default subreddits. The large communities become larger by a method of the site's construct. Sooner or later, after severe splintering, people will no longer want to be a part of such a cluttered, condensed mass of minds, and they will find a more niche website that better suits their interests.

###A reasonable solution:  
First, remove all ""defaults."" Make the non-signed in (default) homepage like /r/all without NSFW content (like the current home page, yet with more than 20 subreddits). Make new users' homepages the same, with the option to have NSFW content if they check ""yes"" that they are 18+. This home page should also occasionally feature popular submissions to smaller subreddits as well, but subreddits should have the option of whether or not they should be automatically featured.  
Second, monitor the user's voting habits. If they upvote a few posts from a subreddit, make a floating box that asks them if they would like to ""subscribe"" to the subreddit, where more of its content will be featured on your homepage than other subreddits. Downvotes to a few posts from a subreddit will open up a floating dialog that will ask if they want to remove that subreddit from being on your frontpage.  
Third, after a decent profile of subscriptions (or maybe even one) is created, make a sidebar that features related subreddits that they might want to feature on their homepage. Once a long list of upvotes, downvotes, subscriptions, and removes from homepage is created, then have those things play into the sidebar suggestions for smaller niche subreddits that are more aligned with their interests. Users should have the option to only feature subscribed subreddits on their homepage, if they desire.

###Rationale:  
This will help spread Reddit to be less top-heavy. Smaller subreddits will be more exposed than usual. Users can find content that interests them more easily through a suggestion box. The ease of creating an account and using Reddit is not hindered, but probably improved. This could provide more ease as subreddits they wanted to find, but did not know existed, are on the homepage."	t5_2qqhi	True

Instead of yelling and downvoting them, people would see they're a new user and explain how things work.

It would also be useful for identifying spammers or shills. I've seen cases where a post title is heavily sensationalized or an outright lie but it gets upvoted until someone points out the account is new with only a single post to a spammy blog. Seeing that a user is new without having to view all user account pages would subject the posts to more scrutiny from average users. As a result, I suspect more spam would be buried."	t5_2qqhi	True

* For each user, store the date that they last subscribed to each of the subreddits they're currently subscribed to

* (Upon implementing the feature, set that value, for each user for each of their subscribed subreddits, to 24 hours before ""now"", or further back)

* When a user unsubscribes from a subreddit, clear that value entirely

* Add an option in subreddits' settings for ""disallow votes from users that have been subscribed for less than 24 hours"" (defaulting to off) - or, alternatively, for less than a variable, moderator-settable number of days (or hours or whatever)

* Option A: In subreddits opting into this feature, don't count votes that are cast if the user's ""last subscribed"" value is less than 24 hours old - show the buttons, but essentially don't have them *do* anything; don't store the vote at all

* Option B: In subreddits opting into this feature, don't give vote arrows at all for users who shouldn't be able to vote

Obviously for both options there'd need to be a change to the vote-storing code to make sure people weren't submitting votes with, like, external buttons or whatever. Option A would probably be simplest in that it wouldn't, presumably, require any changes to the code that displays the voting arrows.

This would lessen the impact of meta-subreddits and brigading on vote counts in a couple of different ways:

1. It would require, if people wanted to vote on linked threads, that they essentially subscribe *ahead* of time - and *stay* subscribed if they wanted to vote there in the future - or else subscribe when they saw whatever it was, and then vote the following day; and I feel like for most people that did this, being subscribed to a bunch of subreddits they didn't actually care about would become too irritating, and they'd give it up - essentially, the cost of voting on things linked by meta-subreddits would become too high for most users to care to do it

2. For a lot of people, they wouldn't even realize it was happening - at least under Option A

This obviously would have less of an effect on default subreddits, to which a greater number of meta-subreddit users are presumably subscribed.

It would also protect smaller subreddits who periodically have submissions that reach the front page."	t5_2qqhi	True

SquashMonster	48	5	10	"Each subreddit gets a parent reddit.  The specific ones go to a more general topic: for example, Java and Haskell have Programming as their parents.

Since the more specific subreddits get less viewers than the more general ones, they also yield less upvotes, and these won't overwhelm the their (more general) parents.

This is a little more restrictive than tags, but much easier for the  submitter: you just submit to the most specific subreddit you know about.  Conveniently, with this system in place, submitting to a highly specific subreddit is also the way to get the most eyes on your submission, so karma-seekers will want to go along with it (contrast with now, where you want to aim at the biggest subreddit that will notice).

1375891734.0	1jw2ic	Tool for Subreddits to Limit Submissions Per User Over A Period of Time	nwestnine	47	5	18	"Some major subreddits consistently have posts from a small group of users dominating their front pages.

An example is /r/politics.  Right now, 12 of the top 50 come from just 4 users.  These 4 users have submissions reach the top 50 almost daily.  There are a few others that have a consistent presence there everyday.  These users make very few comments.  And, these users have similar presences on other subreddits.

While it's not necessarily vote manipulation or spam, it does give the sense that content is somehow being curated.  This can discourage average users from wanting to submit- what's the point if there's no chance of it reaching the top?

A tool to limit submissions from each user would help solve this.  The ability for mods to set daily, weekly or monthly caps allows the freedom for each sub to impose their own unique rules specific to their case (or not use it at all).

*Side Note:  Facebook has similar limits.  They have a limit on the number of friends.  They look at the number and time of day of posts/comments.  If a combination of limits are hit (don't know the exact formula), their account is suspended for a month.

And the only reason the admins have ever cited for not fixing it is that it could create a situation where mods could abuse the system by marking a post as spam and then rescuing it over and over again, essentially keeping the post perpetually in the new queue. But this little problem can EASILY be avoided by differentiating between posts marked as spam automatically by the filters, or by mods. Generally, if a mod decides a post is spam there is probably something wrong with it. But the spam filters are incredibly finicky and often give false positives. When a mod rescues a post from the spam filters, it should not be penalized.

When a post is flagged by the spam filters, this only happens once per post. If a mod rescues it, it could be sent right back to the top of the new queue. Then, if a second mod comes along and marks it as spam again manually, it will head back to the spam queue. But if the first mod comes back and tries to rescue it again, it will retain its age.

Does this make sense? I really don't understand why this has not been instituted yet, and it is really getting on my nerves. All it would take is a single binary field in the database. 0 by default, and 1 if a mod marks the post as spam. If the field = 0, reset the post date. If it = 1, don't reset the post date.

The clicks on this button for a particular submission could, through a fairly simple algorithm, approximate the date and popularity of this link when it was last submitted.  Reddit's sorting algorithm could then use this information to hide it from users who were around when it was last submitted.

More specifically, the following information would be tracked:

 * The **age** of a user – if a user seenits several submissions estimated to be about eight months old, but nothing earlier than that, this user is deemed to be about eight months old (this is more effective than simply using the age of their profile, as many redditors lurked long before they committed to an account)
 * The **depth** of a user – if a user seenits several submissions within their age range estimated to have been around the third page of reddit, but nothing deeper than that, they are estimated to be a three-page-deep redditor
 * The **recency** of a submission – if a submission is seenit'd by many users estimated to be about four months old, but by no users estimated at three months old, the submission is deemed to a have a recency of four months
 * The **popularity** of a submission – if a submission estimated at five months old is seenit'd by several six-page-deep redditors, but few four- or five-page-deep redditors, it is deemed to have been around sixth-page popular

The algorithms to determine this information would be fairly simple (I could provide them if necessary).  Since they rely on one another, they would take a couple weeks to get reasonably accurate, but would quickly become rather steady.  With this information tracked, **submissions would be hidden from a user if they are within both that user's depth range and age range**.  Ideally, this wouldn't be a binary hide/show, it would just factor into reddit's scoring algorithm for submissions which determines what lands on the front page.

This happens to inherently factor in a bunch of stuff that it should: if a particular user seenits everything, he/she will be deemed very old, and his seenits will not have a very large effect on others; if an old user doesn't mind reposts, he/she won't seenit anything and will be marked as young, thus allowing him/her to see reposts just like any new user.

Thoughts?  Improvements?  Complaints?

**EDIT:** People don't seem to want to read through the entire explanation, so I'll summarize as follows: whether you like reposts, dislike reposts, are a new user, are an old user, read just the first page of reddit, or read twenty pages deep, this method would algorithmically ensure that you see reposted content you want to see and don't see reposted content you don't want to see."	t5_2qqhi	True

At the moment they're automatically reposting GW content in /r/ass so it's a bit easier for us to deal with the mod queue: titles that include [f] are spam, so we don't have to check the age of their accounts anymore before we delete their posts, but it's very frustrating..

I think this spam problem can easily be solved if there was some sort of option to set a restriction to your subreddit for the submitters to be at least xx days old.

However, there is an edge case in which users can neither see nor delete their own content, which is when they are removed as an approved submitter from a private subreddit.

If a user makes embarrassing revelations in a private subreddit, and they are removed, then that evidence will remain visible to all the users of that sub unless the content is deleted by moderators, and will remain visible to the moderators of the sub in perpetuity.

If that content represents doxxing information, or embarrassing personal details, then I don't think it is fair that the user is disallowed from editing or deleting it.

1280712460.0	cw8i9	Reset the clock on submissions released from the spam filter	AgentConundrum	37	7	5	"I'm not a spammer (well, not anymore anyway - I used to submit things I wrote on my blog, per the reddiquette, to reddit where they would do poorly. Some might call that a form of spamming.), but a lot of the time reddit treats me like one. It's at the point where I'm seriously considering throwing away this account and starting fresh. The only reason I haven't is that the account is four years old, and that's a point of pride for me.

Anyway, sometimes I post things that get caught in the spam filter, and I decide it's worth the hassle of PMing an admin. Depending on the reddit, this could take a while (I'm currently waiting on /r/programming mods to let a submission out, and it's been about two hours so far) and a lot of posts can get submitted to that reddit in the meantime.

Since posts only have a short time to prove themselves in the 'new' queue, waiting on a moderator can kill your submission just as effectively as the spam filter can. Resubmitting just leaves you in the spam filter again.

I think it would be cool if submissions caught by the spam filter, when released from it, would have their ""submission time"" reset so that the submission appears to be brand new, giving it proper time to prove itself in the 'new' queue.

User flair is pretty neat. What I think we need now is the same thing, but for submissions and with the addition of the poster being able to chose the ""post flair"" options (which a mod would set up prior) right from the submit page.

Usage example: In [/r/freebies](/r/freebies) there have been [several](http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/h7s5k/can_we_make_an_available_in_tag/) [requests](http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/il4jf/hiya_fellas_would_it_be_reasonable_for_me_to_ask/) to be able to tag a post as being valid in Country X only (usually USA only but not always). I've BSed [something](http://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/h8jc7/availability_indicators/) together so they can add the tags via a comment or from within a self post but they don't seem to like it much... probably because having to go back to do that is annoying. That announcement post is pretty much the only place I've seen anyone use them.

If there were a way for the poster (and a mod, so posts can be retroactively tagged if the poster forgets) to add such ""post flair"" it would be precisely what they've been asking for.

There is a [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/b6zte/folks_if_you_link_to_a_webcomic_they_like_is_it/) about how we should be linking to the original source and posting mirrors in the comments. Well I have been modded down for linking IMGUR mirrors in the articles before and this is a very sloppy way to handle mirroring.

I want mirrors because they are typically on websites I trust, like IMGUR. I don't care if I get karma for posting a mirror comment, but I certainly don't want to get modded down for trying to make the internet a better place.

My suggestion is that Reddit implements a way of enabling mirrors to be added robustly. Also, these should have votes on them that give no karma, but will remove the mirror if it is voted down too many times, and maybe limit the number of mirrors to 5 of the top voted ones.

The best way to do this I think is to simply list them as [Mirror 1][Mirror 2][Mirror 3][Mirror 4] so that we don't have to click a link to get to the mirrors.

There are a few reasons for doing it this way:

* So Redditors can see the article if their workplace blocks it.
* In case the article is taken down by the original source for any reason.
* In case the [Slashdot effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect) hits (ok probably safe to call this the Reddit effect now but still... :)
* User preference: I would personally prefer to see something on IMGUR than the source, just because I know them and trust them. I am NOT going to visit Huffington Post. Sorry.

I'm a mod at [/r/asoiaf](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf). We don't really have a problem with NSFW content there, but we do have a problem with people failing to properly tag their posts with [SPOILER] warnings.

I know this probably sounds like a petty issue, but the A Song of Ice and Fire series of books by George R. R. Martin is full of major twists and turns.

Right now all I can do is remove the post in question. I hate doing that.

I would LOVE IT if there was a ""spoiler"" button I could hit, to mark a post as having spoilers. Like with the NSFW button, it would give the post a ""SPOILER"" badge to warn readers that the post they're about to read is spoiler-ish.

1289051789.0	e24pq	URL shorteners?		41	10	25	"I spent a couple hours surfing /new this morning at a time which also happened to coincide with a wave of spam from goo.gl.

A couple of the (very much appreciated) folks from r/reportthespammers helped me make a bookmarklet for reporting spammer accounts. During our discussion, I pondered this...

Why not ban URL shorteners altogether? There's no point in them being submitted to reddit. Allow me to illustrate by example.

Let's say I'm hanging out on IRC somewhere and someone gives me a shortened URL (they're very common in text-based interactive systems IRC/MUD-family) to bit.ly, goo.gl, tinyurl or whatever. Before I know whether or not I want to submit it to reddit, I have to load it in my browser... which results in a redirect to the actual URL which, in turn, is now in my browser's address field for easy copying to reddit.

URL shorteners have no place in reddit's submission process. I suggest banning them.

Just my $.02.

EDIT: raldi has requested specific links where a url shortener has been used to redirect spam. This is difficult for me at this time (see our conversation below), because the ones I reported (to r/reportthespammers) had their accounts deleted. So, if you partake in reporting spammers, please consider submitting any of the ORIGINAL POSTS (using a url shortener/redirect to a spam site) somewhere in this thread. That is: POST THE URL (e.g., http://goo.gl/foo) here, so that it can be proven that this is, indeed, what is occurring... and was occurring for a few hours this morning (I'm estimating a couple hundred such links were posted this morning in under 2 hours - about 1 out of every 4 submissions for a brief while).

A button similar to the NSFW button would be much appreciated. All you'd have to do is click the spoiler button and the post would have a spoiler thumbnail.

Right now, most subs redesign the NSFW button to say SPOILER. The problem is that from the front page, the post still says NSFW since the subreddit's css can't affect the frontpage. So people come in and ask why something that isn't NSFW is marked as such. This becomes a nuisance around the 50th time.

On top of that, there are some posts that are genuinely NSFW. If the NSFW button ended up being redesigned, how will people get a clear warning that something is NSFW?

CedarWolf	30	2	4	"Moderators could really benefit from a ""note"" box in the moderation log and in the banned users list. In the moderation log, it will show that a moderator has changed the sidebar or has changed the subreddit stylesheet... but it provides no information on *why* or what changes were actually made. If a user is added to or removed from approved submitter status, other moderators have no way of knowing why unless they ask the other mods directly in modmail.

This can really clutter the modmail pretty quickly.

The banned users list would benefit from a note section so other moderators could see *why* someone was banned. This would also allow subreddits who use a temporary banning system or a warning system to keep track of users who have multiple warnings or who have a two-week ban. Moderators would be able to post links to the banned users' offending posts, which would allow other mods to see *why* someone was banned.

Similarly, a change log on the CSS page would be *exceedingly useful.*

**I think no longer automatically subscribing new users to whatever ten subreddits are currently the most active would solve a lot of problems.**

Instead, the default front page would be /r/all. Users could then cherry-pick subreddits they like to build their very personal front page(s).

Benefits?

* Right now, the ten most active subreddits are automatically flooded with new users that might not even have a special interest in them. This drives the quality of those subreddits down. This would stop.

* Most users probably don't even realize now that there's so much more to Reddit than the ten most active subreddits. In /r/all, many more than the ten most popular subreddits are represented. Just looking at the first few pages there are submissions from */r/atheism, /r/trees, /r/f7u12, /r/technology, /r/tf2, /r/australia, /r/Minecraft, /r/vertical, /r/aww, /r/firstworldproblems, /r/Art, /r/math, /r/space, /r/sex, /r/starcraft, /r/canada, /r/AdviceAnimals, /r/movies, /r/itookapicture, /r/4chan, /r/scifi, /r/harrypotter, /r/news, /r/wow, /r/gifs, /r/survivorzero, /r/geek, /r/TwoXChromosomes, /r/googleplus, /r/DIY, /r/circlejerk, /r/comicbooks...* All of them are not top ten subreddits.

* Every submission, not matter from which subreddit, can theoretically make it to the top of /r/all. People overly concerned with karma could finally start posting in the smaller, more appropriate subreddits. Fantastic submissions to smaller subreddits would no longer have to be cross posted to get noticed.

* Reddit is currently very fragmented. Having /r/all as default frontpage would somehow bring the community back together, while the personalized front page(s) would allow for a very personal experience.

* It would make it much easier for new subreddits to get noticed.

1371457465.0	1gi71w	Giving moderators the option to anonymously approach a random group of subscribers for survey purposes.	creesch	76	48	11	"As it is now we as moderators have almost no valid way of conducting a survey simply because of self selection bias, visibility of the survey and plenty of other points. This is a problem if you want to incorporate the opinion and feelings of your user base in your subreddit policy in a honest and somewhat objective manner. 

A simple solution would be to give the mods of a subreddit the ability to approach a group of their users in order to conduct a survey. 

### Privacy 

In order to ensure the privacy of the users the mods should not be able to see who the survey was send to and who did respond. 

Additionally users could be given a option in their preferences that would exclude them from receiving these requests.

### How would the surveys be conducted?

Ideally reddit would provide the tools but otherwise limit it to certain services like google forms, survery monkey, Qualtrics or SurveyPro. 

### Who should be selected? 

Ideally the option would suggest a [group big enough to be representative enough](http://blog.surveymonkey.com/blog/2011/09/15/how-many-people-do-i-need-to-take-my-survey/) for the questions you want to ask. 

Additionally it should be a group of users that have been active in the past month in order to make sure it is a active group of subscribers. 

### Abuse? 

In order to limit abuse sending out a survey should be limited to once per month or an other period so users can not be spammed with survey requests from a subreddit. 

### Other. 

Since getting a feel for the users opinion is mostly a issue for large subreddits and also to limit issues with a to small dataset it is probably wise to limit this ability to subreddits over a certain size. I personally think 5k or 10k is probably a good threshold. "	t5_2qqhi	True
1369013866.0	1eo141	As a mod, I would like a way to keep our threads out of /r/all, or remove them once they get there, because people in /r/all are often jerks	brucemo	40	12	18	"I am a mod of /r/Christianity, which is an insular community that is largely left alone by Reddit, because religion is boring.

Our problem is that sometimes someone in our sub will say something interesting, but they are trying to say something interesting to us, not the world, but because it's interesting the world notices, and the world contains people who come into our sub and cause problems.

The typical thread there is not up-voted very highly, and it's possible for people to express themselves without getting on the world's radar.

Every once in a while, someone will say something poignant or fascinating or weird or something, and it will get a lot of up-votes from within our community, and all hell breaks loose.

The problem is that once it starts getting high enough in /r/all, people from outside our community tends to see it, and these people are often jerks. ""Oh, a highly voted thread in /r/Christianity! Yay! Time to say something heinous in order to hurt someone!""

One example was a picture someone took of his father's Bible. The guy's father is a pastor, and he had used a highlighter and a fibre tip pen to mark the Bible up beyond belief. There was one page that was *completely* marked up, and OP had taken a picture of it and posted it.

Images are crack cocaine, and that one was interesting, so it got a lot of up-votes in our community, and it made it into /r/all where it got more, and that evening I removed over 100 comments from people telling our OP that his father was insane.

Another case was yesterday. Someone's father died, he asked for prayers, which is just something Christians do, and people up-voted this thread for some reason, and it got into /r/all, and I ended up banning some douchenozzle who suggested that our OP should die as well.

Who needs this nonsense? I don't need this nonsense.

So, I would like one or both of the following if possible:

1. The ability for a mod (or even a submitter, I don't care), to remove a thread from /r/all. As is now I have to either nurse these threads or remove them, unless I want to deal with dozens of comments from misanthropic wads, which runs counter to the idea that our sub should be someplace where people can go to get help, rather than the trite little abuse-nuggets that are so common elsewhere on Reddit.

2. The ability to prevent all of our threads from getting into /r/all in the first place, if we should choose.

Thank you,

1357180690.0	15v460	An idea to help us throw a spotlight on quality submissions: The 'Curated' tab.	evilnight	33	4	38	"It's a pretty simple idea. There are a lot of quality submissions, as shown by the results everyone has come up with for bestof2012. How useful it would be if there were a way for members of a subreddit to save their best content off into a separate area, so that people just arriving could get a look at the best, and so people can put all of their best content into one place to find it again.

We've got tabs already for Hot, New, Top, and Controversial. I'd like to add one called Curated. It doesn't work quite like the others... instead, it's more of a subreddit-specific Saved list just like users here already have.

The moderators, or possibly a new group called curators, have the ability to add anything in their subreddit to this curated tab so it is easy to find again. The difference here is that everyone can see it, unlike your own saved items which are just for you. It might also be interesting if posts that were added would show up a little differently in search results, just an asterisk or something to indicate that the post is considered one of the best in whatever community it was created.

What I think this does for us is make it easy to find a subreddit's best content. You might say that is already done by the top/all-time page, but I'd beg to differ. Quality does not necessarily correlate with upvotes. Submissions in high-turnover subreddits get lost in the wind all the time.

There are other uses for this as well beyond just a bestof capacity. For example, in listentothis we could use it as a way to highlight the artists we find compelling despite them often being buried and ignored due to our rapid submission rate, making them more accessible and giving us a better way to separate the wheat from the chaff a little more effectively. 

Sure, this could be done by adding and editing a page on the wiki, but that takes a great deal more effort than simply clicking on 'curate' under a submission. Perhaps we want to tag things as above average all week long, and then make a major edit to a wiki page on the weekend when we have more time available.

I can think of a lot of use cases for this. It doesn't seem like it would be particularly hard to do since the capabilities it would use are already available. Thoughts?

---

Editing in a blurb about why we would want to do this from discussions below...

Think of it this way. You hit up /r/nfl, click curated, and there are all of the game day threads and important news articles (same for all other sports subs). Hit up /r/gameofthrones and under curated you find all of the episode discussion threads, cast AMAs, and really interesting discussions. Ditto for all TV show subreddits. Hit up /r/gaming and suddenly you're looking at all of the major game release threads. Hit up /r/f7u12 and under the curated tabs, everything there *actually makes you laugh for a change.* Over in /r/wtf you have to give up after five posts because they really are WTF and now your head hurts. Drop by my corner in /r/listentothis and find a cornucopia of *quality* obscure musicians to spend your dollars on and improve the awesomeness of your mp3 playlists 1000%. Hit up /r/askscience and read the most intelligent or exciting questions at a glance, visit /r/pics to see some really amazing photos, hit up /r/iama and find nothing but the best interviews.

It's like you are creating, in each subreddit, the *illusion* that everything there is top quality, and suddenly it's like browsing the fabled reddit of old where there are no crappy submissions. The content moves slower, but it is better, and you can take a 2 week vacation and come back to easily find the good submissions that you missed. You get a long-view of the subreddit, rather than the fast moving one from the main tabs.

It's not the same as the top pages, either. Top-all time never changes. Top-week only gives you what was most upvoted, *not the submissions that are considered the best by curators.* In some subs those will be virtually the same, in others they will be radically different.

If you get a shitload of heavily upvoted posts (like askreddit does) you won't want to add all of them to the curated tab, just the exceptional ones. They get a lot of repeating questions, for example. If you have a ton of content that barely gets voted on at all (like /r/music), you might want to add the overlooked gems to the curated tab. Their mods have tried creating weekly music digest posts, for example, but they can't stop them from being buried. Both ways, it'll be completely different from the top pages. Different subs, different content, different methods, but probably all with quality in mind.

One other difference I forgot to mention... acting as a 'saved' page, it is indexed by *time* and not by *vote totals.* This is very useful for catching up on things you may have missed, like mod announcements that didn't get heavily upvoted as happens all the time. The most recent addition is always at the top. This dovetails with some of the use cases for the 'sticky thread' feature discussed elsewhere.

---

Now, all of that *can* happen with a wiki and I'm sure it will in a few places. I contend that with a Curated tab, it becomes inevitable in *every* subreddit due to the sheer ease of a single mouse click. It becomes impossible *not* to use it. Using it is as easy as upvoting a post.

Maybe that explains what I'm seeing in my head a little better. Yes, it's a bit elitist, but that's the point. It will also shut up everyone complaining about crap content and make reddit's IQ look a little better to the rest of the internet. New subscribers can get an instant look at what a sub is about, and it's a lot harder for the roving squads of trolls out there to misrepresent and tarnish a subreddit's image.

You might notice a few things, but what I want to point out is the enormous difference in votes between the #1 submission and all other submissions. That's how /r/worldpolitics and most other medium sized subreddits look almost every day.

How does it happen? Most of the subscribers of a subreddit don't actually visit the subreddit. They only vote on their front page. Obviously, the most popular submission of a subreddit will get the most votes from the front page. This is getting amplified by [how the submissions from different subreddits are weighted on the front page](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/r5q66/whats_the_opinion_on_weighted_subreddits_these/c43eil2). *The more votes the #1 submission is getting, the lower all other submissions from that subreddit will rank on the front page.* This basically puts the #1 submission in ""invincibility mode"" and it stays #1 until it ""dies of old age"" somewhere around 20h in its lifetime and another submission lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time takes its place. Then the whole process repeats itself.

One possible solution would be to change the weight to something more constant than the number of votes of the current #1 submission, using the average subreddit activity would be an example.

Why not code up a page that lists recent threads that were popular before reddit went down? Maybe have a script that looks for top recent threads every few hours and updates the down page. Instead of letting bored redditors beat the servers down even further with their F5 keys, preoccupy them with stuff they might be looking at anyway. 

A similar approach would be just some links that the admins have enjoyed recently.

What ever happened to read-only mode? The few times it happened, I didn't mind it one bit. Obviously that's more traffic-intensive than a single down page, but certainly that must have eased server load by a good bit.

Charity donation links would be nice too. Maybe not the *only* thing on the page, but putting them there somewhere would probably help.

Previous thread:

* [From Sept, 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/kub45/admins_please_provide_an_update_on_the_abusive/).
* [Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/i6wlz/admins_lets_really_talk_about_abusive_users/c21iv8x) from /u/spladug in June, 2011.  [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/i6wlz/admins_lets_really_talk_about_abusive_users/) to that whole thread. 
* [Another important thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/i2lyy/some_consistent_policy_on_abusive_behaviour_on/) about the issue.   
* Yes, it's a bit of a broken record.   [Again](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/i2fok/abusive_user/). 

So, anyway.  Things are only getting worse.   And tools were promised that have never materialized.   

I really think the local shadow ban ability needs to truly be implemented in Reddit.  Not everyone uses Automod, and while it can do that, it does break down from time to time.  This is a feature that needs to be built into Reddit.   There have also been other tools previously promised.   

So, Admin folk.... Update us please.

In a perfect world we would be able to promote correct answers (verified by panelists) to the top comment, along with flair. I would seriously pay for this ability, plus the ability to lock a post so no one could comment once it has gotten to the ""circlejerk"" point, which has been happening in increasing frequency lately. Just yesterday I removed a huge amount of circlejerky comments that kept coming in after the question had been answered very thoroughly. If we were able to lock a post, it would save us an incredible amount of work, especially on controversial questions.

***
This is just a re-hash of some of the points I, and others, made in the /r/changelog thread... the only reason I'm posting it here is because there was no response.

The rational is pretty good:

* @ is almost never used in comments.

* It's easy to parse-out email addresses as they don't have spaces before the @.

* @ is pretty much the universal was of addressing others on most websites. (Even when there is no corresponding feature invoked)

* It makes more sense, mentally.  (*at* agentlame -vs- *approximately* agentlame.)

* ~1880 is an an actual user, but ~1 is not.  Simply disabling the auto-link if a number follows make the feature inconsistent.


The reason I bring it up again is because it is live, and I'd hate to see people become accustom to it, while we can still change it.  Plus, it's confusing as it's implemented currently.  I've already seen ~5 comments using approximate numbers, and only one using it to link to a profile... sure, that's not much, but it's only been a day.

**EDIT**  
To put my money where my mouth is, I forked Snudown, and attempted to implement the changes myself.


Caveats: 

* I have never edited the reddit source code.  

* I have no way to test this.  

* I used GitHub's online editor.  

* I based it off of [this commit](https://github.com/reddit/snudown/commit/3af9b647e7ad25a022561ce6228768b0e97b6737), not the master.

1308077843.0	hzmt1	Unnecessary 108 KB of data transmitted upon every 'save' in the CSS editor	BauerUK	31	6	0	"Maybe this is something that the admins are aware of, and if so I apologise.

It seems that, upon every **save** and **preview**
in the subreddit stylesheet editor, a total of 108 KB of extra data is 
transmitted, along with any stylesheet changes a user makes.

This data comes from text in the 'default stylesheet'
textarea that can be optionally expanded and collapsed in the editor. Something
which is never changed, and serves only as a reference, yet is transmitted 
upon every CSS save.

Since saving the stylesheet to see changes is something I do excessively
while testing a new addition, I've noticed a significant speed increase by
opting to *not* transmit this extra data.

This may not be the most scientific test, but when submitting an empty
stylesheet (with the redundant 'default stylesheet' data included) I noticed
an average wait time (that is, the total time from send until receipt of the 
HTTP response) of around 1.1 seconds.

Without the additional data, the average wait time is about 300 MS and the total
content-length shipped is **212 bytes**.

Supposing, on average, you make 25 saves to a stylesheet while you're
fiddling about with a new feature for you subreddit, or simlpy experimenting,
whilst sending the extra data you're wasting about **27.5 seconds**
per CSS session (or CSSion, if you will).

Without sending that data, the same amount of saves would take only around 
**7.5 seconds**, a save a total of about **20 seconds per CSSion**.

Maybe it's an over-estimation, but I reckon I can easily rack up 200 edits of
the stylesheet when setting up a stylesheet initially for a new subreddit, or
adding a particularly complicated design feature.

Since the overhead is roughly 108 KB, that is a total transfer of about 
**20 MB**, and a wait time of around 3.5 minutes.

As I understand that the admins have a lot to deal with, I don't expect this
small issue to be addressed soon. I have therefore written [a GreaseMonkey 
script][script]
which will prevent the additional 108 KB from being sent upon saving a stylesheet.

Note: I apologise if my assertions are incorrect due to bad math(s) and/or science
and I invite criticism and cross-checking of the above claims.

# **TL;DR**

Subreddit CSS editor sends additional 108 KB of additional data for no reason.

Look, I know this will seem like a small issue - but the notion that ""reddit needs more servers!"" comes up constantly from people's posts complaining about a slow/buggy day on Reddit and this screen only encourages more of it.

Invariably someone links to Jedberg's post about how more servers isn't really what Reddit needs...

At the end of the day, seeing an image like this just perpetuates that complaint/request, and it'd be pretty easy to just say:

""Buy an ad. It'll pay for a new developer to help keep Reddit up longer"" or something to that effect...

LeDucky	30	3	23	"So the trouble is my posts sometimes end up getting caught in the spam filter. The usual thing to do is to message the moderators and they can unblock the posts. But as you know the moderators are busy and it takes some time, which is understandable.  
  
However the problem is that once the posts are unblocked they are usually already a couple of hours old and when you post to a more popular reddit these old posts get buried under a ton of new posts in the new queue, so they don't even get noticed.  
  
So the idea is to put this unblocked posts to the top of the new queue, so they might get an equal change as other posts at being noticed. Or if that would require too much work one possibility is to reset the post date, so it looks like it has just been posted and would therefore be automatically added to the top of the new queue.  
  
I think it's a nice idea that would ease some of the frustrations users have with the spam filter and it would put the pressure off the moderators to respond ASAP.

Rhakan	39	11	10	"We've seen time and time again that when Reddit decides to try and solve a crime, identify criminals, or take any kind of action against perceived ""wrong doers"" Reddit ends up causing lots of problems for innocent people.  For example, users caused massive problems [for innocent people](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1co7pt/great_job_on_the_journalism_reddit/) that they believed to be connected to the bombing attacks.

The TOS already forbid posting any personal information, but this often times isn't enough to stop the problem.  A post with personal information will be upvoted to a high position inside the thread and be seen by hundreds or thousands of users before a moderator is able to remove the post.  It takes even longer for an administrator to ban the user from Reddit.

What I propose is simply that any thread that exists for the sole purpose of identifying people, or any thread that is likely to result in a circle-jerk posting and upvoting of personal information, should be deleted entirely.

Furthermore, I also propose that any users found to have upvoted posts containing personal information should be banned.

I thought it would be cool to add domains in a whitelist which basically tells the spam filter to never block links from that domain regardless of content. Example:imgur.com and min.us. 

On the flip side, say if memes aren't allowed in your subreddit, you can ban meme sites such as quickmeme.com and quickme.me. So then the spam filter will automatically block it. This would also be good for fact-only based subreddits to block unreliable sources.

The top comment was some inane joke, as I'm used to by now, but then I noticed the tag next to it: ""Funny"", and the comment below was a ""5 - Insightful"", and it really was insightful, and that got me thinking...
What if a feature was added to reddit whereby you could tag your votes? So you upvote, and can optionally select a reason: ""funny"", ""insightful"", ""thought-provoking"" etc. And when you downvote you could also tag: ""off-topic"", ""offensive/inappropriate"", etc.  
  
Then, as a user you could choose to sort by not just the standard hot/top/best etc ranking algorithms, but also by ""insightful"", ""funny"" etc. The ranking algorithm could sum over the comment tree so that even if the root comment was ""Funny"" but the tree contained a very insightful discussion, the comments would be sorted so you could see them first.  
  
That way, reddit users could continue to look at lolcats and keep the enormous pageviews that pay the bills, but if you want to you could see a view of reddit ranked by insightful comment. Vote-tagging would be opt-in, and have a minor effect on small sub-reddits, but on large sub-reddits or posts with many thousands of comments it could make it a lot easier to sift out the wheat from the chaff.

Basically he was asking if reddit was defined by memes now.

It's become clear that steadily declining quality is a hallmark of most of the default subreddits. I used to think it was an exaggeration to say that reddit is mostly defined by memes, image macros, etc but I don't think so any longer. 

Sure there's still plenty of quality content on reddit, maybe now more than ever. Problem is, to a new or only occasional visitor to the site, they don't see much of the quality. So the new users we bring on will have a much lower expectation of quality than before. Something needs to be done.

I actually raised this issue with Yishan Wong when he did an IAmA but he failed to respond. I'm not sure if this reflects an overall lack of concern among the admins about the quality of content on reddit. If they are willing to do what needs to be done, here are some possible suggestions:

- Allow customizable sets of subreddits to recommend to friends, or have various sets of defaults to choose from.
- Allow new users to pick some general guidelines to base default subreddit selection on.
- Do away with defaults entirely. Just show users /r/all and let them choose their subscriptions individually, like Twitter."	t5_2qqhi	True

Reddit needs more good moderators, and the existing moderators need the option to make our mod logs public if we choose to do so. If I had such an option, all of the crude workarounds I have constructed would be obsolete, and could be closed:

Allow sub-reddit admins to select which reddit they want their postings to feed into.


It'd be nice if /r/gamingnews could feed into /r/gaming for instance. And people would take notice which sub-reddits their stories are being fed in from, proving that posting to a sub-reddit does not hurt your chances of reaching a wider audience.


Another benefit is that we'll be creating a self-organized community, bringing us all closer together and taking the collective conciousness of reddit to the next level :D

**Implementation:**

Lets say /r/gamingnews wants to feed /r/gaming.

* /r/gamingnews admin makes a feed request to /r/gaming
* /r/gaming admin accepts the request.
* All new posts to /r/gamingnews show up in /r/gaming

Posts would show the specific sub-reddit in the details, similar to [r/all](http://www.reddit.com/r/all). Additionally, by feeding a larger sub-reddit you accept that their admins are allowed to help manage your sub-reddit's post content, but not the look and feel of the sub-reddit itself.


**Main benefits:**

* Incentivize posting to sub-reddits.
* Give people hope their niche post can reach a wider audience.
* De-incentivize posting specific content to larger reddits.
* Allow admins across sub-reddits to work and know each other better.
* A community built directory of how all the sub-reddits link together.


**Another example:** 

I dont want to subscribe to 20 music sub-reddits, but I would like to subscribe to just /r/music and have the popular stuff from those sub-reddits feed into it. Currently people don't want to post to the more specific music sub-reddits because they want to reach a larger audience.

---

Hey,

In some slow moving, opinion based or time sensitive subreddits, I think an option to redirect http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit to http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/new/ would be beneficial. As you probably know, browsing to [the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit) will currently show the hot tab. You can manually browse to http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit/hot, so I think it **might** be possible. Maybe there could be an option in the community settings. And then you could include an option in the user preferences to override the mod option.

Thanks,

-Adam

This would be a good option to have, especially for large/default subreddits, so moderators can temporarily remove posters that have violated the subreddit rules but not so egregiously as to warrant a permanent ban. It would be nice if it could keep track of the total number of times a person has been temp banned overall as well as the tracker of temp bans per month.

Personally, I think the temp ban time limit should be between 1 hr and 3-7 days, but leaving the maximum at 1 day should be sufficient for most moderators.

Some have [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/sqyou/add_a_description_box_next_to_usernames_on_the/c4npztx) having a text box for a 'Reason why this person was banned'.

My thought revolves around how great I think multireddits could be. The current system works like this: You create a url that contains two subreddits- TLD (reddit.com) /r/ and then the subreddit names separated by a + sign. [Here's an example of a multireddit I created recently for the Chicago subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago+chicagofood+chicagopics+chicagotrees+chicagobeer+chicagomusicscene+chicagocolleges+colum+depaul+iit+loyolachicago+northwestern+roosevelt+uicwhatshot+uchicago+chicagojobs+chicagoroommates+chicagogameswap+chilist+chicagosupperclub+chibears+hawks+chicagobulls+cubs+whitesox)

Multireddits are great because you get the top submissions from a wide variety of sources- sources of your choosing. You're not confined to a specific topic. If you want a multireddit that has all issues relating to gender rights, you can create one that includes both r/mensrights and r/feminism (that's a hoot!)

And here's the thing- it's my feeling that multireddits can be the future of reddit. They can become as integral to the reddit experience as subreddits are today.

**Here's my idea.**

Imagine that you can create a multi reddit by any name. You decide to create /m/pics. Yes you see that instead of /r/ we're using /m/ for multi. Then in this new sort of page, you have the ability to add multiple subreddits. You become the moderator of this new grouping of subreddits and you can add other mods to the group. Then users can come in and subscribe to your multi-reddit just like they would to a regular subreddit. You can add and remove subreddits at your leisure. Users decide to subscribe to the multi-reddit, not necessarily to every individual subreddit. Perhaps if you were the creator of /m/pics, you would want to include r/pics, r/destructionporn, and r/cityporn among others. Perhaps you would include every pics subreddit that you could find on reddit. The point is that you would have a page that includes far more content than the current subreddit system can support- and you allow users to subscribe to that page like a subreddit without actually subscribing to individual pages of content.

From the subreddit standpoint, we could then include the number of second generation subscribers. Perhaps there are 2000 subscribers to r/destructionporn, but there are 20,000 subscribers to /m/pics which contains r/destructionporn. So a subreddit could have direct subscribers as well as indirect subscribers.

What /m/ would do is open up reddit to even more exposure to the smaller more boutique subreddits without taking away their individuality and specificity. And it would allow new users to quickly jump on board with a lot of really great content by subscribing to just a few multi-reddits.

Allowing an /m/ to be css styled like a /r/ can be would also cause unique new communities to form. /m/ communities would be broader than /r/ communities and the content within /m/'s would evolve based on the subscription direction the moderators take. Suppose that the moderators of a /m/sports multireddit decide to keep it limited to more mainstream sports subreddits. Perhaps they remove the college based sports subreddits and keep it limited to all of the major league subreddits. Perhaps the moderators decide to add all of the NFL, MLB and NBA subreddits. The possibilities are as varied as they are with subreddits.

Another unique thing about /m/ is that it keeps control still at the subreddit level. /m/ mods can only decide which subreddits to subscribe the /m/ to. They can't remove posts like mods of /r/ can. They can't delete comments either. All they can do is create a gathering place for subreddits and style it as such. They could communicate via the side bar and perhaps via submissions to the multi-reddit.

How does this idea sound? A viable next step for reddit?

**TL;DR - Changing the way multi-reddits work could be the next big step in the reddit experience. Allow users to create /m/ multi-reddits that they then moderate and add or remove subreddits from and allow the community to subscribe to multi-reddits.**

When making a self post, have the option to include 'co-submitters'.

They would get a message saying ""soandso wants you to be a co-submitter for [post name]."" You would be able to approve or decline, much like a mod request.

Once you do, it would be shown in the post, and comments made on the post would go to both (or all) of you. When the main submitter comments on it, their name would be in blue and have an [S] like it normally does, but co-submitters would have a [C]. 


Why would this be useful? Think AMAs. Sometimes, there are AMAs from multiple people (ex. Rooster Teeth) and they have to sign off their name at the end of their comment. It would be much easier if they could reply to questions from their own account and have people recognize them as legit.

This screen is not very informative on what is actually happening, and does not tell the user who to contact to find out more information. It is also very confusing to newer members.

My proposal is that instead of the forbidden page have a better explanation as to *why* the reddit is ""forbidden"". [Similar to the banned reddit page, which explains exactly what is happening](http://i.imgur.com/lHRZf.png).

I have made a [quick mockup](http://i.imgur.com/MgLcv.png) by manipulating the page in Chrome inspector. This example shows the moderators of the private subreddit as well as an (optional) description that explains what the subreddit is actually there for.

I propose we allow users to be able to move their submissions to different subreddits, so as to preserve up/downvotes (or at minimum  comments) and help keep things in the appropriate subreddits.

I've been complaining for some time about certain trends on Reddit, and the only thing I can say in my defense is that those complaints seem to be catching on with a lot of other people as the perceived problems get worse. Consider, for example, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jlbdf/2_am_ice_chili_shower/c2d2hcz).

Not so long ago, I made [a modest proposal](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/i84w5/can_we_start_treating_imgurcom_links_as_self_posts/) in /r/ideasfortheadmins, to the effect that points gained by links to the imgur.com domain shouldn't translate into a karma award for the submitter. They should, in other words, be treated like the image equivalent of self.posts. That would, I think, remove an incentive for rehosting, reposting and general karmawhoring that is the unfortunate side-effect of some very good features.

One of the main objections that was voiced in opposition to that idea was that removing karma from Imgur submissions would simply push the abusers to other image hosting sites, like photobucket, min.us, et al. To an extent, I think that's probably true, but no other image hosting site is as trusted or as popular with redditors as Imgur. People serious about not posting images without getting karma in return might well go to another host, but the pay-off would likely be a fraction of what it is with Imgur. We as a community simply have more invested in Imgur, which is perceived as the image-based arm of Reddit. That said, I think there's a way to further reinforce the Reddit-Imgur association.

**In brief:** Make it official. Next to the ""text"" tab on the submission page, add an ""image"" tab. Clicking on that tab changes the submission field to allow the submitter to upload their image directly to Imgur, *from the Reddit interface*.

That would allow the admins to change the policy regarding karma for what are essentially image self.posts, while providing an incentive (increased ease of use) for using Imgur over other hosting sites. At that point, posting an Imgur link would be so easy and intuitive that redditors would have even more reason to wonder why someone would use another hosting site for posting images to Reddit, which would provide a further disincentive for trying to work around the anti-karma-whoring tactic.

I know about [mobile reddit](http://m.reddit.com). As far as I can tell, it's pretty much the regular reddit website but it uses a different CSS stylesheet. Wouldn't it be possible to implement a similar sfw.reddit.com that uses a CSS stylesheet to take out all the NSFW content?

I don't know much about web programming, but it seems like it should be an easy venture. I use m.reddit.com every day (both for my phone and as it is, by its nature, an SFW version of reddit), and I would definitely utilize a sfw.reddit.com.

EDIT: Just checked, apparently there is an SFW subreddit, but that's not what I meant. :P. I'm sure eminent domain could overtake it, or you could use safe.reddit.com or something.

It seems like, in the same way you can add .mobile to the end of a link for the mobile version, .rss for the RSS, you could have .sfw or .safe for the SFW version. rss.reddit.com and m.reddit.com also function in this way.

EDIT2: User BitRex was actually constructive and helped me put together a greasemonkey script that is easily toggled on and off that can be used to make reddit completely SFW:

    var l = document.getElementsByClassName('over18');

        l[0].parentNode.removeChild(l[0])

But we've been running into problems: all the parks and facilities we've contacted are totally booked on June 15th, and some of the ones we want to apply to have high application fees that could have been lower if we had applied weeks beforehand. It doesn't help that in our particular case we also have to find a venue that can accomodate up to 600 or more people.

In other words, if we had 2 months (or longer) instead of 1 month to find venues with an exact date to tell them, it'd be much easier to plan this event. Just an idea, one that would be greatly appreciated next year!

**Trophies**

This post is prompted by blackstar9000's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/w0s00/using_flair_to_cultivate_chivalry/) in ToR (flair for new queue watchers). But we already have the Bellwether trophy, so ideally mods should be able to assign this trophy per subreddit. In this very subreddit flair is abused to implement trophies (""helpful redditor""), but to generalize, mods should be able to reward users for various kinds of good behavior, like scout merit badges.

**Karma**

Suggested a thousand times here so I'm not going to repeat all the points, but the advantages are obvious. You already track karma by subreddit so this is doable.

**Account age**

Instead replace it with when account was subscribed to a subreddit - much more meaningful for focused subreddits. This also ties in with annual trophies.

It would be nice if I could tweak the filter for merging them (as I see it - I may be totally off on my thought process, of course).  Even something that was just like show no more than x of this subreddit per 50 links.

But basically I just want to be able to reducing 2 sub-redits from taking up 33% of the links...

When you ban a dedicated troll they just create a new sockpuppet and continue on with their trolling...but they wouldn't be able to do that if you could set these thresholds.  Subreddits that have to (for whatever reason) constantly ban people, could be left in relative peace by simply increasing the threshold...filtering out all but the most dedicated trolls and seriously inhibiting the efforts of those who are dedicated (i.e. if they have to wait a week and amass 100 comment karma to just post 1 horrible comment, it wouldn't be worth it for sane people).

Of course this would limit the contributions made by new accounts...but I don't see that being a big deal unless every subreddit chose to institute high thresholds, and I don't see that happening, especially on the larger subreddits which are more likely to attract the legitimate (non-troll) new accounts in the first place."	t5_2qqhi	True

Let me just drop an idea in the mix to illustrate a possible use-case relevant to the recent addition of mod-managed flair. My basic idea is this:

1. Moderators add a special Reddit user account as moderator on their flair-enabled subreddits. Perhaps there is also a special opt-in step.
2. Users of those subreddits use Reddit as an OpenID provider to log into my hypothetical website.

If it takes a while for moderators to get to a submission, let's say in /r/science for example, the joke and junk comments can earn themselves a fair amount of upvotes that push them quite high on the page in the sorting orders. Upon removal these comments can't be downvoted anymore and essentially get locked in their sort, other comments need to displace them in order to push them down which takes more time, and ultimately the lower point comments have a tougher time getting up the page solely because removed comments are higher up.

This idea would put all the removed comments at the very bottom of the sort for best and top but would not harm the karma of the user whose comment was removed.

I don't see a downside and only see it being a positive for the subreddits forced to do heavy vote removal to maintain their rules.

1366066455.0	1cf6pf	[Petition to the Admins of reddit] Organize the mess that is r/worldnews r/news and r/usnews	contraman7	37	15	8	"The Boston Marathon is indeed a tragic event that is still unfolding, however the moderators and the admins of these the various news subreddits are deleting threads with relevant information and stating that people should instead look to other areas for updates on the situation. 

I propose the following:

1) Better define within the subs what deserves to be in what section and to what degree should it be. Many of the mods in r/worldnews are saying that threads about Boston should be in the r/news section and mods in r/news are saying that Boston should be in r/usnews. It needs to be clearer what should go where. Also perhaps allows the moderators the ability, within the news sections only, to move posts to the current sub. Preventing the outcry currently unfolding on r/worldnews.

2) The mods and admins of news related subreddits (like worldnews and news) be able to be elected and or recalled by the community when the community calls concern to their actions.

2) Creation of a subreddit for current or unfolding events. This sub should only deal live updated streams that are read only. This way people can get up to the second information, without the nuttyiness of digging into other areas and risk having mods delete the content. This sub should be moderated by dedicated (perhaps staff of reddit or named users of the community) and treated as a live feed for events, much like a news station.

3) Creation of a grave yard area on subs. So that if a user want to or is willing to enter it they can find deleted threads. This way information might not be lost.

I give the mods of world new news and us news credit for dealing with the mass influx of threads and outcry with a reasonably level headed manner, its just the confusion between where things should go and the lack of power for the mods to move them to the correct area. Also the fact that the guidelines within the different subs mentioned are different from each other.

The admins of reddit really need to take a look at this and clarify, unify, and organize the news related subreddits to make access to current events easier and universal to the whole user base.

That is, either approve it or remove it, depending on whether or not it follows our rules. Not only are our mods expected to keep the modqueue clean and answer modmail, but they are expected to patrol the new queue as well in order to (hopefully) catch rule violations before they become popular.

At the moment, when my modqueue is clear and I've responded to all of my unanswered modmail, I open my new queue and run this Chrome bookmarklet:

     javascript:$('.thing:has(img.approval-checkmark)').hide()

This hides any submission that has already been approved by another moderator, leaving only virgin submissions behind. Then I set to work. The only dilemma is that sometimes entire pages of 100 submissions have already been approved, and I have to keep navigating to the next page and running the script again. The reason I do this is because occasionally there are large time periods where a moderator was not active, and many submissions are unapproved, but these submissions are buried several pages down the new queue.

I was thinking that it would be nice to have some sort of moderator queue like the traditional modqueue, except instead of displaying the contents of the spam filter + reports, it would simply show the global /mod new queue, minus any submissions that have already been actioned by another mod.

TL;DR: I think it would be really cool/helpful if we had another modqueue to grind, one filled with unmoderated submissions from the /new queue."	t5_2qqhi	True

There should be some kind of feature that allows us to ""rank"" our subreddits if we so desire, so that the rank of each submission can be pre-weighted to a certain extent.

I'd be able to handicap /r/funny or /r/pics submissions by 10%, because the top posts get so many upvotes that it's irrelevant. If I then also boost all /r/trees submissions by [10]%, I'd see a lot more of them.

Had these submissions been placed in the proper subreddits, they may not have attracted the same amount of attention. Instead of removing these submissions and having them re-create them in other subreddits, since they have already gained popularity, why not just move them?

The mod of one subreddit should be able to temporarily remove a submission so that it doesn't show up on their front page, while pending to be transfered to another subreddit (awaiting the mod of that subreddit's approval).

If accepted, the submission will be brought to that subreddit with all of the votes it has already received. If it is denied, then (and only then) should the submission be wiped clean of the data.

Whether or not the data should be wiped is another argument, this is simply an idea for a quick fix that might help all of these submissions which make it to the front page before getting deleted for not properly following a specific subreddit's orders.

1287077013.0	dr8sw	Goal: to increase small subreddit traffic so as to increase the quantity and quality of content in growing subreddits. Idea: Subreddit of the Week.	dxcotre	25	3	12	"Specifically, I'm trying to think of good ways to increase subreddit advertising. Often, there are very cool subreddits for different topics that do not get enough traffic. The random button was a good idea to help expose people to random subreddits, but perhaps other subreddits deserve a chance to shine.

A subreddit of the week might help people to look at cool reddits. I'm talking about maybe more obscure reddits that don't often get a lot of traffic.

**How I think it might work:** First, I'd like to suggest that with the ""ALL - RANDOM - FRIENDS - MOD"" bar goes ""SROTW"" (SubReddit Of The Week) or something like that, just so that it is easily visible to everyone. This would link to the one subreddit of that week, potentially increasing it's traffic.

The really tricky part is how to choose the subreddit. I am well aware that you admins are already loaded down with work and can't afford to waste time doing things like this. Therefore, I propose a SROTW subreddit where people submit suggestions and the most upvoted suggestion each week are linked by the SROTW button. This has the added bonus of increasing the quality of the subreddits that are submitted because I feel like only those who actually like this idea would peruse it.

Keeping in mind that the original goal was to increase small subreddit traffic so as to increase the quantity and quality of content in growing subreddits, we will have reached this goal in two ways by this proposal. First, the SROTW button will allow **any** user to just click and find this subreddit, and if they like it they will potentially subscribe and submit content; second, the SROTW subreddit is a good place for those who are not sated by one subreddit a week can browse for quality content subreddits.

My only quip with this plan is with the SROTW button. I feel as though the ALL-RANDOM-FRIENDS-MOD buttons have not been significant features since their release and could use better real estate on the site; i.e., they should be more visible and not just blend in with the list of subreddits.

Once again, the goal is **to increase small subreddit traffic so as to increase the quantity and quality of content in growing subreddits.**

tl;dr: Small subreddits need a better way to increase their numbers so as to truly grow and provide a good quantity of quality content.

I like the Orangered shirt the best because to the layman it is an insignificant orange envelope, but to the consummate Redditor it means everything!

Let's say someone posts an important news article which, while important, isn't exciting per se.  Now, lets say, at the same time, someone posts a BS sensationalist news item.

What happens?  Well, people browsing the new section all click the sensationalist item, and only the few hardcore newsy types click the important news item.

The hardcore news item, after 30 minutes, has 6 upvotes and 0 downvotes, while the sensationalist bs item has 30 upvotes and 15 downvotes.

Ultimately, the hardcore news item dies, and the sensationalist item, while a lot of people downvote it because it is BS, ends up going farther.

-------

There is a simple way to counter balance this effect and get better quality submissions.  Add a new button [either next to ""whats new"" or inside ""whats new""] which is called ""best %""

This will do what is implied, it will show submissions [over the past 24 hrs or whatever] in order of highest percentage.  Obviously [to ignore 1 upvote, 0 downvote situations] you'd set it to ignore anything with less than like 5 votes or something.

This could have any number of prerequisites for use, up to and including having it be a 'request for admins' which would require admin approval for use. Certainly if admins are heavily involved in removing vote brigadiers they too would be aided by this functionality.

A removal of vote capability could be implemented in a shadowban style method, where users appeared to be voting, but didn't count. This leaves all sorts of wonderful implications on the table.

(Reading posts in theoryofreddit and on circlebroke, I know there is content problems in many default subs such as racism in /r/videos, religion bashing in /r/atheism, etc.)

For people that are lurking or have no account, I have no idea if there is a better way to present reddit other then displaying the most active pieces of it.

However, when you sign up for an account, I think there should be some intermediary setup page for your account. Right now when making an account, you are thrust back to the frontpage containing default subs. I propose a page that lets you browse subreddits by category (eg have a video game category that when clicked on brings up /r/games, /r/gaming, /r/gamernews, etc), sorted by users, that allows the new user to see all related subreddits at once. This way they can remove things they have no interest in from the get go and subscribe to subreddits that are more focused with what they want to see.

From experience, i tried to find new subs by googling ""list of subreddits"" when i was a new user, since there was no idiomatic tool for this that I could see on reddit. After some frustration, i gave up. Most of the smaller subs I found were promoted in comment threads, which while lucky for those that see it is an awful way to promote subreddits. I think having a very well organized and sortable page for new users would help lead new users to a better experience on reddit."	t5_2qqhi	True

* How to get a promoted ad? I know there was a blog post a while back how reddit was promoting some subreddits on the sidebar – but I can't find it again and don't know what I have to get in order to qualify

* How to add user flags? Many subreddits have tiny flags and tags after the name of some users: how do I customize them?

Just following /r/Apple would give me access to all the other sub-reddit postings. 

How would it work? Sub-reddit creators would simply ask the mods of a plausible parent whether they could be attached, and feed in. Top-level reddit mods would get to pick which sub-reddits they want to automatically feed in.

Mods of the parent category would be able to mod as normal, but their decisions wouldn't effect the post's status in the sub-reddit. 


Advantages - 

1. You get the creation of niche, specific Reddits, without fragmenting the community.

2. Subreddits become more discoverable

It's all voluntary (subreddits can stay unattached if they like), but you should get a community-built taxonomic topic tree.

I kind of think of it as iGoogle, not the widgets, but the pages you can make to put related materials together. Obviously in this case, it would look exactly like any other reddit page, except just subreddits that you want.

For example, you could put together news + politics + business + worldnews + worldpolitics into a section just to get that fix.

So I propose some type of ""image handicapping"" feature be added that identifies image links and makes it a little harder for that link to rise up.

1350972798.0	11xm6i	A new moderation system, giving top moderators more control over what other moderators can and cannot do.	twentyone_21	38	16	20	"1. I would be happy if there were more hierarchy controls in place. Here would be an example of a large default sub: ""Subreddit Administrator"" decides subreddit policy, promotion of moderators, doing anything that current moderators can do, and would be over some ""Moderators,"" which could do most duties, CSS work, check the modmail and log to see if the lower janitors are doing their job, as well as remove/add the ""Janitors"", whose actions are limited to only remove/spam links/comments, and generally work the /new queue and the modqueue. This allows subreddit administrators to give more control to more people without worry of drastic changes, like the /r/IAmA fiasco not too long ago.

2. If #1 is too rigid and not flexible enough for most subreddits, then let the top moderator place limiters on the lower moderators' abilities to allow each subreddit to set up a structure that best fits their moderation plan. This makes sure that nobody can hijack the CSS or add new moderators without the top moderator's approval.

3. If the subreddit administrator goes inactive, the moderators can remove him with a vote, and vote in a new subreddit administrator. Also, /r/redditrequest submissions would be handed by a button that will allow anybody to take over a subreddit with no moderators.

This was inspired by [this TheoryOfReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/11xji0/distributed_moderation_and_the_future_of_reddit/) that suggests that there be a ratio of 1 moderator to 1000 subscribers for proper moderation.

1341336240.0	vzk0j	A modest proposal: time-weighted voting (time cost per upvote) to suppress the lolcatastrophe	drzowie	25	3	21	"All social media suffer from what I've termed the *lolcatastrophe*: when forum size exceeds a certain limit the forum gets full of shallow stuff (""lolcats"", ""memes"", snark, and the like).  

Everyone here is familiar with that problem.  Current attempts to get around the lolcatastrophe include heavily moderated groups like /r/AskScience and depth-dedicated groups like /r/DepthHub and /r/BestOf (and even /r/TrueReddit, though that has been having lolcatastrophe problems of its own).

Voting media like reddit are great, because they use the customer base themselves (us) to highlight good stuff that others are likely to want.  But, as implemented in [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) or [Digg](http://www.digg.com) or even [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) they don't scale to huge sizes.  How do they fail?

Well, as subreddit/newsfroup/forum size increases, the number of submissions increases.  The initial filtration is akin to walking through a slush pile, a task for which we need to thank the [Knights of New](http://www.reddit.com/r/knightsofnew).  As the subreddit grows, the New tab gets harder to wade through, and rapidly upvotable posts (memes, knee-jerk sensationalist headlines, and lolcats) get a serious advantage.

I propose to knock out the shallow-post advantage with a simple technique: assign upvotes and downvotes based on the elapsed time (with no other Reddit activity) between *retrieval* of a post and *upvote* of the post.  This requires a floating-point (or fixed-point fractional) upvote/downvote score, and all required information is in principle available to either the javascript reddit client or the reddit servers.  Upvoting or downvoting *without* retrieving the linked article should be ignored or weighted very lightly.  

I suggest a logarithmic scale (value of upvote grows logarithmically with time) to raise the cost of cheating (e.g. waiting an hour to drop a downvote bomb), with a smooth rolloff on the small end to whatever the ""didn't download the link"" weight (0.01) should be, and maybe a smooth rolloff to a constant value above something of order 10-20 minutes.  The time scale of the logarithm should be about the same length as the desired article-reading time - something between 1 and 5 minutes.

Time-weighted voting combines two ideas for improving the voting system:  costed voting (it costs time to upvote) and using reading time as a heuristic for the ""depth"" of the post (thereby extracting some further information about post quality from the user's behavior).  It is not perfect, but would suppress the lolcats problem in subreddits with 10^5 or more users, by reducing the effect of kneejerk upvotes.

The vote weighting calculation could be performed in javascript on the user's computer for initial rollout.  This saves effort on the server side, but does open the field to trolls who will try to game the system.  Ultimately, weighting would have to be performed on the server side.

As an added bonus, the logarithmic weighting could have a mod-adjustable time scale per subreddit - so mods could select for uniform weighting, for a very short time scale, or for a very long time scale.

Using a fixed point vote system would not necessarily involve changing the schema of the Reddit database. It could be implemented by multiplying all existing vote scores by (say) 100 and keeping them in the same integer field.  If that is onerous, a new column could be added with the new vote field.

I know that many other subreddits have a similar setup.  When someone makes a new post in our private subreddit, it was customary to PM all other mods to notify them of the post (since they don't garner many upvotes, and are deep on the front page).  Using the modmail is not sufficient, as many mods do not regularly check the modmail, and if the message isn't continually replied to, it will get buried.  The issue now is that our moderator list has grown, and PMing all the fellow mods to notify them of the new submission is tedious and somewhat impractical.

It would be super helpful to have a ""message the moderators"" type button, but put it in the Admin Box.  Typing out a quick, ""Hey check out the new rule proposal in [/r/fu_mods](/r/fu_mods)."" and having it send in PM form to all the mods would be really useful.  That way, it would be guaranteed that all the mods would see it.

1271471909.0	bs3qn	"""Subreddit Recommendations"""		22	2	4	"Only ~396 subreddits out of 10,000 subreddits have over 1,000 subscribers. Currently, the only way for a person to find a specific reddit is to scroll or search in [/reddits](http://www.reddit.com/reddits/). Disregarding the search feature, it is actually quite difficult to find reddits that might be of interest. If a reddit mod/creator wants to advertise the subreddit, they can make a submission to /r/newreddits with only 4000+ subscribers, make submissions in other subreddits, or pay to advertise on Reddit. This method really doesn't do a very good job at reaching Redditors who may be interested. 
      
From advertising in [/r/newreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits) (4000+ subscribers) and other subreddits, about 12 hrs of reddit time, [/r/themepark](http://www.reddit.com/r/themepark) gained 6 subscribers. For the heck of it, paying $20 for advertising on Reddit gained the subreddit 9 subscribers, to a total of 36 readers. 
      
Meanwhile, [/r/birdpics](http://www.reddit.com/r/birdpics) has gained 21 subscribers to 144 readers with no formal advertising. Instead, the good mods at [/r/pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics), who have 250,000+ subscribers, added the subreddit to a link on their sidebar. In exchange, I decided to link [/r/ornithology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ornithology/) as they did the same, and they gained 9 subscribers to 130 in total. 
      
Currently, linking in a reddit sidebar to other reddits of similar interest is the best way, at least for me, for people to discover reddits and increase subscribers. But this would require every subreddit mod willing to do it.
      
It would be great if we could have a recommendation system, similar to how Netflix recommends movies, that would give people recommendations for subreddits to join. I would think that more active subreddits make a more active community.

That would, for one thing, allow moderator discussions to take place in the sub itself, without the overhead involved in creating an entirely separate sub specifically for moderator discussions.

Perhaps more importantly, though, it would allow moderators to attach administrative comments directly to posts and other comments. If, for example, mods suspect that a given submission is spam, but aren't yet sure, they could reply with a mod-level comment saying that it's under review. That would (a) notify other mods that someone is already working on the issue, and (b) allow for a mod-level discussion that is directly connected to the subject of discussion, rather than set off in another sub where other mods might overlook it, but (c) without drawing too much attention or derailing normal conversation in case the post is allowed to stand.

Some other allowances would have to be made for mod-only submissions and comments—they would, for example, need to be appear out of the usual ranking order so that mods don't miss them. I'd also suggest making invisibility a toggle so that mods can turn their own mod-only posts and comments into regular distinguished contributions, effectively making them (and their child replies) visible to regular users.

That is cumbersome, and in the case of a reluctant user, impractical.

It would be most excellent if we could initial a PM to a user but also make it a Modmail so that all the mods can participate in the conversation. It would also look a bit more official, I think.  Perhaps the way to do it would have an optional field when sending modmail to add an extra user in, if you're a mod.

1360956868.0	18lgya	A more sophisticated sorting algorithm for better discussion threads	M_Bus	21	2	16	"I was reading the recently bestof'd thread about the differences between 4chan and Reddit, and the description of voting stuck out to me. In particular, it is a problem that short one-liners, puns, and image macros are easily upvoted because of the minimal effort required to read them, whereas long posts take a long time to bubble up to places close to the top in comment threads because they take a long time to read and evaluate for quality of content. This encourages people to post shitty, mimetic image macros and gifs and start endless threads of puns rather than contributing to a discussion. It's not a problem in dedicated subreddits, but it can be a challenge in some of the larger sub-reddits for sure.

I propose a new sorting algorithm for discussion threads. Each post would receive a ""rank"" that is a function of the length of the post and the number of upvotes and downvotes. So for instance, a 500 word post that receives 100 upvotes might be ranked more highly than a 10 word post that receives 1000 upvotes.

This is a blunt way of discerning between true discussion and one-liners, but it would encourage people to expand on ideas. Challenging someone with a line ""are you sure?"" would be dropped in favor of providing actual evidence to back up your viewpoint. Moreover, long posts of low quality would get downvoted anyway, so you wouldn't have to worry too much about these contending for top spots.

I'm not saying that this would be the only option or that everyone would even use this option, but I can't help but imagine that this could make a big difference for users looking to see more thoughtfully crafted responses.

I also don't know what a good threshold would be - what function would determine the 'ranking' of a post - but I think you would want a nonlinear function with respect to the length of the post - like a [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).

1. I get a reply.

2. What I ask for gets done.

3. Nothing happens.

This system is poor because of lack of feedback in two of the three cases.  I do not know if my report was welcome, or unwelcome.  I don't know if my report was of use those who wish to make the Reddit community better, or if I'm on the verge of getting banned for being a pain in the ass.  I don't know if my report is eye-rollingly stupid or if it has inspired a meeting to discuss a major change in policy.  When something is done, without a resolution, I don't know if it happened because the admins agreed with my report, and I should report more of that, or if the Reddit took action for some other reason.  If I was cynical, which I am not, I might feel that the admins were ignoring my reports in favor of others.

The zero-feedback thing is very difficult for those of us who are trying to make Reddit better via reports.

It would be much better from a user involvement standpoint if requests could be picked out of admin mail and put into a bug tracker of some sort, assigned a number, tracked, and resolved there, in such a way that the whole thing isn't the black hole that it is now.

\int_{something} ^ {something} &lt;Function&gt; &lt;J([ x1, x2, x3, ..., xn])&gt;

instead of ""Take the integral of x**2, (or x^2 like in wolfram alpha and octave and nothing else!) over the interval blah blah blah with respect to blah""

I have heard about how this would be too taxing and overwhelm the servers, but perhaps the solution is to embed a function in the regular forum source that outsources the computation to another server only when the page is loaded. Like a dedicated texvc server: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texvc.

Example.

Steve__Stevens loads a page. The source for one of the comments is.

loadLatex(""\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \omega} dx .... "" )

where loadLatex is some js function that calls the texvc server and returns a png and some unique Equation ID, or whatever you want. The only time it would be called is when comments are opened. Could implement some functionality where it does even have to call the server if it finds the unique Equation ID as a file in the local cache, (a person loaded the page previously).

I am but a novice in website design, but I only see a small fraction of users using it to display math to begin with, and I am skeptical that it would be excessively strenuous on the servers, if implemented properly.

It would be an amazing teaching tool, that is for sure. I am sure that a significant amount of the confusion in /r/askscience and other places stems from people having trouble parsing answers.

1327625290.0	oyeq2	Please don't let users use /r/redditrequest to take over active subreddits without input from the community first.	demeteloaf	26	7	17	"I understand the idea behind [/r/redditrequest](/r/redditrequest).  And it's a good idea in theory.  If a subreddit is abandoned, allowing someone to come in and take over it and try and make it an active subreddit is better than letting it sit there unused.

However, I think it's an issue when someone is able to become the only mod of an already active subreddit with zero input from the subreddit community.  The one that brought this to my attention was the fact that [/r/r4r](/r/r4r) was recently taken over as abandoned, even though it has 11.5k subscribers and averages about 5 or so new posts per hour.  This takeover was done with zero input at all, and the only qualification for becoming the new mod was that the new mod was the first person to notice that the subreddit was technically ""abandoned"" and asked for it.  There have already been major changes to the subreddit by the new mod.  (Such as changing the subreddit to be 18+).

The same thing happened to [/r/xkcd](/r/xkcd) 4 months ago, when it was taken over as abandoned, while it had over 20k subscribers.  One of the first things the new mod did was link [/r/mensrights](/r/mensrights) in the sidebar, which a lot of people were not cool with. (It's since been removed). 

Can we make a cutoff (something like 2k+ subscribers), where if a subreddit of that size is considered abandoned, and someone requests to be a mod, a post on that subreddit should be made notifying users that their subreddit is considered abandoned and they need to have mod nominations or something.

Cause i think it's extremely arbitrary that the metric by which we decide who takes over an abandoned, but nevertheless popular, subreddit is simply which person A) first notices it's abandoned and B) knows that you can request control of abandoned subreddits on [/r/redditrequest](/r/redditrequest).

Couldn't we have a review, send the moderators a message asking if the thing is still active, and if not then just close it/merge it?? Or make a general call to the public to pinpoint all the ones they wish to be closed. Make it once every year, and it should keep things clean.

Also maybe a user-based tag system for each subreddit, to find similar topics. On addition to the moderator recommendations, the user based tag recommendations (the top 7 most tagged subreddits + 3 random tagged subreddits go on the list). This should enable more subreddits to reach critical mass, which will overspill into the creation of more relevant subreddits.

I would advocate against a general automatic recommendation system to avoid crowding on a single elite of subreddits.

The community is getting really big, but there is still a lot of potential to bring more people. But if there is no organisation eventually you'll end up with a million inactive subreddits and only a few active ones from which people don't get out.

I'm willing to chip in time to get this done.

Cheers.

----------------------------

I just read about the [Massively parallel crowd-sourced JavaScript app server cloud](http://www.nonblocking.io/2008/12/massively-parallel-crowd-sourced.html) proof of concept. This proof of concept does distributed computing, much like SETI@home, using Javascript. It occurred to me that we might be able to take this idea and turn it into a revenue stream for Reddit.  

We could call it ""HiveMind"" ;)

**The Idea:**   
The admins could put together a service that sells computing time much like the current self-serve advertising service. Customers could purchase computing time in various units, which us users would then provide.

Users would be able to opt-in and provide idle cycles to Reddit. All the data crunching would be done in the background as you browse Reddit. For the most part, you wouldn't even notice it was happening.

All of the computing time would be donated to Reddit by its users. This would allow Reddit to provide a huge amount of computing time to various customers/organizations with relatively little maintenance cost.

**Requirements:**

1. A robust distributed computing system written in Javascript.
2. Integration of the distributed computing system with Reddit.
3. A customer portal similar to the self-serve advertising portal.
4. An API allowing customers to provide data to be crunched.

**User Experience:**

It is critical that we do not impact the experience of the Reddit user in any way. As such, we need to implement the following:

1. An opt-in/opt-out mechanism for donating your idle cycles to HiveMind.
2. The ability to set the maximum amount of CPU you want used at a time.* It would be best not to saturate the user's CPU
3. The ability to set the maximum amount of ""Units"" you want to donate per &lt;time period&gt;. This could be used to prevent Reddit from skyrocketing your power bill.

*I don't know if this is even possible with Javascript. Hopefully it is.

**Further ideas:**

1. A screensaver or background process that accomplishes the crunching work for when you're not on Reddit.
2. Badges/Rewards/Karma/Gold Membership for donating computing time?

Thoughts? Ideas? Input? 

Edit: Perhaps we could also offer to provide computing time to various free organizations like SETI and FOLDING. We could have checkboxes in the user preferences that allow you to put some of your time toward these types of projects."	t5_2qqhi	True

- Here's my biggest concern: What if I go away for two weeks.  I'll have tons of unread moderator mail.  Which is fine, I suppose, as most of it will be answered by other moderators.  So, I can probably skip reading r/pics and just *hope* they were all answered.  That may not be the case, though.  Furthermore, I would not know if there *were* unanswered moderator messages, especially on the smaller subreddits.  What if there's one where I'm the only moderator?  What if I'd have ten like that?  I'd have to check each one to see if there were unread and thus unanswered moderator messages.  The whole thing seems inefficient at best.  I propose messages that were unanswered by any mod have their own tab (or, less ideally, highlight color).

- The auto-collapsing is weird.  I don't get it.  Read comments should always start collapsed, I think.  And unread should always be uncollapsed.  Seems easiest and most straightforward.

- Pappenheimer has also said that the ""unread"" demarcation seems inconsistent.  It's not always marked as unread even when it is.

- Why do i see old messages from subreddits from before i joined?  I started moderating a new subreddit and I see ""unread"" messages from weeks before I started moderating there.  Well... Obviously I couldn't have read those!

- It would be nice to have a button to start new ""threads"" from within moderator mail rather than having to go to the subreddit.

1265991263.0	b1bdx	Can the reddit icon at the top of the screen behave like Google's?	thelastbaron	27	8	11	"Whenever the reddit logo changes for some special occasion or event, a lot of times I don't recognize what it's supposed to be for. For example, right now, it's a tiny orangered Alien head and an orangered envelope icon. I don't know why. When this happens, my immediate and natural instinct is to click on the icon. Why?

On special occasions and holidays, Google changes their logo on the main search page to celebrate. Clicking on the logo takes you to the search results for that occasion. So if it's President's Day, Google's icon might incorporate references to the President. Click on the icon, and you search for ""president's day"".

So on reddit, I keep expecting clicking that special reddit icon to somehow explain the meaning. 

Here's my idea: make it so that clicking on a special reddit icon (just for reddit's front page, as I know many subreddits have custom icons) takes you to a reddit search result for submissions relating to whatever the icon is celebrating. A few days ago, I noticed the reddit alien celebrating the Saints winning the Super Bowl. In this example, clicking the icon would show me a list of submissions having to do with Super Bowl/Saints news and discussions.

1365939801.0	1cbkxk	Idea for spreading out the influx of new users across multiple subreddits, instead of spiking the default subs	Mr_A	21	2	6	"I originally posted this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1caucj/reddit_growing_in_popularity_whilst_facebook_is/c9ewrne?context=3). I have since refined it and will be adding mock-up images in the time to come, if I can find the time, which I hope I can.

Basically the discussion which prompted this idea focused around Reddit becoming more popular and the quality of the default subreddits taking a hit as more and more users joined the site and had less and less idea of how to function as a part of it. I'd seen that same topic crop up more than once and always the response is to encourage the user to find smaller subreddits. It shouldn't have to come to that. This is the main bulk of what I wrote:

&gt;One suggestion is to have a second step on registration suggesting subreddits you may be interested in. You can choose to ""stick with the defaults"" or ""customise your experience"" right off the bat. The second option will have you put in things you like (Cooking/cars/painting/software/classic films/literature, etc) and it throws up a bunch of subreddits ""Maybe you would like to subscribe to these subreddits:"" and checkboxes next to some subreddits.

&gt;For example, you type in ""cooking"" and it spits out /r/cooking, /r/slowcooking, /r/askculinary, /r/tonightsdinner, /r/52WeeksOfCooking and you click which ones you like.

&gt;These options should be preceded by a sentence or two which is carefully written to say its only an option and will also enchance the experience of using the site, to make it not seem like we're going to target the new user with links to ""interesting articles"" about which toaster they should buy immediately, right now.

&gt;What this will accomplish, I believe, will spread out reddit's new userbase across multiple subreddits, which will a) relieve the load on the default subreddits and b) diversify the new user's experience, meaning that he/she will be exposed to many subreddits at once and their communities which, hopefully will give them a deeper understanding, quicker, of what the reddit experience will tolerate and is about.

&gt;I'm not going to pretend that this will prevent default subs from fluxing in and out of quality sinks every couple of months or so, but I will suggest that it will hopefully cause these fluxes to be less intense and farther inbetween.

I would like to hear feedback, what you guys think about the idea, what you like, how you would see it working and so on. At this point in time I can only see one potential down-side to it and that is it will take registering from being a one-page affair to a two-page affair. Effectively doubling the amount it takes to create a new account. This is superficial and can be addressed. Firstly, make the second step optional. Actually, that's the only thing you need to do. The other thing you need to do, is remind new users that they can branch out. Run internal ads which can suggest this tool to users whose age is less than two months.

Surely this goes against the entire section against downvoting in [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting)? 

&gt;**Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

This'll be quick.

I don't like having to wade through truckloads of inane comments when I'm trying to find or follow a discussion, but I think it's great that others can enjoy a joke and share what they want to.

Here's a quick solution to keep everybody happy.

Place two radio buttons above the comment entry input. One says ""Fun"", the other says ""Serious"".

Fun is always selected by default.

If you want to post something serious, click on Serious, because, let's face it, we're more likely to make the extra half a second effort.

Then at the top of comments add a drop down/link buttons/radio buttons/whatever, allowing readers to select ""All"", ""Fun"" or ""Serious"" to choose which comments are actually returned. Voila, everyone's happy and we can co-exist in peace and harmony.

Reddit has grown, and the larger subreddits now often need many more moderators.

The moderator log was added yesterday, listing each action. If these were given an ""action count"" (1 point per approve, remove, mod-mail reply etc), moderators could be assigned a numerical score.

I think it would be a fairer system to sort them by activity, and it would incentivise moderators to do their job, improving Reddit as a whole.

I'm a mod over on [/r/gamedeals](/r/gamedeals) and our spam filter is more or less completely broken. We get a decent amount of posts, but excluding a few outliers, most of the submissions are from less than 10 different domains.

When we have to remove a submission, we are forced to remove it as spam. But most of the time it is not. Most of the time we remove a submission because it has an incorrect affiliate link or something similar. And that leads to problems like me waking up to find 6 perfectly fine amazon posts in the spam filter.

I think this could also help with multiple submissions of the same deals. We get reports pretty often when 2 of the same deals are posted, but we don't like to remove the posts because they train the spam filter. Instead, we gently ask the most recent submitter if he wouldn't mind deleting his submission.

Thanks,

-Adam"	t5_2qqhi	True

Could we have some sorting options on subreddit search results? For example, could they be sorted on ""popular"" (number of subscribers) by default?

[This was mentioned three years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/9ink4/x_liked_it_is_awkward_for_some_titles/), yet we still have the words 'like' and 'dislike' popping up all over reddit. For instance, you can check out all the things you have upvoted by going to www.reddit.com/user/USERNAME/liked. 

The usage of 'like' and 'dislike' is confusing for new users and helps cement people into thinking that downvotes are for things users do not like or agree with. 

Reddiquette states the following about voting;

&gt;If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

**Controversial**

By sorting by the feature you see posts or comments that have been upvoted and downvoted heavily. The usage of the word ""controversial"" enforces that the content displayed will be opinions that are in heated debate. How can upvotes and downvotes alone be used to display such information if they are meant to be used for content that does or does not add to the discussion. These mixed messages further the confusion for new and old users alike.

***

Please make these small subtle changes to help prevent people downvoting things they do not agree with. These changes could help stop reddit from becoming an echo chamber that deters people from posting their own honest opinions.

1324510443.0	nlvq6	Countdown timer for the PROTECT IP Act	Anon_is_a_Meme	26	7	3	"Can I suggest you put a countdown timer up for the PROTECT IP Act?

The PROTECT IP Act is the Senate equivalent of SOPA. It was introduced in May. It passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, and was only stopped from going to a vote because Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on it. SOPA was introduced in October as an attempt to introduce the same ""anti-piracy"" legislation via the House. It has of course met with high profile opposition, so the supporters of this draconian legislation have turned their attention back to the PROTECT IP Act.

[Senator Harry Reid is seeking a cloture to override Senator Wyden's hold](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111217/22470217117/senator-harry-reid-moves-to-approve-protect-ip-begin-censoring-internet.shtml). **They will vote at 2:15pm on Tuesday, January 24, 2012.** The supporters already have 40 senators. They have a month in which to convince another 20 to vote yes. If this happens, the act will be sent to the House to vote on (there it only needs a majority).

That means we (the people) have a month in which to lobby Senators to oppose the bill. We're up against giant corporations, and I think it will require as many Redditors as possible to take part. That's why I think it would be a good idea to have a permanent countdown timer displayed in the sidebar of every Reddit page. [Here is a list of those representative/corporations supporting/opposing the PROTECT IP Act](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/money). I suggest you put that on the countdown timer, so that people can identify who they should contact.

Remember, if the PROTECT IP Act is passed, SOPA won't even be needed any more. SOPA is thankfully getting a lot of attention, but the danger is that it's distracting people from the PROTECT IP Act, which has already passed further through congress. 

I realize a permanent feature on every page for the next month is a big deal, but if the PROTECT IP Act passes the Senate, the probability of Reddit even existing in a few months time will be very low.

One problem is that 99% of all community policing is done by moderators, who are doing a truly thankless job.  The most positive outcome you can have for moderating a subreddit well is a bunch of PMs saying ""thanks.""  The most negative outcome you can have for moderating a subreddit poorly is [having your grandparents harassed by internet vigilantes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7tew/fine_here_saydrah_ama_it_couldnt_get_much_worse/)  At least, that's so far.  For those of you who missed it, in the past three days we've had:

1) [An anonymous kidney donor ask for donations to a charity](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/en681/my_story_as_an_anonymous_kidney_donor_and_my_plea)

2) [A random idiot on the internet call them out for reasons that remain unclear](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/end1m/do_not_donate_to_the_kidney_person_it_is_fake)

3) [A moderator taking the post down](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/end1m/do_not_donate_to_the_kidney_person_it_is_fake/c19fk0f)

4) [The anonymous kidney donor putting up a thousand pictures of his guts](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/enffi/redeeming_myself_i_am_a_kidney_donor_i_always/) to prove that yes, he actually did donate a kidney, and holy fuck what's your problem with giving to charity anyway?

5) The mob that had so recently been demanding the head of the kidney donor suddenly [demanding the head of the mod that did their bidding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/end1m/do_not_donate_to_the_kidney_person_it_is_fake/c19fk0f)

In effect, moderating the big subreddits has become a lot like putting on a yellow armband, wandering into the grandstands of a British football match and then asking people to behave because you're wearing a yellow armband.  The only reason to do it is because somebody has to do it, and the only reason not to do it is because there's about a million and one reasons not to do it.

I think there's a big misconception about what mods do and what powers they have.  I don't think that will change easily.  However, I do think that having a reminder that mods do good and are valuable to the community will go a long way towards incentivizing the job and, perhaps, cooling the jets of the rabble that mostly wants a head on a pike, they don't care which one.

By my count, Reddit currently awards [32 different trophies.](http://www.reddit.com/help/awards)  These simple, cost-free trinkets have, in my opinion, become a big motivator in Reddit behavior and also provide a great deal of community.  Yet we don't do anything to acknowledge our Moderators.  And frankly, moderating a 100,000-person internet community should be at *least* as recognized as ""[contributing a photo to the sidebar.](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/10/fun-in-sidebar.html)""

###WHAT IF:

Every subreddit has a list of moderators.  Suppose we bump the names in that box over 20 pixels, and put one big up/down arrow in there.  You click the up arrow, it turns orange.  You click the down arrow, it turns blue.  They stay that way for a month.  At the end of a month, every redditor whose name is next to that arrow gets the total number of points (up or down) **divided by the number of subscribers in that subreddit.**^1  And on blog.reddit or /r/announcements, the admins announce the top 20 or so moderators for the month, and give out trophies to the top...5?  10?  1?  

Dunno.  But having your work as a moderator recognized would probably be more impressive to the holder of the trophy and more useful in building community than those infernal ""well-rounded"" trophies.  Having a monthly reminder that this entire website runs largely on community self-policing would go a long way, I think, towards curbing the tendencies of redditors to demand perfection from mods while rewarding them with jack squat.  For that matter, a list of subreddits moderated by the winners would serve as handy advertising for the subreddits that are being moderated well... and if the community shifted from poorly-moderated subreddits to well-moderated subreddits, the whole community would run smoother.

Thoughts?

-------------------------------

For example, if I wanted to find the top voted pictures of hypnotoad in /r/pics, this is what I'd have to go through:

* Type 'hypnotoad' into the search bar in /r/pics. Press Enter.

* * Search 1 compete.

* Check box for ""limit search to /r/pics"" then switch ""sorted by"" to ""top""

* * Search 2 automatically takes place once the ""sorted by"" is changed. ""limit search to /r/pics"" becomes unchecked.

* Recheck box for ""limit search to /r/pics"". Press Enter.

* * Search 3 complete. I finally get what I wanted.

-------------------------------

At the very least, when the ""sort by"" is changed, it should see if the ""limit search to /r/"" is checked."	t5_2qqhi	True
