1362197853.0	19i8yk	All My Real Niggaz Holla!	tripledge	269	59	52	"As some of you know, I'm strongly considering turning our token black friend, Tyrone, into his own animated series. Staying true to his comic origins, I plan on keeping him as primarily the silent protagonist, with perhaps a few spoken lines here and there to go along with his character's eponymous catchphrase. It will be revealed in the first or second episode that he has an IQ of 52, which is why, unlike most blacks, he doesn't talk much. Since I can't see making a cartoon a few minutes long with a single character that basically says only one line, I will be introducing two new main characters: a radical liberal, vehemently anti-racist hipster couple who befriend Tyrone, and essentially fill the empty space by speaking for him, while justifying his every bungling, barbaric action on the basis of ""white privilege."" Think of it like *Portlandia* meets *The Boondocks*, only much more flagrantly offensive to both hipsters and blacks. 

There's a lot of this that's still up in the air, so I don't want to get everyone too hyped up. For right now, I have a favor to ask everyone in this sub. If you have a microphone, I want you to record yourself on [Vocaroo](http://vocaroo.com/) as the voice of Tyrone, then post it here. This is more for satisfying my own curiosity at the moment, but I would also like to scout the field for a potential voice actor. How do you hear it when he says SHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIITT?

I personally hear him saying it with a deep, gravelly black voice, [something like Louis Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfeKUNDDYs). I still need to buy a working mic, but even if I had one to record myself, I simply can't strain my vocal cords enough to sound like that. 

But that's just me. I'm a fairly open-minded person, so there's no need to pander to my ideas on this. I want to hear your own interpretation of Tyrone. Feel free to throw in some unintelligible Ebonics while you're at it. Go on a rant about not getting your welfare check from ""da gubmint,"" or how ""whitey"" is keeping you down. Have fun with it, but be sure to end with SHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIITT!"	t5_2u79t	True

To keep everyone appraised, I've decided to post regular updates on here from now on, which will also allow me to publicly answer any questions you have. Let me start by saying I'm very pleased at how much interest this project has generated, and I want to thank everyone who has helped out in whatever way they could. There is, however, one person who deserves a special mention here, and that's /u/GreatWhiteRape, who will be lending his vocal talents as the voice of Tyrone:

http://vocaroo.com/i/s1N8Ia9vOK4s

There aren't many white men who can convincingly sound that black, so give this nigga his props. [Now that you've been properly acquainted](http://i.imgur.com/LXpwd.png), let's cover a few other things:

* The script for the first episode is finished, which means I can now begin recording the voices. It was my first time writing a script for anything, so it took longer than expected, but I'm satisfied with it, and I think you will be too. A special thanks to /u/JBro74 here for lending his advice as a former professional animator.

* The animation program I'm using is Anime Studio Pro 9. Since I know many of you are excited to see what I can do with this thing, I will be releasing a short animation before the first episode of the actual show. Nothing too epic, just a little something to show everyone what the show itself is going to look like.

* I'm thinking about hosting the cartoons on my own website, but I don't know where to start. I'm basically looking for a host that won't remove my content for including songs because of copyrighted material, or because it's ""hate speech"" that could be offensive to ""protected groups"" (which probably rules out YouTube, since that's a line of shit they're famous for).  A host that protects my identity would be preferential as well, just in case the dickheads behind the RIAA decide they want to sue me for copyright infringement. I also want something that will help me make money, so that maybe, just maybe... I can become a professional animator, which would be fulfilling a lifelong dream of mine. If anybody knows of such a package, let me know.

* I've had a number of people suggest I make a Kickstarter to help fund the project, but I'm a little reluctant to take anyone's money at this point. I've been practicing a lot lately with the animation program, and it seems fairly straightforward, but there's always a possibility I could be overestimating my own ability. Then again, I figure if the cartoon doesn't work out, I'll just stick to what I know and turn it into a comic book. You can rest assured this idea will be going somewhere! I'll have something on the website setup for accepting donations once it's up and running, but what service should I use for this?

That's pretty much it for now. There's a few things I won't discuss at the moment, since I don't want to give away too many of the surprises, but you can otherwise consider this an AMA (or an AMAA, I suppose). And before anyone asks, **I promise, no matter what, to still contribute to the sub with comics.**"	t5_2u79t	True

As you may know, I've been outspoken in the past against the commercialization of Internet memes by large corporations. They not only have an uncanny knack for ruining them, but it's just another way for big business to trample over the little guy by stealing his idea. While I highly doubt any corporation would try introducing a ""racist"" meme to the mainstream market, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps I owe it to myself to set up shop before someone else does. Being a small business owner, the harsh economic clime has forced me to the brink of bankruptcy. An additional source of income, even if it's just $20 here or there, would be like the bailout people of my status don't get from the government. It would also give me the satisfaction of knowing I'm bitch slapping political correctness with a sort of postmodern Jim Crow, and to my way of thinking, what better person to backhand the establishment than the one who started it all?

I already registered on CafePress and have the address for my online shop, but thought I would tread the waters here first before plunging right into shamelessly peddling my wares. I figure I can start out with t-shirts and apparel, while gradually working my way up to other items. Not all of these items would be limited to just having the face on them; for instance, how about [a pair of boxers like this](http://i.imgur.com/yeVt1.png)?

So what does everyone think? Would you like to see Tyrone get his own fashion line? Would you actually buy something from me?

PS: Don't think I'm trying to move on to bigger, better things by doing this either. No matter what, I still plan on being an active contributor to this sub. "	t5_2u79t	True

Though I plan on adding a lot more stuff as time goes on, I feel what I have now is a good enough start. Unfortunately, there won't be any [Tyrone boxers](http://i.imgur.com/yeVt1.png), since the customization interface is simply too limited. The good news is, you can still buy a [Tyrone blanket](http://i.imgur.com/1e3jJ.png).

Be sure to message me if you have any problems with your items, or if you want to make a special request for something not in the inventory. I'm always open to new ideas.

Enjoy!

**EDIT: So it would appear coffee mugs are out of the question, since they only allow you to make them for yourself. I also had three declined orders on the drinking glasses, since CafePress flagged these items for promoting ""hardcore drug use."" I fail to see how ""Malt Liquor"" and ""Grape Drank"" are hardcore drugs, but I'm currently trying to negotiate with the CafePress staff in hopes they'll change their stance.** "	t5_2u79t	True
