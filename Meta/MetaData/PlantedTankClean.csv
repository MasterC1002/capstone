1366916771.0	1d3ngf	To all the new folks interested in a planted aquarium: PLEASE read this	goots	138	12	74	"So a picture over at /r/pics (and posted here) brought a huge spike of new user traffic. Awesome! Aren't some of these tanks beautiful?! Now you see how addictive this hobby can get.

Before diving headlong into this hobby, do your due diligence and read up about what it takes to be a responsible fish owner. Learn about the cycling process, and how aquatic plants contribute to the artificial ecosystem you plan on creating. Learn about the relationship between CO2, lighting, and fertilization. Ask questions here. Browse plantedtank.net. I honestly spent about a year reading before starting my first 55g tank, because I didn't want to kill any more fish after learning the hard way.

The FAQ is currently in progress and has been for a while. That's my fault. However, you can find a lot of information in the top nav bar, especially under the **Beginners** tab and the Low Tech Planted Aquarium Guide under **Helpful Guides**. The golden ratio also will explain some good design concepts when creating a new aquascape. To see some ""making-of"" videos, check out the Green Machine videos under the **Inspiration** tab.

Good luck and we're very glad to finally have you in our clutches."	t5_2szbf	True

Just to say thank you for being so supportive.		104	12	21	"So some of you guys on r/plantedtank have followed my progress with my tank over the last several months. And my roommate captured this picture of me, without me knowing, while still in the early stages of plant growth. I suffer from severe anxiety and have been on different kinds of medication my entire life because of it. A family friend recommended that I try aquascaping since it could help relief anxiety problems and can help clear my mind. Since starting with the hobby I have been able to get off of all anxiety meds and have started to grow more confident with myself. Just wanted to say sometimes a simple hobby can be life changing.

1356066993.0	157n3q	If I could go back in time and give myself a few pointers...	Cadillakakak	53	8	35	"Here's a short list of some of the advice I needed when I started up.

1. Try Walstad.

I started out with gravel and root tabs. Big mistake. Even if you're 
a high tech guy who has all the money in the world, 
just try Walstad. Find a cheap or free tank on Craigslist, pitch out the 
$4 or $5 for Miracle Grow Organic Potting soil, and find something
cheap to cap it with (any old gravel, fluorite, EC or whatever you have
laying around). 

Walstad tanks are great for aquascapes or if you just
want a tank to multiply your plants. Use a window or just leave it outside
during the spring and summer for light. Just give it a shot. It's so cheap, 
if it fails, it fails, who cares?

2. Prep your soil. 

When I first found r/plantedtank I had a friendly back and forth 
with a guy about prepping your soil before scaping a Walstad tank. I
insisted that it doesn't matter, you don't lose too much height and the
dirt doesn't really come up when you tear a few plants up. At the time
I was convinced prepping your soil was a waste of time because I had 
a [completely FLAT 'scape](http://imgur.com/prvQv) with a heavy gravel soil cap layer. The gravel 
was larger than pea sized so even when I yanked plants out my tank didn't 
ever have a dirty look. That's the big pro to using gravel as a cap in a 
Walstad (although plants multiply much slower than in fluorite or EC). 

I wish I knew the redditor I was disagreeing with just so I could tell him
he's right. Since then I've tried a scape with EC over an MGOPS hill. It failed. 
I now have a tank with [water logged bark over EC over a flat layer of unprepped 
MGOPS.](http://imgur.com/NLIoy)

To prep your soil you need to sift all the large pieces of bark and anything that might
float out of your soil. Once it's a fine dirt you need to soak it and drain it a few times
to get any loose ammonia and nitrogen out of it and to compact it down so it 
doesn't settle as much once you put your cap on. Remember, the MGOPS hills of today 
are the disappointing flat scapes of tomorrow. Build your retainer walls, soak/drain
your soil, and scape smart! Getting the excess nutrients out before you scape will cut 
down on early algae blooms and mandatory water changes. 

3. Experiment and DIY to save money.

Build your own [CO2 diffusor](http://imgur.com/AqRQd) with a powerhead and a jar, try Black Diamond Blasting sand as a soil capper,
mix your own fertilizers, try lighting a tank with [only a window](http://imgur.com/yAKUp), take plants from the 
[pond by your house](http://imgur.com/yXox7). Don't spend 10X as much on premade ferts because you don't understand
N,P, and K. You never know unless you try. Try and succeed and do a write up!
Try and fail and do a write up! Just try!

4. Know your plants before you 'scape.

Don't plant that cute little 2"" sword at the front of your 10 gallon. Don't buy $20 worth
of HC and rely on root tabs and the promise from the Petco employee that the single strip 
T8 that comes with your tank will do the job. Don't bury the rhizomes of your Java Ferns or 
Anubias. I planted Ludwigia Ovalis in the front of my first tank because I liked the ""small pink
plants for contrast"". It took about a month for me to realize I was a dummy and move them and my Giant Hygro to the [back corners](http://imgur.com/Lqqw1). 

5. Know your fish and inverts.

Do you really want loaches in your heavily planted tank? Can you keep Blue Pearl Shrimp with
Cherry Shrimp? Do your juvenile Rainbows need a nursery tank or can they just dive right in 
with your full grown Boesmanis? Will those Silver Dollars eat my plants? Will those 5 Ramshorns 
multiply into a colony of bazillions?

Save yourself the money, the frustrating trying to catch a fish (my loaches dug up my HC and it all died),
the brown shrimp (cherries breed with Sakuras, blue pearls, greens, etc), the dead Rainbows (RIP $80 worth
of 1/2"" Turquoise Rainbows), the Ramshorn snail colony (turned into my Assassin Snail breeding tank). 

This isn't even close to all the advice I needed or all the mistakes I've made, but it's a decent start 
for tonight."	t5_2szbf	True

The small details are still being ironed out, but we should have something up on the sidebar by this weekend.

This supplier has been vetted by us, and I'm confident that it will be a worthwhile partnership. Please do not hesitate to let us know if there happen to be any problems with the company.

Just so you know, the mods are not bringing in any revenue or any individual monetary gain from this agreement. That's not exactly allowed on reddit, anyways. 

Because we have enough relevant user traffic, we can now convince fellow suppliers to help us out, and benefit as a group.

I scooped him out and put him in the toilet to send him to the great fish tank in the sky. I looked at him one last time before flushing him, when suddenly, I saw him gulp! I plucked him out of the toiled and put him in my other tank. It was then, that I looked closer at the rest of the fish, and sure enough, most of them were still just barely alive. I had no idea what was happening until I noticed my drop checker was bright yellow. I immediately changed 2 big buckets of water and shut off the co2. By the time I got home from work, everyone was happy again, minus one small angelfish who didn't make it. It is a miracle that I made the last minute decision to stop by my house before work. If I had got there an hour later, I think this would have been much more tragic. 

Anyway, I did some research, and it turns out that some regulators become unstable when the tank pressure gets low and can dump large amounts of co2 in the tank causing a fishie holocaust. I am looking into a blow off valve to add to my rig to make sure this never happens again. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they were all a little brain damaged as well, but I dont mind a tank full of happy retard fish."	t5_2szbf	True

ANSWERS	goots	35	6	20	"***Tom Barr, founder of the [Barr Report](http://www.barrreport.com) and inventor of the Estimative Index (EI) dosing method, has been kind enough to answer a number of our questions submitted in [this thread](http://redd.it/14k6or) a few days ago. Here they are!***

---
* What's the best or first piece of advice you would (or do) give to new planted aquarium keepers?

**I'd ask a question before anything, what's their goal?
Cannot start to help someone without knowing where they wish to go. 
Many ways to skin a cattail.**

* What is your favourite substrate? Does EI dosing work with liquid ferts, such as the Easy Life range?

**In the USA, Easy life is not marketed, but many in the EU use it.
Seems like a decent brand name line. Similar to SeaChem in the USA perhaps.**

**Yes, it works with EI, but EI is best used with dIY dry ferts or DIY liquids, the point is to save $ and you will save a LOT of $ if you switch to DIY powders. Dosing calculators making dosing dry very very easy.**

**In the old days you had to know some Chemistry and math, or someone that would do it for you.**

**I prefer ADA aqua soil amazonia as a sediment, easy to use, does not make as much mess as soil, no mixing with other  products that end up making a mess and looking tacky.**

**Soil, ADA is also EI(eg non limiting, at least for a few months for N and then for the other nutrients perhaps 5-10 years) for the root zone, good to have both locations supplied, this gives you the least worry about adding enough Ferts.**

* Is it really absolutely necessary to replace filter biomedia like Ehiem's Efisubstrat in a heavily planted tank? Can the biomedia ""pores"" really get clogged and remove the ability for a nitrifying bacterium to establish itself within a colony? The way I see it, when Eheim claims that ""Ehfisubstrat Pro can be rinsed out and reused several times"", they're referring to starting over with a completely new tank and old media...right? There's so much conflicting misinformation out there about this. Smells like marketing spiel to me.

**Smells like manure, looks like it, likely is.**

**I think you might consider cleaning filters more often, but that's about all. You cannot over do the filtration really, more is generally better.**

**They can clog and start to denitrify, and also all that organic matter drains the O2 supply for things like bacteria that oxidize waste and fish respiration etc. A cleaner tank tends to be a happier tank.**

**Old media used in a ""new"" tank is always preferred and done by many folks. I've done this and used sponge filter ""squeezings"", that brown dusty mulm to seed new tanks. I add it to the filters and to the bottom of the tank and then add the sediment over that.**

* If you were speaking to someone new to planted tanks, would you teach them how to adjust their water parameters to keep the flora and fauna they want to keep, or advise them to learn the parameters of their tapwater and try keeping flora and fauna that will thrive in that environment without chemical additives?

**It's a closed system really, so chemicals like fertilizers, CO2 etc, they will need to be used. Fish food are chemicals as well. I think you mean more like bacteria starters, snake oils, miracle in a bottle to eliminate the need for water changes etc? Stay away from all that stuff.**

**A good link on water filter snake oils:**

**http://www.chem1.com/CQ/wonkywater.html**

**As far as tap water, well, when in Rome, eat pizza, I just live with whatever my tap water has. Generally this works well, in harder tap waters, you cannot keep a few species of plants, and some fish perhaps, but you can keep most.**

**RO can be a hassle, but if you keep more than 1 aquarium, then you can keep a smaller soft water tank and then use tap for the rest.**

**That said, you can spend some more effort and avoid so many water changes and use RO, etc.**

**More work and higher % failure rate however.**

* What is your favorite aquatic plant, and why is it your favorite?

**The new one I do not have.**

* What is the one item or piece of equipment you won't set up a tank without, besides water?

**High quality lighting.**

* Does Seachem Excel work well in general and do you think it's effective to fight algae outbreaks?

**Yes, very effective for many people. Yes, it does 2 things, grows plants(most important) and kills or retards BBA algae. 
Not effective for green algae once established.**

* How do you go about starting an aquascape? The plans I make for my tanks always end up looking completely different to the finished product and I feel like a lot of this is due to limitations in available products: be it plants, rocks or driftwood. Do you get an idea in your head and then agonize over finding just the right pieces for hardscape, or do you let an image form after buying/finding pieces?

**Well, depends on what stage you are at. I tend to see a rock or wood piece and than design around that, hopefully finding the right sized aquarium to fit it in.**

**An exceptional piece, I'll know within less than 1 second if it's a good piece.**

**Stages of the aquascaper:**

**http://www.barrreport.com/showthread.php/35-The-12-stages-of-the-aquatic-aquascaper**

**Most let a lot of the idea form as the scape grows in. Depends on the stage of growth also and trimming etc.**

* Is there any particular 'style' of planted tank that you gravitate towards? What draws you to this style? Which of your tanks has proven the most difficult to maintain and why?

**I've always like plant species. So I tend to have a dutch style background, since when I started, there was no Nature style. I like all styles.**

**Dutch style requires more work and labor IME than Nature style. But some Nature style tanks need a lot of work also.**

* How do you decide what to plant in your tanks? How do you choose which plants go together and what goes where?

**I have moved and tried many different species and have a good idea what goes well together.**

**Sometimes is just whatever I happen to have a lot of, sometimes for aesthetics, or because it's ""new"".**

**Sometimes because I can easily sell the plant cuttings for a profit, a nice looking scape that's also a farm.**

**Gotta pay for the hobby somehow, and it motivates me to trim and keep up on the tank, only took me 35 years to learn how to stop losing $ on aquariums and make some $ :-)**

* What keeps your water so crystal clear? What kind of filtration do you use and how do you fine-tune your EI dosing for each tank?

**Good plant health mostly. In natural systems, dense plant beds clarify the water.**

**I use Wet/dry filters on everyone of my tanks and client's tanks. I seal the dry section with duct tape etc, so the CO2 does not degas. Simple modification but you still get excellent O2 ppm's, about 1-2 ppm higher than canister filters on 6 tanks that I measured over 24 hour periods.**

**That is a lot of O2 actually since the difference between 6 ppm and 7 or 8 ppm is quite large to fish/bacteria etc. So I have less issues adding more CO2, since fish respiration is both CO2 and O2.**

**Surface scum is not an issue or junk inside the tank nor water marks due to evaporation.**

* What is your ideal form of lighting and why? Have you ever used LEDs?

**The sun and shade cloth actually. I use ATI dimmer computer fixtures with T5 lighting right now. I can program the light to go from 0% up to say 75% over 2 hours very smoothly. Gives a nice even transition. CO2 also comes on and raises over a similar path, so the light and CO2 match up well.**

**Not cheap, but less than LED's and better spread of lighting. I use LEDs on reefs. Some of the small A&amp;H supply and Finnex LED's seem to work well. I have not used them, but the PAR and spread seems good.**

**I've tried DIY Crees on planted tanks, I was not impressed, but things will change and get better with time.**

* On an average week, what does your maintenance regimen entail?

**About 2 hours or so.**

**Water changes are done on 440 Gal worth of tank in 4 aquariums right now.**

**While the water drains and fills, I trim and clean.**

**Goes quick.**

* How do you learn proper fert dosing? Anytime I begin to start dosing again I notice increased algae growth so I've more or less given up. I can't figure out what I should continue with and what I should cut back on. I'm using the Pfertz line.

**Ferts are maybe 5% of issues with algae, most of the issue: light and mostly CO2.**

**I added non limiting ferts to rule out that. Then I move on to CO2 and slowly add more and more and watch very closely.**

**I do not add more and then say, wander off to work for 9 hours. Then come home to dead fish.**

**90-95% of algae issues are due to poor CO2 management.**

* Have you met Mr. Amano? Who are some active aquascapers who you admire/draw inspiration from? What's your favorite schooling fish?

**I've met him a couple of times.**

**David Chow(CAU), the Long(Vietnam) and the Dutch side: John Frenken, Willem van Wezel and his son Fred.
A few others, there are many.**

**Cardinal tetras.**

* Wet/dry, sump, or canister filter for a planted tank?

**See above.**

* Finally, would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses, or 1 horse-sized duck?

**100 duck sized horses. It would be like soccer practice.**

**A horse sized duck would be a problem.**

1360166060.0	1804si	'A Brief History of Time' or 'How I Learned How to Run a Planted Tank' 	jacob_ns	34	5	16	"*A Brief History of Time*

Last spring I decided I wanted an aquarium again as in the past I've had several, the most recent being a 90g Cichlid tank, so I talked to the accountant (my wife) and set out and picked up a used 33g tank and stand for sale locally. 

I knew I wanted to eventually go high tech planted but was limited financially so I chose **not** to buy a pressurized CO2 setup which I would eventually come to regret. I bought a 36"" Hagen GLO T5HOx2 canopy and other equipment and began prepping. I read quite a bit about the type of substrate to use and after much research I settled on potting soil capped with sand/gravel. I wasn't able to locally source Flourite so I ended up using thoroughly washed playsand from a local hardware store. 

I began putting it all together and went to the LFS and picked up about 10 bunches of Amazon Sword and a giant ball of (free) Java Moss for the tank. Admittedly I knew nothing about actual plant husbandry or maintenance and was literally just doing things that seemed right. 

After the cycle completed I added 10 Tiger Barbs, 4 Corydoras and 3 SAE's. For the first couple of months, things were relatively okay. I knew I had too much light but kept the photoperiod short and other than that, I didn't do anything significant to the tank other than regular cleaning. Here's where I got very, very stupid. Algae (short hair algae) started to build up on the glass but with regular cleaning I could keep it off the front and sides and I began to think it looked **good** on the glass in the back because it added texture so I let it be. [And then it started to spread. To everything.](http://i.imgur.com/Cru55.jpg) I knew I had a very significant problem that was unsolvable with the equipment I had. 
[The tank was physically very healthy but the plants were unable to grow due to the algae and it looked like shit.](http://i.imgur.com/vj8tm.jpg)

*How I Learned How to Run a Planted Tank*

Cue research period number two. I learned about CO2, EI dosing, water parameter balancing and C2O2 dosing. [I found an already build CO2 setup locally](http://i.imgur.com/vTb7S.jpg) and picked it up for a great price which included ferts and a box of Flourite. Now I had all the required equipment I needed and had to figure out how to utilize it all.

First I had to remove as much algae as I could. I went from [this](http://i.imgur.com/vj8tm.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/CSZwF.jpg). I pulled a tonne of leaves off the Swords and hoped thet introduction of CO2 and fertilizer would be enough for the plants to outcompete the algae but there were still many leaves covered with algae. I was wrong. The algae persisted so I started reading about the [One-Two Punch Whole Tank Algae Treatment](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showthread.php?t=203684) and went for it. I dosed the tank with a high concentration of H202 for about 15 minutes, all the while changing the direction of my filter output. Immediately I could see effects so the dosing and within two days the algae was dying off. I cut my swords back to nearly nothing, trimmed my Ludwigia down to 3"" and waited. Most of my snails died, as expected. Fortunately, they're impossible to eradicate completely and now they're making a triumphant return. 

It's been about a month since the treatment and as the following photos will attest, all is well. I can't stop the plants, there's no algae at all excluding a bit of BBA which the snails and SAE's enjoy and the plants begin pearling shortly after the lights come on. 

Anyway, sorry for the textbook but I figured there's something in here that others can potentially learn from so there you have it.

I inherited a 10 gallon tank from a friend who upgraded and decided to make it a planted tank after I started doing some research.  I've made a couple of posts here (where everyone was very helpful) but still haven't actually come up with a plan that I'm happy with.

Here's the deal:  I live in Canada in a place with no LFS, I need to order *everything* online.  For that reason, I plan to plant my tank and then put shrimp in it.  I'm OK with that, I think shrimp are pretty cool and since my tank is so small I would never be able to add any fish that really interest me anyway.

The problem is, with no local resources I'm afraid that I'm going to invest $100 in a nice light/filter, plus another $100 (shipping is crazy expensive on the sites that I found) for plants just to watch everything die.

So here we are.  What I want to know is this: Can anyone give me a ""fool proof"" starter setup for someone in my position that won't break the budget?  I know that with plants there is no way anyone can say ""this will work 100%"", but I just need a plan that is going to give me the best chances of being successful.  I want to start with just plants and then add the shrimp down the road (in a few months after things grow in).

My only requirement is that I want to have a nice lush looking carpet, some taller green grasses/plants, and maybe 1-2 reddish/purplish plants to add a pop of colour.  I'm still not sure about CO2 since I can't get anything filled locally, so I'd be stuck ordering those (rather expensive) small disposable cartridges online (the only thing in my budget is that small Fluval system).  I'm not averse to DIY with yeast/sugar, but since I'm so new I don't know if I'd actually be able to pull that off and I don't want to risk messing things up.  If I can do without CO2 that would be great, but I really don't know if that's OK at this point.

So yeah, tips, tricks, advice, guides, *anything*, would be appreciated.  Thanks!"	t5_2szbf	True
1372909026.0	1hm2al	Craigslist Score	OligarchyAmbulance	30	3	18	"I just needed to tell somebody what happened today, because I'm so excited about it.

So I saw a Craigslist post of someone selling a 35 gallon tank for $35. It was rimless, came with a light, filters, etc. The low price made me assume something must be wrong with it, but I figured I could at least check it out. Upon seeing it, I discovered it belonged to this woman's deceased family member and she just wanted to get rid of it. That price! 

I got it home and the more I stared it at, the more I wondered how many gallons it was for sure. It just looked too big. I decided to measure it, and do some magical math conversions. Actual size: 42 gallons! Needless to say, I'm in heaven right now.

TL;DR: 42 gallon tank for $35

We all perform tank maintenance. Sometimes, perfectly good plants end up in the trash, because they simply outgrow their limited environment. Why not share these plants with another hobbyist? This monthly thread offers a space where buyers and sellers can congregate, promote biodiversity, and make the world better.

We've decided to pair this thread with the monthly [Aquascape contest thread](http://redd.it/1binj9), with the hopes that with all the pruning you are doing to make your tanks ready for submission (you are submitting your tank, right?), you have some extra plants that could use a second lease on life.

**The Rules:**

1.Sellers, prices are encouraged to be as low as possible. These are plants you were willing to throw out, after all, so remember to [HABO](http://i.imgur.com/DZmJ0.png). Buyers, you will be responsible in covering the cost of shipping, at least. If a buyer is happy with the sale, please consider offering the seller more for their time spent packing and shipping.

2.The transaction details should be conducted via PM as reasonably as possible.

3.Please use a third-party payment organization like Paypal to conduct transactions, if it can't be done in person.

4.Always be wary of online scams. /r/PlantedTanks, the mods, and Reddit hold no responsibility for your private transactions. You are liable. By participating in this thread, you agree to this.

5.***DO NOT POST PERSONAL INFO.***

6.Use the usual WTB/WTS (willing to buy/willing to sell) acronyms at the beginning of your posts, along with the name of the plants.

7.Sellers are welcome to use creativity and fun when offering their stuff. Pick a number, favourite colour, most unusual story, ugliest face contest ([but be aware I will win](http://i.imgur.com/RQC0D.png)), etc.

**Shipping Instructions:**

Please review [this thread](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showthread.php?t=71992) for some insight on how to properly ship plants.

Please [let the mods know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPlantedTank) if you have any suggestions to make this better!

---

**The Rules**

1. Images must be hosted by imgur

2. The subject of your photo must be an aquarium

3. A user will not be eligible to win the contest more than once every six months, or 180 days

4. Photos can be old or recent, but must be of the submitter's personally owned tank. If this comes into question by the users or the mods, proof will need to be provided (like a picture of your tank with a ""hi /r/plantedtank! 8/24/12"" sign)

5. The winner will be determined by total number of upvotes. Downvotes will not be considered.

6. Submissions must be made by 2400 Pacific Standard Time (0100 CST, 0300 EST) on February 28, 2013.  The voting thread will be posted on March 1, and the winner will be announced on March 7.

7. Submissions will only be accepted via this thread.  Comments not containing picture submissions will be deleted so it’s easier for the mods to compile the voting thread.

8. You must include a photo “title” with your picture link.  This is due to the format of the voting thread; user names will not be included to encourage voting upon merit and not who the photo or tank belongs to.  It doesn't have to be anything super creative either, simply ""55g planted"" will be fine.  We just need text to link back to your picture.

**Remember**

1. You MAY submit an album of photos, but it needs to be limited to 3 pictures

2. As a community, you have decided to judge on auquascape ONLY; please use your discretion

3. Videos will not be permitted this round, but how the contest is run is still being discussed; let us know what you think [here](http://redd.it/zohtn)!

**The Prizes**

- One month of Reddit Gold, provided by the mods

- The winning picture will be featured on that month's submit button at the top of the page!

- Your Reddit user name at the top of the sidebar, in all its glitzy glory, with a link to your picture, your profile, or your tank journal (your choice)

- A special background color for your user flair text so it stands out a little more!

- Clean the glass!  Use rubbing alcohol and a clean, cotton cloth for best results.  For even better results, don't use a cloth that has fabric softener on it.  Added by nova 624000: Vinegar can be helpful if you have water spots. A razor blade will also remove dried water spots from glass.

- Get on the level with your tank.  Photos angled down or up, or sometimes even to the side, can be confusing to the eye.  When viewing a 2D picture, it's a little harder to visually distinguish angles without lighting and spacial cues.

- Added by purebishop: Use a polarizing filter and a wide open, fast lens and a high ISO if you have a DLSR camera.

- Frame the whole tank in the picture (without using the zoom first).  Don't be so far away that we can see furniture and the like around it, but not so close that we can't see the outer edges.

- Play with the flash.  Depending on the angle of your camera to the tank, it may or may not be beneficial to use it.  Generally, the more straight-on you are to the tank (the tank and camera lens are parallel to each other), the less lens flare you'll get.  Added by effieokay: If you use flash, put the camera right up against the glass. Otherwise you're just going to get a pic of the illuminated sheet of glass and nothing beyond it.

- Almost always, unless you're taking photos of bioluminescence, it's better to take a picture with your aquarium light on, but with the room darkened.  Taking photos at night might help.

- If your camera has an underwater setting, is may not always be helpful.  Generally, this just mutes the blue hues.  In an enclosed planted tank, what you're going to mostly have is green hues.  Muting the blue hues (using the underwater setting) might make your tank look yellowed.

- If you're trying to take pictures of fish specifically, use your highest shutter setting to capture movement (speed over aperture setting).  If you're trying to take a super clear picture of your scape, use aperture over speed.

I bought all my wedding supplies from this website, and they are wonderful.  They have a lot of wood items (manzanita branches, ghostwood, driftwood, cholla) for really good prices.

I was just looking at an aquatic supplier, and they wanted $55 for a small piece of driftwood.  You can get 9 pounds of it from this website for $39.  I've seen cholla pieces go for $8-10 for a 6"" piece.  This site sells a 12-18"" formation for $16.

In addition, they have other items that can be used for aquascaping as well.

Obviously, these items will need to be soaked or boiled, and some of them aren't suitable for aquatic use with fauna, so do your research. :) Grapewood, for instance, is safe for aquarium use but it won't last as long as a hardwood item."	t5_2szbf	True

**I thought it might catch a few more eyes if I were able to distinguish it and let you know this is being seriously considered.**

Almost every time a planted tank is pruned or re-scaped, unwanted-but-otherwise-perfectly-fine plants get thrown into the garbage. These plants could help another hobbyist who is just starting, or add diversity to an older, established tank.

We're thinking of starting a monthly ""Random Acts of Kindness"" thread offered as a companion to the Photo Contest thread, where users can post plants that they want to get rid of for the low price of shipping. Via Paypal, or something similar.

It would strictly be ROAK-only. No outside links, advertisements, or auctions. Once a month. Any WTS/WTB (willing to sell/willing to buy) threads will be first directed to /r/aquaswap, and then moderated accordingly. We do not want to turn this into a WTB/WTS subreddit, and it will be a little more tightly moderated depending on how it goes.

This is my attempt at a Spike Moss carpet. I used ""brown plastic canvas"" as they call it for a base to set the moss (It's like a plastic grid). I used Frag glue is small amounts to secure the Spike Moss to the canvas. It has a little growing to do but im pretty proud of it. These pictures are roughly a week in.
Any suggestions what to attach to the drift wood in the back left corrner? It has small red swords on it right now, but I'd like to do Glosso *(thanks goots)* or something similar. Alas i have a hard time finding any bottom growing plants where i live let alone Glosso.

So a while ago, I was talking here about how I couldn't find any mini fissidens. I think it was right after that APC article with the guy who used a sausage grinder to grind up fiss and lay it on rocks in a dry start to get it to grow. This was like at least 2 months ago. 

Well, a week ago I get a message asking ""weren't you looking for mini fissidens,"" from myth1n. I said yeah and he asked for my address. Box just showed up and [contained this!](http://i.imgur.com/5YwpP.jpg)

What a dudebro! Not only was there the fiss, but a great portion of mini pelia, Myth1n's World Famous UG, some frogbit (I think?), ludwigia sp red and some other assorted goodies. For someone still pretty new to this hobby, I *thoroughly* appreciated this, and it lets me try out some species that I had never thought to try. This is *exactly* like the bombs going on over in r/cigars, and I couldn't be happier to see this kind of stuff in our wonderful subreddit here. Only problem I have now is I need to find a place for all this stuff, but that's not too bad of a problem, right?

So myth1n, thanks a ton! You're a total GGG. I promise to stop pestering you about flooding that tank of yours now. ;)

This morning, there was an unexpected small snail in my tank. I assume it hitched aboard the plant, but I was nonetheless prepared. I picked up the last of the assassin snails at my LFS last week to prevent any invading snails from getting a footing in my tank, so I hadn't seen him in action yet. I figured the small intruder would make a good snack.

I plucked the snails and put them in a jar so I could see it all go down. My assassin snail, he's just a little guy, and he just kind of circled around the jar for a minute. But then he honed in and started feasting - it was awesome. I'm now fully confident in his abilities to protect my aquarium.

Started out with a 15 gallon column tank, but we decided to go larger, so here we are.

I used Miracle Gro Organic Choice and put it in the tank as a 1 inch layer. Let it sit out for over a week. Then on planting day we covered it with a 1 inch layer of all natural black gravel. Set up all the decorations, then filled with water.

It was really cloudy for a few days, but the water was close to neutral and had no nitrites or nitrates, so we added the fish. The cloudiness must have been the soil, because now the water is completely clear, and the parameters are still good. I know it's not the coolest looking tank in the world, but it's still mesmerizing to look at in person."	t5_2szbf	True

1358803015.0	170fi2	PSA: Don't overfill your CO2 tank. Please learn from my stupidity	benjaminchodroff	22	1	21	"This may seem obvious, but don't ever ask to have your co2 tank overfilled. I have a 20oz paintball setup that I get refilled about once a month at the local big box sporting good store. I had the brilliant idea, ""wow, this tank only gets 850psi when filled - it could easily hold more!"" and told the guy filling the tanks to put a bit extra in. He replied, ""hey, no problem - I'll hook you up. Of course, if it bursts, don't blame me."" Seemed like a fair deal. I expected a ""bit extra."" What I got was a bit more than I wanted. When I left the shop, I commented ""wow, this thing is heavy! and cold!"" I think he mentioned he had filled it to 27 ounces. I went out to the car (about 30 degrees outside) and placed the tank behind the drivers seat. 

I filled it while on a trip 2 hours from my home with my girlfriend. I made it all the way home, parked the car, pulled the key out of the ignition and then BAM. It went off like a gunshot and the whole car was filled with CO2. Chaos ensued and we jumped out of the car. After about a minute the explosion stopped and I opened up the back door. The carpet was covered with a nice layer of dry ice and I decided - ""time to go to bed."" Needless to say my girlfriend and I did not have steady nerves for the rest of the night!

It turns out paintball tanks have a ""burst disc"" or sometimes called a ""rupture  disk"". They are a special crafted piece of copper over top of a small hole which is designed to break so your tank does not (think flying pieces of shrapnel like a bomb). Each is rated to match the tank - mine was a 3000 psi rated, which means the pressure exceeded at least 3x what I normally get! 

Please learn from my stupidity. Pressurized gas is !@#$ serious stuff. Don't ever ask to overfill your tank. Make sure your tank is stored some place safe while driving. I was VERY lucky to have been parked when this happened. The trunk is a good location, but you probably don't want to keep it there in the hot sun.

We all perform tank maintenance. Sometimes, perfectly good plants end up in the trash, because they simply outgrow their limited environment. Why not share these plants with another hobbyist? This monthly thread offers a space where buyers and sellers can congregate, promote biodiversity, and make the world better.

**The Rules:**

1. Sellers, prices are encouraged to be as low as possible. These are plants you were willing to throw out, after all, so remember to [HABO](http://i.imgur.com/DZmJ0.png). Buyers, you will be responsible in covering the cost of shipping, at least. If a buyer is happy with the sale, please consider offering the seller more for their time spent packing and shipping.
2. The transaction details should be conducted via PM as reasonably as possible.
3. Please use a third-party payment organization like Paypal to conduct transactions, if it can't be done in person. This ensures the security of the buyer.
4. Always be wary of online scams. /r/PlantedTank, the mods, and Reddit hold no responsibility for your private transactions. You are liable. By participating in this thread, you agree to this.
5. ***DO NOT POST ANY PERSONAL INFO.*** Posting even your own personal info will result in a warning, and then a ban.
6. Use the usual WTB/WTS (willing to buy/willing to sell) acronyms at the beginning of your posts, along with the name of the plants.
7. Sellers are welcome to use creativity and fun when offering their stuff. Pick a number, favourite colour, most unusual story, ugliest face contest ([but be aware I will win](http://i.imgur.com/RQC0D.png)), etc.
8. Don't forget about /r/AquaSwap! Feel free to cross post between their sub and ours to maximize your advertizing power.

**Shipping Instructions:**

Please review [this thread](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showthread.php?t=71992) for some insight on how to properly ship plants.

PLEASE NOTE: **We're doing something new this month. In the past, the mods have been giving out reddit gold to the winners of each contest. This month, we have sponsors and better prizes! However, this will require you to submit differently than before, not using imgur! There will be FOUR ANNOUNCED WINNERS. Please read the instructions below carefully.**

I say again **FOUR WINNERS**

---

/r/PlantedTank is teaming up with [MarineDepot.com](http://www.marinedepot.com/freshwater_planted_aquariums.html) &amp; [Aquarist.me](http://aquarist.me/) for this month's planted tank photo contest. Get those cameras out, take an amazing shot, and you could win a **$25 gift card from Marine Depot**!

The Prize: A $25 gift card from MarineDepot.com - 4 available (MarineDepot.com [ships internationally](http://www.marinedepot.com/help_md_ordering_information_order.aspx#intl), btw)

The Rules:

* Take an awesome photo!

* Create an [Aquarist.me](http://aquarist.me/) account and submit your aquarium picture there. Once you have created an aquarium and submitted the picture, post the permalink (instructions below) into this voting thread.

Instructions:

1. Register with [Aquarist.me](http://aquarist.me/)
2. Create an aquarium and upload the photo to your aquarium
3. There is a permalink button on the bottom right of each photo when you zoom into it.
4. Copy the photo's permalink.
5. Post the link to the /r/PlantedTank submission thread with an appropriate title!

Voting:

The top 4 of the highest upvoted photos in r/PlantedTank that are hosted on aquarist.me will be winners!

**BONUS FOR ALL r/PlantedTank REDDITORS:  If you want to create a photo memory of your aquarium, favorite fish, etc., [Mpix.com](http://www.mpix.com/) is offering free USPS shipping on orders over $15. The promo code is AQUARIST513.** (I'm probably going to use this for the [old man photo](http://i.imgur.com/4Io8Oej.jpg) submitted earlier this week)

If you need assistance in getting entered in the contest contact the /r/PlantedTank mods or the folks over at aquarist.me at feedback@aquarist.me.

---
As in previous months, some of the old rules still apply, with some corrections:

1. Past contest winners may enter, but must submit a new aquarium entirely than the one they previously won with. After much discussion, we believe this is the most fair for everyone involved.

2. The subject of your photo must be an aquarium

4. Photos can be old or recent, but must be of the submitter's personally owned tank. If this comes into question by the users or the mods, proof will need to be provided (like a picture of your tank with a ""hi /r/plantedtank! 8/24/12"" sign)

5. The winner will be determined by total number of upvotes. Downvotes will not be considered.

6. Submissions must be made by 12:00pm EST on Saturday, May 4, 2013.  The voting thread will be posted the same day around 3:00pm EST, and the winner will be announced on Tuesday, May 7.

7. Submissions will only be accepted via this thread.  Comments not containing picture submissions will be deleted so it’s easier for the mods to compile the voting thread.

8. You must include a photo ""title"" with your picture link.  This is due to the format of the voting thread; user names will not be included to encourage voting upon merit and not who the photo or tank belongs to.  It doesn't have to be anything super creative either, simply ""55g planted"" will be fine.  We just need text to link back to your picture.

**Remember**, as a community, you have decided to judge on aquascape ONLY; please use your discretion.

**Additional Prizes**

- The highest voted picture will be featured on that month's submit button at the top of the page!

- Your Reddit user name at the top of the sidebar, in all its glitzy glory, with a link to your picture, your profile, or your tank journal (your choice) at aquarist.me

- A special background color for your user flair text so it stands out a little more!

For those of you who have a large anubias nana plant and it's getting a bit unwieldy, cut off all the leaves (down to the rhizome) except for the ones at the end, and trim the roots. Slice straight down into the rhizome every few inches or so, but not all the way through -- less than halfway. Secure the trimmed rhizome to a piece of wood/broken ceramic/plant weight/rock, and eventually you will notice buds coming out of the areas where you made your cuts.

If your rhizome is too long and you want to split it, cut it straight down the center and ensure that there are leaves on each."	t5_2szbf	True

Despite the fact that it's linked on the sub's front page, the thread only shows up on their/your respective front pages once a month when the thread is posted.  They would like more exposure for the thread.

The issue is, this subreddit does not exist for the purpose of trading items or plants (this is what /r/aquaswap is for).  We started the RAOK thread as a way for users to connect with each other for this purpose in a structured way that would not flood the sub with ""WTS/WTB"" postings, and to keep the majority of content on track with the main purpose of the subreddit: helping others, discussion, and showing off your goods.

I would like to invite those who have expressed concerns, and anyone else who may have an idea, to propose a solution.

My own thought was to change the RAOK thread to a weekly item, instead of a monthly item; perhaps posted every Sunday.  I'm not sure if this would meet the need of the users, however, and this would only be feasible if /u/deimorz can setup /u/automoderator to make the post automatically.  Moderating a sub is a lot more work than one might imagine, and ensuring a specific post is made weekly is somewhat more than we can personally handle at this time.

In short, I’m trying to come up with a solution that makes you, the user, happy; but also is a feasible request upon the moderators.

Constructive discussion is very much encouraged in this thread.  In the end, this place exists and is as great as it is because of the users.  We very much want to ensure your involvement in this sub is useful and pleasurable."	t5_2szbf	True

I'm doing a bit of research on what fish ""school the best"", and I found out that if you put a predator in the tank, the fish ""school tighter"".

It makes a ton of sense, I just didn't think about it.

Do you guys know of other things to trigger natural behaviors in the creatures?

Basically, with the limited size of our tanks, we can't set up all of the different types of environments a fish would find in nature (landscape, lighting, water temperature, predators, plants, foods, etc.).

I spoke with a friend who has been doing aquariums for a long time, and he said to get goldfish to mate, you lower the temperature to a certain range, then bump it back up a bit.

Has anyone experimented with changing the temperature of the tanks over the course of the seasons, to emulate the water temperature of the natural habitat?

Tom Barr, *planted tank extraordinaire*, has agreed to do a bit of an interview with us concerning our hobby. I've offered to collect a bunch of questions from you all and send them to him.

**Please use this thread to ask any questions you may have.**

From Tom's website, [The Barr Report](http://www.barrreport.com/):

&gt;*Who is Tom Barr and what is the Barr Report?* 

&gt;Tom has maintained planted aquariums as a business for more than 10 years and has kept planted aquariums as a focus since 1989. First encounter with aquatic plants in 1977. Tom started his college education till after he was already keeping fully planted tanks. He has spoken at many societies and meetings over the years on aquatic plants, both marine and freshwater on a wide range of topics and has designed various devices to help aquarists.

&gt;Tom has done substantial lake management during 5 years and continues to work on many projects for larger Koi ponds, fungi control, lakes, wetland creation and also environmental consulting as a business. 

&gt;Tom presently is a graduate student at UC Davis, California: testing of herbicides on aquatic invasive weeds and using bottom barriers to control aquatic weeds where chemicals cannot be used. Tom taught Biology the same Community College Classroom he once sat as a student.

&gt;Tom writes for this web site and is the author and proponent of the Estimative Index aquatic plant fertilizing method. 

&gt;Tom seeks understanding on the basic questions surrounding plant growth and control. His research addresses both herbicidal and non herbicidal methods as alternatives and using new approaches to solve aquatic weed control issues. These include both microphytes (algae generally), macrophytes (Plants and seaweeds) and fresh- and saltwater environments.

&gt;He has discussed many topics over the years on the web and in person with many people interested in plants and is involved with a number of local societies and a member of SFBAAPS in San Francisco, CA, the oldest and perhaps largest aquatic plant hobbyist group in the USA.

&gt;Various of Tom’s articles have been published in numerous languages around the world and can also be found in Weed science journals, TFH, FAMA, TAG, AP and RA, AP and GGA."	t5_2szbf	True

A family friend of my gf's gave me 4 Pink Convicts around 6-8 months ago and when I asked him if a 10G would suffice he said yes (I had never owned any fish other than a goldfish so my knowledge of aquariums was probably a 1/10) even though he has been keeping tanks himself for many years (a couple of tanks &gt;50G). Long story short(ened), I house them in a 10G, find out about this sub months later, am filled with shame upon researching them, and buck up and bought a 20G Long to ""upgrade"" them (its all I could afford, poorish college kid lol). They've been doing well in the 20G since December now but it's still not an ideal home for these fish. I would prefer to see these guys go to someone with the tank size/means to give them the life they deserve because I won't be able to afford 50G+ in the foreseeable future.

I believe I have 3 males and a single female (she has orange markings and is smaller). The three males (bigger fish) are around 3-3.5"" and the smallest (which I assumed is female) is probably around 2.5"". [Here]( http://imgur.com/JlgEY) is a picture of one of them (more upon request). Water changes about 30% weekly and fed 3 meals a day. I would love to hang onto these little guys but I would not sleep well knowing I didn't try to find them a suitable home first. *Anyone in the Springfield, MO area want them?* Also know they are **FREE**, and I will NOT let anyone take them that does not have a more appropriate tank size for them

My nitrate and nitrite levels are low, the water's pretty hard, and the pH is at about 7.3, so it's more or less neutral.  
Basically the problem I've been having is my plants are getting covered in algae, turning brown, and dying as you can see in the pictures. A few of my wisterias have already died, and the mystery plant in the back left has almost fully died. Is it a problem with my lighting? Or maybe a lack of CO2? I only have a betta and three ghost shimp in there.  
I tried to go for a java moss carpet, but yea it looks bad now. I'm probably going to use [this technique](http://www.aquamoss.net/How%20to%20create%20a%20moss%20wall/How%20to%20create%20a%20moss%20wall.htm) to spread it around evenly but I was planning on waiting until I figured out what the problem with the tank was before I did it.   
Any help would be appreciated.

Where do y'all begin? I'm starting my tank this weekend and am about to go hunt down some supplies but first thing is first, where do y'all start?

I have a 40 gallon regular over the tank filter but I read that canisters are better, is this true? Or can I get a strong plant grow light, nice substrate and fluorite and plants and get going? I'll be making a home-made D.I.Y. CO^2 generator in a bit. No fish for now, I want to get nice and stabilized.

So, my question to y'all is where do I begin? Is it best to get EVERYTHING at once (which is a little impossible due to budget) and then put it together or piece it together a little at a time?

What do y'all recommend?


Thanks in advance!

**EDIT** Forgot to add Tank Specs: 29 gallon tall (and I'll be re-doing my 20 gallon regular tank soon)

**EDIT 2** here we go!!! Did two bags of Flouramax complete. I went with Java fern, water onion, moss balls, red lilly pads, moneywort and baby tears. Got a large Malaysian wood piece and some rocks I found outside and boiled. A little cloudy but starting to look great! I just have an over the back filter (carbon) and I added an air pump because I thought it would help. I got a 24W plant light planning on getting LED (once I get the dough) another plan is a DIY CO2 later on. 

Any advice further would be great!

I'm out all day so I'm not fussed about the lights being on.  

I have recently put the lights and CO2 on a timer so they come on from 6-10am and then again at 5-10pm, everything seems to be going well, fish are breeding, everything is growing, are there any downsides to this lighting schedule for the fish/plants or will they be quite happy working on a much shorter day?

They still get some light during the day but it's just the ambient light and I have noticed on my days off that they do definitely slow down during that period. I thought about putting the lights on for longer on my days off if I'm home and watching the tank but I'm not sure if that change to the routine would be more stressful. 

Any thoughts much appreciated! "	t5_2szbf	True

I moved out of state a couple years ago and gave my big tank away. But after I moved one of my new neighbors one day was throwing away a nearly brand new 55G. I couldn't resist so I took it and planned to start over again. Then life happened, got married, got a new job, bought a house, had a baby, and had very little time for the hobby. Recently things finally settled down enough so I bought a few things and the following is the result.  

[New Tank!](http://imgur.com/a/XZoTA)  
  
I ammonia cycled the tank for 60 days and just this past weekend I pulled the trigger on some plants. Might go today to buy a few shrimps/fishes. I have one poor guppy in there now (my canary in the coal mine as it were). I don't really like guppies but I feel that I owe him something for his service.

I know sites like APC, plantedtank and local societies have their own gallery/journal forums, but /r/plantedtank is different because, a) we're not a forum with the ability to always update a continuously changing thread, and b) we're a lot smaller of a community, and I would say more family like.

I'm sure many of you join me every sunday taking care of water changes and trimming. Some of you low tech people might not, but that's OK, I'm sure you still enjoy your little bit of nature anyway. What I'm going to start doing is taking a picture of whatever tank I worked on (I only have two, so that will be easy), and posting it. I might say something about a problem I'm having and ask for help, I might bitch about a platy, I might ask for suggestions on placement. 

And I especially hope you do to. 

I think we've got a good group here with some real talent and some great knowledge/information. Let's pool it (huur durr). Hell, let's show off what we're proud of because we're all in it together and everyone else that listens to you talk about green dust algae starts nodding off whenever you get past the first sentence. 

I think this could be cool, and I hope that we can all contribute. So this Sunday, make sure you take a picture and post it in the journal thread, OK?

Last Sunday I was using my [Aqueon water changer](http://www.amazon.com/Aqueon-Aquarium-Water-Changer-Hose/dp/B0054SLKQG/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338591734&amp;sr=8-12) to, well, change the water in my tanks. I overtightened the part that screws into the faucet, called, as I have since learned, the Water Flow Assembly. It cracked, rendering the whole thing ($80 retail -- I got mine for about $40 off Amazon) inoperable. 

I went to the internet, hoping only to find that a replacement part might be available for purchase. In the process, I discovered that not only is such a thing available (for $10), but that Aqueon guarantees its products for life. Went to the website, did the ""Contact Us"" thing. Tuesday, got an email clarifying what part it was and they said they'd send a new one. No further questions, no rigmarole… just plain, simple, good business. 

Today (Friday), the [replacement part](http://imgur.com/a/Ouf0i) arrived in the mail. Four business day turnaround following a holiday weekend. It's hard to find that even when you're PAYING for a product.

I might, while I'm at it, add my endorsement of this extremely useful, labor-saving product. Before I bought my water changer, I had to lug 5-gallon buckets all through the house to change the water in my tanks. Now, I can do water changes even on weeknights when I've put in a long day at work. I was originally put off by the fact that the assembly mechanism is plastic. Now that I've received this excellent service, I'm really glad I didn't let that stop me. 

**TL;DR:** Aqueon provided great customer service, replacing a broken part on my water changer without any hassle whatsoever."	t5_2szbf	True

http://i.imgur.com/XpMoHbr.jpg

My first planted tank, a 6 gallon Fluval Edge with the 25W Heater.

Plants/Decor: Dwarf Baby Tears (Hemianthus callitrichoides) Oriental Sword (Echinodorus 'Oriental') Water Sprite (Ceratopteris thalictroides) Ruffle Plant (Echinodorus martii) Mopani Wood

1ml Excel Daily 1ml Flourish 2x a week

I know I probably didn't buy the most ideal plants for this tank, but first try and thought I would give it a shot. On trimming the Oriental Sword, I was thinking I would just cut the stem halfway once the leaf touches the top of the tank. Will a leaf grow back on the same stem? Do you think this is wise, or will it kill the plant?

What are your thoughts on using Nutrafin Cycle in the next couple days to get the tank starting to cycle. I’m planning on adding fish in the next 2-3weeks. Do you think 5 Neon Tetras and 5-10 Red Crystal Shrimp is too much for such a small tank? Will the shrimp disturb the dwarf tears rooting in the substrate?

I'm new to all this but extremely grateful for all the experience in this subreddit and also plantedtank.

We all perform tank maintenance. Sometimes, perfectly good plants end up in the trash, because they simply outgrow their limited environment. Why not share these plants with another hobbyist? This monthly thread offers a space where buyers and sellers can congregate, promote biodiversity, and make the world better.

**The Rules:**

1. Sellers, prices are encouraged to be as low as possible. These are plants you were willing to throw out, after all, so remember to [HABO](http://i.imgur.com/DZmJ0.png). Buyers, you will be responsible in covering the cost of shipping, at least. If a buyer is happy with the sale, please consider offering the seller more for their time spent packing and shipping.
2. The transaction details should be conducted via PM as reasonably as possible.
3. Please use a third-party payment organization like Paypal to conduct transactions, if it can't be done in person. This ensures the security of the buyer.
4. Always be wary of online scams. /r/PlantedTank, the mods, and Reddit hold no responsibility for your private transactions. You are liable. By participating in this thread, you agree to this.
5. ***DO NOT POST ANY PERSONAL INFO.*** Posting even your own personal info will result in a warning, and then a ban.
6. Use the usual WTB/WTS (willing to buy/willing to sell) acronyms at the beginning of your posts, along with the name of the plants.
7. Sellers are welcome to use creativity and fun when offering their stuff. Pick a number, favourite colour, most unusual story, ugliest face contest ([but be aware I will win](http://i.imgur.com/RQC0D.png)), etc.
8. Don't forget about /r/AquaSwap! Feel free to cross post between their sub and ours to maximize your advertizing power.

I've managed to speed up the process to where 2 gallons in a bucket takes about 3 days to become usable via a pond pump and airstone, but electricity-wise this doesn't really scale up.

Of course there's ""proper pH"" products, but those apparently buffer phosphate and kill plants, which severely limits my options species-wise and/or aesthetically.

I figure the solutions are:

1. max out my tank(s) at 10 gallons

2. spend a lot of money buying RO water from Whole Foods

3. spend a lot of money to scale up my current method of stabilizing the pH

We do have a very short list of rules, which are noted in the side bar.  I'd like to reiterate them here, just in case.  I know most people don't actually read the side bar.

1.  All ROAK-related posts or posts offering goods should be posted as a comment within the current month's [ROAK thread](http://redd.it/1fhftv).  This thread is stuck at the top of the subreddit page, so it is easily found.  We haven't been in the habit of actually removing posts that don't follow this rule, but if it gets bad enough we'll have to just for the sake of keeping the sub clean.  Also, don't forget about /r/AquaSwap.

2. If you report a post or comment, please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPlantedTank) and tell us why.  It's pretty likely we either won't see your report or else will just reapprove the comment/post unless it's blatant spam.  Remember, the report tool is not for reporting comments that you don't personally agree with, or comments you believe to contain false information.

3.  Don't use URL shorteners in comments or posts.  Comments or posts using URL shorteners will be removed.

1359295394.0	17d9rq	Starting a Walstad Tank...need advice	moralnihilist	15	2	21	"My wife and I started with a 15 gallon vertical tank, but I've convinced her to let me buy a ""real"" tank, so we finally got one last night. It was sold as a kit but it's a 37 gallon. I'm intrigued by the Walstad method and I have sort of a plan but I also have concerns.

My first concern is the logistics. We want to basically move everying from the 15 gallon into the 37 gallon. The problem is the new tank is going to occupy the same space as the old tank. My plan is this: Dirt the new tank with one inch of Organic potting soil and let the soil ""breathe"" for a day. Then, cover with one inch of sand, plant, decorate (taking the decorations and plants from the old tank), and fill it with a few inches of water.

Next, I'm going to siphon some of the water from the old tank into a clean bucket. Then, I plan on transferring the fish to the bucket, and then siphoning the rest of the water into it (this will be a big bucket).

Once the old tank is empty, I will then move it out of the way. Then (and here's what I'm really not sure about), my wife and I will move, slowly and carefully, the new tank to it's new location. I'm hoping this will be okay since there were barely be any water it in. 

Finally, we will carefully siphon most of the water from the bucket into the new aquarium, dump the fish in (or should we catch them individually?), and then fill the rest of the tank with treated water.

So, my first question is this. Obviously we're putting fish in a new tank right away, which is generally not a good idea. But is it okay because we're ""seeding"" it with 15 gallons of established aquarium water, established decorations, a BUTTload of plants (I will put a jungle in this thing), and a layer of soil to take care of the ammonia?

My second question regards the filter. This kit came with your standard, hang-on-the-back charcoal filter with a ""bio-wheel"" thing. From what I've read Walstad tanks don't really need that much filtration, but I was thinking of just having it on there ready to run just in case I need it. Should I just take the charcoal filter out and run it, not run it at all, or is there something else I can put in its place?

Thanks in advance, and please, feel free to poke holes in any part of my plan. That's why I'm posting.

P.S. If it matters, here's what's in my current tank:

* 2x Danio ""Glo-fish""
* 5x various Platys
* 2 Amazon Corys
* 4 Neon Tetras
* 1 Golden Algae Eater

As far as plants:

* 8x Italian Vallisneria
* 2x Amazon Swords. They're doing great and growing new leaves.
* 1x Something I can't identify but it's long with little leaves growing its entire length sort of like the vine on Super Mario Bros. but the top leaves are kind of pink.

There will be many, many more plants in the new aquarium. I'm planning on going nuts with plants."	t5_2szbf	True

Hey guys! First of all, I realize this build isn't perfect but I live in a trailer. Pretty awesome for trailer trash! We're replacing the floors, cabinets, etc. this winter when we have time off work. My brother, a friend, and myself just got drunked up and put this together last weekend and I thought I would share. Yes that is a motorbike in my living room. 

**The Build:** Cost 50$ - Linoleum with white wood trims and white doors.  (I got most of the material from the boss, and family for free cause it was ""extra"" stuff left over) We framed a small wall for the tank to sit on, with 2x6's on 12"" centers, this thing is built stronger than the walls in your house so don't worry about it breaking!

**The Aquarium:** 75 Gallon

**The ""Stuff"":** Fluval 405 Canister Filter, Heater, Air Pump, 48"" T5HO Light, Fluval Pressurized 88g-CO2, Miracle Gro Organic Choice Soil.

Now the fun can begin! I need gravel to cap the soil, plants, and Fish. *Keep in mind I live in Canada

**Gravel:** I like the black gravel Petsmart sells, it's kind of ""childish"" but I like it. Feel free to suggest different types of gravel. 

**Plants:** The tank is going to be seen from both sides so I want to stay away from huge ""back"" plants. Though I do want it to be heavily planted on both sides and much less in the middle. I like the look of broad leaf ludwigia, It'd be cool to carpet the middle of the tank, or some rocks or drift wood with Riccia Fluitans, or baby tears or something if possible. (not sure if it is, depending on the gravel I cap it with) Small plants would be better than big ones I'd think, aside from the two corners of the tank. 



**Fish:** I like Kissing Gouramis, but mostly smaller fish. I have some cichlids in my other 2 tanks that I can move into this one eventually if I want to. I like yellow labs, but they're too much to handle I think. Help would be great here.  "	t5_2szbf	True

However, especially in this instance, we are unwilling to make such a major change without the consensus of you, the user. I know I can speak for Mssrs. Whale and goots when I say that we very much enjoy the community here, and our goal is not to “lord it up” over you. Rather, our aim is to assist in running the forum in such a way that nurtures the environment of kindness, respect, and helpfulness that we all have going.

I quote from the Reddiquette:

&gt;“Vote. The up and down arrows are your tools to make Reddit what you want it to be. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.”

&gt;“Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, but only if you really think it might help the poster improve.”

&gt;“Please don’t mass-downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.”

&gt;“Plase don’t downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.”

We feel that the concept of downvoting in a small forum that is primarily focused on mentoring one another isn't particularly useful. We've noticed a few reasonable posts get downvoted once, and then disappear off the front page. That's a problem.

Note that removing the downvote button will **get rid of it for both threads and comments**.  There isn't a way to separate the two.

We genuinely want to know how you feel about this issue. Our goal is to make the best place it can possibly be for the lovers of this particular hobby. What say you?"	t5_2szbf	True

1343170510.0	x3l1g	Information about Carbon and Carbon Dioxide Injection in a Planted or Fish tank	Simpsoid	20	6	3	"I am no expert in this field but this is some information I have picked up in this hobby and thought I should share this with everyone here in case there is any information they need to reference. Feel free to ask me any questions or to discuss anything I have mentioned. There is no **TL;DR**, read this if you're interested in information about carbon usage in a planted or fish tank.

All known life needs Carbon to live and grow. This is especially important for plants that are predominantly composed of carbon. Carbon is provided by a number of ways into the water column of a fish / planted tank via either ""Bioavailable Carbon"" or Carbon Dioxide which has a chemical formula of ""CO2"", which means there is one Carbon atom for every 2 Oxygen atoms in a molecule (trees and plants get carbon from the atmosphere (CO2) as well as via compost and rotting wood (bioavailable carbon). This available carbon is absorbed by the plants during respiration and is used for building cell structure. General [Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_CO2) is absorbed into the water from the water surface and the absorption rate can be increased by adding in an airstone or agitating the surface area. CO2 is absorbed by the plants during their [Photosynthesis period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis) and Oxygen is a waste product that is expelled into the water column and used by any available organism that breathes (fish, snails, crustaceans etc.).

The airstone injects air (which contains the atmospheric CO2) into the water at increased [surface area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area) (lots of tiny bubbles increases the surface area of the gas creating an area greater than just the water surface of the tank). A greater surface area means that more gas is absorbed into the water. Adding in an air stone or an airhose from your filter can achieve this. [This is my tank](http://i.imgur.com/N2HEL.jpg) (Before I injected CO2). As you can see I have a hose attached from outside the tank that goes to the outlet port of my filter which blows air bubbles into the water. The pressure of the water flowing out of the filter sucks air through the hose (this is called the [Venturi effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect)) and blows it into the tank.

CO2 can also be added via [Fermentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation). This is often known as [""DIY CO2""](http://www.qsl.net/w2wdx/aquaria/diyco2.html). Yeast is added to sugar and as the yeast eats the sugar and ferments it produces alcohol, other compounds and CO2 gas. This gas is then injected into the water using a [diffuser](http://www.amazon.com/Nano-CO2-Diffuser-Reactor-Aquarium/dp/B0058XWDFO) (Which is similar to an airstone. Instead of large bubbles the airstone / diffuser ""pulverises"" the bubbles into a [fine mist](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QrLjKM-4L._SX450_.jpg) and this increases the surface area and causes more absorption of the CO2 into the water).

I use DIY CO2 for my tanks and in my setup I have done the following: I have placed water, sugar, baking soda ([Sodium Bicarbonate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate)) and yeast into a 600mL (20oz) water bottle (""Bottle A""). I then drilled a hole in the top of the bottle cap and ran some airhose tubing to another 600mL water bottle (""Bottle B""). I have Bottle B half-full of tap water. The outlet tubing from Bottle A goes to the bottom of the water in Bottle B. At the top of Bottle B I have an airhose come off and go to my diffuser which is at the bottom of my fish tank. The tubing has been glued in place using epoxy resin glue (Araldite) to provide a strong seal. Normal water / soft-drink bottles have a maximum pressure capacity of around 90 Pounds per Square Inch (PSI). Any greater pressure than this and they may explode. You can see an [example of what I did here](http://www.qsl.net/w2wdx/aquaria/separator.jpg). This entire setup cost me around $10 ($2 for water bottles, $2 for tubing, a bag of sugar for $3, yeast for $3 and I already had glue). I did buy a ""Nano Diffuser"" (For around $5 - search eBay) and a ""Drop Checker"" (For around $8, also known as a ""CO2 Indicator"").

What happens is the yeast ferments the sugar to produce alcohol and a by-product of CO2 gas. The CO2 production with this small setup happens for around 3 weeks depending on the amount of yeast used and the ambient temperature of your room. The second bottle (Bottle B) is used to filter (the bubbles go through the water) and also as a ""bubble counter"" which allows me to count how many bubbles of CO2 are produced every second (it's recommended that 1 bubble per second for DIY CO2).

* See my other post in here for my DIY CO2 recipe and instructions!

The second way of injecting CO2 is to use a compressed bottle of CO2 gas and force this into the tank. This is more expensive that DIY CO2 as the gas is under high pressure and requires components that operate under these conditions (as well as needing to refill the gas canister when it runs out). Generally the CO2 tank is connected to a regulator (which converts the high pressure (2000PSI) to low pressure (30-40PSI) for injection. A solenoid is [often attached](http://www.amazon.com/CO2-Adjustable-Flow-Pressure-Regulator/dp/B002P39I8U) to the regulator. The solenoid is an electronically controlled valve that means you can set a timer to open and close it and this allows you to automatically start and stop injecting gas during the plants photosynthesis period. Automation is one thing that DIY CO2 really lacks, I have to manually remember to open and close the valve on my filter air intake. A solenoid could be added to a DIY setup but the purpose of DIY is to provide CO2 to your tank cheaply.

The last way of getting Carbon to the plants is via adding it into the water column directly. [Flourish Excel](http://www.amazon.com/Seachem-453-Flourish-Excel-500ml/dp/B000256962) is an additive that breaks down to a form of Carbon that can be absorbed by the plants (much the same as trees absorbing carbon through their roots from compost / humus). The main compound of Flourish Excel is [Glutaraldehyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutaraldehyde) (which is at [1.5% concentration in Flourish Excel](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showpost.php?p=1175345&amp;postcount=10) along with other nutrients like Iron) which provides bioavailable carbon to the plants. The increase in carbon in the water column also reduces the ability for algae to grow so dosing this in the tank has added benefits as well.

Glutaraldehyde can be added as well as CO2 injection as they are two different compounds of Carbon that plants can absorb. Glutaraldehyde is more easily absorbed by the roots of the plants (and is great for plants with [Rhizomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizomes) like [Anubias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anubias) or [Java Ferns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_fern)) and CO2 is more easily absorbed by the leaves during the plants respiration, therefore with both Glutaraldehyde and CO2 added the plant is getting a double dose of Carbon that is required for all organisms to survive (after all we are [Carbon-based life forms!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life)).

1365523496.0	1bzv2e	Anyone with experience using the dry start method?	armbarred	14	2	9	"Hello all,

##Preface##
I have a few questions.  I have an established aquaponics set up at my place, which is similar in theory to a planted tank.  A few of the differences are that the plants are normally outside of the fish tank, and that there aren't too many nutrient injections like we see with planted tanks.

The nitrogen cycle is the same, though.

I stumbled upon this subreddit a while ago from /r/aquaponics, and I fell in love with how beautiful the tanks were.  Yesterday I got a 20 gallon long tank, and a glass lid for it.

I looked over the navigation links, and I read most of the stuff on there.

##Question Area##
I like the sound of the DSM (dry start method), as far as a long-term project goes.  It seems like something up my alley.  Looks pretty low-maintenance after the initial build, which is what I'm looking for.

So, does anyone have experience using the DSM?  Are there things I should be wary of?  The information that I found seems like it's still a bit experimental.

Just looking for some insight, advice based on experience and the like.


Another question is, would using [Riccia Fluitans](http://shop.plantedaquariumscentral.com/Riccia-Fluitans-2-x-3-portion-riccia23.htm) work using the DSM?  It looks like it has to be tied down, in order to be used as a ""carpeting"", so I'm not sure how it would fare in a DSM beginning.

And a final question, is there a resource on ""different types"" of planted tanks?  I looked around, but I didn't see anything really regarding that.  But it seems that there must be some type of way to help ""theme"" your tank.

I'm not affiliated with Aquabid or PAC in any way other than I sell occasionally on AB.

Here is an account of my experience:

**1. Selection and Prices: B-**
This is [what I purchased.](http://i.imgur.com/vGjxLnO)
The selection was better than average when compared to other retail sites. The plants are very accurately broken into different categories (beginner, foreground, stem plants etc). The prices are decent on most stem plants, and crypts. Their prices on Anubias, Java Moss, and Marimo balls are on par with other retail sites, but are expensive compared to typical auction prices. Keep in mind that there is no individual seller on Aquabid who has the same selection that PAC has so if you want the same plants you'll pay shipping to several different sellers. PAC wins if you're buying a package. Aquabid wins if you're buying a bundle from one seller (if the seller is a good seller). 

**Payment and Service: A+**

I paid with Paypal. My /r/plantedtanks discount worked flawlessly. Easy peasy. 

I completed my order during the weekend before MLK Jr Day soHeather, a service rep from PAC, emailed me to let me know that it might be optimal to delay shipping till Tuesday AND asked if I was okay with it. This was a smart and thoughtful move on their part and was much appreciated.

 **Shipping: B+**

PAC mailed my [large box](http://i.imgur.com/UEKOfiC) of plants through USPS and it arrived on Friday (took three days). The [packaging](http://i.imgur.com/YWiFxRX) was very adequate and included a newspaper wrapped, insulated, and plastic bagged (sealed, not ziplocked). It was insulated well enough that none of the plants suffered any losses even in below freezing weather (consistent 30F in OR this week). The only reason PAC didn't receive an A from my on shipping is because certain ""Aquasellers"" on Aquabid go WAY OVERBOARD on packaging standards. I've opened styro boxes with individually wrapped heat packs, plants, packing peanuts etc - a standard that must be expensive and isn't usually needed. PAC's packaging was appropriate to the conditions.

Another nice touch - PAC taped a [warning](http://i.imgur.com/n6orpZc) to the outside of the package notifying the buyer of the fiber glass inside. Classy. 

They also put a plant acclimating [reminder](http://i.imgur.com/2YyhYNB) with the plants. Thoughtful.

**Quality and Quantity of Plants: A+**

This is where PAC really shines. The condition of the plants matched the description on the website, but many extras were included on the less expensive plants. This rarely happens through Aquabid auctions because sellers want to list as many plants as possible to drive bidding up.

Here is a breakdown of what I bought.

[ROTALA WALLICHII](http://i.imgur.com/6L7HHy1) Ordered 1, got 3.

[Bacopa Caroliniana](http://i.imgur.com/jvijL4a) (listed on PAC and many other sites as Bacopa ""Carolina"") Ordered 1 got 2.

[Alternanthera reineckii](http://i.imgur.com/Cfq129B) Ordered 1 got 2. 

[Rotala ""Magenta""](http://i.imgur.com/1yoKCuE)

[Crypt Retrospiralis](http://i.imgur.com/2a5eCRO)

[Crypt ""Mi Oya"" Red](http://i.imgur.com/lyLrKd8)

[Echinodorus ""Red Rubin""](http://i.imgur.com/OW2EwkF)

The other two swords look very similar besides a small difference in height and the number of leaves. I truly can't tell which is which.

[Echinodorus Kleiner Prinz](http://i.imgur.com/q98dYR2)

[Echinodorus ""Red Flame"" Sword](http://i.imgur.com/JIgo2iM)

**Conclusion:**

I would highly recommend Plantedaquariumscentral.com for beginners and people after a lot of plants. I rarely see plant packages of the quality and quantity I purchased on Aquabid. That being said, sometimes you can get lucky and snipe an auction at a low price and really make out. I'd consider PAC to be a sure bet type of retail site. You'll pay a competitive price for great quality, quantity, customer service, and shipping. 

I will consider PAC along with Aquabid when shopping for plants in the future and they will now be my go-to recommendation for all the newb algae growers looking for plants.

We all perform tank maintenance. Sometimes, perfectly good plants end up in the trash, because they simply outgrow their limited environment. Why not share these plants with another hobbyist? This monthly thread offers a space where buyers and sellers can congregate, promote biodiversity, and make the world better.

We've decided to pair this thread with the monthly [photo contest thread](http://redd.it/149g1f), with the hopes that with all the pruning you are doing to make your tanks ready for submission (you are submitting your tank, right?), you have some extra plants that could use a second lease on life.

**The Rules:**

1. Sellers, prices are encouraged to be as low as possible. These are plants you were willing to throw out, after all, so remember to [HABO](http://i.imgur.com/DZmJ0.png). Buyers, you will be responsible in covering the cost of shipping, at least. If a buyer is happy with the sale, please consider offering the seller more for their time spent packing and shipping.

2. The transaction details should be conducted via PM as reasonably as possible.

3. Please use a third-party payment organization like Paypal to conduct transactions, if it can't be done in person.

4. Always be wary of online scams. /r/PlantedTanks, the mods, and Reddit hold no responsibility for your private transactions. You are liable. By participating in this thread, you agree to this.

5. ***DO NOT POST PERSONAL INFO.***

6. Use the usual WTB/WTS (willing to buy/willing to sell) acronyms at the beginning of your posts, along with the name of the plants.

7. Sellers are welcome to use creativity and fun when offering their stuff. Pick a number, favourite colour, most unusual story, ugliest face contest ([but be aware I will win](http://i.imgur.com/RQC0D.png)), etc.

**Shipping Instructions:**

Please review [this thread](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showthread.php?t=71992) for some insight on how to properly ship plants.

1352092503.0	12nj6h	Dry Start Method: Dwarf Baby Tears (HC)		13	1	9	"I always see questions about DSM and how to properly go about the procedure, so here is my input. This will be my 6th dry start in this tank and so far I've only had problems with 1 of them (details explained later). When you have an infinite supply of plants like Amano, it is easy to get a tank started with dense plant coverage and have an amazing setup right from the beginning. I can't afford to buy 20 pots of HC, so the DSM is a savior.

**Tank**: standard 10 gallon

**Light**: Coralife 96watt PC fixture 

**Substrate**: ADA AquaSoil Amazonia and Flourite Dark

**Carpeting plant**: Hemianthus callitrichoides aka ""Dwarf Baby Tears""

First step is to get the substrate laid down and sloped how you want it. The slope is 90% Flourite Dark and capped with AquaSoil. I chose this route because Amano recently started adding ""Powersand"" to his tanks (basically a porous substrate that allows water flow and bacteria housing to maximize plant root health).

[Sloped](http://i.imgur.com/Jt43x.jpg)

The next step is to break up the HC into smaller portions to get the most coverage possible. **The absolute best way to plant HC in a dry start is to just ""sprinkle"" it on the substrate and refrain from pushing it into the soil**

[Sprinkle](http://i.imgur.com/vJ3UL.jpg)

[FTS](http://i.imgur.com/YOunI.jpg)

Once you have all the HC placed in the tank, take a spray bottle with plain tap water and mist the tank until the soil is nice and saturated, but not to the point that there is standing water. The 1 dry start that was a disaster had puddles of water, which provided a nice environment for blue-green algae. I'll say it again, no standing water in the tank. If you mist the tank one day and see there is water building up, use airline tubing and siphon as much out as possible.

[BGA](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/pHosting.php?do=show&amp;type=f&amp;id=12176&amp;title=bgac.jpg)

Cover the tank with something to maintain high humidity or else the HC will dry out and die. I use glass tops with saran wrap on this tank. Note: a standard 10 gallon is the perfect size for using saran wrap as a single strip covers the top.

**Photoperiod**: 12 to 16 hours

**Water misting**: Once a day (briefly uncover the tank to spray water)

**Air exchange**: Twice a week (take cover off tank and allow new air in for about 10 minutes)"	t5_2szbf	True

Here's what I use:

For general equipment and tools I like Fluval's products, they are sturdy and attractive.

For plant nutrition I use Seachem's fertilizers, I really like the AquaVitro line.  In my experience, it is very effective and flexible while still being easy to use.

I also like Seachem's substrate, but I do prefer CaribSea's Eco-Complete.  Roots grab onto it much more than other substrates I have worked with.

Since I have two filters running on my 55g, it quickly became apparent that I needed to control the floating plants from spinning all over the place in the center of the tank.

The salvina minima is comprised of...thousands, I'd guess...of floating plantlets that don't attach to one another. They grow fast, and is considered an invasive species that clogs important waterways in certain US states. I was able to manage it by taking an extra piece of 1/4-inch airline tubing and turning it into a floating corral, by attaching both ends together with a connecting barb. When the salvinia expands against the corral, it interlocks with the other plantlets, and forms a moveable floating mat that doesn't get in the way during water changes.

For the water wisteria, I purchased a clear plastic suction cup [soap dish](http://i.imgur.com/DPPR3.jpg) and stuck the ends of the plants into the square holes. Works great and keeps everything secure!"	t5_2szbf	True

Currently Nitrates are about 20ppm, which is the highest it's been in a long while. Lately my water change schedule hasn't been less predictable so I'm sure that's part of it. But I seem to remember, even when being a bit lax on water changes, that Nitrate would usually be no more than 10ppm.

Should I just be more aggressive about water change amounts? I would usually do about 18L (5 gallons) once a week but if I went a few more extra days, I would do more like 24-38L.

The Finnex model which is far superior is only $150. Although there are no moonlights, I posted a thread earlier on [homemade moonlights that cost under $10](http://imgur.com/a/c0z31). I spoke to the owner of the site and he plans on bringing the entire Finnex line to Canada.

this will be about as 6 feet wide, and like 50 feet long. About four to five feet deep. Good substrate. And an iugumi style setup with hair grass, the longer variety that's grows like 6 inches. Massive lighting system. Insane c02. The rocks would be petrified wood, to make a rough mountain top then work down to a feild and a fairly large black sandy area. It's ok if it fills in but it will be nice while it last. I would only do one plant species because I would want this tank to look good for a long time, although if you chose two tight growing carpet plants it would be interesting to watch them grow together and maybe even form sort of territory's. oh so many carpet plants to choose. What to would you choose? I also have trouble on if I could pick a moss. I love how the mosses look, oh good god christmas moss! But I fear it would take over and moss kinda looks dingy when it's taking over another plants area.

For fish I would go with small fish. I would start with a school of 1000 cardinal tetras, then from there I would adjust the number because I bet they will separate and not school well in to large of a number. Especially when in a tank with no threats.  So yeah figure out the optimum size for a school of fish then lower it roughly 20 percent. Since I have no clue if it would be 1000 fish or ten thousand fish ill just stick with schools for size.


1 school of cardinal tetras, I would be stunned by the beauty.

1school rummy nose tetras. Racing through the tank, they school so tight it is incredible.

1000 celestial pearl danios' maybe more, depends if they kinda stick together or spread. They will look nice in the lower area, they are good fish to watch, they have interesting behavior. They are my personal favorite fish they remind me of the woods and camping. They look much like trout. I feel they are the aquarium fish I most identify with.

Couple hundred scarlet badis. Male and female. The gems of the tank. I can't have to many they are so beautiful they will be kinda special to see. They have very small territory's, that would be fun to watch.

1 school of Boraras brigittae, my citizens of the tank, their beauty will come from the numbers, so many tiny fish will make one flowing school.

Several discus, the kind that are brown and blue with like a maze on their sides. Or just not the unnatural looking ones. They will be the Buddhas of the tank. Peacefully large beautiful fish

Thousands or cherry red shrimp. The only reason not crystal reds is because cherrys breed better, and are more hardy. They are the workers. The robots. 

Im not sure if I would need several aggressive fish to sort of keep the schools together, that will take experimenting.

And a good fleet of a very pretty variety of corydoras. My army of brutes, who clean up and bump into each other. The stooges, we all love them.

That would be my heaven. To be able to witness that, in a beautiful tank, with clear water.  If designed well enough it would be a fairly stable tank, no trimming. It would need a really advanced filtration system, perhaps a massive sump then through a pool type filter.  The daily 20 percent water changes would also clean the filter.  The filter would get the water through many small hoses behind a large screen so not all that water is being sucked into one hole taking my fish with it. Sometimes I think that if I really try hard and save enough money I could maybe build this and make it a reality... Probably not though so I guess I will have to stick with my nano tanks in my nano apartment.

The idea for this post was inspired during a chat in junkpile1's [Redneck Form Over Function](http://redd.it/1ac1yp) thread, where we discussed the possibility of creating a canister filter out of an Olde English 800 Malt Liquor beer can. So please, bear with me.

Almost all planted tank forums have ""beautiful tank"" threads and photo contests. We have one too. What they don't show is the hours of hard work and **failed attempts** that lead up to a masterpiece.

I want this forum to show new hobbyists all of the stupid, embarrassing, and probably dangerous mistakes the veterans have made to get to where they are today -- so they can see for themselves what kind of dedication and perseverance this hobby requires.

I believe that the failures are the most important part of what makes an outstanding, knowledgeable, and humble aquarist. These failures should be acknowledged, shared, and learned from.

Now, I want to start dosing some fertilizers so I can help keep my plants healthy, and I would (obviously)want algae to stay in the tank for the clean up crew.

Now, I was wondering if you guys could advise my on dosing chemicals(especially Iron, my floating plants are beginning to pale) to promote algae and plant growth. We've sort of fallen in love with the two otos and the snail so I want them to be especially happy. :)

We all perform tank maintenance. Sometimes, perfectly good plants end up in the trash, because they simply outgrow their limited environment. Why not share these plants with another hobbyist? This monthly thread offers a space where buyers and sellers can congregate, promote biodiversity, and make the world better.

We've decided to pair this thread with the monthly [photo contest thread](http://redd.it/15rt1v), with the hopes that with all the pruning you are doing to make your tanks ready for submission (you are submitting your tank, right?), you have some extra plants that could use a second lease on life.

**The Rules:**

1. Sellers, prices are encouraged to be as low as possible. These are plants you were willing to throw out, after all, so remember to [HABO](http://i.imgur.com/DZmJ0.png). Buyers, you will be responsible in covering the cost of shipping, at least. If a buyer is happy with the sale, please consider offering the seller more for their time spent packing and shipping.

2. The transaction details should be conducted via PM as reasonably as possible.

3. Please use a third-party payment organization like Paypal to conduct transactions, if it can't be done in person.

4. Always be wary of online scams. /r/PlantedTanks, the mods, and Reddit hold no responsibility for your private transactions. You are liable. By participating in this thread, you agree to this.

5. ***DO NOT POST PERSONAL INFO.***

6. Use the usual WTB/WTS (willing to buy/willing to sell) acronyms at the beginning of your posts, along with the name of the plants.

7. Sellers are welcome to use creativity and fun when offering their stuff. Pick a number, favourite colour, most unusual story, ugliest face contest ([but be aware I will win](http://i.imgur.com/RQC0D.png)), etc.

**Shipping Instructions:**

Please review [this thread](http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/showthread.php?t=71992) for some insight on how to properly ship plants.

Since this is only the third go-around, [please let the mods know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPlantedTank) if you have any suggestions to make this better!"	t5_2szbf	True

**The Rules**

1. Images must be hosted by imgur

2. The subject of your photo must be an aquarium

3. A user will not be eligible to win the contest more than once every six months, or 180 days

4. Photos can be old or recent, but must be of the submitter's personally owned tank. If this comes into question by the users or the mods, proof will need to be provided (like a picture of your tank with a ""hi /r/plantedtank! 8/24/12"" sign)

5. The winner will be determined by total number of upvotes. Downvotes will not be considered.

6. Submissions must be made by 2400 Pacific Standard Time (0100 CST, 0300 EST) on December 31, 2012.  The voting thread will be posted on January 1, and the winner will be announced on January 7.

7. Submissions will only be accepted via this thread.  Comments not containing picture submissions will be deleted so it’s easier for the mods to compile the voting thread.

8. You must include a photo “title” with your picture link.  This is due to the format of the voting thread; user names will not be included to encourage voting upon merit and not who the photo or tank belongs to.  It doesn't have to be anything super creative either, simply ""55g planted"" will be fine.  We just need text to link back to your picture.

**Remember**

1. You MAY submit an album of photos, but it needs to be limited to 3 pictures

2. As a community, you have decided to judge on auquascape ONLY; please use your discretion

I'm trying my hand at live plants.  Some of my plants have completely brown leaves and other leaves have brown splotches.  Should I remove those?

I'm not sure if you need all of the info in the sidebar to answer my question, but just in case:  

29 gallon freshwater, cycled and plants added two months ago.  
Plants:  Amazon swords, anubias, crested Java fern  
Fish: 7 glowlight tetras, 3 sterbai cories, 1 pygmy cory, 1 guppy (planning to add 4 more sterbai cories, the pygmy is leftover from a group of 5 but 4 died, and the guppy was a freebie thrown in when it was a baby)  
Ammonia 0, Nitrites 0, Nitrates 10ppm  
Using a three month old liquid test kit (API Master Test Kit)  

I'm using a root tab on the swords (API brand) and a liquid fertilizer for the other two (also API brand).  I'm planning to add API CO2 booster next time I make it to my LFS.

We here at /r/plantedtank have come up with an exciting monthly endeavor we hope you’re going to enjoy.  Each month, the mods will be holding a photo contest.

**The Prizes**

- One month of Reddit Gold, provided by the mods

- The winning picture will be featured on that month's submit button at the top of the page!

- Your Reddit user name at the top of the sidebar, in all its glitzy glory, with a link to your picture, your profile, or your tank journal (your choice)

- A special background color for your user flair text so it stands out a little more!*

**The Purpose**

/r/plantedtank has really grown over the last months, and we're trying to keep that trend going.  We've got some other ideas in the works, but these things are slow going as each of us in turn are hard working people with full time jobs.  This contest will hopefully increase traffic, and give you another outlet for the beautiful pictures you all take (like for robotsong's Weekly Thread, [check it out](http://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/yh7pn/rplantedtank_weekly_journal_1/)!).

**The Specifics**

This contest will be held monthly, with the submission thread posted by a mod 72-96 hours before the beginning of each month.  Submissions will only be accepted as comments in the posted thread, and only for that three to four day period, which will end at midnight on the last day of the month.  Then, on the first of the month, a voting thread will be created and all users will be able to choose their personal favorite via upvote.  No comments will be accepted on the voting thread, and downvotes won't be considered.  The winner will be announced on the 7th of each month (so the sub has a whole week to vote!), and their prizes awarded within 24 hours.

**The Rules**

1. Images must be hosted by [imgur](http://imgur.com/)

2. The subject of your photo must be an aquarium, and a photo ""title"" must be provided upon submission

2. A user will not be eligible to win the contest more than once every six months, or 180 days

3. Photos can be old or recent, but must be of the submitter's personally owned tank. If this comes into question by the users or the mods, proof would need to be provided (like a picture of your tank with a ""hi /r/plantedtank! 8/24/12"" sign)

4. The winner will be determined by total number of upvotes.  Downvotes will not be considered.

**How can you participate?**

Submit your photos to the contest!  The mods will also facilitate prize donations (items, money, Reddit Gold subscriptions, services, whatever you'd like to give!).  I personally would like to give a lot more to the winners, but there's only so much a single person can do.  I expect I'll be throwing in a little something extra every few months!

I added plants to my standing community fish tank about six weeks ago and they are not doing so hot.  Notably, they aren't dead (yet) - they just aren't thriving.  From reading this sub and things linked from it, I've already figured out that I made one mistake when I added plants to my existing tank - no food.  While I fix that, I'm wondering what else I should swap out to make life better for the entire tank.  I want to have a 100% planted tank and no ugly plastic, but I clearly need to get a hang of things or I'll just torture more plants.

My current setup is as follows: 29 gal. tank (in inches: 31.8 long x 20.5 high x 14 wide), gravel substrate, florasun bulb in the hood, 50W heater, and aqueon carbon cartridge filter.  For ornaments, I have 2 pieces of glass rock, 2 very tall plastic plants, one combo cave/plant, and four shorter plants scattered around the sides of the tank. 

My fish community consists of: 5 green glow tetras, 4 penguin tetras, 4 gold pristella tetras. I will eventually add more fish - I plan to stick with community fish overall, but I've been contemplating a bushy-nosed pleco as well.
My plants are: 1 amazon sword and 1 wysteria.  
My chemistry is: dGH = 1, pH = 7.4, ammonia, nitrates, nitrites = undetectable.

Style: I like the highly organized and heavily planted dutch style of aquaculture, but I definitely want to leave room for my fish to swim around.  I like biotopes, but I have frankenfish, so that seems completely inappropriate.  I know my current setup is sparse, but I don't like it that way; I have been waiting to figure out plants before I filled it up.  I love the green carpet of plants that I've seen in some tanks online.  I want plants to obscure the back and provide little hiding places for the fish.  I'm compulsive with performing one of four maintenance tasks each Sunday and water testing on Tuesday evenings (more frequently when I make any change to the tank.)  That said, I don't want to add a lot more work and equipment.  I'd like the fish and the plants to be harmonious. 

Obviously I need to add plant food.  Should I also slowly add some more plant friendly substrate?  Do a partial substrate swap?  Do I need to get my hardness up a bit? Would it be better for the plants if there were more of them?  I think the grasses look AMAZING - if I modify my substrate, can this be a possibility?

Fish loss to me is horrible, so minimizing that possibility is important.  Notably, the fish are doing better with the plants, so I'm committed to making plants work.

Thanks for your advice!

Edit: Sorry! Added tank dimensions, ornaments, and style section above.

1374049327.0	1ih33r	New Tank Surprise! (Lots of pics)	Cadillakakak	14	3	5	"A coworker wanted to get rid of his 28 gallon bow front tank setup and offered it to me for free. I didn't know what all he was getting rid of but I told him I'd take it. I've been raising rainbow fish fry in a ten gallon and thought of this as an opportunity to get rid of it and upgrade to something nicer.


Turns out, the tank came with a [stand](http://i.imgur.com/nmSUmiY), a [fluval canister filter](http://i.imgur.com/RX4iyEx), a light, an enormous fake tree stump, an air pump, and a ton of extras. After he sent me pics of everything I decided to kick him $50 and some hunting ammo (he calls the ammo ""boxes of gold"").


Well, I wanted to cycle the tank before putting my 20 rainbowfish fry (seller sold them to me cheap because he didn't know how many were Sexlineata and how many were Boesemani). So i planted the tank with pots from my  [garage stock tank](http://i.imgur.com/GbyQEPz) (stocked with Boesemanis and [Longfin Albino Plecos](http://i.imgur.com/0ZHIVxN) I've been trying to breed). The light that came with the tank was a garbage T8 or T12 so I placed the tank in front of the window in my breakfast nook and filled it with low light plants.  [Crypts](http://i.imgur.com/zxEZC3W)made the most sense so the tank houses Lutea,  [Spiralis](http://i.imgur.com/WgRaIUi), Wendtii ""Green Gecko"", and Mi Oya red. I threw in all the small bits of various Java Fern species I have from both my tanks and a rhizome of Bolbitus I had in my  [125g Rainbow show tank](http://i.imgur.com/8MWq3De). Last but not least I put in a massive Anubias I've been neglecting to trim.

The tank N levels never went crazy and the tank cycled very quickly because I didn't clean the filter or the gravel he gave me. Good thing too because something I put in the tank had Rainbow eggs on it! I've got about  [50 little fry](http://i.imgur.com/QGXWeEs) tooling around in there now. I'm feeding them two or three times a day (micro worms and Hikari First Bites)

Chances are highest that they're Boesemanis but they might also be Dwarf Neons, Macchulochi, [Irian Reds](http://i.imgur.com/5n8fl9U), some kind of Trifasciata, or hybrids. I'm hoping they'll be Boesemanis!

So now I've got a 125g Walstad with 30 or so adult Rainbows of many varieties, a 72g Walstad with 5 Adult Boesemanis, a 10g walstad quarantine tank with 18 Boesemani/Sexlineata, and a 28g Walstad potted fry tank with 50 or so baby rainbows (species to be determined).

28g bio load:

50ish Rainbow fish fry

1 bajillion pond snails

13 happy Assassin Snails

10 or so Neocaridina (hitchhikers)

I have a ton of light, but after doing some more online reading on growing HC and such, I'm now worried that this light isn't broad enough spectrum to really be effective. 

What's the general verdict on using LED's in planted tanks? Should I switch it out for one of the SHO lights I should be getting setup this week? The specs on the SHO are: 6400K Full Spectrum Daylight, 84 CRI - 56 Lumens per Watt, 7000 lumen output. I can't find specs on the Aqueon LED strips, and the company never got back to me after I emailed them. 

Am I in trouble unless I switch?

Tank Specs: 20 gallon tall (2 ft high), lights are ~1.5 inches off the water, no glass or such between the light and the water, dosing with liquid ferts, CO2 at 1 bubble per second with a glass diffuser and right into the intake. Right now I've got some HC, amazon swords, a crypt, some small java ferns, some moss, and maybe adding some riccia flutens and water sprite soon. I put in a wide variety to see what will grow well in this setup and then limit the plants after. I've got a 3 betta sorority and 7 harlequin rasboras.

Everything has been great so I finally decided to add a few more fish that I purchased from Petsmart 2 days ago. Now I see that was a mistake I got my other fish from Petco with no problems. I bought 3 neon tetras to round me out to having 10 total. I purchased 2 cories to make 4 total. I bought 5 blue guppies as a new addition. I already had 3 snails, 2 frogs, 1albino bristlenose, 1 regular, and 3 ghost shrimp. I don't feel like this was overcrowding my moderately planted tank but maybe I was wrong. Long story short I woke up to 4 dead fish (1 guppy, 2 cories, 1 bristlenose algae eater) 2 dead snails and 2 dead shrimp. My betta had white around his mouth this morning so I rushed to the pet store to buy aquarium salt and ""betta fix."" It didn't work sadly, he passed away tonight and I am still very upset. I tested the water myself and it was normal and Petco tested it as well and the parameters were normal. I am assuming I caught something from the new fish and it killed several of my old ones. I did not add the store water to my tank and used a net to transfer. I am not ready to buy new fish just yet but I am very leery of using either of those stores anymore.

The guy I traded with didn't have any $$, so I decided to just trade. It feels awesome and I wish more people were like this.

I occasionally sell/get rid of fish and plants on craigslist, but today I realized I wish there were more local shops out there that really help people out with their aquariums in western Wisconsin (La Crosse area). Everyone I meet here that's really into tanks has some good info, but seem to lack the information on planted tanks/shrimp.  

We have a couple LFS' in the area, one of which I would not purchase fish from and the other has iffy fish on occasion. The petco and petsmart seem ok for fish, but that's it. 

I guess what I'm realizing is getting into the aquarist hobby requires finding your resources and networking with other people. I've been working on tanks for years, basically since I was a kid (23 now) and I've only picked up the hobby again 4 years ago (yet it seems longer). 

We share our aquariums through photographs and videos online, but what about experiencing them in person? Wouldn't it be cool to have local people display their aquariums for the public to see? I guess it would be similar to having an aquarium show, but I've never been to one. 

I dunno, does anyone have any ideas, thoughts? This is just my string of thought right now, but I get the feeling the hobby is very limited when it comes to in-person resources. Would it not be awesome to walk into a LFS and they have all sorts of substrates, plants, fish, etc to choose from??

So this is my new 5gal crescent tank. I thought I had a clear idea when I was starting this but it's just looking so bare! Any suggestions as to what I should do with the java moss? In the first picture it was just floating up front, and in the second I tucked in behind on the right. I really love the wood piece... I was thinking about maybe attaching the java moss to that.

I'm also having a really hard time getting the roots to my water sprite in the back left to stay down. They have super, super long roots so I just had to sort of ball them up to try to get them down. Could I prune the roots without hurting the plant?

Let me know how it looks upon first glance, and if you think any of the placement is a little off. I've been reading a lot about this but it's a lot harder then I thought!
