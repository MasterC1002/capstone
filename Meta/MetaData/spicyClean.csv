While it's not for people who are averse to spice, fuck those people. This recipe will have motherfuckers calling you Moadib, because you control the spice, and that shit is life. 

You'll need:

* 1 tsp. olive oil 

* One pound of fresh jalapeños. (Or serranos, if you want to be a chonch about it)

* a cup of Parmesan cheese

* one of those 8 oz. bricks of cream cheese, and not that light bullshit, get the real thing, you fat fuck. 

* Chorizo. (If its one of those rings, use half. If its one of those 2-tube numbers use one of the tubes)

* some of your favorite hot sauce (I use spontaneous combustion or ass blaster)

* 2 beers

* some music, because cooking without music is just standing around in front of a stove like a dick. 

**okay, let's make this shit:**


1. Open one of the beers and let it breathe.

2. Preheat the oven to about 420, then laugh about it you fucking hippie. 

3. Heat that oil in a medium pan. How hot? High medium. I set my stove to a six.  Let that shit heat and spread. You know, like your mother. 

4. Drink some of that beer.

5. Make the chorizo.  You know, heat it up and smash it until its all crumbly and delicious. Really cook the shit out of it, you need it crispy. Drain the oil when you're done.  

6. Slice those peppers in half, lengthwise. For fuck's sake don't touch your eyes.  Or your dick. 

7. Finish off that first beer and think about what you've done. 

8. Mix the cream cheese, Parmesan and chorizo together until its blended all together. Add hot sauce to taste. 

9. Spoon that shit into the pepper halves and arrange them in a big ass baking dish. 

10. Throw the whole fucking thing into the oven for 20 minutes or so and knock back that second beer. By the time it's done you'll be buzzed enough to not care if you fucked something up along the way. 

11. Eat up, buttercup.

My theory is that the same target taste buds that fuel our need for the heat are at play that allow us to not taste bitterness like most people but the pleasant flavor of the coffee. Although, I could be horribly, horribly wrong here.

So /r/spicy, how do you take your coffee?

JuanHubero	74	11	73	As someone who loves pepperjack and other cheeses containing jalapenos, habaneros, etc., I really wish that there were more options for cheeses containing chiles like the bhut jolokia, trinidad scorpion, ghost scorpion, yellow 7 pod, and several others.  If I could purchase blocks of cheese, or even just deli slices to use on burgers/sandwiches, I'd be one very happy chilehead.  Anyhow, what are some chile varieties you would like to see used in specialty cheeses?  (Also, if you happen to know of any cheeses containing super hots that are already out there, please share the links below.)	t5_2s1qd	True

Eventually one very honest waitress told me that because I was white, they were worried I wouldn't be able to eat truly spicy food and would send it back. 

Even when I assured them that this was not the case, my receipts showed that they put in my orders as medium spicy. They weren't being rude, but they really seem to believe that I couldn't possibly want the really hot stuff.

Since we've been together, her tolerance and consumption have steadily increased and she now routinely eats very hot food a few times a week.

I've noticed a direct correlation between the amount of spicy food she's been eating, and the strength of flavour of her vagina. Is this a common thing? 

As I've always eaten spicy food, the reverse has not been noted for me, however she always says I taste good, and swallows down my seed like a champ.

PoorCollegeGuy	35	6	22	"Today I tried [The Marine](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/note.php?note_id=165862560111995), and while it was an extremely nice burn, it crawled down my throat and I was only able to finish about 3/4ths of it. It also had special edition [Mad Dog 357](http://firegirl.com/1259-02.html), which is apparently rated at ~~6 million scoville~~ 600k-800k scoville (Thanks TheKingOfPoon).

The burn wore off fairly quickly, but as I sit here writing this I get absolutely intense stomach pain and I really do feel like I'm dying, although I was assured that I would feel like this when ordering the burger. I've never felt so much pain before, and I've broken bones in the past. I'm wondering if there is a way I can reduce these flashes of pain, as they are bordering unbearable.

I've tried the following with varying levels of success:

* Cold Shower
* Cold Water
* Puking (This helped quite a bit, and gave me some time of relief, but it has returned again)
* Laying still in bed
* Writhing around in pain

I'm still getting ridiculous amounts of pain every 10-15 minutes and it lasts for about 10 minutes each time. I think I've thrown up all the bhut jolokia, but I can't be sure. Ideas?

Update: Well, I've made it out alive, what a ride it was. Knowing these tricks with how to prepare and what to eat before and following it, I may give it another attempt, thanks a bunch guys!"	t5_2s1qd	True
1306349014.0	hjzpu	Jamaican style habanero sauce - fruity, spicy and hot.	Pharaoh_Chromium	32	0	15	"I've been making this hab sauce for about 15 years now.

[I grow my own peppers.](http://i.imgur.com/rTo7T.jpg) Those are habaneros and red savinas

[Here's the setup.](http://i.imgur.com/RrIen.jpg)

[Blender full with palate cooler.](http://i.imgur.com/xTa1z.jpg)

[Finished product](http://i.imgur.com/ODd7L.jpg) with homemade labels

It's supposed to be Jamaican style (I couldn't swear to it) - it's hot, sweet, sour and has the flavor of curry and mustard. It tastes pretty hot, but doesn't burn your mouth like some sauces, but after a little while you'll notice your scalp is sweating like mad.

    12 or more fresh habanero chiles - roughly chopped, seeded
    1 Ripe mango - peel, pit, mash
    1 c Cheap yellow prepared mustard
    1/4 c Brown sugar - packed
    1/4 c White vinegar
    1 tb Prepared curry powder
    1 tb Ground cumin
    1 tb Chili powder
    Salt and freshly cracked black pepper - to taste

No need to cook it - just throw it all in a blender, adding the liquid toward the end to get the consistency right. I use mangoes and pineapple. **I just use the recipe as a base, and fudge it quite a bit.**  One year I made some with just red savinas, which was super hot. I used canned pineapple and mango here because I couldn't find decent fresh ones at the time.

* 2  Tbsp. dried crushed red chile pepper or chili flakes (more if you can take it, less if wuss )

* 2 garlic cloves
* 1/2 squeezed lemon
* 3-4-5 Tbsp olive oil (until it's a nice paste, like thick grainy mustard)
* Salt to taste

---
 **How to:**

* 1) Grind the spices thoroughly in a mortar and pestle. (adding some salt when grinding makes it easier)

* 2) Add cloves, pound until a thick paste.

* 3) Add the Lemon juice, Olive oil until it's a nice goo, salt to taste.

* 4) Done. Eat with anything. (why not lamb roast, any barbecued meat, merguez sausages, grilled Squid, Halloumi salad, kebab, pizza, hamburgers, mix with mayo, use as a marinade...... )

* 5) Enjoy legendary status among friends, benefits of improved diet, joys of being badass.

--------------------------------------------------------------


 **Variations:**

* Soak the dried chile in a dash of boiling water for 20 min before grinding.

* Add chopped fresh chiles, or roasted (see below)

* Lightly dry-roast the cumin and coriander seeds before grinding (adds smokiness, depth)

* Add 3 Tbsp. Hungarian sweet paprika and some extra oil (to make it more sweet, paprikish)
or
* Add 3 Tbsp. Sriracha chile sauce ( recommended!, adds depth )

* A pinch of sugar can also lift the taste, try it. (not needed if adding sweet paprika or roasted peppers, see below)

* Add Caraway seeds too ( 1-2 Tbsp ), a nice variant, especially for Couscous.

* Some people like to add skinned,mashed tomato.

* Add chopped shalottes, chopped tomatoes and fresh coriander leaves for a heavenly fresh salsa/salad.

NOTE:
**A very much recommended** twist on this sauce is to chuck a whole red bell pepper (paprika/capsicum) or two in the oven on max heat, turning it until soft and blackened all around. (You can also burn the paprika over open fire until black.) Then rest them in a bowl under plastic wrap until they cool down a bit, and peel off (most of) the blackened skin. Then fillet the paprika, chop it up finely or mash it and add to the sauce.. (If you are a Chile-head you do this same thing with large red chillies like Rocoto!) The resulting roasted paprika mash gives a sweet, deep flavour that enrichens the sauce, and as a matter of fact, your life.""

Very simple but delicious and I figured I could add in something spicy and give it my own flare! Photo album is [here](http://imgur.com/a/bjNul).

Carmelized onions and garlic in a large skillet, added diced [Fatalii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalii) peppers and simmered for a few minutes. Once it was smelling really nice, I added the brussels sprouts (halved) and cooked on high heat until some leaves fell off and the sprouts were browned.

While doing this, I whisked together a bit of soy sauce, olive oil, and lemon juice. Added coarsely ground black pepper and a dash of salt. Once the sprouts were ready, I tossed them in a bowl with the sauce and sprinkled a little bit more black pepper on for texture/appearance.

Sorry in advance for the lack of process pictures, lack of recipe and poor picture quality. I decided to just throw this together but it turned out really nicely and I thought you guys might enjoy it! Any suggestions are welcome, of course, always looking to improve my dishes. One thing I considered was frying some bacon in the pan before carmelizing the veggies, which is what I do when I cook kale.

I ordered what was called ""hot and spice chicken [sic]"" (左宗鸡 [Xiāng là jī], from their menu), and it was easily my favorite. It had small chunks of chicken fried until extremely crispy with quartered chili peppers, garlic, and scallions. They also had dumplings called ""Chengdu dumplings"" (成都水饺 [Chéngdū shuǐjiǎo], also from menu), which were half-moon shaped beef or pork dumplings in a soy-based sauce (probably soy sauce, chili oil, and garlic from what it tasted like), and dan-dan noodles (四川担担面 [Sìchuān dàndàn miàn], from menu), which were regular egg noodles in a soy-based sauce with minced pork, scallions, and ground peanuts on top. Everything was just so good, I want to see if I can make some of it at home. I think I'd be just as happy to only have the dumplings if I can.

Anyways, all this to say: does anybody here have recipes for any of these things? Perhaps ones passed down through family or friends?

It's a traditional kind of sauce that uses roasted peppers, onions, cilantro, garlic and sea salt.  We use whole roasted peppers and only fresh ingredients so the taste is really what sets us apart instead of the heat (obviously I'm a bit biased, but seriously, we always get really good reactions when out doing taste test demos at the stores we're in). 

You can check out our website [redhotrobothotsauce.com](http://redhotrobothotsauce.com/) or feel free to ask me anything. Oh yeah, and I definitely don't want this to come across as some sort of crass solicitation. Just figured I'd share my excitement with some like minded folks. :)

I wish I had a picture, but I don't.. just thought I'd post the recipe here in case I forget it, or can't find it again (I've only seen this recipe on yahoo answers...). This stuff has some serious flavor with some serious heat. Grab some pita bread and use it as a dipping sauce!

**Mango Jolokia Sauce**

* 1 Tbls. olive oil
* 4 mangoes - peeled, cored, diced
* 1 small onion - chopped
* 1 dried Bhut Jolokia chili pepper pod - whole, stem removed
* 1/4 cup lemon or lime juice
* 2 Tbls. tomato paste OR 1/4 cup ketchup
* 1/4 cup sugar
* salt and pepper to taste

Directions:

* Heat oil in a 2-quart saucepan. Add mangoes, onion and Jolokia pod. Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, until onions are soft and translucent.
* Add lemon/lime juice, tomato paste/ketchup, and sugar. Simmer, stirring often, for 30 minutes.
* Remove pan from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
* Pour mixture into a blender and puree until smooth.
* Season with salt and pepper.
* Chill until ready to serve.

Today, I was forced into a spicy chili cookoff in 2 weeks for work.  I looked online and can find some dried varieties of ghost peppers, but I can't find anything fresh.  Does anyone know of any place online that will sell fresh ghost peppers?  Does anyone happen to have one or two they will send me?

1315530174.0	k9hj5	I just finished three Naga Jolokia tacos	rrearleii	33	8	38	"Don Pedro's Taqueria in Winooski, VT has ""El Diablo Taco Challenge"". FOr $10, you have 15 minutes to eat three Naga jolokia-laden tacos with no beverage until after the 15 minutes are up. They give you a gallon of milk after that 15 minutes. 

I finished 5 minutes early and had to wait for the remaining time for the timer to run out. The milk they gave me was 2%, which I have never been able to drink (because it's like cream), so I had a sip and decided that it wouldn't do any good.

I took a picture of the tacos with my phone before I started, but it didn't save, which I found out when I went to put it on imgur just now. All they had on them was a spoonful of pico de gallo and a bit of lettuce.

Overall, I think that they could have been spicier. I expected them to be worse, and 45 minutes after finishing, I can barely feel it in my mouth anymore. It's my stomach that feels the worst. By far the worst part of it was getting hiccups after the first bite. They went away after the second taco.

They claimed that it was 100 habaneros and 1 tomato (100 + 1 + ""101"") I don't think they meant it, as I know I tasted onions and other basic ingredients. However, it was awesome and delicious. Knowing my own habaneros were now ripe, I tried to make my own version. I had a dozen people taste it and every one of them was really happy with it (and now it is gone!)

Here's my recipe, based on what was ripe in my garden:

6 habaneros

4 jalapenos

1/2 of white onion

1 clove of garlic

1 roma tomato

a pinch of salt

a splash of cider vinegar.

Blend to your preference.

1368965988.0	1emlga	Chicken is for Jerks (Jerk Chicken Chilli)	mikesk3tch	30	7	2	"Hey /r/spicy here's a little something I cooked up this weekend. A really easy recipe for a tasty and fiery dish.

**Cooking the beast:**
Having spent an outrageous amount of money on Jerk Chicken from the takeaways in Shepherd's Bush lately I decided to have a go. As I often use a slow cooker to make a weeks worth of food at a time it's worth mentioning that I did not go for a traditional Jerk Chicken dish. What I actually did was take the flavours from Jerk Chicken and turn it into a curry/chilli style dish.
Playing on the sweet afterburn of a Scotch Bonnet I opted to use celeriac and pineapple as my ""vegetables"" (half of a large one of each) along with one and a half onions and a kilo of chicken breast.
Having not cooked Jerk Chicken before I cheated somewhat and picked up an off the shelf marinade by Dunns River. A quarter of a teaspoon taster of this showed it to be quite fiery with a good amount of flavour as one would expect from a Jerk sauce. I coated the chicken liberally in the sauce and left for 8 hours during which time I diced the pineapple and celeriac, chopped the onions etc. After a while I gave the chicken a quick grilling and chopped it up ready to go into the slow cooker with the veg. One the pot was loaded up with bird and veg I started adding some of the flavours I wanted to bring out of the jerk sauce so grated a good amount of ginger, 3 chopped dried scotch bonnets (I like it hot - maybe tone it down) and 4 cloves of garlic (probably not traditional but meh). Chuck in a few tins of chopped tomatoes and a chunk more of the Dunns marinade and slow cook way down low for as long as possible (managed to leave mine for 14 hours).

**Ingredients:**
1kg Chicken Breast
1 and 1/2 small onions
2 tins Chopped Tomatoes
1/2 Jar Dunn's River Jerk Marinade
3x Dried Scotch Bonnet peppers
1/2 Celeriac
1/2 Pineapple

**The taste:**
Whew! The burn is a slow builder. First bite seems like no problem, fiery but totally eatable so you get stuck in. The first thing I noticed was fire rising up the back of my throat to my nostrils and my eyelids sweating. Good times. All of the chicken has turned so soft you barely need to chew it. The spice level seems to be consistent with the sauce which is reasonably thick due to the now pulverised celeriac. As you chow down it continues to build layer upon layer of heat slowly but surely. By the time I was done with a single bowl my entire body was sweating but due to the sweetness offset from the pineapple it seemed palatable all the way through. It's worth mentioning that Pineapple seems to store capsicum like a champ. Those chunks are HOT! After eating I had a very strong tingling around my lips and tongue for a good half an hour. All in I'd say a pretty heroic chilli with plenty of flavour so it's not just fire for the sake of it. Very pleased. "	t5_2s1qd	True

1331736628.0	qw7u2	So tonight will be my first attempt at making my own ghost pepper hot sauce...	dickscraper	21	0	20	"...and I'm looking for a little advice. I recently picked up an ounce of dried ghost peppers. I have about a quarter pound of habaneros on hand, and all the other ingredients that seem to be standard when I google recipes (vinegar, garlic, cumin, etc... but no onion... I hate onions). On the first try I was thinking about using 2 ghost peppers and maybe 4-5 habaneros.

My plan is to blend all the ingredients together, then bring to a boil and let simmer for 15 minutes, refrigerate, then sample when cooled.

Is there anything I should keep in mind? Any fun additional ingredients I can add? Any advice is appreciated!

UPDATE:

It turned out great. I used ghost peppers, habaneros, vinegar, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, a little bit of vegetable oil, and about a quarter cup of Zombie Dust (IPA). It was pretty damn spicy but not so much so that it was only hot that you could taste. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out, if I may say so. As for the goggles/respirator/gloves... I wore goggles but really they just made things harder, so I ended up placing them on my forehead most of the time. I couldn't find a respirator on short notice so I got a surgical mask from walgreens and wrapped a bandanna around it. That worked well I think, since I didn't have any breathing problems at all. I didn't double up on gloves, just stuck with the single layer, and made sure to wash my hands vigorously afterward, and everything turned out fine. Thanks for all your help.

* 250g hacked almonds
* 300g hacked dark chocolate (70%+, the darker the better)
* 250g rolled oats
* 100g powdered cocoa beans
* 3 eggs
* 1.5 small spoons baking soda
* 2.5 small spoons salt
* A little vanilla extract according to your taste or, even better real vanilla 

* Be carefull, the stuff is hot!
* Cut habaneros and blend them with sugar into a very smooth paste (for a hotter product you can use the seeds as well, otherwise remove them)
* Mix butter very well with habanero-sugar paste, egg, salt and vanilla
* Put baking soda into the flour and stir thoroughly in a separate  container
* Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly, add the coarsely cut chocolate at the very end, mix it in
* Set oven temperature to 180°C
* Put small amounts of the dough mix on bakery release paper (size according to your taste. Remember they will increase in size during the baking process), placed on a sheet pan
* Bake for about 15-18 minutes (you can use a wooden toothpick to check if the cookies are done. Stick it into the cookies, if there is still dough on it when you remove it, it is not done, add a few minutes)

Overall this will take you about 30 minutes, adjust the ingredients to your needs (eg divide the given amounts by 2). You can switch the hacked almonds with baking marzipan or peanuts if you like.

OneFishTwoFish	20	2	2	"I love [CaJohn's Mustard 10](https://www.cajohns.com/store/CaJohns-Jolokia-Mustard).  It's got an intense heat and flavor that's great on brats, hot dogs, breakfast sandwiches, and just about everything else.  


As I was scraping the last bit of mustard out of my last jar with a pretzel stick, I noticed that the ingredients list is basically the recipe:


&gt; Ingredients: Premium prepared mustard, red habaneros, Bhut Jolokia chiles.  


I felt like the little girl in the Jurassic Park movie, *""This is Unix!  I know this!""*  So I picked a few peppers, grabbed the food processor and a squeeze bottle of French's Mustard from the pantry and set to work.  


**Recipe (makes 8 ounces)**  

* 0.5 to 1 Ghost / Bhut Jolokia pepper
* 1 to 2 Habanero peppers
* 8 ounces of prepared mustard  


**Process**


* Cut the stems off the peppers and cut them in halves or quarters.
* (Optional) Remove seeds and pith (I didn't).
* Puree the peppers in a food processor to medium-fine.  Mine has a mini-bowl, which made working with such a small quantity easier.
* Add the mustard and puree until thoroughly mixed.  
* Spoon the mustard back into the jar (a funnel helps).  


That's it.  The results were spot-on with the real CaJohn's mustard and it's even better after a day or two.  I'm looking forward to experiments with different mustards and peppers.


The vinegar and the natural anti-bacterial properties of mustard should keep the peppers fresh, especially in the refrigerator.   The folks in [/r/canning](http://www.reddit.com/r/canning) could probably say for sure, but this batch won't last long enough for that to be a concern.  "	t5_2s1qd	True

Sorry if this is well-known already, but this is my first time posting here and I couldn't find many references to them through the search. 

Poblanos are large, similar to a green bell but longer. For the most part they kind of taste like a bell too, but with just a touch of hot (sometimes barely enough to notice), but they also have this unpredictable quality where they will occasionally be substantially hotter than others from the same plant; so, eating them is like playing Russian roulette with capsicum, lol. The hot ones are usually no worse then than a mild jalapeno (estimated [3k Scoville](http://tasteoftx.com/recipes/chiles/poblano.html)).

They're used a lot in Tex-Mex/Mexican cooking, most often you can find them as a _[chile relleno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno)_. Some of the peppers get really large, and so you can pack quite a bit of stuffing in them if you go that route. And at home I use them anytime a recipe calls for a green bell, and last night I used one in a meatloaf and it turned out great.

Anyone else cook with poblanos?"	t5_2s1qd	True

I just ate a lot of Pepper Palace's Jolokia Ketchup. Wow, that was hot. Much hotter than Melinda's Red Savina hot sauce. I dunked a chicken nugget in some of the ketchup and took a big bite. The heat comes on pretty quick. And it's hot. I ate about 3 or 4 nuggets (or about 2 tablespoons of ketchup) about 5mins ago. Mouth is still on fire, yet my head feels cold (i think from sweating) and kinda like it's swimming. Kinda euphoric. It definitely woke up me up some.

Which was awesome for me because he was able to really send me some great stuff that will be put to good use:

1. Sauce: Bottle of Holy Jolokia
2. Sauce: Bottle of Secret Aardvark Habanero Sauce
3. Book: ""Hot Sauce! Techniques for making Signature Hot Sauces""
4. Book: ""The Complete Chile Pepper Book""
5. Seeds: Trinidad 7-Pot Yellow Pepper
6. Seeds: Trinidad Scorpion
7. Seeds: Jamaican Yellow Scotch Bonnet

[All Pictured Here](http://i.imgur.com/DLmww.jpg)

The Holy Jolokia I've been using sparingly because it really packs a punch. It's got a great flavor to it and doesn't take much to heat things up.The Aardvark sauce is amazing, I'm half-way through the bottle so far. It has a good amount of heat with a tomato-base. It reminds me of Chana Masala without the garbanzo beans. I have yet to find something this sauce does not pair well with!

Since I had sent him a bottle of sauce made from peppers I had grown, he incorporated that into the rest of the stuff he sent. A bunch of seeds to grow for the next season and two great books on how to fine-tune my ""production process"". I cannot wait to begin growing new plants from the seeds he sent, and I've already got a few sauces picked out from the books that I'm truly looking forward to making.

Thanks so much.

EDIT: Just wanted to give a quick update. First off, thanks for all of the interest, it should be a great exchange. Next, there has been some concern about the quality of the exchange. While there is no price limit, I strongly urge everyone to do their best to not send generic, easily accessible sauces such as Tabasco, Cholula, Sirracha, etc. Lastly, I am making the matches this morning and should have the info to everyone at some point this afternoon e.s.t.

With everyone's help, this is going to be great!!
Thanks so much 

EDIT 2: All the matches have been sent out.

EDIT 3: A lot of people are starting to get their packages, please post your haul. If you haven't yet, make sure to send out your packages by the end of the week!!

I jumped on it, since it didn't have extract in it, which from my experience, tastes bad. 

This sauce is AMAZING, It starts off with a real sharp pepper bite which is really nice. The heat is imo perfect, it's hot enough that you know you're eating a ghost pepper sauce, but not too hot (if thats even possible). The flavor reminds me a bit of the red el yucateco habanero sauce, which is interesting since there are no habaneros in the ingredients. 

Honestly one of the best sauces that I've had.

9/10 it could be a bit hotter, but its good for what it is.

1306264601.0	hj4q1	My favorite hot sauce recipe, own creation. 	adelie42	20	3	13	"I have always loved spicy food and once I discovered the habanero pepper, I was in love. The hot and sweet is a great combination, and I always use the seeds and pith. I was originally working on a base for cioppino, and it took awhile to find the perfect combination of flavors that would also dissolve well. I like HOT, so sure it could be adjusted to taste.

1 delicious pear, cubed and cored
2 golden plums, remove seed
1 large lemon, quartered
1 lb peeled garlic
1.5 lbs habanero peppers
1 tbsp salt
lemon juice

Combine ingredients in blender and puree until homogenized (3-4 minutes). If it is too think to blend, try stirring with the unit off, and reblend. If it still won't mix, add a tablespoon of lemon juice at a time does. It should look like and have the consistency of a smoothie.

Once homogenized, pour into a Pyrex dish. Warning: Do NOT use metal or ceramic unless you want all future food cooked in that dish to come out spicy. Bake at 300 F° for 8-10 hours to dehydrate. Stir every hour or two to keep surface from burning. It is done when it is a dark caramel color and will hold a shape (like paste, but not sticky).

Make about 1qt. Refrigerates well up to 1 year.

---

For the cioppino I mixed two tbsp paste with a stick of melted butter. Bake until done and add cooked fish to water. No need to add anything else.

1 part paste with 1 part cream cheese on a tortilla and generous amounts of shredded chedder cheese and toasted with butter for an awesome casadia. Also goes well with shredded beef, chicken, pork.

One of my all time favorite creations was hot sauce with butter, feta cheese, and bacon, spread on homemade sour loaf, topped with minced grilled beef tenderloin (cooked in the bacon fat obviously), roasted garlic, parmesan, and sharp white cheddar. Broiled till brown.

1tsp to a bowl of ramen for a bit of a kick.

Oddly enough, enhances chocolate well. 1-2 tsp to a batch of brownies. A dash to some hot coco is extra soothing, or to coffee for an extra pickup (drinking coffee with coconut syrup and hot sauce right now. Yum!).

If you are a real heat freak, delicious simply spread on saltines and enjoy.

My favorite things about this hot sauce are that it keeps me from having to handle hot peppers every time I want to add some flavor to a dish, doesn't necessarily require anything but water for a good soup base, and yet goes well with sweet and savory... everything.

I did a ghost pepper pod test with a friend of mine around 7pm, then went out - had a few beers, played some pool and came home around 10pm. Went to take a leak before heading to bed and a SURGE of pain shot through me. The capsaicin oil had managed to stay within the pores of my fingers and the pain I endured was incredible to say the least.

Just a reminder to all you chili-heads out there to make sure to either wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after handling peppers. The experience almost turned me off from peppers altogether until I reminded myself that it was simply a stupid mistake. 

Any of you spicy folks have any horror stories worth sharing?

* 1 Habañero pepper
* 6 Tomatillos
* 1 White onion
* 1 Roma tomato
* 3 Garlic cloves

* 1 Lime
* Sea Salt
* Olive oil

If you are weak:

* Cream cheese

Wash the jalapeños &amp; habañero and coat with olive oil &amp; sea salt. Roast in the oven at 450 until the skin blackens and pulls away from the fruit. Allow to cool, peel &amp; de-stem. Remove seeds if you wish the salsa to be less hot. 

Peel, wash, and core the tomatillos. Put in a pot, cover halfway with water, and boil until soft. Drain.

Cut the ends off the onion, cut in half, peel, and quarter. 

Cut the end off the tomato and slice it.

Crush, peel, and cut the end off the garlic. 

Cut off the leafy end of the bunch of cilantro. Discard the stems. 

Juice the lime.

Place all ingredients in a blender, with sea salt to taste. Blend smooth. 

For those without a bulge in their pants, add cream cheese and blend to the desired heat level, or just serve the salsa over cream cheese.

1351427337.0	127szl	How to make red chicken enchiladas	TheKingOfPoon	19	4	6	"Just made these and they were pretty much perfect, so I thought I would share.

Ingredients:

4 chicken breasts

2 small white onions

5 cloves of garlic

tablespoon chicken bouillon

teaspoon marjoram

teaspoon thyme

salt

pepper

3 large plum type tomatoes

3 bay leaves

coriander (seed)

dried red chiles (guajillo, ancho, New Mexico, puya, etc.)

1 Trinidad Scorpion

5 chiltepins

cumin

oregano

sugar

butter or lard

oil

corn tortillas


I started by poaching the chicken.  Bone-in skin-on chicken would be preferable but all I had was boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I put 4 chicken breasts in a pot, filled with water until it was a few inches over the top, then added a small quartered onion, 2 cloves of garlic cut in half, about a teaspoon of Knorr's Caldo con Sabor De Pollo (basically chicken bouillon), about a teaspoon of marjoram, a teaspoon of thyme, some salt and pepper, a few bay leaves, and some roasted coriander.  Once it was done poaching I turned the heat off to let it slowly cool so that it stayed moist and tender.  Then I pulled the bay leaves out and discarded, [pulled the chicken out and shredded it using my fingers, then lightly salted it.](http://i.imgur.com/JgbKi.jpg)


The liquid and everything from the pot used to flavor the chicken is now basically flavored chicken stock which is used to make the enchilada sauce.

Next up is the most important part, the dried chiles. 

[I used about 6 guallijo, 6 New Mexico, and 3 Ancho.](http://i.imgur.com/dG6Fm.jpg)


Tear the dried chiles into pieces, discard the stems and seeds, and then toast them briefly in a dry pan until they become aromatic (don't burn them!).  Then add them to the liquid, along with a fresh Trinidad Scorpion cut in half, and about 5 chiltepins cut in half.

[Next, sauté a few more cloves of garlic and another small onion in butter until they're browned, and add them to the pot.  Dice about 3 large plum tomatoes and sauté them on med-high in butter (or lard) and add them to the pot along with the butter.](http://i.imgur.com/WuPPR.jpg)  Add more butter (or lard).


[Let it boil on med-high for about half an hour until the dried chiles become soft, then use an immersion blender if you have one, or transfer into a regular blender and purée.](http://i.imgur.com/IDpkz.jpg)  Add sugar and salt to taste.  I used probably 1 tbsp sugar.


If the sauce is a little thin, add some flour and/or simmer to reduce it.

Next, fry the corn tortillas in oil briefly, just to make them softer and more malleable.  Line the bottom of a glass or ceramic pan with some of the sauce, place some of the chicken in the corn tortillas, role the tortilla around the chicken, and [place them seam side down in the pan.](http://i.imgur.com/hKZmu.jpg)


Pour more sauce over them, place foil over the top, and then pop them in an oven heated to about 350F for about 20 minutes.

Take them out, plate them, and top with queso fresco, some Mexican sour cream, or whatever tickles your fancy.  [The finished product](http://i.imgur.com/JcKPi.jpg)

1342515565.0	woz91	Ghost Pepper Vindaloo	everybodyhatesclowns	18	3	3	"[This](http://i.imgur.com/qZ36B.jpg) is what we had yesterday. I'm still in slight pain as I'm writing this.

The recipe can be found here: http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-vindaloo-10000000521974/

Our changes where:

* use 4 dried Ghost Peppers (seeds included) instead of their's.
* use a bit more cloves
* use something [real](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/uij77/what_to_do_with_duck_stock/) instead of the broth.

To get the chiles pulverized, we immersed them in some stock and mixed them thoroughly.

All in all, it was insanely hot, but also incredible delicious. Unbelievable chile high.

It's a really simple dish that is ideal to deliver crazy heat. I think it might be even better than [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/uii11/penne_allarrabiata_with_shrimps_and_bhut_jolokia/).
Although: all'arrabiata is perfect for Habaneros (and they still taste the best, imho), Vindaloo not so much.

Sealed bags seem to contain somewhat moist hot fries, and even when they aren't moist, they're way too crunchy and bland compared to how they were before, as if they were stale. This isn't just my local store or any one shipment, either -- bags from over an hour away are also suffering from this, and it's been going on long enough that it can't just be one bad batch.

If it could have something to do with location, these bags were taken primarily from the Latrobe, PA area, and the ""one hour away"" bags were taken from Pittsburgh, PA.

Anyone else noticing this problem, or is this the only area affected?


Edit: Received a reply to an email that was sent to customer service. They seemed genuinely concerned about the recent quality of the Hot Fries. They assured me that there was no recipe change. Perhaps wait another month and see if these bad batches phase out? Anyway, yay good Hot Fries coming back!"	t5_2s1qd	True

[http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dvoqk/cookit_i_made_hot_sauce_from_my_own_peppers_for/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dvoqk/cookit_i_made_hot_sauce_from_my_own_peppers_for)

Well it's been about a month since I canned my first hot sauce from my own peppers so last night I decided to have a ""Wing Ding"" at my friends place to try it out.

I made about 75 wings (doing the Alton Brown steam n' bake) and made up Hot &amp; Butter sauces (1 stick of butter to 2 jars of sauce) from my red and green sauces, and also a General Tao sauce for balance. We had caesar salad and garlic bread as well.

The sauce was a smash hit! Everyone loved the red sauce the best and throughout the end of the meal were even dipping garlic bread into the extra sauce to eat it. The red's spicy level was perfect, somewhere in between Frank's Red Hot and Frank's Red Hot Extra Hot (or Durkee's Hotter than Hot). Nice flavour and heat, not too much of either! Everyone had a nice endorphin rush!

The green was quite a different flavour from the garlic added to it but was unique enough to stand on it's own (and one person picked it as their favourite).

I will definitely be doing this again next year!

Second, I did not know that this pepper was still on record as the most piquant. I know that the Moruga Scorpion was tested as being hotter but that test has yet to be duplicated for records.

My initial reaction to the sample was surprise. When placed on my tongue I felt no immediate heat. The heat was only activated when my saliva touched the pepper. Once this happened the door was open. The primary flavor I was able to discern was smokey. If I had been told that this pepper was smoked before hand I would have believed it. The Scorpion could give a good Isle Scotch a run for it's money. I was shocked to find that where the pepper made contact with my tongue, there was a chill effect. As in my tongue felt cold. I supposed this can be explained as a numbing effect as well. Other flavors I detected included nutty, and a very light sweetness.
This pepper would make a great addition to any salsa or bbq dishes.

TL;DR:
I tried a pepper that has been rated at 1.4 million Scoville units. Intensely smokey flavor, with nutty and sweet hints. Reminded me of Scotch."	t5_2s1qd	True

Omnishinzui	16	2	7	"Ive looked at different past threads on /r/cooking and on cooking sites but I cant come up with an answer. Basically I make a lot of rice to go on the side of my meals (usually chicken breast). However no matter if its jasmine or brown rice in the rice cooker it just is always perfectly cooked and the same. No matter the spices I add, it usually is either bland as hell or too potent (especially from cumin). 

I love those boxes of rice I buy from the store, like theres one (forget brand) thats Mexican rice and I just add a can of diced tomato and its out of this world delicious. I just add a bit of spice to it like with cayenne or using rotel instead of normal diced tomato. Not sure the spices in the box of rice though. Thats using a pan tho not a rice cooker.

Id like to find a way to make my own, via pan or rice cooker (guessing the high heat and browing of rice before adding water is the main difference between the two). Bulk rice is so cheap and lasts forever while those boxes can cost $1-2 for 4 meals. I got a lot of spices, some being from back when i was doing a lot of curry recipes (got like tumeric, coriander, etc). Id add probably some veggies like onion, bell pepper, serrano pepper,  and other stuff into the rice as well.

Started with about a quarter near the stem. About five minutes later I ate the bottom quarter from that side. It was hot, but I wasn't dying.

About 15 minutes later I ate the other half. Give me props. No milk or dairy products in the house in case it became unbearable!

I really don't want to come off as a douche here, but after eating a bunch of Bhut Jolokia's I've grown over the past year or so, I really don't see what the big deal is... 

They're hot, but it's a good kind of hot with a nice body sweat and a great endorphin buzz... You guys know:  Snot coming out of the nose, sweat, watery eyes... The good stuff! :)

I wouldn't want to cook with 'em a lot because I think the heat could easily overpower the flavor of the food - which I like. 

But as far as the heat goes, I believe that after you get to a certain heat level and get comfortable with it, another 200k Scoville Unites doesn't matter that much.. 

What do you guys think?"	t5_2s1qd	True
