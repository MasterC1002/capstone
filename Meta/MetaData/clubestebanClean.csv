1364907269.0	1bifxy	The beauty about estebans adventures	Ballminator	53	5	22	"What really  got me hooked on these videoes is that he doesnt directly troll the people. He always seems to connect with them on their own level depending on their mood. Its always about asking strange but acceptable questions, and if they respond in a 'positive' way he can go a little deeper. But it wouldnt be funny at all if it was all about: ""fuck you losers why are you wasting your life in this game"". Thats just too easy, and not really fun.
They all have like perfect characters in the game, and when Esteban explore all these kind of people with his rather ""unique"" looking character, it just hits me spot on everytime. I dont think he ever insulted anyone in his videos. The only video where it got a little rough is with that juggalo guy. But yet again, its about connecting with their mood and when he at the same time has a weird looking character, it reflects on the people he interacts with IMO. Its like a clown in a circus joking with people, we all think it is okay because the clown looks funny.

I have done some interaction myself now for a almost a week and it is hard to find people to talk to. I wouldnt call it trolling, more like exploring what people love so much about this game. Most people have their bullshit sensor on right away if you ask them a simple question.

I just wanted to share my experiences and why i like what esteban has created.

MrGingee	34	1	24	"My opinion on the event that occurred today may seem a little different to most others, I understand that a joke on the Sub Reddit and on Charlies YouTube is to re phrase what Jesse, Esteban and Chargglez say. But I feel that the Fan base takes it to a whole new level of spaghetti when in the game, Instead of being inspired by such acts, They instead carry on rephrasing such lines as ""HELLO"". 

I wasn't In Korea 2 or w.e But I was a strange Island with some people who couldn't attend the event and they were their the whole time complaining that they couldn't get in (Which is why streaming was offered) and a couple of there idea's were ""Lets raid by ourselves"", ""Does anyone have contact with Esteban"". The only person there who was willing to attempt to communicate was a guy named 2 Girls 1 Cub, Who wondered the tiny beach starting conversations half-way through. 

TL;DR I think people should think of there own Persona's for SL Trolling Characters rather than basically joining a raid and trying to be funny doing somebody else's lines."	t5_2waqg	True

Young people take Esteban seriously because he cares more about being honest than being paid. There are so many dusty corners and layers to the second life persona and world. He has created a labyrinth of spontaneous creativity. His entire ""club Esteban"" movement is founded on channeling his unconscious thoughts instantaneously. His production is forward-thinking, diverse, and the reflection of his personal taste. The videos become way less about trolling and much more about his philosophy/approach to being an everyday average man with bad genes. He's not parodying second life players; he's reinventing second life for his personality. This is something that only true artists can do regardless of what genre they work in. I am not a mod, nor do I know charlie/Esteban or jesse personally, but I do know for a fact, that they will always be in my heart. Esteban forever."	t5_2waqg	True

If she doesn't feel like selling it maybe we could open up a REAL club esteban.

I see that a lot of people on the internet use crowdfunding sites like indiegogo to get money for projects, so I was thinking we could make Club Esteban a reality seeing as his popularity is increasing and there's not much money to raise.
