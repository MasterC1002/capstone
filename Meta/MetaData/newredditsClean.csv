He is interviewing people that give him rides, those he stays with, and people he meets in the streets.  It's a beyond amazing look into the actual, no-political-bullshit state of our country.

Case and point.  The most recent episode (6) he speaks with a 19 year old who is pregnant and living on the streets in Nashville.  And she's probably one of the most inspiring kids I've ever heard talk.  I think it's a tribute to our generation's mentality.  ""Shit's fucked up, ok.  Now how do we fix it?""

Anyways, he's a great guy.  Very upbeat, very chill.  And I think his project needs a hell of a lot more attention.

Click the ""Subreddit Tags"" shortcut on the top to see the list of Tags.  Right now there are very few, because tagging hasn't really begun.  

To help out and tag, either click the tag links to add or remove subreddits to them - OR - goto a subreddit's bio and add/remove tags from there.

I also added something which could be interesting which is a reddit multi which is created on every tag page, so you can easily view all the subreddits of similar nature at the same time.

Please help out by tagging stuff, if enough people do it we can finally develop an organized map of what subreddits are out there.

Oh, and don't forget to click the ads :D

*edit: please don't add a tag unless there are other subreddits which match the same tag.  There's no point in having a tag which only matches one subreddit *

*edit: Alright, the tags are already starting to take off.  BTW, please don't create a tag which only applies to one subreddit.  The point of tags is to group related subreddits, having a tag with only one subreddit is pointless.*"	t5_2qh7x	True

Instead of posting a self-post talking about a subreddit and trying to explain why it's great, why not just post to the comments page of a popular post within your subreddit, as a link? That sends the user straight to that subreddit to see for themselves an example of why it's so great, along with a handy ""subscribe"" showing on the right. Then title the post ""[Name of Original Post] (from [Name of Subreddit])"".

Because if I see ""r/poems"" on my front page, I may not click that, but if I see an intriguing title of a poem with (from r/poems) in the title, I may be drawn in by that.

The point is to ask other Redditors (who may have experienced something most other Redditors haven't) how those experiences feel/felt. It might sounds silly but read on.

Example Questions:

1) How does it feel to have synthesia?

2) How does it feel to skydive?

3) How does it feel to do heroin?

4) How does it feel to have a seizure?

5) How does it feel to be mega wealthy/extremely poor?

The possibilities are endless and I bet there are very interesting insights that could be uncovered here.

Important Note: I know this sounds similar to /r/IAMA but unlike /r/IAMA, the answers are not just based around one person's experiences but works like a collective back and forth where questions can be answered by anybody in the community willing to share their story.

On my ride to work one morning I started thinking about the holidays, and began trying to figure out what type of gift I should get my father, a retired engineer and avid outdoorsmen. 

I know what his interests are in a broad sense, but that unfortunately does not get me too far when I cluelessly wander into an outdoor store. Because of this, I caught myself thinking *there should be a Reddit community I can ask about this.*

So here it is. I hope it catches on. If you need the Reddit community's help finding a gift for someone, try posting here. I imagine a successful post will include some basic information about the person you're shopping for (their age and hobbies, for example), along with your price range, kind of like this:

&gt; What is the perfect gift for a road cyclist in their early 20's? Price range $30 - $50usd. 

Good luck, and thanks!

Still might be a few bugs I haven't caught yet, so lemme know if you find any so I can fix them.

Well, this is me finally doing that.

Anyway, things to check out that are new since the last time you (probably?) saw it.  You can now view what reddits are fastest rising and falling from the main page.  You can now view subreddit bios complete with trend info [pretty cool stuff if you want to track your favorite subreddit to see how it did this week], just click the ""info"" link next to the subreddit to see it.  You can now find subreddits with ""more than X"" subscribers instead of just less than.

Well, I decided to go one step further and spreadsheet the data received and compare it from two weeks ago and today [to see which subreddits have moved up and which have moved down]

[Click here to see what subs are rising &amp; falling](https://spreadsheets.google.com/lv?key=tzFu8IuMwt4C8KTO4Qc2emQ&amp;type=view&amp;gid=0&amp;f=true&amp;sortcolid=-1&amp;sortasc=true&amp;rowsperpage=1250)

I compared Activity Rank and Subs Rank, and created a Composite Rank [in green].  The tables are sortable by clicking the column names.  Activity Rank is based on what order reddit puts them in.  Subs Rank is based on how many subs it has.

*Note: Data is incomplete.  Because Reddit has so many damn subreddits, my program only gets info from the most active 1250.  On some of these, a subreddit is in the top 1250 that wasn't two weeks ago: on these the old activity rank is assumed at #1250 and the subs rank is assumed to be unchanged.*

lemme know what you think

User17	68	16	7	"Following the hilarious ""[Project Googly Mayhem](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/noori/i_call_it_project_googly_mayhem/)"" post in /r/funny. I discovered eyebombing, and would love to see a subreddit dedicated to it.

The basic principle of eyebombing:
&gt;Eyebombing is the act of setting googly eyes on inanimate things in the public space.

&gt;Ultimately the goal is to humanize the streets, and bring sunshine to people passing by.

&gt;THE RULES:

&gt;1. Only images of inanimate objects with wiggle eyes - NOT stickers.

&gt;2. Only images taken in the public space.

1269695714.0	bizn6	Reddit: I think it's about time that we have this sub/r/. As I browse many self posts, it seems that so many people are out of steam, bored with life, confused, and generally lacking motivation. For the better of the community, I created /r/GetMotivated. 		58	11	11	"[/r/GetMotivated](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/)



So many people lately seem to be just, I dunno...lost. Or bored. Or putting off everything they want to do. 

Here's a few I just nabbed off the front page of AskReddit:

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/biyzr/hey_exsmokers_how_did_you_stop/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/biw7q/im_a_19_year_old_college_student_going_through/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bisww/redditors_its_official_ive_hit_rock_bottom/).

Here's a few from the front page of /r/Self:

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/biswe/i_know_that_as_soon_as_i_get_out_of_bed_i_have_to/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bigj2/in_a_rut/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bfj6u/apparently_im_unemployable/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bfq0i/how_i_feel_about_everything_in_my_life_it_will_be/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bf6d5/reddit_do_i_drink_too_much/).

Is that enough?

I think it's time for an /r/ like this.

I started it off with about a half-dozen links. If you like what you see, help me get the word out and we can help our fellow Redditors make their lives a little bit better. 

Or, if this is just lame, let me know. Just tell me either way.

Right now people mainly post news articles rather than the actual article. I think we could use http://www.scribd.com/ to share pdfs, or if that is somehow illegal, we could post the abstracts and/or our own reviews. We could do this for any field, and possible have separate subreddits by field. I think this would really help the academic community, and if we all worked together, we could share a whole lot of information.

1328122353.0	p6gm8	r/LifeChangers - if you could change another redditor's life with $1, would you?	solidwhetstone	54	15	7	"Subreddits like [/r/Assistance](/r/Assistance) and [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) have sprung up to help other redditors. These reddits have gained traction- but still only represent a pretty small % of total redditors. What if a lot of us- I mean a LOT of us banded together to make a difference?

I've come up with a subreddit idea that can only work if enough redditors are on board. It's called [r/LifeChangers](/r/lifechangers). Here's [a handy graphic](http://i.imgur.com/6X6H5.png) that explains the concept. (It's a little outdated now- so read further for clarification on some things)

The idea is this- none of us is as powerful as all of us. We proved that with SOPA when simply our upvotes got the admins talking seriously about a blackout. If 20,000 redditors subscribed to [/r/LifeChangers](/r/LifeChangers) and gave $1 each month to a deserving redditor (of the communities' choosing), we could change one life per month.

FAQs:

**What about scam artists?**

[/r/lifechangers](/r/lifechangers) will require a LOT of verification to the mods, and we have some proven moderators (as well as krispykrackers- an admin) on board that have a good track record doing this in [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) and other subreddits.

**What if some random person just comes onto reddit to ask for help?**

[/r/lifechangers](/r/lifechangers) will require that the person being helped has had a reddit account for over a year, is in good standing with the community, and has over 500 combined karma. This will make it far more likely that a redditor that deserves the help gets it.

**Holy shitballs I'm totally broke and about to get evicted!**

This isn't the service for that. Try out [/r/Assistance](/r/Assistance)  if you need immediate help- or if you need some food, try [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza). [/r/lifechangers](/r/lifechangers) is here to help redditors who have massive amounts of debt, medical bills, or other kids of life impeding debt against them that will seriously hurt their ability to move on with their life.

**What could go wrong?**

Well- it's possible that some things could- so that's why I'm hoping reddit likes this idea, comes and subscribes to the subreddit, and offers recommendations on how to make this core idea even more viable and foolproof. Nothing is perfect with benevolence. There will always be scam artists and people who will take advantage of others- so the goal would be to minimize that as much as possible (through rigorous verification by the community and mods).

**When does it get started?**

I don't think it makes sense to start until we get 1,000 subscribers. Then the first month (February if it happens fast- or March if it takes all month) will have its first recipient of money.

**What kind of money transfer service will be used**

Initially I was thinking paypal, but I've since learned that paypal will often charge a 0.33 fee on transactions even if they're just $1...so that pretty much doesn't make sense. So it'll really be up the community to decide on a preferred payment method.

**Put your money where your mouth is**

I absolutely will. Once we get this kicked off, I will give my $1 per month to the redditor the community votes on. It's 1 lousy dollar. What can I even buy with $1 anymore? If my $1 can change a redditor's life...well that's going to make me feel pretty damn good.
