1348426867.0	10coze	To reduce DUIs, my buddy and I are trying to put breathalyzer kiosks in Salt Lake bars. Where would you like to see one?	sah0605	110	22	69	"Hi there. My friend and I are working on a startup called, BreathAdvisor.

Most of us know that alcohol can impair peoples' judgement significantly.

We live in Salt Lake, and whenever we're out drinking at bars, we always hear, ""I'm good to drive."" This is rarely the case, and a ridiculous amount of people drive under the influence. We really, really hate drunk driving. Frankly, these people just don't know when they're too intoxicated to drive.

Our goal is to provide people with an accurate reading of their blood alcohol content (B.A.C.) and if needed, a safe option to get hoe.

From our mission statement, ""We will contribute to decreasing the amount of DUI related fatalities and protect patrons from the detrimental effects of receiving a DUI conviction.""

To do this, we've created the world's most accurate breathalyzer kiosk, featuring law-enforcement grade equipment. There are a few similar kiosks out there, but they are sold to bar owners at high costs, not maintained, and aren't very accurate... Our kiosk is accurate to +/- 0.005%, every time.

The kiosk would cost $2 for patrons to use, and they would get the $2 back in a discount on a cab ride if they requested a cab from the kiosk.

We plan on putting these kiosks in bars at no cost to the venue owner, and paying for the kiosks with the revenue. By doing this, we want bar owners to see no reason NOT to have a breathalyzer kiosk in their bar.

Any feedback would be awesome, and if you guys really like this idea, we can even do a Reddit promotion when we launch.

**Here's where I would like your advice:**

* Where would you like to see BreathAdvisor kiosks placed? I'm thinking in bars and clubs that most people drive to. Where would you use one?

* Would you use a kiosk if you had been drinking and were considering driving home? (We need 4 uses per night if we're installing them for free.)

* Would you be willing to use the kiosk if it were free? I think $2 is cheap, especially compared to a DUI or even a pint of your favorite Wasatch beer, but that's why I'm asking you.

* If you could throw us a ""Like"" on Facebook that would be pretty neat too, we're at www.facebook.com/BreathAdvisor and online at www.breathadvisor.com

* If you know bar owners in Salt Lake that might be interested in this, could you send them our way? We also have a 1-800 number.  (It's 1-800-594-2701)

*For our launch we'd love to do a bar crawl with fellow redditors, and of course, provide you all with ""3 for Free"" promotional cards to get the ball rolling. Let's make SLC a safer place to drink by reducing drunk driving! This could have awesome effects in future laws, for example, getting higher alcohol content beers in our favorite bars.

From Dec. 2012 to mid February 2013 I spent over a dozen hours hanging out on Rio Grande street adjacent to the Road Home shelter in downtown SLC. I spent a night at the shelter before the weather turned. Hanging out on the street I saw a fight, an overdose, numerous mentally ill individuals and an open-air drug market where most of the homeless are now hooked on ""spice"" the synthetic weed the Legislature supposedly banned.

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not usually done enjoying my cocktails until at least 1am, and cab fares from downtown into residential Davis County are a bit of a wallet-buster. I can't be the only one that doesn't have an anytime DD at their disposal; so it would be fabulous if UTA could follow the lead of other big cities and add late-night runs to their schedule for us grown-ups that would like to enjoy the liquid offerings of downtown but would prefer to save a little money by taking the train.	t5_2r7ac	True

Yeah, that place is being closed down by the School Board.  Can we please save this? 	demos74dx	80	12	17	"At it's height The Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center was teaching the wonders of space to over 16,000 students a year.  It's one of the ever lasting memories of my childhood education and I'd hate to see my future children miss out on the outstanding education and sense of wonder this simulator opened up in me.  

The center is asking for ""Likes"" on facebook to hopefully garner enough emotion out of the school board to keep it open, I don't know if this is going to work though.  Please follow the link [to facebook](
http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Christa-McAuliffe-Space-Education-Center/47795148889?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts) and like them.

I think we can do one better, please write down what you remember about this place and the education it's provided you. I'll start:

I was in 4th grade and I actually don't remember anything specific in school education from before 7th grade, except this simulation.  I remember being in the small simulator, the shuttle, which was 4-5 people.  I was in the back as a ""systems engineer(I think)"" and it was my job to replace blown out ""chips"" on a ""circuit board"" to ensure the survival of the ship.  I remember having to work as a team and communicate with my commander about the ships status and repairs.  It was tons of fun and I've always wished to go back and experience one of the 12+ man simulators.  Heck I'd gather up all my friends right now and pay a good chunk of change to go play in that big simulator.  Anyways this simulator gave me a pretty big interest in electronics and I took the first electronics class that was offered to me in High school, me and my friend went on to get 3rd in state at an electronics competition hosted by Utah Valley University.  I can say this field trip had one of the biggest and longest lasting impacts on my education.

A example message:

&gt;H.R.3261, the 'Stop Online Piracy Act', will dramatically harm and stifle free speech on the Internet. It would put the United States further behind in both freedom and technology, which is something we can ill afford at this point in our history. As a strong supporter of civil liberties and small government, this proposed law stands out to me as written for and by corporate interests. It will serve to stifle what should be protected forms of expression including some of the most popular and lucrative websites on the Internet; sites like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
&gt;Please don't let this bill become law. This country needs more innovation, not more stagnation.

Like splice in Tom n Jerry clips etc or have some funny crowd participation moment, with full permission from the studio/director of course. We would rally local groups interested in supporting Brewvies and reasonable liquor legislation etc. The movie would be free with the option to donate to the cause.

For all of you that don't know, it is a ticketable offense to park within **5 feet of any private driveway**.  I live up by the U, and that pretty much means that 75% of all the street parking is illegal.  Good times.


[And here's how I just paid the fine.](http://i.imgur.com/U67IV.jpg)

EDIT:  In case you're wondering why I didn't fight it - if found guilty (of the now $65 fine) ""a court imposed judgment filing fee of $60.00 will be added to the court case.  A judge may also impose attorney fees up to $75.00 and a collection fee of $45.00  A judgment will appear on your credit rating for 8 years"" (that brings the total to $245 for a fucking parking ticket!)

 and

 ""If your complaint is regarding a problem with the way the area is marked, whether or not you feel the ordinance is valid and should be changed, why other vehicles in the area were not cited when you were, or how you were treated by the officer, the courtroom is not the proper place for those types of complaints and will not be addressed by the judge.

AgedAardvark	66	13	47	"I was involved in a musical performance at Abravanel Hall that happened to be taking place the same night as General Conference.  After the concert, I was going to take the Trax and meet up with some people.  Waiting on the platform next to Temple Square, in my tuxedo, surrounded by conference goers.  This older fellow apparently didn't realize that the universe doesn't stop for conference couldn't figure me out.  

""You're awful dressed up for Conference, aren't you?""

""I'm a musician, sir.""

""What, like, you're in a band?""

""Something like that.""

Now, I'd had a rough night on the stage, and this old fellow kind of irritated me, but I kept it together.  The train pulled up, and I climbed aboard.  I got off a few stops later, thinking I was in the right place, but I wasn't. I was one stop too soon.  So, there I am, walking down main street in the dark, in my tuxedo, going past the Wells Fargo building.  My tux shoes hurt, I've been jammed up against the faithful in the train, and I'm irritated as hell at myself for screwing up my stop.  

I notice, out of the corner of my eye, a long black limo moving South down main street.  Two young women are standing up in the sun roof.  I've seen Girls Gone Wild, so I had a hunch what was going on.  

""WOOOOO!"" I yelled.

One of the girls turned and looked at me.  ""There's one,"" she said.  With that, the two girls turned to me and lifted their shirts, exposing their boobs, and shook them around.  ""Hope you enjoyed Conference!"" one of the yelled.  

TL;DR:  Was having a horrible night, but got to see boobs because drunk chicks were trying to shock conference goers."	t5_2r7ac	True

I read quite a bit, mostly the classics and fantasy, and I cook religiously. I also knit and drink tea because I'm secretly an old lady. Drinking is a big part of my life, but no drunken escapades for me, I'd rather sit at home with some friends and gab the night away.

Would appreciate an explanation.	toinfinitiandbeyond	57	13	40	"EDIT3: The mystery has been solved!  My ex and her mother took their cars to be waxed at Super Sonic Car Wash.  We called Super Sonic in Orem and they confirmed that they do indeed put these little stickers on your license plate when you get your car waxed.  They also said that they've had no complaints about it.  I think they haven't had any complaints because people have no idea where these stickers came from.

I originally posted this in AskReddit but no one seems to have any idea what these stickers are for.

My ex-wife informed me about a strange thing that keeps happening to her and her family's cars. A strange little sticker keeps getting placed on their license plates. I've noticed other cars on the freeway with similar stickers as well.

She doesn't live in an apartment or park in any time limited lots.

Here's a photo of her mothers plate with a ""2"" sticker in between the numbers on her Utah License Plate.
Photo http://i.imgur.com/tefiI.jpg?1

I found another car in SLC that has similar stickers http://i.imgur.com/MwYtb.jpg

She claims she's contacted the DMV and they have no clue what the sticker is or where it could be from.

The little sticker gets placed in between the numbers on their plates.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could solve this mystery for her.

EDIT: One of my friends was at the DMV earlier today and they said that Super Sonic Car Wash might be putting them on but I can't imagine what the purpose of that would be.

EDIT2: The same friend that called the DMV called Super Sonic Car Wash and confirmed that they put a sticker like this on your plate when you have your car waxed.  With that being said I can't imagine my getting her car waxed because it is super oxidized and she's dirt poor.  I am, however, waiting for a response from her as to if she or her mother had their cars waxed."	t5_2r7ac	True

Can you help us catch the suspect?	wellsdb	51	8	27	"My friend Jake was brutally attacked at Maxwell's, a restaurant/bar in Salt Lake City, early this morning. He lost about 2.5 litres of blood, but is expected to make a full recovery. Jake has already racked up thousands of dollars in medical bills and currently doesn't have insurance.

Here is what he posted on Facebook:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Hey guys. i wanted to let you know i was assaulted last night and am now at the u of u hospital. I lost a lot of blood but im stable for now. The police are looking for the guy that did it so i am posting pictures online so people will help me find him.

The police are still actively looking for the guy who cheap shotted me with a glass. Apparently the bouncers at Maxwell helped him get away. I tried to find him but lost over 2 ltrs of blood in the process and have racked up thousands of dollars in medical bills so far. He had friends at the club who didn't say anything. He is white, about 6 ft tall or so, has short blonde hair. Help me get this guy off the streets and make him pay for what he's done.

Around 12:00 last night, my friend went to the bathroom at Maxwells. While i was waiting for him a white male with blonde short hair came up to me and pointed at two girls and said ""hey those girls are 10s huh!?"" after hesitating, i said i don't know them but i guess they're pretty cute. Then he replied ""you sound like a faggot"". I replied ""are you serious?"" we locked eyes, he said yeah. As i assessed the situation he immediately slammed his cocktail glass into the side of my head.

The guy that did this was white, has short blonde hair that appears to be thinning, probably a little younger than me pretty close to my height. I'll never forget his face.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The suspect was in his mid-to-late twenties and around six feet tall. If anyone has information that could help police nab the guy, please call the SLCPD Tips for Cash Hotline at (801) 799-INFO.

So having lived here for a while, and also lived and driven in many other high traffic areas, I have to ask, why are Utah drivers dumb as bricks?

Allow me to explain. In other major population areas, I encounter very aggressive drivers, and I am used to that. You learn to deal with it and can drive defensively accordingly. Here in Utah people seem to have no idea what is going on.

**Traffic Control Devices** 

What I have noticed is that Red Lights typically don't matter. I have never seen so many people run red lights before. Sure people go on yellow, but its different thing to still keep running through the intersection after the light changes.

Heaven forbid the traffic light be completely off. People have no idea what to do (although that is sometimes typical everywhere). Or better yet when a light goes to flashing red and yellow. No clue how to proceed. See below.

**Stop Signs**

Why do people just drive straight through stop signs? I don't get that. Or even why don't people understand how they work. 4 way stops are a nightmare. People just go haphazardly. Where as the driving rules generally state, ties go to the driver on the right, then continues in the order the vehicles arrive in. But frequently people just make a quick stop, and go right through regardless of right of way.

**Speed Limits**

I notice speed limits are typically ignored. In the city, driving well below the speed limit is common. Outside the city, well above. 4 lanes of I-15 all going below the speed limit. Why?? It's not rush hour, there is hardly any traffic.

**Ramp Meters**

Some are 1 car per green, some are 2 cars. There are tons of signs saying which is which. Time after time on 2 car meters, only one car goes. How is that even possible?

**Head Lights**

Why do people not drive with their headlights on? I have never encountered this beast anywhere before, except here. It will be dusk, raining, snowing, or even late at night. No headlights. What gives?

**Pulling Out In Front Of Vehicles**

This is the biggest pet peeve, and why I hate driving here. It's always like this big variable of every time I drive, of having to wonder, am I going to total my car today?

I see this everywhere, not just to me. People will pull out of side street right into traffic, right in front of an oncoming car. It's like they didnt even see the oncoming car.

What I find the most trouble with is, when people are trying to cross traffic to go the other direction. This happens on a near daily basis for me. Near my house the main road to my house goes straight with no stop sign, but there is a side street with a stop sign. Most traffic turns right on the side street. And most traffic from the side street turns left. So what I find is I get stuck in a group of people turning right, but when that clears and I can go straight, the car turning left just pulls out nearly every time, nearly t-boning me or me nearly t-boning them. What the heck?

**Blinkers**

Why does no one use blinkers?

**Summary**

So what causes this? Are Utah drivers, not taught how to drive at all? My out of state friends who live here all notice this same issues and it baffles us. We have some ideas, but the main one is that the people who live here are not generally very aware of their surroundings.

Case in point. Go to a RedBox, watch what goes on. I have been waiting in line to return a movie. I have seen people stand at the kiosks and flip through movies, then start texting or using their phone or generally standing in front of the kiosk. Meanwhile the kiosk has timed out. Leaving the rest of standing in line going WTF. I have even seen people rent a movie, pay for it, then been so engrossed in their phone or person with them, they dont see the kiosk spit the movie out, then after a period, take the movie back in because it wasnt picked up. Then they get mad at the kiosk. While everyone in line clearly sees this happening.

The most prominent example that I see is with my line of work. I work for a federal land agency. I wear a uniform that clearly says in no less than three places what agency I work for. It is also the universal agency uniform nationwide. Then while in my agency's land they will ask me how I like working for another government land agency. Despite being both on my agency land and me in uniform. I know these people are not out of states because it happens so frequently, and then they admit to being locals.

So guys, what is the deal? Why are people so unaware of their surroundings and thus terrible at driving?

&lt;/rant&gt;

TL;DR: Why are utah drivers so terrible at driving?

And I realize this a downvote happy subreddit, and how dare I insult the great people of this state. Instead, of downvoting and moving on, comment and explain yourselves.

Edit: Should be noted that not everyone is a terrible driver here. It's just that the number of bad drivers seems abnormally high.

Edit 2: Thanks for the comments, glad to see it's not just me and my friends who noticed this. But are there any actual clues as to why they are so dumb? What are the license requirements here? Back home you had to read a book and take a test (written and driving) to get a license.

Edit 3: Glad this has turned into a nice vent/discussion of the topic. Without any mass downvotes or offensive pandering. Go us."	t5_2r7ac	True

Back in December 2011, when I lived in Ohio. I had this scrawny cat show up outside my door. He looked sick and hungry. It was snowing outside so I let him in. Got some cat food and litter and kept him. I put up posters everywhere since a lot of people in my neighborhood had cats. I assumed he was someone's cat because he was well behaved.

The weather eventually cleared up, no one claimed him and he never left. I got him shots and neutered etc. My girlfriend came over and we realized she was super allergic to cats. She lived in Seattle and was only visiting for a couple of days so we lived with it.

Eventually I moved to SLC, the cat with me. Now thorough a fortunate chain of events I am moving to Seattle to be with her but she is allergic to cats. One of my friends was to take him but he backed out at the last minute (yesterday). I can't take him with me because my girlfriend is allergic and our apartment there does not allow pets. I drive out tomorrow and I don't want to give him up to the shelter.

About the Cat

He's a three year old short hair cat. He's playful and answers to his name, Woody, by running towards you at full speed, sometimes running into walls headfirst in the process. He loves to cuddle and sleeps by my legs at night and sometimes on me. When I'm on my computer he'll sit on my lap and go to sleep or on the chair backrest and my shoulder. He's not a shy cat and walks up to anyone who visits me and plays with them.

Uses the litter box and will let you know when he's hungry. Does okay with dogs as long as they don't chase him around. He does okay with my neighbors cats when I let him out in the backyard. He loves playing in the backyard.

TL;DR Refurbished cat needs a home.

EDIT: I forgot to mention I have a cat tree, a cat couch sort of a thing. Food bowls and litter boxes that woody will come with.

Edit 2 : mephlol has agreed to take Woody. Thank you all for your support guys. You are awesome

Does anyone have suggestions on any of the following: 

A particular hotel that could serve as a one-stop location for a small ceremony, private dining and accommodations while we and our guests are in town? I like modern/hip vs. traditional style and decor. The only hotel I've found so far is Hotel Monaco. 

Restaurants that could be rented out for a small ceremony/dinner? 

Reasonably priced photographer?

Guitarist/Singer that we could hire to play a song at the ceremony?

We want to keep this super low key and relaxed for the sake of my fiancé’s dad. There will be 20 guests at the most. We are somewhat flexible on the date, but we’re shooting for a Friday evening. I have only flown through SLC so I feel pretty lost at this point and to be honest, the internet searches I've done so far haven't yielded anything amazing, just your run of the mill hotel chains. There's gotta be some cute, hip, modern places, right? 

We briefly considered a destination wedding but I never imagined it would be like this! It just feels right though, to do it this way and I know it will be very special regardless.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the awesome ideas and generosity. Since we had planned on a larger event in Portland, budget should be sufficient with significantly fewer guests. I'd say venue, meal and photog are what I want to spend $ on. Everything else we will figure out if we have time! "	t5_2r7ac	True

1357773188.0	16a0pn	So UTA doesn't know why people won't ride in the winter...	jerisad	48	10	48	"So I saw [this](http://fox13now.com/2013/01/08/public-transportation-use-dips-on-red-air-days/) story about how ridership decreases on UTA on inversion days (aka-the coldest days of the year.) Below is what I wrote to them, but I'm almost certain it won't be read. 


*Last night I saw on the news that UTA was clueless as to why people were riding less frequently during an inversion, and the main suggestion was that if UTA were to make riding free it would increase ridership dramatically. I am on an Ed. Pass, meaning that I, more or less, ride for free, and in the past 4 years I have relied on Frontrunner and the busses to get me from Salt Lake to Ogden for school almost daily. It was never quite as convenient as driving but it was worth it. This year it is no longer worth it. 

I first noticed a major issue when you began running test trains from South of Salt Lake. When those trains were running the train arrived consistently late to Salt Lake, which in turn made the train late to Ogden, which made me miss my bus, which made me 10-15 minutes late to class every day, which is just not an option. The reduced hours on frontrunner have also been a problem. If you look at this image: http://i.imgur.com/nJppr.jpg , the red line indicates the train that would get me to school on time, notably absent. This is the train that allows people traveling to Ogden to reach nearly any destination by 9am. While students may not be a high priority for UTA, there are certainly plenty of people who need to reach work around 9am, I can’t imagine a worse route to cut. Because of this scheduling my options are to either be 45 minutes early or 15 minutes late to my class, I am opting to drive. 


I also leave school around 7:15pm, well after dark in ‘inversion season’. Because of the scheduling of the busses at this time, my bus must be exactly on time (which it rarely is) in order for me to make my train. If it is up to 3 minutes late, I am stuck waiting another hour for a train, and about 45 minutes of that is in the cold, dark, alone, in downtown Ogden. If you recall, last week after dark temperatures did not break 20F, you may also recall that Ogden is Utah’s crime capitol. While the station is well lit, it is little comfort when there is no security around to see something if it were to happen. 

After the 2.5 hour journey from bus stop to my car in Salt Lake, once again because of the new Provo line, I get to walk several block toward the homeless shelter after dark, once again without any security in sight. The Provo line is a nice idea, but as of right now there is NOT enough parking in Salt Lake City, and I often have to park much closer to the Rio Grande building than I would like. I think it is very ironic that your commercials show a very hip young woman taking frontrunner to yoga and trax to the symphony. What they do not show is her making that same journey, alone, after dark, in reverse to get home, they do not show how absolutely terrifying as a single woman it is to do so.  Frontrunner has never been a perfect system, especially since the hours were first cut several years ago, but at this point it is no longer worth the wasted time and risks to my health and personal safety to ride it.

If anyone works at UTA and feels that this is worth forwarding to someone with any power that would be lovely. 
If not, I would still love to start a discussion/rant about why riding UTA is or isn't worth it for you. "	t5_2r7ac	True

1338572147.0	ufw66	Friends, go to Salt Lake City's website and occasionally verify you don't have parking tickets. Salt Lake City's parking authority are a group of extortionists with no souls.	TylerRiggs	43	9	16	"I received a call last week from Rebecca Taylor at the Salt Lake City collections unit saying that if I didn't address a parking ticket I had that day, I would have a judgment filed against me in small claims court. 

I told her I didn't know of any parking ticket and asked her if she could send me the information, I would address it right away. I've received parking tickets (in SLC) before, and always pay them promptly. I'm a risk/reward kind of guy when I'm in a hurry or a special situation.

She said that they tried to mail me a letter about the ticket, but it was to a Logan address (the car that allegedly got ticketed was a 2008 Honda Civic, which WAS registered to my old address in Logan, and which I traded in in January for a new car.) She then said they also tried to mail something to another address they had on file, which was my current address, except she had the wrong apartment number. So essentially, they failed to deliver any notification of a ticket to me because I didn't get a physical ticket, and they couldn't get letters to me. 

So I gave her my accurate address and she sent me a notice that didn't give any details about the date of the parking ticket, or anything, just saying that I had until June 2 to address the issue or it would go to court and my credit would be impacted. I logged on to the city's website, entered in both my current and old license plate numbers, and saw my ticket record for my old car, with yes, an outstanding ticket (incidentally, I looked at my calendar from back at that date and I did leave my car overnight in an area that had a time limit because I had too much to drink that night, and I remember expecting a ticket but being glad I didn't get one.) 

So I called this Rebecca Taylor back and left messages saying that I acknowledged the ticket, and would like to pay the original price of the ticket, not thinking it fair to have to pay the penalty price (ticket was $15, they are saying I owe them $125.) However, Rebecca Taylor, being a soul-sucker who works for a soulless agency, without a shred of humanity, has ignored my messages. I went ahead and paid the $125 today because I don't want my credit impacted and I don't have time to fight this in court.

I'm encouraging all of you though to occasionally check the city's website at www.slcgov.com and make sure you don't have phantom parking tickets. Salt Lake City can get fucked for all I care at this point and this is going to have a direct impact on how I spend my money around the community. Rebecca Taylor can pound sand too.

tl;dr - Salt Lake City's parking authority is a bunch of pig fuckers out to rape taxpayers. You should check to make sure they aren't trying to rape you too.

1375051930.0	1j8nwr	My nerves are fried..	TheSeventhSon7	48	20	44	"I am ticked off and I need to vent.

""Parley's Nature Park"".. better known as ""The Gully"" in my neighborhood.. has become a complete joke.

This place used to be something special, a wilderness in the middle of a city. It was a place I spent most of my childhood summers, from playing in the river to riding my brand new mountain bike through the jump park. 

A few years ago they redeveloped the entire area and created a paved path all the way through the park. They destroyed natural vegetation and created fake trails through the once dense-shrubbery. They created rules outlining specific sections of the park where you can have your dog on/off leash (it used to be allowed throughout the park) and they have turned it into fucking lagoon.

Just this afternoon, a lazy Sunday walk through the park sounded fun. What I encountered was literally hundreds of dogs and people. Older teens drinking PBR and shooting the tube.. littering everywhere. Young children running around screaming while their parents paid little attention to them. I saw smokers throwing butts and inconsiderate bikers refusing to use common courtesy, I saw trash and poop that wasn't picked up. I saw graffiti and destroyed natural habitats.

To top it off, on my way out several twenty somethings were walking a large rottweiler with a weighted vest and clipped ears. The rottweiler without hesitation lunged at my young puppy and pinned her on the ground. I didn't think twice about kicking that dog as hard as I could in chest but I don't exaggerate when I say that it probably didn't even feel it. My puppy is screaming on the ground and these ass holes are trying to explain to me why their full grown rottweiler would never hurt a fly.

Now I am not one to ever judge a dog based on stereotypes, I don't care if its your goldy that is dangerous.. but if your dog is prone to violence why the fuck would you take it to such a place.

I ended up picking up my dog and running as the rottweiler continued to attempt to jump up and attack my puppy. Any words I wanted to say to the owners were pointless as my yelling only seemed to antagonize the situation.

What used to be a great childhood memory is now a place I can promise I will never go back. Vent session, complete. Thanks for listening. "	t5_2r7ac	True

redditgifts is myself and 5days and we currently live in the bay area.  We happen to really enjoy Utah (my parents live in Kaysville) and are considering a move to SLC.  We would need to open a small office in SLC and give redditgifts a nice home there!  We have two major needs that we're hoping we can get any help on (especially from fellow redditors).  Here are our issues:

1. We want to buy a house.  We have been looking in 2 places (upper avenues, sugar house) and need a reliable real estate agent who can help us.  This is a bit complicated as we don't live in the area and can only get there once a month at most to look at houses.

2. We have two children ages 8 and 10.  We want them to be in a good school but do NOT need public school.  We currently are in a charter school here in CA which focuses on community and does NOT focus on homework.  We LOVE this school and it is probably the only sticking point in our prospective move to UT.  So, anyone who is knowledgable about schools in or around SLC would be fantastic.  Even if you can put us in touch with your mom/sister/brother/friend/whomever who knows about schools we would love it.

We are also not religious (are atheist) so we don't want to live in happy valley or whatever.  

Any advice or help people could give us would be greatly appreciated!"	t5_2r7ac	True

A call the the SLC Justice Court is enough to get the warrant and record cleared, but they are unable and unwilling to do anything but send a ""clearance"" to the Driver's License Division. This means you will still show failure to appear and suspended license on your record and you will need to pay to have your license reinstated. Your insurance rates and validity may be effected, as well as your ability to apply for jobs in the future that involve driving. 

I am currently working through the bureaucracy to get this resolved, but neither the court or the Driver's License Division will take responsibility. 

If you received a ticket anywhere in the state of Utah 90 days on either side of July 2011 and did traffic school, contact your local court and make sure you do not have a ""failure to appear."" If you do, do not trust them that it is fixed until you get documentation from the court as well as the Driver's License Division. 

If you run into this issue please contact me as I am working on getting the attorney general involved to force the state to take care of this issue.

They said they stood by those exercising their free speech rights and would not remove them in any way.  He was out in the open talking to protesters and being frank and up front with them...

...No...  I'm disappointed in the protesters.  There is nothing going on there that made me feel like I should be down there with them.  It was full of all the stereotypes you'd expect at a protest, plus a substantial homeless population.  The guy talking to the media was wearing a shirt with Lenin and Stalin on it.  I'm down with Communism, but you need people who look like regular joes out there protesting and talking to the media.  You throw a hammer and scythe out there and all of a sudden it's that much easier to dismiss the message.  You need teachers to come out.  You need construction workers.  Working stiffs in shirts and ties.

It's harder to dismiss the message if you look and sound like everyone else.

The movement has to look like the 99% or else the 99% isn't going to join.  There was that redditor who said, ""Go protest in Khaki's and a polo shirt"" but that's only half the battle.  Get your message razor sharp.  You have a dozen different messages?  Fine.  But the media isn't going to run with it unless it's 15 seconds of a soundbite.  Have a media guy there who orchestrates all the best voices who look the most non-threatening and middle-America and when the media shows up, have him hand out a press kit to each media member.  ""If you want to talk to someone concerned about X, here's who we're making available...""  etc.  I want everyone to have a voice, yes, but if you're all shouting that there's no voice, then no one is going to listen to you....  You can set the agenda with the media, they'll let you do it.  You just need to play their game.  And I know there will be some overly pedantic college intellectual shaking his head and shouting about this, but deep down he knows I'm right.  

If the movement wants to get more traction, they can't have outposts like this."	t5_2r7ac	True

I have been an avid reader my entire life and have spent a significant amount of time in and around books, especially in the Salt Lake Valley.  I wanted to make this post to make you aware of both the most famous as well as not so famous bookstores in our area.  I will be focusing on independent bookstores that are within biking distance (and I consider biking distance to be 1.5 hours outside of downtown) of downtown.  While I think I have hit all the independent bookstores in town, I probably have missed several.  If that is so, please feel free to add your favorites and help this thread grow!

First, I will list all the books stores I have visited and their addresses. Second, I will give a rundown/review of each bookstore so you can visit them as it suits your taste and location.  I hope this helps! Now, in no particular order....

(801) 214-8191

Note: I left out bookstores like the Golden Braid because, well, they are a highly specialized ""bookstore"" and don't fit my criteria of bookstores for the general, well-read and broad reader.

Now, to review:

1 - (Sam) Weller's Book Works: Formally known as Sam Weller's book store and centrally located in downtown where Eborn books is located, this book store is a staple for book buyers.  Ever since its move from its downtown location, it is has fallen flat.  It is good for graphic novels, to build a used book collection on the cheap, for things in the vein of William Burroughs, classics, and other 60s books like the Beats.  It also has one of the best Art, Cooking and Children's book selections in town.  Its Art section is good and, with some digging, you can find some great items.  Used fiction books requires a few hours to round out your collection and score some great things.  However, it has fallen flat from its previous glory on its main st location.  The philosophy section is really piss poor.  I can't speak to its history section much.  Every other genre or theme is pretty dry.  Its rare books are interesting to browse and you can find many Modern First Editions - again, in Art, Architecture and fiction it has many stunning finds in the Rare Book department.  Poetry in the rare book room is hit and miss.  If you are looking for graphic novels it is a winner!  Well worth checking out to get a sense of the reading community in Salt Lake via its used books.  

Ken Sander's Rare Books - Admittedly, my go to book store. I shop here frequently. It specializes in Western Americana and Mormon literature and books.  It has a strong and healthy fiction section, a great selection of new World literature and politics and staff is highly knowledgable about books.  Their used fiction is amazing and for those looking to round out their collections, their prices can't be beat.  Like Weller's Book Works, they also have a hefty collection of Modern First Editions.  Regardless if you buy anything, it is worth stopping in to see all sorts of Rare books, rare ephemera from the 60s and really amazing books.  They are strong in Art (but you have to dig), fiction, Edward Abbey, McSweeney's, craft, photography, pulp, and science fiction.  Literature, as well, is well represented.  I have noticed that after semester's end, you can find several amazing books that college kids turn in from their studies.  It is worth mentioning their poetry section because out of all the book stores, theirs is the most extensive.  They have a good philosophy section, amazing graphic novel (especially wood cut graphic novel) section and various children's books and illustrators abounds.  It is a highly eclectic book store with a constant and steady stream of new inventory.  WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT!

3- Central Book Exchange - I have been in here a few times but not much.  They have a very strong presence of general fiction, plays and poetry.  There is not much that is uncommon or rare or outstanding.  If you spend the time, you will find some great condition books and some really great titles.  Standout titles I have picked up are tons of Dalkey Archive Press books as well as some philosophy books from Deleuze and Guttari, Baudriallard and plays by Joe Orton.  I don't guarantee that these titles or similar will be there however.  I find their prices to be a tad higher by a few dollars and their selection to be limited - anything you can find in the above two stores, you can find in this store for a few dollars more.  They tend to have better quality editions of books.  They also have an extensive romance section, cooking section and health/exercise section (including hiking).  They do have more newer titles than the above bookstores.  Across the street is a Barnes and Noble.  It is worth making a pitstop every once and a while to this bookstore to stock up on titles - every time I have gone in I have gone away with a few books that I would have never thought to be in Utah.  Always a pleasant surprise and worth a few hours of your time.

4- Where do I being here?? This store is a slapdash, books-crammed-in-every-corner type of bookstore - essentially your grandma's basement stuffed to the gills with books.  Two standout qualities about this bookstore are an extensive ADULT section with many periodicals, novels (both gay and straight - especially great for gay lit) and other novelties. as well as an amazing Golden and Silver age comic book store in the back.  Most of the books are junk.  Their literature section is worth checking out because things like THE MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES will appear for 5 dollars, hardback in slipcase in that section.  Their biography section is ok and their war and mythology section are worth a quick glance.  Outside of that, most everything else is not worth the time - if only just to see what junk you can find at any thrift store stuffed on the shelves in multiple copies.  Coincidentally, this book store is also a curiosity cabinet of just things interesting, banal, old and antique.  If you are downtown and have an hour to blow, go in and take a look!

5- I went to SuzyQ books today and spent two hours there.  It is small, quaint, intimate and nice. I love the ambiance of the bookstore. For the amount of books it has, and the price it sells them for, the amount of quality is the best out of any bookstore.  If you are looking to start your personal library - start here first! There are several GREAT titles here for a $1 in good to very good condition in the least. Melville, Vonnegut, James et al get represented here in full show.  Duras is here as well as amazing small fiction box sets.  They have a really interested collectibles section of Modern first editions.  I stumbled upon this bookstore and loved it.  Will shop here again.  The prices and quality of the editions is outstanding.  Note again: it is very small in comparison to the other bookstores.

6- This bookstore blows.  It is worth, maybe, an hour of your time. The things to check out are the literature and the rare books behind glass.  The rare books are worth looking out while getting a coffee at the coffee garden but the prices are horrible.  Most of the inventory is left over sluff from the Sam Weller move.  The only other thing worth wasting a breath on is the basement - it is highly unorganized, creepy and fun to roam around in.  If you like quarterlies, you can browse old magazine and quarterlies in the eerie basement.  That is worth your time, at least once.

7- Probably the farthest bookstore I have visited in the valley.  Like Ken Sander's the inventory is always changing and is constantly different.  I really love this bookstore - it is huge, the lady who runs it is super nice, and the prices are CRAZY good.  I bought an MIT press first edition biography on Alfred Barr for $5!!! A STEAL! You will find deals like this constantly in this bookstore.  It is a bit in disorder but it is super fun to browse and spend time borrowing in.  If you dig in enough, you can find something that is incredible.  There is an abundance, curiously enough, of Antonin Artuad books, many great cookbooks, many nice French language books, an ok Art section, and a stunning collection of quality edition of classics.  There is a TON of Mormon and religious books here - if that aint your bag half of the book store will be bunk. They also have a big section of Romance and Mystery novels.  Not to mention Self-help, sports and business/management books.  I would say those last three sections are bigger than they should be.  Also! Their children/illustrated book section is great for cheap quality children's illustrated books.  As you browse, look for rare books in the stacks - surprises I have stumbled upon included numerous Taschen first edition art books on maps and famous painters; an illustrated book by Langston Hughes on being Negro; a first edition of Little Lord Flauntleroy.  Again, worth checking out and browsing for a few hours and reading in the stacks!

8- The King's English is another staple of the literary Salt Lake scene.  I haven't been here as much as I should but it is a really great bookstore for new books.  It has the best selection (broadly over genre) of books out of any of the bookstores mentioned - this bookstore is a bit pricy (if you haven't noticed, I am a cheapskate!) and is for your real middle-class tastes and price range.  If you want to get AMAZING books at the $20 range this is the place.  Again, its strengths are in its selection, passionate bookish staff, and location.  Its only (subjective) downturn for me is its price.  I like discovering great used books for cheap.  If you like that, this isn't the book store for you.  However, regardless of that, this bookstore is a MUST VISIT.  Still very highly recommended.

9- The Red Queen is the only speciality shop I would recommend in SLC.  It is around the corner from Ken Sanders.  It specializes in rare illustrated and book arts books.  It is worth stopping in and chatting with the proprieter who happens to also be Ken Sander's daughter! She is highly knowledgeable and more importantly, enjoyable to talk to about books. Her speciality is fashion, fetish and Alice in Wonderland.  Amazing books reside here and if I had the 100s of dollars to spend you better bet your book full of booty I would shop here more often.

1374265487.0	1inkhh	Uniquely Salt Lake City food or restaurant	gov3nator	29	4	110	"Some friends and I are traveling across the country, and we'll be stopping in Salt Lake City for an evening. We're all big fans of Anthony Bourdain and his shows like *No Reservation*. From watching his show, the biggest takeaway is that when you travel, go off the beaten path, skip the touristy bullshit you can find anywhere, and sample the local culture that you can't find back home. My friends and I are just some people from Ohio, but none of us have been to Salt Lake City. So my question to all of you is, what are some uniquely Salt Lake City foods/restaurants/places/experiences that we won't be able to get anywhere else? 

I don't care if it's just a burger joint, as long as they do something that makes them stand out from a burger joint I can find in any other city. It can be a big restaurant found only in SLC, or it can be some rundown, shitty, hole-in-the-wall place. Or just some atmosphere that you can't replicate anywhere else. It can be anywhere that has some local dish or item that you can't get anywhere else. For example, I'm from Youngstown, Ohio and we're known for two dishes: wedding soup, and more importantly, [Brier Hill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_Hill) pizza. We have a large Italian population. [Wedding soup](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bbYchyOWfXw/UEfk106v_3I/AAAAAAAAAMY/rEnWiIFEi4Q/s320/WeddingSoup.JPG) has gone more mainstream now but is a soup containing mostly greens such as escarole and endives, chicken, small homemade meatballs, noodles, carrot bits, onions, salt and pepper, and a copious amount of cheese, either parmesan or romano. Every family does it differently, but what stands out from other canned wedding soups is that fact that the homemade Youngstown kind is thick and stuffed with items, not some watered down chicken noodle soup with a meatball thrown in. And [Brier Hill pizza](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_MYRNDMf_IWo/ShiDnnVgqJI/AAAAAAAAA3o/XAGUGP_geP8/s320/Brier_Hill_Pizza_Whole.jpg) is a homemade pizza with a spicy, slightly tart/bitter red sauce, bell peppers or hot peppers, sausage, and sprinkled with romano cheese. It's basically made by the same church and a few local restaurants since the early 70's.

So, now that I've given some examples, I'll ask again, what is something you would recommend that is uniquely Salt Lake City? Something, some food, some restaurant or hole-in-the-wall I won't be able to find anywhere else besides your City? We're open to anything and everything when it comes to food.

Tl;dr: What is a food/item/place/experience that you can't get anywhere aside from Salt Lake City? Something that either best represents the city or is truly unique to your city."	t5_2r7ac	True

- Keep a safe following distance. This means the 3 second rule. Most of you dumbasses can't even count to 1 mississippi going over 75 mph on the freeway.  
-You shouldn't be passing on the right, but if you do, don't be an asshole.  
-If you're going slower than the lane to the right of you, move over and let people pass you. If the person in front of you is passing traffic on the right, don't ride their ass and flail your arms in disdain. You are the idiot. Not them.  
- You see all those construction speed limit signs? They're there for everyone, but especially for the workers. There is a lot of debris on the road and if you're going too fast you can fling a rock or a cone at someone's head and kill them.   
-Weaving in traffic just makes you an asshole. You're saving a negligible amount of your douchebag time by doing it. If you drive a white sports car with black douchebag racing stripes, fuck you, because you cut me off yesterday and I'm tired of the way you people drive and you should be, too.

I travel a lot for work but SLC is my new favorite destination. I didn’t know a soul here but I have been completely overwhelmed by kindness from everyone I encountered. I’m still in disbelief about how many people I met and how much love there is in this city. It’s hard to describe it but I’ll give just a couple examples of the numerous experiences I had all week:

Betsygirl801 and Inco (Redditors) met me downtown and gave me the grand tour of SLC night life. We bar crawled all night, they explained a lot of the local stuff to me, and made me feel right at home!

Another night I got off work late and stopped by The Pie for a a slice and a beer. A group of people saw me looking for a table and invited me to sit with them. They poured me a beer and didn't waste one second making me feel like a damn celebrity. Then they brought me to a bunch of their favorite spots downtown. After that they brought me back to a party at their house where they did a bunch of fire poi dancing. It felt like something out of a movie.

Thanks everyone so much for an amazing experience. My flight is here so I have to go but I just want all you Salt Lakers to know that you are beautiful people and you live in an amazing city! Don’t ever change! Hit me up next time you’re in Denver. "	t5_2r7ac	True

It's been a bit difficult for her to find things that she likes to do to keep her busy. Can anyone suggest some things for them to do? What about in any of the college towns nearby?

She's also concerned about job prospects. She graduated with high honors in media studies and worked for a pretty large digital media center where we went to school (U of Illinois). Are there many editing or video production jobs in the vicinity?

Already been to:

1. [XSI Factory / Zombie Apocalypse](http://zombieutah.com/) - Great. Got a T-Shirt, Lanyard, and comic book. Literally RAN like a baby through the thing! Enjoyed this. Zombies...zombies everywhere. There was a cool 3D section where they give you glasses to wear during it...pretty trippy and creative.
2. [Strangling Brother's Haunted Circus](http://www.stranglingbros.com/) - Good. Scary clowns and crap everywhere, it seemed a little discombobulated but overall decently creative. 
3. [Nightmare on 13th](http://www.nightmareon13th.com/) - Meh. We went on a bounce back night, not a good idea if you don't have a wristband. We got VIP and skipped the line...totally worth it b/c it was full of 11-17 yr olds and we didn't want to deal with them. Few things were similar to last year...which was disappointing. Felt at times, a bit random...like no connection to where you were going next...the picture was great!
4. [Haunted Forest](http://www.hauntedutah.com/forest.html) - (went last night) This was the best so far! It felt so creepy right from the start! Lots of scares, loud noises, things you just didn't expect. Only downside here was that it was really muddy in one part so wear shoes you don't care to get dirty and girls...no heels. :P This was my favorite because it felt like a continuous haunting, it wasn't ""disconnected"" or just like random crap all over the place, they really kept with the theme. I would do this again!


Planning on:

1. [Fear Factory](http://fearfactoryslc.com/)
2. [Asylum 49](http://www.asylum49.com/NEW%20SITE/index1.html)
3. [Black Island Farms / Nightmare Acres](http://www.blackislandfarms.com/haunted.php)
4. [Haunted Hollow](http://www.hauntedutah.com/hollow.html)

Here's the story ladies and gentlemen,

My neighbor feeds many strays.  She works on getting them adopted, but I thought I would help her with this one.  This guy does not enjoy being a stray.  Especially now that it's so cold.  I've taken him temporarily and I keep him in my spare room with food, water, litter.  I would take him honestly, but I have two girls already and he doesn't play well with others.

He is awesome though.  He's a loner, so if you want just one cat, he's perfect.  He's vaccinated, neutered, and may be microchipped but we aren't sure.  He is crazy affectionate and loves attention.  Here, he can be a little testy because of all the other cats he has to deal with.  He has scratched me before but it was only because he was scared.  Also, he's not a mangy stray.  He's in really good shape.  In fact, he's a bit fluffier than the pictures in that album because his winter fur is crazy thick.

Here's what we're looking for:
Someone who will keep him indoors, does not have children (concerned about his scratching still), and along that vein, will not have him declawed.  If he's declawed, he may become a biter.  Also, if in the worst case scenario he came back to us and needed to live as a stray again, he would be screwed without claws.  She (my neighbor) asks $30 dollars.  This is recommended by most animal welfare agencies to show the adopter is serious.  It will also help cover a small portion of the last vet bill.  

Don't be turned off by the reference to his clawing, he really is incredibly sweet.  You are welcome to meet him before adopting.  We live in North Ogden so it's about 40-50 minutes from salt lake depending on traffic.   

**TL;DR: I have a stray in my house.  He is amazing and is well deserving of a home.  Contact me and save a kitty.**

1355394895.0	14s2w7	I'm a teacher in Bountiful who has an opportunity to get 7 laptops for $432 is I can get some support. 	michann00	29	9	19	"Google worked together with DonorsChoose to offer a limited amount of the Samsung Chromebooks for $99. I was fortunate enough to get in on the deal (which ran out within 24 hours of announcement). I have 2 programs I really would like my students to work on to individually work on skills they struggle with. This will not take place of teaching time, but will be a part of a daily center so students who struggle will work on exactly what they struggle with and those who are excelling will be able to work on the level they are on. I know the Chromebooks aren't perfect for everyone, but they will honestly transform my classroom.
Why am I trying to get it funded in the first 7 days? Well, each teacher has 7 days to use the match code INSPIRE for donations on their project that doubles any donation. So if you donate $10 and put in the code, you actually donate $20. 
Usually when you donate through DonorsChoose, if you donate over $50, you get a set of letters from the students. Well, to you redditors, if you donate over $10 (so it'll be $20 with the code), message me and I'll have a few of my students write you a thank you note. I make sure it's safe by not including last names. I will tell you my students draw the greatest things on their thank you notes. You could even request pictures (as long as they were appropriate)
Anyway, here's the link to this amazing opportunity and I really hope it doesn't fall through my fingers.

If you work for a company or know of a company who needs some charitable tax write-off's this is a non-profit and you'll get a receipt as well. Thanks you r/SaltLakeCity - Bountiful isn't that far away.

TLDR: Donate to my class using the code INSPIRE, a $10 donation w/a message from you on here and I'll have some students write a thank you with an amazing picture on it. I have 7 days to do this.

UPDATE: Wow! We are already down to $283, but with matching that's only $142. If you gave, please make sure to message me your info, they only give me info on those who give over $50, but I want to make sure I write thank you's to those who did $10 or more. I do see lots of pics of kittens in my near future.

UPDATE 2: Thank you Reddit! We have 7 Chromebooks coming to our classroom in January. I'm looking up some more things we'll be able to do with them and I cannot wait to get rid of the 4 computers and desks that are taking up a corner of my room.

We've posted around prior to starting our trip and now we are currently on the road. Our hope is to arrive in Salt Lake City around August 8th for a few days. We'd love to take you to breakfast and interview you.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 

If you are interested - please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. Please include 'SLC' in the subject line. 

**The Details**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

1337984313.0	u55i6	I'm beyond horrified. A teen was kidnapped in Utah and the police wouldn't do anything to help him, neither would the FBI or other local authorities. Does anyone have any media contacts we can tell his story to?	pixel8	26	5	24	"Hi, I started /r/troubledteens to save kids from [abuse at 'troubled teen' facilities](http://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/l7r94/welcome_rfirstworldproblems_if_you_are_like_most). Tonight a story has come to my attention that has me burning up. tl;dr at the end.

A teen was being held at [Discovery Academy](http://www.discoveryacademy.com/) in Provo, Utah. When he turned 18, the school was legally obliged to let him go, keeping him past his 18th birthday is illegal. He had committed no crime, was not ordered there by the courts, as a matter of fact his mother sent him there because he was depressed after his father died.

They kept him for months after his 18th birthday. His mother insisted he stay there, but at 18 he is legally an adult and free to leave. His girlfriend's mother called the authorities and they refused to help. Then advocates called and they refused as well. Finally, the advocates got in touch with a national talk show radio host, Mark Levine. He called and got nowhere as well. Two nights ago he did a [show exposing the situation](http://marklevine.tv/does-the-city-of-provo-endorse-kidnapping/). Yesterday he called back and pressed the police, and magically they let him go. Fortunately, is safe now.

Mark details the ordeal everyone went through in this [radio show](http://marklevine.tv/patrick-is-free/) tonight. I'll give you some of the main points:

- The police seemed initially interested, but after talking to the kid's mother, they said there was nothing they could do. **Even though keeping him there was a crime, and this was pointed out to them.** 

- What gets even weirder is the officer told advocates that she had met with the teen and he said he was fine and wanted to stay. The teen had been begging his girlfriend and her mother to get him out, he said no officer ever met with him.

- Even weirder is when Mark Levine called, the same officer at first said she met with the teen, but later refused to confirm or deny that fact. She told him to call Discovery Academy and ask them about their policies. Mark told them that if his wife was kidnapped, he would not call the kidnappers and ask them their policy. She still refused to budge or help him.

- The FBI said it did not meet their criteria and did nothing.

- CPS would not get involved because he had turned 18 and was no longer a minor.

- The local disability rights org, who is mandated by the state, was willing to help but not quickly. They offered to file a lawsuit, which would take at least a month, and probably drag out longer. Also, his mother claimed he was disabled when she enrolled him, but now said that he wasn't. 

- There are allegations that Discovery Academy abused the teen, but we don't have a lot of info about that. Yet.

What finally happened is that Mark called back yesterday. After getting nowhere with the same officer, he called the press contact at the police station and explained what was going on, and that he was going to be doing a national radio show that night exposing them. Finally, the Discovery Academy released the teen. They threw him to the streets with no money, an advocate took $670 out of her own pocket to buy him a plane ticket back to Massachusetts. Another advocate met him at the his layover location to give him some food and a little spending money. Discovery charges somewhere in the neighborhood of $60/k a year, you would think if they care about kids they would've treated him better.

I'm beyond shocked. Discovery Academy does not surprise me, I've heard all kinds of horror stories about facilities similar to that one. But the authorities did NOTHING? I mean, in the end I guess they got involved, but that was after months of inaction. No one has been arrested; no one at the school, and certainly not that police officer. If you or I decided to hold someone captive at our house, you better believe the SWAT team would be all over us.

Does anyone have any media contacts we can get his story out to? People in Utah need to know about this. I can put the media in touch with the advocates who tried to help him, probably the girlfriend's mother, and possibly the kid himself. My email is redditroubledteens@gmail.com if you can pass it along. Any other ideas are welcome, thank you, [/r/SaltLakeCity](/r/SaltLakeCity), for any help you can give.

**tl;dr: An 18 year old who committed no crime was held against his will for several months at Discovery Academy in Provo, Utah. This is highly illegal. His friends, advocates and finally a member of the media got involved, it took months to get him released. No one has been charged with a crime. There are allegations that he was abused.

I wouldn't panic about this since I think it's just some punk kids with nothing better to do, but if you live around 1700 E 10600 S, or just general Sandy/Draper area, keep an eye out for tire slashers.  Myself, my sister and I, and 30+ cars in the area had two tires (per car) slashed between 11pm and 6am.

I'm not saying start a neighborhood watch or anything, but if you happen to be getting home late and see some punk kids, call the police.

At the very least I'd try to arrange to get your outside cars parked in the garage if you can (I know that the reason they're outside is because you probably don't have room in the garage or have a garage).

Also a HUGE shoutout to [Hillside Tire](http://hillsidetire.com/location-sandy.php) in Sandy, Mark ( the manager) was super helpful and patient with everybody that day.  He even sent his assistant manager Chris up to our neighborhood to help people get tires arranged correctly (the way most of the cars were slashed made it impossible for tow trucks to load the vehicles).

**TL;DR: Tire slashers in Sandy area around 10600 S 1700 E area (but not up in Pepper wood from what I heard), if you happen to live in that area or in Sandy/Draper generally and get home late, call cops if you see anyone slashing tires.**

Yesterday afternoon Salt Lake City Corporation sent about a dozen city officials and police to shut the building down and remove everyone from inside. The building is mostly used as offices and studio space. It houses developers, architects, artists, and others. In the past it has been the location for art shows and various performances.

I know all of this because it is where our office is located. 

We were told to get whatever we wanted out because it would be difficult to get back in later. I was actually offsite at the time it originally happened and had to be escorted in by someone from the  fire marshal's office to pack up our computers and other essentials.

I'm not posting this looking for sympathy or as a way to bash the city -  I don't really know the circumstances around the building getting red tagged. I do hope the issue can get resolved soon as we still have a lot of things in there. I have a feeling we may not be able to get back to normal any time soon, however.

Anyways, I thought it might be of interest to some people here. The building has a Facebook page (linked above), there may be more updates there in the future if you are interested in following the story.

2) We get together and discuss the book, moderated and encouraged by that month's champion.
3) We select the following month's champion. This person puts together a short list and circulates it around via Reddit or an e-mail list that we'll probably put together. We all give thoughts, mostly as to whether or not we've read it, or if we're interested in reading or re-reading.
4) Champion selects a book based on input, posts it in r/slc with the next month's meeting time, then WHAM! Book clubbed.

I'm taking the lead on this month. DrPatient is on it for March.



For the month of February, we will be meeting on **Saturday 11 February** at the **Salt Lake City Public Library** from **1 PM - Whenever**. 

The book will be *Pale Fire* by Nabokov.

I work in industrial construction and travel from state to state doing short-term jobs for various contractors. I'm starting a job at a power plant in Lindon on the 9th. Well, I have a younger sister who is a single mom in her mid-20's with an awesome little 6-year-old girl. She was living in Texas (where we are orignally from) and has been struggling out there - trying to get out of an abusive relationship and on her own feet. I suggested that she come out to Utah and try to make a fresh start out here. I worked a job here years ago, I know there is a lot of focus on family here, and had read that this area offered some good family assistance. I paid for her to come out here and she's been crashing with us for a few days, but unfortunately, I don't have a place of my own here. My wife and I are living in a hotel while we look for something a little more permanent and she and her daughter are crashing with us. It's not the most ideal situation, but it's better than being on the street. My neice is actually enjoying it immensely because we've been taking her sight-seeing. My sister was going to check into a crisis center for women in Provo, but I gave her the option to stay with us instead. I don't want to see my neice go into an environment that might not be safe for her (it might be perfectly safe there - I have no idea). She's a good person, doesn't do drugs or anything, but has been in a couple of bad relationships and my other family members may have been more damaging than helpful, I think.

The question I have is: Where is the best place for my sister to try and get set up? I'm staying in Sandy right now because the hotels closer to my job are booked because of the Forth of July festival down there. My thought was that Provo would be a good spot for her because of BYU and all the young adults there, but since I'm not a local, I really don't know. She's going to have to find some type of assistance as far as getting a place of her own, day care for her daughter, etc. She is a hard worker and wants to get a job and some independence. I'm helping her as much as I can, but she doesn't want to feel like she's mooching off her brother. I wanted to see if I could get some direction from some locals. Any suggestions or information about the different areas around SLC that might help her situation would be much appreciated."	t5_2r7ac	True

It will take place at Squatters Pub &amp; Brewery in downtown Salt Lake City at 5:00. Tickets are $50 for general admission, and $10 for folks under 36.

Dean served as governor of Vermont prior to his 2004 campaign for president, and went on to be named chairman of the Democratic National Committee. During his campaign and work with the DNC, he pioneered many of the grassroots organizing methods we see in races all over the country at every level. In particular, his “50 state strategy” helped propel the Democratic Party forward in traditionally conservative states, and is often credited as a key influence in President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. He went on to found Democracy for America, a progressive PAC.

Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill will also address the crowd.

**This is an all-ages event.**

Hey theTransistor,

I need your help for a project that will bring me to Salt Lake City to teach folks how to organize mesh networks.

My proposal, Community Wireless Across America (http://crowdhitch.millennialtrain.co/campaign/detail/1330), is to teach civic technologists in 10 cities across America how to organize and maintain wireless mesh networks. We'll share tools and methods for participatory technology pedagogy, and the routers that we set up together will remain with people in Salt Lake to seed your own mesh networks. With these seeds spread, organizers and technologists in Salt Lake can continue to grow locally-managed networks and spur innovation on a shared platform accessible to any resident.

In order to do the project, I have to raise $9,000 by July 1. That’s $900 per city - can you help Salt Lake raise $900 to help folks like you spread mesh networks? http://crowdhitch.millennialtrain.co/campaign/detail/1330

Here is more about the Millennial Trains Project (http://millennialtrain.co/) and my donation page: http://crowdhitch.millennialtrain.co/campaign/detail/1330

Cheers and looking forward to hearing from you,
