1331130912.0	qlqzd	Am I the only one who is suspicious about Invisible Children, the organisation behind Kony 2012?	pussyhands	5324	3559	986	"Lets try this in a better sub reddit... 

I've done a fair bit of looking into it, and everything doesn't add up. Heres my findings and I have included sources. Will probably get down voted to hell but I hope to give at least one of you a better understanding of whats going on.

Theres ALWAYS two sides to every story. This viral film has caught the attention of heaps of young folk but you are all far too late. Watching that Kony video is essentially watching old news. They started filming in 2003, and northern Uganda has been free of LRA violence and war for over five years. In fact, the LRA have signed a peace accord! They are rebuilding and are restoring the peace.

Yes the leader is still out there however the recruitment of children has decreased 80%. This isn't due to the Invisible Children organisation, its because Ugandan military and the ICC have intercepted.
The Invisible Children group are trying to pass a bill that allows America to militarise the region... They are providing misinformation to woo idealistic followers. The group have combined multiple regional conflicts to make it appear that this is one rapidly increasing issue. When confronted about their dodgy tactics, the head spokesperson stated;

“I agree with you that leading people to believe that the war is still happening in Uganda is not ethically right. It's something we've been addressing internally, focusing on getting all staff and supporters on the same page (of communication).""

If you read the news, or even had an ounce of interest in the on-going unrest in Africa you would already know this and not be fooled. Yes, awful things happen to people in 3rd world countries but this has been occurring for centuries, it isn't a recent occurrence.

I think its only fair if I am to make such comments I provide sources (unlike the people over at Invisible Children...)

SOURCES:
Michael Kirkpatrick, a long-time Independent Global Citizen, he has resided in Uganda and other regions of Africa. He has no political, religious or financial agenda. He wrote this article and gave an in-depth insight to whats really going on. He also questioned important members of Invisible Children about their motives. http://www.blackstarnews.com/news/122/ARTICLE/6586/2010-06-02.html

Charity Navigator is a website that breaks down the proceeds and donations given to Invisible Children and subsequently shows what percentile of that is REALLY going towards these impoverished kids. A measly slither of what is going into the founders pockets. http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=12429

I've read an interesting passage from Northern Ugandan man however it is not 100% verified - he has advised the Northern Ugandan parliament have listed IC as their main priority on their ""fraudulent activity"" list. (See 2nd comment, username Livingstone). http://www.topix.com/forum/city/stuart-fl/TQJSGHMES035Q6OI0

THIS article asking Invisible Children why they were pressuring poor AND illegal piece of legislation has since been removed and deleted. http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/2010/03/oklaholdout-update-letter-from-lisa-dougan/

ADDITIONALLY - There were members of Invisible Children were saying what their ""allowance"" could purchase them, it was on a forum on the official website, and this has also been REMOVED. http://blog.invisiblechildren.com/?p=5901

I am freaky patriotic. My most prized possession is a vintage 48-star flag (I'm from Arizona, 48th state) and my favorite holidays are Independence Day and Valentine's Day (because AZ became a state on February 14th, 1912!).

But it just makes me embarrassed for everyone, especially the soldier/vet, when someone gushes like that. Often the ""hero"" tends to just look down out of pure discomfort and mutter a humble *thank you*.

You don't know ANYTHING about this person other than they were in the army once and now they're not.

Maybe he's a shitbag who beats his gf. Maybe she mowed down a school full of Afghanis for perverted enjoyment. Maybe he's a bigot who wants to hang every last dark-skinned human on the planet. Maybe she's a whore who cheated nonstop on her last deployment. Maybe he's just a totally lazy idiot who couldn't hack it as a civilian and freaked out when his first kid was born out of wedlock and he hadn't even turned 20 yet.

Or...yeah, maybe she's a heroic human being who lives with strength, grace and dignity and does the armed forces, our country and the human race proud. But there's no way you could fucking know that in 13 1/2 seconds of conversation. So chill out with your Ameriboner and just talk to people like people.

1313012179.0	jf0ky	DAE wonder whether we all actually see the same colors?		117	15	35	"For some reason, ever since I was a little girl I have always wondered if we perceive colors differently. I know we can tell when someone is ""color blind"" when they can't distinguish between certain colors, but that's not what I am talking about here.

I'm not great at communicating ideas, but let me try to elaborate: we all (except the colorblind) can distinguish at least 7 colors (ROYGBIV). But, for example, I only know that green is green, because I saw some grass and my mother told me it was ""green"" colored. That doesn't prove to me that we are seeing the same color, only that the grass is a color that we both call green. 

What if her eyes see ""green"" as the color that I learned to be red and vice versa? If I visited her brain, I would see the grass as what I would call red, but my mom just calls it green because that is the color that she knows to be green. Woah. Back to my brain and it looks normal green again.

There is probably some science about how the human eye works that proves we all see the same colors, but out of curiosity, I've always wanted to be inside someone else's brain, just to see precisely how they perceive the world.

Anyone else?

Look, I'm honestly not high right now, though I am a little bit drunk. I'm not on any drugs other than alcohol. But sometimes I look in the mirror and I realize I have this body, and I contort my face to make different expressions, and it is absolutely wild. I realize that I'm this person, in this reality that is absolutely compelling. And I'm just amazed at this, because, well who wrote the rules of reality to make this happen? Why am I a person, in a reality? Why is there even a reality in the first place? And how amazing is it that I could just walk around and interact with other people who have had many of the same experiences as me. And there is an unimaginably large number of them, too. It blows my mind.

...write a book
...visit an auto museum
...do yoga every day
...get really good at drawing
...learn more about programming
...do more exercising
...immerse myself in learning French

Of course, when I do get some free time, nothing is nearly as appealing as it seems when I'm busy.   That may be due to the fact that even if I take a week off from work, or my wife and kids are out of town, I know that my free time is only temporary, so it seems pointless to start up some longterm project.

So I've even imagined winning the lottery and never having to work again.  And even being single as well, with no responsibilities at all.  Even then, I feel that I would probably just sit around staring at the walls (or just reading reddit!) all day.

So what's the deal?  Is longing for freetime just another case of ""the grass is always greener""?

I live at home currently and going to school but I don't even want to do that anymore. I have some money saved up and the willingness/urge to GTFO. I don't have much student debt and I really don't have any close friends anymore. I really wouldn't be missing anything!

So I live in buffalo and I want to move somewhere. I am pretty tech savvy but have only been going to school for comp sci for 1.5 years of a 4 year degree. Not much to do on that though I love the subject I hate school. I feel like it moves too slow for me and I am bored with driving 40 minutes to school every day to learn what I could have in an hour at home from the textbook. I think I could find a job and teach myself the rest of what I need to know and I don't think that is too ignorant. I have worked some pretty rough jobs to get by before anyways (as a mover which is tough on the body for 10$/hr and obviously other unqualified labor).

I think I have a time frame now where if I really don't have the mentality to finish school I should just leave so I am not being pressured into the same old crap, not to mention I feel the will to both move on and start anew. 

I mean, I wouldn't be doing this in like a day or two so I would think about this a lot, I.e., where to go, having a place to stay, and maybe even have a job lined up.

I had an old friend that did just this and stayed with relatives, she seems happy about it though I havn't spoken to her in over a year now.

Angus beef is the only beef.  Every fast food chain has an Angus burger.  Also, as much as I love bacon, I'm tired of seeing every burger joint announce their generic beef with a bunch of bacon on it burger.

Higher class restaurants fry everything in duck fat now.  

Things that already had fiber in them are NOW WITH FIBER/WHOLE GRAINS!  Popcorn comes to mind.  Popcorn has always been a whole grain.

[–]redphinn (_) 1 point 48 milliseconds ago
After giving this much thought I realized that me and my SO will shout random numbers and words out when one is talking and the other is out of ear shot. As soon as I hear 13!!! I know he can't hear me and I don't waste my breath. It's really effective but I just imagine our neighbors think we have some kind of affliction.
That is all :)

And a weirder thing is, sometimes the word isn't even there. My brain just recalls a word from somewhere else, and I think I saw it on that shelf. Then I'll spend a really long time looking for it, and realizing it's not there. Then I'll have to figure where it *was* from. O_o

It doesn't help that my TV is on at all times when I'm at home, so I basically just re-watch the earlier seasons of Simpsons, South Park, Arrested Development, Home Movies, etc.  

It's ridiculous because most of the time I'm not even paying attention, and I'm very hesitant in watching something new or of higher substance (plot wise), else I'd actually have to pay attention and not be able to multi-task at the same time.  

But I'm starting to worry that it's making me brain dead by watching the same things over and over, with no new stimuli. I've probably seen every episode (S1-S9) of the Simpsons 12 times now these last two years and I'm not even exaggerating.

The difference in our conversations is... amazingly different. My friend of a decade, let's call him R (I don't care if he finds this, he's already informed me that he knows my reddit name) I really like him because he's intelligent and creative but when we get together... we say the most vile things to each other, and pretty much always have. Pretty much imagine it and we've said worse. Almost every conversation usually ends with ""i hope you die"" Of course we are both kidding (i hope). I then have this other friend, we'll call him E. We haven't known each other as long, and we've never even met. We've talked on the phone, skyped, stuff like that. He lives in ny, and i'm in nj so we plan on meeting soon. Again, he's very intelligent and creative but our relationship is 100% different. We're always talking about how we value each other's intellect and insight, and talking about serious tihngs and life issues. R and I are the same age (24) and E is 3 years younger, dunno if that matters. So really what it boils down to..

Same thing with relationships. If I meet someone nice I might tell my friends but I don't mention it to my family. Maybe after a few months if things still look good I'll probably tell them. I've had enough breakups where I've felt stupid for having had too high expectations and telling everyone too soon, and then when it doesn't work out you have to listen to people's comforting attempts and ""she just wasn't right for you"" comments.

I've noticed I do this with a lot of ""big"" things that might affect my life in a good way, and it works for me. If something goes well, I'll share it.

I dread the summer months as much as most people dread the winter months, but whenever I admit this, people look at me as if I'm of a different species.

It's a little annoying because everybody wants to ""have fun in the sun"" i.e. go to the beach, eat/drink outdoors when I like to remain indoors with air conditioning or sit in the shade with as little sun as possible. I don't know why, I just don't like sunshine or the summer season but I've found it surprisingly difficult for this preference to be accepted amongst my family and friends. One of my closest buddies even said to me ""Don't be so emo"" which I didn't like, and I'm pressurised by my family to go on a trip with them to an exotic beach. I no longer enjoy these type of holidays; I explained that I'd much rather visit Iceland but everyone felt disappointed and regarded me as some sort of moody, selfish ""weird"" person.

and these (symmetrical) characters face neither way:
i o v w x A H I M O U V W X Y T 8 0

A possible explanation is that most characters seem to have a 'spine' (for example the vertical line in 'b'), off which other lines protrude from either one side or the other, giving the impression that the character faces to that side. But this does not explain letters like 'z' and '5'.

I would also be interested to know if anyone disagrees with the direction I've assigned to the letters above, as if they do it may suggest that it is subjective.

I used to be obsessed with graphics, graphic cards, sound cards with 5.1 audio, and (I'm dating myself here) CD-ROM access time.  Now I don't care.  I have a Wii that I use primarily for Netflix, but I play the occasional game - the one that came with it (the one with the vacation island - I can't even remember the name).  I'm even satisfied with the graphics of the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games I have. I simply stopped caring. I've got too many other priorities in my life now, and playing a time consuming game just doesn't matter to me any more.  I see the games coming out now, and I think to myself ""wow, this is really gorgeous - but I don't care and I don't have time"".

It's very strange - now that I'm older, and I can literally afford to spend $10,000 on a computer system if I want, and buy any game I want - I just don't care. I built a system for about $800 and I'm happy with it.

1333729089.0	rwfq2	Does anyone else feel that America is a lost cause?	oquin70	47	16	58	"First off, I'd like to preface this with I know there are many MANY people that are in much worse situations than I am. I guess you could say that this is the ultimate first world problem.

I read articles about Americans having to pay $3000 for a saline drip and pain pills if they don't have insurance, while the rest of the first world has free (or very close to it) health care. People that are afraid to go to the hospital because of the bills they will get. People literally *dying* because of it. 

I read about police officers severely abusing their power and getting away with it (I consider paid leave then coming back on to the force without repercussions ""getting away with it""). Beating people, putting people in the hospital because of their excessive force, even [putting the wrong man in a coma](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2009/07/31/prosecutors-decline-to-file-charges-against-deputy-who-put-man-in-coma after slamming him into a wall) (the video is not pleasant to watch).

I read about politicians lying through their teeth, making fake promises and also abusing *their* power. Insider trading, tax cuts, accepting money from lobbyists, letting corporations walk all over our individual rights as the people *we elect to protect them* stand by accepting the money the business give to make it happen without a second thought.

Now I expect a story or two along these lines every day. It has become the norm for me. And for every one I lose more and more hope.

1331136211.0	qlujy	DAE think reddit mods should be given a 'move thread' function to move threads that have already gained popularity in a sub-reddit where it shouldn't be to the correct sub-reddit?	Stockypotty	39	1	6	"I've noticed quite a few threads have gained a lot of popularity only to be deleted without much information as to why.

Normally the case is that it didn't fit in with the sub reddit rules, which is completely understandable. However why don't we just have a move thread function so mods can move a thread that already has a lot of upvotes and comments to the correct sub-reddit without being deleted?

The most recent one obviously being the thread about the visible children tumblr thread being deleted. It created a lot of confusion as to why it was deleted, and the OP had to re-submit it to this sub-reddit. It clearly had a lot of interest too (I think 1400 upvotes) and it seems like a waste for it to be deleted outright.

The idea being that the thread is ranked in the sub-reddit it is moved to according to how many upvotes it had at the time it is moved.

And my dad, while well meaning, would say weird spiritual sayings that didn't really explain anything like ""Well, we are created as sexual beings."" And there was this threshold idea like once you've seen images they're with you forever. So once I crossed that line, I felt like well might as well enjoy myself. And I guess they said it's a sin to lust. But I felt like that's like take someone who's addicted to heroin and then magically it so  there's a special form that just by seeing the drug you get high, and then make half of everyone in the world into big walking bags of it.

They're pleas for donations are becoming more and more intrusive on their pages, which leads me to believe that it hasn't been the most effective means of financing their operation. On top of that, they say that the money will go to funding wikipedia for as additional year, in which after that, they'd have to start over again with their fundraising.

That's an overstatement, but I guess what I'm really getting at is that I have no type.  It's actually sort of baffling to me that people do have types and more or less stick to them when dating.  None of my ex-girlfriends or women that I've dated really look like each other.  There's no real common thread in physical attributes like height, weight, race, body type, etc., and their personalities have been pretty diverse as well.

I'm not quite sure if it's a pro or a con, but it's greatly expanded my dating pool.  On the one hand, I can hit the town and pretty much be guaranteed to find multiple women I find attractive, however that opens up the possibility the person I talk to will be undesirable in some other way.

One definite con is that it often it's created a certain degree of insecurity with my girlfriends.  A lot of times my girlfriends doubt whether I really find them attractive because they feel like the pool of what I find attractive is so wide that they just fall in there by default.  I don't find EVERY woman attractive, but for some reason I get that reputation.

When I try to have a type or be more focused, I end up having these weird, fleeting fetishes.  I'm an ass man at the core, but right now boobs are the thing, and I want to date a woman with huge boobs.

""...nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, color, sex, religion, etc.... Theyre all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything.""

This quote was plastered all over the place and really annoyed me. It's a nice sentiment (don't hurt people, don't discriminate, life's fleeting, love people). That said, IMO this was just some vapid sound bite that people grabbed onto, without it really making sense when you think about it:

-Not sure why the haves would hurt the have-nots. People generally hurt people for want of things they don't have (money, power, food, sex, etc.)

-I can think of a few things one might have that are worth hurting others to protect, if said ""things"" were in danger and in need of defending: one's children, freedom, personal safety...

-Not sure why the quote shifts from being about giving up all desire for things to not discriminating for dumb shit--but we'll let it slide.

-Kind of betrays the previous point to follow up the bit about not discriminating with the overall reduction that they're all just people...aren't they so much more than just some generalization (not just color, sex, race and other generalized bs.)

-You could probably lose a lot by trying to love people--which doesn't mean one shouldn't try to--but makes me think this quote is baloney. Love is about risk, and the potential to lose, but taking that risk despite it. 

For example, trying to feel the love of a seemingly heart-touching AMA from a supposedly terminally-ill person might end up costing your trust and faith in this lovefest we call Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fzhvr/i_believe_lucidending_was_fiction_ama_sorry/

Regardless of whether LucidEnding is legit or not, can we stop parading around this stupid quote. It makes Redditors no better than Christian fundamentalists who want to post John 3:16 and other select Bible soundbites all over the place...

tl;dr: LucidEnding's quote makes no sense--please stop treating it like some kind of life scripture.

Another thing is ""Horse Chicks"" have their own circle of friends who either own or ride horses. In addition they're most likely looking for a partner in life who can buy them their very own stud farm, nothing less will do.

If I see an often violent ex con on parole shrug off an argument, it wont make me instantly trust him fully with people i care about.

If i see an ex westboro baptist being a kind, good, moral person, it wont change my mind about the church. they have not all become this.

why see one good action and change one's thought about humanity?

Humanity, as a whole, is nasty and brutish. there are diamonds in the rough, but that doesnt give one reason to trust humanity again. murder, violence, apathy, hatred, bigotry, and war. War never changes, no matter how many times we do it. Just because one man walks a good road doesnt mean this wasteland is any different. "	t5_2r6cf	True

I think of the years that have passed, where I was then, etc.. This year I also got a new job offer on my birthday, which ended up giving me anxiety for some strange reason. I think it was the fact that it happened on the day that I usually look deep within myself and judge if where I am in my life is where I thought I'd be.

I would stay up really late and just go through all these scenarios and try to scale down life to its simplest forms and try to pinpoint the things that truly mattered. I remember thinking that someday the answer would just come to me. I still spend times thinking about it now, but nowhere near as how often I used to as a kid. This was like 6th or 5th grade mainly, but I did it before then too. I'm just wondering if it was odd to do so as a kid and at that age.	t5_2r6cf	True
