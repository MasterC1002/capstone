[Repost due to brigade]	Townsley	152	103	56	"Those that are regulars here know that reddit backs the sale of assault rifles and explosives on reddit without supervision.  In my last post, I took a snapshot of 100 gun transactions on reddit (about a week's worth) and found 29 sales related to assault rifles (as defined by the single characteristic test), 16 lbs of explosive powder (like the type used in the Boston Bombing), and thousands of rounds of [ammuntion exchanging hands,](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1cryne/gun_trafficking_on_reddit_out_of_the_last_100/) with many redditors preferring to conduct transactions ""face-to-face"" without background checks. 

There are a multitude of transactions in which assault rifles and other guns are sold by anarchists/libertarians using the [anonymous bitcoin payment system.](http://en.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1ap7ln/sorry_about_that_heres_the_assault_rifle_you_can/)  We have frequently contacted the reddit admins about these claims, and have not received a word in reply.  Meanwhile, the volume of these transactions has increased tremendously even since the fall of last year. 

But it came as a surprise to me when I found out today that for over two years and running reddit also directly granted express written permission to stamp the reddit logo on assault rifles.  

Here are pictures of some of the reddit assault rifles:

I would be interested to know which brilliant legal mind authorized this.  So far, 93 assault rifle receivers have been made bearing the reddit logo.  The receiver is colloquially known as the ""lower"" and is the part of the assault rifle [considered the actual firearm by the ATF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(firearms).  

Building an assault rifle is likely easier than putting together a lot of Ikea furniture, and redditors do it because they can shave the  cost of it to - $400-$600 - the cost of some handguns.  In February of 2011, one redditor asked for, and received, permission from reddit admins to emblazen the logo on 39 assault rifles in the first batch received from a gun maker in Arizona called Double Diamond Law Enforcement Supply.  But Double Diamond was slow to deliver on the order, and part way through the process demanded that the redditor receive permission from reddit in order to make the assault rifle receivers.  

At that point, extensive negotiations took place between one or two Double Diamond employees (Jon Beaudry and Stuart Seymour), one redditor (/u/r1b4z01d), and Condé Nast. /u/r1b4z01d complained that ""Once we were all ready to pay they asked for permission to use the logo then I had to deal with convincing Condé Nast Digital to allow us to use the logo on the gun."" [Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/SNvU5eZ.png) [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/jcyb5/check_out_my_new_reddit_ar15_lower/c2b8o7d).  But apparently he was able to convince Condé Nast relatively easily, because he stated ""I do have written permission from Conde Nast."" [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nlDjYPP.png) [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/j7rsy/our_reddit_ar15s_have_finally_shipped/c2a373f).

That batch of assault rifles shipped to 39 redditors months later.  The next batch of 21 assault rifles was organized in September of 2011 and shipped around January of 2012 (here's the [link to the sign up thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/kp1nf/order_your_reddit_lowers_now/c2qb9rf).  The third batch was organized by a redditor who founded a subreddit mere days after Sandy Hook to promote assault rifle and high capacity mag proliferation on reddit.  Many of their fanatical gun owners form picket lines on reddit and comb the new queues and downvote and comment, [send death threats](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/19j7ql/ok/), and stalk redditors [daily for months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1cd8gk/grcs_nomination_stalker_of_the_year_award_todays/)

The larger concern is that redditors have killed themselves, and [continue to kill themselves using guns](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/vacds/my_best_friend_and_our_fellow_gunnitor_ammojunkie/).  Reddit gun owners are largely comprised of young, rural, white males who are lonely and suffer from a combustible mix of depression and abuse of alcohol and other substances.  None of them, including the young reddit admins, have exhibited an appreciable understanding of the science on either suicidal or homicidal impulse.  

But Harvard shows that [where there are more guns there are more homicides and suicides.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/)

[An extensive writeup on gun suicide can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/16t9fn/gun_suicide/)  *Impulse* is the desire to commit suicide, and how that impulse is acted upon is what scientists describe as the *means* (e.g. using a gun). Guns allow redditors to act quickly on that impulse ('The Means Matter Theory'), and also prevent survival whereas other means are more difficult or time consuming.  But if you *survive* for the duration of the impulse, 90% [will not commit suicide again.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/)

A researcher from Harvard speculated that ""[p]erhaps it is not the presence of firearms, per se, but something about rural life … a character trait (such as self-reliance and an inclination to “go it alone”) that may be associated both with firearm ownership and suicide and it is this trait, [not the presence of the gun, that leads to the association.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/16t9fn/gun_suicide/)

In other words, Harvard is saying the Tea Party/libertarian ideology is so toxic that it is killing the people who subscribe to it. 

  Whatever the case may be, if that gun owner fits the criteria above and is *also* a veteran, the suicide rate is astronomical.  Suffice it to say, many of those purchasing assault rifles today are the hundreds of thousands of lonely and depressed young veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and finding commonality by talking about guns on reddit.

This of course doesn't even begin to address firearm homicide or other crimes commited with guns.  In other posts, I have directed reddit's attention to both the legal (it does not qualify for the protections that gun makers and gun stores receive) and moral obligations it owes (not participating in the killing of its users and protecting the general public from unlawfully sold guns obtained on reddit).  

In response, the usual comments from fanatical gun owners note that some interstate transactions are shipped to Federal Firearm Licensees and that some undergo background checks. But redditors can easily arrange the transactions for themselves, and cross a state line and conduct a private sale because the sellers are not checking state identification (of course, they will swear otherwise).  In addition the background check issue is really a distraction from whether reddit should be in the business of trafficking guns at all.

But as reddit found out when it made the front page of the Huffington Post, one assault rifle with the reddit logo *has already* been sold in a [face to face transaction without a background check](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/21/reddit-x---x--x-x-gun-reddit-logo_n_2736684.html
).

At that time, neither reddit or Condé Nast came forward to clarify that they *expressly* endorsed the sale of assault rifles baring the reddit logo.  Nor did they comment on Condé Nast's endorsement of the subreddit where hundreds of gun transactions are taking place each month, unmonitored and unsupervised by either Condé Nast or reddit.  That's a shame.  Because as Harvard research shows, [more guns mean more homicides](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/).  And they certainly don't seem to care that they are participating in a secondary market where [gun owners have shot 4.5 million people and managed to kill 1.34 million in only 45 years.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/mark-shields/pbs-commentator-mark-shields-says-more-killed-guns/)

But reddit and Condé Nast do present a shining example of America's thoughtless gun culture.  It seems that as always, someone has to die by homicide, suicide, or accident before some thought is given to the secondary gun market on reddit and elsewhere.  Myself and other concerned redditors report it every day in /r/gunsarecool, and don't want to see the reddit alien on a gun next to a pool of blood and an outstretched hand.  Unfortunately, reddit has literally given it's corporate stamp of approval on assault rifles and high capacity magazines in America.

Even innocuous posts about the Marx Brothers and Duck Soup get downvoted by the gun extremists. What they are attempting to do is to create in our minds a negative association with even discussing gun control. Even the mere discussion of such matters is a threat to them, and they want to discourage it.

This behavior is cowardice and, much to their chagrin, a Camusian encouragement to continue regardless of futility. Our insistence upon pushing the boulder up the hill, despite the inevitable avalanche of downvotes, has become the point of the struggle in this community. I shake my fist at the heavens and continue posting, continue participating. Their sad, misguided attempts to deride, obfuscate, and otherwise deride everything on this subreddit underscore their inability to truly compete in the marketplace of ideas.

&gt; Phillip Peterson, a gun dealer in Indiana and the **author of “Gun Digest Buyer’s Guide to Assault Weapons” (2008)**, said he had fought with his publishers over the use of the term in the title, knowing that it would only draw the ire of the gun industry.

&gt; After the passage of the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons, Mr. Peterson said, the gun industry “moved to shame or ridicule” anyone who used “assault weapon” to describe anything other than firearms capable of full automatic fire.

... 

&gt; “The popularly held idea that the term ‘assault weapon’ originated with antigun activists, media or politicians is wrong,” Mr. Peterson wrote. “**The term was first adopted by the manufacturers, wholesalers, importers and dealers in the American firearms industry to stimulate sales of certain firearms that did not have an appearance that was familiar to many firearm owners.** The manufacturers and gun writers of the day needed a catchy name to identify this new type of gun.”

In my last post, I took a snapshot of 100 gun transactions on reddit (about a week's worth) and found 29 sales related to assault rifles (as defined by the single characteristic test), 16 lbs of explosive powder (like the type used in the Boston Bombing), and thousands of rounds of [ammuntion exchanging hands,](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1cryne/gun_trafficking_on_reddit_out_of_the_last_100/) with many redditors preferring to conduct transactions ""face-to-face"" without background checks. 

There are a multitude of transactions in which assault rifles and other guns are sold by anarchists/libertarians using the [anonymous bitcoin payment system.](http://en.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1ap7ln/sorry_about_that_heres_the_assault_rifle_you_can/)  We have frequently contacted the reddit admins about these claims, and have not received a word in reply.  Meanwhile, the volume of these transactions has increased tremendously even since the fall of last year. 

But it came as a surprise to me when I found out today that for over two years and running Condé Nast also directly granted express written permission for its wholly owned subsidiary reddit (Condé Nast owns 100% of reddit stock and shed it into [it's own corporation in 2011 - before all of this took place)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast_Publications) to stamp the reddit logo on assault rifles.  

Here are pictures of some of the Condé Nast assault rifles:

I would be interested to know which brilliant legal mind at Condé Nast authorized this.  So far, 93 assault rifle receivers have been made bearing the reddit logo.  The receiver is colloquially known as the ""lower"" and is the part of the assault rifle [considered the actual firearm by the ATF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(firearms).  

Building an assault rifle is likely easier than putting together a lot of Ikea furniture, and redditors do it because they can shave the  cost of it to - $400-$600 - the cost of some handguns.  In February of 2011, one redditor asked for, and received permission, from reddit admins to emblazen the logo on 39 assault rifles in the first batch received from a gun maker in Arizona called Double Diamond Law Enforcement Supply.  But Double Diamond was slow to deliver on the order, and part way through the process demanded that the redditor receive permission from Condé Nast in order to make the assault rifle receivers.  

At that point, extensive negotiations took place between one or two Double Diamond employees (Jon Beaudry and Stuart Seymour), one redditor (/u/r1b4z01d), and Condé Nast. /u/r1b4z01d complained that ""Once we were all ready to pay they asked for permission to use the logo then I had to deal with convincing Condé Nast Digital to allow us to use the logo on the gun."" [Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/SNvU5eZ.png) [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/jcyb5/check_out_my_new_reddit_ar15_lower/c2b8o7d).  But apparently he was able to convince Condé Nast relatively easily, because he stated ""I do have written permission from Conde Nast."" [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/nlDjYPP.png) [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/j7rsy/our_reddit_ar15s_have_finally_shipped/c2a373f).

That batch of assault rifles shipped to 39 redditors months later.  The next batch of 21 assault rifles was organized in September of 2011 and shipped around January of 2012 (here's the [link to the sign up thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/kp1nf/order_your_reddit_lowers_now/c2qb9rf).  The third batch was organized by a redditor who founded a subreddit mere days after Sandy Hook to promote assault rifle and high capacity mag proliferation on reddit.  Some of their fanatical gun owners form picket lines on reddit and comb the new queues and downvote and comment, [send death threats](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/19j7ql/ok/), and stalk redditors [daily for months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1cd8gk/grcs_nomination_stalker_of_the_year_award_todays/)

The larger concern is that redditors have killed themselves, and [continue to kill themselves using guns](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/vacds/my_best_friend_and_our_fellow_gunnitor_ammojunkie/).  Reddit gun owners are largely comprised of young, rural, white, males who are lonely and suffer from a combustible mix of depression and abuse of alcohol and other substances.  None of them, including the young reddit admins, have exhibited an appreciable understanding of the science on suicidal impulse.  

[An extensive writeup on gun suicide can be found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/16t9fn/gun_suicide/)  *Impulse* is the desire to commit suicide, and how that impulse is acted upon is what scientists describe as the *means* (e.g. using a gun). Guns allow redditors to act quickly on that impulse ('The Means Matter Theory'), and also prevent survival whereas other means are more difficult or time consuming.  But if you *survive* for the duration of the impulse, 90% [will not commit suicide again.](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/)

A researcher from Harvard speculated that ""[p]erhaps it is not the presence of firearms, per se, but something about rural life … a character trait (such as self-reliance and an inclination to “go it alone”) that may be associated both with firearm ownership and suicide and it is this trait, [not the presence of the gun, that leads to the association.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/16t9fn/gun_suicide/)  Whatever the case may be, if that gun owner fits the criteria above and is *also* a veteran, the suicide rate is astronomical.  Suffice it to say, many of those purchasing assault rifles today are the hundreds of thousands of lonely and depressed young veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and finding commonality by talking about guns on reddit.

This of course doesn't even begin to address firearm homicide or other crimes commited with guns.  In other posts, I have directed reddit's attention to both the legal (it does not qualify for the protections that gun makers and gun stores receive) and moral obligations it owes (not participating in the killing of its users and protecting the general public from unlawfully sold guns obtained on reddit).  

In response, the usual comments from fanatical gun owners note that some interstate transactions are shipped to Federal Firearm Licensees and that some undergo background checks. But redditors can easily arrange the transactions for themselves, and cross a state line and conduct a private sale because the sellers are not checking state identification (of course, they will swear otherwise).  In addition the background check issue is really a distraction from whether Condé Nast and reddit should be in the business of trafficking guns at all.

But as reddit found out when it made the front page of the Huffington Post, one assault rifle with the reddit logo *has already* been sold in a [face to face transaction without a background check](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/21/reddit-x---x--x-x-gun-reddit-logo_n_2736684.html
).

At that time, neither reddit or Condé Nast came forward to clarify that they *expressly* endorsed the sale of assault rifles baring the reddit logo.  Nor did they comment on Condé Nast's endorsement of the subreddit where hundreds of gun transactions are taking place each month, unmonitored and unsupervised by either Condé Nast or reddit.  That's a shame.  Because as Harvard research shows, [more guns mean more homicides](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/).  And they certainly don't seem to care that they are participating in a secondary market where 100,000 people are shot every year and more than 400,000 gun crimes are committed.  

But reddit and Condé Nast do present a shining example of America's thoughtless gun culture.  It seems that as always, someone has to die by homicide, suicide, or accident before some thought is given to the secondary gun market on reddit and elsewhere.  But myself and other concerned redditors report it every day in /r/gunsarecool, and don't want to see the reddit alien on a gun next to a pool of blood and an outstretched hand.  Unfortunately, Condé Nast has literally given it's corporate stamp of approval on assault rifles and high capacity magazines in America.

1366508800.0	1cryne	Gun trafficking on reddit. Out of the last 100 posts, assault rifle sales, high cap mags, ammo, and gun powder dominate.	Townsley	110	81	23	"After the recent stunning [NY Times' expose of Armlist.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1cirf2/busted_the_new_york_times_just_blew_the_lid_off/), a website that like reddit does not supervise arms trafficking, I decided to take a quick look at gun trafficking on /r/gunsforsale. (Note redditor and Virginia Tech survivor Colin Goddard, who yesterday appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, chimed in to support background checks).

Like in Armslist's wrongful death suit, reddit would not be shielded from liability by laws that protect licensed arms dealers or manufacturers if a redditor negligently sold a gun to a criminal or killed himself with one that was unlawfully purchased, which is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of unregulated sales.  

At least, it was a reasonably foreseeable consequence to the owners of Craigslist, which realized the danger of providing an unstructured environment for interstate arms trafficking and completely banned them. Amazon and EBay obviously realize this and take strict precautions to regulate transactions that take place there - not only because that is the moral thing to do in that they don't want their customers getting killed - but it is the *reasonable* thing for a website owner to do when interstate gun sales are at issue.

Reddit's attorney does not practice second amendment tort law or criminal law, and she is not admitted to practice in the 29 of the 30 jurisdictions in which reddit could be sued based solely on these last 100 posts alone, nor is she familiar with the widely varying local laws that are being called into play by each transaction at issue.

This post serves not only to educate our community, but also to educate her as well as to provide notice to the admins that these transactions are taking place.  On at least one other occasion, each admin was personally private messaged about other gun sales taking place on reddit, including one internet FFL who was attempting to sell 8 assault rifles on reddit.  His FFL license is available to admins upon request.

This post will also be sent to the admins using the reddit contact form with the title ""There is unsupervised gun trafficking taking place on reddit"".  And if we become aware of a shooting, whether murder or attempted murder, suicide or accidental shooting from a gun that has been sold on reddit we will forward this post as well as the other information we have to reddit's opposing counsel in the hopes that it will become an exhibit to ensure that reddit will fully compensate the victim of its willful neglect.

The reddit admins have been aware of this danger for a long time and have done nothing to stop it, and the killing that takes place from it is completely foreseeable and preventable.  Two assault rifles have been sold on reddit bearing the reddit logo, one of which was sold out of the trunk of a car in a face to face transaction without a background check.  That face to face transaction actually made the national news when the Huffington Post picked up the story.  One anarcho-libertarian has even tried to sell an assault rifle using the anonymous bitcoin payment system.  

Reddit gun sales have been steadily increasing as radicalized users become aware of the gun proliferation taking place here.  I would say in the last 7 months alone, in my own anecdotal opinion and without resorting to hyperbole, they have increased from 10-20 times the volume of September 2012.

Just like the Times article, many of the ads on reddit expressly call for ""face to face transactions"" which allow the users to exchange guns for cash without having to check IDs.  Many also express a willingness to drive long distances, a worrying development that I haven't seen in the ads before.  In other words, since the gun seller is not checking IDs, the buyer could just cross the border into the neighboring state to purchase the murder weapon there.

Of course, every seller will totally swear to using telepathy on the buyer to see if they are felons first, or that they will only ship to a FFL, but by and large reddit is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off.  Literally.

Here are the highlights of only the last 100 posts: 

* **16 lbs of gun powder for sale**, no background check required, just like that used in the Boston Marathon bombing.  

* Assault rifle transactions *dominated* the sales, composing 29 of the posts, of those 9 high powered assault rifles were completed.  Combined, those sales outnumbered sales of shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, reloading equipment, sights, and mags.

* Number of high cap mags for sale: 65

* Number of rounds available for purchase without a background check: 6,179

* Hand guns: 13

* Shotguns: 2

* Hunting rifles: 5

* Lasers, scopes, sights: 6,  Reloading Equipment: 3, Triggers: 1.

* Just like in the Times article, **it appears that FFLs are using reddit to conduct arms transactions in volume and may be posing as private sellers**.  This can be inferred from the volume of transactions by certain users, and the types of weapons and components they are selling.

Most of the posts are from rural gun owners, even those posting in blue states.  However, reddit's record keeping is so poor that it is impossible to completely verify.  Here is a handy [graph showing gun ownership vs gun deaths by state.](http://www.motherjones.com/files/ownership-death630.png)  Here is the Harvard data [backing that up](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/guns-and-death/)

Now, compare that graph with [this chart of the breakdown of transactions per state](http://i.imgur.com/C5aFrDT.png) (with red vs blue states sorted out) for an understanding of where and how gun violence occurs due to transactions like these on reddit. Thanks to /u/Im_gumby_damnit for creating this breakdown as well as reporting the other graph above.

1366466236.0	1cqo7x	Do you know the story of Columbine's Evan Todd?	Townsley	75	46	18	"Evan is a 255 lb redneck Columbine football player who survived the massacre in the library. Recently he wrote a letter to Obama that was touted by the gun lobby in response to the proposed legislation. 

Here he is on [Glenn Beck's The Blaze](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/19/being-shot-gave-this-columbine-survivor-strong-views-on-gun-control-heres-why-he-opposes-more-restrictions/) where they proudly tout that he was shot and you can see a picture of his smug, shit eating grin. ""But Townsley,"" you might be asking yourself, ""I know you hate country-folk who mindlessly spew paper thin talking points, but you should give him some credit for getting shot and having an opinion.""

Normally (unlike the gun lobby) I might. But I wanted to find some original content today that you might not find anywhere else, and when I started digging the first thing I found is that he wasn't shot at all. He was hit by wood splinters from a gunshot and escaped relatively [unscathed.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre)

But The Blaze lying to the general public is nothing knew, what struck me is the result of a *book search* I did on Evan.  Evan was a bully.  Here is what the piece of shit said about Eric and Dylan:

""Columbine is a clean, good place, except for those rejects. Sure we teased them. But what do you expect with kids who come to school with weird hairdos and horns on their hats? It's not just jocks; the whole school's disgusted with them. They're a bunch of homos. . . . If you want to get rid of someone, usually you tease 'em. So the whole school would call them [homos](http://goo.gl/aIBYh).""

So Evan played his own role in causing Columbine. 

For background, Dylan and Eric bought all of their guns from private sellers at the Tanner Gun Show, specifically asking whether the seller was licensed or not to avoid the 4473 to exploit the gun show loophole. That's how they purchased the Tec-9 with 30 round high cap mag. [All cash, no checks, and using a straw that the dealers obviously knew about.](http://dylanklebold.com/columbine-shooting-facts/all-guns-originally-came-from-the-tanner-gun-show/)

Background checks on private sales, toughening sanctions on straw purchasers, and limits on mags and assault weapons were all offered in the recent legislation, and combined could have prevented the massacre entirely or drastically reduced the devastation.  

But do you think a prick like Evan cares? Of course not. Just as he thoughtlessly tortured Eric and Dylan, he continues unthinkingly even as those defective loopholes resulted in a bunch of his classmates dying and him nearly getting killed. Yet the dumb redneck still can't make the connection. 

To me, this story symbolizes the entire gun nut universe in a nut shell. "	t5_2uvah	True

1364122021.0	1awpyy	The logical fallacy of false equivalency.	Townsley	90	65	3	"**Why am I here?**   You are a person who used an NRA talking point in the form of a false equivalency.

**So?  What is a false equivalency?** It is a logical fallacy. 

**You are a libtard/pinko/homo, why should I listen to you?** Logic rules remain the same wherever you fall on the political spectrum.  Even after showing gun owners the Wikipedia entry, they will continue to use it immediately afterwards and cling to it desperately.  That is why this was created.

**What is the definition of false equivalency?** “False equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none.” [Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence)

**I still don’t believe you. What is the structure of the argument?** If A is the set of c and d, and B is the set of d and e, then since they both contain d, A and B are equal. Id.

**That doesn’t make sense to me.  Why does my argument look nonsensical to people who aren’t supporters of my position?**
Here is how your argument appears to people without a gun proliferation agenda:

Nuclear weapons explode (c) but are still just tools (d).  Guns are merely tools (d) that shoot people (e).  Since they are both (d) tools they are both equivalent.  Because they are merely (d) tools, nuclear weapons should be treated the same as guns under the Second Amendment, and citizens should be allowed to conceal carry them into schools, courthouses, or government buildings.

**Well that’s a stupid argument, what are other kinds of false equivalencies that gun owners use?**

The variations are endless, but here are some common ones, *all* of which have actually been used on reddit:

-Guns and alcohol are equivalent, because they both ______

-Guns and cars are equivalent, because they both ______

-Guns and knives are equivalent, because they both ______

-Guns and bleach are equivalent, because they both ______

-Guns and fists are equivalent, because they both ______

-Guns are equivalent to soda, because they both ______

-Gun and stamp collecting are equivalent, because they both _____

-Guns and [banana cream pie are equivalent, because they both____](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/1jq17q/boston_bomber_tamerlan_tsarnaev_was_concerned/cbh6k1x)

-Guns and swimming pools are equivalent, because they both _____

-Guns and frying pans are equivalent, because they both _____

-Guns and _______ are equivalent, because they both _____

**And those are all false equivalencies?**  Yes.

**Are you sure?** *Yes.* 

**Really? Because I would really like that to be not true.  Everyone in /r/guns uses them constantly, and they get tons and tons of upvotes for it! Doesn’t that mean they are even a little right?** No.  Justin Bieber is pretty popular within his bubble, doesn’t mean it makes sense to people viewing it from the outside.

**Can you make the logical fallacy appear absurd in a different way?** Sure.  Imagine cars are just as legal as they are now, resulting in 33,000 traffic fatalities each year.  Now, imagine guns are completely banned and there are zero deaths from their use each year. Would the argument that guns are exactly equivalent to soda sway people to change the law?

If our hypothetical government body could pass a law that instantly implemented the current United States gun proliferation laws while simultaneously handing out 270,000,000 guns to the civilian population, would they do it based upon the fact that obesity is also a problem in the United States so we shouldn't worry about people being shot?

Considering the fact that 30,000 people would then be killed each year and 100,000 wounded, the answer is likely no.  And they would certainly not do so under the pretense that soda and firearms should be treated equivalently.  Or cars.  This example applies to each of the false equivalencies given above.  The argument is patently absurd.

**Why has this been downvoted a million times?** Because there are few good arguments for guns in our society so taking away a popular one, however incorrect it may be, further weakens the talking points.  We also only send pro-gun types here to view this and they are not particularly happy to learn that their father was wrong when they taught them this false equivalency or that they have been using a really stupid argument around their loved ones unchecked for most of their lives.  

They may also be embarrassed to learn that their loved ones may already know this and are just pretending to agree with them.

**What do you think about gun control?** The ability to use logic and to correctly reason should be a basic skill for everyone, but is essential for those who carry lethal weapons. Gun owners should have to complete the following sentence before purchasing a gun to show that they can perform basic reasoning: Comparing guns to ________ is a false equivalence because __________. 

**BEFORE POSTING PLEASE READ: This thread is being used to elevate the discourse on reddit by eliminating the use of false equivalencies.  All posts will be removed and risk a ban. Thanks!**

Yesterday, he posted a [picture of himself mass downvoting](http://i.imgur.com/hGVpovU.jpg) the entire new queue in /r/gunsarecool - with a healthy 60 or so downvotes for me alone.  

Then he started [making threats of sending some sort of PMs about me to others.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1hqaaj/townsley_throws_a_fit_at_being_accused_of_gay/cawvpk5?context=9)  I couldn't figure out what he was talking about and when I sent him a PM asking what he meant, he wouldn't tell me.  

So then I had to go back and dig through nearly 6 months of my history and saw something that I had completely forgotten - he had doxxed a gun nut redditor and sent that doxx to me unsolicited.  Had he not gone nuts yesterday there is no way I would ever have remembered that as it was so long ago, but when I saw the PMs I reported it to the admins.

I have told every mod in /r/gunsarecool that I would report them myself if I see them doxxing anyone, and that goes for everyone else as well.

- Claims that Tiller's killing was an accident on Tiller's part

""Tiller's killing was an accident on Tiller's part. He packed heat all the time. What happened is that even he felt safe in church. Little did he expect that some people don't care!

While Tiller was passing out the programs the shooter beat him to the draw.

Nothing more to it than that. A fair killing in the days before dueling was abolished.

Should we adjust our laws to bring back those days someone like Tiller would certainly be more careful. ""

- Thinks All liberals love bombers

- Opening calls for Fascist tactics like jailing politcal groups deem undesirable by him, namely liberals

""So typical of the Left to always think first of killing people they disagree with.

Really, this nation is not safe as long as there's a single leftwinger free to walk the streets.

I don't care how many prisons it takes, we've got to build them to house these people until they are no longer around to endanger us. ""

1368236051.0	1e3tcs	Dumbest Redditor of the Year Nomination, 2013: Kody Michael Kinzie-Zinn [Update and Wrapup Thread: He has actually been arrested three times - he was arrested *before this* for unlawful possesion of firearms in his car.]	Townsley	69	47	9	"Kody Michael Kinzie-Zinn is a reddit gun nut and doomsday prepper who was arrested with a loaded m4-type assault rifle, combat shotgun, three pistols, a taser, two high capacity magazines, survivalist gear, a gas mask, and a small amount of marijuana.  He has been arrested three times.  

Once for felony theft, once during a traffic stop in Oregon in which three handguns were found in the passenger compartment and the assault rifle and shotgun in the trunk, and once on the day before Christmas for the same thing this past year.  It really blows my mind that he was already arrested for possession on carrying these five guns in his car prior to his current arrest for having the same five guns in his car.   


Kinzie illegally lived with the assault rifle in Los Angeles, and transported his guns with him to and from his original home in Oregon.  On December 24th, at about the same time as an ex-felon was ambushing and killing firemen with a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle 2,000 miles away, he either stopped or continued to drive in Kern County while loading a magazine.  Someone spotted him loading it (which is illegal if you don't have a permit) while he was in his car and called 911.  

Kinzie disputes that he was loading the magazine, saying that he was ""unloading it"".  Sure.  Anyway, his lawyer managed to delay the proceedings until Kody ran out of money to pay him.  The lawyer then quit.  Prior to all of this, Kinzie was arrested in 2005 for felony theft back in Oregon.  In February of 2013 he launched a website to solicit money for his legal defense.  He states on it that ""I have a clean criminal record"" and does not mention his felony rap sheet nor his prior arrests for  unlawful possession of the handguns.

He was charged with three felonies: one count possession of an assault rifle, and one count for each high capacity magazine.  One charge alone, unlawful possesion of an assault rifle carries a sentence of 15 years.  He was also charged with two misdemeanors as well.  The prosecutor offered him a plea deal of 1 year imprisonment and work release.  Kinzie declined the deal.

On May 7th, his motion to dismiss the case was dismissed by the judge.  He now heads to trial and the prosecutor has withdrawn the deal.  Prosecutors often give their best deal up front on a take it or leave it basis, so Kinzie is heading to trial at the mercy of the prosecutor.

We drove from our home in Texas to Washington D.C. saw the sights and then drove down to Orlando to go to Disney World before driving back home. 

On the way from Washington D.C. to Orlando, we swung by Virginia Beach where an old friend of my dad's from the Air Force Civil Service was now living. We went over to my dad's friend's house for dinner. During dinner my little brother, who was three at the time, needed to use the bathroom so my parents asked me to go with him. 

After he went I decided to go ahead and use the bathroom too. He started being a nosy little boy and peaking into cabinets and the laundry hamper. In the laundry hamper he found something and started poking around with it. 

Once I finished using the bathroom, I went over to see what he was messing with. There was a black semi-automatic pistol in the hamper. He picked it up and handed it to me. Upon taking it I was shocked at how heavy it was and a voice inside my head said: ""this isn't right, a toy gun shouldn't be this heavy."" 

I quickly put the gun back and dragged my brother out of the bathroom. I went up to my parents and said ""There's something weird in the bathroom"", my parents looked confused at me and then suddenly a light went off in my dad's friend and he said something along the lines of ""Oh my god, I forgot I put it there."" Jumped up off the couch and ran out of the room presumably to retrieve his handgun.

Everytime I hear about a young child killed by a sibling, I am reminded of how horribly different things could have gone that night had I or my brother had acted a little less prudently or even if it had slipped or was dropped wrong."	t5_2uvah	True

1362494478.0	19pho6	Let's clear something up: Gun-Free Zones are not about keeping people from committing intentional gun violence, like massacres. They're about preventing accidental misfires, discouraging an atmosphere of violence, and lowering the base-rate probability of people being shot.	Jack_Latham	157	134	27	"This is one of those specious arguments the gun fetishists like to make -- that we think a Gun-Free Zone will prevent massacres and intentional/planned/premeditated shootings. I don't think anyone truly believes this -- if they do, they're either looking at relatively small effects (i.e., lowering of basal aggression rate coming from ""Weapons Effect""), or they're grossly misinformed.

No, the gun-free zone is about the prevention of incidental and accidental firings that can injure or kill people. That's what it's about. So when a state like Colorado bans CCW permits on college campuses, they don't believe that this alone will prevent violent crime. Rather, they recognize that a college campus can be a chaotic, crowded environment, and introducing a few dozen lethal firearms in the hands of students is asking for accidental firings and possibly ""heat-of-the-moment"" shootings. 

So we can abandon this fiction that a gun-free zone is about premeditated violence, yes? Because, as the gun fetishists are fond of pointing out, someone who wants to kill people won't be discouraged by a sign that says a place is gun-free."	t5_2uvah	True
