1341254943.0	vxq12	Unemployed in Brooklyn? Want to learn woodworking skills for free?	BrooklynWoods	58	4	15	"I'm with Brooklyn Woods, a free, seven week, full-time course in woodworking preparing individuals for entry-level jobs in custom woodworking, cabinetmaking, and fabrication. Trainees learn the proper use of hand tools, power tools, and woodworking machinery, math and measurement, cabinet construction methods, an introduction to finishing, and installation. (Please note that Brooklyn Woods is not a carpentry program.) 

We are currently recruiting for our next class cycle beginning in September and running through late October, 2012.

We have an 80% job placement rate for graduates of the program.

Minimum eligibility requirements: 21 years old, background in or strong interest in working with tools, laboring experience; good hand and spacial skills. 6th grade math/8th grade reading; physically fit and able to lift 70 lbs. 

**Orientations are held every Wednesday (except the 4th of July this week) at 10:00am sharp in our shop located on the second floor at 125 8th St, between 2nd and 3rd Ave in Brooklyn.** Orientation is open to anyone who wants more information on the program, and lasts for about three hours. You only need to bring a photo ID, and any documentation with your work/income history that might aid you in filling out our application. You will take a very basic reading, math, and reasoning test, and in the following weeks we will conduct interviews with prospective students. 

Brooklyn Woods is a part of Brooklyn Workforce Innovations.

For more information, please call 718-389-3636 and ask for Toby or Jonathan.

**Additional important information.**

Brooklyn Woods and other Brooklyn Workforce Innovations programs are for the unemployed, the under educated, the impoverished, individuals with criminal records, and people with other barriers to employment. If you're like me, a college grad who can't find work, then I'm afraid that this program is not for you.

**Admission to the program is competitive so attend an orientation as soon as possible. You MUST be able to attend the class FULL-TIME. If you have student/child care/other obligations, then we cannot make exceptions for you.**"	t5_2qme3	True
1327023423.0	oo6tl	I got mugged yesterday	mulcahey	55	2	64	"I live on Bergen St, on the border of Prospect and Crown Heights. I was coming home from work on Wednesday morning, about 2:30 AM, when I noticed two people sitting on a stoop a few doors from my building. This stoop is popular with winos in the summertime, and we often share a polite nod/'what's up.' This past Tuesday night/Wed. morning was warm, so there was nothing immediately suspicious about their presence.

As I approached, I realized that these were not my familiar neighborhood lushes (who are in their 40's). These guys appeared to be in their early 20's, or maybe late teens. As I walked past them I noticed that one had a metal cane, which instantly raised my suspicions. Then, across the street, I saw two more guys, one wearing a face mask. I realized, then, what was about to happen.

I quickened my pace, being only a few doors from my place, but one kid ran up behind me. ""Don't say anything,"" he said, motioning with his hand in his coat pocket, ""I've got a gun.""

""No you don't,"" I said, ""Show it to me."" He repeated his claim, but before I could continue, his friend ran up with the cane and started swinging. I tried to block/grab the cane and ended up throwing/falling with him into a car. ""FUCK YOU!"" I yelled. My strategy was to make as much noise as possible and fight them off long enough that they'd have to flee without getting my stuff. This was difficult, as the two guys from across the street had crossed over, and now I was trying to block the cane without leaving myself vulnerable to the other three.

We grappled on the sidewalk for a second, and made our way to my stoop, where I started yelling ""This is my HOUSE!"" repeatedly. Then Cane-o got a really good hit on me, and I went deaf for a second. I was still resisting, but when my hearing came back I heard Cane-o say, ""Yo, this guy wants me to hit him AGAIN!"" He said it in a shocked tone, as if there was something perplexing about this. I wondered what he knew that I didn't, and sure enough, just as he said it, I felt blood running down my forehead. Like, a lot.

I backed into a corner and the others swarmed me and ran my pockets. They pulled out my wallet, phone, and less-interesting stuff. Cane-o kept shouting ""Get his bag! Get his bag!"" but I wouldn't let them, using my body in the corner to block. They were fast and nervous, and after a couple seconds they gave up and ran. Cane-o looked at me, muttered ""Shit"" and took off after them.

I went inside and washed the blood off. I saw several lacerations to the top of my head. The NYPD knocked on my door a minute later and said they had received calls from neighbors in several buildings. They took my statement while an ambulance treated my wound and suggested I go to the ER. I took a cab over to 7th Ave ($7 vs. god-knows-what ambulances charge) and received a single staple to hold the wound together.

All told, this experience doesn't seem very consequential. This sort of thing happens everyday in almost every neighborhood of NY. It's more a matter of statistics than location, and given the number of times my roommates and I have come home late over the past 5 years (we work odd hours), it's kind of amazing that this never happened before. I still love my neighborhood and my block (though I wish it was closer to the train solely for ambulatory reasons). If anyone in the neighborhood feels threatened by a situation ahead of them, though, I suggest turning around and calling a cab. It probably would have saved me a trip to the ER.

Many thanks to my neighbors who called the police. It's truly appreciated.

We would love to have people come out and enjoy some of our wonderful restaurants. Participating restaurants will have a 15% discount on their food menu and/or a specialty dish for $10-15. Bars will do 2 for one cocktails (a couple are doing that with draft beer) and cafes will have a $5 bottomless cup of coffee.
Also, word on the street is that the L train will be shut down that weekend. For that reason, we partnered with Uber (the car service for smartphones). New sign ups get a free ride up to $30 if they head to a participating restaurant and use the promo code ""Bushwick"". Hit up our website www.bushwickrestaurantweek.com or our facebook http://www.facebook.com/BushwickRestaurantWeek for details as they come.
Cheers!

Edit time!!! People were asking about some of the restaurants participating. We have 30 at the moment and more on the way, but here is a taste: Mama Joys, Brooklyn Fire Proof, Mominette, Pine Box Rock Shop, The Narrows, Tandem, Burger It Up, Evergreen Ice Cream ( they are doing $5 bottomless ice cream per visit!!!)

I have been biking in NY and have been a bike delivery guy in the Bushwick / Williamsburg area for upwards of two years now and have never seen the NYPD cracking down so hard. To my knowledge the only ticketed offense that was actively enforced until recently was biking on the sidewalk. 

I have been hearing from multiple other people I know that have also been getting ticketed lately so I just wanted to give you guys a heads up. NYPD has a quota to make and they're looking for reasons to pull over cyclist.

Be careful walking around by the Jefferson L stop. There are 3 kids no older than 15 on bikes riding around grabbing phones and other valuables. They have also been seen asking to use peoples phones and then running off with them.

EDIT: To be clear I didn't hand them my phone they wrestled it out of my hands in a triple attack.  Three kids on bikes each tries to grab your phone at once and rides away.  They come from behind and don't look back so you canno get a positive ID.

We live four blocks from the train station in a well populated area of Brooklyn. It's the 20th ave stop in Bensonhurst.

She was talking on her phone with her headset on (yes I know she should have known better). It seems as if someone followed her from the train although she wasn't aware at all that anyone was behind her. As soon as she got to our block and turned the corner the person ran up behind her, grabbed her purse off her shoulder and pushed her down. 

Unfortunately she didn't get a great look at the guy. He took off running and she was so scared she obviously took off running toward our home. 

It obviously could have been a lot worse, the guy didn't hurt her at all and she was actually wearing some semi-expensive jewelry which he didn't even attempt to get. Most likely it was a punk kid (there are plenty of them hanging around over on 86th street over here).

It sucks because she's lived here her entire life and now she's scared, rightfully so. It just took away so much from her that will take her a long time to get back.

Please ladies, if you are walking at night even if you're in a place you think you are safe keep your headphones away, keep your phone away and just be hyper aware of who is around you. You don't need to talk on the phone or listen to music for a five minute walk. If you don't seem distracted you won't seem like as good of a target to these predators."	t5_2qme3	True

-The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States

Neighbors, 

The revelation of the NSA's PRISM surveillance software is just the latest blow from the Federal Government in the continual attack on our civil liberties. 

We are supposed to be free from fear of illegal search and seizure without a warrant derived from probable cause. From DUI checkpoints, to Stop and Frisk, to forced removal of blood on Tennesee drivers, the 4th Amendment has been trampled time and time again. Well, the news about phone monitoring and PRISM is the anchor which broke the camel's back. 

Some of us are just plain old fed up and we are going to let our displeasures be known. Please join us as we try to educate, inform, engage, and exercise our right and obligation to peacefully protest an ever reaching government which is intent on maintining the status quo of control. 

Our first meeting is Weds night at 8 pm in Washington Sq Park, where we will be structuring, organizing, informing, dyving up tasks and more.  Please join us as we take our inalienable rights back.

Looking forward to meeting you.

*edit: now Sunday am at 1030- closer to the full moon and nicer weather. Bring binoculars if you have them!*

**[PICS](http://imgur.com/a/mamm5#2)**

I'm an environmental educator, and tomorrow is a great day to bring your kids (or yourself) to the beach. It's a full moon tonight- and many thousands of Horseshoe crabs will crawl up the sand to lay their eggs, and then turn around and head back into the bay. Thousands of them will get stranded, the tide receding faster than they can crawl, and will sit around on the shore drying out until they're eaten by birds.
Horseshoe crabs, if you're not aware, [are awesome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crabs). 

You or your kids can spend hours picking them up and walking out into the shallow ankle-deep water to release them. They've been around for half a billion years, so they're like little miniature deities. (that have sex by the full moon and then get stuck in sand)

It'll also be low-tide at 12:00, overcast and a bit sprinkly- so the crowds won't be there, and the bay's ecosystem will be incredibly evident. From shorebirds to small sand snails, portly spider crabs and horseshoe crabs, it'll be a fantastic day to spend time at the beach. 

Spend time with me. I'll be at the plum beach rest stop- if you want to go, let me know and we'll figure out a good time. "	t5_2qme3	True

I'll be making runs from Park Slope to Red Hook at 12:45pm and 5:45pm for the next 2 days at least. PM me if you have anything to donate (hot food is best, given the lack of power) and I'll pick it up.

Also, here's a pretty comprehensive list of volunteer and donation information sent by Councilmember Brad Lander:

The Park Slope Armory shelter (361 15th Street, between 7th &amp; 8th Avenues) needs volunteers who can work at least an 8 hour shift, longer would be great. Shifts start at 8 AM and 8 PM. If they have too many volunteers, you may be turned away, so be prepared for that.

The John Jay High School shelter (237 7th Avenue, between 4th &amp; 5th Streets) needs day, evening, and overnight volunteers this weekend (especially, but not only, people with medical training). You need to be able to dedicate at least 6-8 hours and cannot bring your children.

There is still a huge need for your help in Red Hook (and thank you to everyone who has already volunteered). Here are several opportunities over the weekend:

I am very happy to report that the Office of Emergency Management has set up an office in Red Hook at 402 Van Brunt Street. At 10 AM on Saturday, they are looking for 100 volunteers to assist with cleanup efforts. Please bring tools, work gloves, and be prepared to get a little dirty.

Added Value, the Red Hook community farm (480 Columbia Street, across the street from IKEA) sustained extensive damage during the storm. About 100 volunteers will be working throughout the morning and will need a hot lunch. They are asking any kind souls to bring hot, cooked food to the farm at 1 PM on Saturday. Also, their computers were destroyed by Sandy and the farm would really appreciate a donation of an old computer or smart phone.

Red Hook Initiative has been doing amazing work this week on behalf of this community in need. They would still appreciate volunteers (at 767 Hicks Street) and donations of flashlights, ice, and medical supplies (but no clothes). Call 718-858-6782 for details.

Prospect Park
As you have probably heard, Prospect Park was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy. At the Park's website, you can see chilling photos of some of the 300 downed trees in some of our most cherished parts of the park.

But we all love Prospect Park, and the Prospect Park Alliance is looking to the community for help putting “Broooklyn’s backyard” back together. The park will reopen tomorrow morning for a Walkathon to raise funds for park repairs (some parts of the park will remain closed, while clean up continues). You can sign up to participate in the Walkathon here. Make a donation here.

Here are the details:

RUN: Check-in 8 a.m. • Run 9 a.m. – 10 a.m.
WALK: Check-in 9 a.m. • Walk 10 a.m. – Noon
Enter at 15th Street &amp; Prospect Park West (Bartel Pritchard entrance)
Advanced Registration: $10 for adults, $5 for children under 12 to walk • $25 to run
Day-of Registration: $20 for adults, $10 for children under 12 to walk • $30 to run
For more information, contact Lindsay at (718) 965-6992 or lbernier@prospectpark.org.

My whole family (father, mother, sister, me, and younger brother) will be there for the first week (1st-7th) to vacation. As of now we just found out about 30 minutes ago our apartment my mom got was a scam and she's already paid almost $2000 in payments for it. We'll worry about the money later but as of now we need a place to stay tomorrow morning. We're looking for an apartment for 2-3 people for the month and the rest of us can sleep on the ground for the week. If you know anyone or can do anything to help please let us know. We were supposed to be in the financial district as close to Joffrey as we can, but we'll take anything close right now. We can pay you for the apartment for sure, we just need a place to stay.

The scam was over craigslist, [here](http://for-rent-in.net/index.html) is the scammers website they used.

1367365285.0	1dg2qg	The woes of apartment hunting in Brooklyn. It's been a while, any redditors have positive experience with brokers/agents?	cactuspickle	26	2	73	"I searched and didn't seem to find any recent threads (within the past year) on apartment hunting. Yes, I've read a lot. No I'm not moving here from out of state and hoping for an unrealistic apartment. However, all of the brokerage office have reviews on yelp and similar sites, but I trust the opinion of a fellow redditor much more than that of some guy claiming he found his dream 3BR for $700/month with no fee through rapid realty.

Speaking of RR, it seems like they have overwhelmingly negative reviews. Anyone else to avoid? (Personally, I had a terrible experience with Williamsburg Realty on Driggs and N7th). Any management companies you know of in the Williamsburg/Greenpoint/E Williamsburg area that are worth looking into?

I'm in the process of looking for a June 1 move-in date in the Greenpoint/Williamsburg/E Williamsburg area, ideally sub-$1800 for a 1BR. Thanks!

**EDIT: Updating with some of the good info for those too lazy to read all the comments:**

* It is absolutely possible to find a place without a broker fee. Scour the by-owner section of craigslist and be ready to jump at a moment's notice. In the two days since this post, I've been shown 3 places without fees for under $1,800 all within walking distance of an L stop west of Jefferson.
* Redditors have had bad experiences with: Rapid Realty,  Apple G Real Estate, Myspace, RS Bracha, Homewood Gardens, and Triumph Property Group
* 95% of apartments are open listings. That means anyone with a real-estate license can show the place. If a broker asks for more than one-month fee for a place and you haven't signed anything, either negotiate, or ask another broker to show you the place for a lower fee. 10, 12, or 15% fees should only apply to exclusive listings (the other 5% of places)
* Many people suggest walking the streets of the neighborhood you want to be in and looking for ""for rent"" signs, but I've been doing this while walking my dog for the last three weeks, and haven't seen a single sign. YMMV. "	t5_2qme3	True

""By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.""— Benjamin Franklin




//////// FACTS ABOUT IRENE //////////

• Caused $15 billion dollars in damage

• Killed 47 people in the USA




///////// FACTS ABOUT SANDY ///////////

• Sandy's Current death toll is at 48

• On Saturday, Sandy became the largest storm in recorded Atlantic basin history, with a diameter of gale force winds of over 1000 miles.

• Upon landfall, Irene was a weakening storm. On the other hand, besides the fact that Sandy is expected to be stronger than Irene at landfall, Sandy will still be strengthening.

• As a result of Sandy’s tremendous size and strength, a National Weather Service analysis has rated the storm’s wave/surge destructive potential at 5.7 on a 6.0 scale. This is roughly equivalent to some of the most destructive hurricanes in recorded history
 


//////////// PREPARATION //////////////

Stay indoors during the hurricane and away from windows and glass doors
Keep all your electronics charged and plugged in. (cell phones, laptops ,rechargeable batteries, tablet ..etc)

Turn down the temperature on your freezer and refrigerator as low as possible. 

This will buy you more time in the event of a power loss. 24 to 48 hours before will cool the food. Avoid opening them whenever possible. If you are evacuating, probably unnecessary.

Download an application to your smartphone that can notify people where you are, and if you need help or are safe. The Red Cross has a Hurricane App available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. A First Aid app is also available.
If you have a generator, do NOT run it inside or near the house. But make sure you have fuel to run it.

Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.

Make sure your car has fuel.

Stay off roads as much as possible

Copies of your important documents in a waterproof and portable container (insurance cards, photo IDs, etc.)

A list of medications you take, why you take them, and their dosages
Doctors’ names and phone numbers

Use flashlights instead of candles

Whistle, Multipurpose tool

It may sound strange, but do your laundry, dishes, and take a shower. Why? Because if you lose power, having as much clean as possible will make a big difference.

Avoid using the phone except for serious emergencies.

Know your surroundings and whether your home is in a flood prone area.

Determine where you would go — and how you would get there — if you were ordered to evacuate

Listen to the radio or TV for information

Secure your home, close storm shutters, and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors

Huge items must even be secured in big storms. An engine block was found 40 or 50 feet up in a pine tree in the Homestead area after Andrew. Don't think that something is too big to be moved by the wind.

Have enough food that you can eat without cooking (because you may lose power) for 4-5 days suggested items including: canned meats, canned or dried fruits, canned vegetables, canned juice, peanut butter, jelly, salt-free crackers, energy/protein bars, trail mix/nuts, dry cereal, cookies or other comfort food.

Make extra ice, bag it - this will be useful to use and to keep the freezer cold.

Have enough water for 4-5 days, One gallon of drinking water per person per day

Ensure a supply of water for sanitary purpose such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water

Know power safety - avoid downed lines

Know food safety - what is good and for how long.

Water treatment - whether water needs to be boiled or not.

Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it's not contaminated.

Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.

Have a plan. Discuss possible hazards and procedures with your family, decide on a safe room in your house, identify escape routes and memorize emergency numbers

Have extra cash on hand

Regardless of whether or not you are in an evacuation zone, if you live in a high-rise apartment building, be prepared to take shelter on or below the 10th floor.



/////////// IF EVACUATING ////////////////////

Before you evacuate, call at least one person out of state to let them know your plans.

Leave a note to say where you are going.

Unplug small appliances and electronics before you leave.

Checkbooks

Driver's license

Credit card information

Birth certificates

Social Security cards

Child care, pet care, and other special items

A few months back I posted here about my new soup delivery business I was starting and I met a bunch of amazing people in my neighborhood and got a bunch of interest from people in the surrounding neighborhoods. Since then I have grown the business, moved into a bigger kitchen in Bed-Stuy and am partnering with goodeggs.com to handle online ordering. You can read about the biz and laugh at the comments in the Brooklyn Paper piece [here](http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/14/dtg_soupdelivery_2013_03_29_bk.html)

So now I am looking to expand into more neighborhoods like Bushwick, Greenpoint, Dumbo, Ft. Greene etc. The best suggestion I got was to find pick-up spots in each neighborhood. Businesses that would be cool and let me drop a milk crate of jars once a week there for my customers to pick up during a certain window of time in return for free soup and hopefully making my customers into their customers. 

So what I am looking for help with is names of cool shops, bars, cafes etc that might be cool with this from people on reddit! I don't know the areas so I thought you all could help. 

Thanks guys!

I live near Dean/Franklin or C train Frankin Metro stop. I have Costco Card. It would be nice to split some of the big quantities. You can get a CASE of tomato paste for $8, box of pasta, 6 large boxes for $7. Olive oil, Big bottle, $8, twice as big as the trader joes bottle. Just an idea. Basically, the small corner stores buy there, then raise the price, so it would be a good way to save money, and maybe an adventure. I have a rolling suitcase I could use for the metro, if someone has a car, even better. I just moved here from Oregon, and am trying to save money. Prices are estimates from what I remember from my last trip.
tl;dl : Share a trip to Costco, split huge quantities, I have card. 

EDIT1: Awesome to hear from you all! I suggest after work, like 6pm on a weeknight, or on the weekend. hours:
Costco - Brooklyn, NY | 718-965-7603 | Su 10AM-6PM; Mo-Fr 10AM-8:30PM; Sa 9:30AM-6PM.

If someone has a car, I suggest they propose a time, because that would be easier, then we can meet at a metro stop, drive there, drive back and have less train changes. I have a bias to the Franklin Stop on the C Train, but don't really care :)

Then we can bring some extra jars to split up some items into? Make a shopping list and see what you want and who wants to split the huge quantity. A lot of things, like pasta and sauce are come in packs of 6 boxes pasta, and 18 cans sauce, respectively, so that is easier to split. Meat - comes in packs of steaks for $35, so that is good to split, bring some containers? Salmon is $6 per lb at Costco, $10-12 per pound at Trader Joes, so I do think it is worth the trouble. 

If we learn to do this, it will be easier on consecutive trips. :)

Each of these platforms weigh almost 300lbs each and are not easily transported. We got them from a theater ""yard sale"" and needed a huge trailer to get them to the house.

We are a small up and coming theater company, and were thrilled to get these stage platforms, but now we are up a veritable creek since our new show opens in a month, and have no stage.

If anyone has ANY information or see some used black stage platforms pop up on craigslist (we are checking it vigorously as well) or what have you, please let me know.

First I lived off the Knickerbocker M stop for 2 years, now I'm living off the Morgan L stop. I figured I was moving further West and into a better section but for the first time since moving here, and for the first time ever in my life as a New York City native(grew up in Queens), I was mugged on my way home from work one night. I had a gun pulled on me and my phone was taken from me. I will say I think I got off pretty lucky considering I wasn't harmed and only my phone was taken as opposed to money/wallet/keys/etc. This happened walking home from the J stop at Myrtle/Broadway. Now I take the L to Morgan to avoid going down the same path.

Unfortunately ever since it happened I've felt super cautious walking around to the point of even looking over my shoulder sometimes and I hate that feeling. I'm not even a small guy or anything and to be quite honest I feel there are a lot of other mug-worthy people walking around the streets with their phones out and headphones on, oblivious to everything. Now I don't walk around with headphones on and I'm hesitant to check my phone while walking around. I also work out at Richie's gym which I haven't been to since it happened since it's in the same direction as where I got mugged.

I'm sure my change in behavior is just natural after experiencing something like I did and it'll pass with time, but I was wondering if anyone else in the area could tell me about how they've never had a problem and I should just stop being such a pussy?"	t5_2qme3	True

So yeah, tonight my MKIV GTI was broken into while my wife and I were parked at House of Vans in beautiful Brooklyn, NY. The person or people took two guitars and an MXR 10 band EQ foot pedal that I stupidly left in there. 

If you happen to see any of this equipment at used instrument places, at pawn shops, on craigslist, or on eBay, please let me know. Although my renter's policy should cover my losses (minus the $250 deductible), the total value of the stolen items means a felony was committed and any info, however unlikely, could help the police find the person or persons responsible for said felony.

One guitar is a Fender Telecaster ""Jim Root"" signature model. It's white with black pick guard, black EMGs, locking tuners, and only one volume knob.

The other guitar is a Gibson Les Paul Studio, faded/worn brown finish (not glossy at all. More like furniture in appearance), chrome hardware, and chrome EMGs. This guitar has four dials and all four are exposed posts with no knobs."	t5_2qme3	True

I will be coming down from Montreal on the Columbus day weekend (our Thanksgiving) for the Animal Collective show (Oct. 5) in Williamsburg Park.

I was considering staying in Brooklyn for the whole weekend seeing as how you seem to have lots to do in your neighborhood. Is this a good idea? I'm interested in visiting New York in a more local fashion, as I would suggest to a person visiting my city.

I'm not too sure if I want to couchsurf, or stay in a hostel yet. It's not a question of budget really, just curious to know if there are good hostels in Brooklyn. Most seem to be in Manhattan if I'm not mistaken. Also, if any redditor is interested in hosting me (on a couch), that would be ok too! I'd definitely be willing to pay you some beer, or pizza, etc. I'm a 21 year-old dude. Reddit stalk me if you must.

Do you guys have any microbreweries? Or bars with good beer at the very least?

Feel free to suggest anything cool to do as well.

Thank you!"	t5_2qme3	True

There's a bar at 4th Ave and St. Mark's called Pacific Standard (this is their website: [Pacific Standard](http://pacificstandardbrooklyn.com/)). It's a pretty awesome bar.  It is easy walking distance from Atlantic/Pacific, so the location should be good for a maximum amount of people (as we all know, nowhere in Brooklyn will be good for everyone.)


They have a Pub Quiz that starts at 8pm, and the last round is always a beer tasting round! I'd recommend getting there way earlier than then to get tables and meet each other before we form teams. 

Would anybody be up for this?

TL;DR: Pacific Standard - 82 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn. Sunday, March 27th at 6:30pm.  Who's in?

Edit for Additional Info:

* Here is the Meetup event: http://meetu.ps/MXx6
* I called the bar and their official answer was ""We do not card at the door, but we ask that you please don't bring anyone under 21."" So...make of that what you will. 
* Also, if people are coming, then I'll show up at 6:30 with a REDDIT sign. (Look for a girl.)"	t5_2qme3	True

Not too much -- don't get me wrong, I don't want to be trapped in a blizzard either -- but just a little bit is nice. I like the way it makes the dead trees look.

I also understand that I am fortunate to not own a car. I sympathize with those who have to dig their cars out from snow, scrape the windshield, and all that. For me, not needing to own a car is one of the major benefits of living in Brooklyn and New York City in general.

And I also don't envy those who have to shovel their walkway (since I live in an apartment, that's taken care of). So, I hope I don't come off as insensitive -- I realize snow is pretty inconvenient to a lot of people. That's why I just want only a little! I'll be fine if this was the last of it.

Maybe it's also because I'm a California native, only moved to New York in 2008. Maybe the snow is still novel to me. But it is pretty (before it becomes gray sludge on the street)."	t5_2qme3	True

BreakfastWStrangers	25	10	3	"My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We should be in Brooklyn during the second week of October. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

Edit: The dog's owner came through in Greenpoint. We took the dog back to him. He said she had been playing in the snow and got out of the gate. We are working with him to get her spayed and tagged. Thanks for your help. "	t5_2qme3	True

Trying to help out some Reddit college kids/recent grads.	psdogwalker	19	7	11	"I'm a recent Pratt graduate who started her own dog boarding business. The business has taken off and I've now started doing dog walking too. However, its getting so busy that I need to hire someone new! 

I'm looking for someone preferably 18-25 years old who lives in/by the area (Park Slope).The work is primarily in Park Slope but a little bit in Cobble Hill, Windsor Terrace, and Gowanus. All I need is for you to love dogs, be responsible and trustworthy. All payment is off the books. We pay $8/walk. Also if you liked we could set you up with dog boarding jobs too. You could make $30/night just for hanging out with, feeding, loving and playing with a dog. Its really one of the greatest jobs in the world.

As my business is just expanding into dog walking this wouldn't be a job where you would have work right away after being hired. It might take a couple weeks to build up the clientele for you to have a few dogs to walk. As time went on you could get more and more work. This isn't for anyone looking for a full-time job right away but good for someone who has some extra time after school, in the afternoons, in between classes, etc. Having a bike is a plus!

TL;DR Need a off-the-books dog walker in Park Slope area.

I want to bring back some normalcy to the city/community, I want to start cleaning up the beach.

Good For You! Comedy Show. My friends and I are huge comedy nerds who were looking for a project. We knew enough professional comedians in New York to start our own comedy show. We figured if we could get people who were really excited about comedy, and keep the show free, we could build one of the better rooms in NY. An underground spot for savvy comedy fans, and a place for comedians to feel safe. We've done this, and because we're attracting an excited, welcoming crowd comedians have started talking. After only a few shows we're attracting comedians who prefer to come to our show to try out their Letterman/Conan/Comedy Central sets. This is a passion project (that's why it's free) and we're pretty proud of how it's evolving. Next show is this Saturday June 15th, at 9pm at the Cantina Royal restaurant on north 3rd in Brooklyn. If you live in the area, and are looking to see stand up headliners 100% FREE (the drinks cost money obviously, but there is no minimum) check us out.

Brooklyn's legendary Rubulad art party can only return with your help!!!
 
The Rubulad party, often called ""the best party in Brooklyn"", has 
fallen on hard times, due mostly to the intolerance of the religious 
conservative neighborhood nearby its location. For over 15 years, 
Rubulad has been a seedbed of creativity, bringing together a huge 
community of artists, musicians, and performers of all kinds to 
produce their massive monthly multi-floor extravaganza which has been 
recognized internationally as a party no one should die without 
experiencing.
 
A family of creatives spend an entire week brainstorming, building, 
and decorating before each party. Hundreds of people line up to 
attend the eye popping finale that lasts far beyond sunrise, ending 
with streams of astonished attendees, homeward bound, waiting to tell 
their friends what they saw and did that night.
 
Thousands of photos of Rubulad are online, one more outrageous than 
the next, each photographer trying to capture a piece as a momento 
and proof that ""they were there"".
 
Now is not the time for this gem to disappear. Rubulad has supported 
artists the best way possible, by hiring them, paying them well, and 
showing them love.  Many artists have been put on the map because of 
Rubulad. Rubulad isn't just fun, it's a vital piece of culture!
 
Shall we let intolerance kill the creative hubs in our community? I 
say NO! But what can we do about it???....Rubulad has a Kickstarter 
campaign to raise money to move to a new location. We desperately 
need the money for expenses, build-out, and astronomical real estate 
fees and deposits. The money we make at the parties isn't nearly 
enough, especially since many of the recent parties have been shut 
down before they broke even. We've spent our reserves struggling to 
survive as long as we have, now WE NEED YOUR HELP!
 
Please donate what you can in ANY amount to our Kickstarter!
Forward the link to your friends, family, chat groups, blogs, forums, 
everywhere!
Their are great rewards for donating, and best of all, this vital 
part of Brooklyn will GO ON!

I'm moving to NYC in the fall and I've been looking at various neighborhoods, mostly in Queens but Brooklyn as well. I visited Bay Ridge and it seems like it's a quiet, peaceful neighborhood and it's not super expensive like other places.

Is it always like that or was I just lucky that day? I also want to know about the commute since it seems like I'll be sitting on the R everyday for a good while. How long does it take to get to midtown? Any other info about this area? 

Thanks!

It's in Park Slope/South Slope the first and third Thursdays of each month. Here's the [facebook link](https://www.facebook.com/events/451148078232657/)

While it's a free show, I feel as though you pay with your time. That's why I pledge to bring the absolute best talent to the stage that is available to me. Friends don't get on stage because they're friends. Only the best get on my stage. It's that dedication to quality that I hope brings you out and keeps you coming back.

I am also EXTREMELY sorry for your loss and if there is anything I can do please let me know.

The roommate is gone most of the time, since he's got a lady. I'm moving home due to an illness in the family, and my room (and all of the apartment except roomie's bedroom) is up for grabs. 

It's in flatbush, a rapidly-gentrifying neighborhood that I've loved since I moved at the start of November (when the lease is up). I'm across the street from the library, have great B/Q train service, and run in the park most days. 

I'm happy to discuss anything and all, just let me know. 

Roomie and I would meet/interview you, but only because we know you can take it. 

To actually estimate the square footage, well, the living room is 15x25, the kitchen 10/15, the hallway space an additional 12x15. Counting the bathroom, that's 840 square feet. The room is 10x10, so it's tight with a queen bed but the rest of the apartment makes up for it. We haven't come close to using all the space, and it'll be almost completely empty when I move out (most everything is mine).

Basically they were looking for the best way to promote sustainability, community entrepreneurship, through an innovative design that is self contained in a standard shipping container. Here are the exact details for the competition, http://dekalbmarket.com/2011/01/19/not-a-container-design-contest/ . They have narrowed it down to five finalist, you can either like the designs here, http://issuu.com/dekalbmarket , or like them through facebook here, http://www.facebook.com/DekalbMarket. My friend was a member of the design team for the finalist called ""Craig Shilitto"", and although I am biased, I think that entry really does the best job at meeting the criteria for the competition.

Tommy from Cushing asks:

“What is the difference between isolated storms and scattered storms?”

Isolated and scattered both refer to areal coverage.  Isolated refers to hit and miss.  We don’t expect that many storms.  That might equate to a 20-30% chance for rain at any one location.

Scattered would indicate a better chance for storms.  Rain chances would be between 40-60%. 

The other category would be numerous.  When we forecast numerous thunderstorms, the radar should be pretty full.

You really shouldn’t say “there’s a 20% chance for isolated thunderstorms.”  It’s redundant.  You should either say “there’s a 20% chance for thunderstorms,” or “there are isolated thunderstorms in the forecast.”"	t5_2qme3	True

I've been in Brooklyn for 5+ years and have consistently found it extremely difficult to make real friends.  I'm willing to admit that part of that is me, but part of it is NYC in general.  I try to go to events that interest me (when I have the money), great events like Secret Science Club or Star Talk Live, but these are things people go to with groups of friends they already have and with no chance of interaction. Comedy shows, live music, bars are mostly the same.  I'm not dorky enough for the Way Station crowd, but way too dorky for the Woods, Union Pool, Levee crowd.  What I mean by this is that I don't really fit into a niche that gives me a ""go to"" place.  I guess I'm just trying to find out how people have made friends (outside of work) in such a situation. Advice/friends/meetups are all welcome.  Thanks in advance for reading and any info/suggestions are much appreciated.

Edit: I want to make clear that I'm not in any way trying to disparage the Way Station crowd or the Wburg ""hipster"" bar crowd (both contain a lot of really good folks).  I only meant to use these as examples of different ends of a spectrum of places where I don't really feel like I fit in.

I subscribed to receive the Nonsense NYC emails, so I have a slight idea of some cool stuff going on, but I need your help! New York is effin huge, with tons of stuff going on all the time. We'll be in Manhattan mostly but I want to spend a day/evening in Brooklyn. Not too interested in the regular tourist shit. Here are my questions:

1. Best coffee in Brooklyn? We're from Seattle, so I wondering where I can get an amazing latte or some good drip. 

2. Any good shows next week (Monday - Thursday)? We like all types of music from Dubstep (not Brostep) to Mastodon to The Mountain Goats. Down for something interesting, an up and coming band local band perhaps? 

3. Local clothing store? Or some local shop that I should hit up?

4. Best bar? I'd like to hit a more locals bar and maybe somewhere with higher end cocktails. I have read that Dram is good, is that true? 

5. Any thing that I should NOT miss? We don't have tons of time, but trying to get an idea of stuff to do. 

Any help or advice is seriously appreciated. This trip was planned sort of last minute, so we're pretty much open for anything. Cheers. "	t5_2qme3	True

1295931511.0	f8jhn	Need an apartment in Brooklyn		9	0	8	"Hi, Reddit. I've casually browsed this site for many years and decided to finally cave in and make an account here, seeing as how this site has brought much joy to many people. Yes, I'm new, and yes, I'm here to call in a favor.

My friend is a humble, 24 year old girl that works with educating troubled city youth. To make ends meet, she also works part time in the food service industry. With both jobs combined, she never actually has a day off for another two months. Both of us are paying off school loans, so we've been sort of lacking in funds for a bit, but still able to pay for a $600/month room + utilities and all things necessary for living in this great city.

Recently, my friend has been in a series of sublets: One, at an apartment for a member of a local music group, but was abruptly forced out after a tour was abruptly ended. Recently, she found a nice place by the Brooklyn Museum stop on the 2/3, but her roommate decided to also abruptly end the sublet to allow her good friend to move in, thus forcing my friend out. She looked around on CraigsList, but you know that whole random roommate situation works out on there.

So I ask you this, Reddit. Do you know of a place for a polite 24 year old girl to rent a room for $600/month + utilities or less? She doesn't smoke, she's quite responsible (fiscally and in any other sense), incredibly friendly, respectful and quiet. She's also hugely into music, and an incredibly compassionate person (did I mention that she helps educate troubled inner city youth?). She's currently staying with my roommates and I until she finds a place to call her own and doesn't have to keep moving from place to place. Knowing her, she'd like to find something in the Prospect Heights/Crown Heights/South Slope area, where you can get to Harlem within an hour or less by train and it's not a pain/a scare to come back home. That's all I ask.

TL;DR: Anyone have a place for $600/month in Brooklyn?"	t5_2qme3	True

[repost from /r/nyc]	FaustTheBird	13	6	13	"Hello from across the East River! Earlier this year I began working for WiFi-NY, a community network and alternative last-mile Internet provider in NYC that you can get in your home and around the neighborhood. It's an incredible project building a wireless network infrastructure separate from the incumbent carrier loops, and I'm quitting my day job to focus all of my efforts on it. We're making a push to get a bunch of new members before the end of the year, and I'm coming to you to raise awareness about what we do. Here's a short list of some of things I think are awesome about us:

    * Always-on access for only $25/month with no taxes or fees
    * Use the same account for home access and roaming access
    * Pay as you go connectivity: only pay for what you need and save money
    * No contracts, cancellation fees, or hidden anythings
    * A commitment to network neutrality, ethical computing, fair access, and localizing traffic, infrastructure ownership, and media.

We're buying a bigger connection to the Net to increase our speeds by more than 10x, and the more the network spreads, the more wireless coverage there is. If any of you or your friends/family are in the LES (10009, 10003, 10002) or West Brooklyn (Williamsburg, Greenpoint), get in touch with me and let's talk about getting hooked up.

We survey your building for a few minutes to determine if installation is feasible, and if so, it only takes about 2 hours to setup. You can also just scan for our wireless network beacon ""wifiNY.net"", connect, and signup on your own without needing to do anything else.

Check us out at http://wifiny.net/. (Click to accept the self-signed certificate; we didn't pay for a signed certificate, we just used our own.) I'd love to have more Redditors on our network! Also, AMA, and thanks for reading!"	t5_2qme3	True

We've had quite a bit of water leaking into our bedroom over the past 2 days, we of course tried contacting the management company to no avail.  Left messages, emails, we obtained cell phone #'s of the main manager, left messages there, no dice.  The leaks continued after the rain last night ended, so we're thinking its either a burst pipe or a neighbor's air conditioner improperly installed.  We tried to get a hold of said neighbors and they seem to be home but they wouldn't answer the door when we tried knocking several times. I'm supposed to leave on a 5 day camping trip tomorrow night but I'm afraid of what might happen to the room/wall if I leave it like this.  If this doesn't get resolved by tomorrow what are my options? Preferably something that will get results QUICKLY, I'm afraid of having mildew in the walls of my room for the rest of the time I'm living here (which I was planning on doing for a while, I really liked it here until this). Oh yeah, and we just got notified that the management company hasn't been paying the power bill for the hallway lights, outdoor lights, etc. It just feels like they either they just vanished into thin air. So that's great too.

[edit]
Finally got some results from both the landlord and the person upstairs.. there was an AC leaking into the wall, i let him know and it seems to have stopped for now.  It still seemed like a ton of water for an AC leak, so I assume it was building up in the wall over time until it finally bust out.  The landlord claims the office phones have been down all week, I was able to get the maintenance worker's cell # from my neighbor and he said he would be here around 11-11:30, so that makes him almost late...will update.

PangeaDestructor	10	1	5	"Hey /r/Brooklyn, I live in Carroll Gardens and last week I noticed that on Monday morning a number of garbage bags had been torn open, and the waste had been dumped out all over the sidewalk in a few different spots (a few on 1st between Henry and Clinton, an A LOT up around 1st at Court). The garbage smell was bad, but I'm more concerned about an increase in the local rat and cockroach population. Plus, it's just a dick move.

Last night, I took my dog out and noticed people collecting recyclables. I didn't think anything of it, but this morning the trash bags along 1st had been ripped open and dumped all over the sidewalk again. 

Just a heads up to any neighbors on Reddit, as I think the same people will keep doing this each week on Sunday night after dark until they are given a reason to stop. "	t5_2qme3	True

1374113566.0	1ij4j4	Need legal advice for most likely illegally getting pulled over in bed stuy	Bridgetthemidget	7	0	7	"Driving home from rockaway beach around 8pm on Ralph Ave and Decateur St. lights began flashing behind our car.  We were stopped at a red light and as traffic began to move we slowly inched up the block to pull over for whatever official car was behind us.  As we tried to pull over three under cover cops approached the windows which were rolled down and said ""Do you understand what those lights mean?"" Without announcing they were undercovers, we, being in a not so nice neighborhood thought we may be getting mugged and the driver lurched forward trying to pull over more, to get out of the moving traffic.  They proceeded to reach their hands in the windows and grab the driver by the shirt and arms, as well as reaching in the passenger window, pushing the passenger back into the seat and turned the car off.  Yelling, they told the driver to get out of the car.  After a few minutes passed they told all the passengers to get out as well. They immediately put the driver (Black man) in cuffs.  Two of the passengers asked three to five times why we were being pulled over and taken out of the car and they responded ""You want me to count the ways?""  After much prodding to get them to explain to us why we were being pulled over, they explained that one person had their foot out the window and one person threw a cigarette butt out the window.  Also, when they were pulling us over, one man thought he was going to be run over while we were trying to pull over.  

After more threatening of the driver (black man in cuffs) asking if there was anything illegal in his car to which he replied no, and if he would have an issue if they looked through the car to which he replied yes, they claimed to have smelled marijuana (which no one in the car was smoking at ANY point) and proceeded to search the car five to six times to no avail.  While they were searching the car, one passenger began taking down officers names and badge numbers.  One undercover started yelling at her, telling her to stop and that if ""that's how we want to do it, we'll do it the hard way.  We're all going down to the precinct."" Finally, looking in the trunk of the jeep cherokee (attached trunk) they found an almost empty bottle of Rum which was in a brown paper bag inside a black deli bag inside a tote bag.  They asked the four passengers whose bottle it was.  One person owned up to it.  they never asked the driver about it.

One bystander announced she worked at the city council office.  At this point they finally uncuffed the driver and allowed us to reenter the car and finally pull over to the side of the road.  After more time, they finally issued one passenger a ticket for littering and the driver a ticket for failing to pull over and a ticket for an open container.  

What are our rights?  I know we got away lucky but we still feel that at least the drivers tickets can be contested and that we have the right to file a complaint.  We are not totally legally literate, but we really feel our rights were violated.  What should we do?"	t5_2qme3	True

My friends and I are huge comedy nerds who were looking for a project. We knew enough professional comedians in New York to start our own comedy show. We figured if we could get people who were really excited about comedy, keep the show free, we could build one of the better rooms in NY. An underground spot for savvy comedy fans, and a place for comedians to feel safe. We've done this, and because we're attracting an excited, welcoming crowd comedians have started talking. After only a few shows we're attracting comedians who prefer to come to our show to try out their Letterman/Conan/Comedy Central sets. This is a passion project (that's why it's free) and we're pretty proud of how it's evolving. 

Next show is May 25th, 9pm at the Cantina Royal restaurant on north 3rd. If you live in the area, and are looking to see stand up headliners 100% FREE (the drinks cost money obviously, but there is no minimum) check us out.

 [I've had a lot of luck with NYC redditors coming out in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/n0d6m/hey_rnyc_looking_for_folks_to_volunteer_some_time/), so I thought I'd give it a shot again this year.

We're looking for people from 10am-1pm and 2pm-5pm (with an hour break for lunch and hanging out) on Saturday (12/8), Sunday (12/9), Monday (12/10) and Tuesday (12/11). If you can come for a whole day, great! Half a day? That's good too! All four days? What are you, some kind of saint?

No matter how long you come to volunteer, you'll get a sweet gift bag including an assortment of comics, featuring the CBLDF Liberty Annual 2012 limited edition variant cover by Gabriel Ba or Terry Dodson (only available through the CBLDF), and a CBLDF branded water bottle. You'll also get the satisfaction that comes with protecting the First Amendment and the freedom to read, write, draw, publish, and sell comics.

These things are really fun. The CBLDF is a great way for anyone interested in working in the comics industry to make some contacts and meet other like-minded folks. 

If you're wondering about exactly what our organization does, check out our FAQ [here](http://cbldf.org/f-a-q/). Please shoot me a PM if you're interested.

I'm in a bit of a pickle and not sure what to do so I made an account to ask you guys. 

I moved to Bay Ridge from Manhattan about 9 months ago with my boyfriend. In Manhattan, gas and electric are billed together from Con Ed so when I switched addresses I didn't know I needed to register my gas with National Grid and nobody told me otherwise. My Con Ed bill has been coming and I've been paying it and both the gas and electric have been working fine up until 3 weeks ago.

My gas mysteriously shut off. So I called Con Ed and asked them why my gas shut off and they told me I need to call National Grid. I called National Grid and they asked me for a copy of my lease in order to open an account with them. My question for you is, am I going to be billed all at once for all the gas I've used since the start of my lease? Am I going to have to pay it all before they turn my gas back on? 
How much is a typical gas bill for a 1 bedroom apt so I can gauge whether or not I can pay it? 

Thanks guys!!!! 

TLDR; moved into apartment thinking i was paying the gas bill but it was on by mistake as i dont actually have an account with the gas company - if i open an account will i be billed for use from the start of my lease (which they are asking for as ID)"	t5_2qme3	True

Our thought, then, is to introduce the cat to a dog and see how he reacts. Often, the cat will sit at the window, watching dogs walk by five feet away without freaking out, so he might be cool with it. But, we sadly don't have any friends with dogs. 

If you do have a dog, and you think that maybe you'd like to introduce him to our cat, PM me. Maybe your SO and you could bring him by and we could cook you dinner in exchange for bringing your dog over. Bonus points if you have a shiba inu or an Alaskan klee kai.

My two roommates and I have a beautiful apartment that we love. It came with all new appliances, including a gigantic fridge.

In January, our fridge broke. We lost all of the food in it (roughly $100 worth of food per person). Our building manager (not our landlord, who we do not interact with) did not replace the fridge for two weeks. We asked to have the cost of the food we lost deducted from our rent, and he refused. 

After two weeks, he gave us a temporary unit, which is too small for all three of us. He told us he would get us a new one soon, saying that the company wants $500 from him to replace it.

It has been a month and a half since he gave us the temp fridge and no progress seems to be made. At the beginning of the month, my roommate's father, who is the guarantor on the lease, told our building manager that we didn't want to pay our rent until we got a new fridge and his response was, ""Then you will be hearing from our lawyer.""

We paid the rent, not wanting any trouble - we love our place, and want to renew the lease (I am not currently on the lease). However, this is just getting annoying. 

Reddit, does anyone have any advice about what to do in this situation? We need our fridge back!

UPDATE: Well, magically, it looks like we will be getting a new fridge on Friday :)
Thank you all for the advice! It means a lot that you guys even tried to offer what you knew."	t5_2qme3	True
