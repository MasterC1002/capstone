Jason Richardson's 3-ball has a beautiful arc, the game does it justice i think. 
Most of all i love the commentary, my fav of any sports game, i love the short stories and the anecdotes about different teams and specific players, lil bit of background on them makes me appreciate them even more.

I'm Max Zagorac(fake name), a 6'0"" PG from UCLA and was drafted by the Golden State Warriors in the 2011 NBA Draft. At first, I was highly disappointed at being chosen by a team that already had a great point guard in Stephen Curry, but I got over that quick after taking over the starting point guard position. I quickly became one of the best passers in the game, finding Monta Ellis, David Lee, and Ekepe Udoh under the basket for quick plays. Curry obviously wasn't too happy about coming off the bench, but he was a valuable contributor to the team and won 6th Man of the Year. I won rookie of the year and we made the 4th seed, losing to the Clippers in a heartbreaking 7 games of the first round. They went on to win the conference, but lose to ""The Big Three"" and the Heat in 6 games. This was a sign of things to come.

Now in my second year, the Warriors made no offseason changes. In fact, they got rid of many valuable contributors and kept recent draft picks. I'm not sure what it is with MyCareer and drafting, but because of the Warriors' alphabetical order, we choose near the end. This happens every year, with the 76ers getting first pick every year, followed by Bobcats, Bucks, Bulls, etc. It is very annoying. I managed to win most improved and we won best record in the conference, only to lose in seven games/second round to OKC. All year long, we tore teams apart with our P&amp;R, but they were always the team giving us issues. Durant/Westbrook/Harden/Ibaka/Perkins just seemed to be unbeatable. That game seven certainly was a nail-biter. They ended up winning the title, defeating the Celtics in 6 games. I was starting to get frustrated.

Now in my 3rd season, I had something to prove. Once again, we made no offseason acquisitions. Instead we dropped players and kept our lousy draft pics. We still managed to win best record in the league. I won my first MVP award and Curry again won 6th Man. We cruised through the playoffs until once again we met our nemesis, OKC, in the Western Conference Finals. After another heated battle between our top two teams, OKC came out on top once again, besting us in 7 games. It was always 7 games. They went on to defeat the Indiana Pacers 4-1 and win once again. Obviously, my frustration with the team was at a boiling point.

Now in my 4th year, I had some decisions to make. My rookie contract was up and I was now a free agent. The Warriors made a lame offer to me, but with my ability and quest to finally win a championship, I declined and sought refuge in the market. I felt a sense of loyalty towards the team that drafted me and gave me a chance, but I wanted something new. I felt even worse after I found out Steph Curry left via free agency to the Detroit Pistons, leaving the Warriors a shell of themselves. Being from Los Angeles, UCLA graduate, and life-long Lakers fan, I naturally gravitated towards the listless Lakers. Despite having the likes of Baron Davis, Kobe Bryant, Metta World Peace, Pau Gasol, and Andrew Bynum, the Lakers barely made the playoffs the past two years. I signed a five year contract and became their starting point guard. They also signed Ty Lawson and made him our new small forward, making it a Zagorac/Bryant/Lawson/Gasol/Bynum lineup. Gasol was still recovering from a torn ACL a season ago, leaving him out for the first two months and Bynum was on and off with his knee injuries. We had no big names on the bench, just undersized rookies. I even twisted my ankle and ended up playing only half the season. Despite all the injuries, we still managed to get the 3rd seed in the West. We made it to the Western Conference finals again, meeting a familiar foe. By this time, OKC has lost James Harden to free agency. Rather then go for a three-peat the man went for more money and joined the Boston Celtics, who were now sans-Garnett, Allen, and a weakened Paul Pierce. OKC proved again to be a formidable opponent, but this time, we got the better of them in six games. However, in the 6th game, we lost Kobe Bryant to injury and he would miss the NBA Finals. This was my team now. We would meet the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by Kyrie Irving and Tyreke Evans. Because of their penchant to receive the #5 pick in every draft, the Cavs were loaded with young talent. They resigned Irving to the end of the decade and signed free agents Evans and Paul Millsap. They had all around talent and surely played like it. Once again, we made it to game 7 of the NBA finals and barely beat out the Cavs in the closing minutes. My player was overjoyed at the fact that he finally won an NBA title. I was given the finals MVP and probably a seal of approval by Kobe Bryant, who sat on the bench the entire series. The torch had been passed.

My 5th year in the NBA was to be one of records. Record breaking that is. I set the record for steals, assists, minutes, and nearly points. I scored 80 points to almost beat Kobe's record but unfortunately, our coach (Patrick Ewing) took me out before I could make that last basket. We kept the team we had from last year and dealt with a few minor injuries. Other than our two big men, we had nobody bigger than 6'7"" which was a constant problem in the post. However, we still went on to have the best record in the conference. I won my second MVP award and again made it to the NBA Finals against Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah and the young Chicago Bulls. Having the 1st round, #4 draft pick every year, they were eventually going to put up a competitive team. However, after winning the first game of the series, they lost Noah to an ankle injury and we just steamrolled them after that. We defeated the Chicago Bulls and won our 2nd championship in a row, Kobe Bryant's 7th.

Now in my 6th year, my player has accomplished 14 out of the 10 requirements to get into the hall of fame. Although I was having fun in Los Angeles, I was getting a bit bored of destroying every team that matched up against us. I requested a trade, knowing the Lakers would be taken care of because I was the best player in the league at that point. To my surprise, I was traded to the Denver Nuggets for Danilo Gallinari and a young C named Andre Semenko (72 Overall). I came to a Denver Nuggets team that seemed to be in rebuilding mode. They had just signed Marshon Brooks off free agency, had a 28 year old rookie named Justin Harper as their PF, Andre Blatche as their C, and Jordan Hamilton as their SF. They lost Lawson to free agency and traded away most of their assets, including Kenneth Faried. This was going to be a challenge. We went on to have a 14 game winning streak that took us to the top of the conference and before you know it, the damn Nuggets trade me again. Seems like I was heading back to Los Angeles, except this time, I was going to be a Clipper. I was traded for Blake Griffin and a young PF named Ted Ryan (83 Overall). The Clippers were a shell of the team that had won the Western Conference in my first year in the league. The only players they had left from that Championship run were Eric Bledsoe and Mo Williams. Williams looked like a haggard old man, while Bledsoe had grown into the starting point guard. I took of the PG position, moving him up to SG, while a newly signed Landry Fields went to SF, Iilyasova at PF, and journeyman Hassan Whiteside at C. It took a while to get our footing together, but we got to it eventually. The Clippers are blessed with the #7 pick in all drafts, so we have some young talent, but again, no BIG men. Whiteside can barely finish under the rim while Iilyasova can hit the outside jumper occasionally. We're at the All-Star break and ranked second, just under the ever-improving Denver Nuggets. They lost Ryan for the season, but it looks like they're flourishing under Griffin. Unfortunately for the Lakers, it seems like their stacked lineup isn't helping much. They're currently in the 8th seed and hobbling long with injuries. The Lawson/Bryant/Gallinari/Gasol/Bynum lineup certainly is impressive and both teams benefitted from trading me. However, I am the difference maker and can change any team I'm on. I find myself being the number 1 scoring option on the team and the league. Even though my rebound and assists are down, I'm still making a huge contribution to the team. I will update more if you wish to see more.

Bench Warmer: 64

Role Player: 72

Sixth Man: 78

Starter/Star: Doesn't matter.

The exception is the Prospect role, and players on rookie contracts will usually be happy with this role, even if they are not happy with Role Player and Sixth Man.

My suggestion is that age and your team record last year should also impact their decision. A 35 year old player that could be a starter should be OK with being a role player on a championship team.

Also, later in Association a lot of mediocre players will fill up the free agents list. And almost none of them will accept a bench warmer role since most of them have around 65-68 overall rating.

This usually means that my friends and I toggle off player roles. But I don't like that since I feel you shouldn't be able to fill your team with stars.

What do you think?

EDIT: It has been mentioned that some have had better players with the Sixth man role. At least I witnessed an 80 rating Danny Granger who wanted an upgraded role."	t5_2s84e	True

For the teams that have a sort of ""big 3"" or whatever, I will make that team's cover have those 3 players (Heat, Spurs, Rockets, OKC with the big 2) I will make an album with all of the covers sometime soon.  

Now it may take a little bit because that IS 30 covers...Oh, another thing.  I have tested out the sizing of these covers on my Xbox cases, and they fit.  I CAN'T do that for PS3, because I don't have PS3 games, soooo for now I will be doing Xbox covers, and maybe I can do PS3 covers later on.  As long as this all gets done by October 1st, we'll be good, so we've got time.  

**Please upvote this so everyone can see and comment with their team's player.**  It's a text post, so no karma obviously.  THANK YOU!

**EDIT:**  Also if you can find a GOOD picture of your player (High Res, easy to cut them out) and you posted it, you would make this process go A LOT quicker!  Thanks"	t5_2s84e	True

My first gold player, among my all bronze team. My starting line up was Patty Mills, Jodie Meeks, Lebron James, Scott Hastings, and Petro. I was feeling pretty great, and I wanted to roll through seventh seed...
Until I joined a game with someone who had Patrick Ewing, Aldridge, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Westbrook as starters and a full silver bench with 3 gold players in it. But I wasn't going to quit. Might as well take a stab at it.
First quarter over, down by 5 at the end of it, 19-14. I knew the guy was trash and the only thing that made him get shots in was the players. He always mashed X to steal, and always waited until 5 seconds until he threw up a terrible shot that always went in. At halftime, I was down by 5 still. He was just abusing Lebron and Westbrook. He kept going into replay mode to show his 'Amazing dunk' on one of my bronze players. I was getting a little fed up because he was outscoring me without any actual ability to play the game...
Last Quarter, down by 1. I want to beat this guy so, oh so bad. Quarter goes on, last minute, down by 4! My possession, and I throw it into the paint with Petro standing right there, and he makes it a 2 point game! 31 seconds left as I foul Westbrook on the inbound. He amazingly misses the first. I'm ready to take this game home and tell everyone I just beat a douche with money! AND THEN HE MISSES THE SECOND! All I need is an open shot, any open shot. I call the timeout and we're just about to inbound as...

1361405874.0	18x5a6	I've noticed most people seem to have problems timing certain players' shots correctly (Larry Bird especially), so I'd like to share how to time any shot perfectly.	Mintiendo	50	7	7	"Most people don't notice, but in 2k, they GIVE you an indicator of when you have to time your player's shot. This indicator, which I'll mention below, was in 2k12 as well, but I'm not sure about any earlier games.

Around your controlled player's feet is a circle. When taking a shot, this circle flashes quickly, illuminating for a very short time. If you let go of the shot stick/button right after seeing the flash, the shot will be correctly timed. Be careful though; if you release the stick/button **exactly** as it flashes, the release will be too early. Your reaction time is accounted for with the flash, so you should be letting go *slightly* after.

This video demonstrates a little better than I can put in words (I'm in a rush): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qhkR8Jy00c

I think it would be awesome, if 2k implemented something like ""MyCareer Moments."" Here's an example:

  I can't count how many times the game has asked my player to bring the team within 5 points, or take the lead by the end of the half, etc. And even when you do, all you get is 100 more vc, and thats really it.
  What if it was made into a really cool spectacle. For example, you are rallying back from being down by 15, there is 3 minutes left, and you begin to take a shot from behind the arc that could potentially give you the lead. Right after you release , a camera/graphic sequence occurs. Much like in MLB BIGS when you hit a homerun, it showed 4 different camera angles of your hit and added graphics and sound effects to make it effective. Then, as the balls sinks through the net, the game slows down for a second. It shows the crowd reaction, the players reaction, YOUR player banging his fist against his chest. You did it. WHAT A RALLY!

A variety of these moments would definitely add more to the experience. We are all so attached to our players already, this would make it really special.

This could also be used when you have a REALLY monster dunk. A slow down sequence where everyone is holding their breath. One can dream.

1. Bring back the d-league. The d-league was great for evaluating young players and giving them a place to play while keeping them in your team system. Often I find that I don't have much space for rookies on my team because they have low overalls and I end up with a shortage of young talent.

2. Send players overseas. This could be something like a step above the d-league but a step below the NBA.

3. Summer league. After the draft you could play rookies, d-leaguers, etc. in the summer league to see of they are worth keeping and developing. You could play the summer league or simulate it and view the stats. 

Those are my ideas, feedback is welcome."	t5_2s84e	True

I've been playing 2k11 on 360 since right before 2k12 came out (Didn't bother to get it because I had just got 2k11). 2k11 is my favorite basketball game so far, and I just couldn't get used to 2k12.

My question for those who have already played it: Is it worth the 60 bucks? I'm frugal when it comes to buying video games. Is the ball handling stick/shot stick trigger a fluid as the dev promos described it? Is the Dream Team all that it's hyped to be? What else can you tell me about it that makes it stand out?

I'm trying to figure out if I can get it today, but I want to make sure it's the best investment to make in a video game before I buy it. Like I said. I LOVE what 2k has done with the franchise, and I expect nothing less than great, but I wanted more opinions before buying a rehashed 2k12."	t5_2s84e	True

What about choosing what era to play in? Like, playing in the Jordan era, holy crap right?! Every team has a legend on it, so superteams arent a problem. Just my thoughts.""

One of my ideas was to add other All Star teams from the different years, with their court (e.g. '96 east team vs '13 west allstars)

1363971180.0	1at33n	They need to introduce some human factor in the game: I call it Discipline	i-Mage	40	5	9	"The game still feels too much like a number's game. Put Michael Beasley on your team and he could put up 30-10 every night and become your franchise player, because the game only looks at the numbers, the abilities. Put Brandon Jennings on your team, and he routinely shoots 50% and plays like Derrick Rose II. 

They have got to put in what I would call a **Discipline** factor. A **highly disciplined player tend to play the ball game like a professional** (the only reason people actually pay you to play basketball). They fight the ball game 110%, never put up wild shots, never do silly, unconstructive hero ball, know their spot on the team, play good team defense, be a no-nonsense good professional like a FBI agent (semi-kidding).

Players like **Tim Duncan, Kobe, Shane Battier, KG, Manu Ginobili, Ray Allen, Jarrett Jack, Chauncey Billups** etc., should have a high discipline and they benefit the team performance and chemistry. Teams with mostly disciplined players (San Antonio, OKC, Denver) tend to play better and win more games.

(To put things into perspective, Larry Bird should probably have 99.)

Players like **Javale McGee, Andray Blatche, Michael Beasley, Nate Robinson, Nick Young, Jordan Crawford, Brandon Jennings, and Allen Iversion** (AI diehard fans don't like this already), have low discipline and tend to be chemistry killers, stat sheet fillers, do unconstructive things, spread negative energy around them and bring their teams down. Teams filled with players with low discipline (Washington Wizards before the Great Purge, New York in Stephon Marbury era) tend to underperform despite having considerable amount of talents.

They should include a Discipline factor to go along with other non-ability human factors like consistency and clutch. Without it, the game is a number's game.

EDIT: HOW IT MANIFESTS IN GAME: Individually, players with low discipline is more likely to **shoot wild shots** (eg. 2 steps behind 3pt line with 17 seconds on shot clock), **make bad offensive executions** (eg. go at defense all by themselves and not giving up to open teammates just one pass away), **go for photogenic putback dunks** more than necessary and missing out on transition defense *cough mcgee cough*, **dribble for a fastbreak and make wild pass** without having a good Ball Handle *cough mcgee again cough*. In cutscenes, these players are more likely to show negative body language, spreading negative energy through and through."	t5_2s84e	True

1360659669.0	18db1o	Under the radar NBA 2k13 Players		32	2	46	"I compiled a short list of 10 players that you should get on your team (MyTeam, Association, online association, etc.) based on cost, publicity, potential, and current level of skill. 

**Gerald Wallace, SF, 31 years old, Nets - 6'7""**
He's more well known than some players on this list and is the closest thing to a superstar on this list but he's a good place to start as he has a little bit less publicity following him as opposed to some of the star swingmen in NBA 2k13. To put his effectiveness simply - he can drive like LeBron, he can dunk like Josh Smith, he can rebound better than any SF I've ever played with, he plays defense like a tall Tony Allen, and he has a decent shot, too. 

**Hamed Haddadi, C, 25 years old, Raptors - 7'3""!!!!**
To use the words of Stephen A. Smith - THIS GUY IS A BONAFIDE SCRUB! Why would I put him on this list? He's a 25 year old 7'3"" scrub. That means potential, so this guy is a association must-have. There's a huge lack of star big men. This guy actually has some decent base offensive stats, but his defense needs development. He'll grab rebounds and be able to put it back mostly because of his height, but develop him and you've got yourself an unchained beast on your hands.

**Avery Bradley, PG/SG, 22 years old, Celtics - 6'2""**
This guy might not be as under the radar due to Rondo's injury, but I still think he is overlooked in NBA 2k13. He is a beast at on ball defense, and has a very silky shot that just feels good to use. Not only that, but he's young at only 22 years of age. Develop him offensively and you have a great starter at the combo guard spot. 

**Paul Millsap, PF, 28 years old, Jazz - 6'10""**
He's the second oldest player on this list behind Gerald Wallace at 28 years of age, but trust me, you can build your franchise around this guy. He's a great post scorer, rebounder, ball handler (for a big man) and even a good passer. He could use some work on his defense, but other than that he's one of my favorite PF's to play with.

**Jeremy Evans SF/PF, 25 years old, Jazz, 6'9""**
Athleticism. This guy won the dunk contest a year ago, and he's got athleticism like no other. Despite the fact that he was put in the mainstream because of his dunk contest win his name really has faded away. Put this guy in training camp for ball handling, shooting, passing, whatever. You could literally take this guy and make a Center, Power Forward, Small Forward, or even an Austin Daye-like SG. The possibilities are endless with him at the flex. Not only that, but he's already a great guy to run pick and roll with. For whatever reason this guy loves to cut to the basket and roll hard on the pick and roll. It might be in his player tendencies. You could easily cheese with this guy online already. I scored 20 with him last game in 5 minute quarters. He's that effective. 

**Jose Calderon, PG, 29 years old, Raptors - 6'1""**
He's the best pick and roll PG by a mile to me. His shot form is silky, he's a great ball handler, he's a great passer, and he can finish at the rim. He's the 5th best pure PG in the game in my opinion. Start him or play him at sixth man and you've got a great core PG. 

**Danny Green, SG/SF, 25 years old, Spurs - 6'6""**
Danny Green gets no love. He's a great shooter, and can finish at the rim. He's got good athleticism and is a solid defender on top of that. He's already starter worthy. Not much to say about him other than that. 

**Carl Landry, PF, 29 years old, Warriors - 6'9""**
Now I might be biased here because he's a Purdue Boilermaker, but he is one of the hardest working big men in real life, and it transfers over to this game as well. He has a nose for the ball on the boards, he cuts to the basket well, and can finish shots in traffic. He's also very quick for a PF and can get in passing lanes for steals. At times I've even ran the floor after grabbing a rebound on defense with this guy. He's a great player to have on your team and he's extremely overlooked

**Chandler Parsons, SF, Rockets, 24 years old - 6'9""**
I say SF, but since he's young you can develop him as a flex PF or SG. Silky shot, can finish in traffic, gets putback dunks left and right, plays solid on ball D, is taller than most SGs and even SFs and grabs boards. Anything else you want from a flex player? I know I can't think of anything. Get this guy. 

**Reggie Evans, PF, 31 years old, Nets - 6'9""**
Rebounding and hustle machine. Next. 

**Goran Dragic, PG, 25 years old, Suns**
He can score, pass, and ball handle. He needs a lot of work on defense but that will come with time and training camps. He has a lack of athleticism as well but he can get to the rim. He's a Jose Calderon mold of player and comes at a cheap price. He's a prospect you should have on any Association team.

1372160887.0	1h163l	This game needs some INSTABILITY	i-Mage	35	4	16	"One thing about the game, among others, is that **players careers are way too stable**.

By that I mean they progress, go through a career, and decline when Father Time catches up. There may be injuries, there may be varying degree of potential, and thus ceiling. But it's more or less the same.

The problem this leads to, is that there will be a lot of good players (80+) about 5 years into simulation. The reason why this game is still a poor simulator because they have made players far too consistent. 

There are a lot of things that derail a NBA career, namely **injuries** (Greg Oden, Penny Hardaway), **drugs** (Shawn Kemp), **alcohol** (Derrick Coleman), **attitude problem** (Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury), **crime**, etc.

Let's look at Penny Hardaway, the basketball prodigy, a player who could very well rival Kobe as the best SG of the decade, was derailed by injury. Grant Hill, a player who could very well have a HOF career, was derailed by injury. Marbury, whose attitude had killed team chemistry wherever he went, was shunned by the NBA before he even reached a retirement age. Darius Miles, Larry Hughes, DaJuan Wagner, Tim Thomas, etc. etc.

Talent and potential are not the only things that keep players in the NBA, but the game is only taking those two into account.

**TLDR: Would love to see players getting derailed by all sorts of things (e.g. a random permanent drop in Rtg and potential after, say, a torn ACL or something). For realism.**"	t5_2s84e	True

1330555787.0	qc00y	Guide to MyPlayer mode [PG]		37	7	19	"What's good, r/NBA2k? I've been playing a good amount of MyPlayer mode since I got the game, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. My current player is a 6'3"" scoring point guard, and I was drafted by the Jazz as the 15th overall pick, I believe. Right now I'm averaging 23.5 points a game and 7 assists as well as 2 steals. I play with 5 minute quarters. My overall rating is currently at a 73 and I'm just about to enter the playoffs in my first season. At this point I've basically put the Jazz in a backpack and carried them up this mountain to the playoffs on my own, creating almost all of our offense by myself.

I've seen quite a few threads just about everywhere complaining about the difficulty of the mode, and believe me, I have met your frustrations as well. I still get frustrated sometimes. But I've found a very good balance and my game has been on point for a while now.

Before I begin, a few things:

* Yup, your team is going to suck. They sometimes won't take open looks, defend poorly at times, and won't get you the ball when they should. Get used to it.

* And guess what else? The opponent's AI is going to be wonky at times as well. They'll predict your shots and make wild looks with your hand in their face. Get used to it.

* The post-game interviews are retarded and always will be. I usually pick the 'B' option (which coincidentally is usually the most douche-sounding) but more often than not, even if he ends up sounding like a douche, I still get increases in Team Chemistry, etc.

Now that that's out of the way, we can get started.

* **

* **Racking up assists**

My go-to method for stacking the assists up as a PG is to **call isolation at the top of the key**. Pick a side and take your defender to the hoop. One of the defenders on either the right or left side will usually pull off their man to play help defense, and when that happens, you kick it to the open man for the jumper. If a defender doesn't pull, pump fake and go for the layup. Using this method almost always guarantees me around ~5 assists per game.

* **

* **Attributes to pour points into**

Most of these should be obvious (all of your shooting attributes, steal is very helpful, layup, shooting in traffic, pass, free throw is another great and inexpensive one) but there are a few that I've learned to ignore. For example, speed is almost useless. As a PG, I've also ignored dunk (which I don't see the point of spending points there until maybe after I've maxed everything else) as well as rebounding (which I was never good at anyway).

An easy drill to improve your shooting attributes fast is the vanilla shooting drill, where you need to shoot at certain spots to control them. I can get a Gold in this almost every time, which nabs me +400 SP and a +1 on either my Close Shot, Medium Shot, 3PT Shot, Offensive Awareness, or Offensive Clutch.

* **

* **Scoring**

First off, *don't expect to drive into the lane and not get bumped*. Because believe me, you will. A go-to play of mine is the simple pick and roll. Go to the left or right side of the wing, hold LB (at least for XBox 360) to call for a pick. Dribble off the screen, and if your defender gets behind you, you'll have either an open lane, or a defender will come to play help defense under the basket, giving you an opportunity to pass for an open look. If your defender fights through the screen or goes past it, pass to the screener for a usually easy assist.

When driving to the basket, my usual button presses are an LT (again, on XBox 360) move to shake my defender or throw him off, then a hopstep (press right stick to the right or left after a dribble move), pump fake, and then I go up for the layup. Using this method it's easy to get defenders into the air and force fouls.

My Medium Shot is at a 92 at the moment, and I've found that when all else fails, it's a reliable shot to take and an easy one to make in a 1-on-1 situation. My 3PT rating is at an 83, although I don't take many 3 point shots at all unless I've been left wide open or my defender is sagging off of me majorly.

* **

* **Defending**

Defending can be tough, especially against star players. I usually hold down LT to stay in a defensive slide. I always tap X once or twice to attempt a steal every possession. This is most effective when the ballhandler is about to throw a pass or bringing the ball down the court. Remember to **not** hold forward when you press X to steal, otherwise you'll go flying past the ballhandler and look like an idiot.

Remember--don't be afraid to let the ballhandler take a 3. 10 times out of 10 I'd rather sag off the guy I'm guarding and let him take a 3 then play up in his face and get burned, giving him an open lane and a high percentage look.

* **

A few random tips...

* Don't be afraid to call for a post up play and feed it to your posts. Don't feel pressured as a PG to be creating EVERY ounce of offense--trust the guys down low.

* Don't constantly expect to make every single shot you take, even if it's open. You're just going to get frustrated. There's nothing wrong with shooting 47% in a game.

* I like having my quarters set to 5 minutes rather than anything higher. Sure, if I set them higher, I could probably be scoring much more and my overall statistics would be higher, but I play out every game (and I suggest you do, too) so it's much faster and easier to get through a season this way, as well as less frustrating."	t5_2s84e	True

Jymtarr	34	6	6	"Hey folks, I've done a couple of blacktop tips and tricks posts, and I thought I'd do a quick write up for some of the tactics and strategies I use online in the versus mode.  This mode can be extremely frustrating if you're playing against a ""chucker"" and trust me, you will.  Games where your opponent shoots 30-40 3's are the norm, rather than the exception, so most of what I'm going to run through today just covers how I deal with this problem.  I'm also going to cover a few basketball terms and fundamentals, because although we're all basketball fans a lot of folks don't realize that understanding the rules, terminology, for real basketball make you better at video game basketball.  Some of that may have you basketball experts rolling your eyes, but it's surprising how many people know that zone defense works, but don't actually know what zone defense means, and how to utilize the zone most effectively.

The conventional wisdom for stopping 3 point cheese is running a 3-2 zone defense.  Zone defense means your player is assigned a specific zone on the floor instead of an individual player.  3-2 refers to the fact that you'll have 3 players on the perimeter guarding shots and 2 players guarding the basket.  This front loads your defense and makes getting an open 3 much more difficult for your opponent.

While you're in the 3-2 zone you're also going to want to select the ""pressure shooters"" button.  This is going to cause your players to....you guessed it...pressure the shooters.  This makes a huge difference, for some reason the computer like to dare opponents to shoot the 3.  While a great strategy in actual basketball, it's downright damning in NBA2k.  Steph Curry controlled by someone who is a decent shooter will knock down a lightly contested 3  nine times out of ten.  You have to pressure him on the perimeter, and accept that he's going to blow by you for a dunk sometimes.  That's the price you pay.

Now, you're in the 3-2, you are pressuring the shooters, now what?  Who do you control?  That decision is completely situational, but for me, most times your best bet is the Power Forward.  Why?  Because the NBA actually has very few dominant PF's right now, especially PF's that can shoot 3's.  This is important because you're going to be playing primarily help defense to stop the 3 point shot.  Bottom line is you want to choose the player who's defensive assignment is the least threatening on offense (specifically 3 point offense) due to the fact that he's going to be largely unguarded because you'll be playing help defense.  The reason you generally don't choose your center is because you don't want it to be completely obvious that there are no big bodies in the paint, and he's more likely to be able to effectively guard 2 players for close range shots.  (this may not be true for every team, but for the Bulls Noah is a lot more intimidating/effective under the basket than Boozer)



So, now the actual gameplay:


Step 1:  Make him Cheese with someone else.
So, here are the actual mechanics I'm using in game to stop the 3.  We're in the 3-2.  I'm using Carlos Boozer, shooters are pressured.  As soon as the player they're using to shoot primarily gets the ball, I double team by tapping left bumper.  This typically sends my guards to  double up on a cheeser, this method works especially well on point guard cheesers.  You want to double them right as they cross half court, forcing them to beat you with someone else.

Step 2:  Switching on Defense.

When you're running the double team, it's really important that you're using your PF effectively.  Since both your guards are double teaming, you're going to be leaving another guard undefended, a likely candidate for cheese option #2.    Since cheesers generally only want to shoot 3's and fast break dunk, you really don't have to worry about the opposing PF, so you manually pull your PF to the perimeter and have him guard any open shooters at the 3 pt line.  Don't commit too much, but as soon as you see the ball being passed to the unguarded shooter pressure him hard.  If he runs around you that's fine, but do not let him taker a catch-and-shoot 3.

Now, anyone with half a brain can counter this defense easily.  All it requires is taking the ball to the hoop instead of shooting 3's. But, I find that if you frustrate a cheeser for a couple of quarters and don't allow him to jack up ridiculous 3's all game with any amount of success, they quit.

After that, all you need to do is score.  If they are unwilling to drive to the basket regularly, and you are setup this way they are going to have a very difficult time scoring.  A final tip on offense (and you see this a lot in the real NBA) is make them adjust to you.  If you are lighting them up from midrange with Deng, keep doing it till they double him, and then find the open man and let get in a groove.  If you are posting up with Boozer, don't stop till they have everyone in the paint flailing around at you, if you see 3 guys on you in the paint, you have an open 3 somewhere.  And don't get in a pissing contest and start trying to answer 3 pointers.  These chuckers are the same kind of kids who learned one really cheap move in a fighting game and only use one character, and one move.  Effective?  Sure.  Unsportsmanlike and proof that you are only having fun if you're winning?  Definitely.  Make the smart play, the easy basket is the best basket.

Good luck, keep doing your part to make the NBA2k13 multiplayer lactose intolerant.

TLDR: 3-2 defense, pressure shooters, Carlos Boozer DPOY, double team that cheese, help defense, 45 second long replay every time he airballs.

1357426395.0	1612mr	MyTeam: The Great Disappointment	Mintiendo	32	3	19	"&amp;nbsp; Before 2k13’s debut, I was ecstatic over the fabled new mode, MyTeam. Building your own team, buying your own players, and playing them against other players’ teams? It sounded perfect. However, with the arrival of this latest 2k installment, these feelings of hope and excitement vanished in the blink of an eye.

&amp;nbsp; To me, one of the most appealing factors of MyTeam was *working for your players*. I couldn’t wait to amass points, and slowly work up to buying my first superstar (Personally, I had Durant in mind). With the advent of Virtual Currency, these dreams were crushed.  This game went from what I expected to be one of my top 10 gaming experiences, to a money grubbing, poorly disguised rich kid VC store.

&amp;nbsp; Not only is MyTeam just a thinly veiled attempt to persuade us to buy VC, but it (along with the rest of the game) is also lacking on a number of possibly game-saving features. Among these missing features which should be considered standard are:  

* &amp;nbsp;  **Private games**. The ability to play with your friends alone would make MyTeam *worlds* better. 
* &amp;nbsp;  **The rosters do not update over time.** For example, Damian Lillard, the breakout guard for Portland, started the season at a 71 overall. Now, he is in the low 80’s. However, because the MyTeam ratings do not update, Lillard is still at a 71 in MyTeam. This kills the “living factor” of the game, in which how a player would play in real life dictates how he is in-game. The players’ performance affects only their price (which is already too high), and not their ratings.
* &amp;nbsp;  **Trading**. Although I could almost imagine how an argument could be made against trades, there is much more demand *for* them than *against* them. Considering that we’re progressively advancing, many of us with separate play-styles and team compositions, trading is a much-needed feature. Suppose my team is deep at the backcourt slots, with Stephen Curry, Rajon Rondo, James Harden, and Manu Ginobili. In a random stroke of luck, I come across Mitch Richmond in a Booster pack, and now find myself with too many front court players. Instead of selling one, I could trade one to a friend to help fill a position I’m lacking in (For example, Manu Ginobili for a good Center). But let’s expand on this. Perhaps we could have a trade market; a web-wide trading block of talent, where you could post your redundant players one night and have a bundle of offers the next morning. I feel this would provide a sense of “I am playing with tons of people, and we are all unique”, compared to the current “Get matched up with 1 person at a time” mentality, never seeing more.

&amp;nbsp;  Despite the lack of these basic features, VC is **definitely** the MyTeam killer. The prices on players are just plain ludicrous, and no one (especially not your casual gamer) has time to *earn* the VC to pay for them. Thus, the only viable option to attain multiple superstars: Buying VC. Not only do they make the players too expensive, but now 2k lets us know that 2k13 is nothing but a cash grab.  When your options are extreme amounts of playing time (with both MyCareer and MyTeam being the least efficient methods of gaining VC despite being the most hyped modes) and buying the currency, most people with the money to spare will choose to buy it. I find this despicable.

&amp;nbsp;  But it doesn’t stop at buying the players. No, based on the quality of the players and their upgrades, **you have to pay VC to even play**. Get 2 quality players with upgrades, and you’re playing at a net loss every game, requiring more and more VC just to play. With a perfect team, the cost to play a single game can be over x5 the reward. VC is a broken system which supports a broken mode.

&amp;nbsp;  All in all, MyTeam had the potential to be the greatest NBA 2k game mode, but turned out to be a colossal disappointment and mockery of gaming progression.

Or feel free to discuss random thoughts and such about the upcoming NBA 2k14 title.

Personally, notwithstanding the fact that I'm most likely going to buy the game anyway, what would really put this game over the top for me and make it a must buy would be the reintroduction (no Jay-Z pun intended) of Signature Styles and Momentum Shots. They could even possibly add more of them, making it even more awesome.

Also more signature things in general like fixing signature layup packages and whatnot. Imagine performing Steve Nash's finger roll in next gen atmosphere.. Or imagine them adding more layup packages for more prominent guys like LeBron (he has a few contact layups that are so successful because of his size and strength) or Steph Curry (does a lot of left handed floaters and such to score in the lane due to his lack of size). And so on.

Crew would also be nice.

What would probably make this game a deal breaker for me is if they focus nothing on improving gameplay and hinge entirely on getting purchases from casuals and others due to the fact that it's going to be next gen alone.

Come on 2k, let's get some solid gameplay this year. I expect a few glitches, but next gen more than makes up for that.

With new gen technology, in terms of potential for 2k the sky is the limit right now. Will they deliver? I'm cautiously optimistic."	t5_2s84e	True

----

**Defensive**

1. Guard your player closely, but not too closely so he can't easily get around you. Use right analog stick to keep your hands in the air to automatically contest any shots/passes. Also, make sure you're guarding the man you're supposed to (the opposing player will have a light bluish-green color highlight beneath them on the court)
2. Simply guard the man you're supposed to.
3. After taking your shot, get back as quickly as possible to avoid the CPU going on a fast break.
4. Do *not* try to steal the ball as often - it'll likely just result in a foul.
5. When trying to rebound, try to time your jump perfectly (just like in tip off); don't try to select every player and jump all at once - it won't work.
6. Always guard the player you're supposed to be guarding. He'll run around on the court - don't lose track of him though, otherwise he'll be open for an easy scoring opportunity!
7. Refer to point #2 under 'Miscellaneous.'
8. -Adjust coach sliders that set fast break and defense pressure in the 90's. -Play a 3-2 zone, control the PG and float around the top of the key/3-pt line to surf for steals -When driving, especially 1-on-1 or 1-on-2 situations double-tap circle and your ballhandler will do a spin move almost impossible to defend if timed correctly -Throw alley-oops on fast breaks, it gets the PG hot as well as the dunker -View all of your players skill sets, especially if they have signature skills, and exploit them -Use pick and rolls, especially with dunking centers. (via /u/PeterGriffin24)
9. Let your defense do their thing. Even if the CPU's offense is in the paint and is backing up for an otherwise ""easy 2"", don't feel the need to switch to your defender to make a play, because chances are you'll just end up fouling them in the process anyway, allowing them an ""And 1"" opportunity.


**Offense**

1. Reconsider your shot selection. Don't take shots just because you can; instead, pass the ball around (carefully) and try to find your best option.
2. Spread the ball around. Try to give all your players an opportunity. If you keep to drive it in with your big man, chances are, they'll start double-teaming him; in that case, drive it in and then kick it back to an open man for a 3-pointer when they lure their other defender in.
3. Pass the ball around carefully. Sometimes the CPU's defensive awareness can almost seem telepathic; a risky pass will often result in an interception, and you won't to minimize those as much as possible.
4. Shoot from all over the court. Give wide-open players the most opportunity. Try not to shoot in traffic unless you have to, or have the ability to pull it off.
5. Avoid as many turnovers as possible by making safe passes. Don't get cocky and try to do risky passes - just get the job done.
6. Call your own plays. Set play art to full. Call ""floppy"" plays for your 3 point shooters. There are all sorts of floppy plays. The common thread is that there is an off ball screen for your shooter which often ends up with your shooter getting a wide open look at a 3. (via /u/calamityphysics)

**Miscellaneous**

1. Use substitutes often. Bring players in from off the bench even if your starters' stamina/fatigue is only at 85 - you'll want to make sure you always have fresh players on the court.
2. Lower your ""crash offensive glass"" setting under your coaching profile. This will help prevent the opposing team going on a fast break.
3. The more aggressively you play, the more likely you're going to lose your lead. Just remain focused and keep trying to score/prevent them from scoring.
4. You also need to know who you're playing with and who you're playing against. Know their strengths and weaknesses, know their tendencies, know what kind of shots they do best (off the dribble, dunks, etc). At hall of fame you will need to know how to guard players like Kobe who will make nearly every shot if you don't play amazing defense. Also I disagree with substitute often. I would say develop a good rotation instead. i always have one go to guy who can do iso if their d is really good. (via /u/pethebi)"	t5_2s84e	True

1354730096.0	14bz8v	How to play my team and succeed.	AndyNemmity	36	10	20	"I just wrote a long comment, and figured I might as well make a post on this. There's a lot I didn't include in this post and can add. I have tons of tricks so far on how to play all bronzes against all golds and win by 20 or more. Here's the comment...

Myteam is a great mode, and it's a ton of fun. It seems like most people complain because they feel they should have the same quality team or better.

If unlike them you enjoy a challenge and want to become unstoppable at the game, then it's a great mode.

Step 1. Learn how to coach.

Almost every coach in the game is set to help defense a lot. This is because in the NBA you can't switch sides fast enough with out the help defense recovering. In NBA2k13 you can... so you need help defense set to 25. You must manually do this every game.

Most players only offense is to run towards another defender, the defender gives help leaving his man open, they pass to the open man and hit the shot.

No help defense, they are in trouble.

Step 2: Set everyone to TIGHT defense in defensive settings on ball. Set everyone Deny Ball on off ball defense EXCEPT Korver/Dunleavy/Novak style 3 point shooters. Set them to tight.

Step 3: Only get players with good defensive ratings. Especially defensive awareness.

You can only control 1 of 5 players every time. You need good defenders to hold their own at all times on the other players.

Here is a list of good bronze defenders.

Tony Allen Thabo Sefalosha Raja Bell Brandon Rush Patty Mills

Step 4: Rebounding

You're going to force them to miss shots, so you damn well better get every rebound from them or you're wasting the missed shots you're forcing.

Best Rebounders -

Reggie Evans Joel Prizbilla Anyone else with an A

Step 5: Pick a playbook, and run the plays in it.

Learn your plays. Go into exibition pro and run your plays over and over until you understand them.

Start with calling Right Block with your point guard, and hitting A, and hitting A again. This will always be this point guards play. What is it called? Learn it.

Go into coach settings and turn on full play art and all the play functions. Auto plays you call, etc.

Run the play 20 times in a row. Learn how it moves. Learn how it reacts.

Then move to RB / A / B

Then run the auto play for several exibition games occationally calling your own plays. Work in a feel for when to do what.

When you run a real offense, you make everything so much harder for the defense.

Then go into real games against humans and do the same thing. Only if they run man.

If they run zone, you need to just break the zone. Here's how to break them.

2-3 - Shoot 3s with Brandon Rush / Raja Bell / Patty Mills 3-2 - Put 2 guys in the same zone, and make the open one shoot 1-4-1 - Either shoot a 3 in the corner, or take your point guard and run to the middle. It screws everything up, get used to do this and you can find open guys, and what I do is actually lay up over and over going straight...

It'll take time to learn the pace of this.

Then you move on to move advanced stuff. Know how to score on a 1 on 1 fast break with a bad player?

I can give you several answers... people who use good players would never know how because it's all too easy for them.

For you, you could 1 on 1 fast break with Reggie Evans fine... because you only play with bad players against all star teams.

Great stuff.

1358052380.0	16h62l	The most intense playoff run of my 2k career.  Where Amazing Happens. 	erickety	31	5	12	"After two seasons in the league, Easy Breezy was living every young player's dream.  He was the centerpiece of a blossoming franchise, the New Orleans Hornets. He was popular.  He even had countless awards, even winning the league's Most Valuable Player after his second season.  Breezy and Anthony Davis were one of the most talented, popular duos in the NBA, gracing New Orleans's billboards, the covers of magazines, and TV commercials.  

===============================================

Yes, Easy Breezy was living well, but there was still something missing: the ever elusive Championship ring, the key having a storied career, the most important artifact that turns mere great players into legends.  Breezy thought he and the rest of the Hornets were poised to run through the playoffs last season, but naive complacency reared its hideous head.  The Oklahoma City Thunder, still graced by the likes of James ""Manbeard"" Harden, Russell ""Apparently still has a ton of potential"" Westbrook, and Kevin ""Doesn't give a fuck if you put a hand in his face while he's shooting"" Durant, stopped the Hornets in their tracks, ousting them from the playoffs in 6.  Breezy wasn't likely to forget the bitterness of this memory soon.  

===============================================

Entering the 2014-2015 season, the Hornets ambitions were as high as they've ever been.  The hunger in their eyes instilled fear in their opponents, and they were rolling, winning 24 of their first 30 games.  A number one seed seemed imminent.

===============================================

Then, disaster struck.  In the middle of the 31st game of the season, Anthony Davis hit the ground hard, and didn't get back up.  A post game MRI revealed that Davis, the Hornets second-leading scorer and rebound-machine, had torn his MCL.  The diagnosis may have stated outright that the Hornets would be limping into the playoffs, dreams of a championship broken to pieces.  Monty Williams took to work that night, considering his options.  Could the team really be successful with Robin Lopez, who played the highly controversial ""full-retard-newborn-baby"" style of offense, as their starting center? No, it was impossible.  Carlos, the Boozeman, Boozer would have to take up the reigns at center.  This would mean Al-Farouq Aminu would have to slide to power forward.  It was inevitable that the teams rebounding would suffer.  With two players playing out of position, how would the Hornets fare? What a mess.

===============================================

The Hornets did, indeed, suffer on the boards that season, and did, indeed, limp into the playoffs, capturing a three-seed.  They'd face the Steph ""doesn't understand the concept of missing a jumper"" Curry and his Warriors in the first round.  The Warriors, however, were an undersized team.  This left them vulnerable to Easy, a 6'8"" guard, and his sheer ability to go hard in the mufuggin' paint.  With an astonishing disparity in points in the paint, the Hornets handled the Warriors in only four games.  Good luck next year, Steph. 

===============================================

Round 2: King James and the Phoenix Suns.  Phoenix's market operations last offseason, acquiring Kyle Lowry, Taj Gibson, Lebron James, and Nikola ""flex your pecs"" Pekovic, proved fruitful, and they captured the second seed in the west.  The Suns' biggest concern proved true, however, and the Easy Breezy-Wes Johnson matchup unraveled the series.  After splitting in Phoenix, the series returned to New Orleans, where the Hornets took care of business, turning the series to 3-1.  With momentum on their side, the Hornets shut the mouths of Phoenix fans everywhere by taking the final game of the series handily, moving on to the Conference Finals for the second year in a row.  

===============================================

In the locker room after the game, the news came in.  The Hornets would be facing the Thunder for the second year in a row, a fact that shocked no one.  Breezy tried to work through it in his mind: Westbrook has only improved, but they lost Battier to free agency last off-season, and their bench is subpar.  Yes, if they could contain the Thunder's stars, their bench was surely better than OKC's, with Austin Rivers having just had a breakout season as the Hornets 6th man behind Jrue Holiday.  

Thinking it was one thing, but doing it was another, however.  Oklahoma City reminded Easy why they're called ""Loud City"", and the team rallied behind their team.  OKC was running great offensive sets, getting their guys open shots, and knocking them down.  When they weren't running great sets, they were hitting their shots anyway.  The team looked unbeatable.  Before Breezy knew what happened, his Hornets were down in the series 0-2.  It was a terrible feeling to brood over on the flight back home, but the team turned it into motivation.  

In game 3, Breezy and the Hornets played a tough, close game.  They put on a clinic in clutch and free throw shooting, leading by less than 10 for the entirety of the second half.  Still, though, it was a win, and a win that they needed badly.  The Hornets were feeling good leaving the locker room that night, eager to get back on the court.  They held that feeling into the next game.  They came to game 4, and they conquered game 4, holding the Thunder to under 45% shooting for the game and winning by almost 40.  Breezy would say after the game that they wanted to make it clear to the Thunder that they would not roll over in this series, that New Orleans is a scary place to play for other teams.  The series was tied up, each team winning both games at home, but the Hornets had momentum going back to OKC.  

They brought that momentum all the way through the 3rd quarter in that game 5, leading by 6 in loud city moving into the 4th.  You could tell just by looking at Durant that he was ready to turn Beast Mode into Overdrive.  He had been having a dominant game, shooting nearly 70% with over 45 points, and was not in any mood to drop this game at home.  Unfortunately for Durant and the Thunder, however, Easy Breezy was hungry.  Hungry for winning, hungry for hype, hungry for a championship, hungry for greatness.  Up 2 points with 45 seconds left on the clock, the Hornets had the ball, a full shot clock, an opportunity to send OKC fans home silent, and OKC players back to New Orleans with their backs against the wall.  With 35 seconds left, Breezy received the ball, Harden set up in front of him.  16, 15, 14, the shot clock was running.  11, 10, 9, Breezy calls up the reliable Boozeman for a pick on Harden.  As if they knew it was coming, Westbrook rushes over to Breezy to deny his movement.  5, 4.  Spin, no one's open, stepback, launch over the outstretched arm in front of his face.  *swish*.  The Hornets are up 5 with 10 seconds left!  What an incredible shot.  Still, Breezy knows the game isn't over.  After a few free throws and some good shot defense, it was, however.  Wow.  The Hornets are flying back to New Orleans with the series in their hands. 

===============================================

The Thunder were all but defeated, however.  Motivated going into game 6, they were matching the Hornets shot for shot in the foreign waters of New Orleans.  The game was tied up going into the 4th.  With 35 seconds left, the Hornets were up 3, looking ready to move into the Finals for the first time in Breezy's career.  After running some clock, Jrue ran into some trouble.  ""Ball, ball!"" Breezy, cried, but James Harden was one step ahead of him, cutting in front of the pass, stealing it, and calling a timeout immediately, 12 seconds left on the clock.  ""No 3's."" was all that Breezy heard during the timeout, but nothing said during a timeout could possibly prepare Easy for the bone-rattling screen that Serge Ibaka laid on him on the inbounds pass.  Catch, shoot, swish, overtime.  The furious shouts berating the refs from the thousands of fans couldn't change that.  The Thunder brought that momentum into overtime, going 10/11 from the field and taking game 6.  Breezy couldn't believe it.  The series was in their hands, and they dropped it.  The best opportunity to take a series against the league's best team was right in front of them, and they let the door close.  Game 7 would come soon, and it would be in Oklahoma City, and it would be the most important game of Easy Breezy's young career. 

===============================================

Breezy went to bed restlessly that night, dreaming of a championship trophy too far to grasp, a ring that didn't fit his finger.  It was unpleasant.  

His fears were confirmed at the beginning of game 7.  Since the opening tip, the Thunder looked like a more determined team.  Faster, stronger, more cohesive.  They simply wouldn't allow the Hornets to get themselves into it.  ""Calm down, there's a lot of basketball left to play,"" Coach Williams kept telling the team, but after every timeout things would only go worse.  With 10 seconds left in the 3rd quarter, Russ Westbrook drove past Jrue Holiday to slam home an emphatic basket, increasing the Thunder's lead to 15, and sending the fans into an uproar.  Then, it hit him.  Breezy was sick of being worried about losing, sick of the Thunder and their gigantic bandwagon, sick of these refs and their excessive reach-in calls.  He felt something awaken in him then.  Demanding the ball with 6 seconds left, Breezy drove around the 3 point line, planted, shot, and drained it, savoring the instant silence that derived from those 3 simple points.  

===============================================

The 4th quarter was a grind.  It seemed as if the Thunder could sense the presence of the monster that had been born from Easy's mind, but they were helpless to it.  The Durantula, however, was  a monster in his own right.  Shot after shot went in from both teams, but where the Hornets were getting open looks around the basket and escaping double teams, the Thunder were settling for outside shots, and the Hornets slowly crawled back into it.  They were down only 1 with 38 seconds left, and the crowd was nervous for the first time that night.  

===============================================

Breezy was inbounded the ball, and just stood there.  He took in the crowd, the other team, the lights, the sounds, the feelings of everything that was happening around him.  Jrue was to his left, the Boozeman around the paint: that was all he needed to know.  10 seconds left on the shotclock, and Boozer didn't need to be told that Easy wanted a screen.  Ghost step right, quick back to the left, and Harden never sensed the Alaskan brick wall that had been built around him, smashing into it and falling to the ground.  Breezy cruised left, cut back right around that fat asshole Kendrick Perkins....

...and.....

SLAM.  

Silence.  The Hornets miraculously take the lead, threatening the sure title that the Thunder fans had taken for granted all season long.  

But there were still 15 seconds left on the clock, and the Thunder were only down 1.  Timeout, inbound at halfcourt.  Jrue blocked off the inbound to Westbrook, and Harden received the ball.  Standing there, waiting, 8, 7, 6, whistle.  Good foul.  They'd inbound again, but there's no time to set anything up.  This time, however, they do get the ball to Westbrook, but clutch defense by Jrue forces him to pass to Durant.  Not like they're sacrificing much by doing that.  4, 3, 2, , everyone around the country watching, hand in his face, puts it up, rim, rim, rattle, roll, buzzer...

NO GOOD!

It's all over! The Hornets win! The HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORNETS win a dramatic game 7 in Oklahoma City, shocking OKC fans and sports watchers everywhere! This was truly one for the ages.  

===============================================

On to the Finals for Breezy and the Hornets.  Having been so wrapped up in his own series, Easy had been completely shut off from outside news the entire time.  He thought it safe to assume that the first seeded Bulls would roll the overachieving seventh seeded Bobcats, having been up 2-0 last time he checked.  He was shocked to see then that in game 3 of that series Derrick Rose tore his MCL, leading to a complete collapse by the Bulls, who dropped the series in 7.  Breezy had to laugh at the familiarity of that misfortune for the Bulls fans, and also about how now it seemed all but uncertain that he would be capturing his first championship against the Bobcats in this series.  Still, though, there was business to be done.


Wish him luck.

That off season, I had to rehaul. I signed a new headcoach and went on to free agency. Perhaps the biggest move I've made so far; I signed Melo. With a lineup of CP3, Lous Williams/Curry, Melo, Smoove, and Horford/Noel we're tied 3-3 in the finals against the Thunder. This is why i love association mode! 	t5_2s84e	True

I just completed a great high point in my career and it was a long road to get there.

I started my career with a so so performance in the Rookie game and ended up on the Mavs. After a year of performing well, I get traded to the Heat. I play a solid season from the bench again and we make it to the finals and win. Only one title under my belt on the Heat and me getting fed up with minutes led to years of trading around to multiple teams that didn't give me time to really show my potential. I spent an entire season playing for the Celtics with a team riddled with injuries and bad trades. After not making the playoffs, I realized I am not suited to be here. I demand a trade and the GM thinks he is throwing me under a bus, but that marks the great to Brooklyn. 

Right away, I come in and start performing. With my PG, I rack up alot of assists with Williams and gain a starting position mid way through. Then I become a center piece for the franchise, even being asked by the GM what player I feel we should bring to the team. Joking around and not caring, I recommend Anthony Davis. Turns out, we get him. Now we have a solid outside and inside team. We start performing and make a solid seed in the playoffs. I did key games through the playoffs and has sweeps all the way up to the Finals.

We go down 3-1 to the Thunder, and begin to work our way back up. After 3 games, we tie it up and play at home. The Thunder come to win and it is a dirty, mean game throughout. Not alot of fouls, just solid coverage and makes from both sides.  No team goes ahead by more than 5 and in the last 30 secs of the 4th, we are down by 4. I beefed up myplayer's 3 point shot and consistency for this moment. I go for a mid range shot and hit it. Then on the inbound I run up and tip it for a teammate to catch and he passes back to me behind the line and I drop it in. We go up by 1 with 12 seconds left. 

The game isn't over yet. The Thunder bring it down the court and are wanting the last second shot. They pass it around and back to Westbrook, so I run up and call the double team and myself and Williams are holding him up and he throws it up at the buzzard...........off the rim.......We WIN AT HOME!!!!

I smile, wipe the sweat from my hands and watch the presentation. I had waited 5 seasons of working hard on teams that just didn't care before landing on the Nets and accomplishing what I was meant to. It felt good to just accomplish something that grand AND make MVP for the finals.

1339780712.0	v3p3x	NBA2k12 and me: A love hate relationship	Jymtarr	27	2	19	"I love NBA2k12, if I never play it again I will have gotten my money's worth.  It is a great game.  However, it is really frustrating that a few small issues keep it from enjoying it's status as one of the greatest sports game of all time.

1.  Multiplayer options.  There should be a 2v2 3v3 mode. I don't mean NBA jam style, I mean you and a friend (or two)  controlling a team, and another group of 2 or 3 controlling the other team.  Right now, if I want to team up with my friends I can play the computer (Which has it's own host of issues)  or I have to team up with strangers who are typically not great teammates.  In fact, in team up mode one of the most common tactics is to annoy your teammates so badly that they end up quitting leaving only your group of friends.  I see this all the time, calling time outs right as you  drive to the basket, refusing to pass to you ect.  Playing with your friends is more fun than playing with strangers, this is a pretty well established rule of multiplayer gaming.  This is a Sports game, it's all about competition, give us more options to compete in the way we see fit!

2.  This may not be an issue with everyone, but I find the fact that injured players aren't available in versus mode to be a pretty poorly executed system.  For one, once your team is knocked out of the playoffs your full roster should be available.  I would also be fine with 2 versus modes, one where you can use every player that is a memeber of a certain team, and another (ranked?) where current rosters were used to determine who is available to play with.

It's a video game.  I play to have fun.  Injuries aren't fun in real life, and they certainly aren't fun in a game.  When I'm playing a game, why do I care that the player I'm using sprained his ankle last week?  I just don't understand the logic.

3.  Fatigue and substitutions in versus are out of control.  Fatigue should be scaled to quarter length, if you use your starters for the entire game they should be nearly dead/unplayable. by the end.  If you full court press the entire game, your team should be completely exhausted.  If you attempt to steal every. single. inbound pass then your player should again, be exhausted from the extra effort.  If this game wants to be a basketball sim, then give people a deterrent from playing like cheap bastards.  There is a reason players don't play this way in the real NBA, it's just not feasible.

4.  Run speed, this issue has been pretty well hashed out.  Dwight Howard should not be able to run down D Rose on a breakaway.  Duh.  (Not that it matters because neither of those players are currently available in multiplayer, how fun!)

5.  There should be an incentive to use teams besides the Heat and Thunder.  Each team should have a rating, if you are using the Bobcats, and beat the Thunder, you should get more benefit than someone who uses the Heat to pound the Bucks.  It won't take much. A point system where you can buy Shoes/ old school jersies/  maybe even some sort of system where you can acrue points to spend on using A legendary player for a game. (Obviously not in ranked)  Give people a reason to pick teams that aren't loaded with Superstars.  Having to quit 15 matches ina  row because I don't want to play the Heat isn't very fun."	t5_2s84e	True

1372624690.0	1hdt4f	Luke Ridnour	ehopkey	27	5	39	has anyone noticed how ridiculously overpowered he is???? he has incredible midrange, layups, 3's, good passing and ball handling and is only like 71 overall. he is also really good at defense. so today this kid chooses the heat online (of course) so i pick the timberwolves and just decide to destroy d wade the entire game. luke ridnour had 34 points on 17-30 shooting and made the game winning shot. the secret you may ask??? HIS FLOATER!!!! it legitimately DOES NOT miss, ever. period. i did 12 floaters during the game and he only missed one because he got fouled. i've  made a team of the best pg's in the nba today and historically and practiced floaters with all of them. after 20 floaters from the middle of the free throw line with all of them ridnour made the most: 18. out of everybody, including people like magic, cp3, tony  parker, oscar robertson, jerry west, stockton, etc.....cp3 was the second best at only making 15 of his 20. either a developer in 2k was a huge ridnour fan or just decided to make one player have beautiful floaters to troll people. so now you all know how to make your friends rage. i recommend using him in all game modes because he can't be stopped  	t5_2s84e	True

Iammattieee	28	5	9	"Just played a game where I was up by 15 points with less than a minute to go and the computer was still going extremely hard on defense as if they were close to winning.  Also after they scored with 11 seconds to go, I was still up by 13 and they were still hounding me when I would inbound.

I would like for a more realistic tone like the real NBA, when teams are down that much they don't try so much in the last few seconds because there is no way of a comeback by then and they have accepted defeat.

1370187277.0	1fit9t	What Improvements Would You Give MyCareer Mode in NBA 2k14?	scooper1030	25	3	76	"For me, I have a few ideas. First, not every player wants to be a superstar. I think they should let you choose the role you want to play, whether that is a role player, sixth man, starter or superstar. For example, you could choose to be a sixth man, and that way the rotation would keep you out of the starting lineup and give you a max of 25 minutes per game instead of going all the way up to 40 or 41. 

Also, bring back the salaries from 2k12. I don't care if they keep the VC system or not, just pay me an actual amount of money in free agency, and have the contracts go up (if you deserve it). Currently, your contract is pretty much exactly the same even after the first three years. 

Also, let us do more with that money. It doesn't have to turn into The Sims, but buying accessories, or even seeing your house, car or crib in the game mode would be awesome. Also, have us hire an agent, and then that agent would be the one contacting us with sports deals and endorsements.

And make those Team Chemistry and Local Fan Support sliders mean something. If I'm pissing off my teammates, they shouldn't be passing me the ball as much. If I'm pissing off the fans and I'm on a cold streak, let them boo me. I love the MVP chants right now, but they can hate me too. 

If I've contributed a lot to a specific team, once I retire, have a ceremony in the arena where they retire my jersey. That would be awesome.

Obviously, fix some of the gameplay issues. There are too many fouls. Maybe I'm just choosing the wrong time to go for the swipe, but in addition to leading the league in steals I'm seeing my PG get 3-4 fouls per game and occasionally foul out in the fourth quarter. The CPU should shoot more from the outside, we should be able to block dunks, and there are other little improvements to make as well. 

Those are just my ideas. What would you guys do?"	t5_2s84e	True
1369668619.0	1f52zw	My career story. Denzel Diamotopolus	DRphoenix99	29	6	8	"6'4"" point guard athletic style of play.

I started this my career based on something I read from another /r/nba2k user. I wanted to make a point guard that would average as many assists as possible and keep my points under 15. But I didn't like the pass first style in creation so I chose athletic and then pass was the first thing I upgraded.

Rookie showcase: I did amazing. I ended up with 14 points, 23 assists and 4 rebounds. Only problem was my 6 turnovers. I ended up getting drafted 13# by the Philadelphia 76ers. I did good on the team but I could barely grab any minutes from Jrue Holiday since he was a pass first pure point guard and I wasn't going to play shooting guard. I wanted to assist.

Trade: I requested a trade to the Atlanta hawks, the Indiana Pacers, and the Detroit Pistons I wanted a team without a good point guard but Miami just seemed too easy so I went elsewhere. I ended up getting traded to the hawks for Deshawn Stevenson. I'm thinking once I become a superstar one day this trade will look like rookie Kobe  for Divac. I took the started spot after just 5 games.

I was unhappy with Horford because he was undersized and couldn't rebound well in the game due to his low vertical. I requested a trade and ended up receiving..... THE BOSHTRICH

My lineup.
Denzel Rustempasic (85)
Lou Williams (79)
Dantay Jones (74)
Josh Smith (87)
Chris Bosh (84)

Why is the players name different? Is you remember a post a little while ago about someone firing everyone on their suns roster and then auto signing players. That was me, I got a guy named leftirs Diamotopolus, and someone in the comments suggested I change my last name to this to hear the announcers say it. I did it was hilarious.

Back to my player. I was really happy with Louie, he has a quick shoot and his 88 in medium shot was racking up alot of assists. Same with bosh and smith. The problem was jones, he was 6'6"" and the SF and he never took a shot! I wanted him out. Here's where it got interesting.

Trade: dantay jones and josh smith, for David lee and Harrison Barnes!

At first I cried I had lost Smith, but I was happy to have an upgrade to the SF spot.

Boy was I wrong! I loved lee! He could shoot just as well as smith, but he had a 91, 93 in rebounding and could bang in the paint even harder then smith, the only problem was his defense, lee was terrible as a defensive PF, I didn't care though. 

My lineup:
Denzel Diamotopolus (91) 
Lou Williams (80)
Harrison Barnes (76)
David Lee (85)
Chris Bosh (85)

Everyone on my team was going up! And we were the best offense in the NBA and I averaged 13.7 points, 24.9 assists, and 4.5 rebounds. 

The playoffs! We went 57-25 and got the 2nd seed, we beat the bulls in 4 easy. Beat the nets in 5 but all those games were close. Then came the Heat. Now with horford as their center and LARRY SANDERS AT THE 4. I have I idea how they got him. Anyway this team was crazy, we played them in the eastern conference finals and it went to a game 6 with us down. I played so hard, I got 27 points 36 assists and 0 rebounds in that game. I was on fire, we won and it went to game seven, sadly in the end they were too much, starting

Dwayne Wade
Ray Allen
Lebron James
Larry Sanders
Al Horford

We couldn't handle them. But I vowed revenge. I was going to come back and beat them next year, I MADE ATLANTA THAT PROMISE!

Next season starts and all our ratings but 1 go up.
Lineup 
Denzel Diamotopolus (95)
Lou Williams (84)
Harrison Barnes (79)
David lee (82) he went down 
Chris bosh (84) 

With my upgraded wings my team went 73-9 that year! I've been saving all my data to write this story and I end the story with us now in the playoffs, after beating the bucks, now facing the heat in the conference semis. I VOW REVENGE

I didn't notice it until I found Elton Brand grabbing an O rebound, spinning over on the other side of the smaller defender and laying it back up and in, rather than doing that god damn mechanical ""contact shot"" throw up. 

Then I heard commentators saying ""Triston Thompson already have 14, yes! 14 rebounds, how about that,"" something I have never heard of.

And one time playing against Bradley Beal, I was surprised to find him actually using screens and big men actually screening people, and if I try to go above the screens to catch up with (or wait for) Beal at the 3 line, seeing how mechanical and predictable these catch and shoot plays used to be in NBA2K, Beal retreated a bit back into the corner just so I can't reach him, and he got to catch the ball for an open shot, just like the way it is in professional basketball. Not once, not twice, he did this Ray-Allen, Richard-Hamilton stuff all game long, scorching me for 43 points. 

I haven't seen those unguardable leaning layups for a while, nor those pump-fake-then-sudden-forward-thrust layups. If there are some they are tweaked in a way that makes it believable, and it makes all-star big men (Dirk, Duncan) are now much more potent and dangerous around the rim. More realistic I should say. There are a lot more but I can't describe actions in words, so you've got to try it yourself.

They didn't fix the invincible standing dunks though, nor have they fixed the pass input queue up, and I hadn't gone far enough to check if generated rookies in Association are still having ridiculous layup, dunk, and consistency ratings and the bulging 3pt shooting tendency even if they can't shoot.

The best i've ever gotten from contesting a dunk is having the dunker blow his dunk and in most cases all contesting has ever gotten me is giving up an and1.

Whenever a dunking player starts his animation/momentum nothing a defender does can stop him. The dunker will literally push the defender out of the way in some sort of cheesy glide.

1373725166.0	1i7v0h	List of 2K13 issues?	Anton_Barrels	26	4	32	"An opportunity to vent and discuss issues.
Let it be known that I love 2K13. 

Some that I can think of off the top of my head:

* On Ball Steals. The system in place now is that if you press steal, it will almost always be a reach in foul. Your player will essentially smack the other player. This almost makes the steal button useless in on ball situations. It seems like it is in place to eliminate spamming of the steal button, but it was taken to the extreme in my opinion. I would prefer if you could always steal the ball if it was in the open, but the AI would be smart enough to hide it away as they dribble, like in real life. I could be swinging away at the ball that is right in front of my player but it would either not poke it lose, or it would be a reach. 

* Dunking and Animations in general. This seems more difficult to fix. When 2k13 was about to be released, they were talking about how they had a ""physics engine"" in the game, and it would be noticeable in gameplay. In reality, Josh Smith can just run straight at their whole team and enter his dunking animation, displacing all of the defenders, causing them to slide away to let him complete the animation. This applies to other animations as well, in that they displace their defender, making it seem like your defense had no effect. 

* Double Teams - Let's say that im currently being double-teamed. If i'm LeBron, I'd like to see Chalmers realize this and then go hover around the 3pt line, or maybe Bosh cut to the rim. No teammates really ever realize ""He is being doubled, I should do something."" 

* Sagging off of Shooters - All to often, especially in association for some reason, my team mates tend to sag off of three point shooters way too much. I know that there are ways to fix this and limit their stupidity, but I really shouldnt have to.

* New Online Policies - I can only earn VC if im online. I can only have 3 total ""saves"" that earn me VC. I can have at max 3 different MyCareers that I can use on blacktop. You can buy VC for real money. MyTeam is so VC intensive that it is almost required that you have a lot of VC to do well/have fun, prodding you to buy VC. "	t5_2s84e	True

For me, I've never been able to score consistently with Kevin Love, I mean, hes a got a good shot but I find hes rarely ever open to take it and he is not quick enough to create his own. His post game is good as is almost every big man if you can back them down and you know what you are doing.

So who are some great players in this game that you just can't find consistent success with?"	t5_2s84e	True
1373059781.0	1hpph5	WishList: GM Mode	CharliePancakes	25	5	13	I know we have a dedicated association mode where you are in charge of a team. But I'd like to see a mode thats more in depth in being a GM. Where you can get fired and go to different teams. Where you negotiate more, deal with frustrated players, or upset owners and aren't expected to play. It would be cool to read reports and have training camps come out of budgets.	t5_2s84e	True

1371475250.0	1gii38	What's your biggest regret/mistake in your MyCareer?	MajorLeagueNerd	25	4	34	"Mine sucks... I was a Center for the Cavaliers and everything was going great. We were number 1 power ranking, the whole team was doing amazing. Then they asked me to make a trade so I choose a couple of people and without thinking, I choose Dwayne Wade. Well they get Dwayne Wade and we lose Kyrie. My goal was to take Kyrie to get a ring so I was really pissed because we made great teammates. He was number 2, I was number 3, and together we made a Michael Jordan lol.

 Well I hate Dwayne Wade, he's awful on my team so I ask for a trade to Heat to get back with Kyrie. My overall is only 83 so I assumed they wouldn't get rid of him so I went for it. I asked for this trade 3 days before the trade deadline and I go to play my next game and the GM wants to talk because he found a team for me. What team? The Toronto fucking Raptors. They are dead last in the whole NBA. I hate my life.

1366926660.0	1d416h	MyTeam in 2K14	Naly_D	25	3	12	"I know there was the suggestion thread for the game as a whole the other day, but I figured one just for people's problems/suggestions for MyTeam could be good.

Here's mine:

* Lower 3pt sliders. A LOT. The other day I shot 73% and lost to a team which shot 43%, because every shot they put up was a 3. I did all I could, but Curry, Kobe, Delfino and Rashard are hard to defend. Also the current system seems to penalise those who play inside.

* Improve on-ball IQ. Related to the 3pt gimmick, it's insane that you can set defensive pressure to 100% and people can still drive then back up to the 3pt line and fool the AI. Also the whole sprinting along the top of the line thing.

* Create an auction block. Guaranteed, the rarest cards are all owned by 3% of players who've all gotten them multiple times because they spend hundreds on packs. Why make them discard them for 500 VC when there is a demand for them?

* Exhibition challenges with more VC rewards. Playing the Dream Team, the Redeem Team, previous NBA All-Star teams and NBA winners. Maybe make your way through each NBA team by division and meet a historic/All-Star team at the end?

* Reward underpowered teams. Bronze teams going up against LBJ, CP3 etc aren't staying for the measly 250 on offer atm. Give individual VC rewards (say 5 VC for winning the rebound battle, 5 for most assists, 15 for staying within 10 of a team with 3 gold players when you have none etc) to teams.

* Make teams/VC more sustainable. I understand 2K's whole intent is to make money - but look at EA's Ultimate Team model. I've easily spent 3x as much money on 2K as in Madden or FIFA to get a comparable team. They'll love that but it's not gonna continue long-term."	t5_2s84e	True

Like rules you stick to when trying to have a successful game.	ygrn	24	2	26	"I play man to man defense until my opponent starts going inside a lot, at that point I set up a 2-3 zone and control my center to protect the inside. I try to get all of my players hot at the beginning by starting with inside shots early. I also feel like it's easier to get wide open 3s on your opening play if your player is trying to establish his first shot. I use hopstep, eurostep, and spinmove religously when driving to the basket. 

I like to stick to only taking around 14ish 3s in a game. I feel like I lose a lot of games by having missed like 10 3pters. 2pters are much easier obviously. But if I'm making it rain I gotta keep it going. 2k cheese is 2k cheese.

I do A LOT of pick n rolls and call for screens a lot. 

I always set up double teams on other star players if they are on the drive (obviously I wouldn't do this for players who don't drive well).

1331571662.0	qt3ws	Rigged AI No Longer Tolerable	sirmcquade	29	9	18	"TL;DR - I'm at my wit's end with the CPU. I might be beating a dead horse, but I'll gladly be the 1,000,000th guy to wantonly bitch about the AI. It's seriously fucking ridiculous; **please share your cheap AI stories so I know I'm not alone!**

I have a stellar team in our online association, with D-Wade and Kevin Love leading the way. It's a blast playing other guys in the league; the games are thrilling. You know what's not thrilling? Losing by 20 to an AI team with NO STARTERS RATED OVER 72 - ON PRO DIFFICULTY.

You know why this happens? It's not because I'm inept. I have no troubles when I play a human player. Yet when I play the computer;

*The AI decides when and where it scores, no matter what kind of D you're putting up. The other day a CPU Kevin Durant went 14/17 against me, as well as 5/5 3pt shooting, being DOUBLE TEAMED THE WHOLE GAME. And not just with the defensive setting on; I PERSONALLY double teamed him with Kevin Love anytime he touched the ball. It simply doesn't make sense; he inexplicably decided to shoot FIVE 3-pointers over double teams throughout the game, and lo and behold SWISHED ALL FUCKING FIVE. Pro difficulty my ass...those shots were rigged to go in. KD shot 86% that game. 

*The AI sabotages your defense to gain an advantage. Friendly AI players will run in bizarre, erratic patterns and lose their man completely. Perimeter defenders will sprint into the lane for no apparent reason, leaving the AI wide open for 3-pointers that it basically never misses. [This black dude knows what I'm talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwBhr1j5V8M&amp;feature=related) This will occur RAMPANTLY if you're ahead by a large margin.

*The game is atrociously buggy. [Clipping issues will often render your defensive efforts completely useless.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrUCmRCOMyI) I've noted dozens of occasions where the AI will shoot a VERY well-contested 3-pointer, get an 'A+' on shot quality feedback, sink it, then the commentators describe a ""total lack of defensive effort"" on my part. I think if you angle your defensive player the wrong direction, or maybe if your block timing is just a hair off, the game completely eliminates your defender from the equation. So i.e. Durant can swish a 3 over a double team because the game does not register the defenders in his FUCKING FACE.

*The CPU defense is OMNIPOTENT. If I pass upcourt during a fast break, there's a 95% chance the AI intercepts it. Without even turning or seeing the play, AI player will ALWAYS know where your pass is headed. Furthermore, AI post defense is fucking impenetrable. [Another black guy knows what I'm talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjNkuDi7QZc&amp;feature=related)

So I got a player out of 20.67% of packs. 
Of that 20.67%, 29% were gold, 38.71% silver and 35.48% were bronze.


I'd like to say i'm happy with the results, but considering my biggest need in my lineup was a gold center i'm pretty dissapointed. Yeah I got Daugherty but he really isn't too great. And when I got that Dominique Wilkins only to realise that I already had him a little part of me died. 


With the lineup I already have I really only see myself using Kobe, Dell, Bullard and maybe either Bridges or Daugherty. "	t5_2s84e	True

Here is the EXACT comment -MyCareer - Personal relationships with your own teammates. For example if you make a nice pass to a team mate your personal teammate grade with him and you will see it go up with a green +3...and maybe a green +1 around other teammates for recognizing your nice pass. It could go the other way for taking bad shots, hogging the ball when you aren't a proven prolific scorer etc. I know it would be difficult but it would be cool to maybe also receive texts or tweets from your teammates pumping you up for a big game or congratulating you on a nice game.

Basically, Carmelo and Felton seem way faster, better at shooting, and better at defense than their ratings would suggest. Melo is better than LeBron in my experience. Defending Carmelo is essentially impossible.

1355021412.0	14j28x	I find the steal button useless with the latest patch.	madden2399	25	7	27	In the latest update, they increased the percentage of fouls when you are trying to steal the ball when you are defending. I honestly think that this made the stealing button useless anymore. Every single time I try to steal the ball from somebody, I get a foul called on me. To me, I see the steal button as an automatic foul button. It is always on the first attempt of stealing. I try to keep from stealing the ball, but I have no other choice. Even when it looks like it will be a perfect, clean steal, I end up getting a foul called on me. This has made me so mad, and made me ragequit so many games. I don't know if this is just me or not, I haven't seen anywhere that fouls are getting ridiculous. Does anybody have any tips on how to try and get a steal without committing the reach-in foul? I would love to know some different techniques so I don't end up going in to the bonus every quarter of a game I play.	t5_2s84e	True

In Game 7, it was the closest game of the entire playoffs. Back and forth, great basketball. I drain a three pointer to tie it at 135 with a minute left. Golden State calls a timeout. THE COACH FUCKING TOOK ME OUT OF THE GAME. I was having a 45/4/13 game and HE SUBBED ME OUT AND WE LOST THE GAME. This is my contract year and I am leaving the team immediately just because of this.

I made an amazing team in team creator and played many years with it. When Kobe retired, I didn't do anything at first. But the next year I made a good trade for the first overall pick to try to get the next Kobe possibly and when I simulated the draft in the offseason, I noticed I drafted someone named Kobe Bryant. After signing him, I looked at my roster and saw that he was a 95 overall, 42 year old, Kobe Bryant. I guess he loved the game too much and came back for more. This was on the Xbox 360 version of NBA 2k12.	t5_2s84e	True
1341462724.0	w2a0y	Why 2k12 is broken and what needs fixed. 	BlackThunda	28	9	16	"**Gameplay issues that need to be fixed:**

* Directional passing with the A button never seems to go to the intended target, i never pass without pressing RB first.

* Incorrect blocking/charging foul calls (restricted area doesn't exist.)

* Steal rating frequency (my point guard should be able to protect the ball without getting picked nonstop.)

* Reach foul tendency too low (your guy can get hugged without the refs calling anything.)

* Defensive Clutch is too good. (I'll be down by 1 with 20 seconds left, isolating with Kyrie... kobe will knock the ball away and get an easy fast break dunk, puts me down by 3 i lose. I've had multiple scenarios where my PG has been picked like that.)

* Contact in the paint is just ****ed, it's impossible to stay infront of bigs on defense without them doing an animation and sliding by you.

* Slow closeouts on defense. (When contesting jumpshots, my defenders float slowly to close out somtimes... why?)

* my A.I. players on defense should NEVER jump on pump fakes. (maybe get raised up on their toes, but my pf/c far too often jump off their feet and give up a free dunk at the rim.)

* Turnaround jumper way too effective (almost automatic with any superstar, maybe 50-70% from the field)

* The spin jumper (not the post move one), is soooo slow, completely useless. 

* The bank shot control is poorly designed. 

* The up and under is way to good. (not the post move, but the open space one with bigs where you press X real quick and then shot stick towards the hoop, ALWAYS goes in.)

* Spin dunk (needs to be removed entirely)

* Alley-oop frequency might be a little too high

* Dunk frequency/dunk in traffic needs to be toned down, i think it would be more rewarding to get a powerful slam maybe once or twice a game rather than 10 windmill dunks.

* Free throw frequency too high (maybe make them 5-10% harder to make)

* Dribble moves need tightened up, it feels slow and clunky, and the Y button needs to be brought back for step backs, not that slow step back animation. Hopstep needs to stay out, but damn, it's impossible to get any seperation anymore. 

* Make dunks more realistic, i'm tired of seeing lebron/wade windmill over a 7 foot center. I know this game will never be a complete basketball sim, but i'm not trying to play NBA Jam.

* The post up move when you press RT and push towards the middle and your guy stumbles into perfect position by some miracle every single time discarding the defender. (needs to be removed)

* Bigs are too fast

* When guards have an open lane to the basket, the go into an animation giving bigs time to recover and block shots. Guards should make a quick move to the basket instead and finish with the correct hand to avoid blocks best they can.

* Floater FG% seems a bit low, even in practice mode you shoot about 40-50% with floaters.

* Mid range % seems high, seems pretty automatic with most players.

* 3pt % off the dribble is too high, pulling up in traffic for 3 should be a very, very low % shot, lebron/melo, star players seem to rain them.

* Fouls should NOT be called on players ""Get fouled tendency"". it makes players too good, say lebron is a 98, but his tendency to get fouled is 95, he would be drastically better than someone with a 0 tendency to get fouled, showing flaws in 2k's rating system. Maybe that should be factored into overall rating, but i could slash ALL game with the Cavs and shoot 5 free throws, Lebron can get to the rim 3 times and shoot 6.

* So many wonky canned animations, the one animation where guards jump, cross there legs, and shoot a floater fading left across their body... WHO SHOOTS LIKE THAT? and the stupid, dive for the ball and flip it back in bounds animation works like 1% of the time, the players move waaay to slow. 

* Shot stick/X button responsivness.... I've had dozens, upon dozens of times where i've had a wide open dunk, press down X or hit my shot stick only to have my guy run under the hoop and directly out of bounds. 

**AI:**

* Spacing, spacing in this game is so turrible. I feel like i'm watching 1st graders in a YMCA league. Giant cluster fuck 3/4 of the time.

* Defense assignments, players randomly stray off assignments

* On the fast break, when you attempt to throw a pass to the wings, the A.I. will run directly under the hoop into defenders resulting in a turnover.

**Misc:**

* Why, WHY can't we save playbooks, profiles, defensive assignments, roations or camera angles?! changing this every game blows. you could save all these in 2k9! WHY TAKE IT OUT?!

* Ratings are so off in this game, not gonna get to specific because i don't feel like looking them up, but Dwade is what, 35% shooter from mid range? in 2k his mid range is like 90, he's automatic. Tyrus thomas has a 3pt shot, things like that.

* My crew games were the most fun part of 2k11, if you guys could get sufficient servers and eliminate the hacking, and implement a better way to play player vs. player defense, but you're probably strides away from that.

* Court size still seems small to me even though they've said they have improved it... everything just seems cluttered. May be due to the spacing issue.

* Let me play a season with friends! i dont know WHY you took this out, it was in 2k10!

* Commentating could be a little more creative other than telling me the Cavs, ""Went from top to bottom last year, no pun intended."" Every couple of minutes. "	t5_2s84e	True

Fastforward to gameday.  The first quarter is rough and I know I'm in trouble.  Even though Danny G is red-hot with 16 on 6-9 shooting the Milwaukee crowd is already getting rowdy and there are still 36 minutes of basketball left.  At least that's what I thought.  

The second and third quarters are a whirlwind of errant shots and broken ankles.  The Bucks are getting to the rim at will and I couldn't hit sheet metal with a magnet.  At least with anyone not named Granger, who has 35  The BMO Harris Bradley Center is rocking as the teams prepared for the fourth quarter.

Fastforward again, there are 28 seconds left as I bring the ball up the court, down by two.  The ball goes to Granger.  Postup.  Step-back jumper.  It's good.  The crowd is silent.  Overtime.

Onto the extra period.  Again, as time winds down I'm bringing the ball up the court, down by two.  The ball goes to Granger.  Screen.  Hard drive to the basket.  The layup is good.  Double overtime.

At this point I'm sweating bullets and probably look like I'm having some sort of heart failure.  I've been yelling, whining, throwing things, basically looking like a 4 year old before bathtime.  The sixth and final period of basketball begins and I fight and claw to stay with the Bucks.  Granger is out of his mind with 57 in the game.  Up by three with 50 seconds left, the bad guys convert a three-point play.  I'm going ballistic and trying my hardest not to shut off the game.  I give the ball to the unconscious Granger, who calmly hits a three.  My hopes flicker, but deep down I know the sad truth.

I get a stop on the other end and stand near mid court with the ball in Danny's hands as the seconds tick away.  9...8...7...I start to dribble towards the right baseline and call for a screen.  It comes up, I squeeze by as close as I can.  An open look.  The shot goes up.  2...1...

- No matter how low a person's rating is, they should make the simplest of layups. I play with the Spurs, too many times does Tiago Splitter miss a layup, just because of a defender is standing in the area, not even contesting the shot. I'd like to see a better rate of finishing layups.

- Flashy dunks in a half court setting is just ridiculous. When would you ever see someone drive the lane and do a 360 under the legs dunk? Keep it to the simple one handers, reverses, whatever.

- Too many short passes flying over players heads. For example, I just played a game and Danny Green grabbed a rebound, tried to give a short outlet pass to Tony Parker, but it soars over his head. There was no defending, no attempts to steal. Just went flying over.

1373479290.0	1i0st0	Suggestion for new rating system	ffosb22	20	5	5	"So I've been thinking about a new way to do ratings for 2k13 (which I love, but there's not enough variability). I don't think it would be ridiculously difficult to implement and I think they have the makings of it sort of in the consistency rating.

Every player should have a range for their non-physical attributes and every game, it should randomly generate what their attributes will be for that game based on their consistency. For example, LeBron is almost always good, so his range would be something like 95-99 OVR and his other ratings would reflect that. Somebody like JR Smith, however, would be like 70-90 or something considering how inconsistent he is.

In order to keep it more accurate (for example JR Smith is more often good than bad), you can weight certain ends of the spectrum, so he would end up higher more often than not.

This would also help the draft because players in the 2nd round could have a high ceiling, but their spectrum is weighted highly toward the 50s. It also could make scouting interesting as you hone in on a players range and reveal more information about how consistent they are. 

I just think this would make a more enjoyable and realistic experience. Thoughts?"	t5_2s84e	True

1368639784.0	1ee83w	I've played 312 games of myplayer blacktop: Thoughts, Tips, and tricks.	Jymtarr	20	2	12	"I guess I should start off by saying that I'm really surprised how much I ended up liking this mode.  My friends and I wanted to team up and play together, and there really are surprisingly few options in regards to co-op play.  We settled on blacktop for these reasons:

1.  It uses your myplayer.  Using your created player is really fun.

2.  You can dictate what position you're assigned.  If you are doing a quick match team versus match, where where are divided and assigned two random teams. You have zero say in what position you are delegated to. I generally play point guard, inevitably one of our big men gets put at point, and I'm stuck with Andrew Bogut, and neither of us are able to really take advantage our our strengths/roles.
In Blacktop, you are able to choose who you have at the 1,2, and 3 slots.  It is determined by the order in which you join the party. (Host is PG/1)

3. It's a versus mode, not a co-op versus computer mode.  The computer is fucking hard in this game.  Competition is fun, playing real people is fun.  If you want to play against others while still being able to choose what position you play it's really your only option.

I was pretty...apprehensive. Checking the ball after ever play seemed like it would really slow down the gameplay, and it does...but not nearly as much as you'd think.  Also, the first time you get in a game with a guy who is nailing fadeaway 3's with a hand in his face all day, it's really easy to lose hope.

But, there are a few signature skills that can really turn the tide in your favor.

1.  Lockdown Defender.  If you only have 1 signature skill, this should be it.  It turns off all of your opponents signature skills, and it causes your player to stick to the offensive player like glue.  It really levels the playing field against the guys who have Deadeye, Shot creator, Spot-up ect.  Without even having to do anything you strip those weapons from his arsenal.

2.  Scrapper.  Defensive Stops and being able to recover loose balls is key in Blacktop.  When your team turns the defense on lockdown mode, you want to be sure your guys come up with the ball.  Scrapper makes a huge difference.  Also, make sure you're tapping X (on Xbox 360) to dive for loose balls and recovering bouncing balls.  I've have come up with miracle loose balls by diving through other players for recoveries.

3.  Anything that adds % not + skill points.  When you start winning games, it doesn't take long to rack up the VC.  I easily make 1000 VC an hour, without ever feeling like I'm grinding.  You are going to be 99 overall a lot quicker than you think.  Those + skill point abilities just aren't going to effect you.  This is unless you have a sub-100 cap ona  skill due to size/weight.  + skill signature skills push you beyond the ""soft cap"" but not beyond the ""hard cap"" of 99.

Offensively, you really have to throw everything out the window that you learned in career mode.  Alley-oops are often times a great option.  Fade away 3's are nothing to shy away from.  Find a few plays that get you easy baskets and use those.  Also, remember that since the games score a two point basket as 1 point and a three pointer as 2 points, 3 point shots become TWICE as good as a regular basket, making them way more valuable than in a regular NBA game.  As with any basketball game a balanced attack relying on easy baskets and OPEN 3 point attempts is key.  Switch your strategy midway to keep the other team on their toes.  Been feeding it to the big man?  Switch it up and rain a few 3's on them.

This is probably way longer than it needed to be, but I feel like a lot of people skip over this mode.  It can be Cheesy, but there is something to be said for the fact that I laugh at loud multiple times a play session at some of the ridiculous myplayers you come across.  Jackie Moons,  Micheal (sic)  Jordan Jr.,  and more Swag related names than you can shake a stick at.  It's a big part of the fun.

1297627931.0	fkovp	DAE hate how screwed up My Player mode is?	EvanConover	19	2	20	"Here are the things I hate about My Player mode:

* You start off sucking worse than the worst free agents.  Even after the combine and summer training, an injured Yao Ming on 1 leg is still of better use than you.

* Your teammates play more retarded than a middle school team playing their very first game together.

* Is it so hard for your teammates to play defense?  They'll allow 3-pointers to get knocked down because nobody puts a hand in the face of the shooter.  Apparently, you're supposed to run over and contest every shot.

* Block or steal attempt that did nothing and no harm done?  DOWN A LETTER GRADE!  Are you a 5’11” guard that couldn’t block the shot of a 6’8” guy?  DOWN A LETTER GRADE FOR LETTING HIM SCORE!  Stupid teammate can’t catch the ball?  THAT’S YOUR FAULT!  DOWN A LETTER GRADE!

* Win the last 2/3 games, head coach gets fired.

* The 2K Insider (Just a cartoon Stephen A. Smith) only wants to yell at you when you suck.

* Call a timeout.  There are 29 songs in the game, yet it’s always PLEASE GIVE ME SOME THING TO CALM ME DOWN!  That song probably gets played over and over again to remind the player to not lose your shit over losing to the Kings by 20 due to trying to save shitty teammates with your retarded player.

* ""If You’re Happy and You Know It"" will always be the last song every arena will play with 10 seconds to go in the game."	t5_2s84e	True

* Fantasy Draft, unless the general consensus is no fantasy draft.
* 14 or 29 game season
* All-Star difficulty
* Id like to try and get at least 20 users, if not more.
* We could post the weekly power rankings and stats, and vote on the MVP/Rookie of the Year/Coach of the Year/All-NBA teams on this subreddit.
* If any of you particularly want to be commissioner, you can.  I'm not sure if I want to be the commish.

I was playing with the Houston Rockets as an athletic but slightly undersized SF (6'6"", 210) and this was with the current roster. I asked my GM to trade for an upgrade at either PG (I'm not a huge Lin fan) or C/PF. One of the players I targeted was Kyrie Irving and my GM listens and trades for him.

1355533796.0	14vfnh	From lottery team to champions: Orlando Magic	Crunketh	18	3	9	"Orlando Magic hired Crunketh as their GM after the Dwight howard saga. 

First franchise moves:

* Extended Vaugns contract
* Fired current trainer and hired an A trainer for faster recoveries


I did not want to have a losing team so i took a risk and made a bunch of moves. 

* Signed free agents Delonte West &amp; Kenyon Martin
I made a bunch of moves, the league thought i was crazy. Traded some key players for Steve Novak, Jason Kidd, &amp; Rasheed Wallace. Then traded Steve Novak, Hedo Turgolu, &amp; JJ Reddick and a 1st to houston for Chandler Parsons and a noob which gave me a bunch of cap space.

Eventually I had a great starting lineup with too much depth at the 4 &amp;  3 and started off 5-15. I was the laughing stock of the league, a team destined to get the lottery and i threw it away to have a contending team. I knew i needed to make changes and I did. Eventually i ended up with this team. 

* **Jason Kidd(PG)**, Andre Miller (Role)
* **Iggy**(SG), **Jason Richardson**(SF), Ronnie Brewer (Role)
* **Shawn Marion**(PF) Chandler Parsons (Prospect)
* Rasheed Wallace (6th), Andrew Nicholson and Jujuan Johnson as Prospects
* **Anderson Varajeo**(C), Kwame Brown &amp; Mozgov as Bench players

Iggy became my star 1st option, Varajao my 2nd, and Shawn Marion my 3rd option. Gave the bench as much minutes as possible and had the team play very unselfish. 

We finished 4th in the East. We swept the 76ers in the first round and the Knicks upset the Heat in the first round. Knicks put up a tough match but we managed to beat them in 7. It was the Nets &amp; Magic in the ECF where the Nets just didn't stack up and fell short 4-1. 

Hoping the Lakers would make the finals so we could rub it in Dwight Howards face for leaving but they just didn't have it in them and lost 4-2 to the Thunder in the WCF.

Game 7 Thunder vs Magic and Rasheed Wallace goes 6/6 in 3 pointers in the 4th to seal the deal and the Magic are the 2013 NBA Champions. (Only game i played)

I miss an awkward contact layup, but manage to get my own rebound and get an And-One. We need this this free throw, and although my free throw rating is a 45 I manage to sink it. Down by one with 2 minutes to go thats plenty of time. So much time in fact coach decided I needed a break to catch my stamina.

So I did a fantasy draft with the Magic where I could only draft 75 overall and under. 29 game season, no trade override, player roles off (because it's unrealistic how some 50 something rated bench player complains about getting no minutes)

Don't remember everyone I draft but a few I remember were Barnes, K. Thompson, T. Thompson, Birdman, Swaggie P, and Asik.

Later on I acquired Terrence Ross through a trade.

My team did horrible the first season (simmed the entire season).

Ended up with 7th pick in the draft and drafted McLemore.

Tanked the 2nd season and drafted Wiggins at 1st pick.

Someone traded me 7th pick for some prospect so I took it and traded the 7th pick for Isiah Thomas and a 1st round pick for next year.

Ended the season at 3rd in the east, my player in the 1st all-rookie team averaging 19pts 4reb 2ast.

Then ECF against the Heat (1st seed), it was a frustrating series since my Celtics wasn't strong enough to keep up and my player and my skills aren't that good either. I ended up losing 4-3, with the Heat moving on to the NBA finals vs the Lakers who ended up sweeping the Heat. 2nd season's start was similar to the first, more losses than wins. Lost many players - Green, Dooling, Wilcox, Collins and got 2 rookies (C and SF). I realized that the team had a weak inside presence both in off/def and asked the GM to get a strong PF or C. I also wanted Avery Bradley to be traded since he was inconsistent with his shots and prevented me from starting at SG. GM ended up trading Bradley/Fab Melo for Faried/Mozgov. The trade made a big impact as I started winning more games. Won most of the 2nd half of the season and ended up finishing 6th. My player should have won 6th man of the year, but i was starting more by the end of the season so i didn't qualify. Averaged 25pts 5reb 4ast. 1st round of the playoffs was against the Heat. I was confident since my team was more balanced and I was generally better at the game at this point. I swept the Heat surprisingly and move on against the Pacers (2nd seed). I won that series 4-2 and go on to ECF against 76ers. I swept that series and move on to the Finals. For some reason a 7th seeded Utah Jazz beat the 2nd seed Lakers in the 1st round and 3rd seed Spurs in the WCF. This Jazz team had Nate Robinson as their starting PG, George Hill as backup PG and the default Jazz frontcourt (Jefferson, Millsap, Favors etc.) I swept them in the finals, winning the championship and receiving the Finals MVP award. 3rd season, again started similarly losing too many games at the start of the season, went on a 11 game losing streak (superstar difficulty) even though I averaged 30+ pts, beating the team record by scoring 51pts in 1 game. I tuned it back down to All-star difficulty. I started winning games again and got back to .500. My Celtics team is getting old now (KG, Pierce, Terry) and starting to be inconsistent in offense and defense. I just finished playing the ASG, with my player playing 10mins and scoring 15pts, lost the game because East decided to have 5 PGs, Monroe and a hurt Bynum as the only Centers and J.Smith as the only real PF. Im currently averaging 30pts 6reb 5ast (leading scorer). I play 10min quarters on All Star difficulty (1st season - Pro) and on Simulation sliders. I like how realistic my career is going so far apart from a couple of team stats and a high FG% due to the minutes played."	t5_2s84e	True

1354585117.0	148hs2	What needs to be changed/added in NBA 2K's Association Mode	iAmLeeper	16	2	9	"Im writing this as I am watching my Bobcats take on the Kings in the 2028 NBA Finals. I am enjoying this game so much this year, but the one thing that doesn't seem like it expanded was the association mode. It's the same as last year. I want some differentiality in this game! Here are a few issues I had and maybe a few solutions. I'm typing this for Ronnie2K and LD2K and whoever is in charge, but I'm just posting it to r/nba because I have no way to send it to them. But anywho, let's take off:

**2k's Generated Draft Classes**

This one is huge, especially once you get farther down the line. Everybody looks the same! It's really unique to see some change in people, but I have 3 guys on my team that has cornrows and a headband. Kinda insane.

**Easier Way to Simulate**

This one is a huge one. I often forget to check my roster, and people get upset with playing time a lot. When someone gets injured or heals, I think we could have a set lineup that we like to use, not what they recommend. Because a 65 overall player on my team was constantly at a 58 just because I wasn't giving him enough time, and I agreed with him that he needed more time. I think that would make things easier.

**More realistic Trades**

I don't like how I get a trade request every other day in this game. It's be better to look at if they were even reasonable, too. Like one time I had Biyombo (a 84) and westbrook offered for 79 and 65 with lower trade values. TF? I don't even look at them anymore and just have them always say no.

**Ability to change Jerseys/Court**

This one is a big one too. I know its possible, too, because I know you could in Madden 06. It would make it feel a little bit more realistic if the kings and bobcats had some upgraded jerseys from these old things. It's not a necessity, but itd be cool if it was included.

**More realistic Player Emotions**

Westbrook is just gonna leave Durant after 5+ years when his level was at 100? I don't think so. It'd also be cool to have people who stayed on the same team for a while follow that person. Like if Durant went to Sacramento, Westbrook would accept (almost) any offer. Idk, just a thought. It'd also be pretty awesome to hear some storylines behind these players. like I could imagine ""Well ____ and ____ have been playing together for a few years so they have a close relationship"".

Oh, and this is a question for people who simulate a lot - Do coaches ever die? Like I've had the same coach for all 16 years. I know thats not a long time but I'm excited to see what happens to him after 100+ years lol.

Overall though, I love this game! The association mode is pretty amazing if you know how to draft/pick up free agents/simulate, so keep em coming 2K!

Oh, and I almost forgot! Make it able to retire numbers, too!"	t5_2s84e	True

Was obviously the best option. Nope. 6th man. I tried everything. Trying to get Bradley traded, or Doc fired, nothing worked. Finally said fuck it after weeks of frustration and said I wanted out. Guess who was interested. Lakers. And they went through with the trade. Me for Kobe Bryant and a first round pick. It is the weirdest thing to see Kobe in Celtic green. Now #4.

1349341184.0	10xf04	Any trades in Association or MyCareer you're particularly proud of?	taylusbaylus	16	1	31	"It seems to me like the GM in MyCareer listens to you a lot more in 2K13 than in previous iterations.

The trade I'm so far proud of is in MyCareer, I got drafted with the 10th pick as a 6'3"" scoring point guard going to the New Orleans Hornets, which is baller, I love playing with Anthony Davis.  I felt like we could definitely use more size though, so I recommended a few players to the GM, one of which was Roy Hibbert. So the trade went:

Pacers trade: Roy Hibbert, Paul George
Hornets trade: Eric Gordon, Xavier Henry

Getting rid of Eric Gordon wasn't great, but I actually much prefer Paul George due to his size and dunking ability.  So our starting lineup is now:

PG: Me
SG: Paul George
SF: Al-Farouq Aminu
PF: Anthony Davis
C: Roy Hibbert
with Ryan Anderson coming off the bench as a sixth man.

Honestly the team is pretty great.  It's difficult to take the ball into the paint against us with both Hibbert and Davis being able to send balls flying into the stands with ease, and on offense being able to space the floor with jumpers helps them get easy post buckets and Paul George is pretty good at bailing the team out as well.

So far we're 8th in the conference though, our schedule had a lot of the really good teams early but if we make the playoffs I'm confident we can do well.

1345577625.0	ylgpy	Dad needs help with 2K12!	Aaron215	15	1	11	"Hey guys. I've got three boys who love NBA 2K12. I'd like to play it with them, but I've never played a 2K12 game (except a demo of MLB in Gamestop...) and the last basketball game I've played was NBA Jam...

Any tips on how I can at least get to the point where I'm not just a nuisance? I know practice is likely the #1 thing, but I don't have much time to do that. The goal is to get to the point where I can play with them on a team, each of us just playing one guy with a computer 5th.

I checked out the manual and wow.. it's daunting. I also see that just pressing x to pass pretty consistently sends it to the guy I don't want to pass it to, so I guess icon passing or the right stick is the way to go (again, more practice needed). I'm just looking for a good explanation of how to be somewhat competent and not screw up every play.. ever.

Thanks guys! Links to video tutorials are also welcome, if you know of ones that are good.

UPDATE: Thanks a lot guys! I went through the training camp (oh wow that was long.. actually didn't finish it all, as I needed to get to sleep so I could wake up early the next morning) and starting a MyPlayer career this morning and did only one game, but I got a lot of what I needed. We did a 2 on 2 this evening, and I had a hard time distinguishing which player was me (red and orange are similar, they play on ""2K"" for the camera so I'm only really on the screen if I have the ball, and there are tons of arrows everywhere for who is guarding who which confused me) but after convincing them to play on skybox zoomed all the way in, I did a lot better. Still working on those layups and for some reason the right stick didn't work for me for passes, so I'm going to brush up on my icon passing and shots, and I think I'll actually be somewhat competitive (at least with them). Thanks everyone for the advice! It's much less daunting now."	t5_2s84e	True

1366330747.0	1cn84b	Association Dynamic Signature Skills	collectionsalt	15	1	7	"I've found, in my super-deep sim associations I've done, that players lose and gain signature skills as they progress. I've seen it appear more with the generated players rather than real players. This is a pretty cool aspect of long-term simming and player development (I've simmed two associations to 2030) and I was wondering if anyone else had seen things like this. 

One of the better examples was a SF/PF I had on my Knicks. His offensive skillset was somewhat like Lebron James's, maybe with a bit better post moves/inside game. He started at 75 and peaked at 95 or so and then declined starting around when he reached 31 years old. He started with Acrobat, but he gained Finisher, Posterizer, and Shot Creator. 

At his peak, he had Acrobat, Finisher, Posterizer, and Shot Creator. He could basically score from anywhere with skills or athleticism.

However, when he started to decline, he lost Posterizer, Acrobat, and Finisher, along with his athletic prowess. However, the game gave him Post Playmaker and Lockdown Defender, as he had changed his game as he aged.

I thought that was pretty cool, as I've never seen the game compensate for an aging star player with signature skills. 

Also, the strangest set I've seen was a SF who averaged about 11/6/7 for his career. He had Antifreeze, Dimer, Post Playmaker, Deadeye, and Scrapper. He started out with Scrapper only. 

Has anyone else seen things like this? I would recommend simming deep into Associations; it gets weird when today's stars retire, but it's interesting to see fake players develop. The auto-generated draft classes produce realistic ratings, too."	t5_2s84e	True

By the end of the year my starters were kyrie, waiters, MWP, Thompson, and Zeller. So going into the lottery I had the second worst record but came out with the first overall pick

I later put a QO on Wayne Ellington and key all my other free agents go

Heading into the draft, armed with the first, 26th (from the nuggets), and 29th pick (from the Lakers), I go ahead to make my selection. I drafted Shabazz first overall but I saw that nerlens Noel HAD AN A+OVERALL. so I traded my bottom picks and Jordan hill for the heat pick (14, I laughed when I saw them in the lottery) and then I traded Zeller, the 14th, and my 2014 first for the 7th pick and drafted Noel

I saved up a bunch of money with the hope of signing LeBron, but I put an offer for Dwight because why not. I want expecting him to accept but lo and behold he did.  Another FA funny: ben McLemore was projected to go first overall, but he went undrafted (all thanks to the impeccable accuracy of 2k logic)

A few Fillers later and my lineup was...

PG: KYRIE, Steve Blake
SG: DION, Tony Allen, Wayne Ellington
SF: SHABAZZ, Shane Battier, Alonzo gee
PF: NOEL, Kenyon Martin
C: DWIGHT, Brendan wright

1362787968.0	19y01m	NBA2k13 has been released for a few months now, what are your overall opinions/analysis of the game and developers?	azurken	14	1	41	"Was just wondering what people's opinions are in this game. The game has been out for a few months now and I imagine most people have been playing a decent amount of time per week. The reason why I made this post is because personally for me, I've only been playing the mycareer (4th season now) and a couple today games from the main menu, but I would love to know what are other people's experiences for the other aspects of the game so please share!

My opinions: 

Pros-Mycareer/player is very enjoyable definitely feels like a real person and the rpg aspects of upgrading and such and such and working hard adds a good element for players to build on. The settings are very fitting, pro mode= i win by 50-80 points everytime. Hall of fame mode= lose maybe 20% of the games I play and definitely harder to make shots, grab boards, make good passes. So it's a good broad range. There. 

Cons-that being said, there are LOTS of glitches to this game like freezing and such on not just the system but even during the games where the players and ref just stand there and wont make an inbound pass. All star game is still fucked up, and personally I think all these issues could be fixed easily, but I think the devs don't really want to try.

Overall: still a very enjoyable game."	t5_2s84e	True

I love playing MyPlayer, but it just stops being fun after awhile when I win every single opponent by double digits. Assists come so easy off the pick-and-roll, wide open 3s always fall, my teammates make ridiculous 3 pointers as well, etc.

But the moment I turn the difficulty up a notch in an attempt to make it more fun and challenging, I just keep losing by 20 points easily. The opposing team suddenly makes shots at a really high percentage, my teammates can't even finish under the rim, our shots just refuse to drop, everything just doesn't go our way. Pick and Rolls don't even work anymore because it doesn't free up my teammate or me because the opponent just suddenly defends so well.

Any advice would be great as to how I'm supposed to get anywhere near decent at a higher difficulty level. I can't believe how big a difference just one difficulty level makes and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to even keep the score close.

1349277595.0	10vmkq	My single favorite improvement in 2k13 by far.	CommentFiend	15	2	5	"You guys that play online a lot, remember how in 2k12 it was ridiculously easy (compared to real life) to play transition defense? 

For example, I played over 300 games as the Knicks, and every time I was charging down the court, even with Carmelo Anthony and JR Smith running the floor in a 2 on 1, I would still sometimes be stopped by shorter point guards magically blocking my dunks or unrealistically affecting my layups. Whenever Melo' would go to dunk the ball if you did his regular dunk, he would bring the ball so far behind his head, that really short and unathletic players could easily block it from behind by just gently extending their arm. Same happened with many other great finishers.

Anyways, I've played about 5 games online on 2k13 so far, and from what I can tell the transition game is far more realistic. If I'm running with a full head of steam with Melo' and a shorter player is thinking he's going to block my dunk, he has another thing coming. When I'm playing 2k13 the players actually feel powerful, and that is in my opinion the best improvement in the game."	t5_2s84e	True

1347771205.0	zyk0l	NBA2k on the WiiU could be gold... hear me out	lilsamuraijoe	16	4	12	"The touch screen on the gamepad... It's the coach's clipboard. The ability to create plays in NBA2k hasn't been in any of the recent iterations, but it could work very well with the wiiU's gamepad.  Icons representing players could be dragged around, and there would be ways to signify cuts and screens, passes, and such.   You could even do this during the game, in time outs...  Obviously for this to happen, 2k would need to fix plays, because they are shit in 2k12... but given that, I think the wiiU could offer something really cool and unique.  

Also, during the game, there are a number of things that could be shown on the gamepad.  Quick plays could be buttons on the screen, but one idea I had was that it could show an overhead few of the court, with icons representing the players on both teams.  The idea is that you could tell any player to set a screen, make a cut, or just to rotate somewhere.  You could accomplish this by simply selecting the players icon and then selecting where you want him to do the action.

What this brings to the table is more control over our team... often in 2k12, I find my players setting picks on the wrong side of the ball handler.  The gamepad could solve this by having us decide where the pick should go.  Currently in 2k12 when I want players to cut, I have to press L1, select their icon, and then move the left stick in the direction I want him to go. But this is often inaccurate and unreliable.  With the gamepad, we could tell them exactly where to cut.

In addition,  the wiiU controller could make doing things on the fly easier.  Subbing, changing matchups, looking at the boxscore, could be done pretty easily with the help of a touchpad.  

I probably won't end up getting the wiiU, but if 2k implemented this in one of their future games on the console, it would certainly entice me.  Much more so than PS3 move features for the past two 2ks.    "	t5_2s84e	True

Down 2-1 right now, and omg, Tony Parker is GODLIKE.  I've resorted to putting Metta World Peace on him just so he doesn't score 45 on me I'm so frustrated.  

Only problem with this strategy is that they keep posting up Nash with Kawhi Leonard, but I'll take that over Parker dominating.  Manu hasn't really been a factor in my games for reasons unbeknownst to me.  

I've noticed that Duncan has been absent in the series (thank god), so I checked out their roster after the last game and it says he's injured with a sore knee and is day to day.  When I read that, I literally got scared!!!

Man, association mode is so fun.  :o  I'm playing on HoF and I've never won the championship.  Hoping I can come back in the series!  Sorry for the TLDR, but I have to share this with someone and I have no friends that play nba 2k13..."	t5_2s84e	True

I think doing an online association turns people off because of the time commitment and how dependent you are on people staying with the league. An online tournament is easy -- if your opponent no shows you move on.

I'm thinking of adding a pot in for the winner.

It would be a best of 3 game series.

The amount of time to play the 3 games has to be hashed out. It's unfair to ask people to do back to back to back games.

Any of the standard 30 teams can be chosen. If you want to run with the Miami Heat and only score with LeBron, do it.

You can also change teams in your 3 game series.

This is the ground work. More details can be hashed out depending on the interest in this thread.

(Edit for 3/18/13 @ 6:53pm EST)

*This is my first tournament organization attempt, so not everything will go perfect.*

I have two midterms this week, so sign-ups will be ""officially"" open until this Saturday. For new people who see this thread, it will be helpful if you include your PSN in your reply comment. I will contact everyone who left a message in this thread individually so they can give me an e-mail address and their PSN. I may contact you through PSN as well if that seems like a more effective method.

I am going to assume everyone who has already supplied me with a PSN is in. I will organize people alphabetically and then use a random number generator to determine the matchups. Once I contact you with the matchup time, you will have 24 hours to acknowledge you're aware you've been scheduled. 

After that 24 hours, you'll have 3 days to complete your three game series with your opponent. You must work out appropriate times with your opponent. There will be a spreadsheet with e-mails and PSN ids. Schedule conflicts will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but I'll try to assign times on Thursdays so people have the weekend to do the games.

The default quarter lengths will be 7 minutes and the default difficulty will be Hall of Fame. If you and your partner agree, you can alter those settings, but if your partner wants default, that is what you must go with.

KEEP A CAMERA READY! I don't think people will try to cheat, but I think it will be helpful/interesting if you take pictures of the final score and announce the teams you chose for particular games. I'll create a master thread next week that will have everyone's games, and you will have to reply under my comment which has your game announced with verification of who won. Disputes will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but you must reply within 24 hours after the final day your last game can be played on. So for example, if I announce schedules on Thursday, you have Friday, Saturday and Sunday to play the games, and I need to know of the results before Tuesday.

Disconnections will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If someone is down 10 in the 4th quarter and d/cs, take a picture and you will be awarded the win. If the game is in the 1st and you're down 5 and d/c, you will have to replay the game. Not all cases will be so clear cut, but this is the ground work.

I'm also considering having the losers in the first round play each other for a chance to get into the tournament's second round. Just so everyone gets to play at least 4 games. I would delay the second round by a week to compensate for this.

If anyone wants to contribute anything to a money pot for the winner, let me know. I'll put $20 towards an amazon gift card.

I will hold final say on all matters. This is not a democracy! Of course I will listen to people's advice and opinions, but people don't have all day to do back and forth arguing.

That being said, if anyone has anything else they'd like included or altered, leave a comment or PM me.

EDIT: Alright dudes, it seems like there is a decent amount of interest. So we don't have to discuss everything in this thread, I made a subreddit for people in the league. If you plan on playing, join [r/Crossover2K](http://www.reddit.com/r/Crossover2K/) and we can set a date for the draft.

Alright so the most recent league seems to have stagnated before the draft. There is currently 11 members in that league and no one has joined in the last few days so I think it is fair to assume that the interest in an online association on r/NBA2k is around 11 people.

I decided to make a new one because the consensus seems to be that HOF is too high of a skill level for a predominately CPU league, and the commish in the old one does not want to start until there is a minimum of 20 users.

I think a league with 11 or so active users can be very fun, especially when we reach the playoffs. So join this league if you are active, and please don't exploit any facets of the game(i.e. shooting a million 3's with Korver).  

I will be fair with draft date, and if this takes off I will create a subreddit for people in the league to talk/schedule/trade and so on. And if anyone has suggestions on the layout of the league(difficulty, season length, quarter length, etc) I will consider them and create a new one if we all agree.

Association Name: Crossover2K

Password: 12345

The only thing that really bothers me about it is the online franchise. Online league is all my friends and I played in NBA 2K11. So when I heard it was gonna be in NBA 2K12, I was really excited for it. They made it so bad. The things I hate about it the most is that you can't change the draft order. It's something so simple but you can't do it. You can't take the CPU out of the game. Again, something so simple but you can't do it. Trading and simming games are fucked up. They take forever to do and it takes like a good 6 hours to even start up the damn league. The last thing that really boils my balls is that when you eventually get to play your friend in the online franchise, you can't put on the jump shoot indicator on, you can't change your jersey, and your camera settings never save. That's also in online games too. I know this is probably an old problem but I just found this sub reddit and I was interested to see if anyone else feels the same way.	t5_2s84e	True

* First, I traded Danny Granger for Wilson Chandler, the reasoning behind this was to get a lighter contract and a younger player. Also in this trade I swap my first-rounder for next year for their current first-rounder.

* Next, I traded Darren Collison and my first-round pick to Houston for the Cavaliers first-rounder and Samuel Dalembert.

* Finish the season average, just out of playoffs. 

* Second in draft lottery, I get the fifth pick, fuck.

* Trade with Warriors for third pick using David West, my pick, and a second rounder.

* Jackass Rockets end up with the second pick they traded for and got the player I wanted, Thomas Robinson. I settle for MKG out of Kentucky.

* Luck out with my second round pick and get a guy with some potential.

* Entering free agency I only have a couple players under contract, Wilson Chandler, Paul George, and ~~some other guy~~ Tyler Hansbrough. 

* Sign Chris Paul, Chandler Parsons, Ersan Ilyasova.

* Re-sign George Hill, Leandro Barbosa, and Samuel Dalembert.

* Match offer on Roy Hibbert.

* Entering the season trade with the jackass Houston Rockets for Thomas Robinson and Arnett Moultrie using MKG and my second-rounder, Lucas Nociguera (spelling).

* Sign Kurt Stevens as a 0 minute roster filler.

1320290738.0	lyjwb	This Game Isn't Fun 	slyguy183	15	2	11	"There was not a single game this year I was looking forward to playing more than NBA 2k12.  NBA 2k11 was the first game I ever played in the series and it was a revelation.  There was so much to do and so much fun to be had.  Making a playing who could barely hit a jump shot into a dunking, high flying machine was one of the most joyful gaming experiences I've ever had.  I was looking forward to enjoying the expanded My Player edition in 2k12.  

For what it's worth, they did a great job designing My Player.  I like the salary system, I think they did a good job balancing the skill point system.  However, the *game* is not fun to play against the computer.  There are way too many problems the erode the fun level.  I'll go ahead and list the most common ones.

- Computer hits 3's way too often and too easily.  Even scrubs can hit 3's that have no business hitting them.  

- My team's defense is terrible.  Sometimes I'm defending my SF and my teammate guarding the PG will just leave.  The PG hits a wide open 3 and I get penalized for letting my man score.  WTF.  This kind of defense happens way too often.  I wouldn't mind the computer hitting 50% of 3's if my team would bother to contest them better, knowing how deadly accurate the other team is.

- Driving in the game is insanely difficult.  Understandable given how last year was a dunkfest, but they still have to allow my player to move without getting entrapped in animations.  At least last year if you got caught going left, you could recover and go right.  But the AI this year is telepathic in knowing where you're going to go.

- Getting offensive rebounds is nearly impossible.  Every computer will put a body on you somehow, and a 6' guard will box out my 7' SF like a wall.  If I try to jump over him, I often get an over the back foul.

- On the rare occasions I break free from my defender and head to the rim, there's about a 50% chance I will get my wide open layup blocked.  Apparently they don't teach the players how to keep the ball away from a defender.  It's even more ridiculous when a 6' point guard can block my 7'er layup attempt because he starts his shot from the ground.

- On the other hand, when the computer goes in for a layup, he almost always does a spin or hop step layup followed by a fake.  This fake causes all your CPUs to jump and not be able to contest the layup properly.  You're not allowed to ""stick"" to the offensive player while they are making this ridiculously slow move so it goes in practically every time as there is no defensive pressure on them.  Even 6' point guards like Raymond Felton can perform spin moves in the paint against two 7'ers, who somehow find themselves unable to block the shot.

I know there's more but this has gotten way too long already.  **TL;DR** the game has too many AI issues to be fun."	t5_2s84e	True

My friends and I discovered that the ""Brick Wall"" signature skill is amazing for blacktop, Brick Wall causes your screens to knock opposing players down, basically taking a guy out of the play which always leads to an open shot.

Also, there is the always frustrating tactic of ""Hiding in the shade"" on the court with the tree.  Not something We really employ very often, but I see a lot of teams that do.

Another thing that has helped my team out seems obvious, but it makes big difference:  Wearing the same color shirt/jersey.  The only possible downside to this strategy is that it really causes people to bring their A-games when they are playing against a team.  Improves your court vision by 100%.

I'm on my second season so far. Got drafted by ORL as a center. I basically set the game to easy/pro and won the title (yes, i know it might not be fun for you guys). I wanted to be the centeriece for their new rebuilding and we faced the lakers and dwight in the finals. After we beated them, it seems dwight signed back with the Magic and replaced me as starting center so im a 7-1 PF. That really ticked me off so i ask to get traded and after a few complicated weeks. Kobe goes to the magic joining dwight, lakers get westbrook, and i now start as center for OKC now.

Some other interesting things ive noticed....And i know this is only my second season but so much has changed already.

-CP3 goes to Cavs, kyrie is 6th man( iknow this happens to everyone). Kyrie avgs 8ppg lol.

-clippers are a lottery team again, about the 3rd lowest seed in WC.

-Harden and Lin avg about 21ppg/6apg each and are #1 seed in WC. So far i think they were 32-8 for their record. Lin/harden also became an all star for my rookie year. Asik avgs 12-10 a night.

-Rose avgs 30+ppg two years in a row. At one point he was 35 ppg.

-MVP race so far in order is, Rose, Harden, Lebron, Lin, Wade. 

-Wizards are a 3rd seed playoff team. Wall avgs 20ppg/10apg, Beal avgs 17ppg.

-warriors are lottery team even when they have 2 stars (curry and Lee avgs 19/6apg and 19/9rpg).

-Spurs are a lottery team worst record in WC now.

1359398379.0	17fx2o	So should I buy 2k13 or are they just going to turn off the multiplayer for that too? (Power Rant.)	Jymtarr	23	10	58	"Did I miss the outrage in Early November when they shut off the servers for NBA2k12?  I'm having a really difficult time throwing money at a 60 dollar game that I get to play online for less than year.

I LOVE the gameplay for NBA2k.  I get the feeling that there are some basketball fanatics who put their heart and soul into designing this game. Guys  who wanted it to be fun and a true basketball simulation, unlike anything before it.

And then there are the marketing people, or the 2k Sports people, or whoever controls the money..makes the WORST decisions I've ever seen in regards to the consumer, their product, and their marketing.

""Executive produced by Jay Z""  turned out exactly as a predicted.  No gameplay enhancements, no online enhancements, just some shitty Jay Z songs and a hip-hop overlay.  Jay Z doesn't know shit about video games, I don't know why anyone would have expected a different outcome.

The online options are awful.  People just want to play with their friends 2k sports.  Make it where you can do a season with a friend.  Make 2v2 and 3v3 lobbies.  These are simple, simple things that would add so much life to the game.  Fuck new sneakers in game.  Fuck dunk contests.  Fuck putting A 5 MINUTE PAUSE IN AN ONLINE GAME.  Fuck not being able to use injured players (THis is so god damned stupid, I play video games so I don't have to worry about injuries. Just allow the full rosters for multiplayer.  Mind boggling.)  and Fuck Jay Z too.

But, whatever, I probably would have purchased it because the gameplay, as I said is without equal, nothing else is even close.

So about a month ago, I decided to start getting ready for 2k13, I had a little free time, and popped in 2k12 after a month or so away from the game.  Servers down.  Oh well.  Then the next day, servers down.  I read online, they took the servers offline.

Who the fuck are these people at 2k and why do they hate me so much?  Were they trying to prove that it was physically possible for the 2k12 servers to be worse than they were when they were functioning and online?  Do they think it's a way to ""trick"" people into throwing more money at their re-hashed hip-hoppified version of last year's game?

I can't justify giving these people any more of my money.  Why?  So that they can yank the rug out from under me when they decide it's time for me to buy their next completely un-innovated product that is essentially the same game as 2k11 but now we have Jay Z and NEW PIXELATED SHOES!

The only reason I'm even considering paying money for this game is because my best friend lives across the country and we like to play basketball together.  2k shit all over that when they turned off our online play, and it seems like they've taken their ball and demanded 60 dollars or there will be no games.

SO fuck you 2k, I'll probably buy your shitty Jay Z travesty of a game, your asshole marketing genius plan worked.  But, I'm going to ditch you when something new and better comes along.  And I'm not touching any other 2k games.  But, what do you care?  You got your 60 bucks from me for 2k11, 2k12, and probably 2k13 go ahead and turn off your servers that never worked right in the first place.

God damnit, I hate 2k games.  How was there not a bigger uproar about this?  I hate that I missed it, all this bitching feels way late and way pointless."	t5_2s84e	True

I'm playing Association Mode with the 76ers. It seems like he has ""butterfingers"": his passing is atrocious, he gives the ball up too easily, and rarely gets any good scoring opportunities. Defensively, his blocks and rebounds come at a minimal and it often seems as if he's invisible on the court.

1373470352.0	1i0gj3	This game is a disaster... [rant]	ro50	27	16	16	"I've never owned a PS3 game that hard crashes my console more than this one. I have to do a [pretty ridiculous workaround](http://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/18edds/ps3_loading_custom_shoe_data_bug_rant/c9fkw9v) to even get the game to start correctly. But the latest thing to drive me nuts is getting all the accomplishments done for Hall of Fame in My Career mode. I'm in the third year of my career and have yet to make the all star team despite leading the league in assists, steals, 3 pointers made, FG%, FT%, and scoring. My team (the Sixers) just won our second championship in which we swept every team and I was Jordan player of the game each game. The last game of the finals, the celebration animation would crash my PS3 so I had to replay it 4-5 times to actually get the trophy which sucked but by now I expect that from this game. David Stern comes out and awards the finals MVP trophy to our backup power forward Arnett Moultrie who scored a total of 12 points the entire series. Since part of the reason for me playing every game and not simming them was to make sure I made the all star team, won finals mvp, etc this is really annoying. Especially when I broke the single season NBA scoring record. 
I know everyone is so hyped for 2k14 and the next gen consoles but I'm at the point that I don't even want to deal with the frustration. I LOVE the NBA but until 2Ksports starts releasing a quality product and actually providing updates and bug fixes for it I think I'm done. It's a shame they are the only one licensed to make NBA games. 

**TL;DR** The bugs in this game are driving me to drink.

1373319922.0	1hw4fk	MyCareer is honestly just so good!	bobb3h	13	3	13	How many of you still are not bored of MyCareer on 2k13? I've been playing as a SF and winning MVP's and shit and all kinds of new shit keeps happening and I'm wondering how much more new shit can really happen? In year 3, my GM made me choose my teammates in an attempt to get his MVP and All-Star to stay so I got to trade Westbrookfor Cousins for easy P&amp;R assists. I also have gotten 2 commercials now with Jordan and created 2 shoes. I was wondering if any of you can tell me if there's any more cool stuff that happens in 2k or if that's about it (without telling me what happens) like I said I'm at the beginning of Year 4 now.	t5_2s84e	True

So we've got like **+24 million in cap space** in mycareer and I as a pg carry my Houston side to the finals (which has a poor back up 1 guard so I get too many minutes, no small forwards so Paul George [who was the only trade our gm did in 2 seasons, and he wasn't gonna do it unless I said so- I've asked for 5 players and got only 1] plays sf, also the team has a 52 ranked sf rookie and 75+ rated Chandler Parsons at the bench and the rookie plays more minutes than Parsons at WCF against Durant) in the second season. And with that 24 million cap space we sign **no players**, actually let go of our only poor pg backup and sign 2 rookies which are ranked less than 55.

I've played this career for two seasons and I've had enough. I thought if this is what 2k can do at the year 2013, a game where player ai, coach ai and gm ai is non-existent, difficulty levels have so much range inbetween them as in superstar is too easy and hall of fame is ridiculously and **unfairly** hard (at least for me), I **don't** want to see what they can do with 2k14.

Also ridiculous that a company gets no shit because it's 2k, but if this game was made by some company like EA or Activision they would be literally hitler.
