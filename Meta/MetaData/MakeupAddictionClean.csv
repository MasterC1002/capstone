When I got there, I found a young girl, around 9 or 10 years old, smearing lipstick on the floor. I walked over to her and asked where her mom was. She got angry and tried to smear the rest of the lipstick on me. Her mother came around and got angry at me because I WOULDN'T LET HER DAUGHTER PLAY WITH THE MAKEUP. After a bit of arguing, a walmart worker walked down the isle and I told her what the little girl had done and the worker told the crazy bitch mother that she would have to pay for all of the damage done. All together, there was around $100 worth of damage done (the worker also found makeup brushes pulled out of their containers and 3 smashed bottles of nail polish.) The women threatened to SUE ME AND WALMART, because her daughter destroyed property. 

I know this isn't really about a certain product, but stuff like this really makes me angry. Also, if you feel the need to try every single lipstick and then put it back, don't. "	t5_2rww2	True

1374324138.0	1ioxf5	[RANT][RAVE] Stop trying to change my race with your makeup!	wildcreatures	1289	263	373	"I live in Southeast Asia (Philippines). Most natives have lovely, golden brown skin. My culture, however, views white skin as superior skin -- we were colonized by the Spanish and the Americans and colonial mentality still dictates that *mestizas* or ""half-white"" Filipinas are prettier than their darker counterparts. You see this in the media: all top tier local celebrities look like foreigners and the villain or ""ugly girl"" in most local television shows is usually dark-skinned. Whitening lotion and facial wash are very popular. We even have products like *whitening vaginal wash* so that you can be ""beautiful on the inside"" (their words, not mine!!!). So it's very frustrating.

 

This carries over to makeup stores. I'm so *tired* of salesladies and makeup artists pushing white foundation on me. It doesn't match! It makes me look like a ghost! But they insist that the fairer/whiter I look, the better. They also try to get me to buy contour pens for the specific purpose of lining my nose to make it straighter and Caucasian-looking. I only started buying makeup this month and I've had a very hard time convincing makeup reps that I do, indeed, want to look my race. Today, a rep from a Korean brand that shall not be mentioned told me that their BB cream looked great on me but the tester was probably 5 shades lighter than my current skin color (oh, and it was a whitening product too).

 

That said, I hadn't given higher-end (and hopefully better educated) makeup brands a shot yet so I ditched specialty Asian shops and went to a department store. I was really happy today because I tried Clinique and their saleslady was so helpful and agreed that I should appreciate being *morena* (brown). I finally found a shade that highlights my natural color instead of hiding it. Whew!"	t5_2rww2	True

EDIT: Whoa, whoa, whoa ladies, take off the warpaint. 

So this guy is very nice, we didn't click but he didn't mean anything negative by what he said....honestly this post was me showing off my snappy come back. But in response to some of the comments I need to say a few things. 

A: He isn't a significant other, I just met him and thought of it more as a friendly outing, but he made it apparent he thought otherwise during the course of the meal (for clarification I did go some people have been asking). 

B: He was trying to make me feel comfortable(awkwardly). When he asked me to lunch I told him I had just gotten out of bed (I work nights) and he said no make up necessary. 

C:I don't think he gets the whole make up as an enhancer vs make up as a mask debate and its not something I feel the need to discuss. 

D:I didn't think he was being controlling/hateful/judgmental/whatever I really just thought my reply was funny.

I wish I'd remembered to do clashing lip liner and eyeliner pencil beauty marks!  I have failed you all.  I will go hang my clown head in shame.  A moment in GIMP and I got some beauty spots in and I really regret not doing it properly, I think it [pulls the whole look together](http://i.imgur.com/DKrEa57.jpg).

Edit 2:  OH HEY I THINK I DROPPED [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/Ai2Xdyu.jpg)

If you want to replicate this look (why?), I got it going using only the crapplicator sponges and brushes that came with the product, and if it didn't have any, my fingers.  The blush in the later pictures is a dab of lipstick on each cheek smeared around a bit (a tip I read in a teen magazine many years ago - thanks J17!  This wouldn't have been possible without you).  Most of it came out of a cheap palette I bought to mess around with the eyeshadow colours - one of those ones with lip gloss and random shades of face powder, blush and bronzer in the bottom.  Then you pretty much just smoosh it all on like a toddler that's found mum's makeup bag.  It's SO MUCH FUN."	t5_2rww2	True

1374600162.0	1iw947	[MassDrop Voting] Choose the product for our first massdrop to secure a sub-wide discount.	0hn035	883	117	309	"My original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1irra4/misc_why_are_we_not_organizing_as_a_sub_to_get/) if you want to see what I'm talking about. Essentially we have the opportunity to secure discounts by deciding on an item to purchase as a community.  

It seemed we had a decent amount of interest, so I'll go ahead and organize our drops.  Essentially what I'm going to do is list categories.  Under each category, you guys are free to post what product in that category you'd like to purchase at a discount.  **If the item comes in multiple colors or options, please choose one.  For example, OCC Lip Tar must include a specific product for the drop to work.  We cannot drop an entire brand.** Please refrain from posting the same item twice.  

I will take the top upvoted category and choose the top three products from that category to create a massdrop.  I will post the massdrop to the sub, linking to it through a separate post as well as through here.  Then, we need 200 people to vote for the massdrop item, and the massdrop should be on!

I will count only upvotes, not downvotes, in order to dissuade people from downvoting products other than theirs.  I will return to this thread weekly and run through each category, creating new massdrops.  This means that even if we choose mascara as our first massdrop, if blush is second on the list, I will create it the week after.  That way there's no reason to continue creating this thread over and over.  Additionally, that means you can upvote as many items as you'd like to see drop.  Please just remember that if you upvote in this thread, you should vote later at the actual massdrop site so that we can get our drops to go off successfully.  

In this thread, please only post items and upvotes.  If you would like to comment on how Massdrop works or ask questions, ask in the original thread linked above or pm me.  I'd like to keep this thread as clean as possible for ease of use.

**Also, if you would like to see this happen please upvote the thread for visibility.  It's a self-post, I receive no karma.**"	t5_2rww2	True

It doesn't matter what their makeup looks like, even if it's the prettiest makeup I've ever seen, if I look in the comments, there are several pointing out their distaste for the nosering.

This subreddit focuses on makeup. Not body jewelry, enhancement, what have you. Please do not voice your opinion about someone's personal decisions here, unless it has to do with makeup.

I have my septum pierced. Just today someone came up to me and said, ""Get that out of your nose, you're too pretty for that,"" and many find it appropriate to tell me how ugly they find it. *This is not okay.* Especially not here.

So please /r/makeupaddiction, keep this place a safe haven where the only thing I'm judged on is my makeup. I don't want to have to take out my piercing just to get a normal opinion.

1359385024.0	17fi4l	Winter Gift Exchange - please confirm NOT receiving your gift (please upvote for visibility).	Petra-Arkanian	781	89	68	"Okay, ladies (and the occasional gentlemen).  It's been three weeks since the shipping deadline for the Winter Gift Exchange, so I think it is reasonable to begin rematching anyone who has not received a gift.  So here's how it is going to go:

* **Comment here if you have not received a gift** (or PM me if you don't want to publicly post).
* **I will follow up with your swap partner to make sure that they didn't mail anything** (but if they say they did, they had better have a tracking number).  If they can prove they shipped something to you, I will hold off on rematching you right now.
* If I do not hear back from your partner, or they confirm that they're a shafting little worm, **I will rematch you** as best I can according to the budget that you had for the original swap.

If you were shafted, fear not!  You **will** receive a gift - there are plenty of people signed up to be rematchers.  You may end up with a gift that costs a little less than what you spent, but you will not go empty-handed.  With this in mind, **if you are reading this and willing to be a rematcher, please PM me with your budget, country of residence, and whether you are willing to ship internationally.**  

**EDIT:**  I should have been more clear; rematching means **gifting someone who was shafted out of the kindness of your heart, *not* doing a complete swap.**

Additionally, if you signed up for the exchange and shafted your partner, it probably goes without saying that **you are banned** from any future exchanges I organize (the next one will probably be in the summer), and in the meantime I will be thinking of ways to mitigate shafting.

Rematching will be completed by next Monday, February 4th.  Any questions, please let me know.  As always, **please upvote this post for visibility**.  I do not get imaginary internet points for this self-post.

**EDIT:**  Please do not include your swap partner's username if you are posting publicly.  While it's uncool that they didn't send you a gift, I don't want anyone getting out pitchforks.  Just say ""my swap partner"" - I'll be able to look up who it was."	t5_2rww2	True

1361469039.0	18yr8p	I just wanted to thank you guys for helping me get a new job.	Scumbelina_	748	102	60	"As of about three months ago I didn't wear any make up at all, apart from on special occasions. Zilch. Nothing.  I wore glasses to hide my tired eyes and just ignored my blotchy, rosacea laden skin. I was going through a tough time and struggling with depression so I didn't care about anything, let alone my face. 

Then I subscribed to Reddit after about a year of lurking and I could finally subscribe to my preferred subreddits. I sorted out some contact lenses and started to look at the tips and tutorials posted here on MUA. I've put them into practice everyday since. 

My confidence sky rocketed and the compliments rolled in. I work in a department store and it's much nicer catching a glimpse of myself in one of the high def, super well lit mirrors and thinking ""hell yeah!"" instead of ""eurgh, I hate this and that"".

So recently I became unhappy in my current position and, being in a large store, it's easier to look for a new job on one the surrounding concessions. So I heard about a job opening and spoke to the manager about it one day while I was working. She gave me an immediate interview that I hadn't dressed or prepared for. However, I had my everyday make up on and felt like I looked good anyways.  So, not only did this help my confidence but she even told me mid interview that she insists on her staff looking well put together, ""including well applied make up, but I can see you already have that down.""

So thanks guys, it's amazing how a little face paint can be such a positive thing!"	t5_2rww2	True
