1369854424.0	1faann	With the increased exposure due to the Humble Bundle...	checkm-8	136	10	67	"Have any of you players seen an increase player population?  Played against a lot of new players?

As such, lets continue to strive to be a better community than other MOBAs.

* Do your best to give new players tips
* If a new player keeps dying, kindly tell them to stick with you until they learn the ropes
* Due to 'wonderful' matchmaking we get sometimes, if both teams recognize an inexperienced player.  Give the player some slack, both sides help them learn the ropes, how to play their character, ease off the pedal in quickly getting the win or quick newbie kill
* Be helpful outside live games, help mentor/tutor

This is **OUR** chance, **OUR** window of opportunity to make this the best community in welcoming new players to the game.  If we start the usual player bashing/taunting we are going to shy them away.  Who knows, maybe that player you didn't help and called 'dead weight' could've been a great teammate as he was in LoL or DOTA.  Perhaps we could see a formation of a new team which could rival AWFUL from this Humble Bundle.  We won't know any of this if we shut the door on new players.

Awesomenauts isn't looking for a quick buck, they want players who will stay and it's our job as a community to help.  Do we want more skins, characters, maps, perhaps spectator mode?  We need more active players in Awesomenauts and now is the time for us to contribute.

One bad review on Awesomenauts has more weight than a hundred praises (or some misquote like that).

1375141977.0	1jb9zi	Patch 1.21 Voltar LMB -- Suggestion for Ronimo	ninjafetus	103	13	28	"In this patch, left mouse button (LMB) heal works differently.

* Holding LMB charges heal, and releasing LMB performs the charged heal.
* You have to click LMB again to start charging again.
* If you click too early after releasing, it does *not* start the new charge up.

The result is that Voltar either needs to spam click to do constant healing, or try and time his press-release correctly.  (I haven't checked which is more efficient.)  

This behavior is a problem for a few reasons:

* Unintuitive, since it is different than all other characters.
* Frustrating to a player who mistimes the LMB click and realizes later that he isn't charging.
* Requires lots of LMB clicks throughout the game, again unlike other characters.
* Requires held LMB in periods of inactivity (getting ready) instead of only during use.

You could fix this easily, and bring it more in like with the standard behavior.

* While not holding LMB, Voltar charges heal.
* Pressing LMB performs charged heal.  
* Holding LMB performs repeat small heals, just like previous patches.

If you aren't interested in doing that fix, at least make it so an early click-hold on the LMB buffers a charge for the heal.  I.e., if you click and hold early, it starts charging the heal immediately after the heal cooldown has completed.  That would remove the annoyance of missing your timing without making the heal speed any faster."	t5_2tvrv	True

Riven-Bot	64	10	11	"A key part of this game is not being able to see what the enemy team is picking for Awesomenauts, to avoid hard counters. For example, let's say I'm playing a Derpl. Their team is Clunk, Lonestar, and Voltar. After seeing that I am playing Derpl, Lonestar and Voltar disconnect and come back as Raelynn and Coco, good counters against Derpl. This has happened a couple times to me, and I thought of a simple fix. When you disconnect from a match, if you reconnect to that particular game your character and item upgrades are locked in.

1371645770.0	1gngtr	How to deal with Ayla	Mindcide	59	9	34	"Edit:  I hate the title, it was a place holder I forgot to change.  This isn't a ""How do I deal with Ayla?!?"" post, but meant to be a detailed answer and discussion to said question.  

Foreword:  I have a day off work and I'm bored.  Therefore, I want to start a real discussion for those having trouble with Ayla since I've certainly been there.  I'm providing advice from my experience and invite anyone else to contribute too.  There'll be a quick rundown for each hero as well as generic tactics.  I'll provide conclusions where appropriate.  

I've been seeing a lot of frustration from people when playing against Ayla, stuggling to compete with her using old play styles and getting shut down as a result.  She seems obnoxious, anti-fun and seems too easy when you're on the receiving end of a beatdown.  There are cries everywhere, demanding nerfs and seeking advice.  I was the same on day 1 of her release, she destroyed me in every game I played and I couldn't figure out what was going wrong.  Since I couldn't figure it out, I got frustrated.  

Since then, I've experimented with different heroes and loadouts as well as techniques and tactics when facing off with her.  As a result, I haven't had a game where I mindlessly fed 5+ kills to their Ayla and have had much more competitive games.  I want to share tips with the community, as it's small enough already and no one should feel like quitting due to a new hero giving them grief.  

Firstly, the best tip I can offer which applies to everyone is simply do not try any solo plays.  Just don't.  If you're alone in a lane, stay in your half, near to a turret.  This is especially important if you're playing a slower hero without an escape mechanism.  Vertical movement is useful too, alternate between jump pads and exploiting the speed of falling to widen the gap.  Use a buddy system, when in a pair you become exponentially more safe, just try not to stand exactly on top of each other when in combat with Ayla.  Teamwork is paramount to fighting her, so always work with your teammates.  

The other major weapon in combating Ayla is crowd control.  Every kind of crowd control is a great help against her, each with their own advantages.  You should greatly consider switching items to those with silences, blinds, snares and such as standard, due to the popularity of Ayla and the effectiveness it brings to defeating her.  These two seemingly obvious tips are generic to any hero, but there are more character specific measures that can be taken too (note I don't use item names, I imagine newer players still haven't learned all the names, so I'll be using descriptions):

**TLDR so far**:  Don't duel her; stay as a group.  Crowd control and mobility improvement is king.  Knockbacks are the ultimate answer.  

**Froggy G**- Froggy has a relatively easy time staying alive vs Ayla but a tougher time actually fighting back.  His dash gives him superior mobility in times of strife, which can be so prominent that most Ayla's probably wont even try to all in a Froggy when he has his dash available.  Use your stun when in a group to knock her out the sky and burst her down.  Consider taking shield on whirlwind over reflect damage to absorb a significant chunk of rage damage (six ticks of maxed damage rage).  

&gt; TLDR Frog:  Shield on whirlwind, +stun time, save dash for escape or team initiate.  

**Lonestar** - All the rage and whine on all the forums concerning Ayla doesn't compare to the rage an Ayla player feels when she messes with the bull.  It knocks her further back than everyone else due to her lesser friction mechanic while in rage-mode and can consistently save yourself and teammates alike.  Blindamite is also worth considering, as a backup for a much easier escape should the bull somehow fail.  

&gt; TLDR Cowboy:  Be bullshit bull bully.  Blind on dynamite.  Shove hard when you force her away.  

**Leon** - Leon has a real rough time duelling Ayla.  Avoiding her as much as possible for the early game is advisable, preferring to gank the other two where you can or surprising her with a pull in when moving as a team.  Your best asset is silence on tongue grab, which enables a couple seconds of free damage when she's not raging.  Don't fight her on top of your clones, as they provide her with free healing.  

&gt; TLDR Lizard:  1v1 = no.  Silence tongue.  Work with team or avoid Ayla.    

**Clunk** - The easiest and most stress-free method of dealing with Ayla is simply playing Clunk.  This guy is such a hilarious hard-counter to Ayla that I feel like I'm insulting your intelligence by explaining it.  One rank in snare bite and buffing up explode then auto attack will force Ayla to never come near you, and if your teammates stick with you then she's got to be cautious of everybody.  

&gt; TLDR Robot:  Crazy hard counter.  Get your crunk on, right click -&gt; E -&gt; get money.  

**Voltar** - Voltar has received a lot of flak for being close to useless recently, but he's really strong against Ayla.  Knockback on your heal and/or healbot is *mandatory* and once attained, she becomes a much less significant threat.  Voltar also pairs up nicely with an Ayla teammate, as there'll always be a target that needs healing.  Consider blind on drones for added safety, as Ayla a *lot* faster than you.  

&gt; TLDR Brain:  Knockbacks are essential.  Pair up.  Blind drones.  Don't overextend.  

**Gnaw** - Gnaw can have a bad time if you have an aggressive play style.  Gnaw is my main, so I've had to massively alter how I play him to actually win games against Ayla.  Firstly, weedling nests cannot exist anymore.  In fact, two weedlings mustn't be placed within an Ayla-rage-diametre of each other, or she'll gain more health than losing when she's clearing them.  I find the best way is to get improved weedling health and then focus on damage over time on spit and bite and using a hit-and-run defensive style.  Try out slow on spit as you essentially have nothing else to widen the gap if she's chasing you, but the best method is never step out too far in the first place.  

&gt; TLDR Bug: Spread out weedlings, use hit 'n' run DoTs, play very safe.  

**Coco** - Probably the most fun hero to play when confronting an Ayla.  Coco's kit allows her to torment a chasing Ayla with slows and knock backs and I'm sure any Coco mains are not the ones on the forums doing the whining.  Put blaze onto your ball, get increased attack range and more potent slows.  You can also create areas for your team mates to safely traverse with blaze when being pursued and save them like Lonestar with a swift knockback.  

&gt; TLDR Surfer:  You are allowed to duel Ayla.  Increased slows recommended.  

**Skolldir** - I find Skolldir's effectiveness can swing either way.  His potential is immense, as a fling at the right time can condemn Ayla if thrown into a turret or condemn your team if tossed into your fleeing allies.  Earthquake is almost impossible to land on her so specialising in stun and throw is standard.  Landing consistent stuns will mess up Ayla's kill potential, but landing multiple combos can be tricky against a good player.  Your stun can scare the Ayla too, providing you some presence to protect smaller team mates.  

&gt; TLDR Fatman:  Be mindful of flings.  Get stun.  Protect allies.  

**Yuri** - Yuri has an abysmal early game against Ayla.  She's faster, turns sharper and her aura seems to be about twice as big as yours, regardless of the animation.  If you're more than 5 seconds from your turret, you're probably already dead.  You need certain items on time warp to move further out of the safe zone, specifically +slow and +size and boots will be enough to actually escape Ayla, temporarily.  Since it's not in Yuri's nature to spend a lot of time with your land faring allies, try to just be where Ayla isn't and shove the lanes.  

&gt; TLDR Monkey:  Slow&amp;size on time warp.  Pre-emptive avoidance or death until then.  

**Raelynn** - Raelynn is capable of holding her own, since her default playstyle specialises in maintaining a distance from her foe anyway.  Her boots upgrade is enough to outrun Ayla, although it requires no aggression for a few seconds to kick in.  Timerift is a brilliant backup anyway and getting +slow and +damage on it really hurts Ayla, as well as giving the perfect opportunity for a snipe.  After this combo, if she doesn't run then she probably wont have the hp to bring you down.  Blind on your snipe is also an option, if you're goal is getting her to rage-quit.  

&gt; TLDR Sniper: Keep your distance, combo abilities to hold her at bay.  Easy matchup with a cautious play style.  

**Derpl** - I don't really play this guy, but his snare trap is a foolproof escape mechanism.  Getting increased trap and snare duration are a good idea.  I can't comment much on the intricacies of his play as I don't know what they are at the best of times.  
*Paraphrased from* /u/Dwel111 - Liberal usage of nukes is recommended as well as investing in damage reduction for turret mode.  Ayla will have trouble trading since she must be on top of you, dealing less than ideal damage and allowing a melee nuke to put the fight in Derpl's favour.  

&gt; TLDR Slug:  Snare traps.  Snare traps everywhere.  Turret up with +shield and win trades using melee nukes.  

**Vinnie** - Similar to Derpl, I just don't play this one either.  I've played against him enough to realise that his blinding cloud is going to be a bitch for Ayla to deal with, especially when it is upgraded to silence too.  The burst damage on upgraded spikes matches that of a low hp Ayla nuke, so juke using cloud until she's low enough to execute, but be *extremely* careful of her doing the same to you.  Don't try to fight her alone, use skills to escape if you're caught out.  

&gt; TLDR Fish:  Aid team with jukes using cloud, avoid duels and only engage when with full team.  

**Genji** - Cocoon is the shit.  This is the only ability that I'm aware of that can turn off rage mode, which (in my opinion) makes Genji the hardest of hard counters.  What this guy lacks in damage he makes up for with incredible utility.  Get improved damage reduction and perhaps a heal for your shield and laugh as Ayla wastes her time trying to tickle down you and your friends.  Don't venture too far out alone and get as much practice landing cocoon as possible, as getting caught out and missing your skill shot spells certain doom.  

&gt; TLDR Worm:  Both abilities hard counter Ayla.  Play the role of support and feed Ayla to your teammates.  

**Ayla** - Ayla vs Ayla, oh how absurd it is to witness this fight.  You will see Aylas flying around at the top of a map, as if to juke each other?  Even though their circles are of exact diameter and damage, they'll try to dodge each other while simultaneously damaging the foe.  Insanity.  Anyway, this matchup is all about timing your evil eye nuke ability, knowing the numbers and when to strike.  If you do it first and don't get the kill, chances are his will now hit harder and it's over.  Ayla players will already have some intuition for when to do this, so my advice would be redundant.  

&gt; TLDR New Girl:  What happens when an unstoppable force meets another fucking unstoppable force?  

.

Other useful elements to your meta game are maintaining a degree of map control.  Tower hugging in both lanes isn't ideal in any team composition, so having a Gnaw or Yuri on your team to make areas safe to traverse is handy.  I have said so already but I really want to stress this point - your team will be infinitely better off with a form of displacement (Knockback or pull toward) for teamfights against Ayla.  To separate and burst her down is the most successful lategame method I can think of, and displacement makes it so much easier to execute.  

Hopefully there's something amongst this wall of words that helps you out when head butting a wall to soothe the pain of dealing with Ayla.  The community is small enough as is without an exodus of players leaving due to frustration, so I felt compelled to write something up and attempt to help out.  

If there are any strategies you have found out yourself to help combat this new and exciting hero, please share them here.  Any Ayla mains are also free to chime in with tips for playing with or against her.  Thanks for reading and best of luck in your struggles against Ayla!

**TL;DR Everything** - Ayla tough shit yo, but not immortal.  Crowd Control &gt; Damage.  Teamwork is mandatory.  If you have no escape mechanism, don't stray far from tower.  Don't stand on top of allies or droids or weedlings.  When all else fails, be Clunk.

I've given it some thought.  If you want to back out after reading the following, it's totally fine with me.  Simply PM or reply within this thread.

1) **I'm getting rid of the experienced player upgrade limitation rule.  Whoever is your experienced player (20+hrs) is allowed whatever build order they wish.**
I'm a one Naut show setting up this tourney and I can imagine the headache I'm going to get next week scrutinizing everyone's screenshot after every match to see if they upgraded 'correctly.'  The original purpose of the upgrade handicap rule was to make the veteran players less intimidating...however the community response to this event has been nothing short of awesome.  I'm getting veterans willing to step up to mentor new players as well as fill in a team spot they desperately need.  

2) I will be putting a hard cap on the amount of players that may compete in the tourney.  I want to make sure there is an equal amount of teams in the brackets I form.  The best way to go about it?  I'll form as many teams as possible during the weekend from the spreadsheet I have, see how many we need to be 'even,' and then cap it at a certain amount of players going forward.  I'll do my best so that teams don't have a bye.  If a bye is forced, the team with the less experience from my spreadsheet in terms of hours/level will get the bye.

3) You are allowed one substitute player on your team to improve your schedule options.  One thing I learned from the APL is that there will ALWAYS be a reason for a sub.  Please note having one experienced player on your team still applies and I'll have to spot check them as I do with all player competing.


**TD;LR - You still can have only one experienced player, but he/she is not upgrade restricted, there will be a hard cap on the amount of players that may participate, and you are allowed one sub player in case someone on your team is unable to play a match for any reason.**


Here's a [rough spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvI4Rzu6kQKWdGh1eTMtcW5fRzY0STRKYmlpSDBGNHc&amp;usp=sharing) of where I'll be placing the information as well as tournament bracket.

Lets see how much buzz we can get for this.  Whether it takes off or not will determine if we have the tourney.  If we can even form four teams I will be a happy Naut.

What I need from you is to post under this thread the following:

* Steam Name
* Hours played
* Current Level
* Are you looking for teammates?  If you already have a team, what is your team name?  Are you team captain (I'll be using this person for direct communication for the matches/questions)

Right now first prize for the team that wins is three copies of **Swords and Soldiers** which unlocks the [Voltar Necro Skin](http://www.awesomenauts.com/Necrovoltar/index.html)

**Rules:**

* Maximum hours logged into the game will be 20 (exceptions below)
* Best of 3, Best of 5 semifinals, Best of 7 finals
* No switching characters mid game
* No build-changing exploits allowed (disconnect from game, join game with a different build order)
* Any build is fine, no restrictions
* Maps are random for first game then losing team picks map
* Results of each match are to be screenshot (F12 when playing the game) by the team captain and sent to me via Steam link.  If you need help, no worry I'll walk you through how to do it.

**Sign ups end Sunday, June 9th**

*The matches will occur over the course of several days starting on **Monday, June 10th**.  Anytime is fine, just as long as you finish all your matches and send the results to me.  All matches should be completed by Friday, June 14.  Semifinals and finals will be played out on June 14-15th.*

The reasoning behind a week long tourney is to accommodate those from different time zones, real life things that come up, etc.  I mean, this game is awesome, but it's okay if things suddenly happen where you have to postpone for a day or two.

Each team captain has the responsibility of contacting the opposing team to coordinate their matches.  If you are unable to reach out to them and are missing in action to play, let me know as they will be subject to disqualification if matches are not completed by Friday June 14.

I'll do my best to find teammates for those looking but check out the 'Community Resources' on the right column of this Reddit for help.

I understand the 20hrs maximum and levels will change as you practice with your teammates.  As such, I'll personally audit each of your hours as I log your information into the spreadsheet.  After it's entered, you are officially good to go and play to your heart's delight.

For those who become the 'odd naut' out and can't find players.  Experienced players (+20hrs) will be able to step up and be added to your team.

* Only one experienced player is allowed in each team.  Which means you MUST find another beginner/novice level player for your team to qualify.

Have fun!  **AND SPREAD THE WORD**

As you play the game, ask if they have purchased the Humble Bundle, how many hours they logged in, etc.  Have an awesome friend in real life, but they don't have the game?  Gift it!

**It looks like I'm going to have to friend you on Steam for me to check your hours if your account is set to 'Private.'  If you are still interested, please continue post here and I will PM you with further details.  Furthermore, I've created a [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/HumbleBundleNauts) so those added in the tourney can also communicate there if you wish.**"	t5_2tvrv	True

With all the new members, there have been a lot of posts with people asking questions or asking for help. A lot of these posts are hovering around 0 due to numerous downvotes. Please be considerate of the new members and don't downvote posts in which people are looking to have questions answered. I know that the Awesomenauts community has prided itself on staying away from the levels of vitriol and hate experienced in other MOBAs, so let's continue that same attitude and show the new members some respect.

Remember, downvotes are for posts that are off topic, offensive, or add nothing to the discussion about Awesomenauts. You can help these new members out by upvoting their posts that you think will contain useful information for other new members.

Also, if you are new here try searching the subreddit before posting to see if your topic has been brought up before and use the sidebar for any information about tips and guide.

- Hacks
- Cheats
- Drama

- Memes
- **Witch Hunts***

*If you have come across a hacker in-game, you should not take a screen shot and post it here. Instead, please [report hackers directly to Ronimo](http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3480). Please don't take it upon yourself to start a witch hunt against their Steam account.

1366140148.0	1chaem	Voltar issues are getting ridiculous.	SerphTheDerpl	44	6	31	"Even pre-1.17, Genji's healing was concerning for Voltar. 42 healing on as low as a 10 second CD paired up with Genji's ability to combine healing and attack speed on auto-attack made for a lot of healing while still having good damage dealing, damage reducing and CC potential.


But no. Even besides Genji's *cost reduction* in regards to attack speed  upgrade, the biggest issue facing Voltar is the **NEW MAP, AIGUILLON.**

Let me explain. Aiguillon's main feature is the stealth orb. This stealth orb is a great boon to characters like Clunk or Derpl, and still pretty great for say, Froggy or Genji. The character receiving the least use of it (besides a bug, see below) is Voltar. Voltar, even ignoring the drones issue, has no real use for invisibility. It breaks on healing, which he does even out of combat, and he gains very little tactical advantage from its positioning benefits.

Besides this, at the moment Voltar's suicide drones do not go invisible with him. This means his location is very, very obvious to the enemy team. I'm going to go ahead and say this is a bug, based on the fact that they still shoot while invisible, potentially killing even turrets. The fact this bug made it through beta, though, is a bit worrying.

As an additional note, maneuvering the map as Voltar is very, very difficult (in my experience). As many may have noticed, Voltar can often get 'stuck'(sometimes unable to jump on platforms going down) on moving platforms, which are in no short supply in Aiguillon. Though the issue isn't Voltar-exclusive, it's also worthy of note that his jump's height often leaves him just shy of ledges on the map, making him wait a long while on elevators.

It's awfully stressful how Voltar feels the least compatible of any Naut with the new map, and how his support power in regards to Genji is continuing to wane.

Anyone else feel similarly?

I'm just coming up with things off of the top of my head right now and don't have a lot of time. PLEASE comment with content and any questions that you might have pertaining to the game or otherwise. Thanks!)

Hello fellow Redditnauts! I've noticed that recently there has been a large influx of people joining this sub, which is great! A lot of these people often come bearing questions, so this post is to help clarify some of the more commonly asked questions that I see around here.

*  ***""I'm new to this game and don't really get how it works, help?""***

&gt;Awesomenauts is a MOBA game. I see a lot on here people coming from different kinds of MOBA games (LoL, DOTA2) and try to compare it to those games. While this game does share some similarities to other MOBA games, it's quite unique in it's take on it. The primary goal is to destroy the enemy turrets so that you can ultimately destroy their drill, or base. To do this, you and your teammates have to guide droids (bots, creeps) to these turrets to act as a meat shield of sorts so your team can dish some damage out to the turret without getting hurt yourself. At the same time you want to kill enemy droids as well as enemies and collect solar (the shiny cubes that they drop). Then you must use this solar to buy upgrades and abilities for your character (these are predefined before the game starts). Try not to die while trying to kill everything that you can, and you'll be great.

* ***""I'm not sure which Naut I should play./Which Naut is best/worst?""***

&gt;This question is purely subjective. In this game, unlike other MOBAs, the Nauts are, for the most part, pretty balanced. Every Naut (character) is different and has a different play style. When you start the game you will only have a limited selection of characters. Try playing a few practice rounds and reading some guides online. Below is a rough description of the roles of each character.

* ***""How do I beat a turtle Derpl that just hides behind a turret/base?""*** 

&gt;[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/15vk5w/how_do_u_beat_this_derpl_just_sitting_at_his_base/) offers some solid advice on how to deal with turtles in general. 

* ***""Where are my stats for my Naut? Speed, health, damage?""***

&gt;When you are selecting your item loadout, if you hover on your Naut's autoattack, it will show you the base stats of your Naut. It does the same for your attacks as well. 

* ***""What build is best for _____?""***

&gt;The [wiki](http://awesomenauts.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Awesomenauts) has some builds on there for you to try out. As with any moba game, the best builds are those that you figure out on your own. Here's some tips on making good builds.
&gt;Focus on the role and game style that you want your individual character to use. This is the most important tip as it will allow you to have a uniformity in your gameplay. For example, Let's say you wanted to play an aggressive Bull Lonestar. Some questions you might ask yourself is: How much solar do I need to make this build work? What should my regular build order be? What other abilities synchronize well with my bull?
&gt;Think of the possible builds your opponents are using. Try thinking of how it might counter your build or what you might need to build in order to counter theirs.
&gt;Try to be flexible. Sometimes you might find your build is rather useless. In order to make your build not so useless against certain nauts try adding upgrades that you would normally not use except end game or certain situations.

* ***""Should I get Piggy Bank or Solar Tree?""***

&gt;[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wAaYLL6IPs) does a wonderful job of explaining the pros and cons of each. A summary is Piggy bank if you want the early advantage. Solar Tree if you are playing for late game.

* ***""How do I get better?""***
&gt;Play the game even when you are losing. If you are getting frustrated from joining games in progress then try playing some practice rounds to hone your skill. Remember, this is just a game so have fun! And whatever you do, DO NOT take it out on your teammates. Not everyone can be the best at this game. Some people are just trying to play the game and have a good time. Being a jerk to someone who isn't good instead of being helpful is just bad for the community. Remember, we were all noobs once!

* ***""What's that duck by your name?""***

&gt;It stands for community helper.

* ***I think that someone might be hacking or abusing the system. What do I do?***

&gt;Is he really hacking, or is he just really good? Hacking usually looks like a character using his powers with absolutely no cool down (tons of Yuri mines, continuous Clunk missiles, endless Leon clones, etc.). If you see this going on, take screenshots (F12 key by default on Steam) and send a copy of your log file* and the screenshots to cheating@ronimo-games.com. Please report these guys. They take the fun out of everything.
&gt;
&gt;* Log File = VERY IMPORTANT. Find it at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam\steamapps\common\awesomenauts on PC, \Users\ [your username] \Library\Application Support\Steam\SteamApps\common\Awesomenauts on Mac.

* ***""What is Solar and how do I use it?""***

&gt;Solar is the in game currency used to buy new upgrades for your naut when you go back to base. It can be gained in many ways and is necessary to level up and to be able to stay competitive against the enemy team. Solar also comes in two forms, silver and gold coins. The silver coins are worth 1 solar each and the gold are worth 5.
&gt;
&gt;Solar can be obtained by:
&gt;
&gt;Every 2 seconds of gameplay you are given 1 solar
&gt;
&gt;Picking it up around the field - worth 1 or 5 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing or looting droids or gnaws weedling - worth 5 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing neutral creeps - worth 3 solar
&gt;
&gt;Killing or looting super droids - worth 25 solar 
&gt;
&gt;Destroying a turret - 50 to killer/dropped if killed by bots + 30 for team
&gt;
&gt;Killing enemy Naut - 60 to killer/dropped if killed by bots + 30 for team
&gt;
&gt;Killing a Solar Boss - worth 30 solar
&gt;
&gt;Picking it up during the drop at the beginning of the game or after death or by having purchased an upgrade to increase solar.
&gt;
&gt;*Note: Dying will count as a loss of 30 solar, so be careful and die as little as possible


* ***""How do the in game levels work?""***

&gt;At the beginning of every game, your naut will begin at level 1. Gaining 100 after the game has started will level your naut up by 1. Your level will remain what it was at even if you spend the solar, and you will continue to go up by 1 level for each 100 additional solar gained.
&gt;
&gt;*Note: You begin the with 200 solar, but only at level 1. It is after this initial 200 that you gain a level. Also, the level of a naut does not show a necessarily directly correlate to a player being stronger or better, but rather having more money, having a better farm, different upgrades/build.

* ***""Is there a way I can see what upgrades the other/my own team has?""***

&gt;Yes, there is. Simply hold tab to bring up the scoreboard and use your mouse or the arrow keys to select the name of the person who's build you would like to see. Their upgrades will be displayed in order of purchase right between the two teams scores in the middle of the screen, right next to the time played. Note that you will not see the names of the upgrades, but rather just the picture of each, so you will have to be familiar with what they are to understand it.
&gt;
&gt;*Note: It will not display whether or not it is a multi-tier upgrade or how many tiers they have bought, but rather just that they have bought at least the first tier.

Any suggestions for future 'myths' to try out would be appreciated, or feedback on the video itself. I'll try and tackle some of the most common requests first. I am planning on posting a new episode about each week but depending on the response and myths submitted it could be more often or less regular.

The goal of this is for anyone to ask any thing related to Awesomenauts and hopefully the community can help answer. This is a great place to ask that question that has been annoying you, but you think it does not warrant its own thread. I am in no way an Awesomenauts guru so I most likely wont be able to answer most questions so I hope that everyone gets involved and tries to help out others.

Please do not be condescending in responses to sincere questions. Even if it is the most obvious or silly questions, those questions are the reason for this thread. Thanks

Last month, [I posted some of the traffic stats to show how much the subreddit was growing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/1450kg/thanks_for_a_great_november_redditnauts/) and this month the numbers are even more surprising.

In November we had 7,800 unique hits to the site, but in December that number was blown out of the water. For the month of December, /r/Awesomenauts saw 17,500 unique visitors: an increase of almost 10,000.

In November /r/Awesomenauts had 33,686 pageviews, which was the second highest monthly pageviews since the site was created. In December, on the other hand, we had 70,725! That is an insane increase in just one month.

December was also stellar in terms of new Redditnauts as well. We not only broke the 1,000 subscriber barrier but also gained 453 new Redditnauts! That is well over the 200 we gained last month.

And things are looking to be even better this month as well. In just over a week, we've had over 7,000 unique hits, 33,000 pageviews, and over 200 subscribers. We are growing faster than ever. Thanks, guys, for making this community Awesome."	t5_2tvrv	True

First post soiled woop

A year or so ago I remember hearing about Awesomenauts and thinking ""ugh another crazy complicated MOBA I'll never be good at or have fun with."" It was one of TotalBiscuits' WTF is... videos and my interest was piqued but not enough to care so I just putz around not thinking of it for quiet a bit. Then, a year later I saw more content on it and decided to look it up on steam. $2.50 for a $10... Hell yea I'll buy it, just bought tacos and spent more. After a quick download I was blown away by how funny, enjoyable, challenging, and frankly the loud ass intro monkey... A few weeks later my friend Kirean bought it after seeing me playing it on his steam friends list. From here the snowball begins.

Soon after all of my friends in mumble heard us laughing, yelling, and just going nuts at the action on our screens. Still being on sale some of them bought it, then more, then the ones that couldn't I bought a copy or two for, then my friends bought a copy or two to gift away. From this I went from being the only one having it over 16 of my friends owning the game. With close to 170+ hours and over $35 spent on this game(extra copies, humble bundles, and skin packs) I feel I still under paid. I have my strong opinions about the games balance and ""pro league"" potential but who doesn't have a thought or two about balance. That aside I have played this game for close to 8+ months and have never had more fun in any multiplayer game yet. I wanted to use my first post to say thanks to Ronimo for being total bosses when it came to the attitude towards this game, its pricing policies, its DLC, updates, and for all the side splitting tear inducing laughs I've had thanks to this off the wall game. Truly GGWP sirs and/or madams. I will continue playing, recording, and over all just enjoying this great game."	t5_2tvrv	True

I really like the art style, the controls, and pretty much everything about the game, but I'm just totally outclassed, and I don't even seem to be improving with practice.  

I can beat the easy bots in practice mode, but that has grown boring.  Playing against humans was fun at first despite the constant losing, but between the disheartening things my teammates say to me and my lack of improvement I've reached the end of my rope today.  

Sorry if you guys get a lot of these threads; maybe posting this is in poor taste, and if so I apologize.  I mostly just want to praise the game, and congratulate you all on being able to enjoy it.  Clearly it takes a deceptive amount of skill to play this, and I'm sure it feels good to be effective and to win.

Two Stupid Dogs was one of my favorite shows as a wee little kid, and it's nice to see such references being made in such an awesome game. I think the reason I love Awesomenauts so much is that it's humor is directly in line with the humor I had grown up with.

### DO:

---

* **Report the suspected cheater directly to Ronimo.**

The instructions on how to do so are available [in this topic](http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3480) on their forums.

* **Leave the game.**

A cheater is playing online to win against humans, not bots.  Being left to play by their lonesome is how you can rob them of the satisfaction they seek.

### DO NOT:

---

* **Publicly accuse the suspected cheater in-game.**

If you're incorrect in your suspicions and make a bad call, you're not only making yourself look like a bad sport, but you're also hurting the overall community too. Turn the tables around and look at it another way: wouldn't you be upset with the other players, with the game's community if you were playing honestly but still being accused of cheating on a regular basis?  

Just report them to Ronimo, leave that match, and move on.

* **Publicly accuse the suspected cheater out of the game.**

As above.  Remember, it's not always a cheat that you're seeing happen. Sometimes it's a bug, sometimes it's lag, sometimes it's just the way the game is intentionally designed.  You may not know the whole story; let Ronimo sort it out instead by reporting the suspected cheater to them.

* **Give the suspected cheater attention.**

Again, like the above two, you don't want to really acknowledge the player if you think they're cheating. By leaving, you'll rob them of the attention they're *desperately* seeking; by posting up something on the Ronimo forums or on this subreddit afterwards, you're just *giving them that attention anyways.*  The reason they're cheating is to get the attention of others. 

***Don't give them it.***

Coco: 8 (3.2%)
Gnaw: 3 (1.2%)
Voltar: 2 (0.8%)

Now what does this all mean. Well not a lot.  Unsurprising to most Lonestar and Froggy G are both really high in number of favorites while Voltar and Gnaw are both very low.  The rest are fairly moderate in number (accounting for the outliers).

Now the reason for all of this isn't exact.  You can make cases for class balance or broken-ness (underpowered and overpowered) but it's also important to look at naut synergy and of course personal preference (for example not liking their voice, their taunts, appearance concept etc.)

So what does this all mean?  Not a whole lot.  Most of it isn't surprising (Froggy and Lonestar are high in numbers, but this isn't the first season where this is the case).

So basically I was bored counted stuff and now I'm sharing.

Enjoy."	t5_2tvrv	True

1. Good players may not always be good together.

2. Being mindful of the in-game command feature. Pounding the ""Defend"" button 3 dozen times isn't being constructive. 

3. Use the chat to be constructive, and plan strategy. Theres nothing worse than a player who is silent all match and then quips something like ""my team is the worst ever! blah blah blah blah"" after the match. It doesn't do anything good, and doesn't help anyone.

4. Remember, if your experience is anything like mine, you're probably playing with the same 100 people or so. There's no point in being rude or unsportsmanlike, you'll probably be on the same team again tomorrow.

Instead of just doing that though I thought I'd get respawn times of just about everything on each map (I'm sure some are covered in the wiki but many things get out of date on the wiki from time to time).  This may be useless. Nothing too deep here just times.

**Ribbit IV**:

 * All Health: 2 minutes
 * Small Beasts: 20 seconds
 * Solar Boss: 2 minutes
 * Creeps: 20 seconds (2 spawn going bottom, 5 seconds later 2 spawn going top then 15 seconds before it begins again)
 * Solar: 12 seconds


**AI Station 404**:

 * Health: 2 minutes
 * Flying Neutral Creeps: 30 seconds
 * Creeps: 25 seconds (2 spawn, 10 seconds later 2 more spawn, then 15 seconds for restart)
 * Flying Creeps (Mosquitos): Very odd, there is some measuring error but it seems there is either a long pattern or random number generation something to effect of 1 adds every 12-18 seconds (if it is full it is simply missed), it does for 5-7 times then it goes on a about 30 second delay before beginning again.  (Again there could be measuring error). Also if it gets to 3 it will skip the next ""spawn"" if its within a certain time frame of the release.
 * Solar: 12 seconds


**Sorona**:

 * Health: 2 minutes
 * Little Worms: 20 seconds
 * Creeps: 20 seconds (4 of em)
 * Solar (Gold and Silver): 12 seconds

Yesterday I posted some simple tidbits of info about the game and gameplay [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/15gpl5/i_dont_know_how_to_get_better/c7mez9u). A while back, people were actually surprised to learn you could prematurely detonate Raelynn's Snipe by clicking the button again. These simple, common questions that are really easy to answer, and hardly require a seperate thread. So I figured, let's make a thread where **everyone can ask questions about the game.**

Turns out, there's a lot of questions surrounding the game. Post them here, and I will try to answer them. I am 100% sure that WawaSC, Simbl and other prominent Redditnauts can, and hopefully will, answer some. If any other redditnauts know the answer to questions, **I highly encourage you all to answer any and all questions you can, and chime in where necesarry.** Just be sure your answer is correct.

I do ask one thing of you: if you post a question, make it one with a possible answer. Not some vague question asking either everything or nothing at all. I assume and hope this goes without saying, but just to be sure, I want it out there.

Examples of bad questions:

* *What is the best awesomenauts build and why?* Bad because there is none, people have different skills and so do nauts. Personal preference and a high degree of subjectivity make it a bad question.

* *When will Ronimo fix the D/C-issue?* Bad because we don't know. Use your brain here, people; ""*There's no such thing as real psychics.*"" - Patrick Jane.

Examples of good questions:

* *How much health does the Drill have?*  Good because it's something you kinda want to know, and it's something people can give a conclusive answer to: 1200 HP.

* *What are some good Youtube channels for Awesomenauts?*  Good because, even though ""good"" is subjective, searching can lead to mainstream/obvious/well-known channels. Having someone point out an underappreciated channel/stream or what have you is an amazing way to find new ones.

* *Will I do more damage with Attack Speed or Attack Damage on champion X?* Good question, because someone can test or calculate it. Hell, maybe people allready did, and haven't shared it, because noone asked!

Congratulations, Redditnauts! We've made it!

Our little community has finally reached our first 1,000 subscribers. What started as a very small community has grown more than I ever thought it would. Thank you all for making this subreddit Awesome.

In honor of this milestone, I have changed the look up a bit (as you may have noticed). I'm new to moderating and this is my first attempt at any major changes so feedback and suggestions are more than welcome.

To make this occasion ever more special, I will be doing a giveaway! Seven lucky Redditnauts will win! I will be giving out a Steam copy of Awesomenauts (give to a friend if you already have it!), the Costume Party DLC, and five copies of the Awesomenauts soundtrack.

To participate, all you need to do is post your Steam name in the comments, along with what your name would be if you were an Awesomenaut, a short description, and what your two abilities would be. The winner of the copy of Awesomenauts and the five recipients of the soundtrack will all be chosen randomly. The winner of the Costumer Party DLC will be chosen by me. I will choose the most creative/funny/interesting Redditnaut as the winner, so get your thinking caps on!

The winner will be decided and announced a week from today on December 20th, so get your submissions in now!

(Note: This is not a suggestion list. Don't post a detailed description and stats of a 'Naut you would like to see in the game. Just a brief description of what you would be if you were in the game. See my example comment posted below).

1366919480.0	1d3r5y	Awesome Etiquette -Do's and Don'ts in Awesomenauts	food_bag	36	11	59	"Post your rules of manners and codes of conduct.

DO

1. If you see a teammate being attacked and running, and you've got health, put yourself in the middle so they can escape.

2. Offer constructive criticism in team chat. ""Volt, buy healing and stick with me, I'll take their turret.""

3. If a teammate calls for help, go to them and help them.

DON'T

1. Mock your team in ALL chat. ""My team sucks. I always get the feeders"" (from a level 7 with a 1/5 score).

2. Steal a Solar boss kill from a teammate (fair game from an opponent, and encouraged if they are low on health from the fight I say).

3. Drop straight onto the Smoocher button before checking the map to see where your teammates are first.

4. Spam taunt or spam chat. (Or spam team commands, like ATTACK!, because some people actually do this).

5. Boss your team around when you suck as a player. ATTACK! DEFEND! ATTACK! DEFEND!

6. Use crude or lewd language. This is Awesomenauts, not Call of Duty.

7. If you are gnaw, don't leave weedlings to kill the health bots. Believe it or not, your own team might like some of that health. Do you really need constant health? Let your weedlings kill the enemy health bots instead, and only the enemy ones.

8. Don't kill your team's health bots when you are on full health because you think it's fun. If you don't need the health, don't take it. Do that shit to the enemy, not your team.

9. Abandon your teammates in the middle of a fair fight.

I'll stop there because this is getting long. Post yours."	t5_2tvrv	True

We noticed a weird patten where the blue bots (the ones that spawn automatically every so often) would push harder than the red ones. If we left them completely alone, they actually went on to destroy all 3 red towers and the red base. We also noticed that the spawns for each team were not in sync... At the point where we were around level 110, the spawn times were 3-4 seconds different.

We started a new match with new heroes, and the same thing happened again. The blue bots pushed past the red bots and destroyed the red turrets.

I bought the game in the winter sale and I have 75 hours of playtime. Friend 1 is rather new to the game with 18 hours of playtime and friend 2 have gotten about 70 hours. I play every other day while #1 plays only once or twice a week and number 2 plays every day more or less. I and #2 are both in leauge 3 and #1 is in league 6. When we get together we like to just play casually and just have fun. However because me and #2 is in league 3 we 8/10 times get placed in a game with harcore players from league 1 that has prestieged about 10 times. (often premades, but hey its league 1 what did you expect?) Because #1 is so inexperienced compared to us it get very difficult for him to keep up. And me and #2 sometimes just want to play something else than our regular nauts. It gets really boring after 4 lost matches in a row to these kinds of players. Its just a roll every time.  

There should be some kind of unranked system or something just anything so we can play casually, because right now we just cant have fun with it. Or isnt awesomenauts the game for us? Should we find something else?"	t5_2tvrv	True

Thanks to Nazza's suggestion, lets hold a tourney for those new in the game.  I have two ideas:

1) Create two leagues, one where those who have logged less than 40hrs is allowed and another with more than 40.

2) One league that is made up of those who logged in less than 40.  However, exception is one member can be 'pro' AKA logged more than 40hrs.

Rules are no changing characters midgame.  Maps are random for first game then losing team picks map.  Also players can only use the first three skills in each row (many beginners don't have all skills unlocked) with the exception of the bottom row (i.e.I health, piggy bank, etc.).  Best of 3, semifinals best of 5, final best of 7.

I am open to suggestions.  I have games to give away.  I like the second option as it allows vets to mix with newbies.  I will do steam/background checks if necessary on the hrs but should be on an honor system.  This isn't the APL.  It's for fun and for welcoming new players to the community."	t5_2tvrv	True

MrMrUm	32	8	26	"I know the player base is small, not enough players, wanting people to play against people, etc... But allowing players under league 3 to quick match into games with league 1 or 2 players is worse than allowing them to play bots or wait. 

The countless games where a low league, inexperienced player joins either team isnt fun for them, because they will most likely die often and get blamed for the loss. It isnt fun for the team they joined because they probably cant contribute too much. And it shouldnt be fun for the other team unless they like abusing a weakness and having a game with no challenge.

I am certain that the league 6 player in this scenario would much rather wait or play bots than quick match into a game where they are almost sure to lose and feel like its their fault for the loss of the game.  "	t5_2tvrv	True

1375737238.0	1jrloe	A nice tip that I learned from playing yesterday	HeIsMyPossum	26	4	10	"This might be common knowledge, but I found that it worked very well yesterday.

I typically run with my buddy who plays Voltar. I discovered a new sort of meta-strategy:

*When you have a Voltar, take all the health.*

I (as V&amp;S) ran around the map on occasion and nabbed all the health, even when I didn't need it. In fact, I barely ever needed it, because we had the Voltar.

But the problem when you have a Voltar is that the enemy team has almost exclusive access to the health, because most players never go out of their way to get health unless they need it.

By grabbing all the health, you force your opponents to run back or hide behind the turret, either way, it enhances your pushing capabilities.

I actually find that I hunt down the health MORE when I have a Voltar with great healing than when I do not. The reasoning is simple: I have an alternative for health, my opponent does not. They NEED the health bugs to get health, I do not. So I go up every time the bugs respawn and kill all of them.

Oh, and tell your teammates you are doing this, so they know not to rely on it.

td;dr Health Denial is a powerful tool, especially when a Voltar in involved.

EDIT: I should have specified that this works best on the gravity well level where all the health is at the top. The levels with sides are a judgement call on who will need what health when. Always get it from the opposite side."	t5_2tvrv	True

I really wish instead of just dots, you could see who each dot represents. Another thing is since we can't move our screen independently of our characters, I often find myself seeing a bunch of dots jumping around so I dive in, only to find my two teammates are at about 3 hp, or are dead right as I arrive and find myself in a 1v3. Not knowing how the game is made, I can't really determine if making it so the dots were instead mini naught icons would be difficult. But having a bar on the side with teammate health bars would be massively helpful, or anything really indicating your teammates status would be great. I guess the game just feel too blind at points.

Minor fixes

- Fixed that if you joined late in a game, you did not get the extra health that everyone gets based on game duration.
- Fixed that bots on Aiguillon sometimes got stuck on the middle teamwall if all the turrets in only one lane had been destroyed.
- Fixed that the minimap showed a health orb in the wrong place in Ribbit IV.
- Made some changes to hopefully fix a rare issue that particles sometimes did not disappear and remained in the level during the entire match. Not entirely sure, please let us know if this still happens!

1373156998.0	1hrzaz	New Gamemode Idea - Randomnauts	twitche	26	6	6	"Similar to Slowwolfs videos, I think a nice twist of gameplay, something that would be more casual, and could test the skills of players would be to have a random game mode. Here's how it would work-

* each player joining the game would be given a random character at the 
start

* after being assigned an awesomenaut, the player would be given 3 random skills from each row

* once in game, the player may play like they would regular awesomenauts.

Now you might be saying, ""twitches, this is so unfair! What if I get a load of crappy skills?"" Ah, but that is the gem of randomnauts. You could get shit abilities yes,  but so could the opponent. Only the best players could win with what they have. 

Think about all the upsides: premades would have a much harder time, and you could happen across many builds and team comps that you would never have though of, but work fantastically! I know new game modes are hard to do because it would split up the already small community, but maybe someday, if ronimo ever adds a new mode.

I'd love to hear some feedback, if anyone would be behind the idea and things of such. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2tvrv	True

Right now, I have **25 Awesomenauts videos uploaded**. I do a couple of segments as well.


**Challenge Builds** - Viewers can suggest a build that they want to see done (Max Health Clunk, Clone Army Leon, Long Lasting Derpl, etc.). There's a good amount of Challenge videos up so do check them out. Also, if you have a challenge build for me, please do tell me. :D

**Focus** - These types of videos focuses on certain skills and changes that they get every patch. I try my best to highlight what those changes do for the character and how you can use it properly.

**Patchnotes** - Basically, i do a brief breakdown on every patch that comes out. i try to keep them short so i don't go through all changes but i also try to highlight the major ones.


And also, some normal playthroughs as well. (I actually can't wait to cast some of your matches. Come on REPLAY SYSTEM!!)

Every naut now has two flairs: One with their default look, and another with a random DLC skin.

Everyone should now have a default skin as their flair, but if you prefer to have the DLC version as your flair then you can change it by clicking the 'Edit' button on the right.

You can buy bots to go down the lanes, and one of these bots is the Jackbot, which is very powerful. When you take down the enemy's base (their ""Moneyball) jackbots also spawn.

But the neat thing about Jackbots is that they will auto spawn for both teams in waves after the 30 minute mark or so, to speed up the game a bit.

1369870793.0	1faw32	Here's another FAQ for new players. Slightly different from the original.	irrzir	21	2	21	"The [original FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/15xeym/redditnauts_faq/) covered most of the content in here with some other tips to get started. This post is meant to direct you the original FAQ (as in, check it out), while also delivering some answers to things we experienced players take for granted. 

Skim through and find what you need; it's a long list :P

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&gt; What's the objective?

* The objective of the game is to destroy the other team's Drill Core before they destroy yours. Preventing you from doing so is 3-4 turrets, of which you must destroy in order to reach the core. 

&gt; How do I destroy turrets?

* You can't normally take down a turret by yourself. That's what the droid's are here for. Droids spawn from your base in pairs, and will march down each lane until they reach a turret, which is where their shields kick in. Attacking safely behind your droids, and removing anything in their way is the proper way to destroy a turret.

&gt; What is my loadout?

* Your loadout is the grid-screen that you see before you enter the match. When you pick your character, you can edit his/her loadout by clicking on the items that you want. You can choose up to three loadout items per ability, and they are activated in-game by purchasing them with solar.

&gt; How do I buy my loadout items?

* When your rocket drops, move towards the battlefield until you see a green aura. This aura is both a healing area and a shop. By default, the button to open the shop is ""E"". You can teleport back here by holding ""F"" or ""Shift"".

&gt; Is there a way to see how much health you have?

* You can see the amount of health your 'naut starts with when you're at the character selection screen. In-game, there is no numerical value, but your health meter is split up into ""bars""; each of these bars is equal to 20hp.

&gt; How do I regain health?

* Health can be regained by the following methods:

1. Standing in the green shop area quickly refills your health. Teleporting back here for spending and healing is advised if you are significantly low. 

2. Grabbing the big green health orbs yield 50 HP. These spawn regularly throughout the map in the same position every time.

3. Killing the small ""neutral creeps"" gives you a small green health orb.

4. Purchasing Med-I-Can (bottom row of most Awesomenaut loadouts) gets you health regeneration. (2hp/second* per level)

5. Recieve healing from Voltar, Genji, or Yuri.

6. Purchase a lifestealing ability (some 'nauts don't have any).

&gt; How do I ""level up""?

* Your in-game level (the number next to your name) goes up one level per 100 solar (money). Your level dictates nothing and is swayed solely by the amount of solar that you've made.

&gt; How do I make solar (money)?

* You can make solar a few ways: 

1. You automatically generate solar at 1 solar per 2 seconds (and you start with some solar when you start/join a game). Solar generation can be increased to 53 solar/minute via the ""Solar Tree"" upgrade (in the bottom row of all Awesomenauts)
2. The ""Piggy Bank"" utility upgrade gives you an extra 150 solar to start the match (bottom row of all Awesomenauts).
3. Picking up ""solar cubes"". Silver cubes grant you 1 solar, while gold cubes grant you 5 solar.
4. Killing enemies grants you 60 solar, while also giving your allies 30 solar. 
5. Killing neutral creeps (the small, harmless ones that give you health).
6. Killing enemy droids yields 5 solar. 
7. Destroying Turrets grants the killer 50 solar, with 30 solar given to the rest of the team. 
8. Healing (voltar only)

&gt; What benefit is there to prestiging?

* None! Upon reaching level 95*, you have the option to prestige. Prestiging grants you an icon and resets your level to 16 (not all the way). However, you can deny the prestige and pick it back up at any time in the settings menu. There are currently 10 prestige levels and the badges are purely cosmetic. Some like the challenge, but some don't like the tediousness of it.

&gt; How do I [all] chat?

* Shift+Enter at the same time.

&gt; What is my rank?

* Your rank is determined by your spot on the leaderboards which are, in turn, determined by your win/loss ratio. The rank's purpose is to aid in the matchmaking system (which may not always deliver perfect results). 

&gt; What do skins do?

* Skins are obtained via promotional events or are otherwise directly purchasable through Steam. They have no effect on gameplay and are just re-textures of existing Awesomenauts (with some audio changes).

&gt; Will there be new characters?

* Yes! Ronimo is great about constantly updating the game with new skins, characters, and most recently: a new map! We can safely expect more characters in the future. 

*Fixes courtesy of /u/MrMrUm and /u/ehkoe

For example, if you deal most of the damage and another player gets the kill, they should get the kill credit but you should get at least an assist or even a shared kill. If it's the same but a bot or turret finishes them off then you should get full kill credit. Also if you stun, slow, throw, pull etc. an enemy into a turret then you should also get at least an assist. Also in Voltar's case or anyone else who can heal you should get an assist for healing a team mate who gets the kill.

I find that a lot of classes are geared towards assists, and although they probably get solar, they are otherwise unrecognised for their work.

1371443495.0	1ghv24	An unexpected journey. My story about what I've learned, and why Nauts is so Awesome.	NetherPlebiscite	30	12	7	"My internet is out so I am posting this from my phone out of boredom and to satisfy my addiction to this amazing game.

This February I went over to a friends house and there are three grown men sitting about a foot from a 52"". They are high fiving and cursing in unison and rambling about frogs and droids and lag. It looks like a cartoon or some sweet SNES game I somehow missed. Then comes my turn. I get roflstomped by some large guy that explodes. Anyway, after about an hour I got the hang of it to at least have fun. And it began. I haven't put it down since. Every defeat still stings, every victory hard fought and celebrated. My old days of WoW PvP were flashing back and I hit the forums. Every game getting better at learning how to counter, how to be patient and take advantage of power plays. Falling deeper into addiction. I didn't care that double bullet frog was op and broken. I didn't care voltar was useless in quick match and you couldn't trust random gamers to know how to play (even more crippling on consoles since you can't even type for communication). I just love playing the game.

Then I came to the dark side. I got a steam account and told the controller goodbye. And I haven't looked back.

So all cries about ayla rage being op (I don't think the move itself is, just the costs and how quickly it maxes out) aside, and all complaints about bad sports and rage quitters...deep down I can honestly say ronimo has done a damn fine job. It is original. It is fun. It is very competitive and strategic. It is constantly being balanced and they do a great job for such a small company at making it work.

So here are a few tips I learned which most know or have heard, but the bundle brought a new round of late bloomers. So here it goes how to win every game.

1. It is 3v3 not you vs them. 
You have two team mates for a reason. The game is balanced counting on the fact that you are a 1/3 piece of a unit. Especially if you are in a pug (pick up group) of random people you don't know...please stay together. Or at least communicate and work together.

2. Don't die. 
Dying is bad. Every death snowballs how bad it is. Obviously you feed the enemy money, but that is a side note. If you die, it is 3v2. Which means both your allies could die easily if they aren't more careful. It is also harder to defend a turret with three enemies beating you back behind it. Always be aware of the mini map. Know your escape routes if you get in trouble. If you are low HP and don't have regen or creeps nearby just go heal. Being away for 10 seconds is better than dying. Always remember, if the enemy has a Leon and you hang out in the middle at low HP you might as well just type in all chat you want to fly down in the spaceship thingy again.

3. Adapt. You pick a naut and you pick a build. Great. You probably have an order in mind of what items you will buy. That's great and all but it is rare you can buy the exact items in the exact order every game. They have a gnaw/skoldir or someone has a dot (damage over time) move? Might want regen sooner. Damage is important, but if you are having to teleport or run away a lot, maybe buying your survival items first will be better. See #2 above.

4. Kill all the droids.
Just chasing down and killing their droids is more useful and helpful than getting kills. You get money and you protect your turrets by doing so. The goal is to get past the turrets to kill the base. Not kill nauts. And killing all the droids makes it really hard to push. Just kill them it is that simple.

5. Awareness.
Always be looking at the minimap. Know where your allies are (even though they should be on screen mostly) know where the enemies are. Know where the closest creep or health pack is. Just know where everything is. At all times. Also when you have a quick second to check (for me usually when I go back to upgrade) check what the enemy is buying. Leon doesn't have stealth yet? Lonestar has life steal o mite? Good things to know.

6. Don't be a dick.
If you die, even if it truely honestly WAS lag. Just suck it up. It happens. You have gotten at least one kill from lag at some point. I like to take the 5-30 seconds before respawn to reflect. How did I die? Was I just out played? Did I over extend? Am I being too aggressive? If I think about how I got killed and not blame antything I can bounce back, and more so not let emotions drive me into 10 rageicides and a ragequit. On that note, don't give up just cause they got a turret or two ahead. Comebacks happen a lot especially if they push too hard and get cocky. If your teammate sucks and is going 1/15 don't call him out in all chat. Try to be subtle in team chat like ""hey remember how you got raped 3v1 cause you keep running out alone over and over? Maybe try to stick closer to us"". We all have bad games, don't judge them or be a dick.

So thats all I can think of now. Any correction or add ons are welcome. Happy hunting.

See you, Space Cowboy."	t5_2tvrv	True

So let's talk about some of the good community stories you've had, the ones that leave you with that warm glowing feeling and a smile on your face!

My own: Playing public with 2 of my friends (Coco, Ray, Froggy) on Ribbit IV. The other team (Vinne/Ayla/Leon) had us totally locked in behind our turrets, and owned the jungle. It was a long gruelling game, chipping each other's turrets and not many kills. At the same time, there was a bit of friendly jibbing going on in the chat. We were both holding our back turrets and the game was pretty standstillish. Finally they took our back bottom turret, and the top one fell soon after. 

Instead of slowly chipping out our base, they went all in and a massive clusterfcuk ensued.for a split second everyone on both teams had about 2 pixels of health, but somehow our team survived, and only ayla lasted on their side. As she fled to the jungle to heal, I screamed PUSH and we all ran to their base. We killed it in what was probably one of the hypest things I've ever done in games.

Expecting a string of hatred or rage quits, I was really chuffed to see that everyone stuck around to the end and everyone had a good chat about it too. The other team were very gracious in defeat and we said our goodbyes. The perfect game.

So, what's your nice community story for awesomenauts? "	t5_2tvrv	True

I'm gonna give the reasons why I think nauts are good (maybe too good) though, just so we have a starting point for discussion. I won't go that much in-depth on nauts I don't play since that's not really being fair to them.


**Froggy G**: Play him a little bit. A good Froggy can be annoying, a bad one can be an easy feast. Overall I feel he's balanced but then again I haven't used all of the upgrades for him yet, especially his tornado (and there's some interesting ones in there).


**Lonestar**: If I want to push and make life difficult for the enemy, then I pick Lonestar.

* Dynamite deals good consistent damage to turrets (especially if you buy the triple dynamite upgrade), act as a good burst or escape tool (blind) and just makes you generally annoying.

* Bull is great cc since if done right will push the enemy back into your team or tower and lead to their death. It also helps immensely with pushing or solo tower tanking in a way nobody else can compare with.


**Leon**: Play him occasionally. I can see why his tongue is an important ability to have in this game, it helps deal with some otherwise difficult stuff in an easier manner. Can't decide how to feel about him since he feels necessary but... I don't like getting pulled and backstabbed either lol.


**Clunk**: Has amazing health and burst potential and I try to exploit that as early as possible. However, at least since I've started playing he feels weak especially because of Genji's prevalence. I don't play missile Clunk so I can't comment on that.

* Bite -&gt; Explosion combined with Clunk's tankiness make him a real threat on the battlefield, especially if he has the snare/slow upgrades and is with someone else who can help lock down the enemy team

* Genji is essentially a hardcounter to an explosion Clunk as he cannot detonate if cocooned


**Voltar**: Don't really play him. His healing has made for some scary pushes but I feel like Genji shuts down his primary benefactors too hard for him to be considered strong right now.


**Gnaw**: Pretty decent at playing defense, his DoT can be hard to deal with without a reasonable health pool or health regen/lifesteal. Seedlings can be annoying depending on where he places them.

* Good defender since seedlings can help fortify turrets

* Good duelist since his spit DoT can melt people

* Good for setting traps with dropping spit and seedlings


**Coco**: Arguable who's better for poking between her and Rae. Ball Lightning doesn't force you to stay in place and can go through walls, and is accompanied by some decent knockback.

* Her poke can become ridiculous, especially since it can be hard to dodge and easily catch you off guard with the enhanced travel speed.

* Her slow/DoT allows her to dodge chasers and set up enemies to get mauled by the rest of her team.


**Skølldir**: I don't play him but man, he's dumb to face. Has some crazy lockdown (3 forms of cc) and DoT combined with the fact that he's tanky. Not fun.


**Yuri**: Yuri feels like a big offender of balance at the moment (at least at higher unlock levels). Mines can be a problem but the biggest problem with him is his slow field. Honestly the size upgrade makes it HUGE and impossible to escape from him. Add to that the upgrades that make his slow even worse to deal with (and a slow on his laser) and his teammates, you're basically screwed if you get caught by him.

* Mines are good for helping waveclear/area denial/setting up traps but **generally** require strategy in placement.

* As mentioned his slow field is ridiculous. Some teams will just find it impossible to deal with.


**Raelynn**: I like playing her, lots of people that end up in my games like playing her. There's a reason, it's really easy to get fed with her and even if your snipes don't always work out she has a strong kit to fall back on, since her autos and slow field can deal ridiculous damage.

* +50 Solar on kill makes it really easy to snowball

* High damage long range nuke murders squishies, punishes tanks and (sorta) reveals stealth

* Slow punishes enemy nauts who get caught in it heavily, especially a deployed Derpl because by the time he exits turret mode he's basically dead

* Good duelist with autoattacks, especially with the upgrade on her slow that jacks up her autoattack damage after cast


**Derpl**: I don't really play cat Derpl and haven't seen it yet so I don't know how good it is. However I know how good turret Derpl can be in the hands of a good player.

* Snare -&gt; Turret -&gt; Nuke combo can be very hard to deal with and will straight-up kill squishier nauts.

* Good Derpls will deploy on fall-through floors, as they can still fall through when deployed allowing them an easier escape.

* Very good pusher, if allowed to he will just destroy turrets in no time flat.

**Vinnie and Spike**: He annoys me, I know that. He has good burst, mobility and on top of that his smokescreen is a really easy escape move. I can't play him worth a shit though.


**Genji**: Now I know how people feel about him, and honestly I can see where they are coming from. Genji feels like he was intended to be a jack of all trades, master of none however he does his jobs just as well if not better than more specialized characters and that should change. It's bad to the point where you feel like you've lost if the enemy team has a Genji who isn't braindead and you don't.

* Autoattack modifier that is really good at waveclear and zoning

* Excellent cc that neutralizes channels and Clunk's explosion; also packs more utility on top of that with team healing and %hp damage upgrades

* Monarch Blessing can help lots of incoming damage, heal teammates and speed them up, among other things

These are just my thoughts though, curious what people think about everyone since I am new to this and unfamiliar with whatever the meta is and the overall opinion on most 'Nauts."	t5_2tvrv	True

Because of this, I have found myself looking at a lot of build guides and tips. I know a lot of the people who make these frequent this subreddit, so I have a request: please put the patch version somewhere prominent in your guide. 

Romino have been great by constantly putting in balance fixes, but it means each character performs differently, sometimes changing the entire character (like Gnaw's spit staying on the ground). As such, some guides become outdated. Now, I know that many of the guide makers are doing this out of the goodness of their hearts and for fun, and I get that no one is gonna go back and correct facts on a months old guide, but if you put the patch number in, at least we can do the research ourselves to figure out the changes and determine how relevant the guide is

Seriously though, I am very grateful to all you guys who make guides and do videos. You are helping this community thrive, and become something I am really glad to be a part of. Thanks for all your hard work

There have been games where I am playing fine, no lag with ping below 100, and suddenly I disconnect out of the blue, with the ""Lost connection to host"" error popping up. The game even identifies me having disconnecting because of a random problem with my connection to the host, its not like my network connection was lost as if I unplugged my router or a cable. And then there are times when everyone in game has ping around 100 to me except for one person with 600 ping, and the game decides to migrate the host to him, making me disconnect seconds later. 

Being disconnected shouldnt count as a full loss, especially when the game identifies its a problem with a ping spike or a bad host and not an unplugged network cable. It could be counted as a disconnect, being separate to a loss, and making you lose some rating but not as ridiculous as a full loss. There have been countless games where my team has the advantage with little to no chance of losing, only to disconnect and lose a bunch of rating that you have to win 3 more matches to make up for.

**TLDR** Disconnects shouldnt count as a loss when most of the time it isnt the players fault, rather it should be a less severe rating punishment



EDIT: Yes, yes, I am aware and have heard the story of Swords and Soldiers leaderboard with unplugging the cable, etc... and the apparent inability to distinguish between an unplugged network cable with a host connection problem. Thing is though, to an extent, the game *can* distinguish. A network cable being unplugged will always cause a complete loss of internet connection, causing a ""Network connection"" error to be acknowledged by the game. However, a disconnection caused by ping or Host problems are different, the game acknowledges them as ""Lost connection to host"" errors, with error codes 0x0000008 or 0x00000009. In this way its pretty obvious when someones kicked for ping to the host problems in comparison to physically unplugging a cable. The only way this might be exploited is if someone starts to intentionally cause their ping to become high, in which case this is time consuming, and probably will not even work, wasting their time and effort. 

**TLDR of EDIT** The game can somewhat tell the difference between host problems and unplugged network cables."	t5_2tvrv	True
1370674957.0	1fwzgc	Alright, that's it. I'm officially walking away from this game until matchmaking is fixed.	HeIsMyPossum	31	17	15	"Edit 2: Getting some downvotes. Please read through the whole post. If you have issues with what I've said, please comment or start a discussion about what you disagree with.

Matchmaking has literally ruined the game for me. I made time tonight to play with my brother and our good friend. Out of 5 games, the other team, on average, had prestiged at least once per person (often several times). EDIT: We are all less than level 50, and around 20-30 hours played. Nowhere close to the same skill level.

We played 2 teams that had rank 1 players, and the other 3 that had rank 2s or higher. We are rank 3 or 4. The games weren't even close. I was earning between 1.5k or less points after the game... that's how fast they were going.

This game just isn't fun anymore. We get matched against people way above our skill level. Even when we win, we normally are matched against ranks 5-7 that are just dog shit and it's not even fun then. During one of the games against the rank 1 players, they said it wasn't fun for them either.

I'm a big Starcraft 2 player that has brilliant matchmaking. I'm used to losing (I do quite often in SC2), but at least I know I have a chance. Here it just seems like I'm fucked from the beginning. It makes me just want to leave the game the moment I enter it.

Until something with matchmaking is revamped, I'm putting this game down for good, simply because it's not fun anymore. I don't care if I lose, it's the fact that I can't even compete. Winning or losing, there's no competition. Competition drives games.

Edit: I don't have a ""perfect"" solution for how matchmaking should work or what system would solve everything. But that's not my job. It's a broken system, as this community has stated, and needs to be fixed. As far as how? I know everyone has ideas, but it's up to Romino to fix it.

AbsurdWebLingo	23	7	26	"- Bots do not recognize invis orb on Aguillon. They will just stand there and stare at it but never deny the other team the invis if they have the chance unless they happen to run into it. Major disadvantage in matches with bots on that level right now.

- Bots on your own team will jump on the worm button intentionally to kill you. Literally they will run over it, jump down to one side, you'll run under and while you're under they will jump back up to hop on the button. Little assholes.

- Bots will occasionally just hop around doing plyometrics in your team base during matches. *I have only had this experience once with a Froggy bot on Aguillon and have not yet seen it recreated, second and third confirmation would be nice.*

- Raelynn Time Rift does no damage to weedlings. This has been mentioned in other posts. I have seen it myself a couple of times last night.

- Occasionally get stuck on character selection screen after selecting a character.

- Occasionally stuck in Initializing Game screen.

- Genji will occasionally deal random damage from butterfly shot misses . I don't know what this was. There was a Genji firing butterfly shots upward from the nest in the top half of Ribbit in anticipation of bots. I was up at the very top of the map (as Vinnie) and then moved behind my turret to grab health/solar, after being past the turret without ever being close to the shot I got ""hit"" by it several times and died. Genji and my reaction: ""wut."" ""I don't even know, was thinking the same thing myself.""

- Invis to invis occasionally gets a bit crazy on Aguillon. If you are invis with Vinnie's smoke screen and grab the orb, it will not change over to the 30 second invis *sometimes*. Sometimes it will, sometimes it will not, just a guessing game really.

- Nauts occasionally showing empty HP bars and refusing to die. One post showing Derpl currently with empty bar. Played one match against a Froggy who just refused to die with 0 HP showing as well. HP visibility fix?

- Via [Gregar's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/1e2dbf/let_us_compile_a_list_of_the_bugsbot_ai_issues_we/c9w48lh) bots, if you are above them, in my experience in particular with Clunk bot, and firing at them, they will just stand there and tank damage for awhile without moving. You can pretty easily get a few standard weapon shots off and then one of your larger powered skills off before he will recognize anything is actually happening and attack or retreat.

- Via [LeD3athZ0r's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Awesomenauts/comments/1e2dbf/let_us_compile_a_list_of_the_bugsbot_ai_issues_we/c9w5qsj) Bots also will not recognize Yuri's mines. They just run right on into 'em because fuck you that's why.

1376326526.0	1k7snf	Tips and the general metagame of Awesomenauts.	mikluap	18	3	20	"**Metagame**

The meta has slight variations depending on builds, build orders, and different nauts, but this is just the general meta. There are exceptions, but again, this is generalized advice. 

1. Stay with your allies almost ALWAYS. Exceptions are late game when someone has to backdoor, or when someone has to clear the other lane. After clearing the lane, you can push the turret while the enemy is preoccupied with defending the other turret, but do so being very attentive to the minimap. 

2. Do not overextend. More times than not, it's not worth getting a kill. Overextending will just force your allies to help you and put themselves in danger as well, leading to potential wipeouts. 

3. Push whenever you get the chance. If an enemy is killed, immediately push the turrets. If an enemy went back to heal or buy upgrades, clear the lanes of any droids asap and push. 

4. Only go back to base when your team can afford to have people go back. It's usually better to stay out longer with slightly weaker upgrades than to go back every time you can afford to buy something else. I usually go back with an average of 400 solar. It's only good to go back with barely enough solar to buy when you have a clear advantage, which is usually late game. The last thing you want to do is have everyone go back at the same time and have no defense on the turrets (this has happened to me a lot during pub games). The only exception to going back is if you have no means of getting health and you need it ASAP. 

(A good Clunk will almost never go back to base for health, only for buying upgrades. Clunk can rely on his bite alone on droids, enemies, and neutral critters to stay out for as long as he likes.)


**Tips**

1. If your turret is being attacked with droids and enemy nauts, focus killing the droids first. The enemy is using them as protection and once the droids are gone, they will most likely back off the turret depending on how tanky they are or if it's late game. This tip is obviously situational and in many cases it's smarter to attack the enemy nauts before the droids (i.e., if they have low health, if you or an ally can snare/trap them for a gank)

2. When you are defending a turret that's about to be destroyed, get ready to retreat at around 2 bars. If you stay too long, a smart Vinnie, Raelynn, Froggy, Skolldir, or just about anyone can get a kill very quickly as soon as the turret drops. So assume that they will use their skills (dash, dive, snipe, etc) as soon as the turret drops. Alternatively, if you're attacking a turret that's on the brink of getting destroyed, have your skills ready to attack any defending enemies. Froggy's Splash Dash, Vinnie's Spike Dive and Raelynn's Snipe seem to be perfect for this.

3. If your turret is going to go down, let an enemy droid finish it off, because then the solar from the turret will drop onto the floor allowing one of your teammates to get it, or yourself. The enemy team still gets solar though but doesn't give them as much.""- tojnagag

Aside from the obvious broken upgrades and bug exploits like being able to drop your anchor and melt turrets down with 30 damage every .7 seconds, Swiggins' core mechanics felt unbalanced. His hookshot wasn't nearly as useful of an escape capability as I thought it would be and his anchor drop skill, honestly, felt really unfair and unneeded in the game's current state. It's an enhanced cocoon. I would recommend decreasing the amount of hp it takes to destroy the anchor or decrease the duration, maybe even make it a skill shot so you can't spam it as much.

I bought Awesomenauts in the Humble Bundle for $6 two weeks ago but didn't play it until a couple of days ago because I dislike most MOBAs. I now think it is the strongest game in the bundle.

My first play of the game resulted in a 1/7 k/d and defeat but I instantly liked the game. I really like the cartoony style and think it is a lot less stressful and aggressive than other MOBAs. There is a lot of content to get on with, resulting in many hours of playing time.

I just wish I had persuaded my friends to get the Humble Bundle so we could play together as a team (as a side note: has anybody got any spare steam keys for my friends?).

I recently advanced up to League 8 but I am still bad at the game and I am learning new tactics and tricks all the time.

Overall, I think this game is awesome and I would have happily payed more money for it if it was not in the HB.

Only to find ourselves starting with &gt;1200 Solar, all of our turrets destroyed, and our base getting crushed.

Two problems here: a) as I said, we *should* simply have a set of options that either allows us to start a new match, or choose to join an existing one; b) far too many people ragequit because the decreased Solar gain is a far smaller penalty than moving down a league. I *never* quit a match (unless I'm forced to by outside circumstances) just because I'm losing -- and I've won a handful because I didn't. I had this same problem when I bothered playing Dota 2 -- ""oh, the first ten minutes didn't go my way, fuck everyone else on my team.""

I know point B is a tricky one to address, but can point A at least get put in? Please? Pretty please?

When I play alone, I get into some very easy games, some very difficult games, the games with trolls, and the everything in between. It feels like there is diversity and a whole bunch of people to find. When I bring my friend along (we are both tier 3/4, unprestiged) we found nothing but the same 3 or so groups of guys, all higher ranked than us. Every game it was pretty much the same. We would get steam rolled in 20 minutes flat. It made me not want to play with my friend, just so we could play fair games. We were literally less than 20ft apart. And our 3rd random teammate wasn't ever to bad, they didn't die an excessive number of times and farmed a good bit. I know Ronimo focused on making matchmaking fast &gt; balanced, but it was just unfun getting curb stomped like that. /rant	t5_2tvrv	True

I think this is annyoing, because its a very different feeling. Playing against human beings is just better.

1371888443.0	1guiel	Advice for a new Voltar player?	pilcher_Z	16	3	21	"I've been playing for a while now so I'm not totally new, I just only picked up Volt the other day. (And I love him!) I just wanted to see if any other Volt mains had advice on being successful with him. 
As far as my build goes I go:


* Droids: Four, Blind, Spawn 

* Bot: Longevity, Turret, Cooldown

* Auto: Heal more, big heal more, push back

* Body: Boots, Medi-Can, Solar Tree




I opted out of the money on heal because I wanted to double my heal on my auto to counter the fact that I'm not taking heal boost on bot. The build is meant to be more of a poke/push thing to help my team win team fights and snipe people when the least expect it diving us. 


Are any of these useless? It's too soon for me to tell since I just started with this guy. 


I typically start Solar Tree and go into Healbot, bying the turret upgrades when I can. From there I go into blind bots. If there is someone like Ayla or Leon on their team I buy knock back to stay alive about at this point, but if not I try and max out cooldown and sustain on the healbot, picking up health and speed where needed. I usually max auto attack heals last unless there is a gnaw heavy on spit or something. I've been thinking about replacing Medi-Can with pills and try for tanky push/heal kind of thing. 


Any tips?

The goal of this is for anyone to ask any thing related to Awesomenauts and hopefully the community can help answer. This is a great place to ask that question that has been annoying you, but you think it does not warrant its own thread. I am in no way an Awesomenauts guru so I most likely wont be able to answer most questions so I hope that everyone gets involved and tries to help out others.

While I find this a bigger problem against the bots, it still does occur a significant amount against human players. Clunk already had one of the largest health pools, and he can quickly refill it with Vacuum Bite.  Therefore, it takes a lot of effort to whittle his health down, and it's so frustrating to chase down a retreating Clunk only to have him explode instantly upon death giving you no time to react. This is especially hard for the melee characters who have to get in close to deal the final blow, but then they also end up dead after they are caught in the explosion.  I feel the reason it takes a couple of seconds for his explosion to go off normally because that gives the players time to react, and being able to deal 100 damage instantly to an area would be too powerful.

When I used it, though, I realized that it wasn't lowering my cooldown *by* four seconds, but rather it lowered it *to* four seconds. Eight seconds left and Smokescreen? Down to four. Six seconds left and Smokescreen? Down to four. And if the cooldown was below four seconds then it didn't affect the cooldown at all. I tested it in the private match and in a practice match afterwards to see what happened and it was the same every time, unaffected by stage, team comp, private or practice match, or what items I had bought. Is anyone else getting this? Has anyone said anything about it? Is it a bug? If it's on purpose then I feel the tooltip for the WPM shouldn't simply say ""-4 sec"" as that's misleading.

5-12-2012
Discuss here !

Character balance/fixes
-New! The two stage power pills turbo renamed to power pills light
-Power pills light now has its own icon
-Power pills light price reduced from 135 Solar to 110 Solar

Gnaw
-Power pills turbo replaced with power pills light

Clunk
-NEW! Blue print container now increases damage of explode to 100 damage below 50% health instead of reducing death time (damage does not stack with Thermonuclear cleaner).
-Blue print container price increased from 0 Solar to 145 Solar

Raelynn
-Jump height increased a bit
-Renamed Raelynn’s jump to “Six million Solar” human jump. 
-Snipe, Iron rifle price reduced from 300 to 260
-Snipe, Iron rifle damage increased from 14 to 15 damage
-Snipe, Pump rifle damage increased from 7 to 10 damage

Major fixes and improvements
-Made several fixes to ranking calculations, hopefully fixing the issue that rankings were sometimes reset.
-Added an option to the launcher to disable some of the multithreading in Awesomenauts (so that the game uses less CPU cores). Disabling this is not recommended, but we expect turning this off might fix the large number of framerate hickups that some users are getting.
-Controllers now work in the Launcher (to make the game work better with Steam Big Picture mode).
-The control scheme menu now works completely with controllers.

Minor fixes
-Several minor control scheme and HUD fixes.
-Fixed empty unlocks under some circumstances.
-Fixed counter on flying droid spawner on AI Station 404 after host migration.

Special thanks to Kewn for helping with the stream in a more managerial way, and also for being awesome.

Special thanks also to Weazel, Naaza, and Roy who were with me for the vast majority of the stream and essentially co-hosted the whole deal. Especially to Weazel for keeping the stream going when I had to go see a man about a donkey.

I just played the most fun game I've played so far. I think the game lasted around 40-50 minutes. My team was Skolldir, Gnaw, and Ayla (myself). Opposing team was Gnaw, Genji and Derpl. Match took place on AI Station. It took a full 10 minutes just to blow up the first turret on our side, and from there it was constant battling back and forth as we finally took out theirs. Over 20 min later we finally blew up their top tower and started attacking the base. About 30 seconds later they blew up ours as both sides suffered casualties. Both teams then regrouped to duke it out all over the map, retreating and regrouping, then pushing and being countered. We tried for a big push but suffered 2 casualties leaving gnaw to defend the base against all 3. Skolldir and I land and launch an all out attack. I get derpl and gnaw to half health and then evil eye derpl to get him to 10% as he kills me. Skolldir double kills them and runs for their base. Genji is retreating as our gnaw takes him out and they finish destroying the enemy base together. No talk of OP characters or bad balancing, just good competitive fun. Best game I've had yet and makes me love this game even more. Definitely makes up for the previous game full of complainers. So to you 5 who played with me, keep it up and thanks!	t5_2tvrv	True

The link should jump to the very end. Pause right as the base explodes and look at the leaderboard. This is a perfect example of what infuriates me in this game. 3x premade of rank-2 + L10 prestige goes up against a 3, 4, and 6+L1P?
  
Is there any great surprise **the other team didn't land a single kill** and were completely steamrolled? This is the kind of crap that makes this game not fun. I'm not blaming Naaza at all, but these matches shouldn't ever happen. Is it any great surprise people rage quit or blow a gasket when match-ups are like this?  
  
Maybe I'm over-sensitive as this happens to me constantly especially since being bumped to R3 and getting clobbered every match, or the inevitable 3vme+bots which is equally infuriating.  
  
I **REALLY** want to like this game, and maybe it's just a matter of getting a group together and always playing with premades, but this seems absolutely broken despite the balancing efforts. It's not a balance thing as much as a matchmaking thing.

**Intro**

I haven't seen any good froggy threads yet so I decided to make one myself.


1.15 brought everyone a lot of changes, so it did for our friendly neighborhood gangster frog. I want to line out a classic (1.14) build, discuss how it is affected by the changes and figure out if there is a way to possibly come up for something new. A whole new playstyle perhaps?! (Spoiler)


**Classic 1.14 Froggy**


The classic build very much focused on early triangle dashes, cubes and tweeters to finish it off. The relatively low cost of hammer pants, cubes and tweeters made it possible to be strong early while still having a great late game potential.

A lot of builds looked something like this:

&gt; Ice Cubes / Hammer Pants / Hydro Smash

&gt; Boombox or Turbo Tape / Twisted Tweeters / RBay

&gt; Piranha Cartridges / Mutant Worms / Thorn Fish or Range

&gt; Power Pills Light / Power Pills / Piggy Bank, Space Air Max or Med-i'-can


The build order would be as followed:

Mandatory:

&gt; Power Pills -&gt; Splash Dash -&gt; Tornado -&gt; Hammer Pants -&gt; Ice Cubes -&gt; Twister Tweeters ; 1110 solar

Possible follow ups:

&gt; Thornfish -&gt; Mutant Worms -&gt; Piranha Cartridges ; 1070 solar 

&gt; Boom Box / RBay ; 630 solar

&gt; Boots, med-i'-can or/and Pill Light ; * solar 


This is pretty straight forward and I don't expect too many questing about this. I would just like request that everyone who is about to propose one of those silly glass canon, clocks, hit&amp;run builds to just not bother with there post 



**Patch notes 1.15**


*Dash*

- Base stun duration 0.5 -&gt; 0.7

- Ice Cubes stun duration +0.5 -&gt; +0.4

- Ice Cubes cost 160-&gt; 175

- Hydro splash cost 140 -&gt; 120

- Hydro Smash cost 320 -&gt; 280

- Clock Necklace cost 190 -&gt; 200

- Golden watch cost 120 -&gt; 110

- Hammer Pants split into two stages giving +12 damage, cost 220 -&gt; 130


Stun duration got changed to a higher base and a lower upgrade. The changes are in the 0.1-0.2 second range so don't notice them a whole lot. I haven't yet figured out how the froggy self stun gets affected due to the default and changed times being so god damn short 


In the end it's the same duration though, however you'll be at a slight advantage when you pick up cubes later. The price got increased making the cubes 30 solar more expensive.


The Hydro price reduction are welcome, they used to be really expensive and bought really really late. Hence why there in the classic build loudout yet not in the follow up build order.


Clock price changes are really minor and why would you even run clocks? Solar is better spend somewhere more useful.


Hammer pants got a stage and price increase, the result is pretty straight forward; 40 solar more expensive.


The summary of these changes for the classic dash build, 60 solar more expensive and this is all part of the mandatory upgrades.


*Tornado Move*

- Right Back at Ya cost 290 -&gt; 300

- Can't touch this shield +40 -&gt; +60

- Twister Tweeters deal 50% damage vs. turrets


RBay got a 10 solar price increase, again pretty straight forward; 10 solar more expensive.

CTT, no one used it, doubt the 20 added points will convince people to use instead of Rbay or damage/speed upgrades.

Turret damage was never the main focus for your TT, yet it did it really well. Good change.

The summary of these changes for the classic dash build, 10 solar more expensive and less turret damage on tweeters, this is all part of the mandatory upgrades/loadout.


*Fish Gun*

- Viridian Eel Cartridges cost 225 -&gt; 140

- Change Mutant Worms: Ninja Edition, deal +15 damage after landing whirlwind or dash, effect dissipates after 5 seconds, cost 110 -&gt; 190

Viridian Eel Cartridges, was never used a lot. the main reason being that froggys base range is so short and combined with range it would take 2/3 of your slots. The price was not the reason you did not take this upgrade, nor will it be this time around.

Ninja Worms, this is a really interesting change. The old worms were not used a lot since froggy is already fast by default and you could just click shoot, keeping your movement speed mostly unaffected until you bought the ninja worms. (no way you can click time that).

The new ninja worms open up a lot of new possibilities. 190 solar solar for in theory 30 damage, (in theory it sounds really great).

The classic build is unaffected by these changes.

Yes it is really great 


*General*

- Power pills lite health 30 -&gt; 25, cost 110 -&gt; 150, 3rd stage added

Pills... Make up your mind Ronma! 

Changes, 15 more health for 200 more solar.

Pills is always going to be mandatory for every naut and every build (but but pilless... Yes, yes I know, but we've been over this). This results in a 200 solar increase for your 'mandatory' build.

**Summary**

Classic froggy got a lot of really small hits, but they do add up. 

There is a total 60 solar increase for you're ealy game items as well as an aditional 200 solar increase for mandatory pills. And 10 for Rbay.

Tweeter turret damage, turret damage.



This might not seem as a whole lot, but you also have to take in considerationg that most other nauts got a buff to their early game. 

That makes these changes have a higher impact than they seem to at first glance.

Now let's see how we can take advantage of the changes classic froggy doesn't use and take a look at my solution for these issues.




**New 1.15 Froggy**

This bit is going to be my solution for 1.15, meaning I won't do or's and buts and just explain what I roll with and why.

I concluded that classic Froggy took a early game blow, your early game is nerfed purely by solar cost. While a lot of other nauts got early game buffs.

My solution for this resolves around the new Ninja worms, relying more on my utility row and moving the classic mandatory upgrades further into my build order.


*The new loadout*

&gt; Hydro splash / Ice cubes / Hydro Smash

&gt; Turbo Tape / Tisted Tweeters / RBay

&gt; Piranha Cartridges / Ninja worms / Thornfish

&gt; Power Pills Light / Med-i'-can / Power Pills


The build order would be as followed:

Mandatory:

 &gt;Power Pills -&gt; Splash Dash -&gt; Tornado -&gt; Ninja Worms -&gt; med-i'-can -&gt; Turbo Tape (1 rank) -&gt; Twister Tweeters ; 1140 solar

Possible follow ups:

&gt; Ice Cubes ; 350 solar

&gt; Thornfish -&gt; Piranha Cartridges ; 740 solar 

&gt; RBay ; 300 solar

&gt; Pill Light ; 450 solar

&gt; Hydro Smash -&gt; Hydro Splash ; 640 solar


Some things of you might notice right away is the absence of hammer pants, boombox and mutant worms.
You won't miss any of the three much though and the reason for it is one simple 190 solar upgrade, the new ninja worms!


You start off as you always have, drop down get WoS, pills -&gt; Dash, collect some solar then go back for tornado early or save up 325 solar for both tornado and ninja worms and then go back.

After you build into ninja worms you're first change from classic froggy starts. While classic froggy would have triangle dashes, the new froggy will dash then shot you once. This allows for dash agles you otherwise wouldn't take.

You can dow perfectly dash a mid air Yuri, Lonestar, Coco. Follow up with a ninja shot, this will result in 46 damage, only 6 less than the classic hammer pant triangle. While having the bonus of 0.2s aditional stun and more possible angles.

Pop you're tornado afterwards, you might not hit them all ticks, but if you manage to hit at least one you can get another 21 damage nija shot off.

Even if you get only one tornado tick off this combo will do 83 damage, not bad considering you'll be level 4!


After this startup build lets find upgrades that synergyse well with the ninja worms. For now I found two contestors that work really well, Turbo Tape and Med-i'-can.

Turbo Tape, works well because since you have to shoot out of dash and tornado this will take you about a second more, you're also missing 0,8 seconds of stun. Tape allows you to make up for this lost time by still allowing you to get you're tornado hits in on a running enemy.

The absence of cubes means you will get poked a bit more, med-i'-can is way cheaper than the 350 solar cubes and helps two ease the pain those 1-2 auto attacks do, while still allowing you to stay on the field longer.
Light Pills while better than regen are just to expensive at the start.


After this I go for a combination of Ice cubes / health pills / Twisted Tweeters. I favor Tweeters since it works great with the Tape you already bought. You will need to priorities health if you're struggling or Cubes if you're team benefits more from it.

Build thornfish and piranha when you feel you can. The reason why I take piranha over mutant worms is that it will synergise better with your ninja shot. And you can still click shoot while chasing for maximum speed.

Buy RBay when you feel it's needed just like before.

My switch to full hydro is still a bit untested, I didn't reach that stage very often yet. My reasoning for the change is that you're dash angles are going to a lot different. you wont have to be in melee range after you're dash anymore, but ninja shot range instead. This allows the frog to move in during the ninja shot making triangle dash a luxury instead of necessary.

The one time I upgrades them was versus a Yuri and Vinny and it felt great. Yet like the old hydro smash, you'll still buy em really late game.


The only down side I see to Ninja worms until now is that it requires a lot more twitch skill, Froggy, Lonestar and Realyn players shouldn't have problems with it. I however can see people used to other characters and newer people struggling to get the shot off every time.




**Conclusion / TL;DR**

It is funny how very subtle changes and one new skill make my play style take a 180. Instead of a triangle dash into tornado Froggy I now play something I would like to call a hit'n chase froggy.
During the beta I only found out the patch it's effect on the classic frog, I did not have the time or enough serious games to come up with a new playstyle (there was a lot to test). Luckily the live patch provided that opportunity. I would like to know what you guys think of the new frog, how have you handled change.




**Footage**

I streamed a lot of footage about this build the past weekend, when I get around to highlighting them I'll link some interesting bits here. That will hopefully be tonight.

Hey guys!

This weekend, I will be hosting a couple of things.

Like when we reached 1000 members, I will be doing a 12-hour livestream get together, play together event. 
And then on Sunday, I will be hosting a Mini-tournament.

_______________________________________

**Saturday** (Mar. 2)

if you weren't there when we did this the first time, the 12 hour stream marathon is mostly a get together play together event where we try to play with each other in private lobbies and voice chat over at raidcall.

when we did it last time we were able to fill up a lobby and just played consistently for 12 hours straight. it was pretty fun but also pretty tiring.

**Raidcall group**

**Channel Name:** Redditnauts!

**Channel ID:** 5373265

**Download Raidcall here:** http://www.raidcall.com/v7/index.html

**Why Raidcall and not the pugrnauts server?**

- it's mainly so that we don't crowd the pugrnauts channel too much. I don't own the channel.

_________________________________

**Sunday** (Mar. 3)

for the mini tournament, this will be the first time i will be hosting one for awesomenauts. i have hosted tournies many times in the past but this is the first time for awesomenauts.

the purpose of hosting this mini tourney is to get some people to have some experience in participating in one so that when major tournies like the APL comes, they will be a bit more aware on what they should be doing.

i don't really expect many teams will join but if we get 2-4 teams sign up, that's okay. the entire reason for this is build up community activities. build a stronger community by getting to play with each other. And if you win, you'll be the first ever to become champions and you'll have bragging rights until we reach 3000 members.

**Format:** Single elimination

**To Register:**

Sign ups for the tournament will be happening two hours before the start so to those who does not have a team yet and would want to participate, i encourage you to drop by the meeting place and maybe there'll be others like you who are looking for teammates as well.

**Meetup Place:** Redditnauts Raidcall Channel

Signups start at **10am EST(7am PST) to 12nn PST(10am PST)**

Tournment starts around **12:30pm EST(9:30am PST)**

*I will put up another video to discuss the rules a little bit more. Expect this to come out by Friday.*

__________________________________________________

**Notes**

- There will be some giveaways as well so even if you're not interested in joining us, just drop by the stream for a few hours and maybe you'll win something. :)

&gt;The problem is not ""I can't raelynn in league 3"" it's ""I can't raelynn in league 3 the way I /want/ to raelynn in league 3""and still be able to play effectively.

I want to start a discussion on the meta as it relates to leagues and how it changes as you go up the skill curve.

I believe real teamwork and skill is when, assuming all the nauts in the game are the same level, you can still beat the enemy team (beat meaning win, not necessarily kill). And another level of skill exists in the ability to get and maintain a level advantage to give you an edge in those otherwise balanced fights.

I see a transition at around leauge 4/3 where the game goes from focusing on kills, gaining a solar advantage and snowballing to victory, to out-pushing and out-playing the opposing team. Then the meta really heats up at around the top 1000 with lots of other subtle factors coming into play, of which I'm less familiar than I would like ;)

I had a hard time convincing someone, who will remain unnamed, that even though they went 12/4 or something, we lost because they couldn't push and had only killed about 10 creeps (including health creeps).

So if anyone's interested, and **TL;DR**, I'd like to hear what you think of the meta-game, peoples objectives and playstyles and how they change moving up the leagues. 

Maybe this might even help somone progress to a higher leauge who were asking themselves ""I still play well, but i'm stuck. What am I missing?"" (including me at ~1200 rank)"	t5_2tvrv	True

Any tips for fighting? I find most of my damage comes from dynamites obviously, but any tips for using his shooter better? I feel there's so much potential there and I find I dont have enough output from his gun.

Even when matches are 3 v 3 premade teams can easily roll over teams that just wanted to jump into a match and have not played together before, unless you happen to get that 1 in 50 chance (these numbers are completely accurate according to the Completely True Facts Statistics) that you have chemistry with one or both of your teammates, which I have experienced a couple times.

As a clunk it is tough especially with upgraded diameter and situations of offense can quickly turn to defense if I am right next to Yuri and he activates the field. 

It becomes pretty much impossible to get out of the field especially if he has slow on the beam which usually doesn't kill on its own but hurts a lot. He can just get out of range of explode no problem because it extends detonation time when slow field activated. Usually at that time it is time for clunk to retreat because a lot like coitus once clunk does his romance explosion, he is done for a while. Retreat is difficult with slow beam after all that intercourse.

Add other enemy Awesomebros in the mix and it is deadly. Even worse add an Awesomebro with snare or stun and life gets about as tough as a neck beard complaining on the internet. Obviously Allies are important to lean on but I was wondering for a lone wolf scenario to get away?

Zimplicio	14	3	17	"Never seen this before, but the other day I played with a league one Raelynn that would literally dodge all the shots of the turret with jumps and clever movement while simultaneously shooting down the turret as blaster spec.

First thing she picked up was boots, and the map was Ribbit, if that matters.  Her ping was anywhere from 100-200.  

1.)  I've tried it myself and can't seem to replicate it.  Any tips?

1349491527.0	110y3y	The Gentlemen's Game, and Eight and out rules.	TerdVader	17	7	11	"The **Gentlemen's Game** is the term I began using when the players could easily win, but choose to prolong the game by attacking the other turrets even if they could go right to the base. It gives the opponents more time to regroup and change strategy if needed, and if the offensive team still tanks all the turrets and gets to the base, it's a deserved win.

1100 games in, I almost play the Gentlemen's Game exclusively. Not only do I feel it makes a more fair game, but at higher levels, allows me quicker kills of the enemies,upon confrontation, and solar bosses, adding to my prestige and round score.

My other unofficial rule, (and this is newer), is **Eight and Out** rule. Basically, if I go 0-8, or 5 and 13, it's time to quit. I've only had to do it twice so far, but the idea is that obviously when you trail by 8, you're either 1. not using the right build, 2. not as good as the other players, or 3. just suffering from bad luck. But either way, at -8, you're a detriment to the team, and even a bot can play better than that.

I implore you, if you're down by 8, please leave. You're not doing your team any favors by continuing. I'm not the guy who sends mean spirited messages to other players, ( lolz YOU SUCK NOOB) but at least once a day, I get angry and think to myself "" I sure wish so and so would just quit so I could have a chance at winning"". Awesomenauts is a team based game, and if you're not looking out for whats best for the team, you're not giving it all you've got. Even if that means quitting.

I don't think many people use these because I rarely see it but here are a few fun and powerful builds with some characters I've been messing around with.

Note: mostly for high level people

Lonestar: 

* [eagal bullets + tiger bullets + Crystal bullets = Fast speed at 13 damage per shot.](http://puu.sh/XuBz)

Derpl zork: 

* [Catsuit + ranged cat skill + bat catsuit = 20 damage per shot with long range.](http://puu.sh/XuFQ)

* [ Catsuit (or bat catsuit) + lots of cats + ranged skill (or the other catsuit passive) = 13 long ranged fast damage (faster than lonestars max speed blaster) or 20 short ranged fast damage.](http://puu.sh/XuDW)

* [Turret range + shield + other shield upgrade = massive protection for base defense.](http://puu.sh/XuG3)

clunk: 

* [Missile upgrade + juggernaut (I think that's what it's called) + Missile barrage = 14, 36, 44, 62 damage. About 156 damage per missile string.](http://puu.sh/XuCO) 

* I just fell in love with this combo [Bite damage + Extra HP on bit + Bite Damage Bulk buy = 54 damage and health on bite. I played a match with this and we won against a clunk and high-powered voltar, and high-damage yuri mine team.](http://puu.sh/XvMO)

* Quick n' cleaner (bite upgrade) + Power converter + The suckanator power 9000 cleaner (high level bite upgrade) = +88 Hp per bit dealing 44 damage. 

* Quick n' cleaner (or Suckanator power 9000 cleaner) + multi-hose + power converter = +128 HP per bite if you hit 2 targets, 64 if single target only dealing 32 damage each.

Yuri: 

* [Time warp heal + fast forward + heal pod delux = 24 health per second.](http://puu.sh/XuIV)

* [Range + crystal + Hubble lense = far damage of up to 9 per hit.](http://puu.sh/XuID)

* [Mine damage + cool down (or carpet bomb if you want to be a pain) + uranium spikes = 78 damage per mine (too lazy to divide by 3 for carpet bomb)](http://puu.sh/XuJ7) (sorry for this one, I was trying to get enough credits to buy the third passive but I deleted the picture that had it unlocked)

Froggy G:

* Golden Watch + Ice cubes + Golden Necklace =  2-3 second cool down for quick getaways

* (Previous combo above with the following whirlpool build) Fast forward + Bio fuel cell + Twister Tweeters = Extremly quick, long lasting, high damage dealing whirlpool charges.

That's all I've gone with and all except for the Yuri beam build worked wonders.

Edit: few more tips.

With some builds you have to skip out on some abilities. With Lonestar I avoid the TNT and only get the bull, with Derpl the abilities are optional but snare is recommended, for clunk you can skip on abilities also but vaccum bite would really help

1345127732.0	ybl52	The Ultimate Tactic - Hyperpush	krucifyd	11	0	8	"Hi there! I'm Teelap. Currently, I am rated around 1050 on the leaderboards on PC an i wanted to share my tactics with you fellow redditors. 

Currently, Awesomenauts is a broken, exploitable game, yet is rediculously fun! However, There is a tactic I have developed that is a true monster. I call it hyperpush. 

The best part about Hyperpush is that you can do it entirely yourself. So far, out of 65 games using this tactic, I have only lost 2 games. The plan goes like this:

Pick Voltar

Abilities: # of drones, explosion damage, CD; Kit health, improved heal, CD; Range, 10% solar/Heal, +4 heal; +30 solar/min, +150 solar, Free health.

The goal of this build is to win the game under ten minutes. When you land (if you caught enough solar) you can get all 3 bottom teir abilities and both of your regular abilities. get out to lane and heal away. When you have enough, buy the 10% solar/heal. Second time back get all the drone abilities. after that I priorities based on the game. If their team is pushy, get range and heal. If you are more pushy, get the health bot upgrades.

Usually, I am at least 5-7 levels ahead of the enemy. And it doesn't matter who you have on your team. Just heal the fuck out of them. If you gotta die to save a partner, do it. Just keep them on the field. every time the enemy is back at base. push like hell. When pushing, run into the enemy tower and take aggro. Then, drop your healbot and heal the fuck out of it. This will not only top off your minions, but it will also stop the enemy from effectively harassing your minions. Every time your drones are off CD use them. the explosions help push tower and with the CD upgrades they are a very effective weapon when being attacked (froggy G dashes thru them all the time and kills himself instantly). If you can keep up the pressure, you win. Never back off. In the 2 games i lost, my team backed off to secure the ""bonus"" towers. 

There is only one person that can threaten this tactic: CoCo. If I had 100 karma every time i say ""fucking goddamn COCO"" i would be the bill gates of reddit. Her ball is super effective against voltar. However i learned a trick to deal with her: Dodge the ball. It sound easy, right? Wrong! the hitbox on the ball is huge, but voltar has a secret tool to help him, his W ability. You can jump at max height and hover over the range of the ball.

Whelp, thats about all there is to this tactic. If you can get a Lonestar, Clunk, or derpl on your side, the game is an instant GG. If you wanna play and climb the board a bit, I am ""krucifyd"" on steam. "	t5_2tvrv	True

1336255630.0	t8w3y	CasualFriday11's Clunk guide!	CasualFriday11	11	0	10	"Hey, I know the game is fresh, and like most MobA games, everyone wants a guide on how to play a character. Right now I am playing a TON of Clunk, because he just doesn't care about what the other team wants to do.

Keep in mind: I am only level 19, so I do not have all of the loadouts. Also, I don't know the names of the loadouts at all =P So let's get to it!
___________________________________________________________

In my loadout, I have:

**BITE**

* Increased Bite damage and lifesteal
* Gain extra max HP when you lethally bite an enemy
* Ensnare an enemy when you bite them

**Self-Destruct**

* Increased Self-Destruct Dammage
* Slow enemies in the AOE while charging Self-Destruct
* Decreased Self-Destruct cooldown
(There is really no need to decrease the amount of dammage self-destruct does to you. It doesn't do much to begin with, and the amount of HP you end up with is absurd anyway)

**Missiles**

* Increased firing speed
* Add an improved missile to his stream
* ???? (I'll edit this when I get home, I can't remember)

**Stats**

* Increased Max HP
* Increased Movement speed
* Gain 125 Solar

The 125 Solar gain will probably be replaced with the other Increase Max HP skill when I unlock it. For now, this goes well with my strategy:


Start by collecting as much Solar as you can on the launch. On your first buy, I get my extra 125 solar, increased movement speed, and Bite. By the time you get to your lane, you should be level 3 against level 1 or 2 champs. The level advantage combined bite allows you to trade blows positively, giving you the upper hand in the first laning phase. Anyone who tries to be aggressive on you loses over half of their health. If you need to jungle, he can one shot all of the neutral creeps without an upgrade, giving you a distinct advantage in farm, as well as denying the other team any heals.

On my first buy, I'd like to get Self-Destruct, the aura that slows the other team when I am charging it, and increased max HP when you kill an enemy with bite. If you have enough Solar, increase your Max HP stat as well. (with the sustain from Bite and neutral camps, I might not go back until I have 700-1000 solar) 

When you are farming your max HP with bite, auto attack an enemy robot twice, then bite it. This guarantees that bite will be lethal. Basically, you have enough HP that you should never die, making sure you are the biggest and baddest tank in the game.

Your second buy should be all about increasing damage on your skills and becoming more tanky. If the other team is using heavy nukers, such as Lonestar maxing his dynamite, Froggy G maxing his nukes, or an enemy Clunk, max out your bonus HP before increasing damage on his skills. Here is why: against sustained damage enemies, Clunk can hang out all day. But burst damage can get the best of him, because you won't have the time to get more than one bite off. After taking a few heavy nukes, running away is difficult because you are probably the slowest champ in the game. Having all 3 points in Max HP will help remedy this. Even still, be weary of heavy nukes. 

If the other team is using auto attacks, such as Lonestar focusing his blaster or Leon, go ahead and increase the damage on bite and self-destruct with your second buy. You can just nuke these guys down while sustaining their damage through bite. You can get one point in increasing max HP if you want, that is personal preference. The bonus HP from farming with bite should be enough to tank these champs, but if not, go ahead and get a point or two in maxing your HP.
___________________________________________________________
**Your Role**

After your first buy, if you are tanky enough, just stay with another teammate and absorb all of the damage for them. (If this is after your second buy, there is no ""if"" =P )In fights, if you need to keep someone from running away, charge self-destruct, and then bite them right after it goes off. This will regen the HP you just spend to slow them and take out almost all of their health. In a 1v1 fight, feel free to bait them a little, then bite them. They will probably try to run now. Try to get another bite in before using self-destruct. If they are below 50% though, don't bother. Just self-destruct, keep them in the damage aura, and then taunt. =P

I didn't talk about missiles, and I forgot which upgrades I even use. I neglected them because, as you can tell from this guide, I focus on tanking and nuking the other team. Sure, I shoot missiles, but they are not the source of damage in this build. The way I see it, you have a ton of HP. You are better off running into the enemy team and nuking them. If you are standing back shooting missiles, you better have a good reason. I have yet to have a game go long enough that I needed to upgrade my missiles. I go for all of the other upgrades first.

HeIsMyPossum	15	5	24	"EDIT 1: I think it would be great to just heighten the bottom hallway a touch so at least small nauts could get out of there. It'd still be a great spot, but it wouldn't make it impossible to get out.

I've played a lot on this map, and Gnaw always dominates. He puts weedlings down there in such a way that it's impossible to kill them or chase him down. If he gets them set up (which is inevitable... I mean what are we going to do just camp down there the whole game?) The reason they're OP in my opinion is the combination of the following:

1) You have no idea how many are down there

2) They kill all droids and thus can solo push a lane unless you are babysitting it the entire game (and you can't push it either)

3) You can't go down to kill them, because they block the exits. If you go down, 1 character can enter the other side and then you're stuck and will die.

No one has the potential to burst them down if he gets 3 or more up in one of the sides. I don't think weedlings overall are OP, even though they're a bitch to deal with. I think they are balanced on the other maps, but this one particular map adds SO much to their effectiveness, I think it pushes it into OP range. If they're balanced normally, then this DEFINITELY gives them a huge boost."	t5_2tvrv	True

+10 dmg | Smoke Screen Size | +dmg | free pills

Very SD oriented build.

I start out with piggybank, pills, speed, and dive. I try to get any kills I can, and farm bots early game, until I can buy both basic dive damage upgrades. After buying them, I continue to kill and farm until I can get the other two dive upgrades. 

With spike dive maxed out, I'm dangerous. next I get smoke screen and -sd cooldown. This lets me spikedive-blind-spikedive which is super potent, since I can do 100 damage with my dive now. 

After that, I build into bubblegun for the rest of the game, and if it goes super late, I get smokescreen silence and size


Before anyone suggests Smoke Screen + Rubber Mask + Solar Burgers, I've tried that build and it was too slow for me (Didn't get sd damage early enough). If anyone has any suggestions on how to get that to work faster I'd be open to them though.

I'm starting to feel like I have a black mark on my character that no one wants to play with... I don't think I'm bad, I rarely die more than 5 times in an entire match and grab a few kills.

1360164981.0	1803o1	Playing your cards right - a Lonestar Guide	chikuu	12	1	10	"Hello guys!

This is my first concept of a guide, your feedback is appreciated!

I've been playing Awesomenauts for some months now (Steam's stating 100 hrs) and I wanna give you some insight on Lonestar - he's the only Naut I'm playing right now. I see many people struggling with Lonestar, so I want to give you a basic guideline.

In my opinion, my build doesn't have much weaknesses, but can maintain the upper hand throughout the game (if played patient).

**Upgrades we choose beforehand:**
**TNT:** Triple TNT, Bounce, Life Leech
**Bull:** +Health/Pushback, Explosion, +DMG (you can interchange +DMG for something else, its the last upgrade I get normally)
**Pistol:** +2 DMG/+4 DMG/AoE Bullets
**Basic:** Boots/Piggy Bank/Free Health

When the game starts, you have to get about 90% of the Solar from the dropping phase. Then get some solar in front of your base and go back. You should have enough to get the following with **Piggy Bank/Free Health**:
**TNT, Bull+Explosion**

This gives us great poking and pushing power. Gives us great defence too.

Make sure you get lots of creep kills, always keep the lane pushed away from the tower and poke at the other nauts with spammed bulls and long range Dynamite once in a while. Go to the jungle when creeps respawn, so you are at full health all the time and deny the jungle creeps. If you drop kind of low and the jungle isn't considered safe, go back.

If you reach 220 or even 440 before you have to go back the first time, get Triple TNT + Life Leech. Now you can stay in the lane forever and you are the greatest pusher in the game anyways. You still don't want to fight much with your pistol, keep it basic and don't take too much risk.

Once you take down the first/or both middle towers, you should get **the Boots Upgrade** ASAP. Triple Jump is very handy and you need them to save your ass regularly.

Get **TNT Bounce** next (or before boots, if you are still fighting for the first tower).

For the endgame you will need good Auto Attacks. Get **DMG, DMG, DMG** and top it with the **AoE bullets** (you can attack the base from the top and you don't have to aim that perfectly). Now you are basically finished (and the game too, probably). Keep pushing, pushing, pushing and again - don't take too many risks.

**Talking about matchups:**

**Froggy:** You can't kill a good Froggy, he is too mobile. Just keep dodging him and push him back with the Bull after Dash. Keep harassing him and maybe you'll get lucky hits with Dynamite on him (that actually hurt). Be aware that he can deflect all your stuff with the Tornado Upgrade (RBAY).

**Lonestar:** Just be the better Lonestar. Push more, dodge his TNT, hit with yours. Don't die. Simple as that.

**Leon:** Have your TNT ready. When he pulls you, throw them on his head. 60 DMG for free. Else/and: Bull him away.

**Clunk:** Space him well (you can even walk back and shoot him with Auto Attack). He has a big hitbox and no Range. Just keep him out.

**Yuri:** Your bull can clear mines. Will greatly decrease your pushing power, once you lose a lane. He is kind of a mismatch, but annoying as hell.

**Voltar:** You destroy Voltar. You one-hit creep waves and push his healbot away. You can also counter the ""Voltar-Train"" very well.

**Coco (Range):** She's a pain. You are the slowest Naut in game without boots. You can't really poke her well and she pushes the Creeps almost as good as you. Just keep pushing and jump the ganktrain, once she took a wrong step.

**Coco (Melee):** Don't fight with her. If you land Triple TNT, keep avoiding and try to kill her with the 2nd package. Else: Bull her away.

**Derpl:** A very good matchup. Exploding Bull + TNT is very annoying for Derpl - even regenerating or with Voltar in the back. 

**Gnaw:** Is annoying, but no good Naut in the end. You got lots of stuff to safely destroy plants (TNT almost oneshot, exploding Bull from afar). Just keep the jungle clean.

**Skolldir:** Hard matchup. You can't space him well because of his long range stun fist and throw (will be your despair actually). Play safe and throw lots of bulls into him.

**Raelynn:** You excel better than her in the pushing and fleeing department (thanks to the Bull). Once you got the Life Leech upgrade on your nades, you can take a snipe once in a while.

**Vinnie:** Vinnie doesn't like you, you don't like him. Try to pin him down with bull on the wall. Don't let him dance above you.

**Tips &amp; Tricks:**

**TK Bull (Tiger Knee Bull):** Tiger Knee is a fighting game term, when you do special moves just above ground. Jump and instantly press Bull. You gain more height and push back everything, including bots.

**Pin with the Bull/use your tower:** Drop down and throw an air bull, so you get fleeing jumpers (they ALWAYS jump!). Pin them to the tower, land your dynamite and it will be a sure kill.

**Bull DON'Ts:** Don't save your enemies with the bull (thrown, snared or pulled Nauts). So be aware, what your mates are gonna do!

**Triple Jump into Jungle on Sorona**: You can descent from the platform above the jump pad between the towers, then stick to the wall and triple jump to the Jungle. If you fail your timing, you can still get a bunch of Dynamites off and get the Health (if available).

**Don't die! (REALLY, don't!)**

I recently picked up Froggy G and absolutely LOVE him. 

So I've been trying to figure out how I build him. I'm currently seeing two ways to use SD/T.

My first and main build focuses on utilising the mobility of SD, using both Cooldown reducing abilities + Extended Stun duration, combined with buying most damage upgrades for my Tornado ( Shield, +Damage and Explosion.)

My second Build reverses the role of those two, using both +Damage upgrades and the one stage CDR Upgrade for SP and using Shield, reflect and MS buff on the Tornado.

1352512440.0	12y11m	Anyone else dislike the ranking system?	DMthePerson	11	3	17	"I understand that the ranking system is to punish players that ditch their team, but I feel like it's pretty harsh. I've been stuck on rank 6 forever, even if I get a great winning streak. Also, when I do level up to rank 5 and call it a day, the next time I boot up the game I'm mysteriously taken back to rank 6. What gives?

Another thing that annoys me about the ranking system is once I've been taken down to rank 7, and being that there isn't many players, it seemed like I always used to get thrown in matches with rank 9's and such who weren't skilled enough to contribute to the team. This made most matches for me impossible to win. 

I think it's pretty fair to admit this game isn't perfect balance-wise or match making-wise as of the moment, so leaving matches is something that shouldn't be looked at as wrongly. It's like the only way you can have fun in the game is when you don't leave matches, and if you do leave matches, you're stuck in a vicious cycle until you get lucky enough to break out of it by getting paired with decent teammates.

 Maybe I'm just over thinking it and I've been really unlucky as of lately, what do you guys think of the ranking system?

1336456118.0	tcj9f	Suicide Turret Dives All Game For Win. (anyone else seen this?)	b1gtym1n	10	0	5	"I was up against a leon who would rush the turret everytime and die purposely, but he was able to get off a lot of damage off on the turret and even with people we couldn't last hit him because he just kept jumping and the turret would kill him. He was pretty much pushing harder than my 2 other teammates. This is his choice, and he should be able to go 2-14 for a win if he wants, but I think this really takes away from the MOBA feel of using strategy and not blindly turret diving and dying purposely. At first I thought he was a troll or maybe a boost from my team, but he knew what he was doing and got 2 wins on me and probably many others doing that. I really like this game, but if one thing, I think the offense/defense scale should be more steep, as in, turrets will kill you in 3 bullets at level 1 because he wasn't even using creeps for cover or anything and being able to take down turrets pretty quickly that way. I'm not sure if any of you have seen this, or think this is an issue, it was just something you had to see to know how this could potentially ruin the fun of the game if we have thousands of people blindly turret diving to get a high win percentage and make leaderboard. He would jump over me to get to the turret and I would throw TNT and push him away and he didn't care whatsoever about being killed just to push and win and knew the turret had a way better chance to last hit him than I could, I think there should be an assist system implemented, to maybe balance the effect of fearlessly turret diving because if jumping it has the highest chance of last hitting. An assist system would boost the level of people playing as a team, I see it could get hectic, but maybe a 3-5 second assist timer, you had to hit within an amount of time of the kill to get the assist. I guess you could say this is a great strategy because it works, but I have a feeling it should be changed or re-worked so that this doesn't take over every game we enter. Thanks for reading.

Personally, I think that with increased start solar and FG price being cut in half it's going to be possible to ditch piggy bank and maybe even go for pills and medican later game, which would be really interesting.

So as a league 2 Rae here is my build on day one of the new patch:

TOP ROW
Height/dmg/slow or droid depending on team make-up

SECOND ROW
dmg/FG/range 

With it taking longer for me to aim up giving people more time to get away I've found being able to hit them farther away is much better then
getting more shots off with CD

THIRD ROW
piece/speed/ponytail

LAST ROW
So I decided to go for it and ditch piggy bank as an experiment, and I'm getting mixed, but (I think) more positive results than previously.
PILLS/MEDICAN/BOOTS

Order
Snipe - FG - Boots - pills x1 - pump x1 - range x1 - pumpx2 - medix1 - pumpx3 - rangex2 - pillsx2-3 - medix2 - piercing - rift - dmgx3 - heightx2 - slowx2 - ponytail - speed

It feels like half the time when I try to play solo I seem to end up replacing someone who has just rage-quit a losing match.

1371535824.0	1gkj4o	Ayla and Teamwork	chewy21tx	14	5	26	"Been playing for a few days since Ayla came out. Tried her out myself, and I was pretty impressed. Enjoy the animation and VO, and her skills, while they seemed pretty unique, didn't look too overpowered. So I tried her against the AI and did predictably mediocre, considering the AI finds crazy ways to escape death with just a sliver of HP remaining.

So I stuck with my Yuri main, and my brother his Voltar main. Since we run dual heals, any decent brawler or tank (or LS w/bull) can usually do well enough if they stick with us to win or at least make it a close game, since outhealing the enemy is pretty potent unless they can isolate us. A third steam friend joins us, and we work him into our team comp.

Now I had faced a few Aylas solo, rushing max dmg mines with toaster timer, and had done pretty well 1v1. I'm now convinced that every one of them were absolutely terrible.

Why?

Because as we roll along, my heal bubble up, Voltar's healbot up, here comes an Ayla. I'm not too scared, we could easily heal the damage she does, and we'll kill her before she drains us too much.

Wrong.

All she does is cover us with rage. And she goes from half HP to full in about a second and a half. Three enemy players, and she killed us all, leaving the fight with more HP than she entered it. This happened every single time. No amount of healing mattered, when she came in, we had to scatter. Then she'd just settle for one or two of us instead.

I understand that Ronimo were probably looking for counters to Team Nerf Plz after their APL steamroll, and if that's what she's built for, cool. Let her destroy teammates who stick together.

Thing is, she also destroys you 1v1. If you see an Ayla coming, you either run away or die. it really is that simple. Unless you've got insane burst that nearly one-shots her at full HP, you're not going to kill her. She leaches life too fast and does too much damage for that. And forget running if you've got any considerable distance to cover before getting to safety, she's too fast for most nauts to handle.

Granted, she doesn't have a lot of health. Regen kinda fixes that problem, though, by greatly extending the amount of time she can spend in rage without ever hitting anything. She enters the fight, stays, and leaves as she pleases. And the more enemies there are in that location, the better.

My observation is pretty simple: Awesomenauts has always rewarded good teamwork by allowing a team that's disciplined enough to stay together to overcome a stray nauts by sheer strength in numbers. This one new character changes all that. You can't do that anymore with her in the game. Your lone hope is to poke at her with range, which does very little to shift the meta as it stands. Raelynn, Coco, Lonestar, and the other ranged pokers have to peek out from around cover and take their shots where they can, ready to duck their heads back in at a moments notice. Brawlers have no chance. Yuri might get a mine kill if he takes advantage of her momentum and times it just right. but if that mine doesn't kill her, three more seconds of cooldown is all she needs to burn your HP bar down to zero.

How can teamwork exist as it has with the addition of a quick character whose favorite target is the entire enemy team at once?"	t5_2tvrv	True
1371475486.0	1giicj	How to not suck at this game?	randomjak	15	6	27	"Hey guys! I'm one of the many people who recently got Awesomenauts in the humble bundle - along with 2 of my housemates - and we've been having lots of fun playing on our own or as a pair / group of three. However, sometimes we get the feeling that maybe we just really suck, and we're not sure what is best to do about it?

I'm basically aware of the major principles of the game. Don't chase for kills unless you're 100% on them. Towers are the priority. Work as a team, etc - but I very rarely get a game where I don't get killed like 5 times (despite playing insanely defensively ) - and for some reason in all games after about 10 minutes all my team mates are level 20+ and I'm stuck around level 15 even if my KD ratio is positive and I've been killing creep at a decent rate.

What gives? Is there some secret formula we're missing here? Also everyone on the forums seems to think Ayla is ""the most balanced new naut yet"" which we find ridiculous. As a relatively new player she's completely game breaking with the life steal in bubble - but that's possibly just because I suck.

Anyways, I noticed i played pretty good as vinnie so i'm maining him atm.
I get 10+ kills most of the times and have a few deaths. 
This led me to believe that vinnie may be OP in these lower brackets of the matchmaking and it makes me feel bad for playing him after a while... But i enjoy playing him so much :)

So i just wanted to know, am I too good for the matchmaking I am currently getting or is the hero just extremely viable against new players (or OP in general) ?

Hey guys.
Over the past few days I have been thinking about things I can do to pass the time in a productive manner.
What I came up with is an idea for a fan video which I like to call ""Saving Private Raelynn"". While the name is taken from a popular war movie starring Tom Hanks, everything else is not, so don't expect it to be all that similar to the hollywood blockbuster.

I'm already done with the script and I'm going to start shooting and editing real soon. However, I will need your help with this, since I don't have a lot of RL friends who play the game.
I'll be posting updates on [this thread](http://www.awesomenauts.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;p=138541#p138541), but if you want to read all the little and most immediate news and updates about the project, keep an eye on my [twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/creepypies).

**How would you guys feel about having a visible character picking phase?**

The reason I would like to see a picking phase similar to how they do it in for example competitive Dota 2 games is simply because right now your choice of character is really just a matter of luck. If I pick Leon and end up fighting a Derpl, Yuri and Vinnie &amp; Spike, for example, I'm absolutely 100% f-ed, all else being equal.

The way I'd envision is that the teams simply take turns choosing their characters. Of course there would be some added complexity since late joining players would have a bit of an advantage, but then again, they've probably paid for that advantage by missing out on some solar.

my name is Ceranoa and I started playing AwesomeNauts about 2 weeks ago, and I really enjoy it so far.

But I have one question about the league system: As I started to play after some bot games, I fell down the leagues from league 4 really fast to league 9, which I considered as normal, especially because I only played random nauts (I want to get basic experience with all of them).

But then after about 25 games, I managed it to rise surprisingly fast, while still playing only random heros, which ended with me in league 2 after not more then 60 games and only level 40-50, in which I stayed the rest of the season (only a few days), ending with 71 games and in league 2.

Now my question is, is it supposed to work that way? I mean, I played other MOBAs and it took me *ages* to reach a decent skilllevel. And right now I played the game 20 hours and I'm nearly at the top (?).

I'm also considering bringing on fellow commentators and community members to discuss updates and such, as listening to a single opinion gets kinda stale.

1351813789.0	12hipw	Quick overview of the new naut'	thatdovahkiinyouknow	10	2	7	"top edit: screw it, ***THIS IS LONG AS HELL!***

First off, I love this person. The voice is awesome, the design is awesome, the dialogue and passives are full of references like ""you feeling lucky punk"", ""I'm firin my lazer"" (or chargin either one), and ""Say hello to my little friend"". Going based on this person alone I can't wait to see what ronimo will do the the next naut.

First, ***her pistol*** has a ***similar range to lonestars blaster*** but ***does 8 damage*** and shoots at a slightly faster pace putting her at the advantage of for any early 1v1 lonestar duel. This blaster can be upgraded to deal 18 to players and 14 to droids and creeps. That very same pistol can be given a piercing shot as well as extra range putting them at even more of an advantage when a massive wave of bots come either from a late game group or some voltar or lonestar kept on pushing them back and let the bunch up.

The snipe is really good (to some degree OP near end game) and fun to use but here is how it works: you press the button and your character pulls out a spartan laser and ***can't move, jump or cancel the attack*** and a laser pointer pops up letting you know the direction of the attack and if you see ***a cross-hair over an enemy that means you will hit it***, once charged the gun will automatically fire itself after several seconds of charging BUT if you ***spam LMB you can fire it the moment you hear a beep***, normally you hear the beep and it fires half a second later. Once fired you will see a picture of a cross-hair with the word hit next to it to show you hit something just in case you are playing on a small resolution or monitor. ***It can't go through or damage turrets either.***

The time warp (which I deem as completely OP once upgraded) is a small field that can be placed down to ***slow enemies by*** a lot, about ***50%*** IIRC and it lasts for quite some time. The cool down is really short by default and by the time one field is down you have to wait 1 second to place another and with the duration skill you can have 2 fields down at a time due to the long duration. This field can also be augmented to damage people similar to voltars healbot passive (but it's attack rate is insanely high) and it can be upgraded to deal up to 3 damage per tick. It can also spawn 2 bots for everytime they are placed as well as be changed to last longer or stand taller. It does not appear to be able to be destroyed as of yet and has a really short throw distance.

Like some characters she also has a ***special speed boot passive*** which not only increases speed but ***if you don't shoot*** (doesn't matter if you're under attack) ***you gain even more speed*** and enter a sprinting stance which can be shown with particles entering your character and a line of arrows facing the direction you are facing above your head.

My current build can be started from the very start of the game and can greatly effect your end game passives.

For the bottom row I have Health, Speed, and the free health buff

For the middle row I have piercing, extra cash on kill (not sure if it applies only to the pistol), and extra range.

On the 2^nd to top row for sniper I get damage, extra cash on hit, and even more damage to maximize solar gain.

On to top row I choose Adding damage to the time field, spawning drones, and double damage to 1 shot when fired through the field (does not work for the snipe so don't even think you can deal 130 damage with it)

With this build you can easily get money just by standing behind your turret and sniping things, near the middle of the game I was able to get 70 solar from 1 shot because of a voltar, his bots, a leon, a froggy G, and 5 droids coming down in 1 straight path.

That's all I have on the new naut' so far, let me know what else you find.

Bottom edit: I forgot to mention the starting damage for the Sniper. At the start it deals 30 damage and can be upgraded (2 upgrades increase damage one increasing by 7, 3 times and another increasing by 14 once.) to deal a maximum of 65 damage. It can also be changed to have less cool down or even..... blind..... This thing has a MASSIVE instant hitting range, adding blind isn't exactly a good idea on ronimos part IMO.

Also, I added some zelda style bolding in case you don't want to read all that and want to discover the character on your own.

Instead of jumping up properly from the moving platform, the character will trigger the float animation without gaining any altitude.

I often get 10-15 kills per game and very few deaths. However, I can probably count on one hand the number of games I've won where there was a Skolldir on the enemy team. It just seems like his stunlocking is too powerful to deal with as a melee hero.

If I have a teammate that can stun him for a while, I can usually burst him down, but that's not reliable unless I'm in a premade team (which I'm not).

So my question is: **How do you deal with Skolldir when you're solo-queuing?** Right now, all I can really do is try to stay away from him and push where he's not, but in Aguillon's tight corridors I'm basically dead if he gets anywhere near me, and if he's pushing a turret, there's no way I can defend."	t5_2tvrv	True

No one ever complained about then then.. So why is it happening now? I don't get it.. You can quite easily out run the missiles as they are slow. Also the better route to go on Lonestar's blaster is dmg, dmg, attack speed in my opinion. It shoots out 3 or 4 13 dmg shots in the time that one missiles would hit. Anyway, if any of you still think that Lonestar is  OP, let me know. Im interested to hear what other people think of the situation :) 	t5_2tvrv	True

More players joined in, game slowly continued, until we had added a red Genji, a blue Genji, and a blue Raelynn. Last remaining bot was a blue Froggy G.

Now, things up to this point were normal.

Then, a red Coco joined the match. My scoreboard showed myself, Coco, and Lonestar, and the blue Genji/Raelynn. For some reason the bot was gone. I assumed our Genji had left the match. Suddenly, I pass by our Genji, just as he says in chat ""4 on red?""

Then we discovered the blue Genji was invisible. There were some aura effects, name/attacks were visible, but the 'naut was invisible. At some point he became visible again like normal, and my Derpl became invisible (so I was three glowy orbs moving around, until I switched to siege mode and somehow came back).

We continued the match like normal, with a messed up scoreboard and 4 reds vs 3 blues.

Match ended, red won, everyone said something to the effect of ""gg, I guess"", and that was that.

Anyone else seen a glitch like this? Anyone else, like myself, start to get curious what a 4v4 or 5v5 map might look like? (my own connection would probably cry from the lag that would give me, but I have to admit I'd love to see the chaos firsthand)"	t5_2tvrv	True

1360367711.0	185w21	What just happened?	DMthePerson	10	1	9	So I've  been at league 6 for a while and then comes the update where they expand the leagues, which knocks me up to 4. I manage to win a couple of games after that without losing any of them and all is good. A little less than a week later I come on (which is today) and find that I dropped to rank 5. I wasn't really that surprised since the ranking system moves around a lot on its own, and I could probably easily rank back up. As soon as I join a game I get disconnected nearly instantly, but before I reconnect I notice that for some reason, I got moved down all the way to rank 8. How and why did this happen? It didn't even rank me up at all after I won a game.	t5_2tvrv	True

So I was thinking, why not poison? It would Remove the overpowered double shot and lower max damage from 80 to 40, and replace with a scary damage over time that (hopefully) won't stack with other poisons from other weedlings, Weakening gnaw to a state closer to balance."	t5_2tvrv	True

Like so many others, I just got the game during the Fall steam sale and I fell in love. I'm sitting at league 2 and rank 4165 on the Leaderboards, after just a few short weeks... but I do still have some criticisms/questions for you more experienced Redditnauts.

Let me start by saying my main nauts are Leon and Derpl with bit of Gnaw and Yuri on the side. I'm going to tell you guys how I build them and I'd love some criticism.

With leon, I got piggy bank, tongue, tongue range, stealth, crit, health, movement as my base upgrades. In mid game, I focus on attackspeed, backstab, and first strike dmg. and finally for late game I get the clone attack and explode for pushing.

I play leon as a straight up assassin. stealth behind people and stick to them dishing out as much dmg as possible. or I might tongue people into my team/turret and then follow them. i feel like I dont farm enough on him because I focus on killing enemies too much, but he jsut does so much dmg I cant resist.

With Derpl, I get free health, piggy bank, turret, turret range, turret stun, nuke, health as my core. I then go into mid game with turret damage, and nuke upgrades. At the very end, i get snare duration and cat upgrades.

With Derpl, I almost paly opposite of my Leona. PUSH PUSH PUSH all day. I outrange turrets every chance I get and keep pushing even if it means me dying many times. I can duel very well with derpl with snare, stun, and nuke, but I am usually overextended because I push too hard and go 1v3 and die.

Like I said, I'd love any and all criticisms, and maybe good build for Gnaw and Yuri as I""m not as sure on them.

Now for the questions.

* 1. How hard/realistic is it for me to try to get to league 1? 
* 2. Is it worth it to prestige? I""m just about to hit max level.
* 3. It is good to suicide to push turrets?
* 4. Is there anyway to see my total W/L?
* 5. What are considered the OP/UP champs by most?
* 6. How often do they patch/add new nauts? 
* 6b. When do you guys think the new naut will be released.
* 7. How much rating do you get for winning/losing/d-cing?
* 8. Not much of a question, but feel free to add me. my steam name is sethers656 and I would love to play with more experience players."	t5_2tvrv	True

Yeah, there were the early OP issues, but that was resolved fairly quickly. Now, its turned back into OP, but it isn't the same reason. Now, its stun stun stun. If your character can't stun, you are going to have a bad time. Derpl's stun is probably the most stupid change they made. Hey, get stunned back to back and die and there's nothing you can do about it. Skol's stuns is slightly more manageable, but its range is way to long. His stun hit just shouldn't be that far. It they made it normal melee range I think that issued would be pretty much resolved. Derpl's just needs to be replaced with something else.

Edit: I've been thinking a little more, and I think the problem stems from them trying to release too many characters too fast. They don't have time to really think about a character and its skills. They just kind of throw things on a character. ""Oh, it needs a couple upgrades still, just throw a stun in there."""	t5_2tvrv	True

I'm doing my best to avoid death but I don't have clever builds in mind, I'm guessing about teamwork and where I should be at any given time...I'm not very good.  

So it drives me up the wall that the only option I have is to play against the same team of dudes that whipped my ass last time.  I can't quit and join another game, I've been dropped into the same game 100% of the time.  I've played around 10 games at this point, and lost every one of them.  I have no reason to believe that playing more games will help me any, because I'm not getting matched up against people at my skill level, I'm getting matched up with people that are ending the game about 10 levels higher than I am.  

Fine, I get it, I'm missing something, I'm not good, but the game isn't teaching me how to get better, and it's not giving me the option to play against people that are as bad as I am.  I'm presented with the monumental task of doing hours of research outside the game just so that I have a chance to enjoy Awesomenauts, because I can promise you that failing against the same team over and over again isn't going to bring new players, like me, into this genre.  

Maybe I've missed the point.  Maybe this game doesn't want me around. Fine, I guess I'm sorry I gave this game a shot.  But I wanted to try something new and different, and if the only thing that this game, or this genre, knows how to do with people like me is to make us loose repeatedly until we either decide to become power players ourselves, or quit in disgust, then I can't seem much of a future for this game.

So i made this mock up with 3 check boxes for battle and 2 for private. they are as follows:

O: Open, exactly what we have now

P: Private, no one can join you ever without an invite (in the case of battle, people could still join you normally through quick match or battle, just like any regular game)

PO: Private-Open, This is for battle only, this lets the main battle screen (where you set up your team of 2-3) be invite only, but once you join a game, anyone can join you through the join button in the steam overlay.

And here is the mock up i made

This full (non-rage) rant is just a way to ask:  Just once, does anyone wanna queue up that plays Derpl and isn't a poor tactician?  It seems like most Derpl players are just...  Unaware.  This is definitely not the first time a Derpl has done this either, every time I get a Derpl on pickups I just sigh and try to pick up their slack.  "	t5_2tvrv	True
1373450730.0	1hzz1f	Mega farm leon build	hokahoka	11	2	19	"Been working with this build lately, and here's the gist of it:

start:
piggy bank, tongue, tongue farm, tongue range

next pickup level 1+2 regen, then purchase the slow AA modifier.  After that, grab boots, get invis.

The key to the build is getting invis regen (pinot noir?) next, and then max slow, get level 1+2 backstab, get his +2 damage (or attack speed, your call) maxed out, and finish with tongue, drone HP and drone walk or explode.

The power of 'triple' regen is absurd; you can stay in the lanes all game long, and by doing so you can use tongue every time it comes off of cooldown for an EASY 20 solar minimum every time you tongue a creep wave.  If you're good, you can grab a hero and sometimes 3 flying drones for a massive solar pickup.  Late game, you will swing for 22 damage on each backstab, and the slow means nobody's getting away.

I've only been working with it for a few days, but man is it lethal.  Nobody respects the slow, and if you can position yourself to avoid massive bursts (snipe, explode, derpl nuke) you won't miss the max hp difference.  You will wreck just about any hero 1v1 lategame as well.  If you're low, pop invis, juke, and be ready to fight again in seconds.  I was a solar tree + power pills guy ever since the game came out; I have totally converted to the power of regen."	t5_2tvrv	True

1372782102.0	1hi6ep	Best match I ever had last night	Afakaz	12	4	16	"My roommate and I frequently play split-screen AN with me on a controller, and we mostly don't play online because of the inherent less-ness of that setup, but last night we went out for a league 5 match.

When we hit ready, we saw that we were in a game with 5 people already, waiting for the host.  That screamed premade to me, or at least rematch team, but we always play games through so we decided to get what we could out of it.

I went Skolldir (yes, I know it's terrible on a controller, he's still one of my best characters), my roommate went Raelynn, and our third teammate was apparently a Coco, I think.  We were matched against Gnaw, Coco, and Vinnie.  The map was AIS 404.

Early on, it seemed completely hopeless. Our teammate raged as soon as he died once (which he did quickly, given that Coco and Vinnie were sticking together, patrolling the jungle frequently, and dual-bursting anyone they came across), and several other people joined and raged as soon as they got beaten once.  The enemy team wasn't pushing very hard, but Gnaw had +seedlings and fertilizer, and had set up a full suite of seedlings right in front of their one turret.  I didn't go for gnome right away so I didn't have a lot of AoE, so for quite a while that turrret was impenetrable, with the Gnaw sticking just behind it and spitting on anyone who came near, and while we were able to mostly keep them back from our turret, they gradually chipped away at it.  We hadn't had a chance to touch their turret at all when they destroyed ours.

They kept pushing and we had some great fights in the mid area where the lanes split; I kept going around the bottom and tossing Coco or Gnaw into our turret, a lot of kills made all around but mostly on us.  I was getting kills but I still felt like I was feeding.

Then we got a teammate who didn't leave; he was playing Lonestar, and he wasn't great, but just having a steady teammate with some push was very helpful.  Right before they broke our top turret, Rae and I were able to drop from the jungle and completely clear out the weedling nest with earthquake + snipe + gnome + some more auto-attacking (nerf Gnaw plx) and get in a light push on their turret.  They pushed us back and took our second turret, so they were in our base with their front turret still over 50%.

I didn't notice when it happened but they lost their Vinnie somewhere between our first and second turrets going down.  We pushed successfully and they stopped hitting our base to defend their turret.  They lost their Coco around when their turret went down, and we continued the push.  They continued to periodically rally, and our fights in this time were everywhere between their top turret, the jungle, the middle area, and our base.  Gnaw was an obnoxious bitch, like Gnaw is, but by sticking with Rae we were able to pretty solidly brutalize him with snare + slow + bronze + snipe.  Once Rae's time warp was fully upgraded they stopped being able to get into our base.

I expected a base race once we got their top turret, but once we were in their drill, they mostly tried to play defense, but with the exception of a Clunk who stuck around for a while, they were squishy enough that we could burst them down pretty easily.  And Clunk was slow enough that we could toss, CC, slow, and burst him down before he could escape the time warp.  Gnaw had some seedlings on the turret which were annoying, but we were able to hunt him down and kill him.

The game was about 28 minutes, at the end, I was 8/8 and Rae was 7/6, but we managed to go from a situation we thought was certain defeat to a fairly broad win.  Props to the Gnaw who stuck around even when both of his teammates either raged or d/c'ed, and who kept harassing us for the entire half hour.

No screenie but I thought I'd share the story with Reddit."	t5_2tvrv	True
1372683413.0	1hf906	Lack of matchmaking	rdzzl	9	3	15	"So I've been playing Awesomenauts on and off since release. I initially fell in love with the game and played a lot. League 1 and stuff. Didn't notice much of an imbalance in terms of teams because I rose right to the top and played against and with good players. After a couple months off, I recently picked up the game again and this is getting silly. I get matched with a bot and a league 5 player against full prestige people on the first page of the leaderboard every other game. It is not fun at all to get dominated that hard over and over.

How come there isnt a matchmaking system? Perhaps league 4 players get up against league 3,4,5 etc. It would balance the game a lot more.

Another feature I would like to see, is the ability to pick the map you want to queue for. I hate the ""short"" map. All the other ones are fun to me, but the short one is boring. How come I can X it out that I don't want to play it?

---Best:
Ayla: amazing speed, her bubble wrecks many chars after you get both dmg upgrades, her evil eye ability is also really powerful hard to counter for many chars.

Lonestar: can win games on his own by pushing so hard that he might shit himself during the process.

Raelynn: really powerful pusher too, really annoying blind ability gets tons of cash due to oneshotting multiple creeps, the rift is really powerful lategame.

---Good:
Vinnie: due to him being really weak early game he is just on the good list, mid/lategame he can get tons of kills and the teamcloak is nice too.

Clunk: after they fix his medical pump he belongs on the Best, but in his current form lacking the 90 hp he should have more he is only good. 

Leon: he is just good he can get many kills but if the other team sticks together he can't do much.

Skolldir: His throw in combination with his stunning and dot damage makes him really annoying to deal with. 

---Okay:
Coco: her ball ability seems to work very well in laggy games but if it is not laggy she shouldn't get many kills, being rather a nuisance than a threat.

Yuri: You gotta be really lame to play Yuri well and you are often times dependant on your opponents being bad or falling for your trap. Good players don't fall for his traps he is often times doing his thing while it is 3 vs his other 2 allies.

Gnaw: Overpowered on Ribbit, not so good on the other maps.

Genji: has to be very passive in most games, the only real contribution to the team seems to be cocooning.

Froggy G: worse than ayla or leon, while having the same role.

---Crap: 
Derpl: Can't contribute much to a game, often times the game becomes a 2v3 with the derpl sitting somewhere being derpl and having a good time not doing anything.

Voltar: He can get tons of cash by healing to buy nothing powerful with all the solar."	t5_2tvrv	True

1368214666.0	1e35al	Leon's Clover of Honor is better than Backstab in some cases.	Insanitybeat	13	6	12	"I have been using a Clone spam Leon technique lately, testing out if Battery Pack or Explosion is better. I still don't know and may never know.

But, while I was testing it, I took off Backstab and put on the Clover of Honor just to see the difference it makes. It turns out, Clover of Honor does damage to turrets, but it is not full damage. I did not upgrade my basic attack, but I did upgrade the Clover of Honor all the way, making it do +12 damage on my third strike. Dummies have been nerfed so they do half damage against EVERYTHING now.

The Clover of Honor does 6 damage on the dummies against turrets and the base. On Leon himself, without upgrading any damage except the Clover, he does 11, which is 3 more than usual. Keep in mind it does 20 against people.

Also, with Clover of Honor, you can hit some droids twice and then save your Third hit for later, similar to Raelynn's HC Bomb.

Now, paired with Battery Pack and Clover of Honor on the dummies, they do potentially more damage than without the Clover of Honor against turrets and the base.

Leon's dummies with explosion on them does 1/5 of the damage to turrets and the base. They really hate Explosion spam, I guess, and they don't have that additional +40 health and cannot get in the few extra hits, which makes Clover + Battery Pack the only effective setup to use on the Dummies. Backstab on Dummies is very ineffective, seeing as how they cannot jump behind people, and if they do get behind someone, it is a very rare once-in-a-game occurrence.

Dummies are not for killing people. They are for distracting. They are for annoying. They are for tanking. Explosion is good against infantry, seeing as how it has a blast radius, and it very effective against other melee characters (Gnaw) and droids as well as Weedlings, but the Battery Pack allows for tanking ability and more hits if you are following behind it.

**TL:DR** Well, I have no idea what the conclusion of this wall of text is, but my point is, Clover of Honor damages turrets, while Backstab does not."	t5_2tvrv	True

1366691245.0	1cwzs5	So, whatever happened to balance hotfixes?	binarian	10	3	11	"So, this was posted by Olivier (one of the Ronimo staff) immediately before 1.17 went live (emphasis added):

&gt; Some key contacts for us at Valve are taking a holiday starting tomorrow, meaning that we had to launch the patch today OR have to wait 2 weeks before we can launch the new map. We found this out today and we chose the first option.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course this isn't an optimal situation as we wanted to keep beta testing for a bit longer before putting stuff in the main build. There's some small issues with the build and **we do plan to do a *balance*/bug hotfix soon** (we CAN do hotfixes without Valve after releasing this patch, fortunately).

Before, this upgrade would simply decrease the cooldown of Spike Dive whenever Smokescreen was used. When it was first released, it was extremely amazing, allowing an instant second attack. However, after the next patch, it simply turned into a reduced cooldown by 3 seconds. Now, it has a completely new ability: gain 2 solar per second for every enemy inside.

This completely changes the dynamic of this naut because now they can potentially have the fastest leveling in any given battle and extremely powerful attacks. The trick is to trap as many opponents and enemy droids in the fog, and you'll be rolling in solar and kills. So here's my build:

**Spike Dive**: Dead Seahorse head, Bag Full of Goldfish, Chrome file

**Bubble Gun**: Sharky&amp;Ramona/Yakoiza, Al Carper, Loanshark

**Inflate**: Solar Krab Burgers, Boots, Free Power Pills


* Quickly get a lot of solar during the drop and grab Power Pills, Krab Burgers, and Spike Dive
* Spend early game farming and kiting enemies until you have enough to grab Smokescreen and Rubber Mask (330 solar)
* Use Smokescreen in large groups of opponents, then quickly Spike Dive away to safety. Rinse and repeat, then watch your Solar rise very quickly. Purchase Rocketeer for a greater effect.
* Purchase Boots for better mobility
* Grab an upgrade of Presidential Mask, then focus on either Spike Dive or Bubble Gun upgrades. Spike Dive allows you to deal a great amount of damage. Bubble Gun allows you to safely snipe enemies with a piercing attack (If you go the Bubble Gun route, I would recommend using Shark&amp;Ramora simply because it's safer, but Yakoiza is also viable to grab that extra damage if you have good aim)
* Whichever route you choose, make sure to grab Loanshark to get even more Solar

**#2 LOLOL IM NOT PAYIN 4 DAT LOL**

*Awesome! Registration is free. There are perks allotted for those individuals that would like to support something like this happening again. The prize pool will not be affected negatively by any number of free/paid/or sponsored reigstrations. (If anything, it will increase.)*

**#3 LOLOL WILDCARDS BROKEN OPP PLEASE NERFF LOL**

*The quirky rule set and game play changes imposed by the wild card system is an attempt to motivate strong teams to get stronger by trying and winning with new things and different limitations. The mechanics are still in the works, and we are completely open to taking advice and direction from senior and recognized members of this community to come up with something that is different, fun to play, and still competitive.*

I haven't tried PUGrnauts yet but I would assume that it's for the more higher ranked players that are good at the game. I consider myself fairly new and would love to play with others who are still fairly new (not brand new, at least 10-15 matches of practicing beforehand) so we can learn together!

Alternatively, if anyone would like to privately teach me how to play a good Leon, I'd be more than glad to take up on your offer!

I'm testing out this new segment i'm calling ""Awesomenauts Vs"" where 6 players from league 1 and 2 set up a private lobby to duke it out in a best of 3 format.


**Game 1:**

**Game 2:**

**Game 3:** ( i dunno. is there one? :D)


The casting is ""Tournament Style"". With us not having a spectator mode yet, I try to utilize the minimap when possible. I also edit out parts where i am dead or buying stuff to lessen the downtime.

The overlays are still just for experiment. If people are interested in seeing more of this type of gameplay, I will put more time into making better overlays.

As always, I am very open to suggestions and feedback. Also, is this something you want to watch more of?

Thanks! Enjoi!

AFAIK, people tend to go for the lifesteal Clunk with the vacuum bite.  However, I like to use the explode ability as much as I can and just tear through people before they get a chance to hurt me much.  Just so you know, I don't actually know the names of any of the items so I'm just gonna describe them as I see fit.  If anyone wants to give me the names of items 

1. Immediately after spawn buy the increased solar generation item, the +150 solar item, and the explode ability.  Most people will go for the bite first, but fuck that.  You wanna explode.  Plus, you can catch weaker enemies like Yuri and Leon off guard with a big 60 damage hit right as the match starts and get an early kill.

2. Whenever you feel like going back, buy the bite.  By this point the enemies will have gotten wise to your exploding ways and be looking to counterattack.  If you can afford it, get the bite increases max health upgrade (lv1) here too.  Go farming those little creeps to get your max HP up.

3.  Start pimping the hell out of your explode.  I usually max the damage first, then I buy +movement speed and ensnaring bite.  After that, I go for decrease cooldown for explode and decrease charge time for explode.  Nothing says KABOOM like 100 damage that the enemy can't escape from.

4.  Buy the second max health upgrade now.  Then I start to pimp my missile string.  Maxing out the cooldown/missile speed is the first thing you need to do.  Then add homing and finally more powerful missiles.

That's pretty much it.  I've had games where I've gone 10/0 with this build, and games where I go 6/3.  However, I've never had a negative K/D spread.  Feel free to add your input, I'd love some feedback on this.  I'd also love to see if it holds up in the current PC version, so if any of you have a youtube channel and like Clunk, try this out and send me the video."	t5_2tvrv	True

But i will change that a bit. Now, i wanna see if we can assemble making multiple private matches with full lobbies all at the same time.

it's gonna be hard and it would be awesome if you can join us!

**Where to meetup:**

The entire thing will be streamed. It will be at:

www.twitch.tv/wawasc

We can use the stream chat to set up matches, look for players or open lobbies, etc. 

I am aware that there is a mumble server for us but i don't know how to use that. :(

if you do. im sure tons are over there all the time playing this game so finding a private match would be easy. 
We will start around 6pm EST - 10pm EST **/** 3pm PST - 7pm PST.


**What can this do to us and the community:**

- forming a possible solid team
- maybe a  tourney (?) ;)
- have fun
- fun
- having fun

I hope to see a lot join in!

Thank you!

Just picked up the game yesterday. At first i was getting hammered (as to be expected). I realised that a big part of the reason this was happening was because I was much lower level than my enemies.

Coming from a LoL background, I figured I should start killing neutral creeps or minions to claw my way up the levels. It seemed to work, however it's really hard to know how much effect its actually making.

So my question is.... Is there any way to know how much XP your character has in game? I couldn't see an XP bar anywhere. Does anyone know the actual numbers that creeps and minions give when killed?

TL;DR
1. Is there a way to see how much XP your character has in game?

I keep seeing people recommend Solar Tree but I'm not sure whether it's because they haven't done the math or if there's something I'm missing.

Solar Tree costs 125 solar and gives 30 solar/minute. It pays for itself after basically 4 minutes. Piggy Bank gives a flat 150 solar. If you take ST instead of PB then you need to make up 275 solar with ST before it starts making profit. This takes about 9 minutes, but then it will take another 5 or 6 minutes before ST pays for an extra item on its own. By then it's been about 15 minutes, which against heavy pushing teams probably means you've either lost or are well on your way to losing.

The only two times I could imagine taking ST are if you are confident you can drag a game out to 20+ minutes or if you are playing an expensive character who needs the solar more than movement speed or extra health. I suppose if you're playing a character who can't farm or kill effectively (coco?) then ST might be worth grabbing, but health or movement speed is a pretty significant sacrifice for that.

I've always favored support roles in online games, so I quickly realized I love Voltar! My question to all the other Voltars is this:

**What is your drone build?**

As we all know, Voltar relies mainly on his drones for damage output, so the build on a player's suicide drones usually plays a big part in his/her playstyle. So here's my drone build:

* Dark Matter Shots

* Hyper Drive

* Warpgate Overdrive

Rather than focus on sheer damage output, I prefer to have a rapid stream of blindness taken to the enemy, as I find it easier for the team to get kills that way. I may not get many kills myself, but that build tends to cause quite a bit of chaos on the enemy team. So what are your drone builds, or do you have any criticisms for mine?"	t5_2tvrv	True

Ever die after a great win streak and get to enjoy watching a countdown until you could play again? Maybe you alt-tab out to check what's going on your favorite subreddit... I'd bet watching how your team holds against the enemy push would make that not feel like such a waste of time.

Also, Spiritual Cooking is the upgrade for Monarch Blessing where it raises the max health of your allies. Does it raise their health for just as long as the blessing or do they keep the max health buff?

And the Misfortune Cookie for the cocoon, does it reduce the max health of the target until they die or do they get the health back? And does the max health reduction stack? (So if you hit them twice with a level 2 Misfortune Cookie, does it reduce their health 60%?)"	t5_2tvrv	True

2. The wait time for queues is now infinite; meaning that the game will wait indefinitely until a full party of 6 players is in the queue. 
3. ~~To compensate for #2, a true ""Quick-match"" option will be available.~~ To compensate, there will be an option to veto the timer.
4. ~~Upon leaving a match, you will be given a 10-second timer which allows you to rejoin, supposedly without a penalty. (Not sure if you have to use the same character.)~~ Upon *attempting* to leave a match, the game will prevent you from doing so using a small timer. After the timer is up, then you are allowed to leave. (This is supposed to be implemented in patch 1.22)"	t5_2tvrv	True
1375299317.0	1jfwvy	Awesomenauts Arena? [Suggestion]	Emmsii	11	6	16	"This is only a suggestion but what do people think of Awesomenauts having an arena/free-for-all/team deathmatch mode. No towers, no bases, no droids, no bots. Just straight up PvP. 

I know its straying off the theme of Awesomenauts (MOBA, lanes, etc), but it could be a fun way of having fights against other players and friends to see who's the best Leon or Gnaw; for example.

Just a thought, feel free to rip the shreds out of it."	t5_2tvrv	True

I just started playing a few days ago (league 4 yay!) and I've been playing Clunk almost exclusively. It doesn't seem like most people play only one naut but how many do they use? Four? Five? All of them? I'm curious to know how many different nauts people play regularly, and if they're diverse or similar."	t5_2tvrv	True

I'm totally digging the removal of slower movement when healing though!"	t5_2tvrv	True

It shouldn't even be possible to be paired up against players who have ten or twenty times more in game time than you.

O_o	steele578	12	8	3	"So I was filtering through the settings of Awesomenauts, because I started it up and realized I didn't have time to play, so I was just looking at my settings, and I accidentally hit tutorial. I just went with it, and was going to see how fast I could beat it. So I killed all the critters to heal and lift the quarantine, and I went to buy the dynamite, but I noticed the weirdest thing underneath it. The 'ROTFLNauts"" upgrade. I bought that instead, and my game exited, and I was put into  new game; rotflnauts. I couldn't figure out what I was doing, I was pressing random keys to figure it out, and when I hit escape, that game exited as well, and I didn't want to load up awesomenauts again to test again, but if any of you try this, please tell me what it does!"	t5_2tvrv	True

My build is Size, Damage and less damage taken for Rage

I start out with piggy bank, solar tree and the movement upgrade and get rage, for the rest of the match i max out rage then get the More maximum health when you kill someone with the chain thing.

Is this technically the correct way to ""play"" Ayla? It seems to be the most efficient with me.

Oh and for Chain I use Damage, Lifesteal, Maximum Health

I don't get the third eye at all most of the time."	t5_2tvrv	True
