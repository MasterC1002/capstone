1356613589.0	15in05	Why can't I list every book I know, but I can tell you if I own it?	nilhaus	6785	3555	366	"Example: I have huge bookshelves full of books. If you blind folded me, and went through asking me did I own book X, I could tell you with 95-100% accuracy. You could even fake books, or ask me about books I don't own, I'd be able to tell you yes or no. However, if you asked me to list all my books and write it on a piece of paper, I'd be lucky to get 25% of them before running out of steam. 

Furthermore, when prompted with the book name, I could tell you the general plot of the book, list characters, describe the physical book, and maybe even when and where I got it. 

Why is this information only accessible one way, and not another? For lack of a better description, why can't my brain search by ""Books owned"" tag and return a list? The information is clearly there! 

I stumbled on this strangeness when someone asked me to list all 50 states. I could get about 75% of them before I started repeating, and only when I sketched a map was I able to fill in the rest. But when I had a map I could easily label every state.

1341382091.0	w0qgf	The official Higgs announcement thread.	Ruiner	6344	3937	770	"In a few hours, we will have an official announcement from the CERN teams about the searches for the Higgs boson. I'll update this afterwards.

(You should also check [the previous Higgs thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/naxmk/the_everything_you_need_to_know_about_the_higgs/) where many of the common questions were answered)

For many reasons, this is a very exciting moment for everyone in the community. Many of the older folks spent their life constructing all the building blocks of what we now know as the ""standard model of particle physics"", and the discovery of the Higgs ends this big chapter in our understanding of nature. For us younger physicists, this might be the first and only occasion in our lifetimes in which we get to witness a major experimental discovery in particle physics. 


The LHC was built because we were **sure** that something would be found, since the theory for electro-weak interactions without the Higgs becomes completely unpredictive once we cross this energy range. Since [W bosons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) are massive, they carry an extra degree of freedom - while light has 2 polarizations, both transverse to the direction of propagation of the light beam, W are also polarized in the direction parallel to their propagation. This longitudinal degree of freedom is troublesome, since it makes the probability of collision of W bosons collide grow very fast with the energy, so fast that it crosses the ""unitarity scale"", meaning that the sum of all the probabilities of different ways in which W bosons interact no longer add to 1.


When this happens, we need to ""resolve"" the interactions. This means that, while at large distances what we see is two W colliding, at short distances the Ws can also produces a particle and this particle again decays into Ws. Summing up all these contributions, we have again something finite. (Check the last 3 of these [diagrams](http://www.hep.lu.se/atlas/thesis/egede/thesis-img191.gif))


The Higgs - or whatever particle is in there at 126GeV - is very heavy and decays almost immediately into some lighter particles, so we cannot really produce it as a final state, thus we need indirect ways of detecting it. Check the above diagrams again: you see that the presence of the Higgs changes the ways in which the W bosons can scatter, so we can look for these signals. W bosons are also too heavy to be produced as a final state, so we need something else. We start by shooting protons against each other, and these protons contain 3 quarks each. The quarks can emit W bosons, and the W can also collide and produce a Higgs, as can be seen in this [diagram](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HGd0kIqlg9c/TzHA08T1kSI/AAAAAAAAAk4/oCfwX1eseKQ/s1600/vbf.png). Once the Higgs is produced, it will immediately decay into some light final state such as photons or quarks. What we really observe is an excess in the production of any of these final states when compared to the predictions of the same scattering without the Higgs. And in order to determine if the Higgs is really the Higgs, we compare the ""branching ratios"" of the theory with the experiment, which means that it has to produce just the ""right ammount"" of each final state.  


So is this guy also responsible for giving a mass to all the particles? Yes and no. In the real construction, the Higgs particle is part of something called the Higgs mechanism. In this mechanism, the energy is minimized once the Higgs field fills the whole space with a Higgs condensate: the field has a ""vacuum expectation value"", and the actual Higgs boson are just the excitations of this field, like ripples on the water. Almost every particle interacts with this field, and by this interaction they become massive.



* What changed since the last announcement?

Now they have more data and it's possible to say with a lot more certainty that there is in fact some particle with a mass of around 126 GeV. We'll have to wait until the announcement to know exactly how certain it is, but it's likely to be already above 5 sigma, so we can celebrate.

edit: 
now we have

from CMS: 125.3 +/- 0.6 GeV @ 4.9 sigma

from Atlas: 126.5 Gev @ 5.0 sigma



* Is it the Higgs?

It's needed more data. But their result seems to be compatible with the standard model Higgs.


* What now?

If it's really a Higgs, then we need to solve the Hierarchy problem or abandon the idea of naturalness. The problem is that the Higgs is ""unaturally light"", since quantum corrections would ""naturally"" make the Higgs mass as big as the Planck scale (10^19 GeV compared to the 126) and to make it light we need a an arbitrary cancellation that is heavily fine-tuned. The best candidates were supersymmetry and large extra dimensions, but it seems that both are very unlikely now.

If it's not a Higgs, then we probably will see more signals in the future, and the greatest theoretical challenge will be to figure out what exactly it is!"	t5_2qm4e	True
1344232927.0	xr3s0	The Official Mars Science Laboratory and Curiosity Rover Thread	rupert1920	6102	3747	1434	"As of 1:31 am, August 6, 2012 (EDT), NASA and Jet Propulsion Lab has successfully landed the [Curiosity Rover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27%27Curiosity%27%27_rover) at the [Gale Crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale_crater) of Mars, as part of the [Mars Science Laboratory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory) mission.

This is an exciting moment for all of us and I'm sure many of you are burning with questions. Here is a place for you to submit all your questions regarding the mission, the rover, and Mars!

Update:

----------

FAQs (summarized from [the official press release](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/MSLLanding.pdf)):

**What is the purpose of the mission?**

The four stated objectives are:

1. Assessing the biological potential by examining organic compounds - the ""building blocks of life"" - and searching for evidence of biologically relevant processes.

2. Uncovering the geological processes that formed the rocks and soil found on Mars, by studying the isotopical and mineralogical content of surface materials.

3. Investigate past and present habitability of Mars and the distribution and cycling of water and carbon dioxide.

4. Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation.

**How was the mission site chosen?**

In line with the mission objectives, Gale Crater is located at a low elevation, so past water would likely have pooled inside the crater, leaving behind evidence such as clay and sulfate minerals. The impact that created the crater also revealed many different layers, each of which will give clues on the planetary conditions at the time the material was deposited.

While previous landing sites must be chosen to safeguard the landing of the spacecraft, the new ""sky crane"" landing system allows for a much more accurate landing, which, combined with the mobility of the rover, meant that the mission site can be some distance from the landing site. The primary mission will focus on the lower elevations of the Gale Crater, with possible exploration in the higher slopes in future extended missions.

For a more detailed explanation see [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wvqwt/why_was_the_curiosity_rover_not_landed_at_the/c5h97sr).

**Why is the ""sky crane maneuver"" to land the rover?**

The Curiosity rover is the biggest - and more importantly, the heaviest - rover landed on Mars. It has a mass of 899 kg, compared to Spirit and Opportunity rovers, coming at 170 kg each. Prior strategies include landing the rover on legs, as the [Viking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander) and [Phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_lander) landers did, and using airbags, as [Spirit and Opportunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_and_Opportunity) did, but the sheer size and weight of Curiosity means those two methods are not practical.

**What happens to the descent stage after it lowers the rover?**

The descent stage of the spacecraft, after releasing the rover, is programmed to crash at least 150 metres (likely twice that distance) away from the lander, towards the North pole of Mars, to avoid contamination of the mission site. Currently there is no telemetry data on it yet.

**How long does it take for data to transmit one way between Earth and Mars?**

On the day of landing, it takes approximately 13.8 minutes for data to be transmitted one way directly from Curiosity to Earth via the Deep Space Network, at a data rate of 160 - 800 bits per second. Much of the data can also be relayed via the Mars orbiters ([Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter) and [Mars Odessy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Odyssey)) at 2 megabits per second.

See [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xo5vm/how_does_the_mars_rover_curiosity_send_radio/) for more detail.

**What are the differences between this rover and the previous ones landed on Mars?**

For an overview of the scientific payload, see the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27%27Curiosity%27%27_rover#Payload). This includes such valuable scientific instruments such as a [laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser-induced_breakdown_spectroscopy), not found in the previous rovers. The [gas chromatography system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_Chromatograph), [quadrupole mass spectrometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole_Mass_Spectrometer) and tuneable laser spectrometer are also part of the payload, not included in the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.

**Why were the [first images](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/images/first_images_mars.html) of such low resolution?**

The purpose for the first thumbnail images are to confirm that the Rover has landed and has operational capabilities. These images were taken from the Hazard Avoidance cameras (HazCams), rather than the main cameras. More images will be sent in the next window 15 hours after landing in order to pinpoint the landing site.

The Rover has a Mars Descent Imager capable of 1600 x 1200 video at 4 frames per second. The MastCam (with Bayer filter) is capable of 1600 x 1200 photographs, along with 720p video at 4 - 7 fps. The Hands Lens Imager is capable of the same image resolution for magnified or close-up images. The ChemCam can take 1024 x 1024 monochromatic images with telescopic capabilities. These cameras will be activated as part of the commissioning process with the rest of the scientific payload in the upcoming days/weeks.

**How is Curiosity powered?**

The Rover contains a [radioisotope thermoelectric power generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator), powered by 4.8 kg of plutonium dioxide. It is designed to provide power for at least 14 years.

[Discussion in comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/xr3s0/the_official_mars_science_laboratory_and/c5ouuh8).

**When will Curiosity take its first drive? When will experimentation begin?**

The first drive will take place more than one week after landing. It will take several weeks to a month to ensure that all systems are ready for science operations.

&gt;
&gt;...it boils down to this. This is not going to be a Katrina caliber storm. There's a hell of a lot of infrastructure in the region that is going to ensure a rapid response from emergency workers and the government. They've got a lot of warning. Katrina intensified rapidly right before landfall, Sandy isn't likely to. Also, the area isn't apt to flood and then stay flooded like New Orleans did.

Waldamos	6155	4212	477	"Edit: To clarify, no fossils.  Of course a fossil would show the trunk impression.  My reason for asking this question is to understand when only bones are found of animals not alive today or during recorded history how scientists can determine what soft appendages were present.

Edit 2: from a picture of an elephant skull we would have to assume they were mouth breathers or the trunk attachment holes were the nose.  From that we could see (from the bone) that muscles attached around the nose and were powerful, but what leads us to believe it was 5 foot long instead of something more of a strong pig snout?

Edit 3: so far we have assumed logically that an animal with tusks could not forage off the ground and would be a herbivore.  However, this still does not mean it would require a trunk.  It could eat off of trees and elephants can kneel to drink provided enough water so their tusks don't hit bottom.

Edit 4: Please refrain from posting ""good question"" or any other comment not furthering discussion.  If this gets too many comments it will be hard to get a panelist up top.  Just upboat so it gets seen!

Edit 5: We have determined that they would have to have some sort of proboscis due to the muscle attachments, however, we cannot determine the length (as of yet).  It could be 2 foot to act as a straw when kneeling, or it could have been forked.  Still waiting for more from the experts.

**Edit 6:** I have been told that no matter if I believe it or not, scientist would come up with a trunk theory based on the large number of muscle connections around the nose opening (I still think the more muscles = stronger, not longer).  **Based on the experts replies: we can come to this conclusion with a good degree of certainty.

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere are on the cusp of reaching 400 parts per million for the first time in 3 million years.

The daily CO2 level, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, was 399.72 parts per million last Thursday, and a few hourly readings had risen to more than 400 parts per million.

''I wish it weren't true but it looks like the world is going to blow through the 400 ppm level without losing a beat,'' said Ralph Keeling, a geologist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US, which operates the Hawaiian observatory.

''At this pace we'll hit 450 ppm within a few decades.''

Epistaxis	3261	1502	395	"The ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is a collection of 442 scientists from 32 laboratories around the world, which has been using a wide variety of high-throughput methods to annotate functional elements in the human genome: namely, 24 different kinds of experiments in 147 different kinds of cells. It was launched by the US National Human Genome Research Institute in 2003, and the ""pilot phase"" analyzed 1% of the genome in great detail. The initial results were published in 2007, and ENCODE moved on to the ""production phase"", which scaled it up to the entire genome; the full-genome results were published last Wednesday in ENCODE-focused issues of [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue.html#af), [*Genome Research*](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/current), and [*Genome Biology*](http://genomebiology.com/).

**What are the results?**

[Eric Lander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Lander) characterizes ENCODE as the successor to the [Human Genome Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project): where the genome project simply gave us an assembled sequence of all the letters of the genome, ""like getting a picture of Earth from space"", ""it doesn’t tell you where the roads are, it doesn’t tell you what traffic is like at what time of the day, it doesn’t tell you where the good restaurants are, or the hospitals or the cities or the rivers."" In contrast, ENCODE is more like Google Maps: a layer of functional annotations on top of the basic geography.

* **Advice concerning classes/school/college/how to be a paleontologist:**

Well, to get right to it, a good paleontologist is good at both geology and biology. When I was in college, this was my course list:

Physical Geology

Physical Geography

Mineralogy

Igneous, Metamorphic and Sedimentary Petrology

Sedimentology and Stratigraphy

Geomorphology

Structural Geology

That covers the geology side, more or less. I had a few electives (meteorology, oceanography, tectonics). You really need a good solid base in geology to understand how time is recorded in the rock!

My paleo courses consisted of the following:

Vertebrate Paleontology

'Invertebrate Paleontology

Paleontology Lab Techniques

Taphonomy

Macroevolution and the Fossil Record

Geobiology

Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy

Dinosaurs (A 101 class I took for fun ;) )

Paleontology is as competitive as any other field. People make a big fuss about jobs being tight, and they're not wrong, but I find that there is a lot of work out there, it isn't all in Academia- you can work with museum collections, consulting companies, and colleges or private institutions.

What's it like being a paleontologist? Well, sometimes there's nothing more rewarding or more stressful. I love it. It's hard work and the science is challenging sometimes, but the most important thing to remember is to keep yourself motivated. If you want to do it, DO IT. Don't look to others for confirmation or support. Support yourself. Be confident in your decisions, and never stop learning. I saw a lot of students begin a paleontology major who did not anticipate the hard-core scientific load they were undertaking. There is a lot of difficult coursework with paleontology. It's not just ""dinosaur appreciation club"". You need to know your shit. You will have to put up with a lot of crap that you don't like. I had to retake calculus 1 five times before I finally passed. Don't get stuck thinking ""why do I need this?"". That is a waste of time, and it will only distract you and drain your energy. Focus on what else you could be doing with your time. Don't be a book worm, either- get out of the classroom and get field experience. Lots of museums look for volunteers for the summer. You don't have to pay to go on an excavation. Take the time to track down some paleontology professors. Hamper them (without being irritating ;) ) and get to know them. A lot of times they will have research projects that you can assist on, and THAT will get you into grad school better than straight A's.

Many of you saw the new [""sponsored content""](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1bd7rl/meta_introducing_askscience_sponsored_content/) plans on AskScience.  We introduced it at about 6:30 AM in the timezone of New Zealand, and have kept it going through sometime this afternoon (though it got more and more ridiculous as time went on!).  We progressed from shilling oil to shilling homeopathy and quantum healing.

We broke our own rules (non-scientific content on AskScience).  We also broke with the time-honored convention of assuming every redditor is in an American time zone.  

Many of you were not amused by our clear abandonment of the preferred time zones and unsubscribed in protest (though bizarrely we have more subscribers now than when we started).  Those of you who fell for it shouldn't feel too bad: some of our own panelists who missed the memo were even angrier than you. We can all be somewhat proud that some of them resigned in protest, at least until we pointed out the date.

Our modmail and PM volume was much higher than normal - both people who were extremely amused, and people who were extremely angry.  Over the day, the mods got called every name in the book, and got called on to resign (more than once).  

And while we don't like getting angry mail, we like seeing how much everyone cares about this corner of the web, and rest assured that we care about it too.  Everyone pulled together to make sure the crappy sellouts who mod this place didn't get their way, and we thought it was awesome that so many people were so defensive of AskScience's integrity.  But rest assured: no one is going to be putting any Sponsored Content in, we haven't hired an [inept PR person](http://www.reddit.com/user/sponsoredpr), and the guidelines of the subreddit are firmly in place.

There was no Grand Design or pedantic lesson behind this joke (we just thought it would be fun!), but two things should be made clear:

* Scientists aren't humorless robots

* And industrial science isn't inherently bad (many of our panelists work in industry, and are great scientists).  The intent wasn't to mock industry, it was to mock transparent PR, and to have fun pretending like we were blatant sellouts.

So, it's back to business as normal on AskScience.  Sound off below if you have something you want to say about the April Fool's prank, or if you have *anything* to say about AskScience.

**Edit:** To further the joke, we had been removing everything that mentioned April Fool's.  We're going back and undeleting those, so you can see how many of those posts there were."	t5_2qm4e	True

We are nuclear fusion scientists from the Alcator C-Mod tokamak at MIT, one of the US's major facilities for fusion energy research.

But there's a problem - in this year's budget proposal, the US's domestic fusion research program has taken a big hit, and Alcator C-Mod is on the chopping block.  Many of us in the field think this is an incredibly bad idea, and we're fighting back - students and researchers here have set up an [independent site](http://www.fusionfuture.org) with information, news, and how you can help fusion research in the US.

So here we are - ask us anything about fusion energy, fusion research and tokamaks, and science funding and how you can help it!

1323780554.0	naxmk	"The ""everything you need to know about the Higgs boson"" thread."	Ruiner	3235	1685	465	"Since the Cern announcement is coming in 1 hour or so, I thought it would be nice to compile a FAQ about the Higgs and let this thread open so you guys could ask further questions.

1) **Why we need the Higgs:**

We know that the carriers of the weak interaction - the W and Z bosons - are ~~massless~~ massive (typo).  We observed that experimentally. We could just write down the theory and state that these particles have a ""hard mass"", but then we'd go into troubles. The problems with the theory of a massive gauge boson is similar to problem of ""naive quantum gravity"", when we go to high energies and try to compute the probability of scattering events, we break ""unitarity"": probabilities no longer add to 1. 

The way to cure this problem is by adding a particle that mediates the interaction. In this case, the interaction of the W is not done directly, but it's mediated by a spin-0 particle, called the Higgs boson.

2) **Higgs boson and Higgs field**

In order for the Higgs to be able to give mass to the other particles, it develops a ""vacuum expectation value"". It literally means that the vacuum is filled with something called the Higgs field, and the reason why these particles have mass is because while they propagate, they are swimming in this Higgs field, and this interaction gives them inertia. 

But this doesn't happen to all the particles, only to the ones that are able to interact with the Higgs field. Photons and neutrinos, for instance, don't care about the Higgs.

In order to actually verify this model, we need to produce an excitation of the field. This excitation is what we call the Higgs boson. That's easy to understand if you think in terms of electromagnetism: suppose that you have a very big electric field everywhere: you want to check its properties, so you produce a disturbance in the electric field by moving around a charge. What you get is a propagating wave - a disturbance in the EM field, which we call a photon. 

3) **Does that mean that we have a theory of everything?**

No, see responses [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/na0tp/if_evidence_of_the_higgs_is_released_on_tuesday/).

4) **What's the difference between Higgs and gravitons?**

Answered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nafdw/whats_the_difference_between_the_higgs_boson_and/).

5) **What does this mean for particle physics?**

It means that the Standard Model, the model that describes weak, electromagnetic and strong nuclear interactions is *almost* complete. But that's not everything: we still have to explain how Neutrinos get masses (the neutrino oscillations problem) and also explain why the Higgs mass is so small compared to the Planck mass (the Hierarchy problem). So just discovering the Higgs would also be somewhat bittersweet, since it would shed no light on these two subjects.

6) **Are there alternatives to the Higgs?**

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgsless_model). Short answer: no phenomenological viable alternative. Just good ideas, but no model that has the same predictive power of the Higgs. CockroachED pointed out this other reddit thread on the subject: http://redd.it/mwuqi

7) **Why do we care about it?**

Ongoing discussion on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nawxu/my_partner_asked_me_why_we_should_be_interested/) thread. My 2cents: We don't know, but the only way to know is by researching it. 60 years ago when Dirac was conjecturing about the Dirac sea and antiparticles, he had no clue that today we would have PET scans working on that principle. 

EDIT: Technical points to those who are familiar with QFT:

Yes, neutrinos do have mass! But in the standard Higgs electro-weak sector, they do not couple to the Higgs. That was actually regarded first as a nice prediction of the Higgs mechanism, since neutrinos were thought to be massless formerly, but now we know that they have a very very very small mass. 

No, Gauge Invariance is not the reason why you need Higgs. For those who are unfamiliar, you can use the Stückelberg Language to describe massive vector bosons, which is essentially the same as taking the self-coupling of the Higgs to infinity and you're left with the Non-Linear Sigma Model of the Goldstones in SU(2). But we know that this is not renormalizable and violates perturbative unitarity.

I explained that it there was no such thing as a King bee, and it probably never happened that a 'boy' bee was fed Royal Jelly, but he insisted I 'ask the internet people', so here I am.

1369756785.0	1f7e2k	I am the lead author of a recent paper describing a new phage mediated immunity/symbiosis on mucus surfaces. Ask me anything about our work!	jjberg2	2523	1031	263	"I am Jeremy J Barr (/u/JeremyJBarr), the lead author on a recent, open access, PNAS paper [Bacteriophage adhering to mucus provide a non-host-derived immunity](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/05/16/1305923110.abstract). 

Our research from [The Rohwer Lab](http://phuckitphage.org/) at [San Diego State University](http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=74269) investigates a new symbiosis formed between bacteriophage, which are tiny viruses that only infect and kill bacteria, and mucus, the slimy, protective coating found in your mouth, lungs, gut, and also on a large number of other animals, such as fish, corals, and worms.

We show that bacteriophage, or phage for short, stick to mucus surfaces across a diverse range of organisms. They do this by displaying an immunoglobulin-like protein fold on their capsid, or head, which grabs hold of sugars found within mucus. These mucus-adherent phage reduce the number of bacteria that grow on 
mucosal surfaces and protect the underlying animal host from infection.

This symbiotic interaction benefits the mucus-producing animal host by limiting mucosal bacterial infections, and benefits the mucus-adherent phage through more frequent interactions with bacterial hosts. We call this symbiosis/immunity, Bacteriophage Adherence to Mucus, or BAM for short. BAM could have significant impacts across a diverse number of fields, including, human immunity, prevention of mucosal infections, phage therapy, and environmental/biotechnology applications.

Outreach can happen in a number of ways. Typically, in /r/AskScience we do it in the question/answer format, where the panelists (experts) respond to any scientific questions that come up. Another way is through the AMA series. With the AMA series, we've lined up 1, or several, of the panelists to discuss—in depth and with grueling detail—what they do as scientists. 


Well, today, we're doing something like that. Today, all of our panelists are ""on call"" and the AMA will be led by an aspiring grade school scientist: /u/science-bookworm! 


Recently, /r/AskScience was approached by a 9 year old and their parents who wanted to learn about what a few real scientists do. We thought it might be better to let her ask her questions directly to _lots of scientists_. And with this, we'd like this AMA to be an opportunity for the entire /r/AskScience community to join in -- a one-off mass-AMA to ask not just about the science, but the process of science, the realities of being a scientist, and everything else our work entails.


Here's how today's AMA will work:

* Only panelists make top-level comments (i.e., direct response to the submission); the top-level comments will be brief (2 or so sentences) descriptions, from the panelists, about their scientific work.

* Everyone else responds to the top-level comments. 


We encourage everyone to ask about panelists' research, work environment, current theories in the field, how and why they chose the life of a scientists, favorite foods, how they keep themselves sane, or whatever else comes to mind!

Sometimes things don't work out perfectly - but I'm not finished yet!  Thank you again SO much for all your help and expertise.**

Dear AskScience,

First of all, thank you for once again interacting with my students and *me*!  You're all my favorite people on the internet, and you always go above and beyond.  

I am currently working with a group of 2nd graders once a week during an afterschool program.  We are working on a project to create a book about animals, in which each student will contribute a page.  Each student has chosen an animal, examined a picture of it, and generated questions about that animal.  They have made some predictions about their questions, and are now seeking answers.  We have discussed several ways students can research the answers to their questions.  One resource that isn’t often talked about is asking an expert.  This is where you come in, AskScience!


Our 2nd graders are very eager to learn and are excited about getting to ask scientists about the animals they have chosen.  Some questions are more in-depth than others; as an expert, perhaps you might be able to supply them with some additional information, fun facts, or prompts that might lead them into asking deeper questions.  On my end, I will be walking around monitoring responses, helping students to understand and respond to the answers, and generate new questions.   When this is over, the students will be writing a few sentences about their animal, will find or draw some pictures, and will compose a page that will go into the final, published book.

Please remember that these students are about 7 and 8 years old, so choosing appropriate language is important!  I have absolute faith in the AskScience community.  (I would ask if anyone has a potentially offensive/inappropriate username, they post on a throwaway. )  The students will post on a shared account: ""2ndGrader"".  I will be posting on my own account.  Hopefully everything will go smoothly!

Again, thank you so much for being a wonderful community, and thank you to the individuals who are taking the time to respond to the children.  If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me!

My questions are those in the title, I'll develop them the best I can. So theorically, let's imagine we have some deep sea fishes in our possession. Could they survive in an aquarium ? First, in a classic one with no specifities (just a basic tank full of sea water) ? And second, maybe in a special one, with everything they could need (pressure, special nutriments...) ?

I guess this brings another question such as ""Do they need this high pressure to live ?"" and another ""Could we recreate their natural environment ?""

The previous questions supposed that we had such fishes in our possession, so the next question is ""Is it possible to catch one ? And after catching it, taking it up ?"". Obviously not with a fishing rod, but maybe with a special submarine and a big net... (this sounds a bit silly)...


And then, if we can catch some, imagine we have a male and a female, could they breed ?

And Welcome to New Users!** Ask you have probably heard, r/AskScience recently became one of the default subreddits for new users of Reddit. This is a big step for us as a community! We're proud to have ushered this subreddit to the point where the admins think that all users of Reddit should be exposed to us.

As you may have noticed over the past 48 hours, this also provides us with a new list of challenges. In response to the blog post announcing that we were a new subreddit, we gained around 4700 subscribers, a 7% increase in our population in a single day. As such, I'm going to take this moment to remind you of the rules, or if you're new tell you them for the first time.

**TL;DR: We have rules. Follow them. No herp-derping allowed.**

**The Rules Of AskScience** (Updated Oct 20, 2011)

1. Here at AskScience, our goal is to provide an atmosphere for accurate discussion about scientific topics. We want to stay on topic and avoid distractions. As such, off-topic comments are not permitted.

2. Our goal is expert scientific responses to questions. Speculation should be deeply rooted in science, and ideally come from those with strong scientific background in that field. Either here or in real life, anecdotes are not scientific data, and don't provide good scientific insight, so please refrain from using anecdote to answer questions.

3. We don't answer personal medical questions. While medicine is certainly part of science, many of our panelists and our moderators feel it is impossible to accurately answer a medical question while maintaining both confidentiality and providing an accurate answer. It is also a serious breach of medical ethics for a doctor to provide that kind of 'distance diagnosis.'

4. Before you submit a question, please use [Searchreddit.com](http://www.searchreddit.com) to see if it has been asked in the before. Read the previous threads, and if your specific question still hasn't been answered feel free to submit that *specific* question as a clarification on the old thread.

5. We don't do homework help. If you need help with your homework, go to [r/HomeworkHelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp).

6. We are not here to discuss religion outside of the context of sociology. As such, questions explicitly about religion or hate speech or insults for any reason will be immediately deleted.

7. Open ended questions with no specific answer are prohibited.

**How The Rules are Enforced**

As moderators, our job here is to enforce the rules to make sure that discussions proceed smoothly and, most importantly, make sure that questions get answers. Every once in a while, one of us will go through a thread and clean up any comments we feel are veering out of control. But we **need your help!** There are only so many of us, and we can only catch so much. *I'll say it again. We cannot do this without your help.*Here is how you can help us enforce the rules:

*This section updated Oct 28, 2011*

If you see a comment that isn't following the rules, do all of the following: a) downvote b) press the 'Report' button to anonymously alert the moderators. Please do not post in a thread repeatedly explaining to people why they are being downvoted. It used to serve an important function, however they eventually become distracting.

More explicitly, here are the things that should be downvoted, reported and kindly replied to every time:

1. Jokes in top level comments.

2. Memes.

3. Conversation not directly related to the question or a follow up question. 

4. Speculation.

5. Anecdotes.


**Panelists**

One of the most important mechanisms for making sure questions get answered is our panelist system. Panelists are people who have informed us that they are REAL scientists who are taking the time to answer questions here. Their specialties are noted by the colored tags next to their names, and the color relates to what science they study. 

Just because someone is a panelist doesn't mean they are right though! Ask them follow-up questions, ask for citations! Critical analysis of what people say is an important part of getting the most of the AskScience experience. While we can't and won't ask people to cite everything they say, if you aren't going to completely explain a topic please provide a citation so that those who want to know more have a source to go to.

Also keep in mind there are other experts who frequent AskScience. Just because someone isn't a panelist doesn't mean they are wrong!

**Not Interested in Science?**

Okay by us! If you're not interested in seeing content from AskScience, thats fine too! In the top right corner of the screen, under the search bar, you'll see a red button that says ""Unsubscribe."" Click it and AskScience will stop showing up in your Reddit front page unless you click subscribe later.

**Why are we doing this?**

Over the past couple of days, we have received a lot of kind messages from people letting us know how much they like AskScience. They have also expressed concern that the quality of AskScience will decrease with the flood of new users. We'd like to take a few moments to address those concerns.

The past 48 hours have been very exciting but also a lot like drinking out of a fire hose for the moderation team. But we believe that trying out being a default subreddit is a worthwhile experiment for us. We know that because of the community that we have built and the strong moderation we have become known for that there is a lot of good and we want to see that grow. It is an *experiment* and if in a week or two we decide that we cannot both be a default subreddit and maintain high quality, we will remove ourselves from the default subreddit list.

You may have noticed a lot more off-topic conversation in the past 48 hours. We have been doing our best to try to keep this under control, but because of the exposure provided by the new default subreddit announcement things have gotten a bit ahead of us. We are optimistic about this getting better, though, because we really do believe that this is blog post exposure, not new users. We've been informally keeping track and about 95% of the comments we've deleted in the past 48 hours have been from experienced Redditors, not new users (who have been very well behaved). 

Finally, the reason that we're committed to trying this out is because we care about science education. As its often noted on Reddit and other places, improving the scientific literacy of the general public benefits society as a whole and positively impacts the greater community. To quote the [reddit admins directly](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/independence.html):

&gt;The reddit team, our Board, our informal advisors, and many in the reddit community sincerely believe that reddit has the potential, over the next generation, to positively impact journalism, civic engagement, fundraising, product development, and learning.

The obvious answer is that quantum physics takes over when u reach the quantum scale, by i was wondering if there was some overlap of physical rules as the scale approaches the quantum? or is there a hard line of measurement where very slightly smaller is quantum rules, and very slightly above this limit is standard physics?

i am also completely amazed that the universe can operate with 2 (or more??) sets of rules that are incompatible with each other. How could these differing sets of rules both be describing the same events so differently? One example that springs to mind is throwing a ball against a wall.

Is it possible that the first ""seconds"" of the Big Bang lasted billions of years because of this?"	niklaskronwalled	2799	1491	226	"Kind of a strange question, I'm not sure if it makes sense, but I'll do my best to explain...

I know that, theoretically, if an observer were to exist in time and space right outside the event horizon of a black hole, and they were there for a year, for example, this year to them would actually be several years to an observer here on earth.  When an observer is close to a lot of matter, or when it is moving at very high speeds (or both), time moves more slowly than it otherwise would.

Also, as I understand it, we believe that the Big Bang happened 15 Billion years ago because we see the speed with which the Universe is expanding, and we can calculate that it must have been expanding for 15 billion years from a central point.  I'm not exactly sure how they calculate the ""age"" of the Universe, but I think this is the 'jist' of it.

With these things in mind, is it possible that the *actual* age of the Universe is far greater (possibly infinitely) than the 15 billion year consensus?  I imagine the first couple nano-seconds of the Big Bang, and I know that there is a great deal of mass moving with tremendous velocity.  Is it possible that time has a telescoping effect as we move further back in time, closer and closer to the moment of ""origin""?  That what we currently calculate as the first ""second"" of the Universe actually lasted millions of years **in those moments** due to the seemingly elastic nature of time?

**EDIT:**

Thanks for all the replies!  I am still catching up, reading them.

A summary (shoot me a PM if I've erred in this!):

It has been pointed out many times that ""Psychopathy"" and ""Sociopathy"" tend to be used interchangably, while ""Anti-Social Personality Disorder"" is considered to be quite different, based on behaviour rather than personality.  I think I recall reading that the DSM only focuses on ASPD.

There seems to be some disagreement on the subject of whether Psychopathy is inborn or not, and relatedly, whether it is something a person can be ""a little bit of"".  I had always thought it stemmed from a structural difference in the brain.  I haven't read anything so far which would suggest this.  I have asked /r/askscience if it was heritable before, but received no consensus.  (ASPD, however, seems to be at least partially, if not fully, based on learned behaviour.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the general consensus tends to be that psychopaths may recognize that they are different than others, but few of the estimated 1% of people who are thought to be psychopathic would go out of their way to actually get themselves diagnosed.  Typically such a diagnosis is not important except in the case of delinquency, which blurs the line between psychopathy and ASPD, as explained above."	t5_2qm4e	True
1344537951.0	xyazh	How come if I smack a fly in mid-air (not smashing him against a wall) it seems to be completely ineffective? If I were flying around, and a proportionally larger creature smacked me, I imagine I'd be reduced to liquid. 	JakeLV426	2901	1596	296	"Are flies made of Adamantium? Or, more likely, is there some kind of weight/mass/size measure that reduces the force of my (to a fly) gigantic hand delivering an epic smack? 

Edit: Thanks everyone for offering your expertise, I feel much more enlightened on mass and inertia, as well as the proportional durability of insect exoskeletons. Moving forward, I will be annihilating flies with a machine gun. 

Edit 2: I'm once again reminded how many people know way more science than me. This has been incredibly interesting conversation, thanks to all of you! 

Edit 3: I can't believe this goof question got to the top of /r/askscience!! All you brilliant minds out there answering and discussing are amazing.

Edit 4: To all the people saying I should just hit them harder, or use a rolled up magazine, or a salt gun....Yes, I understand. I know HOW to kill a fly...I have killed many and am capable of fly murder...I was just curious about the science of a fly shaking off a swat and what's involved in size/mass/velocity proportions, etc.. But thank you for the advice, I am now armed with about a hundred methods of swatting flies.

This week I'm lucky enough to attend the [62nd meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany](http://www.lindau-nobel.org/). It's an opportunity for Laureates to engage with young researchers, and now by proxy, you: This week I'm happy to get as many of your science questions answered by the most influential people in science.    

There is limited wi-fi available but I will check this thread whenever I can, and respond as often as possible. If you have a specific question for a particular Laureate then make mention, otherwise 'general' questions will be asked to any Laureates accessible to me. The meeting goes all of this week, so for this week, Ask A Laureate Anything!

Happy Sciencing, and ask away because ""the smartest people in the room, ask the most questions""  

Current update: There were only three Laureates (Grunsfeld, Josephson and Mollina) at the dinner tonight, but the rest will be present for the talks tomorrow. Even though a reddit post has a lifetime of ~24 hours I will ensure that as many questions as possible get answered, and I will update each of them during the breaks. There will be a Higgs broadcast from the CERN group at 11am local Lindau time, and follow-up discussion with Laureates about the Higgs discovery at 3pm."	t5_2qm4e	True

to keep it short, migrating birds migrate, which means when it gets cold they go south and are back when it's not cold anymore. I don't know much about bird evolution but I guess this is something a species learns to do over a lot of generations.
so I was thinking: if they get this pigeon back from the deads, will the first generation of born-again species know where to go and when? for dna-engraved instinct stuff or something like that. Or will they just need to re-learn from the start? "	t5_2qm4e	True

1329359051.0	probq	Congratulations to our community! Yes, you!	shavera	2880	1659	405	"So it's been about a year since I personally joined AskScience. And I remember right around this time last year, we had so many threads about how the reddit was falling apart and how if we wanted to be best little community next year we'd need to do this or that to keep our quality high. In that year, we've undergone tremendous growth and largely managed to maintain or even increase our quality. There's a lot going on behind the scene you may not be aware of, but the stuff you see up front, the downvotes, the reports, that's you guys. And we thank you for it.

When we first went default there were a few weeks of shake up and near burn-out on the moderation staff. And you know who stepped up for us and made that possible? Our community. All of the readers who spoke together through votes and even a few useful moderation scripts,  to make that transition happen. We came to threads to clean them up to find that the worst stuff was buried under a mountain of downvotes. You guys all know what we want here, and it's become clear that it's something you want too.

So we thank you all so much for nominating and selecting us as best moderators of 2011, as cliché as it sounds, it really wouldn't have been possible without you guys, the entire community supporting our vision for this reddit. Best Big community hasn't been announced yet, but we're still tremendously honored to be included in the finalist positions in that category as well. 

To celebrate our entire community's achievement, everyone's been given some gold star flair!

---

okay I wrote that back when we had only won moderator. Having won community now... well that really is all about you guys. First our panelists. Seriously you guys are awesome for taking time out of your days to educate... anybody really that comes along. 

And our readers, again, we appreciate everything you do for us. You guys make this community what it is. There may be a few vocal people that don't care for the way it's run, but this is yet another confirmation that *you share our goals*. And there's nothing more that we could ask from you all. 

So thanks everyone! Enjoy your gold stars. And have an updram on us. (not really on us though).

So, out of the giant amount of muscles a human body has, why is just the heart made this way? I can only think that it's a bit of a ""braking"" mechanism to make sure you don't fatally exhaust yourself, because if you never felt fatigue from your muscles there wouldn't be a point to stop whatever it is you are doing.

Is the heart a special kind of muscle, or is it wired in a special way? 

I know there are stories of people lifting cars off babies, and other things that are able to be explained by adrenaline rushes, but it seems like the ability to not get tired would have been a pretty huge evolutionary benefit to our ancestors.

If an a/c is in room A, which is the fastest way to cool down room B: a fan pointing OUT of room B at the TOP of the door, or a fan pointing IN to room B at the BOTTOM of the door?	helloalicehello	1901	718	295	"So there's a box fan. Which will most efficiently move out warm air and move in cool air? Having the fan at the top of the doorway, pointing out and naturally sucking cold air into the room, or having the fan on the floor, blowing cold air in and forcing warmer air out?

I have the fan facing out. My thinking is that if the fan is facing in, since the cold air is the strong current and low to the ground (roughly 1/4 door height is air going in, 3/4 is pushed out), it may end up pushing out some of the colder, leaving the hot air at the top fairly untouched. By putting the fan facing out, it's forcing the warmer air into the air conditioned room. IDK, it makes sense to me but I guess I can't articulate it.

**Edit: NOW WITH ~~100%~~ INFINITELY MORE DIAGRAM**

Some people seem a bit confused about the question, so here. Room A has the air conditioner. Room B does not. Which method will most efficiently cool room B? Efficiency includes both speed and total air replacement (which one ends up with less hot air at the top of the room?

Another argument is that the skin under our nail is pulled off by our nail so slowly that the pain receptors are not set off and we feel nothing. This is also what people on this thread think is true with hairs, the process is so slow that our body either can't or chooses not to set off pain receptors; otherwise we'd be in constant pain.

**UPDATE 1: SOME ANSWERS:** Most itching is actually a matter of perception and not from an actual external stimuli.

Last I remember (class in undergrad 10 years ago?), there are some indications of art, bone tools, harpoons (?). More reliable indications of caring for the elderly and for burial, and post-Mousterian toolset innovations. There seemed to be new findings about Neanderthal art and tools coming in occasionally, and they were always followed by Zilhao &amp; d'Errico writing something like a ""See! Told you *too* Neanderthals are super duper smart!"" kind of interpretation and Paul Mellars writing something like ""oh, it's misattributed and misdated, but if it turns out to somehow be Neanderthals, they prolly just stole it from a nearby sapien and didn't know what the hell it did"". So did this question get resolved somehow? What's the general consensus on Neanderthals? Did they make cave paintings? Did they have music? Could they sew? Did they invent the Chatelperronian toolset or did they just steal all the ideas of the Aurignacian without figuring out what did what? Or does that even matter?

1328117704.0	p6csa	Evolution, why I don't understand it.	Abusing	2883	1797	724	"Hi Reddit! There's a few questions that I haven't been able to piece together answers for in my head on the subject of evolution. I'll start with what my brain is working with.

Evolution as I understand it: Any favorable mutation, whether small or large, to an organism will tend to tip the scales of survival in it's favor  against its competition in its environment. This increases its likelihood of surviving and reproducing. This mutation is likely to carry on to future generations. This process is continuously ongoing and is easily observed over large lengths of time.

I hope that's right. My English is decent, but I can't really articulate my questions in an elegant way. I'll use an example for each of my questions to try to make them a bit more clear. Feel free to crush my assumptions and mistakes, but try to focus on the idea behind the example, more than the specifics of the example itself.

1) Development of new genus

How do minor, random mutations cause such specific long term changes in any organism. Example. Let's take fish who makes the eventual transition into a land based creature. This fish would have to randomly acquire the ability to absorb oxygen from the air, develop limbs to move on land, change its ""skin"" to survive in air and compete against an entire new world of predators. All of these changes would also have to be favorable to the organism as well. My brain tells me the likelihood of this happening, no matter the length of time, is so remote it seems negligible. 

2) Adaptation vs Evolution

Why do various different species, develop similar traits, in a common environment as opposed to a great variety of adaptations to the same environment. Example: Why would the loss/diminishment of a sense to a large group of organisms be a favorable change to all these organisms. i.e; Troglobites. Almost universally blind, but their ancestors are all creatures which had the ability to see. Why/How did this trait (blindness) become favored, almost universally, over competing organisms who could see?

2.5) Adaptation vs Lamarckism

On the same thought as question 2. Has Lamarckism been proven false in long term scenarios. I understand use and disuse in a few generations not being observed, but how about over thousands of generations? Millions? Would a colony of rats, living in a scentless environment (theoretically) over a large amount of generations lose their sense of smell? Would this be because of disuse or natural selection?

3) Can humans keep evolving? 

With our massive gene pool, lack of competition and the ability to change our environment to suit us, instead of the other way around. Will our evolution continue? Is it possible we regress as a species? Traits that would not be favorable in a competitive environment are accepted and passed on to future generations in this current day.

In what order do the rooms go dark?	dk00111	2209	1164	178	"I know that the room goes dark when all of the photons are absorbed by the wall, but how does the color/material of the walls affect how fast the light is absorbed?

My guess would be that the black room would go dark first, but how about the other two? Does the fact that white paint scatters the light affect the rate that it's absorbed?

Side Questions: 

1) How about non-black/white colors. Would the times be different between a red and yellow room?

2) Does shape affect the time? Would there be any difference between a black, cubic room and a black, spherical room?

A little background info to prevent confusion:

* I live in Minnesota, not near any large bodies of water

* This picture was taken an a sunny 75 degree day

* I'm assuming that it is a metal fence with some kind of rubber/plastic coating(do not know for sure)

* and the fence is probably well over 10 years old



So r/askscience, what causes this to happen? And what makes them go in such designs? I'd really love to know.

EDIT: Another side note, on some parts you can peel it off, and it sort o reminds me of something like dried wood glue or something. Could it possibly be some sort of resin from when they put the coating on or glued the coating onto the fence?

**EDIT:**
**Answering some frequently asked questions**

* No, it isn't from the pine needles. Well, it may be in that certain section, but also occurs on parts of the fence that aren't even near any plants I'll upload pictures of different parts of the fence that aren't near any plants at all when i get the chance

* No, the fence is not anywhere near an: open pit mine, large body of water, stone working company, cement company, plaster casting, metal blasting, salt storage, busy road, farm etc I live in a normal suburban neighbourhood.

* We don't have a sprinkler system, basically the only time the fence gets wet is from the rain

* Also just thought I'd say that the residue type stuff has been there for a long time, it hasn't just recently occured

IVIilitarus	2246	1219	311	"To clarify, this would be the galaxy's crappiest ion drive equivalent. Since ion drives eject ions to generate thrust, the force generated is tiny, but will continuously accelerate an object in the vacuum, I want to know how long a flashlight ejecting photons would do the same, since it does have a tiny amount of force that's exerted onto the flashlight when the photons are ejected, being Newton's Laws and somesuch.

To make it simpler - Any weight of flashlight and luminosity can be used, but I'd rather not have some kind of super light flashlight with ultra-luminosity. Just a flashlight that you can pull off of a shelf in a store.

The batter weighs as much whatever batteries are used in the model of flashlight, but do not change in mass as they run and do not run out.

The environment is a perfect vacuum with as little gravitational influence as possible.

How long would it take to accelerate this flashlight to 350m/s? (approx. the speed of sound in dry air)

How long will it take to accelerate the flashlight to near-lightspeed?

How long will it take to accelerate to 120km/h? (highway speed)

I read about it somewhere that no matter how heavy a spacecraft is, if there is no outside influence heavier than a flashlight, then pointing a flashlight out the ass end will eventually cause acceleration, even if it's millenia from now. It's not meant to be practical. Just to make people go ""Cool"" that a flashlight could theoretically propel a spacecraft.

Ms_Christine	1527	500	726	"As I suggested in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hbxjx/would_raskscience_be_up_for_fielding_questions/) thread, I have questions from eager 6th graders to scientists!

I will post each question as a separate comment, followed by the student's initials.

School today is from 8:00 AM to 2:15 PM EST.

If anyone is interested in Skyping in to the class to answer a few questions, please let me know!

Just a few guidelines, please:

- Please try to avoid swearing.  I know this is reddit, but this is a school environment for them!

* Please try to explain in your simplest terms possible!  English is not the first language for all the students, so keep that in mind.

* If questions are of a sensitive nature, please try to avoid phrasing things in a way that could be offensive.  There are students from many different religious and cultural backgrounds.  Let's avoid the science vs religion debate, even if the questions hint at it.

* Other than that, have fun!

These students are very excited at the opportunity to ask questions of real, live scientists!

Hopefully we can get a few questions answered today.  We will be looking at some responses today, and hopefully more responses tomorrow.

I hope you're looking forward to this as much as I and the class are!

Thank you again for being so open to this!

Surrender_monkey21	1699	686	192	It is my understanding that there are very precise points of magnetised sectors within a hard drive, an expansion of just fractions of millimetres could disrupt the whole hard drive, or so I would presume.

1351961793.0	12kisk	Do house spiders have a symbiotic relationship with humans?	_delirium	1793	783	220	"Some species of spiders seem to have evolved to mainly live in or near human habitations (European house spider, American house spider, etc.). Presumably they get some kind of benefit from this. And, from what I've read, it isn't really a parasitical relationship, because they generally don't carry diseases, and the threat of spider bites to humans, especially from the common house-spider species, is quite small.

But, is it a symbiotic relationship? I can imagine some reasons it might be: dwellings with a larger population of spiders in the vicinity might have lower populations of pest insects, which might lead to less spoilage of food, lower rates of insect-borne illnesses, etc. But I haven't found any solid evidence of that kind of benefit being demonstrated scientifically. In some brief searching on Google Scholar, the only studies I can find are on whether spiders can have positive effects on agriculture by controlling crop pests. Is there research on whether they can also have positive effects on residential health?"	t5_2qm4e	True

It seems that no matter how many times I try to alter my sleeping habits, I can never become a mornig person. Is there a biological basis for this, or are night owls just making excuses for their reddit addiction?

1362503455.0	19prr7	With current electricity production methods that are in use, how much greener is an all-electric car compared to a petroleum car?	thentertainer	1633	635	373	"Obviously a traditional petroleum car produces CO2 and other nasty gases, but if I plugged in a car, wouldn't some power plant be burning something else producing similar gases somewhere else in order to power the car? In this case, the only difference is where the fuel burns. Because I am primarily concerned with greenhouse gases, I am asking from a chemistry perspective.

From what I understand nuclear power only requires cores and cooling usually with water, though waste is a problem, so though not totally true could we assume that power from nuclear plants is pure and without side effects [for this question at least]? In the US nuclear power roughly accounts for 19% of all power production. Also in the US renewable energy accounted for 12.5% of power production in the US in 2012 apparently.

All these factors included, who wins the green fight?

This year my sixth period has LOTS of questions, and this was perhaps the most perplexing.  Perhaps someone can answer?

If you're curious, here are the rest of the questions from 6th period this week:

* What happens if you put water in lava?
* Why do people think that if you go to Bermuda triagle, weird things will happen or you'll go missing?
* Why do people on ghost shows use infrared cameras?
* How deep is it in the Death Valley?
* If you mixed liquid nitrogen and lava and toxic waste, what will happen?  If you can't answer that, only mix lava and liquid nitrogen.

* Can you find my Iphone?
* What is the Coriolis Effect?

* How hot is lava?
* What happens if you put liquid nitrogen in lava?
* What happens if a bird flies to the top of Mount Everest?
* How do you get dry ice off?
* Where would you buy dry ice?

I love teaching science!

THANK YOU so much for all of your responses!  We are going to have such a great 6th period today.  I'm just blown away that so many people took the time to respond, and I can't wait to share your information with my class.  I also think the students are going to be really proud and amazed that experts took their questions seriously and took the time to respond (I'm anticipating a much fuller parking lot next week!).  I was only expecting people to tackle the title question; my expectations have been blown out of the water! 

I also love all the videos posted (especially the lava + ice, lava + garbage, and thermite + liquid nitrogen), and I'll definitely be sharing them.  

I just woke up after staying until 9:45 PM last night for back to school night; I'm sorry it's taken me so long to respond.   I'll take time during my planning period to read each response more carefully and prepare to blow my sixth periods' minds!

Middle school can be a tough age for so many kids, and I love encouraging curiosity in my class.  I hate seeing students get discouraged or disillusioned.   I think all of this will mean a *lot* to my students and really motivate them to keep asking questions.  Please private message me if you have any ideas about how to give credit in class to those who have helped.  "	t5_2qm4e	True

Ask us anything about our paper!	jjberg2	1435	459	148	"**Message from Graham and Peter: Thanks everyone for all of your great questions. We'll answer some of the pending questions, as of 1pm PT May 16th, but won't be answering new ones.  Thanks!**

We are the authors, Peter Ralph (/u/petrelharp) and Graham Coop
(/u/grahamcoop), of a recent paper on
[The Geography of Recent Genetic Ancestry across Europe](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001555).

The article made some news in
[a](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-european-dna-20130508,0,6298389.story)
[number](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/07/charlemagnes-dna-and-our-universal-royalty/)

[places](http://www.nature.com/news/most-europeans-share-recent-ancestors-1.12950)
with the headline that ""Europeans are all related"".  What does that
mean? Didn't we already know that?  And how can you show that the
Spanish and the Polish have the same ancestors only 1,000 years ago,
but also see different effects of events from 1,500 years ago in their
genomes?  We're ready to talk about genetics, genealogy, and even a
little bit of European history (Although note that we're not historians).

Here's a quick intro; there's more detail [here](http://gcbias.org/european-genealogy-faq/).

Few of us know our family histories more than a few generations back. It is therefore
easy to overlook the fact that we are all distant cousins, related to
one another via a vast network of relationships. 

In the paper we use
genome-wide data from European individuals to investigate these
relationships over the past 3,000 years, by looking for long stretches
of genome that are shared between pairs of individuals through their
inheritance from common genetic ancestors. We find evidence of
ubiquitous recent common ancestry, showing for instance that even
pairs of individuals from opposite ends of Europe share hundreds of
genetic common ancestors over this time period. 

Since the vast
majority of genealogical ancestors from 1,000 years ago are not
genetic ancestors, this implies that all of the Europeans in our
sample share nearly all of their genealogical ancestors only 1000
years ago (albeit to differing extents). Despite this degree of
commonality, there are also regional differences. Southeastern
Europeans, for example, share relatively more common ancestors that
date roughly to the era of the Slavic and Hunnic expansions around
1,500 years ago, while most common genetic ancestors that Italians
share with other populations lived longer than 2,500 years ago. The study of long stretches of shared genetic material promises to uncover
rich information about many aspects of recent population history.

Basically, they're saying that these are actual images of molecules. It seems to say that they're running something very tiny over the surface of the molecule, and creating a picture from the very minute vibrations detected.

So is this resulting image what a molecule actually ""looks"" like? Or is this more of a doctored representation like a lot of the compound space photos we see? For instance, I'm guessing that the bonds in this image are actually the resistance felt by the instrument, rather than actual lines.

Some context, my brother claims he saw the same thing the day before, while I was not home. He says it stuck to the cars, and it was massive. All over the yard, probably... 30-40 feet long chunks of this. Happened a few years ago, he didn't get any pictures. My father saw it too, neither had any idea what it was. They both said within about 20 minutes all of it disappeared, shrunk down to nothing. I went out to find some still in the yard after he told me (the next day) and saw this floating down.

I just found these on my old photobucket, and have no idea what they are, and would love to have some answers. I don't know what kind of material could possibly shrink up like this, or why it wasn't shrunken before it landed, because it was QUICK to shrink once I saw it.

1318855803.0	lf2dz	Introducing the first AskScience Fair!	foretopsail	1636	672	215	"**Welcome to the first Reddit AskScience Fair!**

You remember science fairs... a bunch of kids do science experiments, and present the results.  It's the same thing here, except on Reddit, hosted by [/r/AskScience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience)!  The Reddit admins have agreed to donate some awesome prizes, and AskScience will give you some sweet flair on our subreddit.

**Here's the deal (the short version):**

Create and run an experiment by November 28th at 11:59 PM!  This fair is all about *experiments*, not *demonstrations*.  Make sure you're answering a question, and make sure you remember to hypothesize.  Plan your experiment and complete it, making sure to spend no more than $40 US.  After your experiment is done, write it up!  Tell us what you did, what you learned, and what your conclusion is.  Make sure you sum up the whole project in a one-paragraph abstract, too!  Then post it to /r/asksciencefair, again by November 28th at 11:59 PM.  Make sure you do it before the deadline.  After some judging-time, we'll make a post with some awesome prizes!  Keep an eye out, because the AskScience panelists will be doing weekly workshops on Doing Science The Scientific Way (things like coming up with questions, making graphs, looking at data).  These workshops will be at /r/AskScienceFair.

*Be sure to join **[r/asksciencefair](http://www.reddit.com/r/asksciencefair)** and **[r/asksciencefairhelp](http://www.reddit.com/r/asksciencefairhelp)** to keep up-to-date with the latest AskScience Fair developments!*

**Here are some things you should include:**

Creativity!

DIY materials!

Testable ideas!

Graphs!  Pictures!  Analysis!

Friends or family! (Teams are ok, and so's doing it by yourself!)

**Here's the longer deal (make sure you read this too):**

* There's no age limit.

* There's no subject limit *per se*, but here are some things that aren't ok: Experiments with humans without their written consent aren't ok.  **Cruelty to animals or humans is absolutely not ok. If you want to do an animal experiment of any kind, modmail the /r/asksciencefair mods.**  Experiments that threaten community safety are not ok.  No experiments with DEA-controlled substances or potentially hazardous biological agents.

* Unless you need to ask us about whether an experiment is ok, there's no need to tell us what your experiment's going to be.

* If you need help, feel free to post on /r/asksciencefairhelp.  There are quite a few AskScience panelists who've volunteered to help out with questions.

* AskScience panelists are not eligible to compete.

* Judges are AskScience panelists who have agreed to help out on a volunteer basis.  *Their decisions are final*.

* While things you have lying around don't count as part of your $40 budget, keep in mind that following the spirit of the budget rule (intended to keep everyone on a level playing field) is a factor in scoring. Be creative!

* Judges might want some proof that you've stayed inside the cost limit.  Keep your receipts.

* Projects need to be posted as threads on /r/asksciencefair before **November 28th, at 11:59 PM Eastern time** to be considered.  No late submissions.

* Your project must be developed for THIS contest, not something you've been working on for 4 months already.

* Give us anything you want in terms of format (link to a picture, link to a PDF, link to a Google document, link to the past), but it must include an ""abstract"" at the beginning telling us briefly what you did and found. An abstract is a short paragraph or two summarizing the main points or important ideas presented in your project. 

* Try to avoid long youtube videos.  In fact, try and avoid presenting your project in youtube format at all, unless you feel it really adds something.

**Awards and Judging**:

When the deadline's passed, the projects will be randomly assigned to three judges each.  That way it's not the same panel dealing with each project, and there won't be as much effect from individual scoring styles.  Judges will be volunteer AskScience panelists.  Each project will be scored by the scoring rubric, and the top three projects by score will receive prizes.

Each judge will score projects to a maximum of 100 points, awarded as follows:

* Creativity - 30 points
* Scientific Thought - 30 points
* Rigor - 15 points
* Presentation - 25 points

Judges may post or PM questions to the entrants if they'd like further clarification.

In addition to the top three projects by score, there'll be a few **special awards**.  These are:

* Judges' Choice: Presented to a particularly creative or all-around well-executed project that might not have made it to the top three.

* Best Research Question: Presented to the project with a really well-formed and creative research question. **Thanks to kind redditor shaver, this prize now includes a $100 Amazon giftcard, along with a $100 donation to the science charity of your choice!**

* Best DIY Spirit: Presented to the project that best sticks to the spirit of the $40 limit - the ""Doing The Most With The Least"" award.

* Most Inventive Methods: Presented for ingenious investigative methods.

* Most Rigorous: Presented for best following the ideals of scientific rigor.

* Best Analysis: Presented for particularly fine analysis of data.

* Best Presentation: Awarded for excellent, clear, and impressive presentation of the experiment and results."	t5_2qm4e	True

Have you ever wondered what it's like to work at the cutting edge of physics, chemistry, and engineering? Today, our purple, blue, and red panelists will post about their adventures and advances in materials science! It's a field that aims to describe how materials behave and applications thereof. 

Maybe you're curious about:

* how to design new materials to target specific applications?
* how to understand matter at tiny length scales?
* how to measure things at extremes of temperature and pressure?

Maybe you'd really like a clarification on:

* nanotechnology?
* amorphous materials?
* phase transitions?

Perhaps you've thought about:

* how to make solar cells and night vision goggles? 
* how to use radiation to understand matter?
* how to get heat and energy to do work for us?

Sometimes there are interesting puzzles that need solving, like:

* what do wrinkles and folds have to do with responsive materials?
* what do magnets and superconductors have in common?
* what is special about thin films and membranes?

Let's try and get all of these questions answered and more!

Here's how today's AMA is going to work. Wait for a panelist to post a short description of their research, and then ask away! Ask follow-up questions if you don't understand something. That's part of the fun. If you're curious about what it's like to be a scientist or engineer, this is an excellent time to ask about it - feel free to ask what is on your mind!

It's been a while since we've had an opportunity to connect with you -- especially all you new subscribers joining us recently! To help you feel at home in this community, we wanted to clarify how we moderate AskScience and answer questions many of you have sent us via modmail.

Often, a collection of anecdotal posts in reddit lacks explanatory power because it is limited by selection bias. We frequently delete them because they are not grounded in established science, and they have a side effect of cluttering up threads. As a result, sometimes you'll see large blocks of deleted comments. We really do apologize for this as our goal is to keep threads clean and easily readable. We're limited by changes permitted by reddit's interface.

There have been many suggestions for us to put deleted comments in a viewable repository, or to leave them in place in a collapsed manner. Please know that the purpose of deleting comments also stems from the desire to avoid propagating misinformation, very often originating from layman speculation. In recent times, we've been more active with removing bad posts and reposts to strike what we believe is a meaningful balance of scientific content for everyone. If you see a comment or post that is abusive, non-scientific, or off topic, please report them. It helps tremendously with keeping AskScience running smoothly and enjoyable to browse. Please feel free to share with us your thoughts about how we remove threads in the comments section below.

When submitting a new question, remember to add flair immediately afterwards to help attract knowledgeable persons to them! To do this, click on the “flair” link that appears right after your question is posted. Reddit's automated spam filter is very hungry -- if your question is not in the new queue within 5-10 minutes, please let us know via modmail. We're here to help release it, or reword it to draw more attention.

We're always trying to make AskScience the best scientific question forum on the internet, and it’s all you excellent people that guide it along. Please, tell us what is on your mind! How do you feel about the AskScience community? How are we moderators doing? We'd like to listen to your ideas and get a sense of what you would like AskScience to be.

Finally, remember to subscribe and stay tuned for some exciting side projects and ideas we've got in the works. Until then, thanks so much for your readership, and thanks for keeping AskScience awesome!
TL;DR: You're all awesome. Keep clicking the report buttons: no anecdotes, no layman speculation, add flair to your questions!

Hi Reddit, 

So, I have been lurking for some time, but I have no where else to turn. I have been trying to melt glass without bubbles for some time, and I just can't figure it out!!!!!! I have spent over a year and thousands of dollars. I am trying to make a small business, though now it is just a hobby because of this issue. 

I have a furnace that can reach 2100F or 1150C as a working temperature. I have kept the glass at that temperature for 12 hours, and there were bubbles everywhere. 

If I get the advice I need I will make something using this kiln, and ship it to them for free---&gt; and it is up to you what you want me to make. 

I have no clue why this doesn't work!!! annealing is no problem, but the bubbles are.

Should I use a vacuum furnace? If so, I ""can"" buy one, as I know it will be cost prohibitive in the long run to ""rent""/oem this stuff. I am just curious if the vacuum will still have these bubbles in the glass. Also, what temperature does it need to be at and how long? or really if a vacuum furnace WOULD work?

I spent a lot of money on this. I first built 2 furnaces, they were a disaster, then i bought another one that can reach those temperatures 2100F and 1150C, was crazy expensive, but my still work for the 2nd process if the vacuum furnace works. 

Please help!

Edit: should also add that I do not use large pieces, rather small pieces, the warmglass website about stacking would not work

Edit 2: not sure why i got a downvote, but from what i know askscience should be downvoted if it is not a scientific question. this is not ask google (which i googled for months), but a hardcore brain scratching question.
 thanks

This weeks topic came by a suggestion so I'm now going to quote part of the message for context:

As a high school science teacher I have to deal with misconceptions on many levels. Not only do pupils come into class with a variety of misconceptions, but to some degree we end up telling some lies just to give pupils some idea of how reality works (Terry Pratchett et al even reference it as necessary ""lies to children"" in the Science of Discworld books).

So the question is: which misconceptions do people within your field(s) of science encounter that you find surprising/irritating/interesting? To a lesser degree, at which level of education do you think they should be addressed?

Again please follow all the usual rules and guidelines.

As our subreddit grows (56 thousand!), we have to figure out new ways of doing things to make sure we keep the community feeling we all enjoy.

A lot of people have noticed that the speculation levels around here are at an all-time high. 

* We'd like to remind folks that discussion should be centered around scientific answers to questions. Responses directly to the original post, ""top-level comments,"" should either be an answer from some scientific source or a question on the topic at hand. Please feel free to ask questions about the subject at any level, and hopefully someone can help provide you some answers. If you're posting a response that attempts to answer a question, it should answer it scientifically. If you're an expert in the field, please say so, or get a panelist tag here to help identify you. If you're not an expert, that's okay too, but please provide citations from some source that is respected scientifically.  Also, try and refrain from anecdotes and ""me too"" posts, especially in the top-level comments. 

Sometimes users who know about the subject might not be around. That doesn't mean it's ok to make something up. It's ok not to know, it's ok for a scientist not to know, it's ok for the entire scientific community not to know. But if you do know, or you can point to a source that backs up what you're saying, post away!

* Another topic people bring up a lot is the subject of questions on AskScience.  Some folks feel they're too unscientific, some folks are concerned about the amount of downvotes questions get (many questions hover around 0 karma, never to be seen unless you head to /new/).  Not all questions belong here.  Questions asking for medical advice, for instance.  You should never take medical advice from the Internet.  

We're not quite sure why people downvote questions, there are likely a lot of reasons.  One thing we hear is that sometimes questions are unscientific.

'Scientific' isn't synonymous with 'every variable is controlled' nor does it have to mean 'requires a control group'. Science is a socially-engaged method of methodically exploring the world around us. How you define those words is a very personal thing, as is how each person defines science. Scientists and the public vary widely as to their exact views and where they 'draw the line'. There is not one single 'science', and so there are going to be a wide variety of 'scientific' questions.  Science is a very big tent, as evidenced by the wide variety of panelist tags in AskScience.  Many people (and many scientists!) have a very numbers/data driven view of science.  But we'd like to remind people that this isn't the only way that one can do science.  Scientists also use social methods (discourse, discussion, argument, peer review) in addition to their empirical methods.  One can be scientific and do naturalistic, theoretical, and/or qualitative research (i.e. not all science has numbers).

* **Extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence, however**, and that's where we come back to speculation.  It seems to be an especially big concern with social science questions. Every one of the moderators agrees that social science questions and social science panelists are heartily welcome here. Unfortunately, some of the readers seem to disagree. That's one of the things that prompted this discussion of downvotes. Social science is science, as long as it's conducted scientifically. And those questions are welcomed and encouraged. Again, science is a very big tent, and it has lots of people doing amazing things that don't even occur to people outside their little niche. In other words, while evolution and cosmology are really interesting, so are a whole lot of other things. So ask that wild question! Look through the panelist tags to see what they're doing, and see if you have any questions! If you don't know what to ask, ask them if they'll do an AskScience AMA. Do remember, though, that the same guidelines apply for social science questions as any other question - **avoid speculation. Provide sources.**

If you see something in a thread that you don't think helps the community answer questions, go ahead and click that report button!  We have a new tool that notifies all the mods whenever something's been reported or the spam filter's got stuff in it, so we're a much more efficient crew these days.  Reporting's a big help, because there are enough comments that no one could possibly look at them all.  Plus, it's anonymous, in case you're worried about that sort of thing!

Finally, what do you think?  Are you happy with the community?  Air your opinions in this thread!

Star Trek, a particular favorite of mine, shows ships like the Enterprise or Voyager traveling with the engines engaged all the time when the ship is moving.

From what little I know about how the space shuttle works, they fire their boosters/rockets/thrusters etc. only when necessary to move or adjust orbit through controlled ""burns,"" then cut the engines. Thrust is only provided when needed, and usually at brief intervals. Granted the shuttle is not moving across galaxies, but hopefully for the purposes of this question on propulsion this fact is irrelevant and the example still stands. 

So how should these movie vessels be portrayed when moving? Wouldn't they be able to fire up their warp/impulse engines, attain the desired speed, then cut off engines until they need to stop?

Here are the responses I've gotten so far:

Steel seems to be the best choice because of it's ability to be tempered differently in different parts of the sword. There are suggestions for L6/Banite, 4130, 300M. I don't know enough to say which is best.

Lets say somehow, someway we manage to make it to an earth like planet and it can support life but it has twice the amount of gravity than the earth, would humans be able to safely travel around the planet?
(I pretty much have no clue what I am talking about so if this question makes absolutely no sense, please inform me! It's super interesting!)

To add a little more information that I've read is that the human body can withstand two/three times gravity of earth, but for how long? long exposure sounds like it would be bad.

The speed of sound at sea level is 340 m/s.

This would normally mean that the bullet hits you before you hear the gunshot, but I reckon it won't, as the acceleration of the bullet isn't fast enough to start travelling before you hear the gunshot, at short distance.

But how far would the bullet need to travel to outrun the sound of the gunshot?

If the 9mm handgun isn't powerful enough to ever cause this, maybe we can consider a [sniper round](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7.62%C3%9751mm_NATO), which travels at 833.0 m/s (2,733 ft/s)."	t5_2qm4e	True

ApatheticElephant	1421	559	376	"I hope this isn't a silly question with an obvious answer, but it's something that I thought of recently which I can't figure out. If one object lies within another's gravitational field, they will move towards eachother, right? But of course, for any object to move, it requires energy. And that energy has to come from somewhere. But where does it come from in this case?

To use the real-life example that made me wonder this. There's a clock in my lounge room which is one of those old-fashioned style one that uses weights. As the weight is pulled down to the earth by gravity, it moves the gears in the clock to make the clockwork operate. Every now and then you have to reset the weight when it gets to the bottom of the chain. But aside from that, it just seems like you're pulling energy to power the clock out of nowhere.

This feels like something that should have an easy enough answer that I ought to know, but I can't figure it out. Can someone explain this to me?

And as a secondary question, if we built a spacecraft today with a similar mission, How would our current communications technology impact transmission distances to these new spacecraft? Would they work for significantly further distances, or is there some other limiting factor?

I practice in one of the largest trauma centers in North America, with a full pediatric emergency suite as well.  I've dabbled in a few other areas of the hospital, and occasionally cover some ICU positions if others require time off.

I'm especially familiar with ventilators and mode selection and treatment of asthma and respiratory illness in general.

The rest of our green panelists have graciously offered to help answer the questions I can't here, so please be gracious towards them as well if I can't answer for you.

1347891144.0	100to0	The process of reading math	rohanman	1220	408	131	"I struggled in college with higher math. However, I made it through. Today I work in engineering and still struggle. I figure I am probably not alone with my challenges. I read a lot of technical papers and find that many writers tend to ""write with math"". This is horrifying to me every time I turn the page to see no words - just endless equations. Usually following these equations is a declaration of ""...in conclusion, you can clearly see that..."". I also hate it when authors neglet to define variables. 

My question is, what is your process for reading these equations? I tend to look for familiar similar equations and get the context but that is about all I do before getting bored and moving on. Please help me get better at reading math. Was there a course that you took that taught these skills that I slept through?

EDIT:Wow…great suggestions. Thanks so much. Here are the most helpful comments: 
Take notes, decompose the equation, read it over slowly again and again…take your time. The equations are there for precision, words (prose) are there to introduce, conclude. Practice. Practice. Practice. Understand the variables. Run the equations with the variables at 0, infinity, etc to find out what happens.

It seems that engineers suck at writing. I would humbly suggest that perhaps we should try to improve that in the engineering field.

For instance if I take a bar of aluminum and I pull on it (applying a tensile load) it will eventually yield if I pull hard enough meaning there's some permanent deformation in the bar. This means if I take the load off the bar its length is now different than before I pulled on it. 

If there are answers to some of these questions, I'm curious what they are:

* Does space experience stress and strain like conventional materials do? 

* Does it have a stiffness? Moreover, does space act like a spring, mass, damper, multiple, or none of the above?

* Can you yield space -- if there was a mass large enough (like a black hole) and it eventually dissolved, could the space have a permanent deformation like a signature that there used to be a huge mass here? 

* Can space shear?

* Can space buckle?

* Can you actually tear space? Science-fiction tells us yes, but what could that really mean? Does space have a failure stress beyond which a tear will occur?

* Is space modeled better as a solid, a fluid, or something else? As an engineer, we sort of just ignore its presence and then add in effects we're worried about."	t5_2qm4e	True

This core generates a powerful magnetic ""shield"", that diverts much of the solar wind around, and away from our planet. 

Without it, I once heard that the solar wind would strike, and eliminate our atmosphere in a few million years, give or take. 

Mars, for example, has no molten iron core, and a fleetingly thin atmosphere. So Mars probably lost it's atmosphere and a lot of water, because it lacks a molten liquid iron core.

If this is true, how then does Saturn's moon Titan get to keep it's atmosphere? 

Is it because it is much further from the sun? 

Even if it's further away, I would have thought that there is still a significant and steady solar wind at Saturn, that would eventually strip away a smaller body's atmosphere? 

I also suspect Titan, like Mars, is too small to have a liquid iron core right now, unless, again, I'm mistaken? "	t5_2qm4e	True

Edit: Another question I just thought of: Obviously being made of matter we could never visit it, but does anti-matter have the properties necessary to make stars and trees and tangible macro-objects?? could there theoretically be anti-matter life?

Edit #2: So let me see if I have my head around it. The two theories are either A) it just happened that more matter was created than antimatter or B) Matter --&gt; antimatter vs matter--&gt; opposite but equal matter is not perfectly symmetrical (this is what my understand of CP violation, not sure if thats correct. Also is the symmetry that the spin and charge are not perfectly equal but opposite or is it that the actual masses expected are not what are observed ) and for some reason the equilibrium is slightly tilted in matter's favor. If this is the case, could it be that anti-nutrino's from neutrons becoming proton's, electrons and anti-nutrino's dont react with matter because they have no mass so that the expected discrepancy is actually just a whole bunch of anti-nutrino's that dont react with normal matter? Im a chem major with no true teaching in physics or quarks/quantum mechanics so this could be completely off. I just find this stuff fascinating.

NeoDestiny	1556	801	358	"It seems like it would be in the best interest of a virus or pathogen to make its host stronger, as it would allow itself (the infection) to spread more easily due to the longer lifespan/increased physical ability of the host.

Say, in a closed system, you had 1,000 animals, and 2 prevailing diseases.  One of them killed you within 6 hours of infection, the other one boosted your physical abilities by 50%.  It seems that the dying animals would be much less likely to live long enough to pass on the disease than the other more fit animals.

Why hasn't natural selection given us diseases that help us?

From what I understand the explanation for what causes a person to stop procrastinating, if procrastination is a habit, is a sort of economics of reward vs risk.

But since water is essential to life and our planet is mostly covered with it I would expect the current situation to be reversed. I mean, most intelligent life forms live in the sea and occasionally delve onto land, may be to mine for minerals or hunt some land animals.

Why isn't it so?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses. Makes complete sense that intelligence is not what I think it is. The aquati life forms are surviving just fine which I guess is the main point. I was thinking about more than just survival though. We humans have a large enough to understand even evolution itself. That is the kind of growth that we are ourselves trying to find else where in the universe. So yes a fish is able to be a fish just fine but that is not what I have in mind.

I was taught your standard, fundy, beliefs; went to a Christian high school etc. I have recently (within the last year) defected from the ""6 days of creation"" theory, and taken on the ""macro evolution, billion year old earth"" theory. I find there to be too much evidence supporting the latter for me to continue believing in a young earth.

On to my very ignorant question. We have evolved from apes (probably wrong here on some level, but leave discussing this for another topic, unless I am completely wrong and its relevant).  From what I understand, apes turned into humans and we got smarter - smart enough to create cities and planes and medicine and space ships. 

My question is this. Why have apes evolved into humans, but we do not see other races of evolved, intelligent beings that have come from other animals? Why is there no higher level, intelligent life underwater that has evolved from dolphins or some sort of fish? Why do we not have intelligent life that can fly, evolved from birds? Is this something that could have once happened, and have since died off, or something that will happen soon, after we are all gone?  This is all very new to me, and I feel as though I am playing catch up for 23 years of life and any insight will be most appreciated.

1342948912.0	wymrf	Is penis size 100% genetic, or could it be affected by environmental factors?		1492	825	219	"Clarification: Do chemicals entering from the environment, either into the mother or the infant's bodies, affect penis size? / Could things like exercising, or masturbating, or eating certain foods, or anything else like that (presumably before or during puberty) cause the release of chemicals which encourage/discourage penis growth?

edit: Remember, this is /r/askscience: There are plenty of other places on the internet where you can make dick jokes or speculate about the possible size of my penis. Solid scientific answers only please.

edit2: Can anyone with the relevant medical knowledge answer an [interesting question was brought up down the page](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wymrf/is_penis_size_100_genetic_or_could_it_be_affected/c5hph0n) on the subject of ""jelqing"" (which I would potentially consider to be an ""environmental factor"" which affects penis size, if it *does* actually affect penis size): Skin, muscle, vasculature and even ligaments to a small extent can be slowly stretched to longer lengths through time. Is there something structural about the penis that would prevent it being stretched in the same way? i.e. Is it theoretically possible for techniques like jelqing and stretching of the penis to increase its size?"	t5_2qm4e	True

Or is this more tied into your DNA?

I'd assume this would likely take more than a couple months if true?  I work at a historical plantation and I wondered whether those that lived before AC in the 1700-1800s, and all historical civs, dealt with such heat.  Was their bodies more accumulated to the climate?

LuklearFusion	954	318	385	"Hi everyone, we are BugeyeContinuum, mdreed, a_dog_named_bob, LuklearFusion, and qinfo, and we all work in Quantum Computing and/or Quantum Information. Please ask us anything!

P.S.: Other QIP panelists are welcome to join in the fun, just post a short bio similar to the ones below, and I'll add it up here :).

To get things started, here's some more about each of us:

BugeyeContinuum majored in physics as undergrad, did some work on quantum algorithms for a course, and tried to help a chemistry optics lab looking to diversify into quantum info set up an entanglement experiment. Applied to grad schools after, currently working on simulating spin chains, specifically looking at quenching/annealing and perhaps some adiabatic quantum computation. Also interested in quantum biology, doing some reading there and might look to work on that once present project is done.

mdreed majored in physics as an undergrad, doing his senior thesis on magnetic heterostructures and giant magentoresistance (with applications to hard drive read-heads.) He went to grad school immediately after graduating, joining a quantum computing lab in the first semester and staying in it since. He is in his final year of graduate school, and expects to either get a job or postdoc in the field of quantum information.

LuklearFusion did his undergrad in Mathematical Physics, with his senior research project on quantum chaos. He's currently 6 months away from a M.Sc. in Physics, studying the theory behind devices built from superconducting qubits and hybrid systems. He is also fairly well versed in quantum foundations (interpretations of quantum mechanics) and plans on pursuing this in his PhD research. He is currently applying to grad schools for his PhD, if anyone is interested in that kind of thing. He is also not in a North American timezone, so don't get mad at him if he doesn't answer you right away.

qinfo is a postdoc working in theoretical quantum information, specifically in quantum error correction, stabilizer states and some aspects of multi-party entanglement."	t5_2qm4e	True

**My question is:** How does that other 2% of women become pregnant if they are using condoms perfectly? Are all these pregnancies due to obvious condom failure (breakage/slippage), or are there ways a condom can fail without it being obvious? What proportion of these pregnancies are due to non-obvious condom failure?

The reason I'm asking is this: if a condom breaks or slips, it's still possible to use a non-invasive method like Plan B to stop the pregnancy. However, if a condom fails ""silently"", the only option left is abortion (which is much more expensive, invasive, and traumatizing).

I'd prefer you cite a source in answering this question.

**EDIT:** I am aware of the fact that condoms can fail by breaking or slipping even if used correctly. I am wondering whether the 2% risk of pregnancy is entirely accounted for by breakage or slippage, or whether there is some other mechanism by a which someone can get pregnant even if the condom is used correctly, does not break open, and does not slip.

**Edited to update for second rock**

So I cut, polished, and etched the second rock.

Interior matrix is far different than the iron slag rock.

Here are images of the various steps.

While I may slowly be resigning to the fact that this is a terrestrial construct, I do believe that the last chance that it may have of being from space is if it is an *Ataxite Meteorite.*

So what do you think I have? Is it worth taking a next step or have I reached the end of the line?

Thanks for everyones help, honest opinions, and cold hard scientific knowledge!

**-**













While searching for rocks on my property to make a flower bed wall, I came across two very unusual rocks, one of which I have (what I believe to be) strong evidence for being an iron meteorite. The other, while it does have some characteristics of being a meteorite, it also has a stronger chance of being more terrestrial in nature (I'll explain more below).

I did some research on meteorite identification and did some tests and have some numbers that may help.

I hope the sages at r/askscience can help offer some scientific input into my findings!

**Meteorite candidate 1:**

This was the first one I found. Immediately I was amazed at how heavy and dense the rock felt for it's size - it felt as if I was picking up a solid chunk of iron.

The rock was about 3/4 of the way buried and there was no evidence of a crater or indentation. Upon first inspection, there appeared to be no evidence of a fusion crust; however there were many layers of 'rust flakes' which came off.

**Size and weight:** 

Roughly 5 in x 4 in x 4 in (12.7 cm x 10.16 cm x 10.16 cm) with an approximate volume of 80 in^3 (1311 cm^3)

9.8 lbs (4.4 kg)

**The Magnet test**

[Various magnets of different strengths \(from Neodymium rare earth to extremely weak fridge magnets\) stuck with great strength. 
](http://i.imgur.com/BqIrG.jpg)


**Approximate density test**

[As previously stated, the weight \(mass\) of the object is 4.4kg (9.8lbs).](http://i.imgur.com/iQ9wg.jpg)

Using a variety of mixing bowls and pitchers I had, I was able to use water-displacement to approximate the density of the rock. The results aren't that precise (due to the measuring devices being only so accurate), but are close enough approximation.

In 3 seperate containers, the averaged amount of water displaced was approximately 3/4 of a liter (about 25 ounces).

Basic volume formula is mass/volume, so:

4.4kg/25.4oz = 6.11 g/cm^3 

(doing 4.4 kg/ .75l gives you 5.86 g/cm^3)

So depending on what system of measurement you use the density falls between 5.8-6.1 g/cm^3

Now t[his chart illustrates common densities of meteorites](http://meteorites.wustl.edu/id/density.htm) - and it seems that there is a jump from stony-iron meteorites (in the 4s) to iron meteorites (which are in the 7-8s). 

These two charts give the specific gravity/density of many minerals.
[
Chart 1](http://www.reade.com/Particle_Briefings/spec_gra.html)

[Chart 2](http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_materials.htm)

And the closest match to what I have are Gallium, Lanthanum, and Vanadium.  

And to help rule out a man-made metal slag - iron ore slag is between 2-3 and hardened steel/iron is above 7.

** Meteorite Candidate 2 **

This rock may or may not be terrestrial in origin. It does display many of the same characteristics of the other rock (density, magnetism, et al) and of meteorites, but it very well could also be an earth rock (although a very rare kind).

I live in Rhode Island, and here we have a very interesting unique rock, known as [Cumberlandite](http://www.shgresources.com/ri/symbols/rock/). This particular element only exists in a four acre patch and is not found anywhere else on Earth. It does contain primarily magnetite, titanium, and olivine (as well as other minerals).

Now I have been to the mine, and I have taken my own pieces of [Cumberlandite](http://www1.newark.ohio-state.edu/Professional/OSU/Faculty/jstjohn/Cumberlandite/Cumberlandite.htm), but they do not look like this particular rock I have.

6.[ Image 6](http://i.imgur.com/jAT6x.jpg)

7.[ Image of mass](http://i.imgur.com/EiIuS.jpg) (interestingly enough the same mass as the other object)

This one did pass the magnet test as well (although I don't have an image for it)

And the density was:

(4.4 kg) / (5.25 US cups) = 3.54 g / m3

And the density of [Cumberlandite](http://www.francesjane.com/cumberlandite.html) is 3.82-3.88 g/m^3


So those are my rocks! If anyone here on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) can help me ID them that would be great. 

Or if anyone knows of anywhere close to me that could do an analysis for me, if you think I may have something of interest.

Thanks!

However, I can't for the life of me see why this would be the case - on the road, its usually riskier when it is still raining and there is more water on the road surface. I would have expected a similar effect for trains, but the opposite seems to occur!

&gt;Astrophysicists had long theorized that when a star explodes, most of its energy is released as neutrinos—low-mass, subatomic particles that fly through planets like bullets through tissue paper. Part of the theory is that in the early phase of this type of explosion, the only ob- servable evidence is a shower of such particles; it then takes another few hours for the inferno to emerge as visible light. As a result, scien- tists predicted that when a star went supernova near us, we’d detect the neutrinos about three hours before we’d see the burst in the visible spectrum. (p58)

If the neutrinos arrived hours before the light of the supernova, it seems like that should be a clear indicator of neutrinos possibly traveling faster than light.

First of all, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hdal5/questions_to_scientists_from_6th_graders_also/) is pure magic.  It's everything /r/AskScience should strive to be:

* Interesting (*and simple!*) questions.

* Top-voted answers are thorough explanations by qualified individuals, in language that *everybody* understands.

That's it! It *really* is that simple. That's all we want and ask for. So **thank you** to everybody who made that post what it is.

Quick note, though: please respect everybody's right to privacy, stay on topic, and keep it clean. There **are** kids on the internet, and this is a place they should be visiting, and we want the parents to *want* to have their kids browse /r/AskScience. So please keep that in mind.


Secondly, **we win the internet!**: [we are now more popular than /r/4chan](/r/4chan)! It's an arbitrary and silly milestone, but I think it says a lot about /r/AskScience in particular, and about Reddit as a whole. The internet doesn't *have* to be horrible. It can be a beautiful place, instead.

1334258248.0	s6mob	I am swimming in a pool of water on the moon. How will the lower gravity affect the way I can swim?	tim_the_herbologist	1031	430	159	"Assume I am in a 1 atm chamber so I can breathe freely and there is a large pool. Does the lower gravity change the rate at which I would float and sink in the water? Would the pressure of the water as I go down be affected such that I could dive deeper or swim up to the surface faster or more easily?

EDIT 1: I just want to clear this up. Assume I am in a pressurized, heated colony and am using the colony's olympic swimming pool (25 X 50 X 2.5 metres), so I can swim about as far or as deep as I would like to and do not need supplemental oxygen.

EDIT 2: Thanks everyone for your great input. Here are some of the best answers and points I've read.

• Buoyancy stays the same, but the effect of gravity is less strong, so I would oscillate in the water more severely up and down if I were treading water. Waves will be much higher because of this, causing a potential drowning hazard. 

• [shiningPate](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s6mob/i_am_swimming_in_a_pool_of_water_on_the_moon_how/c4bsu0q) had a good point about the ease of moving out of the water like a penguin or dolphin, but my physical buoyancy will not change, just the thrust required to exit the water.

• The thread following [madnote's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s6mob/i_am_swimming_in_a_pool_of_water_on_the_moon_how/c4bjs7h) explains that viscosity or ease of motion through the water is a major 

• The pressure differences are fairly negligible due to the fact that the Moon's gravity is only about ⅙ that of Earth. At the bottom of the swimming pool at 2.5 metres, the pressure would be similar to about 0.42 m on Earth, but if I were in a much deeper pool, I could dive down more like 30 m and be affected as much as going down  5 m on earth

• Also, [condorcet_winner](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/s6mob/i_am_swimming_in_a_pool_of_water_on_the_moon_how/c4bp3vh) asks an interesting question that I would like to see answered. "	t5_2qm4e	True

Although I don't do any work on food production, it seems common sense that we would want to genetically modify our food to produce the traits we want, and not the ones we don't. This seems like a no-brainer. 

So why is there so much controversy over GMOs? Is it actually a controversy over the practice itself? Is it a controversy over the practices employed by the corporations making GMOs? 

If it's the former, I can't help but categorize the anti-GMO people as ignorant and impulsive. If it's the latter, why can't we frame the debate as anti-Monsanto rather than anti-GMO?

On Instagram this morning I saw that a friend of mine recently got a tattoo of the chemical structure of _dopamine_.

Now, I’m not entirely sure why, but I decided to look dopamine up on Wikipedia to ‘fact check’ things, only to find that his tattoo and what is shown on Wikipedia are subtly but definitely different. I also decided to get a third opinion from Wolfram Alpha, which gives the same as Wikipedia.

* His tattoo: http://i.imgur.com/XGl8bX1.jpg
* Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dopamine2.svg
* Wolfram Alpha: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Dopamine

Interestingly, a Google Image search for dopamine does yield what I imagine to have been the same image he took to the tattoo artist: http://assets.openstudy.com/updates/attachments/513c2f1ae4b01c4790d24e4d-easyuser-1362926137205-dopamine_chemical_structure.png

My questions, predictably, are:

* Is his tattoo dopamine? If not…
* What is it? And…
* Is that even remotely close to dopamine?

Depending on the answers, I guess I need to decide how, if at all, to tell him…

Thanks!

However there are also people who cast serious doubt on the epidemiological studies and meta analysis, but these people generally get dismissed as industry shills

One of the people who doubts the harmfulness has written this seemingly quite convincing defense of his claims:

&gt; [Defending legitimate epidemiologic research: combating Lysenko pseudoscience](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1742-5573/4/11)

&gt; This analysis presents a detailed defense of my epidemiologic research in the May 17, 2003 British Medical Journal that found no significant relationship between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and tobacco-related mortality. In order to defend the honesty and scientific integrity of my research, I have identified and addressed in a detailed manner several unethical and erroneous attacks on this research. 

I really don't know who to believe as both sides of the issue have become powerful groups with their own vested interests and lobbies. What does askscience make of this?

*Thanks for all the input and discussion. It's seems to be more controversial than I thought. While I'm convinced that second hand smoke obviously isn't healthy I'm still not sure that it is damaging enough to justify a ban in public spaces due to health concerns. I doubt there can be a satisfactory study any time soon and think it will remain similar to how radiation [or asbestos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#Environmental_asbestos) are seen.

We're continuously growing, and that means there are more and more people who are new to /r/AskScience.  For the most part, I'm happy to see all the traffic. I see lots of really interesting and novel questions, and many really awesome scientific responses, from both old-timers and newcomers. 

However, the amount of non-science commenting is (again) on the rise, so I ask *all* of you: please think before you submit!

Try not to comment if you do not know how to scientifically back up what you are saying. Asking a question, or simply up-or-downvoting is most often a much better way of interacting with and contributing to the community. We're trying to run a valuable service here, please help us keep it as awesome and on-target as it has been in the past.

For example:

* Bad: I'm not a physicist but if I had to guess I'd say that the magnets would fly off...

* Good: According to my understanding, the magnets would fly off because of the [redacted] principle. Is this correct?

RiseOtto	1187	591	286	"I figured that there might be some places on this earth where depth is irrelevant, maybe on some liquid surface some small creatures are floating around in a world similar to the Plato ""cave experiment"" ( en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave). Are there any such creatures?

EDIT: Question depends on definition of perceiving, I'll try to clarify what I was intrigued by. 

For example, imagine a species living on a liquid surface. The individuals will be very flat and unable to dive, jump or even wobble back and forth. Their food and reproduction will be handled on surface-level, just as the rest of their lives. To those creatures, what happens in the third dimension would be totally irrelevant, and thus evolution might ""remove their perception of the third dimension"". I guess what I'm asking is; are there any creatures that operate only in two dimensions, and that care so little about dimension n.3 that Darwin/Plato just as well could steal their understanding of three dimensions? I imagine that it would be hard for us humans to prove that ""this and this species are just as 2D as Mario"".

Supersnazz	1141	549	359	"Falling into water from a great height, say an aeroplane or helicopter, is going to be fatal due to the rapid deceleration. 

But what if that person was somehow encased in a large body of water that was also falling at the same speed as the human? When the falling water blob hit the surface and the person began deceleration, he would already be in the water, so there would be no surface to suddenly break his fall, rather he'd just be moving and deceleration through an existing body of water. Even if it couldn't save his life, would there be ANY benefit to already being in a falling body of water?

Ignore breathing issues, or the difficulty in keeping him in the blob as it falls (assume some sort of rubber membrane which bursts and disappears on impact).

EDIT - Judging by the responses below it is clear that whilst some people are making educated statements based on fact, a sizable portion of people have absolutely no idea what they are talking about and are essentially making up bullshit. The problem is I don't know which comment is which.

**edit:** [bra-fitting guide](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/How-to_determine_bra_size), which may be helpful in figuring out bra function


Throwaway, as this is a somewhat embarrassing subject.

**Question:**

There are women who can carry 15kg objects in their arms all day (taking frequent breaks) without experiencing back pain. However, if those same women do without a bra, leaving their 2.5kg breasts unsupported, they experience backaches in their lower and mid-spine within the hour. Why is this? Why do their backs not grow strong enough over time to support this weight? Also, how exactly does a bra redistribute force such that breasts no longer cause back pain?

Please don't brush this off as trolling; many people suffer severe medical problems as a result of poorly-supported breasts, and so any answers which may help educate people on this topic are greatly appreciated. (Full disclosure: My aunt, whose breasts appear to be roughly 2.5kg, experienced early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine, possibly due to very unsupportive bras--the very weight of her own breasts may have induced severe trauma/injury to the cartilage between her vertebrae. I am also a female with 2.5kg breasts, and am concerned about developing this condition.)

* I will also answer academic questions concerning forces experienced in all three scenarios. (Answers will be both anecdotal and qualitative.)

**Suppositions/Possible Factors:**

* Range of motion experienced when carrying a heavy object is more limited (only standing, walking, squatting).
* Breaks are taken when carrying a heavy object to allow time to recover.
* When carrying a heavy object, muscles of the arm, back, and shoulders are involved. With breasts, only muscles of the back and shoulders are involved.
* For easier analysis, could the force distribution on a bra be comparable to the force distribution on a high-set backpack, worn front-ways, with [the sternum strap](http://www.thinktankphoto.com/product-images/xlarge/Feature-Rotation-360-15.jpg) fastened tightly?

Insects do not seem to exhibit this trait in any way, despite the fact that most people regularly kill them on sight (either individually or on an extermination level when near homes).

**Please make a comment to this thread to join our panel of scientists. (click the reply button) **

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are professional scientists (or plan on becoming one, with at least a **graduate-level familiarity** with the field of their choice).

You may want to join the panel if you:

* Are a research scientist, or are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences.

* Are able to write about your field at a layman's level as well as at a level comfortable to your colleagues and peers (depending on who's asking the question)

You're still reading? Excellent! Please reply to this thread with the following:

* Choose **one** general field from the side-bar. If you have multiple specialties, you still have to choose one.

* State your specific field (neuropathology, quantum chemistry, etc.)

* List your particular area of research (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a synopsis of your education: have you been a post-doctoral research scientist for three decades, or are you a first-year PhD student?

* Link us to one or two comments you've made in /r/AskScience, which *you* feel are indicative of your scholarship. If you haven't commented yet, then please wait to apply. We'd prefer it if the comments have a reference, so we can more easily check if it's B.S. without specific domain knowledge.

We're not going to do background checks - we're just asking for Reddit's best behavior here. The information you provide will be used to compile a list of our panel members and what subject areas they'll be ""responsible"" for.

The reason I'm asking for comments to this post is that I'll get a little orange envelope from each of you, which will help me keep track of the whole thing. These official threads are also here for book-keeping: the other moderators and I can check what your claimed credentials are, and can take action if it becomes clear you're bullshitting us.

*Addendum:* Please don't give us too much of your personal details. We don't need it, we don't even want it; please be careful and maintain your reddit/internet privacy. Thanks!

**Bonus points!** Here's a good chance to discover people that share your interests! And if you're interested in something, you probably have questions about it, so you can get started with that in /r/AskScience.

1369613440.0	1f3x5j	Do animals see television screens as having nonsensical colours? How does the number and responsive range of cones in the eye affect the way the light is added to produce colours?	dxinteractive	845	278	57	"As I've read, the human eye has three cones that respond to the [following wavelengths of light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision#Cone_cells_in_the_human_eye):
&gt; * S, range 400–500 nm, peak wavelength 420–440 nm
&gt; * M, range 450–630 nm, peak wavelength 534–555 nm
&gt; * L, range 500–700 nm, peak wavelength 564–580 nm

Further down on the wiki page it explains that in different animals with trichromatic colour vision, the ranges that each cone responds to are often different, and obviously dichromatic and tetrachromatic animals will see things differently again.

And if the process for television screens goes like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color#Examples)...
&gt; * Light source - Green (medium wavelength) light and red (long wavelength) light radiate from two different projectors.
&gt; * Projection screen - Both the green and the red light reflect off of a spot on the screen.
&gt; * Retina - The mixed light activates the M and L cones on a spot on the retina about equally.
&gt; * Brain - The brain interprets the equal amounts of M and L signal as yellow.

...then **does that mean that a trichromatic animal with a different combination of cones will see incorrect colours wherever there is colour mixing involved?**

If so, **have there been any simulations of how the colour shifts might look from the animals point of view** (obviously has to be a representation made using colours that humans can see)**?** And what could we imagine it looks like for an animal who has dichromatic (or even maybe tetrachromatic) vision?

-----------------

**Edit and example:** Seems to be some confusion about what I mean by 'incorrect colours'  - say we have the intent of showing a TV screen that appears to be *yellow* - more specifically that to the person / animal viewing it will percieve it emitting light that *appears to be at 580nm wavelength*. So the TV screen turns on all red and all green pixels at full brightness, because for humans this red + this green is sensed as the same colour as a 580nm wavelength beam of light. But if this combination of red and green light does not appear to be the same as a 580nm wavelength beam, that's what I mean by incorrect. Which seems like it may occur in many animals. Please let me know if I'm under any wrong assumptions with how this works.

The math behind the way that combinations of different wavelengths of light are interpreted may be of use here.

Can someone who is lifting heavier than another person expect a larger increase in muscle size, even if both require the same amount of effort to lift their weights?

The first person would have previously trained purely for strength, and has the same sized muscles as another person who has only trained for size, and then both start training purely for size. Will the stronger person who is lifting heavier expect a more rapid increase in size, or will their muscle size progress at the same rate because they're both pushing their muscles as hard as one another?

1358246711.0	16m1nx	How would I go about testing if a Vitamin B12 supplement actually contains Vitamin B12?	thedrx	875	311	110	"Vitamin supplements are not as strictly regulated as drugs. Take a this Vitamin B12 [1] supplement for example (chosen at random from a Google search). How would I go about finding out whether it really contains what it says it contains, which is 1000 mcg of Methylcobalamin (a form of B12)?

Out of curiosity, I called a local drug testing lab and they said that because it's not a drug, they do not have any norms to test for and that the supplement could have any number of ingredients effecting false results.

Are there any methods I could either personally perform or use a lab for? If not, why not? Any pointers on terms I could read up on as well as reading material?

Thank you for your time.

Just now, I had a coughing fit on my glass of water because of this, and I wondered if any of the water had actually made it inside of my lungs, and if so, what happens afterward, as I certainly have never been able to successfully cough anything back up.	t5_2qm4e	True

Let's also - and quite reasonably - assume that I did not set off an explosion equivalent to [19.487 megatons of TNT](http://www.1728.org/einstein.htm). 

Where did my mass actually go? The possible avenues I can think of are breath, sweat, urine, feces, and skin shedding. Do we have an understanding of which of these are actually in play, and in what proportions?"	t5_2qm4e	True

What the heck just happened? 	bent_my_wookie	1182	624	427	It was directly i front of me about 10 ft away, and there was nothing near it at all.

This may seem dumb but I thought to myself recently *why*? What is it about the velocity of an object that requires so much energy to increase it from one speed to the next?

If this is vague or even a non-question I apologise, but why is ke=1/2mv^2 rather than ke=mv?

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, I have been reading them though not replying. I think that the distance required to stop an object being 4x as much with 2x the speed and 2x the time taken is a very *intuitive* answer, at least for me."	t5_2qm4e	True

In a peaceful society you don't have to tackle a lot of serious day to day-problems of the kind you might see in underdeveloped countries, or even in America. Things like fighting for your life, your rights, your freedom and your economy are fringe problems in our country. Still I get the impression that there is too much depression.

**edit2: semantics and grammar + thank you so much for many interesting and well-supported answers!**

**edit3: I'm relatively new to reddit, but the amount of effort many of you people put into these answers, the subsequent inquiries and your heroic pursuit of truth in the face of some of the more speculative non-scientific unsupported babble you often find on this subreddit, it just blows me away sometimes.
