I was bored today, and decided to play around with the checkbox ""hack"".

For those who don't know what that is, it's basically creating CSS click events with checkboxes and it doesn't involve any javascript.

This is how it's done:

    input[type=checkbox]:checked ~ div { }

So here's my code, let me know what you all think. It's not really meant to be UI/UX friendly, but just a neat little demo.

Thanks all!

So starting with Foundation 4 would be definately harder for me but i hear alot of good things about it. So i am curious.

**My question:**

Is it worth learning and switching to Foundation 4? What do you guys really like about it and what are some definate advantages/cons over Bootstrap?

What turned out to be the most painful job was cleaning up the CSS, it had literally thousands of unused selectors and rules.

I tried an extension for chrome which didn't work, and then installed ""Dust-me selector for firefox"" (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dust-me-selectors/reviews/), which worked like a charm.

However... this identified all unused selectors, but many rules had multiple selectors, and it did not provide any functionality to actually remove the rules that no longer add any selector.

Since thousands of them were unused, I ended up writing my own python tool to remove them (https://github.com/ccontavalli/css-tidy).

I discovered cssutils for python, which found lots of errors in the CSS, and also comes with tools like csscapture, cssparse, csscombine. I discovered csstidy, and several sites doing validation and cleaning.

Overall, I spent &gt;= 4 hours for a job that should have been pretty straightforward to do, given the right tool.

There are two things I'm asking for here:

1) General resources for picking up CSS layouts. Anything that's helped you understand what the hell is going on under the hood is appreciated.

2) It seems like my biggest gap in my understanding is what gets inherited and what gets overwritten. EG: If the innermost element is set to display: inline, but its parent is set to display: block, and a sibling of the parent is set to display: inline, this somehow actually results in the child and ""uncle"" displaying inline.

I noticed that the person who originally created this reddit had only posted twice in the last year, and hadn't posted in here in over two years, so I asked the admins if they wouldn't mind if I took over.  They kindly obliged.

What does that mean for you?  Nothing too drastic.  I like this community and would like to see it continue to operate the way it has independently, without too much intervention from me.  You may recognize my name as the creator of [/r/firstworldproblems](http://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems), and if you subscribe there, you'll know that I have a very hands-off approach to moderating.  I don't feel the need to micromanage a community.

As you can see, I've put two simple rules into the sidebar:

1. No spam.
2. Be nice.

The sidebar spends some time explaining those two items, but I think they're pretty simple and don't represent any drastic change in direction for this community.  I also clarified this community's raison d'être and mission over there in the sidebar, which basically reflects what the community had already been doing before I came along.

That last point, of course, raises the question: if the community had been managing itself effectively for the last two years without me, why does it need me?  To answer, I'll give you an aviation metaphor: even the best autopilot needs a person to land the plane (which is not actually true anymore, but just give me enough leeway to say that it is for our purposes).  I won't interfere with your posting, but if your posts accidentally get stuck in the spam filter, now you have someone to ask to dig it out.  I will also try to grow this community so that we have a robust userbase with a lot of knowledge and experience to draw on.

Finally, I'll be working over the next few weeks to implement a nice custom style for this reddit that shows off what CSS can do.  If you've been watching First World Problems for the last couple weeks, you've no doubt noticed me tinkering with its design to make reddit's default...*utilitarian*...design a bit more user-friendly.  Once I finish over there, I will take what I've learned about styling reddit and apply it here in a way that makes us look both unique and innovative.

If you have any questions or comments, please do let me know.  I will monitor both this thread and my modmail for any input from subscribers here.  I look forward to working with you all and growing this community to make it the best it can be.

It works pretty decently and can handle complex css code such as media queries, transitions and dynamic font-size. I would say that if a page is properly setup, it can handle most CSS code perfectly.

Having said that, it's relying on a third party CSS parser so it's loading two additional js files and there's still room for performance optimizations. Also, I still have to add support for IE10 'vm' instead of 'vmin'. When that's done, you'll just write code using vmin and the shim will do the translation to 'vm' for you.

Let me know and I'll set it up on github.

Rocketkar	18	2	7	"I'm a designer who's comfortable with PHP, HTML, CSS and to a lesser extent, jQuery, javascript and a little Ruby. Lately what I've been building is small, static sites, or single page apps. Really a nice transition after years of Wordpress and Drupal.


I'm confused as hell, though, by the myriad of options out there for what should be a simple task: building a static page (or 1-page app) with a good, clean set of code, with tools that make the job easier, not require you to spend days learning and configuring them.


I learned Compass and have been using it (it's really good for making cross-browser stuff less of an issue and gives you CSS variables, which are awesome), but it doesn't have a grid system. I also like HTML5 boilerplate, but it doesn't interact with compass. Right now I've got HTML5 boilerplate with its css ripped out and compass spitting out its css, plus the zen grid compass plugin. I can't help but think: this should be a lot simpler. This is too many plugins for your plugins, a rabbit hole of github projects and framework-ception.


So what's your 'stack'? Is the one I described not actually that complicated? What's a realistic toolkit for what I'm doing?

My web design lecturer told me that every time you see an ID in a rule you add 100 to the specificity value, then you add 10 for every class and 1 for every tag name then the rule with the highest value is the one that takes priority.

I would understand that fine but I made the following page:

    &lt;p id=""test"" class=""a b c d e f g h i j k""&gt;Blah&lt;/p&gt;

With the CSS:

    #test{

    }
    .a.b.c.d.e.f.g.h.i.j.k{
        color:red;

Would you just swap out the CSS file with a mobile version?

Luckily the site is coded well with divs so it's not too bad and is easy to style.

I'm new to bootstrap (And responsive design) and my original plan was to create a child theme in wordpress based on it but I'm pretty much just using it for its grid and easy to implement responsiveness. So it's probably better to just use a much lighter framework for this project. 

I would like something light (css only and maybe some JS to handle really shitty old browsers), with ie7 support, proper media queries in it, cross browser compatibility, and nice clean and organized code that a noob can easily follow. 

My original choice was ""skeleton"" but reading a comparison review on vermilion made me second guess that choice:

""Responsive considerations seem like a bit of an afterthought. Examples: tabs do not stack for mobile versions; 1-column images (tiny, since it's a 16-column grid) go to full-width (huge) in the two narrow layouts. ""

So the idea is simple. Split a box into two sub-boxes.
The trick is that everything should be percentual - no fixed sizes (EDIT: apart from potential margins).

One way to do it is setting a *float:left* to both sub-boxes and their *width*s to 80% and 20% respectively. The problem with this method is that some browsers will break the second box into a new line. This can be avoided by setting the widths to 79% and 19% or something similar, but now we get a gap on the right side of the blue box in most browsers.

So how do we do this cross-browser without any gaps?

And another thing, how do we then add our own (fixed size) margins to the red and blue box?"	t5_2qifv	True

After much searching I finally found a 'Near English' phrase that had 0 Google results (it was a hell of a lot harder than I thought it would be).  'staminified dawg' was my key.

I have a domain that I use for random css/php/js tests that was registered on March 23, 2012 and currently has a pagerank of 3 (how I have no idea).  So, I set up some ::before and ::after elements in the form of...

    .petal:before {
    content: ""staminified dawg"";
    display: none
    }


    .petal:after {
    content: ""staminified dawg"";
    visibility: hidden
    }


(The display and visibility were used separately to see if there was any effect from either scenario)


At the same time I linked a new page off the index.html and checked webmaster tools to see the index status.  All the other pages had been indexed.  3 weeks later... the page has been botted since, and the new page had been indexed. 'staminified dawg' still has 0 hits on google.   

So what do we know?  Only that ""staminified dawg"" has yet to be indexed --we still don't know if the {display: none} and {visibility: hidden} tags have had an effect.  

The next step is to make the {content: """"} tags visible on the page and get somethign else indexed at the same time  I guess we'll get a little bit more of an answer then.

Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to css and I know troubleshooting is an important way to learn, but I can't really figure this out. It actually loads fine in firefox (and even IE), but when I open the site in chrome it's messed up at first. It doesn't happen when opening the local file either.

I've played with the logo size as well as the nav bar width, but it didn't seem to do anything. Any ideas??

I am relatively advanced back-end web developer, with a good amount of experience under my belt. I'm now learning front-end development in an attempt to round my skillset out a bit. Where do I look to learn CSS? I know all the syntax, I know how to implement CSS in my web pages, that isn't what I'm looking for. I want to actually *learn* CSS. 
As it stands I can add some basic things to a page. I simply can't seem to make anything professional, and it usually takes me quite a while (and probably not the best practices) to get everything aligned how I see it in my head. I need something beyond the basic tutorials everyone recommends to get started. Where's step #2?

I know a lot of this comes with practice, but is there anything that can at least guide that practice along? I just don't even know where to start most of the time, and practicing generally turns into me putzing around for hours and not accomplishing anything.

1304285391.0	h1lvl	I thought of an addition to the CSS3 color module	Caraes_Naur	9	1	9	"I was playing with the design of one of my sites earlier, when I suddenly wished I could set the text-shadow based on the color property of the element.

This grew into a crude draft of a syntax for computing a color value based on another color value.

For example, a common practice of mine is to make :hover colors of links lighter than in their default state.  This has to be done separately for every link color, but this new syntax would allow the hover color for every link to be declared as, say 20% lighter, only once.

Any channel of a color value (red, green, blue; hue, saturation, lightness; alpha) could have some simple arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) applied to produce a new color.

I went through the CSS www-style mail list archives basck into 2008, and only found a brief discussion of a subset of these capabilities in [Color lightening and Darkening](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Aug/0239.html).

I've recently released a PHP5.3 library to easily run all CSS through lessphp (LESS). And when your project goes live, all CSS and JS can be minified and cached locally and remotely for lightening fast requests. No need to change how you include your assets in your templates.

You can find out more here: http://mun.ee

If anyone has any questions or suggestions, let me know.

Hopefully this will help you guys out :)."	t5_2qifv	True

Lord_of_Lords	10	2	5	"Hi i'm trying to create a website that categorizes common books read in school, and I want it set up more or less like the way Thisiswhyimbroke.com is. I can't figure out how to edit my Wordpress theme to get posts to look like I want: http://i.imgur.com/ul1iF.jpg, instead of this: http://i.imgur.com/PSADV.jpg. My website is booksforschool.org.

So, I messaged the creator of thisiswhyimbroke.com for advice on how to set up a website in his style.

Hi, I'm trying to create a book review site and I want it set up similar to how Thisiswhyimbroke.com is set up. I was wondering what WordPress theme the site is based off of. Thanks so much!

&gt;[–] from ThisIsWhyImBroke sent 2 days ago
It's a custom built theme. All you need is a &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;, and make every product a wordpress post and style them in &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;, then style the theme as an inline block for the ul li's.

&gt;[–] to ThisIsWhyImBroke sent 2 days ago
Thanks so much!

I have no idea what he means unfortunately. CSS code is over my head right now until I learn. Can you help me know what he meant? Also, point me in the right direction to have posts appear on the front page like I want. Thanks!

Also 1 last thing sorry to keep bothering you.  How do I make each post appear uniform in length?"	t5_2qifv	True
1353304808.0	13fsgn	Losing the very bottom of my pages, and can't figure out why.	emote_control	8	1	14	"I'm writing a page for a school project, and I've run into a weird problem that google doesn't seem to be able to solve.  Here's my HTML, followed by my CSS:

This is my index.html (trimmed for clarity):

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=""container""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""header""&gt;
                Header Stuff
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
			    &lt;iframe src=""home.html"" frameborder =""0"" name=""mainframe""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/body&gt;

This is the page that appears in the iframe, home.html:

    &lt;body&gt;
		&lt;div class=""contentdiv""&gt;
            Frame content
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

And here's my CSS:

    html
{
height:100%;
}

    body
{
min-height:100%;
height:100%;
background-color:#953b3b;
font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
overflow:hidden;
}

    #container
{
position:absolute;
width:100%;
height:100%;
}

    #header
{
text-align:center;
z-index:50;
height:15%
}

    #content
{
position:relative;
height:85%;
width:100%;
}

    iframe
{
position:relative;
height:100%;
width:100%;
}

    .contentdiv
{
position:relative;
height:100%;
overflow-y:scroll;
}

When I do this, it works all nice, except that the bottom of the contentdiv extends below the bottom of the browser window, just a teeny bit.  It's almost exactly 3% when I have my browser on fullscreen.  If I set the height of .contentdiv to 97%, it more or less exactly fixes it.  But if I shrink it to a window, I can see that the smaller I make the window, the more extends below the bottom.  When I put content inside the contentdiv, the bottom of the scroll bar is cut off too.

I cannot figure out what the heck is going on.  What is forcing my div to be bigger than the window, and which div is being forced?

Thanks to anyone who can help me figure this out."	t5_2qifv	True

AD6	10	3	19	"I am transforming an XML document using XSLT into multiple tables (these tables are pretty big).  I am trying to avoid using an id or class on each row.

This demo will only take you to the second link if you click within 500ms. Otherwise it returns to the next default state (red or blue in this case, but that is purely for illustration). I only prefixed webkit and moz when I was working on it, so be sure to change it if you are on Opera or IE9-10.

Basically, the first click begins an animation cycle that displays an outside link and then displays yet another at the &gt;99%keyframe, this means that the final bit of animation lasts ~5ms, so the transition is seamless. Instead going back to the original state it goes to a new position that display another link that is identical to the first except for its href. Clicking this new link animates again and then returns us to phase 1. 

I used a viewport and movement to get this effect, but I am certain that other methods of obfuscation would work just as well, but it was easier for me to get this working correctly. 

It might be overly complex, but it is the only implementation of the feature in pure CSS that I know about. Any thoughts on improvements?"	t5_2qifv	True

1370626859.0	1fvi09	[Firefox-specific] Do there exist any zoom-independent sizing units? (Please read before judging!)	Sophira	7	1	4	"I have a question which a lot of people here will take to mean a lack of understanding of Web design, so I want to explain myself first.

*I am not developing a Web page* or anything that is going to be used by anyone except me. Rather, I am using the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) addon for Firefox to allow me to style various pages to my own needs.

Secondly, I am styling Firefox's built-in `ImageDocument` page - the page you see when you go directly to an image link such as http://i.imgur.com/jMMcgbr.gif, which allow you to click the picture to magnify it, and so on. I have a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) userscript that I made that allows me to style these pages.

So, onto my question. I have a background image that I am tiling behind the image itself using CSS like this:

    body.userscript-ff-imagedocument img.decoded {
      background-image: url(""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAACVJREFUOMtjZCAM1PBJMjFQCEYNGAwGMBKKZwYGhlujgTjsDQAAwO4BRcMF20YAAAAASUVORK5CYII="") !important;
      background-size: 5px auto !important;
      background-color: rgb(240, 240, 240) !important;
      box-shadow: 0 0 1em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
    }

(""userscript-ff-imagedocument"" is the class which my userscript adds to the BODY tag when it detects an `ImageDocument`.)

This background image allows me to easily see where transparency exists in the image. However, when I zoom in, the background zooms in with it, which makes it difficult to tell where the image really has transparency and where that's just part of the image. (The `background-size` property makes it a bit easier because the background will move around a little when zooming due to Firefox quirks, but this is obviously not optimal.)

So, my question: **Is there any way to specify units for the `background-size` property that are zoom-independent?** Even if they're only available on internal Firefox pages, that should be okay since this is an `ImageDocument` and not a regular HTML document.

(And it should go without saying that if you're wanting to use zoom-independent units in actual Web design, you're going about it the wrong way and alienating a lot of your viewers. I actually don't expect that this functionality exists, but I figure this would be the best place to ask just in case it does...)"	t5_2qifv	True
1370031109.0	1ffakl	Cross-browser box sizing / flexboxes	admiralteal	7	1	3	"I'm trying to figure out the absolute best-possible cross-browser support for flexboxes for a personal project I'm working on.  This is more idle curiosity than anything concrete.

I know Compass already contains something like this, but I wanted to build it myself to get a good handle on things, and Compass's are a bit too much information all at once.  What I'm really trying to do is a create a reference of prefixing / bad spec implementations for various flexbox properties in order to better-tackle them in the future.  I'd probably never use flexboxes for anything other than a mobile site right now, but it's a fun project nevertheless.

Here's what I have:

    .display-flexbox {
      display: -webkit-box;
      display:    -moz-box;
      display: -ms-flexbox;
      display: -webkit-flex;
      display:         flex; }
    
    .align-items, .box-align {
      -webkit-box-align: center;
         -moz-box-align: center;
      -ms-flex-align: center;
      -webkit-align-items: center;
              align-items: center; }
    
    .flex {
      -webkit-box-flex: 1;
         -moz-box-flex: 1;
          -ms-box-flex: 1;
           -o-box-flex: 1;
                  flex: 1; }
    
    .flex-order, .box-ordinal-group {
      -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 2;
         -moz-box-ordinal-group: 2;
          -ms-box-ordinal-group: 2;
           -o-box-ordinal-group: 2;
      -ms-flex-order: 2;
               order: 2; }
    
    .flex-direction {
      -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;
         -moz-box-orient: horizontal;
          -ms-box-orient: horizontal;
           -o-box-orient: horizontal;
              box-orient: horizontal;
      flex-direction: row; }

The class names are just demonstrating which property each is attempting to effect.

Any comments?  Have I put in anything unnecessary, made any mistakes, or left anything out?

Anyone have a good setup for dealing with justify-content in the most-possible browsers?

edit: left out my box-sizing one.  Nothing to it, though:

    .box-sizing {
      -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
         -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          -ms-box-sizing: border-box;
           -o-box-sizing: border-box;

1360534531.0	189p7m	CSS Problem with max-height:70% on container, and child images with height:auto;	xtinctin	7	1	13	"I already found a workaround to my actual problem, but now I am just curious **""Why http://jsfiddle.net/eFKrJ/11/ and http://jsfiddle.net/eFKrJ/12/ show 2 different results when they should be the same thing?""**

Does that question make sense?


edit:

I wanted to bound a container to the height/width of the viewport, and than bound children elements to that container. This is only possible by utilizing and setting heights and max-heights, along with widths and max-widths. The issue I am discussing is how come everything will work fine, but when it comes to constraining children elements the computed CSS for max-height is not being used as an override for the height css of the container.

I know the other solution for this would be avoiding height all together and just using positioning with left, top, right, bottom all set **but I am confused by why the CSS engine isn't rendering the max-height to constrain children elements**.

I will make a better fiddle set up tomorrow to explain the bug."	t5_2qifv	True

I hope someone can help with this.

There are two websites which use the same code. The only differences are their language files (English version &amp; Spanish version) and their character encoding (ISO-8859-1 &amp; UTF8).

Problem: in certain places the font sizes are inconsistent.

Example: 

Go to http://m.corkjobs.ie and click ""Show Search Options""
Go to http://m.empleosvalencia.es and click ""Mostrar opciones de búsqueda""

Notice the font size in both forms is different. The Spanish text is larger.

I do not understand why this is happening as they have the exact same CSS properties.

* How do I get the side menu to not change the width of the id #toc?  
* I am mostly using IDs because these things I will only use once. Is this correct usage?  
* Is &lt;br /&gt; the correct way to go to the next line? Or should I use &lt;ul&gt; for things like the address/phone number box?

I'm using a WooTheme for my friend's website and it has a ""featured"" box that loops blog posts tagged ""featured."" I was removing one today by simply removing the ""featured"" tag from the specific post, when the slider broke. I don't know what I did wrong, I'm no expert, but I know my way around basic html/css... and removing a featured tag as far as I know should have little or nothing to do with the css that's holding the featured box together. I tried re-tagging the post just to make sure it wasn't removing it that broke the box, but it hasn't gone back to the way it was. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks, guys."	t5_2qifv	True
1361406429.0	18x5zb	Learning CSS and need help with div/padding issues. 	koberg	5	2	8	"Hey, all! I'm relatively new to CSS, been dabbling here and there for a bit, but still consider myself a beginner. I'm trying to design a simple website for my husbands high school reunion and I'm in the stage of simply designing the layout. I currently have three div's, one for the header, one for the menu, and the third for the main information on the site; however, my issues arise when I try to add padding to the div for the main information and layout of the menu div when I'm on a monitor with less resolution. 

When I comment out, or remove the line of code for padding, the div spans the page 100%, but I want to add a 5% padding to the left and right so there's some spacing between the left and right of the body text. When I add 5% padding to the left, the left side of the page looks fine, but it pushes the text of the div off the right side of the page and requires side-scrolling to get the rest of the information. 

As for the menu, I'm not using any absolutes, just percentages, and on my larger, external monitor, the menu items are all horizontally listed, but when I disconnect my monitor and work on my laptop monitor, the menu items get stacked on top of each other.

How can I 1) get the padding for the main text fixed, and 2) get the menu to stay aligned so it's constantly lined up properly?

CSS:

    body{
    	background-color:#800000;
    	margin:0px;
    }
    ul.nav{
    	list-style-type: none;

    	font-weight:bold;
    	text-align:center;
    	text-transform:uppercase;

Well, it looks like a pretty solid case like Google ignores the {content: """"} flags.  I made ""staminified dawg"" visible on the page, and added another page to the site.  Sure enough Google jumped on that other link that I posted, but ""staminified dawg was ignored, and is not a result for that term, even a couple weeks after an on page link was indexed.

1355317495.0	14q1ss	Extreme newbie attempting to learn CSS, question about width percentage	Twitchyy	7	1	8	"Yesterday I started learning the very basics of CSS and HTML and I'm putting together basic websites to retain what I'm learning. Below is part of one of my CSS files and the body of the HTML file referencing that I put together. My problem is simple (I hope): Despite both classes ""wrap"" and ""box"" using the same width percentage, ""box"" uses slightly more width as shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/WukTA.jpg) (on the right). What did I do wrong, how do I fix it?

Part of HTML body: 

    	&lt;body&gt;
    
    		&lt;div class=""wrap""&gt;
    			&lt;h1&gt;My Website&lt;/h1&gt;
    			&lt;div class=""box""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    		&lt;/div&gt;
    
    	&lt;/body&gt;
CSS:

    .wrap {
    	min-width: 600px;
    	width: 70%;
    	margin: auto;
    }
    .box {
    	min-width: 600px;
    	width: 70%;
    	height: 100%;
    	background: #9e9e9e;
    	position: absolute;
    }
    body {
    	font-family: sans-serif;
    	background: #b5b5b5;
    }

Similarly, with the height of ""box"" being set at 100%, it takes more than that which makes the scrollbar of nothingness appear (scroll bar even though there's nothing to see by scrolling down). Any ideas on that?

The idea I had is to have pictures of different foods, which resize corresponding to their percentage of different nutritional values (e.g. fat or carbs) when you click on a link to that particular nutritional value.  

I can't seem to get this to work. Here's the HTML I have:  

    &lt;a href=""#tag1""&gt;Tag 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""#tag2""&gt;Tag 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""#tag3""&gt;Tag 3&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div id=""tag3""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""sourcreamstandard""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div class=""sourcreamtag1""&gt;&lt;img src=""sourcream.jpeg"" /&lt;/div&gt;

     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;

And the CSS:

     .sourcreamstandard img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     }

     .sourcreamtag1 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -50px;	
	
     }

     .sourcreamtag2 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -100px;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3 img {
     	height:50px;
     	weight:50px;
     	position: relative;
     	top: -150px;	
     }

     .sourcreamstandard, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;
     }

     .sourcreamtag1 #tag1:target img {
     	height:400px;
     	weight:400px;
	
	
     }

     .sourcreamtag2, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;	
     }

     .sourcreamtag3, #tag1:target img {
     	display:none;	
     }
  
And so on, with :target pseudo-classes for every one of the tag links, the idea being that when a tag is selected, the images while take on the CSS classes which hide them or resize them when appropriate.

Hi. The above image is the relevant part of the website. The three bold headings (name email and declaration) are dt items in a definition list. The text under each is obviously the dd items for each.

The css I've used to position the menu and style it is as below.

    	height:300px;

    	margin-left:-300px;
	
    }

    ul  /* list decoration (removal) */
    {
      list-style: none;
    }

    #menu a /* menu static link decoration */
    {
    text-decoration:none;
    color:#dddddd;
    }

    #menu a:hover /* menu hover link decoration */
    {
     text-decoration:underline;
    }

    #menu ul
    {
    border:1px solid #7a7a7a;
    padding:0px;
    width:200px;
    }

    #menu li /* menu */
    {
    	border:1px solid #dc5d72;
    	padding:5px;
      	background-color:#b51032;
    	border-left:8px solid #741617;
    }

    #link_menu /* menu heading */
    {
    	font-weight:bold;
    	margin:0px;
    	color:black;
    	background-color:#dddddd;
    	text-align:center;

     }

    #menu li:first-child /* menu */
    {
     	border:0px;
    	padding:0px;
    }


I'd like to stop all the &lt;dd&gt;s from flowing over the top of the menu div. I've tried applying clear:both; and clear:right; to each of the separate children in the details section but none make it stop :(

Please help :D


**EDIT: Fixed it. The #menu{margin-left:-300px;} meant that the div wasn't actually where it was. I had it there because the &lt;hr/&gt; above the details section was cutting off ~400px before the right side of the page. I must have deleted some padding somewhere because now, even though the margin setting is gone, it still rules to the edge of the page.**"	t5_2qifv	True
