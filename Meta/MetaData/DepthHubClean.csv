The ""report"" button only does anything if the submission is *actually breaking a rule*.  When a submission is reported, all that happens is the submission gets highlighted to mods with the number of reports, and two buttons: [remove] / [approve].  If I can't go through and find the broken rule, I [approve].  So I end up re-reading a lot of submissions.  I'm on four times now for a recent one - once when it was posted, and once per report.  

I keep hitting ""approve"" every time, too, because I still can't find where they broke a rule.  

I see a lot of complaints in the comments, and I see the same in a number of the reported posts I've approved recently.  If you're reporting a submission that breaks a rule, please help us out and send us a message letting us know why you reported it.  If you're using it as a super downvote, it doesn't work that way, equally, if you're reporting things because you want mods to remove them, we don't work that way.  It is our role to enforce the rules we have, not ban by majority vote or personal taste.  

If what you're trying to tell us is that what you're reporting *should* be against the rules, that's really not the best way to communicate that to us.  We'd have preferred to hear it in mod-mail or a meta thread of some sort.  

We currently have five rules. 

&gt;1. Do not submit links to any site other than Reddit. 
&gt;2. Do not link to your own comments or submissions. 
&gt;3. When linking to discussions, please link directly to the comment branch you want to highlight in the thread, rather than to the original submission.
&gt;4. Please add ?context=x to the URL when linking to comment threads, where x is the number of previous comments you want to include. 
&gt;5. External links may be submitted to the appropriate associated reddit.

Submissions not breaking those rules don't get removed barring *very* exceptional circumstances.  

If it's your sentiment that our current rules need revision, let's talk. I just ask that folks discuss the State of Depth Hub's current content and rules with a mind towards offering and rewarding *constructive* suggestions.  I think many folks will agree that there are problems with current content here, so it'd be more helpful to skip the grousing and start in on ways both mods and the community as a whole can work towards a better array of content.

1349286368.0	10vw98	[META, MOD] Changes to DepthHub rules, in testing for the month of October.  	Anomander	569	126	130	"Hey, DH. We've considered the [discussion we had last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10gmf4/meta_mod_on_the_future_of_depthhub/), and are going to try out a combination of some of the suggestions that got significant support and we felt held the most possibility for creating positive change in this community.

1. For a start, mods are going to start moderating by personal taste. **We will remove posts we feel are certainly not a good fit for this community.** Internally, we're going to be discussing a lot of submissions a lot more, because we as a team are here to act somewhat as checks &amp; balances for each other, and will aim to have consensus on decisions, favouring allowing posts through if dissent exists.

2. We're going to ask that all posters to DH argue their posts' presence in this community. **Each post needs an introduction from OP in some way making clear why they feel their particular submitted comment or conversation has ""depth.""** We believe asking this will result in submitters putting more thought and more care into their submissions. Those making genuine, ""I found depth!"" posts will have no trouble meeting this rule, while those simply looking for a quick karma-grab on a deep-sounding post will be more easily filtered. We hope that these introductions will also provide a stepping-off point for conversations in the comments.

3. We're going to remove all unsupported ""does not belong"" complaints. **If you don't think a submission belongs in this community, argue your reasons.** It's really easy to peanut-gallery a bad post, but not useful unless the comment acts as constructive criticism to OP and other readers. If your argument is particularly convincing, mods may agree with you and delete the offending post.

We want a community that not only collects, but also has, some of the best conversations and comments on Reddit - these changes will allow more filtering of core content, while also promoting interesting and intelligent discourse on submissions.

We are going to be testing this out all October, and will wrap up the month with another discussion to see how people feel it has gone. 

_______________

**Editing to collect useful discussions**:

**Will Mods leave a comment on removed posts?** [We'll do our best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6h580v?context=1)  That said, we're not making any promises.  Message us if you think a post has gone AWOL and you've not heard from a mod.  

**Will you be super open about removed posts and the discussion mods have around the decisions we make?** [Perhaps for testing, we'll open our discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hatzu?context=1), but [likely not permanently](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hi5jb?context=3).  Discussion tends to be stifled by oversight, and we want our team to be honestly and comfortably debating content, not worrying about offending someone reading over their shoulder.  

**Regarding rule 2, where do OP's comments go?** [In the comments, please.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hasfm?context=1)  It should probably be longer than the title allows for, but DH doesn't normally allow self posts.  

**Why not just make DepthHub a .self community so OP can put their blurb in the body text?** [Because we want to keep link and description separate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hicx7?context=1)

**Some sort of time window for OP to include their Rule 2 blurb?**  [~~We'll be reasonable~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6havoh?context=1).  Sorry guys, but ""reasonable"" was being taken advantage of.  [Now we're just being strict](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6j3elo). 

**Rule 1 is scary.  It opens to door for abuse and censorship.** [It really does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hay9h?context=1)  But mods feel that we don't really have another option.  Past discussions soliciting real ""rules"" have been unfruitful because the community struggles to define ""depth"" - it's with reluctance we do this, we're more scared of the mob and of allegations of abuse than you are about the possibility of abuse, I promise you.  

**If the mob disagrees with us, will we put the post back up?**  [Maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hi3fq?context=1)  We're willing to be convinced of many things, but we won't fold if we don't think it's right.  

**How will mods vote on things?  There are only four of you, how about a tie breaker?** [Consensus doesn't need tie-breakers](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hcuj7?context=1) and if we can't reach consensus, we will allow a post free for the community to handle as it sees fit.  

**Rule 3 steals my right to complain!**  [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6h695x) is the top comment that spawns multiple really great discussions about rule three and its role in the community.  Notable content is: [a clarification by what mods expect from ""new"" complaints about posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hb2qa?context=2), and [why we're comfortable raising the bar for complaining at the same time as raising the bar for submitting](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/10vw98/meta_mod_changes_to_depthhub_rules_in_testing_for/c6hd1xy?context=6).

**I want to join the mod team!** We've not reviewed our staffing levels yet, we want to see how labour intensive the new rules are before we make any decisions of that sort.  We'll solicit mods from community members if and when the need becomes apparent.  

Lastly: a very special thank you and shout-out to /u/joke-away, whose impassioned arguments in mod mail spurred this most recent round of discussion, and to whom we owe, in some large degree, getting our shit together and making these changes.  "	t5_2rmpy	True

I wanted to talk to you guys and girls about the direction this subreddit has been heading over the past couple months, and what we as moderators can do to guide it going forward. We've gotten A LOT of complaints that certain posts aren't ""depthhub worthy"" or just don't seem right for the subreddit, and usually the mod team is in agreement about those things. The problem is, 9 times out of 10 they're not breaking any rules, so we just let them stay there. What we need is a good set of rules to help us determine what is ""worthy"" of depthhub, while at the same time not just making up those rules by ourselves. The issue is that what one mod may consider ""unworthy,"" another mod, or even a huge part of our userbase may disagree, and we'd really like to avoid that. 

So, what I'm here to ask you guys for are suggestions on what we can do to stem depthhub from just becoming bestof2. Each time I've brought things up, we really haven't been able to get a good read from the whole community, which is why I'm making this self post.

Some suggestions that never really got decided on were:

* Remove posts that had a comment requesting the submission be removed, if that comment had over x number of upvotes.

* Exclude default reddits.

* Allow the moderators to use their discretion as to what is appropriate for the subreddit.


Now those are just a couple, we really want to hear more, or if you like one of those let us know. We'd like to improve the quality of DepthHub to what it was at the beginning, and we just want to make sure we do that in a way that a large number of you support.

Also, because this will invariably come up. We don't really consider ""but people are voting on things, that means they like them"" to be a valid argument anymore. People are extremly liberal with their upvotes, but much more reserved with downvotes. On top of that, to get to the front page of this subreddit, you need less than .1%, which is obviously not a good indicator of what people really want.

Anyway, PLEASE weigh in with what you think could help.

Thanks!
-bmeckel and the depthhub mod team

It recently occurred to me that it's been a while since we sat down and had a good meta chat. I'd just like to check in and see how things are going. Ah, but before you start a comment or concern regarding the ""quality vs. quantity"" issue, we're not talking about that today. I'd like to know about everything *except* that. Please note that what is voiced here may or may not see its way into policy change. Even if we do decide to make changes, it will undoubtedly be slow. So let's all relax, throw some words around, and see how it goes. I'll get us started.

**What is the ""Quality vs. Quantity"" issue you mentioned, and why aren't we talking about it?**

The ""Quality vs. Quantity"" issue is fundamentally a problem of what people want from DepthHub, and whether they understand how DepthHub actually works. The meat of the issue is that we have *lots* of people here (we just broke 120k, making us the 89th largest subreddit) and with many people comes many desires. Some of our readers want only the most hardcore, in-depth, scientific information (quality), and simply won't be satisfied by anything less. Some of our readers don't mind if the content is only mildly interesting (quantity), as long as there's a lot of it (what else are you going to do at work?). However, most of our readers fall somewhere in-between, preferring a slower&amp;mdash;but not stagnant&amp;mdash;amount of content, while still retaining that spark of knowledge that leaves us feeling refreshed and informed.

We are not talking about this issue because it has been done to death. We've talked, and talked, and talked some more, and have realized that this particular issue cannot be solved with normal rules. For those who don't know, the decision is that moderators have complete oversight over all submissions. This is the end of the story; please do not leave comments here about it.

**Hey, what happened to my (completely inaccurate) submission that had good discussion on DepthHub?**

Our current policy is that the most egregious offenders to science and knowledge, i.e., posts which are demonstrably *wrong*, will be deleted no matter how many comments they have on DepthHub. However, if the post is more up in the air, and the fierce debate that ensues on DepthHub is both respectful and lively, we're apt to keep the post in.

This is definitely up for discussion. Should we keep ""bad"" posts if the ""good"" DepthHub comments become their own source of information?

**Can you *please* do something about the active/visited link colors?**

Absolutely. We have heard your pleas, and we are definitely open to changing the link colors. Please let us know which colors you think would work best.

**tl;dr: How is DepthHub doing? Please don't talk about ""Quantity vs. Quality"" (see above).**"	t5_2rmpy	True

1316797173.0	kp7ux	An update to the way I moderate DepthHub.	blackstar9000	426	73	33	"It's always been an informal part of DepthHub etiquette that you shouldn't link to your own submissions or comments. But as reddits grow, informal etiquette tends to get lost in the shuffle. No one is really at fault. That's just the way it happens when communities get bigger.

Starting now, if a DepthHub submission links to a submission or comment by the same redditor, I will remove the link from DepthHub. I'll also be taking a closer look at DepthHub submissions that link to conversations that the submitter is already involved in, and it will be to my discretion whether or not to remove that link.

Why? Because allowing people to link to their own submissions and comments is subject to at least two kinds of abuse:

1. It can be a way of getting around DepthHub's ""[local domain](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/fl5sd/concerning_links_to_domains_other_than_redditcom/)"" rule. In other words, if you want to post a submission to DepthHub, you could start out by posting it somewhere else, then link to that submission in DepthHub. Effectively, that would be like posting an external link to DepthHub.

2. It can be used as a form of self-promotion. If your submission didn't make it to the front page of the reddit you posted it to, or if your comment in a debate isn't getting as many up votes as the other person's, a link to DepthHub might send a few more votes your way and put you over the top. But DepthHub shouldn't be anyone's personal up vote army. We reward spontaneous depth that we find out there on Reddit, and we in turn are rewarded for discovering depth.

Neither of these were really immanent problems with DepthHub was still small, but with 23,000+ subscribers, those abuses start to become more tempting. We may not even recognize that we're doing something that might guide us away from the benefits this reddit has to offer.

The only exception I plan to make is this: If you start a new depth-centric reddit, or if you have an announcement about an event you're staging as a moderator in a depth-centric reddit, you're still welcome to post a link to those announcements.

None of this is personal. It's just something that needs to be done to keep DepthHub on the right track. If you've linked to your own submission or comment in the past, don't worry about it. I'm not going to enforce this retroactively, and no one can blame you for breaking a rule that didn't yet exist. Just be aware that it's a rule now.

Thanks."	t5_2rmpy	True

1334538982.0	sbmoj	A change of moderation.	blackstar9000	366	41	120	"Hey, all. I've had a change of career this month, and the net impact for DepthHub is that I'm no longer really able to keep an eye on this sub as I have in the past. Rather than let things go to pot in order to maintain a controlling interest, I've decided that it's time to turn DepthHub over to new moderators.

I don't have anyone picked out yet. In fact, I'm opening this thread to give you loyal subscribers the opportunity to voice your opinion in the matter. If you have suggestions about who should replace me, this is the place to discuss it. Democratic process on Reddit tends to be rather tedious and ineffectual (and I say this as someone who has gone through great pains to help set up democratic processes in other subs), so this isn't a vote, but I will make a good faith effort to take your suggestions and pleas to heart.

Ideally, what I'm looking for are three or four mods willing to continue DH in more or less the direction I've already charted, enforcing the rules I've already implemented in the sidebar. The most important of them are 1) Do not submit links to any site other than Reddit, and 2) Do not link to your own comments or submissions. That last one requires that you actually click on the link, and then `ctrl+f` the name of the submitter to make sure that they're not indirectly karma farming. If their only comment in the thread is just notification that they're linking from DH, I usually leave it, since those comments aren't really competing with other comments, and those notifications rarely get more than a couple of up votes anyway."	t5_2rmpy	True

Anomander	379	98	82	"Following up [my last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/tonn3/mod_meta_lets_talk_about_the_dh_rules_aka_the/), I want to thank you all for taking the message to heart.  There are *far* fewer reports on posts not breaking rules than there were prior.  We really appreciate that.  

However, it's still apparent that there is significant discontent with current content, and that users are still wanting DepthHub content to more strictly adhere to their standards of ""depth.""

I'd love to find a way to better serve this community and guide its content towards what many seem to feel it's intended to be, but need a hard rule to fall back on.  If you asked me to ""only let deep content in,"" our content would not meaningfully change, there is *very little* that I find to outright be ""not DepthHub material,"" despite complaints of exactly that sentiment in the comments.  I personally echo [ShiDiWen's feelings](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/tonn3/mod_meta_lets_talk_about_the_dh_rules_aka_the/c4olru1) about DH content - the variety and weird stuff is what I love about this community.  

Which is why I want to repeat the challenge I put forward in the last post:  Can you write a rule or rules that clearly define depth in a way that *does not require mods to use personal judgement or taste* while, preferably, also not requiring us to copy &amp; paste the linked comment thread into a word processor for a ""word count"" or some other bother-intensive method of vetting submissions.

1296923413.0	ffu5q	Okay, I think the voting system of Reddit, as it is used nowadays, has largely amplified the bandwagon effect not only found in comments, but in links as well. I fear that this may lead to the further specialisation of opinions in this community. How do you suppose we could remedy this conundrum?	hxcloud99	226	54	104	"It is in my opinion that we, as old-timers in this community, have not done a great job in inculcating newcomers to the standards by which we define the democracy of this community. For example, if one would care to peruse the more populated subreddits like /r/askreddit and /r/reddit.com, one would find that a significant fraction of the content in these subreddits is composed of overwrought memes and points irrelevant to the discussion. Now, it is in my understanding that the administrators have not rigorously defined the rules of the Arrows, as evidenced by the relative fluidity of their purpose in certain contexts:

&gt;Mass-downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

I have come to the conclusion that the meaning of the phrase, ""If it really is the content you have a problem with..."" is ill-defined. What type of problem? Does it pertain to the relevancy of the content to the overarching theme of the mother thread? Does it pertain to the sensitivity of the reader with regards to certain issues? Does it pertain to a misuse of the English language?

&gt;Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add nothing to the discussion.

Ah, here is a treat for the functionally prescriptivist. It is here that it is established that *the down arrow is used to express discontent in the supposed relevance of the comment*. But to what end do we put our threshold? Where should we mark the boundary for relevancy? Does the relevance condition apply to the immediate parent? If so, then chains of comments increasingly irrelevant to the mother thread will be permitted, and one should expect that the ends would be as relevant to the mother thread as paint is to a desert wasteland. I suppose we should examine more closely the ramifications of the required relevancy condition to find the optimal ordinal value of the referential upper hierarchy comment that will allow free-flowing conversations, but restrict such to the overarching theme of the thread.

&gt;Make comments that lack content. Phrases such as ""This."", ""lol"", ""upboat"", or ""MAN THIS IS SO COOL!!!"" are not witty or original, and do not add anything noteworthy to the discussion. Just click the arrow -- or write something of substance.

&gt;Announce your votes to the world. You can give constructive criticism on a comment, but avoid starting a flame war. Try, ""This comment just seems to be attacking the submitter,"" instead of, ""Go back to Digg."" Comments like ""dumb link"" or ""lol, upvoted!"" are not terribly informative. Just click the arrows.

&gt;Vote! The up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be. If you think something is good, upvote it...

Here, we have multiple instances suggesting that the upvote (assuming that it is indeed what was referred to) should be relegated to a case of personal preference, even going so far as to *explicitly* suggest that if one ""think[s] something is good, upvote it"". I for one think that this is a sloppy way of doing things, and it would only serve to reinforce the ultimate bad that I and a few others like me have been trying to fight off: that is, the narrowing and polarisation of opinions. So I propose that we try to identify the most neutral and objective way to define ""goodness"" of a comment. 

Gentlefolk, these acts of rigour and the outlining of their implementation shall culminate the entirety of our exercise. And should it come to the case that we stumble upon a few gems, I feel that the administrators should be notified."	t5_2rmpy	True

Which, as one of the guys who goes around saying that, once reddits pass a certain threshold of readership numbers, conversation drifts irresistibly toward the lowest common denominator, makes me a little nervous.

But having said that, I want to note that we've crossed that particular milestone without any discernible negative effects. If anything, I'd say we're getting more on-target posts lately than we've gotten over the entire course of /r/DepthHub's 10+ month history.

As with all things reddit, this joint is what you make of it, and so far, you guys have done a good job of making it what it aspires to be: a hub for in-depth conversations and submissions found all over the site.

To our new readers: welcome. And to those of you who've been part of /r/DH for some time now: keep up the good work.

To all involved: thanks."	t5_2rmpy	True

Lapper	211	66	37	"[We asked for your feedback](http://redd.it/12g7by) a couple days ago on the state of the subreddit following the [October testing](http://redd.it/10vw98). You voiced your concerns, and we hear you loud and clear. We noted the following issues:

1. **Post volume is too low.** While our post volume was never all that high in the first place, it would seem our stringent rule enforcement decreased the post volume to unacceptable levels.

1. **We're missing out on good content.** Rule #1, ""defense of depth"", was initially imposed due to issues arising from too many content-less posts. However, a high amount of worthwhile posts ended up being canned under this rule as collateral damage.

With this in mind, we will impose the following rule change for the month of November: **rule #1, ""defense of depth"", will be abolished.**

All other rules will remain as they were. Have a nice month.

**tl;dr: You are no longer required to append a comment defending the depth of your submission.**

The posts removed as a result of #1 will be made public within the next day or so."	t5_2rmpy	True

1310663544.0	ipl2u	Some changes to the DepthHub community.	blackstar9000	158	18	78	"If you've been part of DepthHub for a while, you may have seen me talk about the problem with our list of affiliated reddits. And if you've PM'd me recently asking to be added to that list, you've probably been disappointed by my response.

The short of it is this: I created DepthHub more than a year ago, but never came up with a clear criteria for inclusion in the sidebar. That wasn't particularly problematic so long as the community stayed relatively small, but we're now closing in on 20,000 subscribers, and requests for sidebar inclusion average about one per week.

So, from now on, there will be two criteria for inclusion in the sidebar, one preliminary, and one retrospective:

1. **Your reddit must prominently specify that it specializes in long-form or in-depth submissions.** Preferably in your sidebar. Linking to DepthHub will not, on its own, cover that, although reciprocal links to DepthHub will still be required.

2. **Moderators should make an effort at ensuring compliance.** That doesn't mean you have to rule with an iron-fist, deleting any posts that aren't up to snuff, but if standards slip I will want to see the moderators doing something to counteract that slippage, even if it's as simple as a self post re-emphasizing the need for more in-depth content.\*

I'm not out to force anyone's hand. As always, DepthHub affiliation is strictly voluntary to begin with, so if the mods of another reddit don't want to meet those conditions, that's fine. All they lose is a link in our sidebar, and in the grand scheme of things, that's nothing to cry over.

The reason for those conditions is simple: DepthHub offered reciprocal links and nominal affiliation as a way of encouraging in-depth submissions by promoting and supporting reddits that specialize in that sort of content. Those promotions are less effective if we water down our list with links to reddits that aren't especially committed to that sort of content. I don't want to short-change reddits and moderators that are really out to encourage in-depth content on Reddit by lumping them in with reddits that include everything.

So what does that mean in practical terms. Three things:

1. If you're a subscriber/contributor to DepthHub, nothing. Keep submitting and reading DepthHub links the way you always have. There's never been a requirement to draw material specifically from our affiliated reddits, and that isn't changing with the new criteria.

2. If you moderate one of the reddits in our sidebar, and you want to stay there, check to make sure you meet those criteria. I'll be cleaning up our current list over the next few days, and reddits that don't meet those criteria will be removed. I'll PM the mods before I remove it to give them a chance to be compliant.

3. If you've messaged me in the past to have your reddit added to the list, and were disappointed in my response, now's the time to try again -- provided that you meet those two criteria.

In other news, I'm closing down [MethodHub](http://www.reddit.com/r/MethodHub). I'll admit that it suffered, in large part, from [a lack of clear direction](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fxf3f/an_appeal_to_the_science_community_of_reddit/), and [recent attempts to restructure it](http://www.reddit.com/r/MethodHub/comments/hdlsm/whats_going_on_with_methodhub/) haven't helped much. Ultimately, though, I've come to the conclusion that there's simply no demand for a science-oriented hub community on Reddit, and no clear way to distinguish between submissions that belong there and submissions that don't. If anyone would like to do something with that community, PM me and I'll gladly sign over moderation rights.

The demise of MethodHub means two things. *One*, science-themed reddits are again eligible for inclusion in our sidebar -- provided, of course, that they meet our new criteria. And *two*, science-based submissions are again welcome in our queue -- although, enforcement was so lax on that point that I'll bet most of you were never aware that they [were supposed to go somewhere else](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/d7qr6/introducing_methodhub/).

Questions, objections, tankards? This is the place to raise them.

----

\* This one is, I realize, going to require some subjective calls on my part. I'm not entirely happy with that, and I would have much preferred a more objective criteria in its place, but it's better than no criteria at all. At least, I hope it is."	t5_2rmpy	True

If you think you have a link to an external domain that ought to qualify as an exception to this general rule, [contact me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23DepthHub) before you submit it and explain why you think it should be allowed.

While I appreciate the attempt to bring our attention to in-depth content, those submissions should be going to one of our associates.  If you're not sure what reddit a submission would go best in, [TrueReddit](/r/TrueReddit) and [indepthstories](/r/indepthstories) are good catch-alls.

A good rule of thumb is this: if the link you're submitting to DepthHub doesn't have www.reddit.com as its domain, it probably needs to go in one of our associated reddits, rather than here.

That said, please be polite to anyone who slips up.  This hasn't been a problem so far, but we have a lot of new people coming in (about 3,000 new subscriptions in the last 3 days! -- anyone know why we're suddenly so popular?), so I'm hoping the long-time subscribers will make an extra effort to be patient.

Thanks!

](http://redd.it/10vw98)

We added rules 1, 7, and 8.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;1. All posts must be accompanied by a comment explaining or defending the ""depth"" that resulted in its posting here.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;7. Moderation of this community is currently opinion-based. Mods have been asked to use our own judgement regarding whether a post is or is not DH appropriate.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;8. Complaints about posts not containing an argument or explanation as to why a post is ""not DH material"" will be removed.

We enforced these rules to the letter, removing 80 posts and 57 comments in the month of October. For reference, there were 43 approved posts during that same time.

* 43 posts were removed due to a lack of a comment defending their depth. 5 of those posts were reinstated after the OP rectified this.

* 29 posts were removed due to moderator opinion. Posts with strong negative feedback from the community were also removed.

* 16 comments were removed due to not containing information regarding why a post had no depth.

* 13 posts and 41 comments were removed for breaking other rules.

That's our data. You've seen what happened. Now we put it to you: what comes next? Here are some prompts for those commenting.

* Did you notice an increase in subreddit quality? A decrease? No discernible change?
* Did you find moderator action proper? Overbearing? Speedy or unresponsive?
* Was this testing period a waste or a blessing? Should we make the rules even more stringent, change them, or remove them entirely?

Thank you for bearing with us during this turbulent trial.

---

From the comments:

**DH: Will our comments discussing the poor quality of a defense of depth be removed under rule #8?**

Absolutely not. The type of comments that we removed under rule 8 are comments no one would want to see in any subreddit. They insult the OP and the community, and they have no explanation as to why they disagree.

**DH: Do you think DH has missed some potential interesting discussions because of rule 1?**

Absolutely. Posts removed because of rule #1 ranged from okayish to ""Just put up a comment, we really want this pushed through."" Anomander had a wonderful suggestion that we do a weekly recycling of links removed due to rule #1, so that DH doesn't miss out on great content.

**DH: There seemed to be a significant drop in post quantity during October. I would enjoy a more active subreddit.**

Rule #1 is most likely the culprit here. There were plenty of viable posts which were removed under this rule."	t5_2rmpy	True

1292864447.0	eou7p	Help me make DepthHub better.	blackstar9000	131	12	93	"Two things:

Firstly, /r/DepthHub has grown a great deal in the last several months, and I think it's time we take another look at it and see if we can't sharpen its focus and purpose a bit.  To that end, I'm opening the floor to suggestions.  What do you think would make DepthHub better fulfill its mission of promoting in-depth discussion on reddit?  The ideas can be as small as changes to the side bar, or as big as ideas about the fundamentals of what goes on here.  I'm open to anything, but if you're not sure what /r/DH ought to be aiming for, take a couple of minutes to read through the [opening declaration](http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/bkd0n/what_is_depthhub_what_does_it_do/).

In particular, I'm wondering if there's something more creative that can be done with the list of associated reddits, so any ideas concerning that would be much appreciated.

Secondly, I've noticed that we're lapsing back into the habit of posting external links here.  What worries me isn't so much that we'll be overrun with links to non-reddit domains (like cnn.com -- which, incidentally, rarely provides much depth).  Honestly, there haven't been that many external links.  The worrisome trend is that those links tend to get 4 or 5 times the score as the highest scoring links to pages on the reddit domain.  Which is, in light of DepthHub's mission, a bit backwards.  I've already strengthened the side bar instructions, but I suspect that part of the problem is simply that most of us are voting these submissions up on our front page, without noticing that they were submitted to /r/DH rather than /r/news or some more general reddit.  So I'm going to ask that you help out in two ways.  One, if you're subscribed to DepthHub, please try to notice when a story you're upvoting on your front page is a DepthHub submission.  And, two, when you're evaluating out DepthHub submissions, please make sure that the links to the reddit domain get more attention that links to other domains.

While I'm at it, thanks to all of the people who have chimed in on submissions to other domains, letting the submitters and readers know that they're not totally in line with DepthHub's intent.  I've been pleased to see that most such comments have been both informative and respectful.

Link accordingly.	blackstar9000	115	15	6	"I mention this because I've seen a number of links to /r/DH lately that lead to the entire comment section of a post. I've been guilty of it, too, but if you want to highlight in-depth discussion, you're better off linking to a specific comment and the thread that follows it, rather than linking to the entire comment section. Otherwise, what usually happens is, that a comment section that looked like it was mostly full of in-depth discussion when you posted the /r/DH link, gradually fills up with brief, pithy comments, and the in-depth discussion grows more and more difficult to find.

As mentioned in the sidebar, you can also link to the context, in order to highlight the in-depth tangent of a larger discussion, effectively filtering out the more frivolous conversation. If you're linking to a discussion, and want to isolate a specific thread, use the permalink for a late comment and add ""?context=x"" to the URL, where x is the number of previous comments in the thread.

If you want to highlight an in-depth submission (meaning, the linked-to article itself), linking to the comment section makes sense. But if you're linking to the discussion in the comments section, please try to bear in mind that what /r/DH users see when they click on your link may not look exactly like what you saw when you first got there.
