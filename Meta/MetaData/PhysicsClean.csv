1342129503.0	wgqki	"Lets get this right:  The Higgs Boson does *not* give ""us"" mass."	Foolie	724	116	170	"After reading this one too many times from lazy physicists and and science-writers, we need to kill off this obnoxious phrase.

**TLDR** We are protons and neutrons, which have mass because of the energy associated with the quantum chromodynamic interactions associated with its constituents.  The fraction of the proton mass which comes from its interaction with the Higgs mechanism is less than 1%

**The Extended Rant**, written for a somewhat non-technical audience:

The Higgs mechanism isn't what gives *us* mass.

No, seriously.

Not just us.  Also our dogs and houses and laptops and such.  

We can use the Higgs mechanism to give mass to fundamental particles:  Quarks and electrons and W's and Z's.  We are, however, made up, largely, up composite particles: protons and neutrons.

A brief aside before I dive into this.  We're going to be living in Einstein-land for a second.  By this I mean that we are going to start using 'Mass' and 'Energy' interchangeably, E=mc^2 and all that.  What I really mean by 'Mass' in this context (and what physicists in general mean when they start talking about these scales), is 'The energy required to create something and then have it sit there', or rather 'the energy that is intrinsic to the particle itself, independent of what it's doing'.

So, we are made up of protons and neutrons, and protons and neutrons are made out of quarks, and the Higgs boson gives mass to quarks, done and done, right?

Go look up the masses and compositions.  Wikipedia will do.:

A proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark.  It has a mass of 1 GeV.
An up quark has a mass of .002 GeV
A down quark has a mass of .005 GeV.

Now, we do some arithmetic:  2 * .002 + 1 * .005 = 1!

Wait, I've screwed that up, let me try again

multiply by two.... line up the decimal.... huh.

That doesn't seem right.

The proton seems to have a bunch of mass, but if i just weigh the pieces, I can't find it.

See, the proton is not just three little sterile balls sitting in a diagram.  To explain why, I need a second brief aside to explain the strong nuclear force.  The strong nuclear force has it's name for a reason.  It's STRONG.  It's absurdly strong.  In a sense it's infinitely strong:  Here's the sense:  Imagine I take a little ball something that exerts gravity, or electro-magentism.  It sends out a pull to the rest of the universe that gets weaker and weaker as things get further away.  I can count up the total pull it can exert and, because it gets weaker as things get further away, I come to a finite answer.  This is how much 'energy' my ball of gravity-exerting-thing or ball of electricity-exerting-thing has.  If I do the same thing with the strong nuclear force, I find that the pull doesn't get weaker as I go far away, it gets *stronger*.  Now, there's a lot of space that's really far away that my strong force is pulling at harder and harder.  If I try to add all of those up, I get infinity.  eep.

Clearly, we are not being torn apart by the strong nuclear force, and the reason is this.  I can't make a ball of strong nuclear charge.  Any time I find the strong nuclear force working, it's sitting inside of some collection of particles where, over a long distance, their strong nuclear force cancels out.  If I had a pair of particle have a strong nuclear charge, and I start pulling them apart, they would pull harder and harder and harder against me, until that pull takes so much energy, it turns into new particles (one particle and one anti-particle at a time) that cancel out the strong nuclear charge that I had.

Okay, so the strong nuclear force is so strong, that it creates particles to cancel itself out over long distances.  What does this have to do with me being bad at math?  Well, those quarks inside the proton have a strong nuclear charge .  They have an electric charge too.  If I'm looking closely enough to actually see these individual strong nuclear charges, then I can see the huge pulls that they're exerting on everything around them.  (These pulls have so much energy that the are being converted constantly into particles and anti-particles for very brief periods of time).  These huge pulls have a lot of energy associated with them, and this means that if I need to make a proton, I have to provide enough energy for these huge pulls.  This extra energy isn't just some small correction, it's actually 99% of the energy of a proton.  Even moreso, I don't need a Higgs mechanism to generate this 99% of the proton mass.  It comes from the amazing behavior of the strong nuclear force.  Even if my quarks had zero mass in themselves, generating the strong nuclear pulls I need to make a proton will still take a bunch of energy.  That energy is intrinsic to the proton, and literally is the proton mass.

So, 99% of the proton mass (and similarly the neutron mass) is coming from the strong nuclear force and not the Higgs mechanism, and we have one electron per proton in the universe at 0.0005 GeV, compared to the proton mass of 1GeV.  (The electron does get all of its mass from the Higgs mechanism, it's just not very much).

In closing:  Please stop saying that the Higgs boson gives mass to everything we know.  The truth is *so* much cooler."	t5_2qhi6	True

They lack the willingness to work a thing out slowly and clearly and sharply in their mind, so that they can actually 'feel it work.' They want to try their first idea right off; and the result is they use up lots of money and lots of good material, only to find eventually that they are working in the wrong direction. We all make mistakes, and it is better to make them before we begin.”

“The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”

1366093888.0	1cg48r	Dimensional analysis to estimate blast yield of today's explosion in Boston	PenisBall	478	111	122	"**Purpose:**  It's possible to estimate the blast yield of the explosive device used in today's Boston explosion.  The blast yield can then be used to help investigators determine what type of device exploded.  Authorities probably have a method to determine what the device is but maybe we can help.  


**Method:**  Some time ago I remember using dimensional analysis to calculate the blast yield of a nuclear explosion.  ~~I wish I could remember the name of the physicist that invented this process so I could give him/her credit but sadly I can't remember.~~  The name of the physicist that used this technique is [Geoffrey Taylor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._I._Taylor).  This is a back of the envelope calculation based on what I can remember so I need the help of r/physics to peer review my math and make sure I didn't forget a variable or make a mistake.  Although this was used to calculate the blast yield of a nuke, this same principles should apply to smaller explosions.

Units:

radius r = L

air density  ρ = M/(L ^ 3)

energy e = M(L/T) ^ 2

time t = T


we can write r as a function of the other three variables as:

r = f(ρ,e,t)

(1) : r = A[ρ ^ x][e ^ y][t ^ z] where A is a constant

Substituting units yields:

L = A[[ML ^ -3] ^ x][[M(L/T) ^ 2] ^ y][T] ^ z
 
Expanding and solving exponents:

L = (M ^ x)(L ^ -3x)(M ^ y)(L ^ 2y)(T ^ -2y)(T ^ z)

0 = x + y

1 = -3x + 2y

0 = -2y + z


x = -1/5

y = 1/5

z = 2/5

Substituting back into (1):

 r = A[ρ ^ (-1/5)][e ^ (1/5)][t ^ (2/5)]

Solve for e:

e = A'(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

Values for A', r, ρ, and t:

A was experimentally determined to be 1 (If I remember correctly, please correct me if I'm wrong).


r is difficult to determine but I gave it my best shot as I will articulate below.  If you can extrapolate a better estimate for r then please feel free to chime in and make it more accurate.  Some of the following pictures will be **SERIOUSLY NSFL** but I needed to view them to find the radius of the blast at a given time t.  This analysis is for the first explosion located [here](http://i.imgur.com/tHbnNq8.jpg).  [Here](http://imgur.com/V3dd0gF) is an overhead view of the location that had the bomb.  The area in red is where I reasonably determined the blast should have taken place based on the best images I could find.  If you notice [here](http://imgur.com/scis9EV) it appears the the restaurant railing was impacted by a shock wave.  If the blast was directly in front of the rail then the interference pattern should look like [this](http://imgur.com/HgWxAIv).  This seemed plausible but not precise; also, there were reports that the device might have been detonated from the inside of a mailbox.  A quick search turned up that there [was a mailbox that should have been located in the vicinity](http://imgur.com/QiIK5p9).  A blast from the location of the mailbox should have produced an [almost identical shock wave](http://imgur.com/4O4Qxii).  I started to wonder if mailboxes were removed from the sidewalk before the race for safety reasons so I panned down one block before the finish line and came across [this](http://imgur.com/aLMFFVD) picture that demonstrates a mailbox that wasn't removed.  This probably means that they weren't removing mailboxes before the race.  A NSFL [picture from the second explosion](http://imgur.com/z3h0Prz) confirms that there was a mailbox in that vicinity as well that wasn't removed.  An up close NSFL [picture of the first explosion](http://imgur.com/eD9u1SL) shows evidence of smoke where the mailbox should be.  So then [where is the mailbox](http://imgur.com/3q7z2eD)?  I was about to give up until I came across [this picture](http://imgur.com/2Yn5SXw) that seemingly gave me a smoking gun of where the explosion took place because of blast residue.  That was until I found [this picture](http://imgur.com/Nqy9wLD) taken earlier than the previous that doesn't have blast residue.  I was running out of ideas so I turned to the video evidence and found [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z86vAWnu_og) that doesn't show exactly where the blast takes place but it shows the direction in which the people are near the blast are pushed from the shock wave.  If the blast came from the mailbox then you would expect the victims to have been pushed parallel to the road and if the blast was behind the victims then you would expect to see them pushed perpendicular to the road.  The video evidence confirms that the blast occurred behind the mailbox.  So where is the mailbox?  I honestly don't know but further support for the no mailbox theory is the lack of shrapnel from a mailbox.  A mailbox probably wouldn't incinerate from an explosion but it would have structurally failed where pressure escaped.  This would cause the box to fragment and we should have then seen pieces of mailbox at the bomb site.  Therefore no mailbox.  My next tactic was to estimate the location of the explosion based on where the most carnage occurred.  I made a [cartoon drawing of the location](http://imgur.com/q7X3EMS) so I wouldn't have to post a picture of the bodies.  Using the known size of a standard sidewalk brick I could the estimate that the perpendicular distance to the road at about three meters.  So r=3.  [Typical explosive velocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_velocity) are in the range of 1800m/s to 3000m/s in gas.  

If 1800m/s is correct then:

r = 3m

t = .00167s

If 3000m/s is correct then

r = 3m

t = .001s


Finding ρ:

It was about 15 degrees C when the blast occurred today so [ρ = 1.2250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air).  There was also significant humidity that I didn't yet factor into ρ (mostly because it's getting late and I'm tired) that will reduce the density of air so I will leave it to the good people of r/physics to pick up my slack here.


Solving: If 1800m/s


e = A'*(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

e = (1)(3 ^ 5)(1.2250)(.00167 ^ -2)

e = 1x10 ^ 8 Joules


If 3000m/s is correct:

e = A'(r ^ 5)ρ(t ^ -2)

e = (1)(3 ^ 5)(1.2250)(.001 ^ -2) = 3x10 ^ 8 Joules


I'm too tired to figure out which types of explosive devices produce energy that fit in that range so I'll leave it for you to help me with.  Please correct me on any errors and hopefully we can help the NYPD bring these criminals to justice.

I am a graduate student in her lab and what I read in the comments was a little painful. I'm not at all bothered by those that claim no knowledge of physics and make very amusing comments about light sabers and Bose-Einstein Condensates being the power source for Bose Speakers (that was actually pretty funny). But I was shocked at how many semi-educated people made the claim that:

**when light enters matter, it is a bunch of tiny particles that get absorbed and emitted by the atoms randomly. The tiny particles still travel at the speed of light in between the atoms but the path length they follow is now much longer due to the scattering, similar to the [Drude model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model) for electrons. This is why light appears to slow down in a higher index material**

This is wrong. Very wrong.

Classically it would somehow say that Maxwell's equations require absorption/emission and atomic structure in some way. They do not. A free electron gas still has an index of refraction (so do plasmas and other non atomic systems). **Scattering destroys the coherency of light**. 

Quantum mechanically, the wavefuntion of an incoming ""photon"" (and I use that word very inappropriately here as all of these measurements use classical laser pulses) is not a ""tiny"" particle that can travel in between these huge atoms. Typical lasers today generate linewidths on a few hundred KHz, even in the Gaussian limit this leaves photon wavefunction's uncertainty in the k direction VERY large (think meters or km) not picometers.
This is a huge misconception and I hope we can, over time, ease people out of it.

This post had noting to do with EIT and or slow light. But I feel like I should also mention that slow light is not ""just shining a laser into a dense Bose-Einstein Condensate"" as some claimed. BEC's have densities MUCH lower than most solids and the index of refraction inside one is so close to 1 as to make no difference. 
I can do an /r/physics ama with some other members of the lab if you guys actually want to know more about slow light and EIT.

**edit**: Thank you all for your responses. I wrote this as a small rant on the misconception and didn't indent to make any claims as the true nature of the light matter interaction (a subject in which I feel comfortable enough to discuss but not comfortable enough to make any sure claims). I am extremely please with the responses and have actually learn quite a bit from them (particularly from seasidesarawack, that was very insightful). Just one more reason I love Reddit. Oh and for clarity when I said ""the wavefunction's uncertainty in the k direction"" I meant the spatial uncertainty in the direction the wave is traveling. seasidesarawack has stated that photons don't have spatial wavefunctions which I have never heard before but if its true then I may be just as guilt of spreading false insight as those I was ranting against.

**second edit**: after much discussion, I can have safely assert that all real world photons do have spatial wavefunction. Every real world photon has a center k value and a spread in k as well as a center position value and a spread in position. Often the photon will obtain the spatial mode of the cavity that formed it, so I stand by my original statement that a source with linewidth only a few 100 kHz cannot hope to make a pulse shorter than a several 100 meters. I really learned a lot from this discussion.

Upon completion, it was sealed into an envelope, where it remained until several years after his death.*edit to be more descriptive.

""October 17, 1946

D’Arline,

I adore you, sweetheart. 

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don't only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you. 

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you'll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing. 

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can't I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the ""idea-woman"" and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don't want to be in my way. I'll bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can't help it, darling, nor can I — I don't understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don't want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife, I do adore you. 

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don't know your new address.""

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jj801/gravity_may_be_an_emergent_property_not_a/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jj801/gravity_may_be_an_emergent_property_not_a/)

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jg10j/gravity_itself_may_be_emergent_properties_within/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jg10j/gravity_itself_may_be_emergent_properties_within/)

[http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jhpvv/new_study_by_scientists_at_the_university_of_york/](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jhpvv/new_study_by_scientists_at_the_university_of_york/) 


So notice all of these are in /r/science but none actually point to the paper. Luckily for us the Physical Review Letters allows for the author to host a copy on their personal website to be legally downloaded and read by anyone (not all journals allow this). 

Here is his personal website with a link to the paper:

[Prof. Braunstein's publications](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~schmuel/cv.html)

The relevant paper is publication #117 (the top one at the time of writing this).

Now, full disclosure: Prof. Braunstein is my supervisor, and when I mentioned that people were discussing his paper on Reddit he wanted me to make sure that you guys knew there was free and legal access to his paper. He also wanted me to pass on that in understanding equation #3 in his paper, it is crucial that you read the supplementary materials that is also linked on his page. He said equation #3 and its rationale are a crucial part of the result. 

So I made this post because I didn't think that /r/science linking to places like Huffington Post and judging the work based on an article written by a journalist that probably only read the abstract was the best way to have a well-reasoned discussion about the paper. 

I may be able to pass on questions to Prof. Braunstein but I can't promise I'll be able to in a timely matter as he may not be in very much this week.

1316888587.0	kq74x	Should meme posts ever be removed from /r/Physics?  A fair number of people have complained lately, so lets have a respectful discussion about this question.  	Fauster	373	93	112	"Currently, the policy is to not remove posts unless it's a question that someone could easily google.  However, a number of longtime contributors to discussions around here have complained about meme posts and asked that they be removed.  I'm somewhat sympathetic to this request, because most of reddit is now nothing but images.  If /r/physics goes the same direction, people who are actually in the field of physics may go elsewhere.  So, I was considering removing meme posts if multiple people report them, or if they aren't wildly popular after a couple of hours.

I would personally be happier if /r/phyiscs were purely scholarly and popular articles, but, so far, I've tried to go with Alexis Ohanian's philosophy, that you should never try to control the message in social media, and do nothing but approve autobanned posts. 

What do you guys think?

**Edit:**

It seems commenters want /r/physics to be a more serious/specialist-leaning subreddit, and this consensus will be supported.  Almost all but the most witty, profound and insightful memes will quietly be removed.  Report a post if you don't think it belongs here.  But as always, no one will be banned, and if your post gets no votes, it was probably autobanned [pm the mod]. 

For those who wanted the memes to continue, fear not.  I have a feeling scumbag neutrino and higgs boson mass jokes will continue to abound on other subreddits.  "	t5_2qhi6	True

1345463971.0	yip2d	Does an elliptical trainer trace out an ellipse?	8sleef	281	31	23	"So I was at the gym when the thought occurred to me: when you are on an elliptical trainer ([one of  these](http://www.gymratz.co.uk/images/cms/khronos-elliptical-trainer-dimensions.jpg)), do your feet  trace out ellipses? 

My gut feeling was 'not quite,' but I wasn't sure. I googled it, but no cigar. When I found some time I worked through the solution,  which turns out to be non-trivial. I needed Mathematica to do the job for me. For those interested, read  on! It's a fun derivation and I thought I would share it with you guys. Maybe it will inspire some other related questions or discussion. I wonder if gym equipment engineers optimise the equipment mathematically or by 'build and test'?

I set the problem up like so, with *(0,0)* and *(x,y)* fixed:

[Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/iiHdc.png).

I am interested in the locus that the red cross traces as the angle theta ranges from 0 to 2Pi.

In my notation, the coordinates of the red cross are:

    (d Cos[t] + r (p - d Cos[t]), d Sin[t] + r (q - d Sin[t]))

The coordinates *(p,q)* will obviously change as theta changes. The position of *(p,q)* will be given by the intersection of two circles: the first centred at *(d Cos[t] , d Sin[t])* of radius *l*; the second centred at *(x,y)* of radius *a*. There will be two intersection points, only one of which refers to the *(p,q)* we are interested in (the lower one). Thus, *p* and *q* satisfy the equations:

    (p - d Cos[t])^2 + (q - d Sin[t])^2 = l^2; 
    (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = a^2

We can solve simultaneously to find *(p,q)*, but the result doesn't look pretty! This is where Mathematica comes in for me. We can then plug these values back to find the coordinates of the red cross in terms of *(l,a,d,r,x,y,theta)*. Then we can parametrically plot for *theta=[0,2Pi]* given the following ""standard"" values I will estimate from [this picture](http://www.gymratz.co.uk/images/cms/khronos-elliptical-trainer-dimensions.jpg):
*l=1.5, a=0.5, d=0.2, r=0.5, x=1.5, y=0.5*.

The Mathematica output looks like this:

[Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/RQk5D.png)

There are the two solutions I was talking about. You're doing it wrong if your elliptical trainer traces out the upper solution! The physical solution is the blue one which is almost elliptical but not quite.

So there you have it: the answer in fact is 'not quite,' and depending on your parameters it might even be 'not at all.' For interest, here is how the plot changes as the parameters change. Some are interesting in the way they deviate from the ""standard"" shape (red):

[Figure 3](http://i.imgur.com/Cn7ro.png)

Any other neat geometrical problems you guys can think of, possibly involving gym equipment? I was eyeing off a strange looking stepping machine today...

1362959580.0	1a1tki	Decided to end with my Masters. Here's Why.	Luminescence9	295	75	102	"Preface: There has been a lot of talk on this subreddit about careers, plans, desires, education, schools, grad schools and aspirations. I figure I'd throw in my thoughts and plans since I haven't seen anything similar to mine posted yet.

I came to the realization that my life has largely been without adventure. I've never left the states, everything has been planned since high school and I haven't really had a major life experience. I recently turned 25, I have no job, no wife, no children and as soon as I get my masters, no more grad school. If I were to stay in grad school til I get my PhD., I'd be nearly 30 before I had my degree and chances are I'd have a wife, possible child, and a job lined up. Responsibility. 

As I see it, the next chance I'd have to travel and experience the world is when I was 60. Aged. I only have my 20's for 5 more years, it's now or never.

My current plan is to spend a month driving down to South America. Spend the following 6 months teaching in one of the 13 countries on the continent. I originally thought about going to Venezuela due to it being relatively close to the string of islands just North of the shore. But with the recent death of Hugo Chavez, it might not be the best plan at present. There are other options if need be.

This is an experience I view as being more valuable than a PhD. (since I'm hoping for a career outside of academia). Not only will I learn Spanish, Portuguese and possibly a little Italian. I will also get the chance to hone my ability as a photographer, add to my 5 years of teaching experience, teach a new subject (likely English) and submerge myself in a new culture (employers love multilingual cultured folk).

On top of this, I'm sick of classrooms, homework, tests, papers, campus, passionless students, uncaring professors, etc... Every day I'm sitting at my desk, in my office, grading or working on homework, I find myself daydreaming about sitting on a beach somewhere, fishing, drinking beer, driving my motorcycle up and down the coast, teaching students who care, hiking in the forest and swimming in the ocean.

I've worked hard to be where I am. But where I've ended up I'm not happy. I love the physics but I hate the stress. I'm ready to be done. I'm ready to see the world and grow as a person.

Does anyone else feel the same? Done what I've talked about? Suggestions from those who have?

Edit: On a positive note, I don't regret going to grad school. I'm really glad I pushed myself to move across the country to pursue a graduate degree, it has been challenging and rewarding. Plus, the peace of mind in knowing that I'll have a pretty awesome degree to fall back on if anything goes awry is awesome. And after this journey is over I'm extremely confident I will find an excellent job with little effort. In the end I hope to find work in the alternative energy market. Not sure what I'll do just yet, but I'm pretty sure it'll be awesome. Maybe setting up wind turbines in developing countries. That would be neat.

1374177646.0	1ikydy	A brief hello from Physics Today	PhysicsToday	242	35	58	"Hi all,

Those of you who are college students in the US and members of SPS, or professional physicists in a number of physics-related societies are probably familiar with Physics Today magazine. For those of you who aren't, we're a general physics magazine published by The American Institute of Physics.

In an effort to help spread the word about recent physics and to help the community of physics students, professionals, and interested laymen, we've decided to try to reach out to various online communities. We're already on Facebook and now we're turning to Reddit. We aren't trying to get subscriptions, we just want to share some of our content that we think would be interesting and helpful to the members of the /r/physics sub. Our online content ranges from brief discussions of new articles, to providing information about career and education path options, to highlighting government policies around the world that affect physicists. And we also publish online versions of the print magazine, but some of that content is paywalled (though there are occasional periods where we make all our content free), so I'm generally going to avoid posting the stuff the non-subscribers won't be able to access.

We don't plan on spamming the sub with content, and if there's an outcry against our being here, we'll happily (well, maybe not happily because we do so want to be loved) go away.

I'm also trying to convince one or more of our editors to do an AMA about physics publishing and other related topics. In the mean time, I'm happy to try to answer any questions about Physics Today and our being here."	t5_2qhi6	True

AnonPhysGrad	291	103	123	"Fellow physicists, I am writing this to seek your advice on how to deal with the overwhelming stress I am under, and to hopefully start a conversation on the role of testing in physics education. I've never before encountered this level of stress - if I do poorly today I will lose my financial support, practically forcing me to drop out and ending my academic career. 

I simply to not believe this test (or any traditional exam) will reflect my knowledge of the course material or my abilities as a physicist. Rather it will test my ability to memorize a set of equations and problem types and regurgitate them in a 3 hour window.

I've never been particularly good at memorization, and while I know memorization is a poor substitute for understanding I have no choice, as there will not be enough time to reason through problems or re-derive equations.

As a first year student at a top 20 public school I'm truly disappointed and frustrated by the emphasis on testing here. At my alma mater (also a top 20 public school) the undergraduate finals were 20-40%, and the grad courses I sat in on were almost entirely graded on homework. This seems to me to be a much more reasonable approach as doing homework is much more like doing real physics - digging through books and online resources, checking work in Mathematica, etc. (though book problems still leave much to be desired over projects or more open ended assignments). 

This subreddit has hosted some very good discussions recently on life as a grad student, and I'd like to hear your thoughts and advice on this issue. To the students in the process of choosing a PhD program, I urge you to consider how the weight of exams will effect you. I have found the anxiety unbearable.

Experimental particle physicists there have found hints of a discrepancy between the data and the Standard Model theory that is our current coherent theoretical formulation of human knowledge about particle physics.  (Hints I say, since it's only 3.4 sigma and we require 5 sigma for discovery.)

Three weeks ago, the BaBar experiment announced their findings with a talk at the [CIPANP 2012 conference](http://cipanp2012.triumf.ca/) in St. Petersburg, FL.  That's when it really got some buzz in the particle physics community, although actually BaBar uploaded [their paper to arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5442) a week earlier.  So technically this news is a month old...

**After the CIPANP conference, there were two very well-written and accessible blog posts that I know of, and it is to these links that I refer you for information:**

* **[Matt Strassler, an eminent particle theorist at Rutgers, writing on June 1](http://profmattstrassler.com/2012/06/01/a-violation-of-lepton-universality/)**

* **[Aidan Randle-Conde, a postdoc in the ATLAS experiment, writing on June 2](http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/06/02/how-to-discover-new-physics/)**

**I really think these are the best sources for accessible-but-not-dumbed-down information on what all those shitty press releases are talking about.**  I would probably be doing you a disservice if I were to put forth my own explanation, because then that might satisfy your curiosity and you wouldn't click on either of the links.  :P  **Go click on Matt Strassler's link, at least.  The ""short story"" version he has is only like 4 short paragraphs.**  

If you have questions I can attempt to answer them in the comments if you want.  Or you might be able to ask Strassler and Randle-Conde directly in their comments.

Oh, and also, why the recent surge of articles?  Well, some non-scientist science writer monkey at SLAC wrote up a [press release](https://news.slac.stanford.edu/press-release/babar-data-hint-cracks-standard-model) two days ago, and a bunch of even less qualified monkeys paraphrased and regurgitated it for a bunch of other shitty news outlets.  So there's your science journalism for you.

""Oh, our readers would never understand this at all, so we're going to rewrite things so it seems like we're on their side, the side of willful ignorance.""  BOLLOCKS, I SAY.

Furthermore, they've sensationalized their titles to imply that this is the first crack we've found in the Standard Model's impenetrable armor.  NONSENSE, I ALSO SAY.  Things the Standard Model can't explain include neutrino masses; dark matter; various CP-violating phases that must be measured and introduced by hand; where ~19 or so input parameters come from; how particles get their masses; how electroweak symmetry is broken; why the WW cross section doesn't violate unitarity at about 1 TeV; and if the last three are explained by a Higgs boson, how the Higgs boson's mass doesn't blow up from quadratic loop corrections.  And probably a lot more I don't remember.  The Standard Model works brilliantly and explains a lot... but for many decades, perhaps even from its first concept, people have known that there is more unknown physics lying at higher energies.

Also, if we thought the Standard Model was perfect, why would we have built the LHC in the first place?

**Every Thursday at 17:00 Geneva-time**, physicists and other scientists from [CERN](http://cern.ch/home) take to Google+ Hangouts to answer questions from the public about the research being done here. In the past, we have had scientists [explain the latest news on the Higgs boson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoDcQmodoq4), [talk about the LHC's worldwide computing grid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PQk48VLd8), [take school students on virtual visits to underground experimental caverns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyg9267Vkdk), and [tackle the question of extra dimensions (with special guests Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypMKjxUe0BE)).

We usually get the questions from Twitter (using [#askCERN](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23askCERN)) or from the comments in the YouTube stream. We haven't done this before, but we would also love to answer questions that /r/physics might have.

[Today's Hangout](https://plus.google.com/events/c6siviut81len830gkosiv5uo4c) is slightly less physics-heavy. Recently, CERN collaborated with [TED-Ed](http://ed.ted.com/) to produce five animations:

* [The beginning of the universe, for beginners](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-beginning-of-the-universe-for-beginners-tom-whyntie)
* [Dark matter: The matter we can't see](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/dark-matter-the-matter-we-can-t-see-james-gillies)
* [What happened to antimatter?](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happened-to-antimatter-rolf-landua)
* [Exploration on the Big Data frontier](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/exploration-on-the-big-data-frontier-tim-smith)
* [The basics of the Higgs boson](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-basics-of-boson-dave-barney-and-steve-goldfarb)

In ~5 hours, the scientists who wrote the scripts for and lent their voices to the animations as well as the animators who worked with them will get together to explain the aims of the project and answer questions about their respective topics.

I would be happy to present your questions to the scientists in today's Hangout. Send them to us in the comments to this post! When the event goes live, you can watch the video at three locations:

* [CERN's Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/+CERN)

Also bare with me, I'm a Chemist, albeit a physical chemist, not a Physicist.

I can't remember his name but I think he was head of the accelerator group at CERN. Anthony was his first name I think...

First off he said (without actually saying it) that they are close to detecting the Higgs Boson. They had a shut down scheduled for 2012 (for Armageddon I think) and  are considering postponing it because the people at ATLAS and CMS think that they will have enough data to confidently say they have detected it. He mentioned they are waiting for 3.5 sigma confidence before announcing  so I thought that implied that they already had *some* candidate detections. So don't expect an announcement this month, but perhaps this time in 2012...

He mentioned a few times how well the machine is running. Over the past 2 years they have ramped up the beam current (number of particles) and energy extremely fast (faster then planned). They have achieved a luminosity twice that which was predicted (ie the particle bunches have been squeezed smaller than they thought possible.

One cool fact he pulled up is that when they dump the beam they release 4 tetrawatts of power, for ~0.8 microseconds that it takes to dump the beam. This is roughly equal to the entire planets electricity generating capability.

Oh another thing he mentioned was how fast the data is being analysed, thanks to the [Grid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHC_Computing_Grid) and (probably more so) the hard work of A LOT of scientist. Often at conferences they have presented fully analysed data that was taken only a few days ago.

As you may have heard, yesterday was abuzz with news that the OPERA result was wrong by almost exactly the right amount to bring neutrinos right down to the speed of light due to a loose cable. But honestly, this makes little to no sense, not to mention, was accredited to anonymous sources.

For something like this, with rumors flying, before people get worked up, it is always a good idea to wait for news from the source. OPERA has released a statement which is included in [THIS](http://io9.com/5887601/cern-and-opera-address-loose-cables-effect-on-faster+than+light-neutrino-readings/) article which basically says that, yes there may be a cable situation, but there may also be another error that will affect the result in the opposite direction [making the neutrino velocity even faster than before]. These errors could cancel or could move the result in either direction.

These types of experiments [extremely high precision measurements] and will require several months to sort out the issues. Why? Because they want to be sure. They want to avoid silly news cycles based on speculation based on rumors. Unfortunately, not everyone sees it that way.

Even in the event that this result is nullified either at OPERA or Fermilab or Super-K or elsewhere, it still shows that the scientific method works. This is what science is all about. In undergraduate physics labs people are defying the basic laws of physics every day. Momentum isn't conserved, mass isn't conserved, etc. These aren't due to incorrect laws of physics, but incorrect measurements. Correctly done science, however, checks every component, looks for every possible source of error to explain the difficult result, and admits when they're wrong."	t5_2qhi6	True

When I went to get my book signed, I asked ""ever heard of reddit?""  He immediately asked if I had sent the email, and we discussed it a bit more. 

The fact is he seems interested, and wants to reach out, but doesn't know what the fuck reddit is.  How do you suppose we encourage him/motivate him to do it?  Honestly, he is not ancient, but old enough to not give a fuck about reddit.  His career is set...etc.  He needs to know that there isn't alot of risk, but I feel that he can only find out about what AMAs are at his own speed.

The class is introductory. It covers trig, kinematics, Newton's laws, work/energy/power, simple harmonic motion, a bit of electricity, and the last unit is a **very** brief intro to special relativity. 

The material is covered in a fairly novel way, which I thought /r/physics might be interested in seeing. Each unit tackles some big problem from the history of physics: for example in the first unit we learn trig as we figure out how to calculate the circumference of the earth using only shadows and some geography knowledge. 

I'm very excited about the class! It was a lot of fun to teach, and the students who have been active in the [discussion forum](http://forums.udacity.com/ph100) have been kind. 

But they aren't physicists! I would really love to have some feedback on the course, especially with regards to the effectiveness of the format that the material is presented in. Any thoughts would be appreciated, but I'm especially interested in a few questions:

* Are the motivating questions for each unit effective?
* Is the density of content appropriate?
* What about the density of quizzes? I'm worried they may be too frequent.

I know this is a lot to ask, and I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post this (I will happily move it to another subreddit if there is a more appropriate one), but I figured that some people here may be interested in checking out the course anyways.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions/feedback! Feel free to ask me any questions about Udacity and online education in general.

However at that time there were still some pretty serious concerns about its existence as the window of untested energies was really very small (or so I understood).  As that window closes everyone must be asking themselves.  So high energy physicists of reddit, how much of the standard model is broken if there is no Higgs Boson?  	t5_2qhi6	True

1342104400.0	wfyt5	As a physics PhD student, how should I interpret all the recent negativity towards Physics PhDs and academia/research jobs?	Snowtred	191	41	198	"I am currently high energy particle physics PhD student.  I am finished with my coursework and will receive my PhD in 1.5-2 years, but I am getting increasingly nervous about my career post-graduation.  The past few weeks in particular, I've seen posts such as:

[""Overproduction of Ph.D.s, caused by universities’ recruitment of graduate students and postdocs to staff labs, without regard to the career opportunities that await them, has glutted the market with scientists hoping for academic research careers""](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/we1k3/overproduction_of_phds_caused_by_universities/)

The general consensus on Reddit, even in r/physics, whose opinions I respect, seems to be that any physics student looking for a career in research is being overly optimistic.  And if they are expecting such a career, they are being entitled.  

Now before the last couple of these posts, I was sort of expecting a career in physics research.  Probably not a tenured position at a big university or anything, but after several years of graduate level physics, I still love physics research and the community surrounding it.  Once I leave my current university, soon, I'll have spent 9 years on my physics education and will have sacrificed a ton to get there.  Are my career outlooks really that bleak?  

I'm looking for some honest advice here, and any suggestions on how to improve my outlook on this.

The youtube movie shows a simulated view of a small black hole, if it were suspended in the air about a metre away from the camera. I wrote the simulation in Python, and used a spherical panorama image available online. In the movie clip, the camera is orbiting the black hole to show what the environment looks like as light is traveling through strongly curved spacetime close to the black hole. In some movie frames, a so-called 'Einstein ring' can be seen: this feature appears when there is an object exactly behind the black hole as seen by the camera. Light from this object passes around all sides of the black hole on its way toward us, forming a ring around its shadow.

Although this black hole is tiny (it has a Schwarzschild radius of about 1.8 centimetres), its mass is about twice that of Earth. Such a black hole would wreak havoc on our planet if it were to come in the vicinity of Earth. So, this is just a visualisation of how light would behave close to it, and not a full physical simulation of the other effects the black hole might have on its environment. :)"	t5_2qhi6	True

[Molecular vibration-sensing component in Drosophila melanogaster olfaction](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/02/08/1012293108.abstract)

&gt; A common explanation of molecular recognition by the olfactory system posits that receptors recognize the structure or shape of the odorant molecule. We performed a rigorous test of shape recognition by replacing hydrogen with deuterium in odorants and asking whether Drosophila melanogaster can distinguish these identically shaped isotopes. We report that flies not only differentiate between isotopic odorants, but can be conditioned to selectively avoid the common or the deuterated isotope. Furthermore, flies trained to discriminate against the normal or deuterated isotopes of a compound, selectively avoid the corresponding isotope of a different odorant. Finally, flies trained to avoid a deuterated compound exhibit selective aversion to an unrelated molecule with a vibrational mode in the energy range of the carbon–deuterium stretch. These findings are inconsistent with a shape-only model for smell, and instead **support the existence of a molecular vibration-sensing component to olfactory reception**."	t5_2qhi6	True
1371501142.0	1gjekn	The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity	naasking	198	55	111	"While not exactly a new paper, having been published in Found.Phys.Lett. 10 (1997) 43-60, I think the following paper deserves wider attention:

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9706018

Basically, most efforts to unify relativity and quantum mechanics start by assuming that the small-scale theory must necessarily be the more general foundation, and thus we must take a particular approach to quantizing gravity.

This paper takes the opposite approach by accepting the geometric basis of unrestricted general relativity without caveats. Thus, closed timelike curves are possible and a particle's quantum behaviour is simply due to solutions where it travels through time, ie. hitting a pool ball has a single possible classical trajectory, but a hitting a pool ball where an arbitrary number of wormholes are interspersed across the table can introduce a near infinite number of possible trajectories.

A more layman's introduction is linked to from the above paper:

http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9609021

Compelling predictions of this theory:

 * There is no quantum theory of gravity.
 * Classical objects are possible. The peculiar 4-geon structures give rise to quantum effects; if these are absent then classical deterministic evolution would occur.
 * There is no graviton. This follows from either of the statements above. Gravitational waves are topologically simple solutions of Einstein’s equations without CTCs. Therefore they cannot exhibit quantum phenomena such as wave particle duality. Gravitational waves are not quantised.

So really, quantum mechanics and relativity already have an expression in a unified theory in our familiar 3+1 dimensions, it's just not well known and we just haven't been able to derive useful solutions due to the difficulties of relativity's field equations.

The conceptual simplicity of this approach is certainly appealing, and it would certainly explain the persistent difficulties in finding a proper quantum theory of gravity."	t5_2qhi6	True

I told them no. But truthfully, there is no way in hell I am going to pass this project unless I am regularly asking my supervisor for pointers. 

I feel like there is a *huge* stigma if I ask my supervisors for pointers.

Over the past week, taking the entire community by surprise, administration has threatened to cut departments and programs with low graduation rates. More specifically, they are threatening to cut basically all physics programs; new students would not have the option of pursuing a bachelor's degree in physics if such a cut were to occur. After current students earn their degrees, it is likely only general physics courses would remain to be offered, and only three out of ten faculty would be able to keep their jobs.

Aside from the fact that our department is graduating twelve or thirteen students this May, **and** the fact that our department has seen a general increase in physics majors over the past ten years, **and** the fact that we have set up international programs to recruit students to pursue physics degrees at our university, **and** we bring in lots of money in grants, we are **still** likely to be cut if we do not quickly change members of the administration and state government's minds. The cuts are being made simply on the basis of what they judge to be ""low enrollment,"" not the true worth of programs. In fact, according to APS, 94% of all physics departments across America graduate ten or less students per year. Eliminating our department would make no sense.

Cutting fundamental science programs from a public university is preposterous, right? Even the chemistry department is on the chopping block. Does [/r/physics](/r/physics) have any suggestions as to what our faculty and students can do? We have been active in local media, active in writing members of our administration and state government, and active in creating awareness that this is a really bad idea.

1360539166.0	189usr	Why you should memorize your damn formulas		182	49	32	"All of these formula sheets on the front page have been getting kind of ridiculous. Granted, one of the first mantras you learn about physics is that if your experience in the field/class amounts to memorizing formulas and plugging in numbers to get answers, then not only will you not actually understand anything, but you will fall quickly behind. However, if you really have to write down Maxwell's equations for an EM test, then it seems to me like you're doing something wrong. 

Understanding and being able to derive equations from more fundamental principles is of course foremost in learning physics but you should memorize things too. After all, if you understand a formula and know its derivation more or less, then memorizing it really won't be too hard. Further, if you commit a formula to memory, then you can look at it and think about it whenever you want, instead of just when you have your textbook open. It seems to be common knowledge on Reddit that great epiphanies happen in the most unexpected circumstances, like in the shower, or standing at the bus stop, or right before falling asleep. Therefore, with a formula in your mind instead of on a piece of paper that you left on your desk, you can ruminate on it at a lot more short frequent intervals (rather than in one long boring study session), and believe it or not, your understanding of it will advance in short, unexpected bursts of knowledge. It will be almost like memorizing a poem; you'll have it with you forever and every day you will see it more clearly and in a more beautiful light. 

The second big reason for memorizing formulas is that when you have an equation immediately accessible to you, you will start to see connections much faster between material you've already learned and material you're encountering for the first time, and the toolbox you have for working with unknown concepts will be much larger. Having to look up the equation for the gravitational force in order to see that it is very similar to the Coulomb force, or having forgotten about the 3D continuity equation you learned in EM when you see a new high dimensional phase-space continuity equation appear in statistical mechanics, will severely limit your understanding and your ability to see the more fundamental unities between physical laws, and your appreciation of how beautiful physics really is will not mature nearly as quickly as it otherwise could.

Okay, well this doesn't mean that you have to memorize the Green's function for every conductor geometry you've ever seen or all the fundamental constants to ten digits, but seriously, as long as it's in addition, instead of in place of, your understanding, memorization will seriously help you out. It may seem a little daunting at first, but trust me, you will get better at memorizing as time goes on. In fact, even in your attempts to make mnemonics you will probably discover an organization to what you've learned that you hadn't ever considered. Lastly, if nothing else, you will have a better memory, and I can't think of any case where that would be a bad thing."	t5_2qhi6	True

I have already posted this under /r/math, not really understanding what it was. I have received a recommendation to post this under the /r/physics sub-reddit as it appears to pertain to general relativity.

The original submission along with some discussion can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/upf7a/found_on_a_gravestone/).

My sister is currently working in a graveyard. During her break she stumbled across a gravestone that contains only the names of what appears to be a husband and wife along with the following -

    Died:
    R _{abcd} = \frac{1}{12} \delta _{ab}^{pq} \delta _{cd}^{rs} \pi _{pr}^{eg} \pi _{qs}^{fh} R _{efgh}

A cropped photo with the deceased's names removed can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/nksUY.jpg), just in case my LaTeX syntax is way off.

She texted me the photo asking if I was able to tell her when these people died, but I wasn't even sure where to start.
I'm wondering if there are any helpful persons out there who would be able to satisfy our morbid curiosity with this one.

If you have any questions please ask, but out of respect for the dead I will not reveal the names on the gravestone.

TL;DR, Math on gravestone instead of date. We would like to know when they died."	t5_2qhi6	True

What happens from here anyway? Are many experimentors going to try to replicate it? Or is it going to be acknowledged one prominent centre say, Fermilab is going to try and their results are the ones we'll wait for?

Also lets say there is an error in their paper.

1304188098.0	h0xud	Dark Matter vs. Dark Energy or why the current nomenclature is terrible	spartanKid	143	17	91	"Dark Matter and Dark Energy seem to get lumped together a lot as placeholders for stuff we just don't know anything about. Yet, the two are vastly different in terms of our understanding and the theoretical and experimental work done with respect to each of them.

We see evidence for Dark Matter in all different scales of the Universe from all different epochs. The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), suggest the existence of a nearly collision-less, gravitationally interacting, but not electromagnetically interacting particle fluid in the early primordial plasma. The Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum also hints at the existence of significantly more non-baryonic matter in the Universe. Having a flat Universe entirely made up of Baryons does not fit the power spectrum measured by COBE or WMAP. Using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which relies on very well understood nuclear and atomic physics, predicts certain ratios and abundances of H, He and Li in the Universe, the concentrations of which would be distorted by the presence of extra baryonic matter. Strong Gravitational Lensing requires the existence of much more matter than we can measure using luminosity and other measurements. Lastly, the most commonly cited reason is that measured galaxy rotation speeds do not match those predicted by GR and Newtonian physics.

Fitting and reproducing galaxy rotation curves is where MOND or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, was born. The problem with MOND is that it requires several different parameters and cutoff scales to be able to explain the BAO, CMB, Grav Lensing, BBN, and rotation curve measurements. Basically if you want your MOND theory to work at a certain level, you have to introduce 4 other modifications to physical theory for everything to work out. Allowing for the existence of a dark matter particle is the simplest and most reductionist view of ""dark matter problem"".

There have been many candidates for the particle dark matter. A very early candidate were MACHOs, or Massive Compact Halo Objects, things like black holes that were extremely massive, normal baryonic matter, but didn't absorb or emit light. Even when accounting for black holes and other MACHOs, they don't make up enough energy-mass density to fix the dark matter problem. 

WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, are popular dark matter candidates because they're some of the easiest dark matter candidates to detect. If the particles do interact through the weak force, then they have some low but non-zero coupling constant with the nuclei of atoms, meaning they can collide and scatter. This is the basic premise of experiments like CDMS (II), XENON100, and DAMA/LiBRA, etc. 

Other dark matter candidates, like Axions, sterile neutrinos, etc. are not pursued as heavily or as publicized because it's really much more difficult to detect them, directly or indirectly. 

If the dark matter candidate only interacts gravitationally, then we're basically screwed, and have almost no way of being able to detect them directly.

Right now is an exciting time because of the coming of age of the LHC, and the insights into Super Symmetry, (SUSY). The dark matter candidate is often thought to be a susy partner to one of the existing standard model particles we know and love. The LSSP, or lightest stable supersymmetric partner, in many SUSY models is an excellent dark matter candidate. The energies of the LHC are just now reaching the point where they're parameter space overlaps with upcoming direct detection dark matter experiments.

So, while the dark matter name sounds mysterious and is often termed a place holder for stuff we don't know about, we do in fact, know an awful lot about the properties of dark matter and have finitely many models and theories waiting to be confirmed or disproven from the LHC and DM direct detection experiments. 

**EDIT**: Dark Energy is what we believe to be the other ~74% of the Universe, assuming that we are correct with our flat, Omega = 1 Universe. We see Dark Energy as some sort of vacuum-energy that is pushing the Universe apart on the largest scales. Early in the Universe, during radiation domination, we could expect to see the Universe expanding outward due to the immense radiation pressure and heat. Common intuition would lead one to believe the expansion of the Universe would slow down once we reach the matter dominated regime, and the gravity starts to pull everything back together. However this does not appear to be the case, and objects that are further away are receding faster and faster as a function of redshift. We name this mysterious driving force and the other 74% of the energy-mass density to be ""Dark Energy""

Dark energy is much more of a mystery than dark matter, and is possibly the weirdest thing we've even ""seen"". How can a substance maintain constant energy density while it's volume increases? What kinds of substances do this? Yes we do have experiments in the works like JEDI and JDEM, but we're no where near the same level as experiments looking to constrain dark matter. 

So please, in the future, keep in mind that dark energy and dark matter are surely not the same thing, and that our confidence in the existence of dark matter is much higher than our confidence level in any statement we can make about dark energy, except for that something out there exists that maintains constant energy density, even under expansion of the Universe. 


**DOUBLE EDIT:** I certainly hope that when we find out more about DM and DE, we start calling them different things, WIMPs, axions, sterile neutrinos, quintessence, vacuum energy, etc.

What is it with TV shows and their ideas on what scientists are like that is? I mean, CSI and Bones are so off-base it's not even funny. Do tv writers have that little idea of real scientists or are they deliberately playing up to the general public's stereotypes?

Now I know that we can get electrons flowing through our antennae in order to resonate with the frequency being transmitted by our radio towers.  My stumbling block is, how then, when we have our antenna matching the frequency of our transmitter, do we then also transmit the information?

Is it that the resonant frequency is relatively small compared to the frequency of the information (audio, in this case) being transmitted, so that our antenna is picking up quick oscillations on time-scales too short to interfere with the resonant oscillations?

I feel like such a failure because I haven't really been able to convince myself confidently of the physics behind this process.

Edit: I thought of another confusing aspect:  What is it about resonance that allows the antenna to receive this data?  Is it better simply think of it as if it were a solitary electron oscillating back and forth so that it is in the same ""temporal"" position as the transmitter, and is, as a result, in the proper ""position"" to be affected by the transmitter's perturbance?

HomelessGinger	132	23	58	"Hey, I'm not sure if this is the place to ask this and I'm sure it has been asked before, but what is a life in physics like? I am currently in my 2nd year of university studying physics and the more I hear people talk, the more discouraging everything seems. I spend a fair amount of time in one of the science buildings doing homework, and I overhear a lot of upper-years and professors. The more I hear, it seems like those in academia are less involved with science than I first thought. It sounds like a lot more time is spent repeatedly writing for grants, struggling to meet deadlines, and figuring out logistical issues than actually focusing on material. Is it worth busting one's ass off to get through all these years of schooling to try and land a job with long hours and tedious deadlines? I understand if someone enjoys teaching, but what if someone if more research oriented? Even if I am excited by physics and am curious how the world works, will a career in physics be fulfilling? I know it will mostly be whatever I make of it, but I am curious to hear what you guys have to say. Sometimes I almost feel like I should just go into medecine or something that pays decently, manage my money well, and just create my own lab in a garage somewhere, where I could do whatever the hell I like. Also as an aside, are there many interesting physics based careers outside of research and academia with possible room for advancement? Thanks for any of your thoughts.

Could such differences explain the missing gape between the atomic theory and the theory of relativity?

I took my first intro class this year and just went nuts... I jumped a full year ahead in the math curriculum so I can take more physics before getting to college. But nevertheless I feel like I'm not doing enough physics. I miss the thrill of taking on a gargantuan problem, and the pleasure of uncovering new things in the process. I'm probably not looking hard enough, there've got to be good problems out there. But I'm hoping that some of you also just want to do more problems for the fun of it. I propose starting /r/physicsproblems. Everyone just posts their favorite problems, and solutions in the comments. We can even have like a weekly challenge of some absurdly hard problem, the first correct solver of which can have their username permanently enshrined somewhere on the reddit. Drop a comment if you're interested, and I'll start the reddit with enough backing.'

This is not true, and while all of these claims have negative karma, the responses are often varied, sometimes inconcise, and usually difficult to understand for individuals that do not already understand entanglement.

To make this as simple as possible, let's say there is a particle, at rest, with a spin of zero. The particle decays into two other particles, each in a superposition of spin=1 and spin=-1. These particles are entangled. When you measure the spin of one particle, it's wavefunction collapses to the observed state. Let's say we find that it's spin is 1. The moment we observe this, the other particle's wavefunction collapses as well, and as soon as its spin is observed, we, at the first particle, know that it will be -1. The collapse of the wavefunction happens instantaneously, without regard for the speed of light. This has been experimentally proven

Here is the thing. I observe the first particle, lets call it particle A, and it has a spin of 1. That means that that moment, particle B, even light-years away, has spin -1. However, as far as anyone that can observe particle B knows, I haven't yet observed particle A. They observe particle B, and they see the spin is -1. They have no idea if I have observed particle A yet. If you think that we could make it so that particle B is in an apparatus that would register when the wave-function is collapsed, that would not work, because in order to monitor changes in B, you have to be observing B, which would collapse the wavefunction immediately.

It is also important to note, that as soon as these wavefunctions collapse, the particles no longer have anything to do with each other. Changing B will not change A. If you measure A has a spin of 1, measure something else about A, and then find A has a spin of -1, B still has a spin of -1, unless something has independently acted on B to change it.

Any constructive criticism would be appreciated, I'll edit it in. Also, if you know the name of the experimental proof that the wavefunctions collapse instantaneously, can you comment with a link?"	t5_2qhi6	True

I saw a couple of days ago the exciment behind the publication of the Higgs search papers from ATLAS and CMS and I wanted to make a few comments. Let me know what you think.

My main point is: nowadays in high-energy physics, the process of getting published a paper in a journal is NOT a major milestone when it comes to its science. I'll try to convince you about this.

Although I'm not a member of ATLAS or CMS I can tell you how the reviewing process usually works inside a big collaboration: First, once you have your analysis ready, you usually send it to a working group inside the collaboration, this is a small set of people that have worked on something similar to what you're doing. For example, you may be looking for a Higgs to 2 photons, so there may be a ""diphoton working group"" that deals with all these analyses. If you have something very important, like a five sigma (very statistically significant) discovery, they will be shooting questions from every angle (was your simulation right? have you made sure that your cuts are not biasing your result? etc etc). The questions from this group are usually the best, since they know what you're dealing with AND they know the detector too. Here you already have a ""peer-review"" process even before publication.

Then, if you have answered all questions to the satisfaction of the people in the working group, you may submit your analysis for review by the entire collaboration. For this you may need some backup (your advisor, your colleagues at your institution that know about your work) because if you have a juicy result somebody may want to attack it for political reasons (this happens in science as in any other place, gasp!). If your results are good and you've done your homework you won't have major problems passing this step.

Now you write the paper, you send it around the working group and collaboration again. People submit comments, suggestions, questions. There's a lot of peer-reviewing in this phase too.

OK, so now your paper is done. You select a journal (PLB for instance, as in the case of the Higgs papers) and you submit it. The journal editors take your paper and look for anonymous reviewers. These are people that are outside of your collaboration but know (hopefully, a lot) about the subject at hand. How many reviewers does a usual paper get? 2, or 3. I don't know if this is true in the case of the Higgs papers but that's it!

At the same time, as you submit to the journal you also submit a preprint of the paper to the [arxiv](http://www.arxiv.org). A repository of paper preprints that today everybody uses as their main source of information (at least in high-energy physics and astrophysics). By then, you already had your press conference if you're doing something as important as a Higgs search result, and theorists will try to come up with explanations as to why what you're seeing is what they've been predicting all along (and sometimes they're right! double-gasp!). Also, some experimentalists may try to argue that you did something wrong. Maybe not. For the Higgs, this step happened on July 31st. 

From July 31st until a few days ago the paper underwent the journal review. More comments were submitted and some were incorporated with some clarifications in the text of the paper. Now comes the publication and the realease of the journal version of the paper. Usually people will update the arxiv with the latest version of the paper.

Here's then my point: Since the birth of the very first draft of the paper, the results have been under the evaluation of, first, many tens of people that know exactly what you're talking about, and know exactly what your detector can and can not do. Then it goes to thousands of people (like for the LHC experiments) where it is reviewed again, also by people who can very easily detect problems in your analysis because they work with the same data, on the same experiments, and you meet them regularly maybe twice a year in a big meeting and also have phone conferences with them. You'll be under attack for a while there.

Then you move to a journal and 2 (two) people who don't know all the details of your data or your detector argue with you until you get some references in, or a typo out, or want to see a bit more verbose version of your explanation of something, or want to see a different plot.

Guess where the ""actual science"" happened?

I'm not downplaying the importance of the reviewing process, it is central to all fields of basic science, but we should not overrate it either. In the case of the LHC results, the reviewing started a long time ago, and I'm almost certain not much changed between the arxiv submission and the journal publication. 
For somebody in physics who's not in the LHC, what's the importance of them passing the peer-review? That you must change your references in your future papers from (arxiv/1234.5678something) to PLB 234 (23) 2012 or something like that. Really, that's all that there is.

Sorry for the long rant, I was just trying to give some context.

TL;DR: Passing peer-reviewing for the ATLAS and CMS results is a non-event in terms of what it means for everybody else in physics.

And Galilleo teaches that the acceleration due to gravity an objects feels is dependant only on its distance from said object, and said object's mass. 

So in the case of Earth, its acceleration towards the sun relies only on its distance from the sun (which flutuates, but is otherwise constant) and the mass of the sun (which is continually decreasing, and has been for the last four billion years).

Now I understand the amount of hydrogen which goes in is almost equal in mass to the amount of helium which comes out, but surely over hundreds of millions of years there would be a significant decrease in the mass of the sun, wouldn't there?

Dear ________,
 
I invite you to take 5 minutes of your time and visit my website. I was recommended to contact you by your co-worker, ________. I appreciate his effort and interest to have a scientific interview with channel _. I believe that I have found and copyrighted(2010-2011) these new break-through formulas relating to the speed of light, gravity, and other very important universal formulas. I have sent my formulas to NASA also and am waiting for a response. I am hoping that you take interest in my formulas and let the public know about this new information. Please click on the website highlighted below and then click on introduction/all to see all my formulas.

 
You will realize the importance of my formulas and recognize how the country and NASA could benefit by a better, cheaper and faster progress in Science development by using these copyrighted (2010-2011) formulas in schools, colleges, universities, scientific institutes and NASA programs.
 
On my website, I have explained the following topics;
First:    The new speed of light formula for the first time in Science history.
 
              V2=R” x g x V/ 3600     V= 189,540  ml/s
 
Second: three new gravity formulas based on the planet radius, and    
rotational speed, unlike Newton’s theory that is based on mass and the distance between 2 objects.

     a- Gravity=2(Planet Density x Planet Radius) / (Planet Speed x Air Radius)=2 (D x R) / (Vs x R’) = 9.7979

     b- Gravity= 4 (p x RVc / R’Vs) = 9.7979

     c- Gravity = 2 (R’ / Vs) = 9.797

My result of my formulas show that the gravity for;
             Earth =9.7979, Moon =1.6, Sun= 256

Third: The Sun has no effect or gravity attraction to a planet because
the sun’s gravity radius is 577,679 miles, all nine planets in our solar system
run with 576 ml/h towards the sun, not matter of their size, speed, radius or
gravity. My formula proves how many miles each planet will get closer to the
sun. For example the earth will get closer 2,511,600 miles to the Sun.
I am proud, honored and glad to present and explain my formulas.
I am proud to inform you that after 400 years of when Newton’s formula was
first made, I have made a new formula which explains the Newton’s
gravitational constant. And I explained why all (9) planets get close to the sun.
This email has been sent to your co-workers and other channel _ reporters.
Please let me know if you would like to schedule an interview.
I look forward to your response.
Thank you

1320713948.0	m47en	What's the deal with extra dimensions?	McDarling	123	22	81	My understanding goes like this: gravity is mysteriously weaker than all the other forces, by a lot. So, some people think that gravitons (but none of the other gauge bosons) are being lost into extra dimensions, causing the interaction to be lessened. Why can gravitons go into these dimensions, but not photons, guons, or W and Z bosons?	t5_2qhi6	True
1309069704.0	i9en0	Can’t get a job with a PhD in physics, what to do now? (sorry if massive repeat)	AteTooMuchBanana	145	45	233	"I defended my PhD thesis in August last year. My thesis involved testing sensors that I made in a nanofab clean room. 

Problem is I only got null results and I got my qualifications all from the same no-name university. No results = no papers. 

There seem to be several jobs which I appear to be suited to, skillwise at least, however I am constantly ignored after applying. I put this down to my lack of publications and poor quality of my university.  I have looked in the UK, Europe and Australia. I started applying for jobs in companies rather than universities/research institutes but, just like during my thesis experiments, I have yielded null results. I can’t program so I can’t go into finance. 

So I have to wonder what I can do now? I am having a hard time figuring out what I can do with my physics qualifications. If I can’t do research then I can’t think of anything I can do except for minimum wage unskilled work (which I am currently employed doing).

I suppose what gets me down is that I’ve work hard all through high school and university so that I wouldn’t have to earn minimum wage and therefore not have to struggle from paycheque to paycheque. I will keep on trying but if you guys have any ideas for what a PhD in physics can do that’s not research/lab work let me know. Thanks for your advice.

**TL:DR** No papers from PhD = minimum wage job. What else can I do?

I mean I understand the whole realistic aspect of becoming involved in academia and what not but can we just not rejoice in the career and great opportunities physicists have after getting a PhD. Even if you barely scraped into academia you should feel some sort of sympathy some of these people are going through having barely have made it in - and you could probably provide the best perspective on alternative jobs. I'm just trying to get a positive thread for once, a thread that inspires physics PhD graduates without making them feel inadequate just because they didn't get into a top 20 program or didn't succesfully get a job in Academia. I know we are all a bit cynical after dealing with years of not feeling good enough to be that physicists you dreamed of but how about we rejoice in the accomplishments and opportunities us PhD physics students have compared to any other degree. I just want to end this rant about being positive for once with a Feynman quote.

*""The question is what to do if you find you're below average. There are two possibilities. In the first place, you could find that it's so difficult and annoying that you have to get out-that' s an emotional problem. You can apply your rational mind to that and point out to yourself what I just pointed out to you : that half of the guys in this place are going to be below average, even though they're all tops, so it doesn't mean anything. You see, if you can stick out that nonsense, that funny feeling, for four years, then you'll go out into the world again, and you'll discover that the world is just like it used to be-that when, for example, you get a job somewhere, you'll find you ' re Number One Man again, and you'll get the great pleasure of being the expert they all come running to in this particular plant whenever they can't figure out how to convert inches to centimeters ! It's true : the men who go out into industry, or go to a small school that doesn't have an excellent reputation in physics, even if they've been in the bottom third, the bottom fifth, the bottom tenth of the class-if they don't try to drive themselves (and I'll explain that in a minute), then they'll find themselves very much in demand, that what they learned here is very useful, and they're back where they were before : happy, Number One ."" - Feynman*"	t5_2qhi6	True

This got me thinking. My brain is automatically resolving spherical coordinates based on several inputs from 2 acoustic sensors. The variables are:

1. The timing of the received signals.
2. The magnitude of each signal received.
3. The frequency of the signal received. 

This third input is very interesting. If we position an acoustic sensor on the other side of a semi-permeable structure, we can then quantify the amount that the signal is muffled to use as a clue for direction. I had never thought about this but is a genius design. Simply put, if an object is directly behind you vs directly in front, the magnitude of the signal may be the same, but you detect it as being behind because of the ""muffling ratio"". I just made that term up. What do you think? Am I crazy?

[Here is part 1 of the video, which I uploaded a few weeks ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K6YymPe_M)

Let's just say part 2 is better.  I capture the complete ""flight"" of the bullet under water... all the way till it stops.  So here's my question.  The bullet creates a trail behind it that is pretty amazing. [Check out the 4th row of pictures on this website by Dr. Andrew Davidhazy to visualize what I'm talking about](http://people.rit.edu/andpph/exhibit-3.html).  Obviously there's a low pressure zone behind the bullet, right?  So here's the deal.  When I fired the bullet underwater and watched the entire ""flight"" underwater, the bullet creates a pocket of air behind it, that then collapses.  Originally I thought the gasses from the bullet casing would project out into the bullet's flight trail, but it's really looking like the entire wake area collapses after a few hundred milliseconds, leading me to believe the entire void is cavitation.  **After it collapses, it slams in to nothing, then it re-expands.  This re-expansion is what has me confused.**  I'm thinking it's an interaction of the collapsing pressures in a fluid momentum like fashion, similar to how a collapsing magnetic field will create it's own current if near a conductor.  Either way, it's freaking awesome, but I really want to explain the science correctly.  My intent is to pull up a [phase diagram for water](http://serc.carleton.edu/images/research_education/equilibria/h2o_phase_diagram_-_color.v2.jpg) and explain why it turns to vapor, but why it crosses back over to water then re-vaporizes is something I only have a theory on... but have no absolute knowledge of.  If the discussion kicks up good enough, maybe I'll post a heavily watermarked version of the video in question for explanation purposes.


Please help me think about this.  Is my 'subtracting pressure waves' theory accurate?  Basically like fluid interference.

I'm a physics PhD student at UC Berkeley who is also a teacher and leader for the [Compass Project](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/), a student-run organization that's doing a lot of cool stuff to promote community, diversity, and better education in physics. It was started in 2006 by a few grad students who ran a summer program in 2007 for about 10 incoming freshmen, and now the program serves over 100 graduate and undergraduate students every year. We have a summer program, semester-long courses, a mentoring program, etc., all run by and for students.

If you're a student in a department with a generally negative culture (e.g., doesn't support community, diversity, or education) then you should [contact](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/contact/) people in Compass to get an idea for how you can effect change even if you're not faculty or staff. We've got over 6 years of experience growing a program and supporting it through tough financial times, and we'd love to share our story with you!

We're already partnering with a university in Florida, who put on a summer program in 2012, and a university in New York, who just submitted a grant proposal for a summer program. Some of us will be moving to Phoenix in 2013 to adapt our program for pre-college students (i.e., K-12).

There are several metrics which suggest that we're successful: we won the [APS Physics award](http://www.aps.org/programs/education/undergrad/faculty/awardees.cfm) for Improving Undergraduate Physics Education; we did a [qualitative study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6848) to show that our students feel like they're part of a strong community that supports them holistically as learners and people; we're really [diverse](http://www.berkeleycompassproject.org/about/by-the-numbers/), with summer students being 45% women, 30% minority, and 19% first-generation college students; and we have an awesome STEM degree completion rate of 84%, which is more than twice the national average of [40%](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf). (Note: the degree completion stats on the website haven't been updated yet to reflect degrees to be awarded in Dec 2012.)

If this is true I could press the button as many times as I want, and from my perspective the gun would never fire, because in the realties it did i'd be dead. Someone could do this to themselves and from their perspective never die, in addition they would effectively prove split universe theory in that version of reality. They might even win the noble prize or some such.

Is this possible or am I waaaay off and sounding like an idiot right now?"	t5_2qhi6	True

1342007208.0	wdpmj	Is this a correct explanation of why water flows out of an upside-down bottle (Rayleigh Taylor Instability)	alexgmcm	109	17	20	"I am currently reading the excellent book [An Indispensable Truth: How Fusion Power Can Save the Planet by Francis F. Chen](http://www.amazon.com/An-Indispensable-Truth-Fusion-Planet/dp/1441978194/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342006954&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=indispensable+truth) and I came across this explanation.

&gt;**The Rayleigh–Taylor Instability**

&gt;When you turn a bottle of mineral water upside down, the water falls out even though the atmospheric pressure of 15 lbs./sq.in is certainly strong enough to support the water. This happens because of an instability called the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.5. 

&gt;If the bottom surface of the water remained perfectly flat, it would be held by the atmospheric pressure. However, if there is a small ripple on the surface, there is slightly less water pressing on the top of the ripple than elsewhere, and the balance between the weight of the water above the ripple and the atmospheric pressure is upset. The larger the ripple grows, the greater is the unbalance, and the ripple grows faster. 

&gt;Eventually, it grows into a large bubble which rises to the top, allowing water to flow out under it. If you hold the end of a straw filled with water, the water does not fall out because surface tension
prevents the interface from deforming like that.

[Here is the mentioned Figure 5.5.](http://i.imgur.com/aZhgK.png)

It seems intuitive and a nice interesting bit of physics, but it's strange because I've never heard of this explanation before and with some searching this is the only place I've been able to find it which seems odd. So is it correct? I mean Chen is one of the most prestigious plasma physicists so I don't doubt his physics skill but he is writing for laymen and perhaps simplified beyond what is technically true in order to better demonstrate the principle of instability?"	t5_2qhi6	True

I'm great at Physics. I love the material I've learned; I'm skilled in math; I know Classical, thermodynamics, E&amp;M, Modern, and special relativity - I'm learning Quantum next year. I feel like I'm really well rounded. 

The only real ""focus"" I have is my Astronomy interest.

I don't really want to teach, but I'd love to do some kind of research or work. Is that doable without grad school?

I've also been told by employees that Boeing and Microsoft would be good choices (I'm in Washington State). 

My advisor isn't familiar enough with the field to tell me what I can or can't do, and the professors I've talked to have mostly just recommended I go to career fairs (and I have) and look around for what most interests me and to then come back to them.

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience applying for a Ph.D again after working in industry (electrical engineering) for 3-4 years? I am a 2011 grad in EE/CS and Physics, and I am currently working in Verification in Silicon Valley. I want to go back to get an advanced degree (probably a Ph.D) and am seriously considering doing a hard science instead of engineering like I did in undergrad. This is because for my undergrad research I worked as an engineer in a science lab, and I wanted to do more of the experiment design kind of things. How difficult is it to do, especially since my academic stats were not that impressive (2.93 GPA, probably 2 letters of rec I can count on, 2 years of undergrad research in engineering)?

Edit: Just wanted to add that I also do want to work in semiconductor device physics, and that's why I want to get a Ph.D, but I was thinking of doing more of the physics type grad work rather than engineering.

Hey guys, I'm a professional game developer trying to prototype some ideas for my next game, i really don't have a background in the math side of science at all though but i am looking to do this well.

The game is going to involve defending your planet from incoming asteroids, and funding the missions by collecting space junk and launching commercial satellites, this means i need the ai to actually use the correct maths to do the maneuvers. 

I'll start with the first problem then once we get that fixed I'll have some harder and probably more interesting problems :).

* ~~First Problem:~~

Solved! I wasn't normalizing my direction vector so it was screwing up the simulation. 
http://snag.gy/M34zp.jpg

Ok onto the stuff that i don't understand fully understand

* Second problem:
Ok so i worked on this all yesterday, and i think my problem is partly i don't know exactly what equations will help me here.

What would be the best method to predict the orbit, essentially replicating this line http://snag.gy/M34zp.jpg, without just tracing the orbit per frame? It needs to be fast enough to run per frame as well. 

On-top of that It would be helpful to mathematically be able to tell how far an orbit is off being perfectly circular, and tell if the orbit is decaying, stable or hyperbolic.

EDIT: THANKS!!! The help here has been overwhelming. 

The prototype is coming along, and i now have what seems be all the information i need for now. I might need more help when i come to write ai that can simulate moving rockets, i dont need that to make the first version of the prototype. 

I'll make a new thread when i have something cool for you guys to play with.

TrevorBradley	111	25	112	"First of all, this isn't a homework question, my degree is long past.  It's just a thought that's stuck in my head that I was unable to answer with my puny minor in Physics.

Suppose you take a flashlight and shine it on your face on a clear midnight summer sky for a full 60 seconds.  A fraction of the photons will reflect off your face (facial albedo?), a fraction of those will make it through the atmosphere and out into space.  And a fraction of those will continue to pass outwards past the solar system without being reabsorbed by gas.  I would assume a tiny fraction will pass into intergalactic space tens of thousands of years from now.

Here's my question: How long would you need to shine that flashlight on your face for there to be a 99% chance of those photons surviving to the heat death of the universe?

For example, helo moving @ 100 mph, person running at 5 mph, you should shoot 'behind' them so your shot hits them considering the initial velocity in the direction of travel of the helo is equal to the speed of the helo.

Sea_Bitch	116	34	71	"I have some friends in my year who don't understand or try to understand any of the physics, and while it'll obviously have an impact on their degree and post degree employment, they are passing. 
I want to understand, but with constant assessments thrown our way, I don't feel like I can just sit down and understand the concepts in my own time. I'm constantly just chasing deadlines and attending lectures where often the lecturers don't even seem to care if we understand or not, they just give us a bunch of equations without explaining (or doing it half arsed) where it's all coming from.

Additionally, I have been suffering from depression for a number of years now, and staying focused and understanding quickly don't come easily to me, so I feel like I need extra resources, besides what the university offers. I don't have much time as exams are fast approaching and learning everything from the book by myself would take too long and not give me enough time to actually prepare for the exams.

How do I find the balance? Can you offer me some extra resources that could help me, or any advice?

I sincerely appreciate any input. I'm in tears nearly every day, confused and lost.

edit: I'm really thankful for every one's input. I do feel better about it all now, having heard other people's experiences. One of my problems is that I have a terrible memory and I am quite a bit slow to get things sometimes, but I feel like I can actually get this degree now.
