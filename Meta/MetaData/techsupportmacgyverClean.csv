1369798625.0	1f8wxi	Baked a motherboard for the first time today.	HiimCaysE	119	21	43	"I had a friend drop off a no-display HP Pavilion laptop last week and despite my best non-Mcguyver efforts, could not get it working.  So I read about baking the motherboard in an oven for ~10 minutes, which is supposed to reflow the solder to fix an issue where the GPU pins have stopped making contact.  I had heard about people doing this for years with Xboxes, but never tried it myself, and I had nothing to lose with this board at this point, so I went for it.

* Remove the MB from the case and remove as much as possible from the MB... RAM, CPU, cables, heatsinks, rubber mounts, etc.
* Wrap the MB in aluminum foil, cutting a hole above and below the GPU to expose it.
* Using 3 or 4 balls of aluminum foil as mounts, level the board on a baking pan, components (or most components) side up.
* Pop it into the oven and then bake it at 385degF.  It took about 6 minutes to preheat, and I left it in for an additional 6 minutes once it reached 385.  Open windows and use the stove fan in case there are any fumes.  There were hardly any on mine except the faint whiff of hot solder.
* Remove the MB from the oven, careful not to bang against anything (or risk a melty solder point dropping a component off of the underside of the MB). 
* Allow to cool for 15-30 minutes, reassemble, power on.

Despite all of the success stories and videos I researched beforehand, I was still amazed when the screen came on.  Success!"	t5_2up7a	True

and then? i can't believe it actually worked!

why no faith?  if you've ever recorded audio signal generated by headphones (using headphones as a mic), you know it doesn't usually come out too clear.  it usually sounds like tin can &amp; string audio quality.  we didn't have 1/4"" adapters to pipe one of the studio mics into the guitar tuner, so we put headphones on the guitar body and plugged that into the tuner input. simple, but so gratifyingly counter intuitive to manufacturer's intended use. and it worked well enough to finish the tracks without tuning regrets.  first-world anarchist's tech support macgyveration (to say it in subreddit piglipstick flavors)"	t5_2up7a	True

1367783606.0	1dqwp0	[Announcement] Introducing the Tech Support MacGyver Awards! We want input from the community!	Ihmhi	51	7	4	"A few days ago, a little idea popped into my head. We should give out awards for certain posts that meet certain criteria for funsies. So, I sat down with the other mods and hammered out some ideas.

Here's the result.

We are going to be introducing five new awards for Tech Support Macgyver posts. Winners will announced monthly and forever earn a place in the TSMG Hall of Fame. Winners will get special flair for their username, and every year we will figure out the best of the year's winners. There will probably be some sort of prizes for the yearly winners.

The awards are not mutually exclusive (you can win multiple awards with one post if we think you're the best fit for that award), although it's unlikely certain awards will mesh together.

You don't have to be the person who actually made or created the mod. We'd *love* to see TSMG subscribers posting stuff that *they* did, but that would involve a verification process and I'm not sure we need it. The awards will go to the person who made the post.

Having said all that, here's the categories:

&amp;nbsp;

**Best Junkyard Engineering:** Best post that works but doesn't look pretty. Securing hardware with duct tape &amp; wires, open cases, visible glue, bent &amp; cut metal. It doesn't have to look pretty - it just has to work.

**Best Unintended Use of a Product:** Using an object for something it was not intended for (such as using a rubber band as a fan belt, or using a CD-ROM as a gyroscope).

**Most Professionally Built:** A mod or repair that's so well done it could have come off of the shelf at a computer store.

**Most Spectacular Failure:** A project that didn't quite work as intended. In fact, it failed so badly that it started a small fire.

**Golden Paperclip Award:** The simplest, lowest-tech fix to a presented problem.

&amp;nbsp;

We will be taking commentary on this new system, the awards themselves, and anything related until **Wednesday, May 8th at 11:59PM EDT**. If you have questions, concerns, criticism, commentary, or ideas, post them here.

Thanks for your time."	t5_2up7a	True

I knew I had broken USB ports, but I didn't know that the contacts were bent and touching the walls of the ports. So I turned it off, took out the battery, took a paper clip, and bent it so I could enter the ports. I moved it wround so that I could make sure the contacts weren't touching anything. I then put some electrical tape over the ports (to assure it wouldn't happen again) and I turned it on. It worked. The end.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to introduce you to my homemade molly guard, which I had hand built. 

[This is my molly guard](http://imgur.com/8pWpLsQ).  A Sears shopper's card.

There's a reason it has this placed here.  My cats - Lina and Zelgadis - are rather intelligent.  This, as near as I can tell, started when they were kittens.

They know how to turn it off.  At least, Zelgadis does, and she has made efforts to do this in order to make me pay attention to her.

Now to explain these two cats, they are Bengal Cats.  This is a crossbreed of an Asian Leopard Cat and, frequently, either an Abyssinian or a Siamese.  (It's generally some sort of domestic cat that they are bred with.)  The genetic structure is not really relevant to this, but Wikipedia can tell you more.  They tend to come off as rather talkative, being involved with their humans, and particularly clever.  Zel, however, is an enigma - she is an odd, dark chocolate smoke color, which is pretty much one of a kind in Bengals, and is prone to playing ""I'll wander off somewhere, meow loudly, and you'll come and give me attention"", for lack of a better name of her game, in which she does exactly this.  For a while, we thought her brain was a bit stunted, but I think this proves otherwise.

Anyway. 

Once upon a time, about the time that they were four or five months old, Zel had discovered the power strip.  It was an older Belkin that my ex wife and I used.  So one fine day, I'm tooling around, and next thing I know, bamf, everything pops off with a click, and I hear a small, kitten-like ""meow"" from under my desk.  

I didn't think this was possible, so I turned everything back on, waited for fsck and chkdsk to do its thing (my ex was just about to migrate from OS/2 Warp at the time), and it was fine.  

Until she did it again.  I watched her stomp on that switch.  

That problem got solved fairly easily.  Duct tape and the plastic blister pack from a package of Rayovac batteries that my ex was using for her portable CD player.  Problem solved.

Well, since that time, I've been divorced, but that's another story.  I still have Lina and Zelgadis.

About two years ago, I upgraded my PC, which is contained in the In Win case you saw a small part of in the photo.   (The cylindrical object above the card that is attached through USB is one of my e-cigarette batteries.  I'm waiting for them to make one that also contains an 8 GB flash drive.  But that's another story.)  In particular, [this case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811108230) is what I own.  The old power strip had long since been replaced with a 350 vA UPS, which I later upgraded to a 1 KvA (when I learned the hard way that, in the event of power failure, you really want a UPS that's bigger than your PSU).   The power and reset buttons live on the top, beneath this card, which is taped onto the case with packing tape. 

She has yet to figure out that I only taped the top edge, so that I can get in underneath and use the power button when necessary without disassembling my work or using the PSU toggle.  Now, she just sits in my lap, while Lina curls up in the crook of my left arm.  I do not expect that she'll figure it out, because she's figured out that, if she sits in my lap, I'll give her attention.  

tl;dr: (in Prof. Farnsworth's voice) I've done it!  I have made something that is cat proof!

EDIT: These cats do exist.  Proof is found [here](http://imgur.com/a/UIMsV)."	t5_2up7a	True

1369524903.0	1f1z55	Help! The Internet is broken! - The tale of replacing capacitors on a Cisco router under the watchful eye of my Mom.	1000kai	31	4	10	"Basically I am tech support for my entire family. It is never a fun time...

So it is six at night, my mom is trolling facebook and watching TED talks on her laptop, I am reading a book. Suddenly this happens!

Mom: ""1000kai, help! The Internet is broken!""

So I go over like the great son I am and help my mom.

Me: Are you connected to our wireless network?

Her: No...

Me: Ok, so connect to it.

Her: It is GONE!

So I pull out my iPod and have a look. Yup, no Wi-Fi! At this point I realize it is not her laptop or her, something else is wrong. I tell her I will check it out and that the Internet is probably not gone.

I head over to the room where I have my computer and our modem and router. As I walk in I immediately know bad things have happened! The air smells kind of tangy/acidic and our nice Cisco E4200 has no lights on. I unplug it and our cable modem for half a minute and then plug them back in. The modem boots but our router looks like a roadkill kitten; sad and really dead.

Here is the deal, since I occasionally take the side-panel off of my desktop it is assumed I am the ub3r 1337 h4cx0r grandmaster of technology. If something breaks everyone thinks I broke it!

I have a spare router kicking around but it has no antennas. (I cut them off, don't ask why.) Basically, if I don't get this router fixed I will be paying for a new one! I pull out my screwdriver kit and get to work...

Upon seeing the routers motherboard I at first think I am screwed. One out of the seven caps on it has popped and begun to leak! crap Why me?

Then I start thinking. Out of my limited soldering experience I once replaced a capacitor on a old 478 board. It would be the same thing to replace a capacitor on our router, right? Well I went ahead and tried.

To the workshop! First, I plug in my soldering iron and let it start warming up. Second, I start madly searching through my box of old video cards and motherboards with the enthusiasm of a hyperactive kitten! Annnnnnnd... I find a match. It is identical in voltage and farad, the only difference is color. [1]

The de-soldering from the spare part and mounting of the capacitor goes of with out a hitch! I reassemble the E4200 and head back inside. [2]

The moment we have all been waiting for is here, will it work? I plug it in and... HOLY MOTHER MARY IT LIGHTS UP! I leave it to start for a moment and then yell to my mom to try using her laptop now. ""OK, it works. Thanks sweetie!""

TL;DR Our router breaks and then I live up to my title of ""ub3r 1337 h4cx0r grandmaster of technology"".

Things will keep running as they have so far, but I thought the rules on the side could be a little clearer for new people. If anything is unclear or you think things could be explained in a better way, please send us a modmail or post a comment here.

We've also added four more subreddits to our Promoted subreddits. Here's the breakdown of what and why.

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/techsupport, /r/talesfromtechsupport, /r/techsupportgore** - If you're not up on your TSMG history, this whole community was started by a [silly little post](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportgore/comments/xs12e/cousin_used_a_golf_tee_and_super_glue_to_fix_his/c5p6slh) made in /r/techsupportgore. /u/Ugbrog made the comment, /u/Stewartspicer created the subreddit, and I (/u/Ihmhi) made the first post. (/u/Rapptz and /u/appropriate-username jumped on the team quickly enough and have been super cool folks!)

In that sense, our heritage can be traced back to /r/techsupportgore whose history is intermixed with /r/techsupport and /r/talesfromtechsupport. We're all one big family!

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/DIY** is similar in spirit to a lot of the things we do here. Why hire somebody else when you can do it yourself?

&amp;nbsp;

**/r/gamephysics** was here for a while as a promoted subreddit. The bureacrat in me says it was probably there for a good reason so I'm leaving it there.

&amp;nbsp;

Lastly, we've added our [Subreddit of the Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/143spm/december_1_2012_rtechsupportmacgyver_with_a/) post and [the post that started it all](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportgore/comments/xs12e/cousin_used_a_golf_tee_and_super_glue_to_fix_his/c5p6slh) to the side as a badge of honor and for funsies, respectively.

Again, if you have any questions or comments on the matter, please send us a modmail or post a comment here.

Lastly, I wanted to say it's been a positive delight seeing this community grow over the last 8 months or so. We've had very little in the way of problems with our userbase and we've had a constant flow of new and interesting content.

My company does computer refreshes for schools every summer, every 5 years they get new imacs and macbooks. This is my first summer here. The plan my boss; we'll call her Deb, deviously came up with is to wipe the old imacs that came in as they swapped them for new ones. pitch them to other schools and have us image them for more profit. 

It was about 2 months when she asked all the techies under my manager Bob, about a way to do this. 3 weeks go by and nobody really steps forward.  Naturally I suggest dban, but then I was given the number of iMacs. Not a valid option in terms of time.

I take a look at the company's imaging solution right now. Which is Clonezilla, or CloneyZ as I like to call it. During that 3 week period Deb, had ordered a couple of raspberry Pis and asked me to compile a base build for them and copy it across SD cards so they could be demo tested for schools looking into a lowcost alternative for PC classes.

So after a few minutes I had a script to get all the baseline software installed etc. It did it all automatically with a hue of green front on a black terminal. I felt proud.

So while I'm doing all the prep work with the RPis; Bob asks if I had given any thought to the imac debacle. We can't have 1500 imacs with school data still on them sitting in our warehouse.

I then get the idea of using our own imaging software CloneyZ to somehow brick them. I knew it was far fetched but I decided to give it a try. Only issue is imacs don't have a PXE boot function (Typical apple), which means they couldn't connect to our CloneyZ servers. Ruled that option out.

So I let it sit percalating for a couple of week while I went about my usual other tasks. They send me out to client sites for site support from 8:30 to 1pm every day. The afternoon I'm at the office working on various projects, including syncing our imaging servers so that the images are all the same. (We do lots of imaging)


I then had a revelation as if it just came to me. Grab an image of a Raspi OS, which is ARM based, and push it using a CloneyZ USB boot disk.

My first initial test proved well. However I tested it on my laptop in which I was building the solution. So all my notes and files I had saved were essentially lost within the 3 minutes it took me to push a 2GB image to my own machine. 


Oh well no biggie just some scripts I can rewrite later, plus a few downloads. We mainly use Google Drive for backing up the important stuff. 

Fast forward 2 more weeks. Its time to present my findings. At this point it was a very sloppy design requiring 2 flash drives just to kill an imac. Bob said do better.

Eventually I got it slimmed up to one. And even wrote a fancy one liner script to be saved on the flash drive. That will auto accept any y/n messages, and reboot the machine afterwards without any user intervention. Which is good because the girl they hired to do this has no idea about technical jargon.

As I type this, hundreds of imacs are getting wiped with an ARM based image which will fubar the OSx partition and any windows partitions on it in the process.


I feel like an evil genius.


TL;DR Guns aren't evil, But Flash Drives twisting the general use of software are.

Edit: Okay look at Rule #2 of this sub, I know there are other tools out there, but we were limited in our resources as a small company and can't just go buy X software to do Y task.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Best Junkyard Engineering**

*Best post that works but doesn't look pretty. Securing hardware with duct tape &amp; wires, open cases, visible glue, bent &amp; cut metal. It doesn't have to look pretty - it just has to work. Success is optional - it's about the appearance and the attempt more so than it actually working.*

And the winner is...

[I fixed the scale at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/1f044l/i_fixed_the_scale_at_work/)

by /u/meepsi!

&amp;nbsp;

**Best Unintended Use of a Product**

*Using an object for something it was not intended for (such as using a rubber band as a fan belt, or using a CD-ROM as a gyroscope). Need to open a beer? Why not grab a handy stick of RAM! Got to hold a hard drive up? A screwdriver jammed into a server is probably secure!*

And the winner is...

[I also never flash xbox drives with recommended hardware - you can't buy a PMT probe that's this awesome](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/1edaxh/i_also_never_flash_xbox_drives_with_recommended/)

by /u/Zamda!

&amp;nbsp;

**Most Professionally Built**

*A mod or repair that's so well done it could have come off of the shelf at a computer store. Alienware could sell your computer at an insane markup to readers of PC Magazine.*

And the winner is...

[Friend of mine custom built an arcade stick using a normal controller some wires and scrap wood.](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/1dm1p8/friend_of_mine_custom_built_an_arcade_stick_using/)

by /u/MIK136PARKS!

&amp;nbsp;

**Most Spectacular Failure**

*A project that didn't quite work as intended. In fact, it failed so badly that it started a small fire and may have caused minor maiming or a little blood loss. (TSMG kindly asks that you follow all safety precautions, and furthermore asks that you submit a picture when things go horribly, horribly wrong anyway.)*

And the winner is...

Nothing!

by Nobody! ... :(

&amp;nbsp;

**Golden Paperclip Award**

*The simplest, lowest-tech fix to a presented problem. Hey you know what can keep a hard drive in place? Cardboard! Need to keep a door open? May as well make that decade-old hard drive useful!*

And the winner is...

[""E"" and ""D"" laptop keys were hard to press. Fixed them with tiny paper balls.](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/comments/1en3kb/e_and_d_laptop_keys_were_hard_to_press_fixed_them/)

All of the winners have been notified by private message. The posts have had their flair assigned and the users have had their flair assigned.

A quick aside to the winners and all posters - everyone who has submitted should have their paperclip flair. Reddit seems to be derpy with actually *applying* the flair - for instance, one or two of the winners have the proper star flair applied on the mod side but it isn't yet showing up when viewing them in the subreddit.

If you have any flair problems (or really any other problems, or questions, or you just want to tell Stewart that he has pretty eyes), go ahead and use that ""message the moderators"" button - or just message us directly. ^We're ^so ^lonely...

I also want to say on the topic of Most Spectacular Failure, this is a missed opportunity for whoever has been sitting on a picture of a burning, jury-rigged garage door opener. One good post that fit the criteria of ""a disaster as a result of Macgyvering"" could have won the category by default!

If you've got pictures of any of your [shenanigans](http://i.imgur.com/tgPYAdj.gif) gone wrong, put 'em up folks! In the meantime, I'll see if I can find a way to encourage this type of post.

I'll get the Wiki properly updated with the winners soon. I haven't had the opportunity to pretty it up like I'd like to just yet. I promise it won't take like, a ""Valve time"" timetable to get it done.

Congratulations to the winners! Thanks to all the subscribers who have submitted great content, thanks to all the subscribers who have commented, and thanks to all the subscribers for, well, subscribing. Last (but not least), thanks to my fellow mods for voting and really getting into the whole process. I'm really looking forward to doing this again next month!

I went to an electronics faire today. Among fucktons upon fucktons of cheapo Chinese crud there were a couple of stands selling interesting things, among which old computer hardware. And one such stand had [**two 1U**](http://i.imgur.com/RHBQWdh.jpg) and [**one 2U**](http://i.imgur.com/xIMjstL.jpg) servers for ridiculously cheap prices. The €60 1U in that pic was ramless (a problem as they all need ECC RAM), but the others were ready to run but for the addition of a hard disk. The specs for the CPUs weren't listed, but they couldn't be too old because the HD caddies were all SATA.

Though I have absolutely no use whatsoever for servers, I've always liked rackmount gear for some reason, so I'm wondering: how would a Xeon in its natural habitat perform for non-gaming tasks (Internet, lightweight media including flash video, this sort of stuff) compared to non-server hardware of its time period? I'm perfectly aware it'd be wasted, but I still fancy a nice slab of a rackmount machine on my desk. :D"	t5_2up7a	True

First off, I got the mods’ approval before posting this, so I’m not spamming the subreddit or anything. 

Anyways, I’m a professor at the University of North Texas working on a grant that funds research on online help forums. I’m hoping to find people who participate in these forums (including, though not limited to, this subreddit) who are willing to do a phone interview with me. I’m particularly interested in why people got started in these forums, why they participate, and how they view the community. I’m looking for diverse perspectives, so even if you’re not a frequent participant, I could still learn a ton from talking to you. The interviews should take between 30-60 minutes, and I’m totally flexible as to time. 

If you’d like to help me out with my research, either shoot me an email at Jordan.frith (at) unt.edu, pm me, or comment on this thread and I’ll message you. I really appreciate it!

Let's get started with the tour.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###New Design

&amp;nbsp;

**Header**

A brand new header has been made from a composite of some of the latest and most aesthetically pleasing and/or horrifying TSMG posts. Liked the old header? [Here's an Imgur link for posterity.](http://imgur.com/aQU9byC)

I took special care to include a big honking red fan right at the top left because I know how much /u/Stewartspicer loves fan posts.

If you are on a horizontal resolution of less than 1920 pixels, you can click [this link](http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/4wLmggwJXJBWq9Xr.png) to see the header in full.

&amp;nbsp;

**Sidebar**

Further enhancing the TSMG experience is a pretty header image. TSMG 2.0 means *twice* the Macgyver! Bonus internet points to whomever can identify what sort of computer Macgyver is using and what episode this particular picture is from.

&amp;nbsp;

**Mail Icon**

The drab, unimaginative envelope has been summarily burned and discarded. In its place stands the holy symbol of Macgyverers everywhere, the paperclip. Behold it in all of its redorange glory whenever you have new mail!

&amp;nbsp;

**Link Flair**

Winning posts of the monthly TSMG Awards will be distinguished with special link flair. This will make the links stand out a bit more!

The awards will be explained in more detail further down the post; for now, here's the flair for your viewing pleasure:

* [Best Junkyard Engineering](http://i.imgur.com/TOmQ15j.png)
* [Best Unintended Use of a Product](http://i.imgur.com/FA2TJoS.png)
* [Most Professionally Built](http://i.imgur.com/AC3kyFU.png)
* [Most Spectacular Failure](http://i.imgur.com/mCrqFDx.png)
* [Golden Paperclip Award](http://i.imgur.com/WeIWNlM.png)

&amp;nbsp;

**User Flair**

We wouldn't be much of a subreddit without our (at the time of this writing) 13,745 subscribers, and we wouldn't have anything to *show* those subscribers if it weren't for our submitters.

As thanks to those of you who submit content to TSMG, all submitters will be granted the following nifty paperclip flair:

* [Nifty Paperclip User Flair](http://i.imgur.com/05TJqD0.png)

Furthermore, we will be tying this in with our awards system.

Before I go into detail about how it *will* work, I will tell you how I *wanted* it to work.

I *wanted* to be able to just add multiple user flairs to people as well as duplicates of those flairs. So, someone who had won two Golden Paperclip Awards, a Most Spectacular Failure Award, and Most Professionally Built Award would have those images next to their name. Hovering over those images would show you the month and year the award was won, and clicking on that particular piece of flair would take you to that post.

Unfortunately, absolutely none of this is possible with the way Reddit implements flair.

^Also ^I ^hate ^link ^flair.

I personally spend something on the order of 36-40 hours trying to figure out how to get it to work. I went through dozens of /r/csshelp posts. I talked with people. I uploaded a picture of a paperclip and rubbed it against the stylesheet.css for good luck. Unfortunately, it was all to no avail.

The solution is this: we're going to go with a simple ""Star"" system. Here's some examples:

* [1 Award Received](http://i.imgur.com/UFQMtpS.png)

* [6 Awards Received](http://i.imgur.com/dtDzhP9.png)

* [10 Awards Received](http://i.imgur.com/D6Vwvsl.png)

Now, the prospect of someone receiving 10 TSMG Awards in a short timeframe is extremely unlikely unless Richard Dean Anderson himself starts posting here. In the event someone *does* surpass 10 awards, we'll be sure to accommodate them in a quick timeframe.

We'll be using the (currently bare-bones) [Tech Support Macgyver Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupportmacgyver/wiki/index) to show who has won which awards each month. We'll make sure it's set up in all kinds of nice ways so you can see all the winners of a particular award or all of the awards a particular user has won. This will take some time to set up properly and may not be implemented by the end of this month.

&amp;nbsp;

**Fancy-pants Subreddit Name**

The subreddit name is now displayed in a prettier and much more fancy-pantsier style.

&amp;nbsp;

**Same Ol' Ugly Reddit Logo**

This will likely change in the future. After kicking butt on the header, I honestly couldn't think of something that would mesh well with it. Got an idea for a the Reddit Logo? Go ahead and cook one up and send me a private message - if I and the other mods like it, we'll probably use it! Bonus, you'll get a nifty little credit on the sidebar for being so super awesome.

^^Seriously ^^I ^^hate ^^link ^^flair ^^40 ^^hours ^^of ^^on ^^and ^^off ^^coding ^^down ^^the ^^drain...

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###The Tech Support Macgyver Awards

&amp;nbsp;

We're officially announcing the launch of The Tech Support Macgyver Awards. Every month, one post may be chosen to win these awards for internet fame and glory! Let's start with what the awards are:

&amp;nbsp;

[**Best Junkyard Engineering**](http://i.imgur.com/TOmQ15j.png)

Best post that works but doesn't look pretty. Securing hardware with duct tape &amp; wires, open cases, visible glue, bent &amp; cut metal. It doesn't have to look pretty - it just has to work. Success is optional - it's about the appearance and the attempt more so than it actually working.

&amp;nbsp;

[**Best Unintended Use of a Product**](http://i.imgur.com/FA2TJoS.png)

Using an object for something it was not intended for (such as using a rubber band as a fan belt, or using a CD-ROM as a gyroscope). Need to open a beer? Why not grab a handy stick of RAM! Got to hold a hard drive up? A screwdriver jammed into a server is probably secure!

&amp;nbsp;

[**Most Professionally Built**](http://i.imgur.com/AC3kyFU.png)

A mod or repair that's so well done it could have come off of the shelf at a computer store. Alienware could sell your computer at an insane markup to readers of PC Magazine.

&amp;nbsp;

[**Most Spectacular Failure**](http://i.imgur.com/mCrqFDx.png)

A project that didn't quite work as intended. In fact, it failed so badly that it started a small fire and may have caused minor maiming or a little blood loss. (TSMG kindly asks that you follow all safety precautions, and furthermore asks that you submit a picture when things go horribly, horribly wrong anyway.)

&amp;nbsp;

[**Golden Paperclip Award**](http://i.imgur.com/WeIWNlM.png)

The simplest, lowest-tech fix to a presented problem. Hey you know what can keep a hard drive in place? Cardboard! Need to keep a door open? May as well make that decade-old hard drive useful!

&amp;nbsp;

There they are. Now onto the awards process.

First and foremost, **a particular award may not be given out every month.** We'll try our hardest to find the best fit for each category, but we are certainly not going to shoehorn a post in because we can't find anything better for an award.

Secondly, another important thing: all mods of TSMG are ineligible to receive any awards, even if they lose or reliinquish their moderator status at a later date. Future mods will keep any past awards they've won, but they will be ineligible for any and all future awards. Any TSMG mods who have submitted a post will, however, get that neato little paperclip next to their names. We simply cannot involve the chance of mods winning awards due to obvious bias and conflict of interest, so it will never happen.

We are not going to require any sort of verification to prove that it was indeed you that did the Macgyvering. This would create an incredibly difficult burden on our moderators - I wouldn't advocate for something like this if we had ten times the mods we do now. It's ultimately all about bringing Macgyver-y content to TSMG - so really, the awards are going to the submitter for showing us the best examples for those particular categories.

All awards selection and the selection process will be held behind the curtains. It'd be nice to do some sort of community voting, but it is pretty much impossible to keep it to one vote per person.

**May 2013 will be the first month within which the TSMG awards are open. All submissions made during the month of May are eligible.**

Here is a simplified explanation of the process:

At the first of the month, moderators will submit their considerations for whatever awards they like. Any mod can submit any qualifying post they like for any category. We then have a vote process to iron things out whereby the nominated post is backed by a majority of the mods.

If a nominated post passes the private voting, that post wins the award for the month. If a nominated post is tied, stalemated, or completely unable to attain mod support, then that post won't win. If there's no winning nominations for a category, the award simply will not be given out for that month.

**There will be no ties, period.**

Nominations, the voting process, and all of this other backroom skullduggery will be kept confidential - the only public knowledge will be who won which awards.

Voting for a month in particular (in this case, May) will take place during the first five days or so in the following month (in this case, June 1-5th). The 5th of the following month is sort of a soft deadline - we will not strictly bind ourselves to this deadline but we are going to try to hold ourselves to it. Us five moderators are a volunteer force, and TSMG is definitely not everything in our lives.

At the beginning of the following year, all of the previous year's winners will be entered into a vote for the best in their category of the year. There may be prizes, but no promises!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###In Conclusion...

&amp;nbsp;

...I want to give big shout-outs to the other moderators for their help with this update. Shout outs as well to /u/FluffRule and /u/gavin19 for their phenomenal help with the CSS, especially the bit about link flair because it was *driving me insane*.

My question: Can this monitor somehow be (safely, ish) hooked up to the 650w power supply currently in the computer, to avoid having to use a second plug?

1376339617.0	1k8ald	Announcement: TSMG is looking for moderators (and some other things, too!)	Ihmhi	8	3	5	"[Mod Pants on!](http://i.imgur.com/j3jYWZq.gif)

&amp;nbsp;

Tech Support Macgyver has had a rough few weeks lately. One of our mods resigned due to other commitments, a couple of us have been very busy (or had other ""life"" stuff in general going on), and Stewartspicer has effectively put me in charge.

This all happened roughly via the TSMG Awards for June 2013. We didn't forget - it just took an exceedingly long time to hear back from them at all. (The TSMG awards are not cancelled - they are merely delayed.)

The short, simple truth is that we're going to need some new moderators. As such, I've created an application via Google Forms [which you can see here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O6J2NaAGPOdUpi8x2Y52AHmKn_258wmtfFOtlyQ5WpM/viewform)

It is in no way comprehensive and is often silly or outright strange in places. It will take between 5 and 20 minutes to complete depending on how many of the numerous optional questions you answer and to what degree you answer them.

So go ahead and apply. I might take on 2 mods, I might take on 10. Who knows? It'll all be up to how many applications we get and what sort of answers we're looking at.

Oh, and while a lot of the questions are opinion-related, a handful of them have correct answers. Please don't go sharing these as they would sort of defeat the purpose of the exercise.

Moderator applications will be open for a little over 72 hours - the deadline is Thursday, August 15th at 5:00 PM EST. Any applications received ~~before~~ after that will be considered invalid.

&amp;nbsp;

We've also started working on integrating Automoderator functionality into TSMG. There's been a hiccup or two so far but for the most part it's been running smoothly.

I'm working on learning how best to use it and it will take time. For now, Automoderator will let us know when a post or comment gets multiple reports. If you see something that violates the [Rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) or the sidebar rules, go ahead and hit the report link. Feel free to also throw a modmail our way, too - just be sure to include a link to the reported post so we know what the hell you're talking about.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the TSMG Awards, well... like most things, I tend to prefer to do things right rather than do a shitty job quickly. I'm still waiting on hearing from one person and I'd prefer to get his input for the month of June. We'll handle July after that and we'll keep going as per usual.

&amp;nbsp;

That's it for me for now. I tried to keep this short, sweet, and as coherent as I possibly could in my current extremely-tired state. I'm looking forward to hearing from the community!

I'd been content to simply hack together something to make use of the 1440p panel that I know is good, but since completely disassembling it I've been wondering about possibly Macgyvering an ATX psu to it.  


The main wiring harness connects to the mainboard with a 14-pin molex.  A standard 20-pin from an ATX psu also happens to fit it.  Unfortunately, though, I've been unable to find any information about the pinouts for this logic board.  Assuming the logic board is still functional, I' rather not blow it up just to roll the dice, not to mention I'm 99% certain it's not going to be a direct fit anyways.  

Anyone have some insight? I know modding the old G5 imacs with an ATX is pretty well documented.

I've decided to extend the deadline for moderator applications to **12:01 AM Eastern on Monday, August 19th, 2013.** This pretty much gives you all the way up until Sunday to post. If you're terrible at calculating this sort of thing, [here's a link](http://www.timeanddate.com/library/abbreviations/timezones/na/edt.html) ([Alternative #1](http://www.thetimenow.com/edt/eastern_daylight_time), [Alternative #2](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/eastern-time/)) that shows you what time it is on the East Coast currently.

We've gotten a fair few results already - enough that I could comfortably expand the mod pool by a couple of guys at least - but I'd like to cast a wider net. We seem to get in a handful of responses all at roughly the same time every day, so I imagine that it's people coming home from work or killing time at the end of the work day.

Now you guys and gals will have pretty much straight through until the weekend in case you've been too busy otherwise. I want to get some new mods on board ASAP, but I also don't want to be so quick about it that a lot of people don't get the chance to apply.

**This is the only time the deadline will be extended.** I've certainly got enough people now to pick up at least two new mods, I'd just like *more* if possible. Can't hurt to see who's interested!

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1O6J2NaAGPOdUpi8x2Y52AHmKn_258wmtfFOtlyQ5WpM/viewform) the application link if you haven't applied yet. It will take between 5 and 20 minutes and is in no way comprehensive or 100% serious."	t5_2up7a	True

We have a stereo system set up with a bluetooth receiver connecting to an ipod touch that we carry in an arm band.

We quickly learned that moving around the gym with the ipod causes gaps in the streaming, so it is now velcroed to the wall. The receiver is up on a shelf about ten feet off the ground so the kids can't reach it. 

I was hoping someone in this community might help me work a solution to make the connection more stable. What would be the max distance that a bluetooth connection *should* hold? Is the fact that we're jumping/gymnasticizing around the cause? Would I be able to make some sort of makeshift reflector to add to signal stability? Do we maybe just have a crappy bluetooth receiver?

Thanks in advance for any advice, as well as for the constant inspiration from this subreddit on how to fix things in a pinch.
