1371680125.0	1gopst	How I (and you) can turk full-time all day and a general thank you to this subreddit.	sulfurboy	205	42	59	"First off, I want to start off by pointing out how badass this subreddit is. Why? Over the past couple of days I've posted a few one or two penny hits that were super simple. I posted the direct link and adfly link on a sort of honor system for lack of a better word, because I felt like making someone wait 5 seconds to do a 3 second hit was dumb. To my sort of surprise a ton of people (my rough estimate is about 1 in 3) still used the adfly link. 

As a thank you and since a quite a few people have asked I'm going to give a general rundown of how I do a full day of turking. On an average day I can make about $40-50 in about 6 hours of half ass working. By half ass I mean, I smoke a cig once an hour, watch tv, etc. I'm posting this here instead of the mturk subreddit because, well that subreddit hardly gets used, and I'd be afraid that if I posted it there a lot of people who ask me here would miss this. OK. Now to my general schedule:

I typically log-on around 8am. The mornings are best for surveys. My theory being that people work on them overnight, go to the office (or classroom) in the morning, get them approved and then post them. 

So 8am-930am do surveys, pay is $7-12 an hour.

After that I check a set of favorite batch hits that get randomly posted throughout the day. A lot of these get scooped up really quick, so I'll keep the search box for them open in seperate tabs and refresh every 30 mins or so throughout the day to see if any are posted. I'm going to be a little selfish and not give all of them away, but a couple of my favorites to do right now are the ""wmt admin"" translation ranking hits and the crowdsource research product question hits. I can make $10 an hour doing these but I have to constantly be on the look out for them. 

After that I check for search engine ranking hits. Search for either ""search engine rankings"" or by name (Edwin Massey, Ormiston, Myles Anderson, etc.) These will get posted every couple of days in batches. As a general rule I only do the ones that pay at least 4 cents a keyword search. Majority of them pay more than that. I make about $8-10 an hour doing these and takes up about 30 mins a day. 

After that, check for more surveys, check my favorite batch hits. Rinse. Repeat.

If after that I can't find anything else to do, I'm start browsing for new batch hits to do that are good. This is hit or miss, sometimes I'll find nothing and sometimes I'll find something amazing and work on it for hours. My favorite example of these is the netmsi porn title hits. If you ever see them, do them as much and as long as possible. You can make upwards of $15 to $20 an hour if you're creative. Pay and time put into this obviously varies. All the while, I'm refreshing my favorite batch hits every 20-30 mins.

From there, if I really want to grind out some cash, crowdsource or crowdflower will usually have something you can do that pays $5-7 an hour doing it, but I usually just go play some civ5 or watch TV unless I'm super broke. 


General quick hit pro-tips:

1) If you want to do transcript work, crowdsurf is best in my opinion. The controls are easy, the audio is usually really good, the rating system is forgiving and the pay is above average. The only downside is they don't always have hits up.

2) Take turkopticon ratings with a grain of salt and give 'bad' requestors that pay good a chance. TO is an amazing service, but like any other complaint site, people are almost always more likely to post to it after a bad experience then they are a good one, making the reviews inflated towards the negative side. Had I taken all TO reviews seriously, I'd have missed out on some great hits. A recent example, is the 'wmt admin' hits. I can grind these at a rate of about $10 an hour, the requestor has bad reviews, but I've done about 200 without a single rejection and all have been paid within 48 hours. 

3) Unless you're really desperate, don't do hits that pay you less than ten cents a minute. If people stop doing these crap low paying hits then requestors will be forced to pay more.

4) Say thank you to people who post on this subreddit at least twice as much as you complain. Adfly pays probably a lot less than you think. I make (very rough average) about 8 cents per hit I post. 

5) Life's too short to drink bad beer. 

Feel free to ask any questions. I'm by no means a top turker or anything, but I hope this helps some of the newer people, or the part time turkers looking to make more money. Below is an adfly link that leads to some mitch hedberg stand up if you'd like to say thank you for this post. Watching the video is optional, but highly encouraged.

1340394575.0	vg890	Discussion- All new HITSWorthTurkingFor members, please read!	ditsie7	181	26	68	"First of all, I want to welcome you to this subreddit and the mTurk community. This subreddit has made the process of being a Turkey much more profitable for me and your help will be appreciated! And each time I or my boyfriend (because we both use my reddit account for doing this) see a lucrative HIT, we are sure to post it. mTurk can be an amazing source of extra revenue, between his and my work this month alone, we've together made close to $600. I want to see everyone be able to do that! But over the last few days, the insurgence of newcomers has made HITSWorthTurkingFor much more of a ~~clusterfuck~~  headache and I have a few polite suggestions so that we can make this community more efficient for everyone: 

*1. MAKE SURE THAT THE HIT YOU ARE POSTING IS NOT ALREADY POSTED: seriously. like most other subreddits, re-posts are bad (mmkay) and all they do is clog up the feed. If you have a great HIT you want to share, please make sure that it is not already posted. I have seen a MULTITUDE of HITs that have been posted 5+ times, and it makes it much harder to sort through and distinguish what you have/have not done. 

*2. DON'T POST EVERY SINGLE HIT YOU FIND: it's called HITs... WORTH... TurkingFor, for a very good reason. If you find a $.50+ survey or something that takes less than 5 or so minutes, please please please post it. But if it's a CrowdFlower sentiment analysis or Google search engine HIT, these are something many of us do not consider worthwhile and so please refrain from posting them! Thank you so much. 

*3. PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH mTURK and THIS SITE BEFORE MAKING POSTS: Most of the questions newcomers have are very explicitly answered in the FAQ sheet or on Turk itself. Definitions of TO's, AC's and other mTurk jargon is all on the FAQ sheet, please refer to it or prior posts if you are unclear. 

I am not trying to be rude or sound like a snatch for posting this, but I find it necessary to make some sort of suggestion because I want this site to be as efficient and helpful to everyone as it has been for me. Thank you all for reading, have a wonderful weekend!

Slurmsoda	203	55	55	"I'm speaking in response to this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/150rmu/us_complete_a_10_minute_survey_christian/c7i7uzh) Before he edited it, he said, ""Do the hard word search, its easy. Also I'm from the church of the flying spaghetti monster teehee.""

Why do that? I know I'm speaking to the choir here, but I could not believe I was reading something so juvenile like that.

I believe EricHerboso replied to that person and explained well why one should not do that and even the requester(vonhippellab) for the same hit being talked about came in to chime in

Ethics aside, by doing this, you are contributing to help requesters not want to post more hits and decreasing the supply of well paying hits by great requesters.

I dunno, if I had the ability, I would ban [Sometimes_Steve](http://www.reddit.com/user/Sometimes_Steve) and anyone else that does this type of stuff. To me, doing that type of thing is unacceptable. We already know of a few requesters who visit this subreddit, it would at least show we are doing something about this problem and show them we have their backs. I know banning doesn't really stop the scum, they'll just make another account, but at least it shows something is being done about it.

***TEMPLATE FOR EMAIL TO AMAZON***:

Hi
A whole bunch of my fellow turkers and I were massively rejected by requester 33cube. MASSIVE rejections for supposed ""poor quality"" work that all got rejected in a single minute. That seems virtually IMPOSSIBLE that someone can review 54 submissions or more within a single minute and reject them ALL at once. This is a scam, plain and simple.
He's now put up thousands more to scam us all out of even more money. Is there going to be something done about this? I don't care about losing the money, that comes with a rejection. I DO, HOWEVER, care about my numbers, which decide what jobs I will be able to do on this website. I use mturk to pay for medications, bills, and rent.
This would not be such an issue to me if it were only me. Sure, it'd be unfair to me but this is happening to many of your workers. So many of them.
What are you planning on doing about this? Can workers depend on you to have their backs? Or are we all on our own?
Please email me ASAP.

1359730504.0	17p27q	Announcement - This is not the greatest turker forum in the world, no. This is just a tribute.	wildncrazyguy	122	16	40	"This is something near and dear to us mods. In fact, we've been talking about this day for months. Take a second to realize just how far we've come.

One year ago, we came to the conclusion that turkers needed a better forum for finding the best paying HITs on mturk. A lot of people, myself included at one time, thought mturk was not worth the time it took to find a good paying HIT. Even with some of the great tools of the day - like TurkOpticon, and the forums that served as a meeting place for turkers and requesters alike, it was still very difficult for the typical user to make a decent wage from mturk.

And so, one year ago, we started this subreddit with the mission of having a forum where users would be encouraged to post HITs for each other. HITs could be voted upon so that the best would rise to the top. We could all benefit and increase our wages together.

While we have experienced growing pains, expanding beyond my greatest expectations - to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 17,000 posts in *one year*, I sincerely believe the turking environment is better for the worker than it has ever been and will only continue to improve.

----

We know our origins. We know who makes this forum thrive and we couldn't have done it without you. So as a thank you, we will be posting a few freebie HITs throughout the day, with a few random extra bonuses thrown in.

So here is the first one - a set of 100 HITs for 5 cents a piece. The password is ""If a ball and bat cost $1.10 cents together. and bat is $1 more than the ball. how much does the ball cost?""

We'll accept either the statement in the quotes or the actual answer (if you do the latter, just make sure you get the answer right **HINT: it's not $0.10**).

I'm honestly not sure why the downvote arrows were removed as I was not active here at the time, but it seems like the sub is a safe haven for certain people posting just to get adfly revenue.

The worst part is that these people get upvotes from others who do not mind doing a 30 minute HIT for $1.00.  Why does this seem like a safe haven for people posting HNWTF?  I get if people want to support those who post any HITs, but why are those who want to maintain an average of $.10/minute being discouraged to speak out (in the sense that downvoting is seemingly discouraged).

The survey quality that has been posted as of late seems to have steeply declined and I wanted to address the issue.

* We seek to post hits that are WELL PAYING for short periods of time. 

* As a rule, this has been established as something that takes about $.10/minute. 

* I know it has been slow lately, but that is no reason to post poor surveys, just don't post them at all.

* Posting bad/mediocre surveys pushes surveys worth doing off of the page

* If your survey pays $.05/minute this is not a ""Hit Worth Turking For"" and many members will downvote your post to show this.

* Anything under $.10 is generally not worth posting with some exceptions (possible bonuses etc.)

* Most essays (with some exceptions) are not worth posting as these are a dime a dozen.

EDIT: Posting surveys that will likely pay is important too so make sure the requestor has a decent TO (turkopticon rating) Download the add-on [here](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/)  Thanks FrankPapageorgio

What are some specific examples of HITs that violate Amazon Mechanical Turk policies?

- HITs requiring disclosure of the Worker's identity or e-mail address, either directly or indirectly

- **HITs requiring registration at another website or group**

- HITs that directly or indirectly promote a site, service, or opinion

- **HITs that violate the terms and conditions of an activity or website (for instance asking Workers to vote for something)**

- HITs that have explicit or offensive content, for instance, nudity, but do not have the Adult Content Qualification

- HITs asking Workers to solicit third parties

- **HITs that generate ""referred"" site visits or click-through traffic**

- **HITs that ask Workers to take action to manipulate a website's behavior or results**

- HITs that violate intellectual property rights of any party

- HITs that require Workers to download software

**Note** a requester can *ask* for an email address if it's totally *voluntary* and used to give you something (like a psych study asking you if you want to hear about the results of the study).

Honz0	87	11	37	"**Update** Currently the main extension works, from scanning your initial database, to adding HITs to the database after completion and displaying which ones you have completed in the main HIT list as well as the individual HIT.    
  
I am in the process of finishing up an extension that will automatically check whether or not you have done the HIT you are looking at!  

I joined mTurking exactly 1 week ago and I've seen numerous threads, and comments on here and on other forums about fellow turkers wanting a way to easily check whether they have done an HIT. So I've decided to create it.  

**Some Features:**    

* On the main HIT list, it will display whether you have done it or not, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/GXJ5w.png)
* On the individual HIT, it will show a nice popup box, [like so](http://i.imgur.com/AruSq.png)
* Automatically scans all of your worker history pages to build your local HIT database, and then remembers each HIT after you have completed them.
* On the History page it will display the remaining time of your Auto-Approval left if it has not been approved.
* ???, please throw out any ideas you think would assist you while turking!

What I am trying to do with this extension: Provide assistance for mTurk user's that don't violate any rules of Amazon in the fastest, most efficient manner without: slowing down Turking, utilizing valuable space that could throw off users, and make a polished extension.  

Some questions for you guys so far:  

* [In this picture](http://i.imgur.com/GXJ5w.png), how is the awareness that you completed it? Should I add anything else / change anything?
* [In this picture](http://i.imgur.com/AruSq.png), is that box a nuisance? Should I change it some way?

1342024146.0	we395	Announcement - Adfocus has stated they won't pay this month	ofnoaccount	78	12	113	"For those who aren't already aware, the person behind Adfocus created a [new reddit account](http://www.reddit.com/user/AdFocus) to respond to criticisms in [this discussion post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/) It's understandable for him to decide that the links posted here were not generating enough traffic conversions to be financially worthwhile. 

*It's much less easy to sympathize with his decision to [withhold everyone's earnings](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5ceilu) immediately before a scheduled payout.* 

[He has stated that he was previously aware of the subreddit's model,](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5cdap1) but choose to ""let it slide"" up till this month. One can follow most of his rationale that the reward pool constitutes violation of the Terms of Service (TOS) in regards to the community account. However, the selective enforcement of those terms after we began generating larger incomes appears incredibly self serving. 

His explanation is that he runs Adfocus entirely by himself and therefore wasn't able to entirely investigate the nuances of the subreddit. I find it hard to empathize with a desicion not to hire adequate staff to run your business in order to maximize your own income and then only put effort into auditing accounts the same day more substantial payments are due to be made.

Further, while the HWTF account might plausibly be construed as in violation of the condition on incentivising the clicking of links, to claim everyone else's account to also be in violation is much more of a stretch. Accounts have even been banned that did not sign up under the referral link and ones that primarily posted outside this subreddit. He has recognized the lack of clear rule in the TOS and as such has [hastily added a new one](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5cejpy) to specifically cover this sub.

While he claims that paying this community for their links posted in June threatens his ability [to stay in business](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5cepz6), I estimate that the members if this sub earned ~$1000 in June. Posts on the ""proof of payment"" section of [the Adfocus forum](http://adfocus.proboards.com/index.cgi) show that the payouts for those using this subreddit are relatively insignificant. He states there that other individual users are ""earning thousands"" and boasts here that he has [hundreds of thousands of accounts](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5cdtf4).

At this point, it looks very unlikely that we will be able to convince him to honor the payments. ***Does anyone have access to free legal advice to see what recourse we might have to recover our unpaid monies?*** 

A [Google search](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=adfocus+scam&amp;oq=adfocus+scam&amp;gs_l=hp.3...31417.38207.1.38866.18.14.4.0.0.0.396.4091.2-9j5.14.0...0.0.mKq5-DF1diQ&amp;psj=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a2e370afc0354df8&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=890) indicates that this may not be the first time he has withheld earnings once users started earning too much. What would the community think about taking steps to ensure that anyone thinking about using his service is made fully aware of the risk of withheld payments? 

tl;dr - Many users of this subreddit have been screwed over by Adfocus, shall we do something about it?


###Edit: THE DECISION HAS BEEN REVERSED AND PAYMENTS WILL APPARENTLY BE MADE AFTER ALL!!!

1342202114.0	wicvz	I think techlist is a phishing scam, xpost from mturk	skantman	126	62	74	"I have no proof of this, but here is what happened. Yesterday I received an email from techlist in my gmail inviting me to participate in a survey about words. I cannot remember the exact questions but it involved inputting words with personal relevance, and at the end it asked me to create a secure password. Before submitting the form I looked at my answers and thought, ""you know if someone wasn't careful they could easily enter information into this survey that could be used to phish their passwords."" This morning I got an email from Amazon, 'As a precaution, we've reset your Amazon.com password because you may have been subject to a ""phishing"" scam.' I checked out the only other active survey by techlist, which is asking questions about whether you use specific social media services. That is innocuous enough, but it seems like with a few different surveys could be used to build a pretty good phishing profile for a turker, then they would just need to get your email address. Maybe I need a tin foil hat, but I'm not doing techlist hits anymore.  

Additionally, [searching the subreddit shows](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/search?q=techlist&amp;restrict_sr=on) they are collecting phone numbers, mining words, and social media habits.

Edit: I'm still on the fence on this. Everything is circumstantial and could be just an unfortunate coincidence. I still think their HITs are a bit sketchy from a potential fishing perspective, but I don't want to falsely accuse a legit requester. Personally, I will avoid techlist from now on, but as long as everyone is cautious about entering personal info and have good password practices there shouldn't be anything to worry about.

**Update**: [mturk_techlist](http://www.reddit.com/user/mturk_techlist) has [put my mind](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wicvz/i_think_techlist_is_a_phishing_scam_xpost_from/c5duv9n) at ease regarding their HITs. I have no reason to suspect techlist is phishing, and I am grateful for their contributions to the mturk community. I regret using such alarmist language in my post title."	t5_2tgoz	True

New Turkers Please Read	golfguy671	72	9	15	"I am not a professional turker by any means but I try to post quite a bit, answer questions, and do quite a few surveys a day. Thus I felt the need to post a QUICK version of the FAQ for people that don't want to read all of it. I feel this is like a corollary to Miss Ditsie. If you think this is pointless, please tell me and I will delete it.

AC-Means ""attention check"" check to see if you are reading carefully


MC-Is ""memory check"" to see if you remember what you read


TO-Is turkopticon, a review system for requestors


HWTF-A ""Hit Worth Turking For"" is something that takes around $.10/minute!


A proper posting format would be something like-US/ICA-Requestor-HIT-Pay/Time-Any Other Qualifications (the last time I will post this!)


Search before posting and delete your posting if someone else posts before you! Even if it is by a minute.


Anything that pays over $5.00 may be fake so be weary


The FAQ is wonderful but it appears no one is reading it! I hope this helps and if there is anything else you find you are answering questions about a lot please let me know and I will include it.

EDIT: Check the NEW tab after writing up post but BEFORE posting (to check for duplicates). credit nowayhozay

1334345873.0	s8eq3	[Announcement] - On Spoilers and Attention Checks	wildncrazyguy	74	9	54	"The mods here at r/HWTF have striven to remain neutral about what is posted in this subreddit. We as mods have simply tried to listen to you and work as the mechanics to keep things running smoothly and efficiently. 

But something has recently cropped up in a few posts that we felt it needed it's own announcement. One that endangers the long term viability of this community, and that could endanger the prevalence of good paying studies on mTurk: *The posting of answers to survey attention checks.*

To an extent, we understand why these have been posted from time to time. It is simply quicker to fill out a survey without putting much thought into the actual survey questions - and just quickly looking for the attention checks. 

But this provides no real benefit to the survey requesters. It's comparable to them handing out free money. In fact, as a consequence, some researchers on Reddit have already posted a warning about this in one of their communities.

In addition, providing a link to the debriefing page - revealing the harmless deception in some surveys - subverts the entire purpose of the research and completely discredits the work.

-----

We as turkers should be able to understand the error here. It's equivalent to the scammy requester who rejects your HIT. Profiting off of your work, but not giving you anything in return. We warn people about doing HITs for scammy requesters. Requesters don't really have that option, but they do have the option of abandoning mTurk altogether if it gets too scammy.

Do unto others, if you will.

-----

So we're asking you to please refrain from posting HIT spoilers. HIT spoilers pertain to:

 * Publishing a study's debriefing page.
 * Publishing the actual attention question(s).
 * Publishing the answer to an attention check.
 * Indicating the page number of the attention check.
 * Providing the number of attention checks.

**You are still welcome to indicate whether there are attention checks - as doing so will fulfill its job of making people pay attention.**

Also, please be careful that your post description is not a spoiler to a study's intent - if it was purposefully hidden and only revealed to you in the study debriefing.

-----

#####Take Action

If you see someone posting spoilers, we encourage you to flag their post/comment.

The mods will be on the lookout for these and politely ask them to edit/delete their post. If they fail to do so in a reasonable amount of time (10 minutes), we will actively moderate and delete it for them. Repeat offenders will be handled on a case by case basis, but after the third offense, we reserve the right to ban that account.

The end result is that we have will have a more sustainable community that works with requesters, not against them. We hope you understand.

Holidays are always slow for turking, making December somewhat lackluster. Things should be bouncing back to normal soon and next month will be the one year anniversary of the sub--keep an eye out for news on plans to mark the occasion! Before getting into the rewards, we'd like to address a couple items that have come up this month:

---

**Downvoting**
---

There have been a number of discussions and quite a bit of chatter on the subject of downvoting recently. More specifically, the option of using CSS to hide the downvote button on posts has been advocated. As this is a subject that has been debated a number of times over the course of the subreddit, the mods felt that a fresh decision might wait until a community survey planned to coincide with our one year anniversary.  However, it has become clear that quite a few submitters are growing increasingly frustrated with seemingly unmerited downvotes and a lack of action on the matter. 

So, we have created a single question survey for the community to judge if a majority now supports doing away with the button:

**http://kwiksurveys.com/app/showpoll.asp?qid=72670&amp;sid=ly9587bs5awt1um72670&amp;new=True**

Without going into great length rehashing all the arguments for and against, here are a few points to consider:

1. We cannot 'remove' the ability to Downvote from Reddit. That feature is an integral part of the Reddit system, and the best we can do is 'hide' the button, as we already do with HITs marked 'dead'. Anyone can disable custom CSS to see the arrow, or select the post and hit Z to downvote.

2. As there are many more users than mods, it's not practical to sit and watch every post come in. The main way the community has of weeding through bad posts is downvotes. Should the button be hidden, it will more important than ever for folks to actively comment to point out stinkers and such.

3. People only post HITs so long as the 'reward' outweighs the 'work'. If posters feel discouraged because of a 'rash' of downvoting, they will not feel so inclined to provide the work, and the quantity and quality of posted HITs will drop. While active posters may be in the minority here, you may wish to give extra thought to their perspective and the effect their leaving the community might have if you're not among their ranks.

**Ethics**
---

1. We as a community only exist because requesters post HITs on mTurk. If the quality of our work is not good enough for them to continue to do that, we will not have HITs 'worth turking for'.

2. We only support the honest and ethical practice of doing HITs for which you HONESTLY qualify for. If a HIT asks for only females, please only take if you are female, same for christian, hispanic, 38 year-old single guy that lives in his mom's basement, etc. 

3. There are 5 Moderators, all who have jobs, or do our own turking, and have our own lives. There are thousands of users. We cannot, nor do we wish to police everyone. We strongly believe that 'MORE SPEECH' is the defense against 'BAD SPEECH'. If you see someone making comments about how to 'cheat' a HIT or giving away spoiler information, please comment, down vote it, then report it AND message the moderators. Our current policy is to give the OP some time to correct their statement, and only remove it if they seem unwilling or unable to do so. 

4. HIT Requesters frequent this community. The ones we know about have been given a blue 'R' flair, and any who read this and do not have it, please let us know and we will set it for you. That being stated, They are going to see the good with the bad, and the only way to make sure they think well of us is if there is a bad comment visible, that it is downvoted to oblivion and has a lot of people calling out the OP for being unethical. 


###The Community Pool

**Direct Contributions**
---

December saw a bit of a decline in contributions with 24 members kicking in a total of $32.98 through Amazon Payments.  A further $1 was generously left riding in the pot by one of the November Winners. As always, I’d like to encourage anyone earning a bit more through this sub to drop a buck or two in the bucket.

[ ](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/paymentsend?&amp;targetAccount=hitsworthturkingfor%40gmail.com)

If you do and would like shinny coin next to your username, please include it in the additional notes field of the send money page.

**Pollbuzzer**
---
Though not as good as last month, Pollbuzzer referrals earned a welcome $20 for the rewards. If you haven’t already, take a look at signing up under [the community referral link]( http://www.pollbuzzer.com/?r=N%2fqU9l7P%2f9OLB%2fE1GHXYQA%3d%3d) to see if it interests you. Further details can be found [in the FAQ here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/wiki/index#toc_10)

### The Awards:
As always the total pool of $53.98 has been divided between the ten highest voted HITs and the subreddit's [top five contributors](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit_stats/comments/15u0xc/subreddit_stats_hitsworthturkingfor_top_posts/) (courtesy of BBoe's Subreddit Stats).

Those who have won an award will receive a message from a mod that will contain a link to a HIT on mTurk created specifically for you. You'll also be given a unique passcode that you must enter on the HIT to receive your award.

The HIT will expire 2 weeks after you receive the message. If you do not accept it within those 2 weeks, it will be forfeited and added back to the pool. Sorry, no exceptions. Please also be aware that the contributors of the top 3 highest rated posts for December will not be eligible for the top 3 award spots in January.

1362502913.0	19pr1x	Announcement - February Awards, Disappearing Downvotes and the Continued Rise of Our Robot Overlords	ofnoaccount	62	4	21	"###Announcements:

---

##Rise of the Machines

The hit_bot has been running smoothly and grows thirsty for power! To that end, it has finagled itself a mod position and will use its newfound dominion to automatically apply ""Dead"" link-flair to any HIT that is no longer available. If it makes a mistake, please reply to its comments to let it know. Though of course, most failures [can only be attributable to human error](http://i.imgur.com/OpQB4yE.jpg/).

---

## Long Delayed Downvote Poll Results

In response to a number of posters feeling frustrated by seemingly unmerited downvotes, we ran a quick poll to see if the community wanted to hide the downvote button on posts. We meant to act on it much more quickly  but it kinda got shuffled to the wayside.. Please accept our apologies for that. 

237 users responded and a fairly substantial majority voted to hide the button:

* 167 voted in favor of hiding the button

* 70 voted in favor of keeping it 

[Screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/IdlRG) 

So, as of today the downvote button will no longer be visible on posts.  As downvoting has until now been one of the main ways for community members to express their opinions on HITs posted here, **it is more important than ever to leave comments and feedback**. We'll be evaluating this change over the coming weeks to see how it affects the quality of the sub.  

 
---

###Awards

Unfortunately, February has seen a decline in income for the community pool. This month we only have $31.34 for the rewards. A large portion of that was from direct contributions from users appreciative of our sub's lovely posters.

If your turking income is higher than it would be without the sub, please consider throwing a little back into the community to help encourage the posting of great HITs. A larger pool leads to a larger incentive to share HITs!

[](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/paymentsend?&amp;targetAccount=hitsworthturkingfor%40gmail.com)

If you have donated and would like shiny coin next to your username, please include it in the additional notes field of the send money page.

Also, take a look at [Pollbuzzer](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/wiki/index#wiki_contributing_to_the_community_pool) if you haven't already and consider signing up under [the community referral link](http://www.pollbuzzer.com/?r=N%2fqU9l7P%2f9OLB%2fE1GHXYQA%3d%3d).

Those who have won an award will receive a message from a mod that will contain a link to a HIT on mTurk created specifically for you. You'll also be given a unique passcode that you must enter on the HIT to receive your award.
The HIT will expire 2 weeks after you receive the message. If you do not accept it within those 2 weeks, it will be forfeited and added back to the pool. Sorry, no exceptions. Please also be aware that the contributors of the top 3 highest rated posts for February will not be eligible for the top 3 award spots in March.

1340570886.0	vjdsa	Discussion - Is it the responsibility of posters to remove dead HITs?	turkmagurk	88	31	70	"I'm going to start off by saying thank you to this subreddit for showing me the ropes.  I've only been doing this for the last 2 days, and everyone's guidance here and at /mturk has helped a lot.

That being said, I got into a brief discussion with a self-proclaimed ""turkvet"" about whether or not to tag dead links.  It's my contention that for the community to work, we have to focus on *HITsWorthTurkingFor*.  A link to a dead HIT will yield, well, zero dollars for the turker (and by any stretch, is not worth it).

I understand if the poster is AFK and has not gotten the chance to tag the link as dead, but it's entirely a different story when leaving it up is purposeful- in order to garner clicks for monetization.  It's not a good endgame if this is the focus. 

I think it's especially important because as little as 10 upvotes will land a post on the front page of this subreddit, incentivizing someone to dupe others.

I'm always happy to click a fellow turkers' shortened link- after all, they've done the service of finding and posting.  But when we're using the threshold of $0.10/min for a HWTF, the additional 10 seconds for each bad link add up (5 to wait for the ad, 5 to go back, close the broken HIT, and then downvote the post).  Go through several of these dead HITs, and they quickly start to eliminate any profitability for anyone besides the original poster (who has purposefully left the post up knowing the HIT was dead).

We then start to see a Tragedy of the Commons problem, where people are posting in hopes of turning a profit through clicks, as opposed to using it to foster a community of finding good HITs.  Extend it further and this subreddit no longer has any value.  

I may be new here, and I'm sorry if I'm ruffling any feathers/jimmies, but I'd like to see this subreddit for its intention- and a link to a dead HIT is *NOT worth turking for.*  Thoughts?

**TL; DR: Please mark your dead HITs and not try to skim additional pennies off of fellow HTWF'ers.**

We've had to reject more responses than usual in the last couple weeks, and the majority of them were due to people copy/pasting and using templates. We can't use that type of response, since it looks like it was generated by a program/script, and we've seen a lot more of those lately. Sometimes our approvers will use the reason that it looks like scripting, when it's actually copy/pasting, but from our end it's sometimes hard to tell the difference.

I'd like to note that we don't gain anything from rejecting submissions. We immediately repost any rejected HITs, so we're not trying to fill any quotas or anything like that. In a perfect world for us every submission would be acceptable. Rejecting, reposting, and re-reviewing submissions costs our company time and money.

Also, we don't automate our approvals. We have people reviewing every response, which is why we're a lot slower than other Requesters. If there's a delay in approval, it's not an indication that we don't like your work, it's just that we haven't gotten to it yet.

So, here's some basic things to avoid when writing for us (i.e. the most common things we have to reject for): using templates, repeating titles, starting every title with the same two words, making up names when none are provided, implying rape, implying incest, implying anyone is underage, unreadable grammar or spelling, copying existing titles from other websites, and racism.

1341957086.0	wcmr4	Announcement - Adfocus Account Bans	ofnoaccount	60	10	84	"As most of you have probably already seen from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/), a number of users have had their Adfocus account banned. The HWTF community account has also been banned. The reason given is ""Your account has been banned for Incentive/gift.""

There are three potential reasons for the bans:

1. Adfocus is considering the HITs themselves as a cash incentive. 

2. They consider the monthly rewards to be a cash incentive for clicking links. 

3. The survey included an Adfocus link and said a prize would be awarded to one person taking it.

Each of there reasons can be seen as subjective and we do not yet know Adfocus's rationale. For now, if your account is still active, I would recommend not using Adfocus here. It is also possible that similar issues could come up with Adfly in future as their TOS is almost identical, if not more restrictive. 

It would be helpful if anyone with Adfocus account could comment here and say whether or not:

1.  ..you've been banned.

2. ..you signed up under the community referral link.

3. ..you clicked the Adfocus survey link.

4.  ..you requested payment this month (or had auto-payment enabled in your settings)

I don't know if any of us are going to be able to recover our earnings and I apologize for adding the Adfocus referral link in the first place, especially as they have a sketchier reputation than Adfly.

Lastly, on the off chance that anyone here has some background in contract law, are you aware of any legal recourse we might have? Even were it not ultimately pursued, it would be good to know all of our options. 

**Edit:** So far it looks like the sole common factor is signing up under the referral link, with one anomaly. The exact pertinent line from the TOS is:

&gt;  You agree to not use the Service to....offer any form of incentive to users who click on an AdFoc.us link, not limited to points/bonus/money/gifts/traffic or link exchange.

It's still unclear if they include the monthly rewards under that category or if ""link exchange"" is the alleged violation.   

Here's the text of the ticket I've submitted in case anyone's interested:

&gt; When trying to log into my account today, I received an error message saying my account had been banned. I have not previously received any ""Warnings"" or ""Red Flags"" to comply with, as your TOS clearly states will be issued prior to a ban. 

&gt; Please clarify the exact reason for why my account has been banned and further why no warnings or red flags for compliance were sent prior to the event. 

&gt; Additionally, please inform me of your intended course of action regarding the earned income on my account that has not yet been paid.

&gt; Sincerely,

**2nd Edit:** So of everyone who has commented here, with two exceptions so far,  it seems that anyone connected with subreddit in any way has been banned. It doesn't matter whether they signed up under the referral link or even ever posted an adfocus link anywhere. It also appears that the bans are ongoing, so odds are everyone will eventually be banned. Also, the survey looks to be completely unrelated. 

If anyone has not already [submitted a ticket](http://adfoc.us/support/), you may wish to do so. 

If the person running Adfocus chooses to cancel accounts, that's basically his prerogative. If decides to pocket everyone's earnings as well when he's surely already been paid by the advertisers, I would call that unacceptable.

**If he refuses to pay, would people want to help ensure that others thinking of using his service are aware of the risks involved?** 

3rd Edit: The bloke from adfocus has left a [few comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/c5cd6sb) on [the other discussion thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wbxqv/discussion_my_adfocus_account_just_got_banned/)

* [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/): (abbreviated 'TO' on this subreddit) A website where turkers come together and rate the requesters that we work for. Turkopticon also has an incredibly useful extension that displays the community ratings of requesters right on the mTurk site.

* AutoPager: Automatically loads the next search results page as you scroll down. *Turkopitcon and Block Requester don't display on extended search pages.*

**SCRIPTS** 
--- 
*For Firefox you'll need to install [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) to run these. For Chrome, [Tapermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) will make these easier to install and some require it.*

* [Block Requesters](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/130929): This script lets you block/ignore requesters from your search results. It will place a little 'x' beside each requester's name. To block, just click the 'x'. This helps clean up your search results, and saves you time when you block scammers/requesters with poor ratings. *Props to [xxdohxx](http://www.reddit.com/user/xxdohxx) for reviving this script and fixing it so it works in Chrome!*

*  [Pending Earnings](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150354): Adds up your pending earnings and displays them on your dashboard below your total earnings. 

*  [Today's Projected Earnings](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150355): Similar to above except it totals your projected earnings for the day. It doesn't take bonuses into account though.  

* [Expanded Header Info](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/126924): Displays your account balance and worker ID in the header. Just put your mouse cursor over your WorkerID to select it and CTRL+C to copy.

* [Requester ID &amp; Auto Approval Time](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/130470): Displays the Requester ID in case they change their name and the HIT's auto approval time.

* [Amazon Payments mTurk Details](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/86823): Adds details for mTurk transactions to your Account Activity page.

* [MTurk HIT DataBase](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/149548): Extended ability to search HITs you have worked on and other useful tools. ***New***

* [MTurk Dashboard Change Notifier](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/145373): Shows changes in submitted HITs, bonuses and earnings since last page load. ***New***

* [MTurk Worst Case Scenario Calculator](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/145119): Shows what your approval rate would be in worst case scenario and how many rejections it will take to drop your approval percentage. ***New***

* [MTurk Status Page Chart](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/145103): Adds some eyecandy &amp; graphs to your Amazon Mechanical Turk status page. ***New***

* [MTurk Dashboard HIT Status links](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/145118): Adds quick links to rejected and pending HITs. ***New***

* [Mturk Block Individual Requests](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150665): Similar to the Block Requesters script, but for individual HITs. *Created by redditor [turksquatch](http://www.reddit.com/user/turksquatch)* ***New***

* [Turk Worker ID Display](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150674): Displays your worker ID on HIT preview and accept pages, as well as on Qualtrics and Surveymonkey - visually gets in the way of the Extended Header script a bit. *Created by redditor [turksquatch](http://www.reddit.com/user/turksquatch)* ***New***

##Open the pod bay doors, HAL

A very helpful and talented Redditor has written a bot for the benefit of HWTF. It follows the links in each post, checks to see if the HIT is still up, and leaves a comment. It frequently re-checks HIT status and updates its comment accordingly. If all goes well, we hope to have it automatically mark dead HITs in the near future! In addition to these useful features, the bot links the TO page of the each HIT's Requester and the page for you to leave your own review.
At the bottom of of the hit_bot’s comments you’ll notice an adfly link. Clicking that link will help the bot’s creator earn a little extra money but doing so is of course entirely voluntary. If the bot gets anything wrong, please comment ! If you have any suggestions or concerns, please let us know!

###Awards

January was another slow month for us here at HITsWorthTurkingFor. We pooled a total of $43.68 this month and a large portion of that was by direct contributions from turkers like you. If you see a fellow turker here with a gold coin beside their name, please take a second out of your time to thank them for helping us make this a thriving community for turkers.

If you feel that we've added a boost to your turking income, you can help support this community and the community pool by sending a little of that back our way.

[](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/paymentsend?&amp;targetAccount=hitsworthturkingfor%40gmail.com)

If you have donated and would like shiny coin next to your username, please include it in the additional notes field of the send money page.

Those who have won an award will receive a message from a mod that will contain a link to a HIT on mTurk created specifically for you. You'll also be given a unique passcode that you must enter on the HIT to receive your award.
The HIT will expire 2 weeks after you receive the message. If you do not accept it within those 2 weeks, it will be forfeited and added back to the pool. Sorry, no exceptions.

I took your guys' advice and added in a way for people to check if you previously participated in this study prior to accepting the HIT.  It is not required that you check on your own, though, as there is an automatic check on the first page of the survey.

1356395495.0	15ecw3	Discussion - Question about downvotes/upvotes	TURKseason	86	37	50	"I know its been talked about a lot lately, but one thing I have thought about the whole voting situation: Would it make sense when counting the total votes for awards at the end of the month, to just count the upvotes and completely ignore the downvotes? That way, all the upvotes are counted AND downvotes could still be used for whatever the downvoter wants it to count for (either marking it as a hit they've taken, downvoting it since they see it as a bad hit, or whatever other reason they have).

This has been really bugging me lately and I think I'm just going quit HWTF it this keeps up unfortunately. It gets really discouraging to keep seeing posts get downvoted when they don't deserve to get downvoted in any way. 


As it is, I think this will probably be my last month posting hits on here. It was fun, but as I said, it really gets discouraging and I can take a hint I'm not liked when I'm getting enough downvotes to reduce the upvotes by half. To all other top posters/regular posters, I hope it gets better, I really do.

1372369235.0	1h7g0r	[Meta] - Adding {Writing} &amp; {Timer} tag to hit posts. For some of us, writing tasks are very laborious. And it's not always obvious from the outset whether a hit has writing in it. Not just 'words or a sentence', but when you have to 'think of an answer' and freeform a block of text.	AlienIntelligence	49	2	33	"As the title said... for some of us the writing tasks just don't work and are NEVER a HWTF (It's not the hit poster's fault). 

So, you choose a hit, then you put in a minute or two, and bam, it has writing in it. At this point you can either quit and have wasted all that time and get no pay for it, which now negates work you did on other hits... 1:1. Or you forge ahead and get 1/2 - 1/4 the value for the hit because it takes so long to answer. Bringing you down to a cool $3/hr.

And I obviously don't mean 'a phrase or a short sentence', but when they say 'think of a time' and you have to freeform a block of text. Those NEVER end well.

So, thoughts? {Writing} tag on posts? People don't always comment that there is writing, so that's not a solution.

Maybe also a {Timer} tag? {Timer 2x - 3m} {Timer 2m} Because that affects how quickly you can do a task as well. That's any page of a hit that doesn't show the next/arrow until a certain amount of time goes by.

I think those two items greatly affect whether it's a HWTF."	t5_2tgoz	True

1370625449.0	1fvg0l	Announcement - April and May Awards	wildncrazyguy	48	2	10	"###Announcements

Hello fellow Turkers!

##April Awards - Sorry for the delay

Sorry everyone for the delay of the April awards announcement. We had a slight hiccup in operations and are looking into a solution to remedy this. I had a long, heartfelt explanation of why this happened and some serious concern for one of our mods who went missing for over a month.

But the good news is that our long lost mod has reappeared and is okay. That is what's most important.

Since April awards were so late, we've decided to process the May awards along with them. Again, sorry for the delay. We are working diligently to consolidate all of our income streams and streamline our processing methods so that, hopefully, we can sustain timely operations in the future.


---

###Awards

As stated above, April was a tough month for us here at HITsWorthTurkingFor. We have a total payout of $37.46 for April. 

In addition, May's payout was slightly higher at $38.35.

Much of our revenue is sourced from users like you.

If you see a fellow turker here with a gold coin beside their name, please take a second out of your time to thank them for helping us make this a thriving community for turkers.

If you feel that we've added a boost to your turking income, you can help support this community and the community pool by sending a little of that back our way.

[](https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/paymentsend?&amp;targetAccount=hitsworthturkingfor%40gmail.com)

If you have donated and would like shiny coin next to your username, please include it in the additional notes field of the send money page.

The AdFoc.us accounts associated with this subreddit were banned yesterday following an uncovering of the intentions of this subreddit's ""community pool."" There has been discussion regarding the clarity of the TOS and what exactly is going to happen with all of the money from these accounts.

In circumstances where we are 100% confident a user is violating our rules we do not offer compensation or payment of earnings. This is clear in our TOS.

In this circumstance, I'll admit we need to make improvement to the wording of our TOS. I was not 100% confident. I am working to revise a more clearly worded TOS to ensure that future users are aware of the rules.

That said, **I am going to be paying all of the earnings up through June 30, 2012 for all account associated with this community**. You should be able to login to your account and view the ""Requested"" payment which I ask that you verify. If your account is missing (some of the &lt; $10 ones have to be manually added) please post here your account ID only.

After these earnings are paid, we'll be placing a permanent ban in our TOS for this subreddit as we cannot accept it. Please understand this is not personal at all - just based on the extremely poor quality we received from the traffic here.

I apologize for the inconvenience and frustration. Cheers!

1341252823.0	vxnna	Announcement - HITsWorthTurkingFor June Awards	ofnoaccount	56	13	37	"**Greetings Turking Redditors!**

Another month has passed and our small community is no longer very small. What started as an uneventful June blew up rather unexpectedly with a veritable fountain of fresh blood. This lead to some challenges and growing pains, but we appear to have come out the other side stronger than where we started. 

---

###First, a couple of Announcements:

**Gosh, That Got Big Quick..**
---

Recently, an innocent comment on a popular Ask Reddit post opened the flood gates of the sub to a sea of enthusiastic new turkers. This has had both positive and negative consequences. On the down side, posted HITs are getting tapped out at a faster pace, it's taken time for folks to get used to the sub's unique etiquette, and everyone's nerves have gotten a bit frayed by the addition of well meaning but inexperienced new members. On the plus side, there's been an increase in the number of HITs posted (most of which are now as worth turking for as before), the extra revenue to be earned by posting has risen and the community pool has quadrupled in size. 

Things are now leveling out as those who find turking worthwhile stay and contribute and others realize how many pictures of cats they've missed out on seeing while filling in bubbles ([¿por qué no los dos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor+cats/)). Keep in mind that while our numbers have certainly increased, the displayed subscribers doesn't subtract those who unsubscribe and is not an accurate indication of sub users.  

Thank you to all new users that have weathered the downvotes and worked out how to contribute and to all the old ones for their patience. Special thanks to members such as emisan, golfguy671, fireflygirlie and everyone else who've taken the time to answer questions and offer advice. (Apologies to the many others I've forgotten to mention by name).  

**Community Survey**
---

Three months ago, we ran a survey of our then new subreddit to solicit feedback on how you'd like to see the community run. We promised that when we hit 6,000 subscribers, we'd do it again. It was a tad unexpected to see our numbers grow by that figure in just two days, but it only increases the need to evaluate how the sub is working. Aarinfel has collated the most commonly voiced suggestions and concerns into a brief survey. In the lead up to it, we'll be posting one discussion thread every day on the topic of each of its larger questions. Once the survey has been posted, it will run for one week.  

---

###The Awards:

This month we have raised a whopping total of $140.66 for the community pool. Of that: 

* $80.62 from Adfocus (including $10.96 from links directly posted by m1327)

* $47.04 from Adfly 

* $13.00 from direct contributions and rewards left riding in the pool from last month


The pool has been divided between the ten highest voted HITs and the subreddit's [top five contributors](http://www.reddit.com/r/subreddit_stats/comments/vvcmu/subreddit_stats_hitsworthturkingfor_top/) (courtesy of BBoe's Subreddit Stats). In order for the payouts system to be more sustainable and to prevent the mods needing to cover them using their own money and accounts, we have begun setting aside 20% of the pool as a reserve until we have built up a cushion. The mods are again forfeiting a percentage of the pool, but that may change next month dependent on survey feedback. 

As we've far exceeded the $36 minimum payouts, all of the rewards winners are receiving a percentage of the total pool instead of the minimums. Details of how the awards and reserve break down can be found in the [""Split Pool (June 2012)"" sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AijbPPknAJmGdE9wOHBQc2xHZ01lVkprS3Bsb21SSWc#gid=14). Further details can be found in the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/HITsWorthTurkingFor#Whatarethepayoutlevels).

Given the substantial size of the pool this month, there will unfortunately be a 10-14 day delay before payments while we wait for the link monetizer income to clear. Once we've built up a reserve, the awards will once again be issued more promptly.

***And now, The Winners!***

*Discussion threads have been excluded from both categories. Compiled at 22:00 AKST, June 30th*

Finally, to those who ""won"" in June, to claim your award, you will receive a message from the mods that will contain a link to a HIT on mTurk created specifically for you. You'll also be given a unique passcode that you must enter on the HIT to receive your award.
The HIT will expire 2 weeks after you receive the message. If you do not accept it within those 2 weeks, it will be forfeited and added back to the pool. Sorry, no exceptions. Please also be aware that the contributors of the top 3 highest rated posts for June will not be eligible for the top 3 award spots in July.

Crowdsource - http://adf.ly/RcEcB  (sometimes these are not HWTF, make sure its at least .04 per search)

There's two scripts that help you do these:

Google Ordered Lists ( http://adf.ly/RcDtk ) which puts a number in front of search results.  Caveat: it adds an extra number to the first youtube result, so you can see 11 numbers on the first page sometimes when theres only 10 results, so keep an eye on that, still saves time.

Highlight Unhighlightable Text - requires tampermonkey ( http://adf.ly/RcE7w )

Highlight Unhighlightable Text - Crowdsource only, also needs tampermonkey ( http://adf.ly/RcEns )

Lets you copy and paste the search terms directly from the hit.  Heres the fastest way:

Double click on the first word

Hold down shift

Right click anywhere on the last word

Click search google for...

Honestly I get these done in 45-55 seconds.  I haven't done any since Tuesday, and I was about to get a little over 7 bucks in 35 minutes earlier.


Again, feel free to google the name of the script or mturk search the name of the requester if you want to skip the adfly process.  My feelings won't be hurt I promise!"	t5_2tgoz	True

1355980347.0	155hyo	[Discussion] - Downvoting Etiquette. 	Amandurp	81	42	84	"I've been noticing many HITs are getting large amounts of downvotes (including very quickly after they are posted) without people explaining why they are downvoting in the comments section. I also have noticed that my HITs will gain anywhere from 10-15 downvotes when I post in the morning and i'm not able to mark them dead after i've left for work.

I think the most ideal thing to do is remove the downvote button, but please be aware of these rules we have in place:

- **Do not downvote if a HIT is dead**. Many people can not sit at the computer refreshing constantly to see if their HIT has died. Simply leave a comment!

- **If you downvote a HIT, explain why in the comments section.** A downvote does nothing to explain *why* a HIT is bad, only a comment can do that (which is why I believe the downvote button has no use here). 

- **Do not downvote simply to keep track of what HITs you have done.** Although a downvote may hide the HIT entirely, seeing an upvote will also let you know you have taken the HIT. There are also scripts to help you keep track of your HITs, check them out in the ""Useful Links"" section of the sidebar ---&gt;

- **Above all, NEVER downvote simply to have the OP lose karma, increasing your chance of earning part of the community pool.** People who post HITs could be spending the time it takes to post a HIT taking more HITs, but instead for the good of the community, they post them here for us! Please thank them with an upvote and an adfly click. If they earn part of the pool, it's because they deserve it, and if you earn part of the pool, it's because you deserve it - please do not use the downvote button as a way to skew the results.

I've only been a part of this community for 7 months, but i've seen a bunch of changes (including the jump from 4k to over 10k subscribers). I think it's time for another change - removal of the downvote button - but i'd love community input on this as well!"	t5_2tgoz	True

1347229035.0	zme91	Discussion - Just a friendly reminder on submission etiquette	erratically_sporadic	52	14	36	"Hey all,

It has become apparent that there have been more new posters lately, which is great! I'd like to take this chance to not only welcome everyone, but also to kindly remind everyone on submission etiquette. If you haven't read the **HWTF** [**FAQ**](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/HITsWorthTurkingFor#HITsWorthTurkingForFAQ), please familiarize yourself with them.

Some general rules:

1 Hits that are typically worth turking for fall within the range of **10 cents per minute of completion** or less. **Accurate** estimations are important, if you underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete a HIT, you're not going to get upvotes. If you overestimate the time, it may not fall within the HWTF category.

Note: there are exceptions to this rule, such as possible bonuses. For most, a decent bonus is usually worth taking a little more time for the base HIT. For example, **.20/5min + possible .50 bonus**: in my opinion, usually worth taking, even if the bonus was not achieved.

2 Remember to put all the information of the HIT within the post, in the proper format, in the correct area. 

* Area available, HIT title, Requester name, pay/time taken, other quals: all should be **in the title**.

* Other info such as, **Attention checks, Memory checks, TO rating**, link to the HIT and anything else somewhat relevant to the HIT should be in the **comment area**.

* Other info such as **spoilers** should **NOT** go in the comments section **OR** title. If you wish to speak to anyone about a specific HIT, PM them instead of posting a comment.

3 If someone comments that your link is **dead or gone**, check the link, and mark it such if it is indeed gone. If more than one person comments that it is gone, it probably is. This helps keep the new queue and hot queue clear of unnecessary clutter and makes it easier to turk.

Another note: if you dead your link and it actually *is* dead, the ability to downvote is taken away. If your link is dead but its still designated as active, you can (and most certainly will) receive downvotes. Just common courtesy.

4 Make sure your post **isn't a recent repost.** If you and someone else post the same HIT, the one that was posted first should keep the priority. You can check who posted first by hovering your mouse over the submission times of each. If you did repost, either **delete your HIT or at the very least, mark it as dead.**

5 If someone asks a question about your posted HIT, **you should probably answer them**. They may be confused or concerned. If you had a different experience with that HIT, share it. Also if they give a suggestion, believe it or not, it is to your benefit to listen to them in many cases.

6 If you have questions, either mark your thread as a ""Discussion"" thread or go to /r/mturk to ask it. If you do make a Discussion thread, please have your title be as clear and obvious as possible so we can understand what its about.

These are just some general rules that come to mind, please add more if you can think of any. Also this would be a great place to ask any questions if you have any.

EDIT: I've been afk for a few hours (breaking my own rule number 5, opps) but I'm super happy to see discussion. You guys are great and thats why this subreddit is great."	t5_2tgoz	True

College is starting soon and Its gonna be even harder. On august 1 I was pretty much left with only $200 in my bank account. 

Now I had a job before those $200 and it was paying me around $400 a month because I only worked 2x overnight a week. That was $8 an hour but only 6-7 hours. Granted the job didn't pay well but it was balls to the wall hard because it was overnight and it ruined the next day for me as well because I slept through it. They let me go because they didn't need me. Oh well. Its been a month and no reply from any job I have applied to. 

Back to the $200, I was low on the budget because of my recent PC which cost quite a bit. I don't want to sell it, its a life long dream to build it and its been accomplished.

Now thanks to mturk and you guys I get todo whatever I want the whole day and enjoy the hell out of my life. 

Literally I can sit home and watch netflix all I want and do surveys on the side. I have made $200 this month or will make by the end of the month(projected). I can 2-3x more because right now I don't do that many surveys yet. I spend maybe 2 hours a day while watching netflix. 

Now some of you guys might freak out on only 200-300 a month but to a college students, who doesn't dorm but rather lives at home(its a mile bike ride or $5,000 for the dorm). This is a lot and covers all my expenses considering I don't do drugs as that is a lot of waste of money. 


So thanks to you guys I am actually stable and pretty good right now.

Hopefully I am posting this in the correct subreddit.  If I am not, someone please point me in the right direction rather than downvoting me into oblivion.

I'm using a different account than my usual Reddit.  I'd prefer folks not associate me with all the um . . . well, we're all Redditors, here, right . . . you know what we all do and say around here.

So, anyhoo . . . all feedback is welcome.  Please don't beat me up, but solid negative feedback is appreciated.

Thanks.

**FIRST EDIT** I'm pleased with the response I'm getting.  Many thanks for all the involvement, fellow Redditors!

I have addressed the issue with visited links.  Refresh and clean cache if you noted it and aren't yet seeing it.

TO links are definitely the first big item when I dig into this site again.

Dead HITs are something I'm hoping to build a bot to handle in version 0.2 or 0.3.

Keep em coming!  I'm probably going to go to bed soon.  Again: THANKS!!

**SECOND EDIT** 

Categories will be in the next update.

Sorting by time, pay and score will also.  Maybe more.  We'll see.

**THIRD EDIT**

I do have a few Qs for the mods, but I'll just harass you guys via PM on Monday-ish.  Tonight is for beer and hockey.  I will still check in periodically to see if any fresh comments roll in, but for now this is starting to sound of crickets.
