1350773237.0	11tgim	How Jailbreak Actually Works.	Synchronizing	668	50	97	"    Intro to Jailbreak

A lot of people do not know how jailbreak actually works. They think it's simply plugging in their devices to a computer, pressing a button, waiting couple of minutes, and voilá. The reality is, it is a bit more complex than that.

I will try to explain to the best of my ability on how jailbreak actually works, and hopefully by the end of this entry you will have an idea how it functions.

    What does Jailbreak actually means?

Jailbreak actually means to allow third-party applications to be installed into your iDevice. Contrary to popular beliefs, it's actually fully legal to run third-party applications on your device since James H. Billington's [DMCA](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.2281.ENR:) revision. Having this in mind the only thing that prevents us from having an easy jailbreak is Apple.

    How does the jailbreak works?

Jailbreak itself is getting control over the root and media partition of your iDevice; where all the iOS's files are stored at. To do so */private/etc/fstab* must be patched.

fstab is the switch room of your iDevice, controlling the permission of the root and media partition. The default is 'read-only', allowing eyes and no hands. To be able to modify the root and media partition we must set the fstab to 'read-write', allowing eyes and hands (on the root and media partitions).

Sounds easy? Maybe. The **main** problem is not getting the files in, but getting them trough various checkpoints. These checkpoints were put by Apple to verify if the file is indeed legit, or a third-party. Every file is signed by a key, and with out it, the file will be put aside and be unusable. 

So where do we get the key? Well, it's not as easy as it sounds. These keys are not simply given out like candy in a Halloween night, which means we must either unscrew the lock (patch all of the checkpoints) or go trough the backdoor (bypass). As Saurik said, ""patching this out is A) difficult (especially to track as Apple makes changes) and B) of marginal benefit as adding these hashes is easy."" In other words, it's not worth it.

Before I explain how we bypass these checkpoints, we must go over some other stuff.

    How does a iDevice bootup?

When an iDevice boots up it goes trough a ""chain of trust"". This chain is a series of signature checks that makes sure everything being ran is Apple approved. It goes on the following (specific) order:

* Runs Bootrom: Also called ""SecureROM"" by Apple, it is the first significant code that runs on an iDevice.
* Runs Bootloader: Generally, it is responsible for loading the main firmware. 
* Loads Kernel: Bridge between the iOS and the actual data processing done at the hardware level.
* Loads iOS: The final step to the chain, iOS starts and we get our nice ""Slide to Unlock"" view.

Great! Now that you know how your iDevice comes to life, let's go to the next thing.

    What is the roadbloack in a jailbreak?

What prevents an easy jailbreak is the signature checks. While the kernel is loading there are thousands of checks being done to make sure everything being loaded is Apple approved.

To be more specific, there are many checks trough out the boot which look for one thing, a signature, a key. If the key is correct we get a green light, if it is wrong, depending where the check was at or what file it was, it will either crash the iDevice causing a loop, or simply ignore it and does not execute that specific file at all.

    So what is a jailbreaker objective?

The jailbreaker objective is to either patch the checks or simply bypass them. The conventional way is to bypass them as patching all of them would be simply to time consuming and not very beneficial.

Thus bringing us to the two main exploit categories:

* bootrom exploit: Exploit done during the bootrom. It can't be patched by conventional firmware update, and **must** be patched by new hardware. Since it's before almost any checkpoint, the malicious code is injected before everything, thus allowing a passage way to be created to bypass all checks or simply disable them.

* userland exploit: Exploit done during or after the kernel has loaded and can easily be patched by Apple with a software update. Since it's after all the checks, it injects the malicious code directly into the openings back into the kernel. These openings are not so easy to find, and once found can be patched. 

Userland exploits is the most common of them two as they are easier to find, and are software based. 

    How did some of the released jailbreak actually worked?

* Limera1n (exploit, not tool): Bootrom exploit first used by Geohot. Due to it being a bootrom it can't  be patched by Apple with a software update, which means it is still usable today in all A4 devices. Yes... including iOS 6.
* JailbreakMe: Userland exploit that used a malformed CFF vulnerability. CFF stands for Compact Font Format and it's used to store fonts. Starting with PDF version 1.2 it could be imbedded directly into the .pdf file, but it had it's malfunctions. When you accessed Jailbreak.me via Safari on your iDevice, it would automatically check if you are vulnerable, and open up the PDF file with the edit CFF. When the CFF opcodes (operation code, specifies the operations to be performed) were being handled, Comex (the developer of this exploit), found a way to get a stack overflow (when to much memory is being used in one stack and it attempts to access memory outside of it's own stack), by repeatedly pushing and duplicating random numbers onto an ""argument stack"" (where arguments are stored). By doing so, it allowed Comex to execute any command he would like. The problem with this is that even though he had control over the commands, root is still set as 'read-only'. He would need to set root as 'read-write' so he could use the commands to his advantage, so Comex digged a bit further and found a IOSurface.framework vulnerability. It would actually use a ROP payload to get access to the kernel memory with 'read-write' privileges. From there, it's game over. He then would download wad.bin (Cydia), install, and restart springboard. You now have yourself a jailbroken device done by using a userland exploit in Safari. Keep in mind this exploit was huge. It still is categorized as the simplest (as in user term) and most effective jailbreak yet, while at the same time being a big worries to Apple. If someone could get into your Phone via Safari to install Cydia, someone could do the same to steal any information from your iDevice.

These are the two most know jailbreaks out there. Every other exploit is different, and usually patched by now.

    Conclusion

Jailbreak is not the easiest thing out there. It's time and skill demanding.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you understood everything. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the comments. If you have any concern, or if I may have written anything wrong aswell, feel free to contact me via message. I wrote the same thing over 5 times (for the past 5 hours) and might have gotten myself confused along the way.

    Thank You

The KS ran into APPLE approval problems, and is being downscaled a bit to get approval.  I want to encourage the KS project Developer (himself a jailbreaker) to build a fully-functional Jailbreak-only version of the hardware.  Here's the link to the previous project that had to be modified to get Apple approval [here!](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108290897/iexpander-an-expansion-device-for-your-iphone-4-an) .  Due to the Apple approvals, this KS is behind schedule quite a bit, but the creator is credible. 


If this page gets sufficient traction, I'll link the project creator to here to encourage him. So please upvote (self-post = no link karma) and comment.  


Only keep reading if you like reading. 

More Info: The main problem keeping Apple from approving the original project was the user-interchangeable Micro-SD memory (Apple hates you being able to buy more disk space easily).   Imagine: and extra 64 GB of storage for your device, accessible via a Cydia App that also does battery management. 

My intent was to use the case with my GoPro: slide the MicroSD card into the iPhone right after shooting, and then go over the video immediately, edit it, or delete it, or upload to youtube immediately w/o my laptop.  Or just have another MicroSD card with a few movies on it.  Or...  yeah. Flexibility that Apple doesn't want you to have. 

**TL;DR-   iPhone case offering user-expandable MicroSD memory and extended battery.  up-vote to encourage an experienced KickStarter creator who already wants to do this, but may need a little nudge.**

edit: the kickstarter linked to closed many months ago. It was delayed severely due to Apple approvals, but in a few months, you will be able to buy the device from this kickstarter for the iphone 4/4s or the i5, but it does not have SDmicro expandable memory. It has expandable memory in a different non-standard format.  This memory format change was due to needing to follow apple's rules with the hardware so that the interface app will get approved by the App Store.  The intent of this post is to encourage the Project Creator to do another Kickstarter for a jailbroken-only version (of the hardware and the software) that ignores apple's rules, after he finishes the current kickstarter.

Some of you have been frustrated by the flood of theme posts, and we're listening. Based on your suggestions and the explosion in recent activity, now seems like a good time to work together to build a new subreddit specifically for iOS themes: /r/iOSthemes

Use /r/iOSthemes to share your setup, troubleshoot, ask for suggestions, and link to great stuff. If you're not sure whether your post qualifies as a ""theme"" post (such as customizing icon layouts with tweaks), go ahead and post it there! Keep in mind that /r/iOSthemes is still under construction - we'll be fleshing out the sidebar and wiki, and we welcome meta suggestions of all kinds.

So, what happens when people post themes in /r/jailbreak now? It takes a while for everyone to notice new rules, especially people using mobile interfaces that don't show sidebars, so there will be a gentle transition. If moderators notice a theme post on /r/jailbreak that doesn't have any comments yet, we'll remove it and ask you to repost it at /r/iOSthemes instead. If your theme post already has lots of upvotes and comments, we won't destroy that - we'll just post a reminder to use /r/iOSthemes instead.

Please be patient with us if we don't remove posts right away (we have lives too!), and please be patient with each other as well during this transition. This is a bit of an experiment. Let's see how it goes!

1361188862.0	18qwai	AMAZING app idea: Fake power down. To trick thieves into thinking they've turned off your phone so you can still find it on findmyiphone. Self-post, no karma, plz upvote for visibility.	blackjackel	673	123	77	"I know there are apps that disable turning the phone off, but this is not enough because a thief may simply kill the phone by holding home and power.

So here's a simple yet amazing idea:

When a thief holds down the power button to try to shut the phone off, they get a ""fake"" slide-to-turn-off slider, one that looks like the apple slider but it's actually fake...

When the thief slides to turn off the phone does the ""Loading"" animation for a second then the screen (does exactly what an iphone does when turning off) then goes to black screen and the backlight is set to 0%. The phone looks like it's completely off. The phone is still on however, it just looks like it's off. Of course volume buttons and home button are disabled now.

Now the only way to turn it back on is to push a secret code in the volume buttons (something pre-configured), say up up, down down, up up. Or something like that.

This is so that when a thief steals your phone ant turns it off, you will still be able to track it on findmyiphone. 

Also, in order to be able to turn the phone off for real you would have to do some sort of pre-configurable jesture like hold volume up for 5 seconds THEN hold the power button to turn off.



Bonus Idea: ""Fake on"", after turning the phone off, if you hold the power button it will have a fake boot screen complete with the apple logo before going back to home screen, so that the thief doesn't realize he's being duped.

Please upvote this so maybe it will get some visibility and a developer might think about making this idea.

I've seen other compilation lists here, but none of them focused on the budget-minded, chaotic-good jailbreaker. So, here is my list for all the other newly jailbroken users out there who are frugal and don't want to pirate. There's gotta be at least a couple of you guys out there. Video links for your convenience.
 
* [StatusTab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wbAUTFTFXw) - allows you to pull down the status bar in full screen apps
* [NCTabClock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Q9qVeDO7o) - similar to StatusTab except shows only the clock
* [SwipeBack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEiOJ724Bo4) - brings swipe gesture navigation to iOS (similar to Alien Blue UI, for example)
* [SwipeSelection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h2yrBK7MAY) - keyboard modification to change the way selection and cursor movement are done (hard to describe, watch the video)
* [SwipeShiftCaret](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hCB1EKE4Hw) - simplier than SwipeSelection, good for non-English keyboards
* Activator - create your own UI shortcuts with gestures, button presses, swipes, etc.
* LastApp - use Activator to create shortcuts to your last app (I use double-tap on status bar)
* [NowNow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Vnew290QArs) - short press home to access Google voice search (needs Google search app installed)
* [DietBulletin](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/08/21/new-dietbulletin-tweak/) - shrinks notification banners to the size of the status bar
* [LowPowerBanner](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/02/24/lowpowerbanner/) - changes the lower power alert to a banner (so it doesn't take focus from app). Doesn't seem to play nice with DietBulletin at the moment.
* [BrightVol](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/12/10/brightvol/) - change brightness with volume buttons, but only after pressing both of them simultaneously (press again to revert back to volume)
* [SwipeAway](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/10/26/swipe-away/) - close all apps in app switcher by swiping up; or close inidividual apps by swiping down
* [Better Switcher Position](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/01/14/better-switcher-position/) - switches music icon and lock orientation icon positions on app switcher (good for lefties)
* [f.lux](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/10/01/f-lux/) - save your eyes at night, definitely worth installing
* [NCsettings](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/03/26/ncsettings/) - like SBSettings toggles, integrated in the notification center. Much more minimal looking.
* [Lorem](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/01/27/lorem/) - swipe notifications in notification center to dismiss them
* [QuickClear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJUaFwnWOqI) - single tap to clear notifications, a more subtle tweak than Lorem
* [BrowserChanger](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2010/05/25/browser-changer-open-links-in-third-party-browsers/) - change your default browser to Google Chrome, for example
* [MapsOpener](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/12/14/mapsopener/) - makes Google Maps the default maps app (doesn't work in Yelp unfortunately)
* Bytafont - changes your default font (Geo Sans Light and Droid Sans are popular on /r/jailbreak)
* [Delete Word](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/07/22/delete-word/) - do you use ctrl+backspace a lot? This brings shift+backspace similar functionality. I do notice a bit of lag with this one unfortunately.
* [DismissMyKeyboard](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/01/13/dismissmykeyboard/) - does your keyboard ever get in your way? Dismiss it by swiping right on the space button
* [Five Icon Dock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqjtLxlTdsM) - add a fifth icon to your dock
* [AutoProtect](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/05/10/autoprotect/) - poor man's CleverPin: won't ask for passcode at lockscreen when on home wifi
* Wallpaper+ - did that subtle black gradient/shadow on your wallpaper ever bother you? This tweak gets rid of it and makes your wallpaper appear true to color.
* [AlbumArt on AppSwitcher](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/12/13/albumart-on-appswitcher/) - replaces the Music icon on the appswitcher with the now playing album art
* [NowListening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ajPdXcJkjs) - whenever a new song comes on, the track info will display via a notification banner
 
These **DO NOT** work with iOS 6.1 right now, but keep an eye out for them in the future:

* [WeatherIcon](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2010/10/07/weathericon/) - add weather to your status bar and then some 
* [AppSlide](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/06/15/appslide-iphone-back-button/) - makes your home button act more like a back button
* [Ipsum](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/01/07/easily-clear-lock-screen-notifications/) - double-swipe nofications in lock screen to dismiss them (swipe right then back left)
 
I hope some of you find this useful. I'd love to hear about other free and minimal tweaks people have found.

1360090586.0	17y3ju	PSA: Free up space / protect your security delete iMessage residue stored on your device! 	Julio3094	468	24	163	"One of the first things I was able to download when the jailbroke came out was iFile I proceeded to explore some things and quickly noticed something I hadn't seen before. **iOS 6 on my iPhone 5 seems to be saving every single piece of media I've ever sent through iMessage or SMS even if the conversation was deleted.**

Head over to **/Var/mobile/library/SMS/attachments/** and you'll see a bunch of folders inside those folders they'll be more folders and inside this folders there should be the images. I saved 2.7GB of space by delete all of these and definitely got rid for good of pictures I don't want on my device. 

Let me know if you guys notice yours is very full as well and just out of curiosity if there's a way to stop it from being saved. 

Edit: Just an addendum added to this if you don't have or can't install iFile to your phone you can also do this thru SSH my navigating to the same screen. 

Edit Edit: Just wanted to bring attention to what user [justacheesyguy said,]  (http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/17y3ju/psa_free_up_space_protect_your_security_delete/c8a1cff) **it appears all these images are being saved in back ups as well** that being said its best to delete the old back ups and just make a new one after this folders been cleared.  

Other than that i'm glad this has received some attention and has saved you guys some space, I still think its crazy! "	t5_2r8c5	True

**Delete your email accounts and then re-add them. It clears all of the downloaded attachments and messages**

Delete your browser cache ( history, cookies, and data) in Safari or Chrome. Settings - Safari - Clear History + Data and in-app for chrome.


[Go to /var/mobile/Library/Caches/imageCache and delete it](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1dgqv5/i_cleared_nearly_three_gigs_of_space_on_my_iphone/)

**Go to /var/mobile/Media/ApplicationArchives and delete everything in there - it's all the partially downloaded apps**

[Clearing your iFile Trash](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1efa84/just_cleared_26_gigabytes_of_data_with_one_delete/)

[Your album artwork file is huge. I have about 2000 songs and my artwork is at 250mb (See screenshot)](http://i.imgur.com/KSkWrpw.png)


[There are multiple album artworks saved for each song. The only way seen to fix this is to unsync ALL your music then resync it](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/xorcu/multiple_album_arts_for_the_same_album/)

[Check your Downloads folder. If you use iTransmission to download torrents, those are huge and will be in your Other section. There are multiple Downloads folders, so make sure to do a hierarchical search in /var/mobile for Downloads.](http://xsellize.com/topic/193475-how-to-reduce-other-memory/)


If you want to find large files on your iPhone via SSH or in MobileTerminal, you can type the command:

   **""find . -size +100M -print""**

This will list all files larger than 100mb in the current directory you are in. It will also search any subdirectories. I got that hint from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1ettfa/help_tried_to_install_an_app_legit_noncracked/ca4064h)

If you would like a more extensive way of doing this, you can print all files on your device from largest to smallest using [this method.](http://www.johndball.com/2012/05/08/finding-and-removing-large-files-on-iphone/)

What you do, is run the command 
   
   find / -iname “*” -ls | sort -rn -k 7.1 | gawk ‘{print $7,$11}’ &gt; files.txt
   
And it will print all the files in descending size order to a file named ""files.txt"" in your current directory. You must have Gawk installed for thsi to work. 


**If you have lots of themes installed from Cydia, remove those.  I know a lot of the COMPLETE themes can be 80 - 100 mb in size, and if you have 5 of those it will use up all your space. Remove any unused themes**


Go to /var/mobile/Library/Application Support/Containers/eu.heinelt.ifile/Documents/Inbox and check if there is anything you need in there. Delete it. 
In that whole Application Support and Containers folder there is some useless junk. 

**If you have ever used GrooveShark, navigate to /var/mobile/Library/GrooveShark. HOLY COW. Every song and album artwork you have ever downloaded using the app is right there! I just found this. Freed up a ton of space.** 

**Go to /var/mobile/ and do a hierarchical search for Caches. You can delete any folder that comes up - it's just a cache ;)** **Be wary about this though, I don't know 100% of the tweaks that use a Cache folder. Some poorly written tweaks might use it to keep their preferences.**

Go to /var/mobile/Library/DreamBoard. If you uninstall DreamBoard, it sometimes won't remove this folder. If you installed many themes, this folder will be HUGE. 

**Go to /Library (NOT /var/mobile/library, actually just /Library/) and delete the Caches folder, and any folder from a tweak you know you uninstalled. Sometimes tweaks forget to delete their folders ;)**

Some people have had success by going to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage -&gt; Music and then swiping on Music and pressing delete, and then IMMEDIATELY rebooting the phone. I just tried it and it kept all my music but freed up 700 mb of my other section. This isn't guaranteed to work, though, and might actually delete all your music so **do it at your own risk.**



**Needless to say, incase you haven't done it already, pictures taken with the iPhone 4 and newer are enormous - 4 to 5 mb each. If you have 70 pictures in your Camera Roll that can be up to 400mb just in pictures! 5 minutes of hd video will take up a good 200mb. This hint is kind of simple, but sometimes you just forget what you have on there :P**


And now the newest one! I got the information from iFans.


If you have total backup or open backup, their respective backups will be huge. 500 mb huge. 

To clean them, you can just delete /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/OpenBackup

and 

/var/mobile/Documents/TotalBackup

**In addition to these, if you aren't using iCleaner for whatever reason, the Facebook and Alien Blue apps both use HUGE caches. iCleaner will clean these up for you, but just in case you might want to delete them. I know for a fact that FB saves EVERY image you have ever seen in the app in it's caches folder.**


[And, finally, if you have tried ALL of these and none of them work, you can do a ""soft"" restore, and use iLEX RAT to remove everything but keep your jailbreak](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/05/23/how-to-use-ilex-rat/)

Also, one last thing. A lot of tweaks that are installed through Cydia are very messy - they leave a LOT of things behind if you uninstall them. An example of this is iRealSMS. It does a terrible job cleaning up after itself if it uninstalled. All it's Drafts and sms backups are left there. If you use some common sense, you can go through your /var/mobile/ folders and just delete the ones from the tweaks you KNOW you uninstalled.

However, be very cautious with this. Don't go around deleting things willy nilly. Only do this if you know what you're doing. 


As a final note, sometimes there's just nothing you can do. That other section will just stay there because, well, you have lots of other. You installed lots of themes, or a sync went bad or a download got cut short and there is no way you can find to fix it. In that case, if iLex RAT doesn't work, you will have to do a hard restore. 

Please just add a comment on this if you know of any other way to clean up the other section, it would be greatly appreciated!

1362076014.0	19eqm1	[request] Saurik, any chance you could categorize tweaks under sections by popularity?	NaitsirkC	471	39	184	"What I mean is when you go to the sections tab and choose a section, like, say, LockInfo add-ons, the only way to look through all of them is alphabetically, which is great for when you know what you're looking for, but maybe there could also be a way to sort them by popularity/times downloaded (or even 'hot', like the most downloaded for the week), something like that, so I can just go in there and see what the best tweaks are. I wouldn't imagine it'd be too hard to implement, but I don't know much about this stuff. I don't even know if it's actually possible to upgrade Cydia without re-jailbreaking.

Fortunately I was already working on this at the time and showed how far I got. People offered to help beta testing and well... here I you go:
http://www.mediafire.com/?1s7ogx3bt9p45tc

I wrote a pretty detailed explanation, of what it does and how far I got in terms of bugs etc., that you can find here:
http://mkatzmann.blogspot.de/2013/03/jellylock-beta-release.html

Tl;dr:

This is what it does:
http://youtu.be/O0sLSz-Cqk0

Tested on iPhone 5 and 4S both running iOS 6.1 (Should work on iPhone 4 as well.) Not tested on non-retina devices, iPad or any firmware below 6.1.
I couldn't find any issues with JellyLock in combination with LockInfo, Bulletin or SubtleLock. I didn't check compatibility with tweaks like Unfold, Move2Unlock or PaperLock, and I think this would lead to problems.
Also works with HTML lock screens like Alure LS.
EDIT: I just checked compatibility with AndroidLock XT, and it didn't work. Somehow after finishing the unlock gesture the pattern of AndroidLock XT won't come up, which is funny since JellyLock does work with a normal passcode set. I'll be looking into supporting AndroidLock XT though. 

EDIT2: Thanks to /r/jailbreak users we found a few bugs:
- when canceling an emergency call or the passcode entry, the lock is missing
- with some HTML lock screens the lock is missing before first unlock

I'll address them in a future update ;)

Worst thing I can think of, that can happen, is that you get kicked into safe mode. You could unsinstall JellyLock from there via Cydia just like you do with any other tweak.

Known issues:
- the original lock bar becomes visible for a short moment when accessing Siri

Be aware of the following:
Since this changes the way you unlock your device and no software is completely bug free, you should set up an Activator action to unlock your device, if JellyLock fails. (This didn't happen to me and I use it as my daily driver for a week or so, however keep in mind, that this is still a beta. I chose double pressing lock button as said action.) Although I don't think any thing critical will happen, I'm not responsible for any damages caused by JellyLock.

You can customize JellyLock from within Settings.app and also report bugs from there. Changes don't require a respring.

So feel free to comment what you think and have fun with JellyLock! Let there be bugs! :D

(edit #1: The message on this package was changed by the developer to cite ""CydiaStore regulations"", which is also not an accurate appraisal of the situation; at no time was Yllier asked by either myself or SaurikIT, nor was the repository that hosts AdBlocker asked by me to forward a message, for this package's content to be altered in any way.)

So, I was told at some point recently that Yllier (the developer of AdBlocker) left a large red message on his package saying that ""due to Saurik's demand"" some feature had to be removed from the Cydia Store. A ton of people commented on this post, which is now #3 on this subreddit, making various arguments back/forth about what my motivations must have been in this decision.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/18h6hn/what_happened_to_adblocker/

(As an example, some people believed that I would deny this because I make money on ads. Actually, I make no money on ads: all of the ads you see in Cydia are run by third-party repositories. I used to run some ads in the Cydia FAQ, and on a couple of my packages like WinterBoard, but the ad service I used, AdMob for Mobile Web, was actually discontinued a long long time ago, and all of the code for these ads has long since been removed from the few places they existed.)

I have replied to some of the comments now, but as reddit only notifies you when you are directly replied to, and as I wasn't informed about the discussion in time for most of the people who had seen it (which was apparently now over six hours ago) to likely bother to click it again and see my replies, I am posting this self post in the hope that everyone sees it.

Here's the reality: I did not actually demand anything, so the premise is flawed. I was contacted yesterday by BigBoss, asking about a new package that had been submitted to him that was an ad blocker for apps; this product was to be a product for sale using the integrated Cydia Store payment system, and he wanted to know my ""opinion"".

I typed two lines (this is on IRC) in response: 1) ""I don't really want to do that"" &lt;- to me, this is already a hedged statement that indicates that more discussion should occur, and that while I have some reservations, they may not end up being important and it may be done anyway, and 2) ""(though we do already sell adblocker, fwiw)"" &lt;- because, well, we do, and that should be taken into consideration.

To me, this second statement largely undoes any weight that the first one does: it provides a concrete argument for why any initial reservation I might have needs to be examined more closely. To put it again differently: it doesn't even really matter what I ""want"", apparently this has already looked at, ""the ship has sailed"", and now, well: ""we do already sell adblocker"".

BigBoss then explained that AdBlocker had actually recently added this feature. For the record, I always thought that this (block ads in apps) was one of the things that AdBlocker already did, because it just seemed obvious that an ad blocking tool would probably block ads everywhere. Honestly, to the extent to which I think blocking ads is wrong (and I often somewhat do), I don't think blocking them in apps is any different than blocking them on websites: same moral dilemma.

However, the reason BigBoss brought that up seemed to be that this feature had been added to the package even after he (BigBoss) had told the developer that they (the developer) couldn't do that. Now, to explain something for context: I only handle payments, I don't process or host packages, and--while I directly talk with a number of developers on IRC--I don't directly deal with developer *submissions*: developers work with repositories, and repositories work with me.

This means that if you want to have a package sold in Cydia, you first have to convince one of the default repositories to accept your package; they have different beliefs about things sometimes, but they work together (and sometimes tell each other about rejections). If BigBoss hosts your package, though, and he doesn't like it, then his word is law. He can and will pull packages from his repository if he has an issue with them, and inform me after the fact. (I think this is fine.)

So I can understand why BigBoss would have been somewhat upset about the situation, and he and a few other people got into a conversation about the package. I did not say anything about this situation, though; I was busy with other things, and it didn't seem to involve me. The only contribution I had to the overall discussion past this point is a typically-saurik pedantic what-if regarding a joke someone made.

(Specifically, someone--who shall remain nameless, but is neither a repository maintainer nor affiliated with SaurikIT--suggested putting large quantities of ads on the new package as a cute ""punishment"". I then suggested, in a semi-humorous and overly-long way, that that might actually increase sales of the product, as it demonstrates the pain of how horrible ads can be at the point of decision.)

That is the last I heard of the situation. What I figured would happen at this point is that BigBoss would make a decision regarding the new package (whether or not he wants to host it), and after that I would receive via the normal process that we have in place a package submission that I could either accept or reject after giving it some thought and hearing the whole story.

However, what actually ended up happening is that this other package, AdBlocker, that we already sell (and which my only commentary on was ""though we do already sell adblocker, fwiw"", remember), has apparently made some changes and in relation put a massive note on their package saying I demanded some technical change to their product because that functionality had to be removed.

Well, that sucks: I didn't demand anything of AdBlocker, and I didn't even make a decision on that new package yet (and to the extent that I said anything, I kind of hedged in both directions); all I did was provide a first-blush opinion when informally asked about that unrelated package. I am not even 100% certain what all this feature *does*... I certainly did not demand that it be *removed*.

""cool jailbreak tweaks for iphone"" I'll start the list with a list of tweaks I've been writing in my iPhone's notepad ever since I updated to iOS 6:
(please make sure that the tweaks are iOS 6 compatible first by checking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsxLituOoyr9dGRaMk1YSWxYMk9RWmU3UHBwVWFVYkE&amp;pli=1#gid=0))
Also, I am aware that the sidebar has recommended tweaks, but I just thought we could make a big list as a community to pass the time.

1: Fakeclockup: Speeds up animations on your phone to make it seem faster (In my experience actually lets me get things done slightly faster)

2: CameraTweak: Cool mod for the stock camera app that lets you do so much more.

3: My3g: Tricks apps into thinking that they are on 3g, unlocking a lot of potential (download apps &gt; 50mb, facetime over 3g, etc)

4: Dashboard x: Lets you place notification center widgets on the home screen

5: Ncsettings: Basically a wattered down version of sbsettings as a notification center widget. Also, iPhone users with gsm carriers can use it to disable 3G and save battery life.

6: Nitrous: Allows other apps to use safari's nitro webkit thingy (speeds up web browsing in other internet apps, such as chrome and alien blue)

7: WeeTrackData: Notification center widget to track your data usage. (currently not working on iOS 6)

8: iFile: File system access for your iPhone

I've also been told by many people to get BiteSMS, so this will be my first time using it :)

In addition to getting these wonderful apps from Cydia, I will also be:

1: Removing Launch Daemons: Delete iPhone processes that you don't use (such as crash reporters, OTA updaters, spotlight search, etc) to free up ram, speed up the phone, and DRASTICALLY speed up boot time, which is important because the untethered jailbreak lets us boot any time we want :)

2: Deleting stock apps: Self explanatory, saves space on my springboard

What will you guys be doing to your devices once this Jailbreak drops?

EDIT 1: Double spacing stuff for better formatting

Edit 2: I forgot to mention that you can use ncsettings to disable 3G on gsm carriers to use edge, and therefore save battery (won't be practical in a few years, use it while you can)"	t5_2r8c5	True

In order to reduce the number of repetitive posts, here's what you should do:

* When 6.1 is publicly released, **DO NOT UPGRADE TO IT IMMEDIATELY**. Stay on your current iOS version and wait until Team Evad3rs releases their public jailbreak to update. The only reason you should be upgrading right away is if 6.1 fixes a major bug you've been having, or you somehow irreversibly mess your iDevice up and need to upgrade.
* **Remember to use TinyUmbrella to save your SHSH blobs.** The sidebar has a guide on how to do it. If you're on iOS 5, you will be able to save iOS 6 blobs. If you've got an A5+ device, you can also save blobs without being jailbroken. (Redsn0w can also save blobs for those on 6.0.2. - /u/theCarryAll)
* **Be sure to update to 6.1 only via iTunes, not OTA.** If you do an OTA update, it'll hurt your chances of being able to downgrade or upgrade via blobs, and other useful jailbreak tools (which I can't think of right now) (thanks to /u/HoshiKaze)
* **Don't download anything that isn't linked to by a reputable source:** @Evad3rs twitter, something upvoted on this subreddit, or jailbrea.kr. It is easy to fake a reputable site, so stick to those sources. - /u/Stabulousity
* **If you're currently jailbroken, make a list of all of your installed tweaks.** AptBackup, PkgBackup, AppInfo, a word processor, and a pen or pencil can do this for you. (screenshots too - /u/New_Post_Evaluator)
* **Do not donate money to anyone right now.** Team Evad3rs and the other devs will not ask for your money, anyone who does is not official. After the jailbreak comes out, the donation status may change. (thanks to /u/zmist)
* beetling's awesome [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/17dq3p/psa_with_the_jailbreak_coming_out_soon_heres_what/c84l138)

**SHSH Blobs and you**

Should you ever want to downgrade or re-restore to an iOS version and you've missed the signing window from Apple, you're basically fucked. **UNLESS** you have your handy dandy SHSH blobs saved. There's no guarantee you'll be able to downgrade (ie A5 devices on iOS 6), but if you can, you'll need the blobs. You'll also be able to re-restore to an iOS version when the shift-click-restore doesn't work anymore. SHSH blobs are also unique to each device, so you won't be able to share them with other devices.


**Regarding iOS 6.0.2**

Apparently people aren't aware that it's only available for the iPhone 5 and iPad mini. The highest firmware every other device that has iOS 6 can be right now is 6.0.1.

Grab : [LockscreenLineFix.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?quqky0mn88cgkvi)

Unzip and place this UINavigationBarShadow%@2x.png into the /your.theme/UIImages folder to remove the thin grey bar on the lockscreen if you've hidden the slider.

The downside is it removes shadows from *all* navigation bars (such as under address bar in safari, messages, and the status bar) so everything else looks a bit ""flatter"".

There is also a [shared@2x.artwork](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?zvn2awaof7u62zk) for (iPhone 4 / 6.1) non-winterboard themers [available here](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?zvn2awaof7u62zk)

Thanks again to the evad3rs team !

Edit : ~~If someone wants to send this to cydia or whatever, go ahead. icbf since I don't use winterboard.~~

A few kind folks have sent this to be included in cydia, will post the filenames here as they become live.

Evening All,

Due to the amount of fragmented threads on the front page at the moment I've decided to create a megathread. There is some debate on whether these guys are trolls or not, however I will remain impartial on this thread and keep updating. Feel free to comment, and upvote for visibility.


Twitter: [here](https://twitter.com/UnthreadedJB)

Website: [right here](http://unthreadedjb.com/)


**Where we are as of the start of the thread:**

Right now there is a Linux download available on the Unthreaded website. This is for the iOS 5.1 CDMA which has not been exploited before. This is big news as it shows they have some skill. Unthreaded have promised a 6.1.3/6.1.4 jailbreak by the end of tonight, which is a massive promise. Theories have been flying that this could be another, well known developer under an alias.

*This is all we know right now, we are awaiting information but they have semi proved themselves with the iOS 5.1 jailbreak. Linux instructions below as a preemptive measure*

**UPDATE: Site changed back to old spelling. Something, an iso, has dropped. Trying to see what it is for you now...**

**UPDATE: Looking at this, it seems like the jailbreak will jailbreak (probably all) devices lower, than, or equal to, iPhone 4, ranging from iOS 4.3.4 to iOS 5.1.1** via /u/Malvix_

iPhone 5 ""proof"": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLju21ZFwGc - Video could be faked, see how [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1jbmuh/unthreaded_jailbreak_megathread/cbd8h7h)

/u/ryley_angus with iPhone 5 Global 6.1.4:
**Device is a N42AP with build 10B350 Error Device is not supported**

Jailbreak for 6.1.3 &amp; 6.1.4 has **NOT** dropped yet.

Anyone brave enough to try the .iso on the website should boot into Linux, download the .iso and extract it. Run the extracted UNTHREAD file in the terminal. I've put what I could find in the file in a comment below. 

The .iso **IS NOT A DISK IMAGE** and for the love of the chipmunk lords do not try to boot with it. It's an archive, like a zip/rar/etc

-------------
**OS Required**

As you can see from what's on the Unthreaded site, Linux is required for the moment, they may release Windows programs in time. If they release a 6.1.3/4 jailbreak it will likely be the same so these instructions are here just in case you haven't used Linux before.

I would not recommend a VM (Virtual Machine) for this since you will need to communicate over USB and it can screw up in a VM. Instead use [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/) then plug your iPhone into another USB port. 

**Instructions for Unetbootin**

First plug a memory stick into Windows and launch Unetbootin, then the recommended Linux distribution is Ubuntu (12.04 Live) which you can select on step one of Unetbootin [picture here](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/unetbootin/raw-attachment/wiki/MiscWikiFiles/unetbootin-windows7.png) - then select your USB stick and hit ""OK"".

**BIOS Instructions**

Some BIOS's may boot from the hard disk first. When your computer boots you should see a few options on the first screen before the first Windows logo. One of these may be ""Boot Order"" or ""Boot Device"" - if this doesn't exist F2/Delete is usually setup where you can set your boot order so USB comes first. It should tell you quite clearly which button enters setup if it is neither of these.

From /u/pseudolobster - ""it's usually esc, F8, or F12, Esc for HP/Compaq laptops, F8 for a lot of desktops, particularly ones with ASUS motherboards, F12 for dell laptops. Again though, it should say somewhere, ""press [whatever] for boot selection menu"" or similar."""	t5_2r8c5	True

While this won't stop your phone from being stolen in the first place, it can help the police track it, or cause the thief to ditch it somewhere.

1: Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Restrictions, and disallow changes to location services. That way, a thief can't disable location services, meaning you can still track the phone.

2: Disallow changes to accounts in restrictions. Now they can't log out of your icloud account and turn off ""find my iPhone""

3: Using activator, make a ""short hold"" on the power button respring the phone. Now they can't turn it off in the conventional way. I'd highly recommend setting an alternate action to turn it off, or setting up NCSettings or something to do so.

While this isn't 100% foolproof, it'll give your phone a slightly above average level of security. If you have any additional tips, share them in the comments."	t5_2r8c5	True

I've been lurking /r/jailbreak since the evasi0n jailbreak was released, so I thought it was about time I contributed something.


Here's a list of my current jailbreak tweaks on my iPhone 5 iOS 6.1:

*(tweaks with no price next to them are free)*

* **f.lux** - Adjusts screen colour temperature based on time of day to make it easier on the eyes

* **SBSettings** - Adds a menu with toggles like wifi, brightness, data, location, etc

* **Infinifolders** [$1.99] - Allows you to put as many apps as you want in folders

* **Zephyr** [$2.99] - Access app switcher and switch apps with gestures instead of home button

* **Winterboard** - Themes and UI modifications

* **Barrel** [$2.99] - Lets you select a different animation when going through the pages on springboard

* **BlurriedNCBackground** - Gives the notification center a blurred translucent background

* **FakeClockUp** - Lets you speed up the animations so it seems like your phone is faster

* **Browser Changer** - Lets you change the default browser from Safari to another one you've downloaded

* **Bars** - Adds half/quarter bars on the reception indicator

* **Auxo** [$1.99] - Improves the app switcher; makes it look very nice and adds swipe gestures to close apps instead of having to hold your finger down on them. Also adds stuff on the other pages of the switcher to the left

* **Nitrous** [$0.99] - Changes the javascript engine to the Nitro javascript engine for much faster page load times

* **Octopus Keyboard** [$4.99] - Adds the functionality of the new Blackberry Z10's much-hyped keyboard

* **iCaughtU** - Emails the current address of the phone and a photo of the person that tries to unlock your phone with an incorrect passcode

* **SpringFlash** - Lets you turn on the flashlight of the phone by double-pressing the lock button

* **Zeppelin** - Lets you add a small logo in place of the carrier name

* **Bytafont** - Lets you change the font of the phone

* **Bulletin** [$0.99] - Lets you access the Notification Center from the lockscreen

* **SpotiPlay** - Makes Spotify the default music player

* **iFile** [$4.00 / Free Trial] - Lets you access the phone's filesystem

* **SwipeShiftCaret** - Lets you move your little cursor when editing text with simple swipes

* **Cyntact** [$1.00] / **Copic** [$1.49] - Adds the contact's photo next to their name on the Contacts list. *EDIT: Copic is a great alternative to Cyntact which I've just switched to. It does the same thing but the look is a bit cleaner and it also adds photos to the lock screen, mail, messages and notification center. Credit to _phi for suggesting it in the comments*

* **StatusTab** - Shows status bar when you're pulling down the notification center in fullscreen apps instead of that little gripper thing

* **DismissMyKeyboard** - Allows you to dismiss a pesky keyboard that won't go away by swiping right on the spacebar

* **IconRenamer** - Have a guess

* **AdBlocker** [$2.19] - Have another guess

* **Dater** [$0.99] - Shows the date and time that each photo was taken in your Photos


Here are some that were very useful for me before but I haven't been able to find working for iOS 6.1:

*(if anyone knows any working alternatives, it would be much appreciated)*

* **TimeSpeak** - Adds a 'thing' to Activator that speaks the time when activated (e.g. hold down headset mic button and it tells you the time). Useful when phone is in pocket or armband and you want to know the time through your headphones

* **LowPowerBanner** - Replaces the annoying low battery popup with a notification banner. *EDIT: Comments are saying that this works on the 4S, but not on the 5*

* **Apptivator** - Adds a listener to Activator that lets you do things based on tapping/holding/swiping app icons (e.g. double tap Camera app icon to open Photos)


Which useful jailbreak apps have you guys installed?"	t5_2r8c5	True
1367685591.0	1donbv	Thank you	SuitAndPie	342	68	81	"So today I did it, I did the unthinkable. I converted to Android. I bought a Nexus 4 and I have to say I love it. Though, no matter how good this phone is, it will leave a void in me. I'm going to miss the dozens upon dozens of tweaks I had installed on my iPhone 5, i'm going to miss browsing Reddit for new tweaks/themes, hell i'm even going to miss the occasional springboard crash here and there. 


I just want to take this chance to thank the /r/jailbreak community and all the support that they have given me. This (and /r/iOSthemes) have been my favourite subreddits for a while. Not purely because of the content thats posted, but also because of the community that looks out for one another, that helps find solutions to problems, and helps reinvent iOS. 

Whether you are a typical user, a fulltime developer, or anything in between, you are all the lifeblood of the jailbreak community. Without this subreddit who knows how dull Cydia could be right now. 

Now i've had a few drinks and have a bit of a buzz on so this may sound deeper to me than it actually is, but this community really is a special one. The users here are constantly coming up with good ideas, and other users are constantly making those ideas a reality. 

I'm sure that I will continue to check this subreddit occasionally, however I wouldn't feel comfortable contributing without a jailbroken iOS device. So I just want to say keep up the amazing work guys. This truly is an amazing subreddit.

And again, thank you for making my iOS experience a great one.

I probably made a typo or mistake somewhere, please let me know so I can fix it!

Quick question: Do we need to have an ""Our Favorite Tweaks of All Time"" post? I'm worried this will just be incredibly redundant, since there's a lot of threads like this that already. I'm considering scrapping it and just going with a yearly ""Best tweaks released in 20xx"" instead.

Also, sometime next week (maybe Thursday/Friday), we will also have our first poll! Here's the [post](http://redd.it/1ag8x0) talking about it. I'm thinking it'll be a bimonthly thing, probably on the 1st and 3rd week of the month. If you'd like to suggest a question for a poll, feel free to PM me, or one of my self-posts.

1366626281.0	1cutpe	Suggestion to jail-breakers: Everyone with non-downgrade-able devices, you should install ILEX R.A.T	irrational_abbztract	278	29	164	"OFFICIAL iLEX Post by /u/iLEXinfo is now up:
http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1cwcd2/ilex_rat_the_official_reddit_page/

Please head over there any difficulty you may be having with iLEX R.A.T

What is iLEX R.A.T?

iLEX R.A.T (Remove All Tweaks) is a tweak/script for MobileTerminal someone came up with. If you install it and have MobileTerminal installed, running the command that is installed by the tweak will start a process which removes EVERYTHING that was installed after jail-breaking. This includes all tweaks and themes and also all their settings files (in rare cases, some settings files get left behind.) This is basically like restoring your device to the state it was in after it was first jailbroken. AFAIK, it doesn't touch your App Store apps and your device remains jailbroken.

Here's the first post made on /r/jailbreak regarding the tweak.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1byge1/has_anyone_seen_this_ilex_rat_removes_all_files/

Not trying to promote or advertise it. My thought process for making this suggestion was as follows:

As per title, you have an iOS device which cannot be downgraded to an older iOS. Let's say you messed up by installing something from Cydia and now your only option is to restore and update to iOS 6.1.3

What is the probability of you being able to salvage your device and the jailbreak? Nil. 

The reason I suggest for everyone to install is that several members of this subreddit have said they have used iLEX R.A.T and it has saved their devices. 

Here's a post I made to ask those who have used iLEX to report back on their experience.

http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1cuu1n/have_you_used_ilex_rat_how_was_your_experience/

Installing iLEX R.A.T at least gives you a *chance* of being able to save your device.

I installed iLEX R.A.T this morning because I was about to install TCP Optimizer and worried about potentially effing up my phone. 

If I didn't install it, I would have had no chance to save my phone because its not possible to restore but not to update. Chances of me being able to keep my phone jailbroken after restoring and updating? 0. 

iLEX R.A.T might not save your device but at least it gives you a chance to try. It gives you a 50% chance that you can save your phone. 

TL;DR : Install iLEX R.A.T because it may save your phone should you mess up your not-downgradeable device.


Repo: http://cydia.myrepospace.com/iLEXiNFO/ (new official repo)

Make sure to install MobileTerminal too.
Alternatively, you could use a PC program like iFunBox to run the command. This is logically a much better way since iLEX will also uninstall MobileTerminal and thus may cause SpringBoard crashes or other problems. Alternatives to iFunBox include PuTTY and WinSCP (as suggested by /u/Revoluti0nary. Thanks, mate.)

Install iLEX R.A.T (ENG) for the English one. 
Install iLEX R.A.T (RUS) for the Russian one.

Edit: 

Added link to post with user reviews of iLEX R.A.T

Changed ""ILEX"" to *iLEX* to get rid of confusion about the name. *iLEX R.A.T* is the name

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/144vaz/jailbreak_redmond_pie_progress_alert_list_is_this/) by /u/bottledLighting prompted me to think if there was a way to get an instant alert when the iOS 6 jailbreak is out. And there is!

Just head over to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and make an account. Link your email and phone number (if you have texting). After you're ready to go, use this [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/68488) I just made. It'll send you an email when the Dev Team posts a new article to their blog. Alternatively, you can use this [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/68490) which will send you a text.

This is more for people (which I believe is most) who have lives (I don't) and don't have all the time in the world to constantly browse /r/jailbreak, and jailbreak related sites. It's also for people who would just love to have something like this.

If you're not already using IFTTT, why aren't you? Seriously. It's awesome.

This post will also be linked to in the sidebar, for your future viewing pleasure.

I still have my iPad mini jailbroken, while my iPhone 5 is freshly updated to iOS 7. Yes, there are bugs, but when I look at iOS 6 running on my iPad, it just looks and feels dated. Auxo for iPad (an amazing tweak, don't get me wrong), looks almost antiquated compared to the multitasking iOS 7 now offers (of course, this, and many other features were taken from the jailbreak community and I am grateful for you guys being able to provide Apple with a framework for actually implementing some of my favourite tweaks). At first, like many of you, I hated the icons. I'm getting used to them and, along with the refreshed interface across the board, iOS 7 blows my iOS 6.1 jailbreak out of the water. Of course, this is just my opinion and I will admit that I will probably miss some very quality upcoming tweaks, but for now iOS 7&gt;jailbreak.

1339900491.0	v5w9u	A Jailbreak Story. 	LouSkyWaka	257	27	28	"Hey guys. Usually I see tweaks and themes on r/jailbreak. I find these posts awesome and informative.  However, this isn't a post about that. 

Recently, my mother moved to South Carolina. She had spent the first 50 years of her life here in Alabama, about 10 minutes away from my grandparents. The move was especially hard on her and my grandmother, who were very close. This weekend I am up visiting my grandfather for father's day and had an idea. How awesome would it be for them to FaceTime each other?! Alas, my grandparents do not own a computer thus do not have Internet. 

And here comes Jailbreaking to save the day. I have used 3G unrestrictor (still have unlimited data) since my first iPhone 4 jailbreak. So I got my mom connected and brought the phone into the living room to my grandmother. They both instantly started crying and saying how much they missed each other. They talked for almost an hour. 

As they sat there, I sat back and just thought what an amazing piece of hardware the iPhone is. And Jailbreaking took it just that much further. 

I'd like to thank this community for its support and ideas for Jailbreaking. You guys (and girls) rock. "	t5_2r8c5	True

I know, I have a lot of the generic tweaks, but I think there's a few hidden gems in here.

Themes
---

Last month was the first month I included themes in the round up. With the creation of our new subreddit /r/iOSthemes (check it out if you haven't!), a separate theme round up will be posted there. This month's round up will be several days late since it's taking so damn long.

Tweak Updates
---

/u/Christodouluke requested last month that I include tweak updates in roundups. I replied saying that I would, but I've since decided not to. Shortly after the release of the Evasi0n jailbreak, I learned about an awesome website called [CydiaUpdates](http://cydiaupdates.net/) that is a feed of every new and updated tweak and app (no themes) released to the default repos. They also have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/cydiaupdates) account. The feed updates every time the default repos push new or updated tweaks and apps, so you'll get them as they come.

---

As always, if there's something I got wrong, missed, or you think is worth including, just let me know!

I don't even know if anyone remembers or cares, but I've been promising that we'd have a best tweaks poll for a while now. I've been incredibly busy with school work, club activities, and moderating the new subreddit, and I apologize. The poll will have to be pushed back even more, and I'll do my best to get working on it after my finals when I'm on Spring break (last week of March).

**Edit:** Shameless plug - check out my [giveaway](http://redd.it/19gg16) on /r/RandomActsOfGaming! I get nothing from it other than the joy of giving people games! It'll end sometime Saturday afternoon (PST).

[Jailbreak Nation](http://www.jailbreaknation.com/) posted this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5oIWbMY80&amp;amp;amp;feature=player_embedded) today highlighting three of the best tweaks in their opinion that came out this month:

* **Monocle** (Free) - Full screen mode for all apps
* **Speero** ($0.99) - System management tool (iPad Only)
* **Aicon** ($1.99) - Adds photo effects to icons

---

Some other tweaks that came out this month:

* **Ayecon for iPad** ($2.99, $1.99 if you have the iPhone version) - Not a tweak, but the incredibly popular theme makes its way onto the iPad!
* **Chrome Download Manager** ($3.00) - Safari download manager except for Chrome
* **Chromizer** (Free) - Adds full screen mode, pull to refresh, and iPhone tab switching to iPads
* **CoverMeNot** (Free) - When a notification banner pops up, it moves the entire screen down instead of covering the screen
* **Dashboard X 2.0** ($1.99) - Not a new tweak, but an update to the already amazing Dashboard X. This one allows you to resize widgets, and a key feature for iPad users: saves location for both portrait and landscape orientation
* **FoldMusic** ($1.50) - Puts music playlists in folders on your homescreen
* **Grafiti** ($0.99) - Gives you a drawing pad as one of the keyboards
* **MultiStorey** (Free) - Doubles the size of the app switcher
* **Nitrous** ($0.99) - Enables the Nitrous engine for a lot of apps. Makes things much faster.
* [**Octopus Keyboard**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjpUNe9Nbww&amp;amp;amp;feature=plcp) ($4.99) - Mimics the blackberry keyboard, allows for faster typing. This really needs a video (linked) to show how powerful and absolutely awesome this tweak is.
* **Quick Reply for Messenger** ($1.99)
* **PreviewMaker** ($1.99) - Allows you to create screenshots with the iPhone around it like [this](http://www.surenix.me/ayecon/iphone/)

Personally, I think the Jailbreak Nation video really dropped the ball, and they could have highlighted some really awesome tweaks. Personally for me, I really enjoy Chromizer and Nitrous. I did pick up FoldMusic, but as of right now it doesn't have the features I want, so I uninstalled it. I would have bought Octopus Keyboard if it wasn't as expensive.

What tweaks did you guys like? Which ones didn't you like? Any that I didn't list here that you really enjoyed using?

Also, please give me feed back. Do you like this kind of post? Is there anything I could have done to make it better?

If you don't like this post, please speak up too. I'd rather hear all ideas than get only one side or none at all.

Windows puts active applications in memory until hey are no longer active or you run out of memory, in which case it goes to a swap file. iOS  keeps as many things as possible in memory for quick loading times.

1375572022.0	1jngfr	Jailbreak Scams	Synchronizing	237	25	41	"Jailbreak scams have been around since the inception of jailbreaking itself. The very fact someone can make several hundred dollars selling something that is completely free baffles me. Truly though, what impresses me the most is the fact that people will actually buy it. This is a quick post regarding /u/CdnDude boss [paying $50 for a jailbreak](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1jn8ef/so_my_boss_just_used_this_website_to_try_and/) on a website called [TheJailbreakShop.com](http://thejailbreakshop.com/). 

After snooping around the comments I decided to go along and buy the ""product"" and see what it was all about. I followed /u/its_not_herpes suggestion to [attempt to purchase it at $0.01](http://i.imgur.com/j2kN026.png) and was rather impressed at the results.

It worked perfectly fine. Now, it worked not because of some PayPal glitch, but rather the fact that they truly suck at making a proper payout (/u/dudeedud4 uncovered the [plugin they use is exploitable](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1jngfr/jailbreak_scams/cbgi6to)). [I paid the $0.01 cents](http://i.imgur.com/5tx1eUCh.png) and got redirected to a [error page](http://i.imgur.com/mCFI1QUh.png) thinking that that was the end of it -- they would jack your money and tell you there was some error within their system. It seems not, seconds later I received an email saying my [membership had been approved](http://i.imgur.com/ICeTzpS.png) and I was ready to get started. 

Clicking the TinyUrl link I got [redirected to a standard WordPress register page](http://i.imgur.com/heHJNDSh.png) ~~(you can actually register yourself as though you bought it [here](http://thejailbreakshop.com/wp-login.php?action=register))~~, in which after registering [received an email with my password](http://i.imgur.com/rClLVHo.png), and username. 

Now, this is my first experience with any sort of scam site and I was rather impressed at how organized it all was; the [homepage looked clean](http://i.imgur.com/OlD9zvSh.png) for such scam, and at this stage I was quite pleased with my progress.  I went ahead and [downloaded ""their"" program](http://i.imgur.com/CtgIgvhh.png) to be unimpressed of it being [evasi0n](http://i.imgur.com/JpEAJwe.png), but rather shocked at the fact they [did not even bother to edit the changelog.txt or README.txt](http://i.imgur.com/FdtzbZl.png). 

The whole situation is quite ironic and anyone who has felt for such before: watch-out next time. All these sites are **complete** scams, whether they are iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6, they will always be crap unless said otherwise by one of the devs.

1326387006.0	oe2n1	Why we can never give ETAs for jailbreaks.	planetbeing	239	24	43	"The problem with giving any definite ETAs is that there can always be problems that crop up that blindside us that will take an unknown amount of time to solve (if they are even solvable). Let me give you a little timeline about this sandbox issue, for example (though I have to avoid giving currently classified technical details ;)).

Generally, constructing jailbreaks takes a lot of time researching issues: how, conceptually, are we going to break Apple's protections and mitigations against it. Then, to figure out what precise techniques will we use to implement our ideas. Those take an unknown amount time and may actually be impossible. It is *theoretically* possible for Apple, if they don't make any mistakes, to create a system that prevents jailbreaking. Then, after those are figured out, time can be spent coding the jailbreak, which takes a more predictable amount of engineering time. Unfortunately, sometimes while coding, you happen to discover the method you thought would theoretically work, even a method you tested before, might have unforeseen difficulties because you made some incorrect assumptions.

When we're at the research stage, we can't give an ETA because we don't even know if it's going to be possible. When we're at the engineering stage, we can't give an ETA because heaven forbid we find that we've made a mistaken assumption and need to go back to the research stage.

I started to actively participate on January 6th, and I thought I could contribute by helping to figure out the sandbox issues since that's the one thing that needed to be researched at that point. The following five days has been one of the more irritating weeks of my life. On day 1, pod2g and I both independently came up with a way to circumvent the sandbox that would've been nice and simple. Unfortunately, later that day we discovered we misread the sandbox profile and it would not be possible. The next day was spent trying to see if any clever variation of the first idea could get around the sandbox: no.  Then we were messing around and found a small vulnerability in the sandbox, a one millimeter hole in a huge wall if you will, and it seemed like it could be weaponized to get around the sandbox so we can break out. Eventually, I came up with the plan that formed the basis of what we have right now, but it needed three different pieces to make work. I managed to furnish the first piece myself pretty quickly, but the other two were not forthcoming. The next few days were filled with brilliant ideas by brilliant people that would work *if only such-and-such were true*. Every day, it was two steps forward and one step back. Then pod2g made a suggestion on how the second piece could be obtained and saurik managed to find it fairly quickly going off his suggestion. The day before, we thought we had finally gotten it: The idea had gotten past basic testing, so we made a few tweets on progress. Then later we found out, crushingly, that there was a weird behavior that prevented our method from working in practice. The next day was us scrambling to figure out a variation of the idea that would work, which required finding other candidates for the idea's prerequisites. saurik managed to figure some stuff out that gave us a little more invaluable wiggle room in finding the prerequisites and I managed to find something that would work. I created a proof of concept and it worked!

The result is basically building a program that aims a tiny bullet to shoot out of the one millimeter hole in our sandbox, having it bounce off of a few different surfaces (that we were lucky to find) to adjust our aim and have it go down the exhaust port of the Death Star, and instead of blowing it up, bounce off a few more surfaces inside the Death Star to get to the control room, and have the bullet bounce off buttons and levers to aim the Death Star at the sandbox wall to blow it up.

We don't think there's any more issues and we are starting to engineer it, but we don't really want to say we don't think there's any more issues because one or more might crop up. So basically, we've had really significant progress, but we can't give an ETA."	t5_2r8c5	True

I'm Karen (angelXwind), that person who sinks into hiding holes on this subreddit, and runs her own repo at http://cydia.angelxwind.net/ .

If you installed Ingress, PPSSPP, and/or nds4ios, you have my repo added (or a certain piracy repo that mirrors my packages...)

Recently, I updated the versioning scheme used on my repo to a format compliant with the new dpkg update, which now requires that the version string begins with a number.

This, as a result, has broken updates to some of my Cydia packages for a number of people.

It's easy to fix, simply remove the package, then reinstall it.

**How do you tell if it's broken?**

Cydia will mark the package as being from ""Unknown / Local"" and there will be no Modify button, only a Remove button.

Simply remove and install, and it'll fix itself.

These packages are known to be affected:

* PPSSPP (Stable)
* PPSSPP (Testing)
* Ingress (Testing)
* nds4ios (Stable)
* nds4ios (Testing)
* nds4ios (iOS 5)
* iSwipe
* Cydiaの日本語化
* Cydia的简体中文版
* Cydia的繁體中文版
* Even if it is not listed here, check anyway.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, it was an unexpected consequence of updating the version scheme.

1367424393.0	1dhkkc	I think ModMyI.com ripped off my jailbreak tweak. Is this common?	arthurrrrrrr	237	37	28	"So, I made an iOS jailbreak tweak called LSMusicSeek and submitted it to ModMyI.com for inclusion in Cydia a few days ago. Basically it replaces the volume slider on the lock screen with a seek slider, so you can seek through your music on the lock screen.

I then noticed an announcement for a new tweak called LSScrubbing, which does pretty much  exactly the same thing. But it costs $1.99.

Mine was submitted as a free tweak, but it seems that the ""control"" file of the .deb package was altered. Originally, my tweak depended on MobileSubstrate. In Cydia, my tweak now depends on Winterboard, and is now categorized as a Winterboard theme. But it's not a Winterboard theme, it is a MobileSubstrate tweak. I don't see how this happens by accident.

Is this a common occurrance in the jailbreaking community? I'm new to jailbreaking, this is my first (and probably last) attempt at a tweak.

In any case, I'm releasing the source code on github at https://github.com/arthurrr/LSMusicSeek.git

* Activator (free) – please.

* AdBlockerNetworks (free) *repo.yllier.net* - partially functional ad blocker

* Animate (free) – if you want to add an animated bootlogo, you need this

* AnyRing (3.99) – custom setting of ringtones from any song, useful, but I purchased this at a younger age.  Probably wouldn’t get it now, but no reason not to download it. **update** since people still seem to be seeing this, the latest Anyring update caused my phone to crash on unlock every time, had to remove in safe mode. Not sure if it's a conflict or a bad tweak, but there have been other similar reports

* AppInfo (free) – get an easy list of all installed apps and/or Cydia packages

* Appstore Update Size (free) – lists the size of updates… who’da thunk?

* AptBackup (free) – for backing up packages. I haven’t used it yet so I can’t attest to its reliability

* Auxo (2.99) beta: *repo.A3tweaks.com* - We all know this little fucker.  I have a love/hate relationship with it though on my weak 4S **update** I am redacting this part of my post. Auxo is a bug-ridden mess, not designed to run on a 4S. Because with Zephyr and BDP I barely used it, I have since removed it and replaced it with swipeaway. My battery life improved by a few hours as a result

* BatteryDoctor Pro (free) – not only an app to manage your battery but a great set of toggles with customizable settings profiles. No issues on the 4S, but I don’t have LTE (obviously) which is where most of the complaints come from

* Bars (free) – more precise signal bars.  Because why not?

* Blackout (free) – gives you a black statusbar while in apps, regardless of your theme.  Useful if you have a clear statusbar in your theme

* Bolt (free) – removes the obtrusive battery, leaving only the percent (and a single lightning bolt, if charging)

* Boover (free) – lets you adjust the size and position of your app badges. There’s no rules!

* BrowserChanger (free) – replace your default browser with one of your choosing (currently I use chrome, and safari for downloads)

* BytaFont (free) – download and change your system font (affects almost everything.  I suggest Questrial)

* Callbar (3.99) – one of my favorites, makes calling unobtrusive and amazingly quick and easy.  How I think calling should have been in iOS.  Worth every penny.

* ClearNotifications (free) *not on repo* - Makes your LS notifications clear (just the bubble, not the stack. See NoLockNotificationsBG for this). Technically speaking, this is on a repo.  However, the guy who randomly volunteered to put it up also fills his myrepospace with pirated apps, so I refuse to post the link.  The download can be found on [this reddit post.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/18p9tw/clearhighnotifications_lock_screen_theme_for/) Note: if you *really* wanted the repo version, it’s in the first set of comments there. **see** NoLockNotificationsBG

* CleverPin (1.99) – Passcode only comes up when not connected to your home WiFi (you specify what that is).  The free version would be AutoProtectiOS, but I found that caused occasional crashes and had a slight memory leak

* ColorKeyboard (1.99) – theme your keyboard from one of many themes (more downloadable)

* ContactPrivacy (free) – prompts you when any app wants to access your contacts

* Crash Reporter (free) – gives detailed crash reports when any app (or the springboard) fails. Occasionally can determine the cause by itself.  Make sure to get syslogd or one of the other suggested crashlog readers

* Curiosa (free) – Periodically checks for Cydia updates and notifies you, so you don’t have to open the app to check regularly

* Cyntact (.99) – puts contact photos by their name in your phone list

* Cyueue (2.49) – all the rage lately, adds queue functionality to the default music.app

* Dashboard X (?.??) – bought it so long ago, I don’t remember the price. Allows placement of NC widgets like weesearch or the weather on your Springboard (i.e. the icon screen, for the uneducated)

* Delete Word (free) – Press Shift+Delete to delete a whole word

* DietBulletin (free) – shrink your push notifications to one of three options.  I have mine set to look like they’re in the statusbar.  If you like it, you may also like DietBar; I don’t

* DismissMyKeyboard (free) – remove the keyboard from anywhere simply by swiping from spacebar to return key.  I use it all the time

* F.lux (free) – if you don’t know what this is, you’ll hear about it shortly.  Warms your screen colors at night to go easy on the eyes

* FlagPaint Lite (free) – colors your notification banners to match the app they’re from.  The paid version has a few more features

* FolderEnhancer (2.49) – remakes the iOS folders; allows for iconoclasm layouts to be used inside folders; unlimited folder space with vertical or horizontal pages; folders inside folders inside folders, etc.  There’s no rules!

* gameboy4iphone (free) – ZodTTD’s Gameboy/Gameboy Color emulator, I use it to play my old pokemon games

* GBA.emu (4.50) – Robert Broglia’s Gameboy Advance emulator, it’s a little weird to purchase right now because his paypal is down. I also use it to play pokemon, and one or two other old games

* Gridlock 2.0 (4.99 new, 1.99 upgrade) – lets you place your icons anywhere in a layout, even with spaces in between.  Works with iconoclasm and folderenhancer (although I get the occasional glitch, maybe once a week)

* iCaughtU (free, 2.50 pro) – free version gives basic protection by emailing location and photo after a certain number of wrong attempts.  Paid version has a host of antitheft features, including remote commands, fake mode, location updates and more.  Also, paid version is compatible with Stride/AndroidLockXT

* iCleaner (free) default repo; for advanced features: *exile90software.com/cydia* - excellent device junk cleaner, if you opt for the “pro” version (still free) it also has daemon management and mobilesubstrate on/off switches.  The regular version is all the average user needs

* Icon Passcode (free) – individually lock specific apps

* Icon Thief (free) – if you ever want to try your hand at theming, you need this.  Bundles all your app icons into a .zip folder and emails them, with the correct filenames and all

* Iconoclasm/Iconoclasm Layout Maker (1.99?) – make/employ your own icon layouts. I used to use this more, especially before Gridlock was released for iOS 6. Once again… No rules!

* IconRotator (free) – simple tweak, your icons rotate with the orientation. Looks nice. 

* iFile (can’t remember) – crucial to any jailbroken phone, an on-phone file manager reminiscent of finder on a mac or explorer on a windows PC

* iFix Brightness for 6.x (free) *no longer available from ModMyI* - I never had any issues after installing this, so I assume it worked.  Not sure why it’s been removed.

* Intelliscreen X 6 (9.99) – While I hate this company’s update policy, it’s an extremely practical tweak, and probably the number one reason I jailbreak.  It’s expensive though, you may want to go the cheaper route with LockInfo and BiteSMS (Messages+ comes free with ISX and replaces the need for BiteSMS)

* Internalizer (free) – I don’t currently use it since it would clash with my theme, but lets you put text on the lockscreen quickly and easily

* Invisible Grabber 5.1+ (free) – technically a theming element, but I decided to put it here. Removes the camera grabber icon while keeping the functionality

* JellyLock (free) beta: *cydia.myrepospace.com/maxkatzmann* - highly functional, well stylized unlock function like that on Android’s Jellybean.  Still in development, but works great, and has excellent settings options

* Kamera (free) – put native-looking shortcut buttons in the NC to open the front or rear camera; hold to open it in video

* Landscape Videos (free) – when in portrait orientation lock, videos are still forced to landscape mode

* LastPic (free) – when attaching messages in the standard message app, gives an option to directly attach the last picture taken

* Lockscreen Clock Hide (free) – useful for most themers; does what it says

* Low Power Banner (free) – gives a banner when low on power or plugged in, rather than annoying alerts.  Very customizable

* MobileTerminal (free) – an on-phone command terminal. I only use it to change my passwords and for the command ‘top’ (another download, set your usertype to “hacker” or “developer” to see it), but it’s more useful to people who actually know what they’re doing

* MultiIconMover (free) – what it says is what it does. Very functional.

* MxTube (free) – download videos from youtube to view later

* Nitrous (.99) – makes any non-native app that uses javascript much faster (e.g. AlienBlue, Facebook, Chrome)

* No Keyboard Spotlight (free) – I like spotlight occasionally, but when I accidentally swipe to it there’s a split second of lag that gets irritating.  This removes that, spotlight is still functional but the keyboard isn’t automatic

* No Ads (free) *cydia.myrepospace.com/Kshizoku* - This guy only has three tweaks, but they’re free and not piracy (he wrote his own code), and they work as well/better than their paid counterparts

* No Dictation (free) – removes the voice dictation key on the keyboard

* NoLockNotificationsBG (free) – stacked notifications on the LS no longer have a dark background (see: clearnotifications)

* NoStoreButton (free) – removes the Music app’s store button

* Octopus Keyboard (4.99) optional beta: *k3a.me/c/*– predictive typing. I was torn after getting this because I didn’t feel like I was typing much faster and I missed SwipeSelect.  But then I lost it for a bit when it stopped working, and realized how much of a difference it makes.  The beta is definitely faster and supposedly works with swipeselect, but that second part is really buggy still so I don’t have swipeselect installed

* OpenNotifier (free) – puts customizable notification markers in your statusbar for various apps

* Orientation Activator (free) – set an Activator listener to change the orientation lock toggle

* PandoraSkips (free) – unlimited Pandora skips

* Phantom (free) – break all the rules in Snapchat (stay away from PicArchiver, it makes SnapChat crash 9 times out of 10)

* Pokemon HP Battery (free) – technically a theme, but so awesome it deserves a mention.  Makes your battery charging screen look like a pokemon status bar; the HP is equivalent to the percent charge

* Pops 2 HD &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; SD Alert Theme (free) – also a theme, but just for popups and worth taking a look at

* PrivaCy (free) – universal opt-out of usage tracking

* QuickShoot (free) – doubletap the camera grabber or the icon to quickly snap a photo

* RateBlocker (free) *n00neimp0rtant.dyndns.org/repo* - blocks in-app “rate me” popups. Works wonderfully.

* RespringCacheFix (free) *rpetri.ch/repo/* – fixes some issue I don’t understand with junk files after a respring in iOS 6

* Safari Download Enabler (free) – crucial.  Does what it says

* Safari Omnibar (free) – I don’t know why this isn’t implemented in Vanilla Safari yet

* SafariSwipez (free) – better Safari tab management

* Slider Pro (free) – customization for your unlock slider (I removed this when I got jellylock

* SnowCover 4 (free) – very elegant LS music player

* SpringFlash (free) – set an activator listener for your flashlight (mine is both volume keys simultaneously). Incredibly practical.

* Springtomize 2 (2.99) – lots of springboard tweaks, removed the need for a number of little tweaks

* StatusTab (free) – rather than a tab, touching the top of the screen in fullscreen mode shows the whole statusbar

* ThemeIconMaker (free) – themes package icons, indispensable to themers

* ThumbsUp (free) – brand new, haven’t tried it yet. Supposedly allows activator gestures for thumbs up/down in Pandora and gives fully functional buttons for the LS. Still a little glitchy in appearance.

* Typestatus (free) – get a logo in your statusbar when someone with iMessage is writing to you

* WallpaperJPEGifier (free) – converts your wallpapers to jpeg versions, useful for some themes

* WeeSearch (free) – NC quick search bar (can be placed on the HS with Dashboard X)

* xCon (free) beta: *n00neimp0rtant.dyndns.org/repo* - stops apps from recognizing your device as jailbroken

* YoutubetoMP3 (free) – convert youtube videos to audio tracks, right on your phone (please don’t use this to steal music)

* Zephyr (4.99) - #1 most used tweak I have, now I never have to use the home button and rarely ever the switcher. Worth every penny, and then some.

* Zeppelin (free) – carrier logo changer, download alternate logos or use one from their default set

* 2x2 Folder Layout (free) *cydia.myrepospace.com/KShizoku* – I know Ayecon has a tweak that does this for a cost, but KShizoku wrote his own, fully functional code and offers it for free.

If you like this, you can support me by buying my two new tweak coming out in the next few days: CustomGrid 2 and MultiDock, and follow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/Crossingman

Cheers!

EDIT: Turns out the library I was using to determine the dominant color is incredibly inefficient. I'm going to have to rewrite it to make stuff faster. I won't be able to release this before some time.

EDIT 2: I used a different library and stripped a lot of useless thing. Things should be a bit faster. I'll add a setting with the option to reduce accuracy of the color in favor of speed."	t5_2r8c5	True

1358164149.0	16jpg1	Announcing Flex, and seeking beta testers	somethingpunk	194	16	67	"For the past few weeks I've been working on a rather large project. It's a new jailbreak app called **Flex**. What it does it let you create small tweaks, share what you create, and download others' shared tweaks.  I expect to release it pretty soon, just need to have it go through a beta phase.
   
  To give you a better idea here's a screenshot of the [patches view](http://i.imgur.com/mgv8D.png). Each of those patches consists of one or more ""units"". A unit [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/cWYJt.png), and it's what does the work.
  
  You can instantly [download patches](http://i.imgur.com/POxPn.png) from within the app, and activate them straight away.

Patches are very easy to make, and give you quite a lot of power. You can make them for any application you have installed, even SpringBoard. They don't contain any real code, the tweak portion of Flex is actually what does all the heavy lifting... so basically these patches can't be installed outside of Flex.
  
You can also follow [my twitter @punksomething](https://twitter.com/punksomething) for updates
  
**EDIT:**

It would be awesome because users would be able to just browse the repo for stuff in Cydia directly.

Here are some tips to protect your jailbreak	rcnino	203	32	59	"Apple has stopped signing 6.1.2 and everyone's jailbreak just became infinitely more valuable. No one wants to screw up their phone and be forced to go to 6.1.3. And let's face it, iOS *SUCKS* without a jailbreak. I've put together some general tips for the average user to preserve your jailbreak so you won't have to worry.

* Avoid pirated tweaks/repos, first and foremost. They aren't always up to date with the latest fixes and have to employ some form of hackery to work. They don't check for compatibility or dependencies either. You've been warned.
* Get tweaks from the default repos. They are maintained by Saurik and others to provide the best possible Cydia and jailbreak experience.
* Keep it lean. iOS is built to run exceptionally well by itself, mostly due to how locked down it is. The more you change it the higher the chance of instability. Keep the tweak count down and uninstall anything you aren't using.
* Don't go tinkering under the hood. It's very easy to dive into the file system and start moving/copying/deleting files and changing plist values. Just because you can, or someone else did, doesn't mean you should.
* **Read the sidebar**. I can't stress this enough. There are some great guides to teach you the ins and outs of jailbreaking. Click on every link and learn something. 
* Use common sense. There are a lot of people who are new to jailbreaking on this sub. If you don't fully understand something or don't have the knowledge and experience to protect yourself from yourself, don't touch it. Whatever you're trying to do, you can probably live without it. It's better than living without a jailbreak.
* [Google](https://www.google.com) is your friend.

That being said, there are a lot of experienced jailbreakers here willing to help. Found a tweak you want? Ask if anyone has used it. Having an issue? **Read the sidebar**, then post your questions. Including what device and firmware along with a list of tweaks will get you an answer faster. 

Please feel free to elaborate or challenge my points. I'll update the list with anything worthy.

Active Dock: ($1.99) Makes the dock look more like OSX. Adds a signal light for running apps and bounces the icons that have recent notifications.

Away Text: Sends a predefined away text when activated. Also adds a toggle in SBSettings for easy activation.

ayecon: ($2.99) Current theme. Definitely worth checking out.

ayecon SBSettings Theme: Changes the theme of SBSettings to match ayecon

Barrel: ($2.99) Animations when scrolling from one springboard page to the next.

biteSMS: (Freemium) Adds a quick reply feature to messaging and some other useful options.

BluSelect 5.0+: (Paid) Allows me to define an activator gesture to select which bluetooth device to connect to. A lot more useful that just turning bluetooth on or off.

Browser Changer: Changes the default browser to something besides Safari. Also adds the option to change your default maps client.

BytaFont: Change the system font.

Hands-Free Control: ($2.99) Makes Siri always listening to her callup word. I have it set to only activate when on AC Power as it really drains the battery.

iCaughtU Pro: ($2.50) Takes a picture with the front camera if the passcode is entered wrong. Also scans incoming text messages to activate alarms, cameras, or power options remotely. It's nice if you set it to something nobody would ever text you.

iFile: (Paid) Adds a file explorer to iPhones files.

ShowCase: Makes the keyboard show the case that will be typed, instead of CAPS all the time.

SpringFlash: Turn on camera with an activator gesture or button. Mine is set to hold Volume Up.

Springtomize 2: ($2.99) Adds a ton of tweaks to modify springboard, notification center, lockscreen, etc. all in one place. Very useful and worth the money.

I've recently purchased an iPhone 5 and, being a developer myself, love the new iOS 6.1 jailbreak. Kudos to the evad3rs, enjoy the booze. What follows is a collection of applications, themes and tweaks from Cydia which I have installed on my phone. Total cost of all tweaks listed here is $22.13 USD (or, if you decide to buy an iFiles license and remove ads from biteSMS, $34.12 USD).

This is my first post on reddit, I hope I got the formatting right. :)

*Theme:*

Screenshot: http://imgur.com/YY7zHvi  
Wallpaper source: http://bypxl.com/iphone-5/wallpapers/blue-out-space  
Winterboard settings: http://imgur.com/a/DI0Nf

**Glasklart** (free) - Theme with glass-like icons  
**Glasklart Icons Normal** (free) - Not available on Cydia! Installation is simple via SSH (make sure unzip and wget are installed via Cydia). Once done activate it via Winterboard: `cd /Library/Themes &amp;&amp; wget http://glasklarthd.dreamnet.at/download/Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip &amp;&amp; unzip Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip &amp;&amp; rm Glasklart_Icons_normal.zip`  
My own icons pack for Glasklart - Stay tuned

*Theme/interface-related tweaks from Cydia:*

**Accelerate** (free) - Speed up animations. Although animations are used to bridge loading times, most processes on the iPhone 5 complete before the animation is done. I have set Accelerate to 'Fast'. Settings: http://imgur.com/a/ApDR7  
**Action Menu** (free) - Replaces the edit menu (which pops up when you tap on text) by icons, adds useful actions  
**Action Menu Plus Pack** ($2.99 USD) - Adds useful actions to Action Menu, supports the developer and removes the Upgrade button. See screenshots for configuration.  
**AntiTint** (free) - Keeps status bar's color from shifting within an application  
**Auxo** ($1.99 USD) - An amazing app switcher replacement, comes with a great design and toggles that cover pretty much all functionality of SBSettings.  
**Bars** (free) - Extends the signal strength indicator by incremental steps.  
**Bolt** (free) - Removes the battery icon and displays a bolt only while your phone is charging. Useful when showing the battery's exact capacity is enabled.  
**Cyntact** ($1.00 USD) - Adds pictures to your contacts list.  
**f.lux** (free) - Make your screen look better at night. Also check out their desktop application, you'll love it.  
**Five Icon Dock** (free)  
**FullForce for Phone** ($0.99 USD) - Adjust the layout of some legacy application to fill the iPhone 5 screen. Definitely better than the free alternatives since it asks you whether to apply the fix the first time you start a legacy application and is able to apply changes to the configuration without respringing.  
**SimpleWiFi for NotificationCenter** (free) - Shows your IP and the SSID of the WLAN access point you are currently connected to (useful for OpenSSH).  
**Zephyr** ($4.99 USD) - Very nice but pricey multi-tasking tweak. Slide up from the bottom of your screen in order to close an application, slide up a bit and hold to show the app switcher (works well with Auxo), slide from left-to-right or right-to-left in order to quickly switch applications (can be customized to not interfere with application functionality, see screenshots).  
**Zeppelin** (free) - Hide the carrier name or replace it by an icon.

*Applications and tweaks from Cydia:*

**AppInfo** (free) - Creates system reports, useful for quickly gathering bundle names for making custom icons.  
**biteSMS** (free, $7.99 USD to remove ads) - Very nice replacement for Apple's Messages app. Supports iMessage. Provides a popup (similar to the Twitter one) for sending and replying to SMS, even from the lockscreen. Can forward SMS when you're away.  
**Curiosa** (free, beta, add repo http://rpetri.ch/repo/) - Integrates Cydia into notification center, displays notifications for available updates.  
**iFile** (free, $4.00 USD for more features) - The mobile file manager.  
**Nitrous** ($0.99 USD) - Speeds up web-based third-party applications by allowing them to use Safari's JavaScript engine.  
**OpenSSH** - Remotely (or locally) access the iPhone's command line. Can also be used to transfer files. Make sure to change the password of the 'root' and 'mobile' account after installing OpenSSH. If you don't, everyone on the network you are on (if you are connected via 3G or similar, you are on a network too) can access all of your files and personal data. Instructions on how to change your password: http://cydia.saurik.com/password.html  
**PrivaCy** (free) - Blocks user tracking networks.  
**ProTube 2** ($1.99 USD) - Adds download functionality and an option to switch to a different video quality (even when on 3G) to the YouTube app from Google.  
**RespringCacheFix** (free, beta, also in rpetri.ch's repo) - Deletes temporary files  
**SwipeShiftCaret** (free) - Very nice extension for editing text. Move the cursor by swiping over the text. Make sure to enable the v-lock option in its configuration.  
**SpringFlash** (free) - activate the camera LED by pressing the standby button twice

*Web-browser extensions:*

**AdBlocker** ($2.19 USD) - Blocks ads in Safari and other applications, which speeds up browsing over a cellular connection.  
**Safari Download Manager** ($5.00 USD) - Pricey but very nice extension for Safari, great with iFile.

*Command line packages (the iPhone makes a wonderful mobile terminal; I use iSSH for accessing the phone's console):*

**7-zip** - Pack or unpack 7-zip archives  
**adv-cmds** - Collection of command line tools for process access and similar  
**APT 0.7 Strict** - Let's call it the command-line version of Cydia (while Cydia is actually the GUI-version of APT!). Works great with mobile SSH clients.  
**Aptitude** - like APT 0.7 Strict, but with a command line UI. usually a better alternative to APT when accessing the phone from a computer.  
**cURL** - Downloads and upload anything using pretty much any protocol  
**diskdev-cmds** - Collection of command line tools (mount and alike)  
**screen** - Terminalception  
**shell-cmds** - Collection of some essential command line tools (which and alike)  
**top** - The classic process manager  
**unrar** - Unpack rar files  
**unzip** - Unpack zip files  
**wget** - Downloads files via HTTP  
**zip** - Pack zip files

*Manual fixes:*

Apps which run as root (like Cydia or iFile) still have click sounds, even though you might have disabled them in the Settings app. The following command fixes this by creating a link of the relevant configuration file to mobile's configuration file (source: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=830780):

(In no particular order)

* Curiosa (rpetri.ch/repo) - checks for updates to Cydia packages in the background, adjustable periods between checks from hourly to daily. Can also be assigned to an activator listener

* dismissmykeyboard - swipe from spacebar to return button to remove the keyboard

* deleteword - press shift+delete to delete a full word, not just a character

* NoAds (cydia.myrepospace.com/kshizoku) - excellent free adblocker

* 2x2 folder icons (cydia.myrepospace.com/kshizoku) - a free substitute to do this for those who haven't bought Ayecon or the tweak available on a public repo

* Kamera - adds shortcut buttons to the NC for front and rear camera, very fast. Can be added to the springboard with dashboard x, if you have it

* Typestatus - adds a speech bubble to the statusbar indicating when someone with imessage is currently writing a response to your message

* Lastpic -adds a button to the  messaging app when including a photo with a message, since this is the photo you want 90% of the time

* Nowplaying on statusbar - when playing music from most sources, the statusbar flips between displaying the time, the name of the artist, and the name of the song

* Hud - when music is playing, the volume HUD will display the album art and artist/song name in tandem with the volume counter

Accelerate - replaced FakeClockUp, ability to adjust speed without respringing and disabling for certain things like the loading wheel and editing home screen icons/moving them the wiggle is stock speed instead of looking wigged out. Tried %hook's law also but the springiness made me uninstall it and revert to FakeClockUp before finding this. 

Activator - plug in headphones, play music immediate. Slide finger over clock in status bar to simulate a press of the lock button (put phone to sleep with a quick gesture)

AdBlocker - try to kill off iAds in apps and make the browsing experience and youtube watching experience a lot more hassle free

Auxo - card style multitasking, hold finger to 'delete all apps' -- replaced WeeKillBackground for me

Callbar - receive and get calls while still doing my thing on the phone, without it taking over the whole screen

Chromizer - Full screen for Chrome, gestures

Color Keyboard - theme my keyboard to look like MBP keys

Color Profiles - dont need, but if my screen was a weird tint or not the greatest quality it would/has helped in the past

f.lux - be good to my eyes at night and warm the screen temperature so it doesn't effect my ability to go sleep and mess with my REM. scientific.

FastBlurredNotifcationCenter - got from RPetrich's repo, blurred and transparent background. EDIT: nice but I just used Springtomize blur feature and uninstalled this app. But still great if you don't have springtomize. 

FullForce for iPhone - make black bar apps full screen without respringing and first time starting up the app

FullSCreen for Safari - gestures and full screen portrait mode

iCleaner - get rid of history, incomplete Cydia downloads, just stuff that's truly taking up space. Will use once a month

iFile - file structure of iPhone

infinifolders - no limit on apps in folders

Intelliscreen X - twitter and reader and mail in NC. shows icons when muted in status bar, when receiving text and email missed calls, etc. Allows NC to be used on lock screen. Includes Messages+ for quick compose and reply. Gets rid of need for BiteSMS

MultiIconMover - move multiple icons at a time page to page

NCSettings - toggles in NC. Kills the need for SBSettings

Nitrous - enables Nitro javascript engine on apps aside from safari like chrome, imdb, facebook, alien blue. REALLY fast and awesome

Respringcachefix- from Rpetrich repo too, respringing a lot in 6.1 junks up the phone with files. this nips it in the bud

Safaridownloadmanager 

Pandora Downloader - no skip limit, no ads, get songs

Springtomize - shrink icons, customize dock, 'slide to unlock' text, status bar elements, disable newstand, hide badges on folders, etc etc 

SwipeShiftCaret - swipe selection over text to avoid typos

TetherMe - enable native tethering 

UnrestrictPremium -- allow airplay over HBO and SHO apps

XBMC - handles all media formats 

Zephyr - replaces home button, slide up to exit

Zeppelin - graphics where the carrier name is

3G unrestrictor - get FaceTime back, remove MB limitations on apps, streaming quality, etc."	t5_2r8c5	True

---

**Posting/Commenting Guidelines:**

* Double check before posting that your tweak has not already been added.
* Double check to make sure your tweak was released in 2012.
* **One** tweak per comment. Please include a **short description** of the tweak or screenshot of the theme. It's repo, price, and iOS version compatability would be nice too but are not required.

 Examples:

 &gt; **Barrel** - Modifies the paging animation. BigBoss, $2.99, compatible with iOS 6

 or 

 &gt; [**Glasklart**](http://www.maxthemes.com/weblinks/GKHD-0-Photo.jpg) - ModMyi, free, HD &amp; SD versions available

* **Upvote** tweaks you like. If you dislike the tweak, **comment explaining why instead of downvoting**. Downvoting does no good and defeats the purpose of having a poll in the first place.
* **Top level comments (direct replies to this post) are reserved for tweak/theme nominations.** [General discussion, comments, questions, or tweak suggestions go here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/166ym9/rjailbreaks_favorite_tweaks_of_2012/c7tapnr)

- Edit info for songs in your library, artwork in particular. 

- View and manage iOS's dictionary of learned words.

- Automatically switch from Siri to voice control when a data connection isn't available or just be able to use voice control while Siri is enabled. 

- Using iTunes Match, show all locally stored tracks without having to turn on airplane mode or flip the switch in settings. 

- An app or tweak that integrates popular messaging services with facebook chat heads or the default messages app. 

- Backgrounder, revived. Prevent apps from being paused in the background, either so that they will continue running indefinitely or stop entirely. 

- Pin reminders to notification center without having to set an alarm for them. Also, the ability to mark them as completed from notification center and the lockscreen. 

- Add items to various share menus. Thinking quickly about how this could be done, the Photos app menu could include all apps that support ""open in..."" for images and the Safari menu could include JavaScript bookmarklets that send links to third-party apps. 

- Alternative keyboards such as Swiftkey or Fleksy. 

- The ability to set a particular app as your lockscreen background such as yahoo weather. 

- Pretty much any concept from designers [Joshua Tucker](http://dribbble.com/joshmtucker) (Callbar, Reveal, Abstergo, Emblem, Merge) and [Sentry](http://dribbble.com/Sentry.NC) (Luna, Auxo) that haven't been made yet. "	t5_2r8c5	True

These reports can give valuable insights into iOS vulnerabilities which may one day lead to new, untethered jailbreak methods.

To use this program, all you need to do is attach your iOS device to your computer and click a single button!

If you have never used C-Dev Reporter before, you will most likely find hundreds of crash reports that may be valuable to the future of our jailbreak scene. [More info from the makers of Abisinthe](http://greenpois0n.com/tag/cdev-reporter/).

It's certainly not polished, but someone released a .ipa for ""nds4ios"", which is a working DS emulator for iOS.

I just tried it on my iPhone 5 and got Fire Emblem going at 60 fps (it's a 2D game so that's to be expected; not sure about 3D game performance). The GUI is extremely lame right now and it actually doesn't support the iPhone 5 screen, but there's definitely potential as this is the first working DS emulator I've seen so far.


Link is here for the brave ones who want to try:
http://speedy.sh/8srD2/nds4ios.rar


My basic guide:

1. Extract the .ipa from the .rar and install it with IPA Installer or something else.

2. Magically acquire a .nds ROM file and copy it to the Documents folder in the nds4ios folder in /var/mobile/Applications (this is a lot easier with iExplorer or iTools rather than iFile).

3. Open nds4ios and the ROM should appear there."	t5_2r8c5	True

1367384593.0	1dgqv5	I cleared nearly three gigs of space on my iPhone, and you can too!!! Here's how..	seeittobelieveit	150	22	87	"While rippin through my phone using iFile, I noticed a folder that was a cache of pics from texting. That seems about right.  However, some of these were pics from threads I had deleted long, long ago. So I took some time, about three hours, to go through the entire folder and determine what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to delete. In the end, I cleared 2.8 Gigs of cached pics. Apparently I text pics back and forth often. Go to folder /Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/. Inside there, you'll find folders labelled Attachments, Drafts and Parts. Attachments has all the cache of pics you've ever sent or received in a text. Once you delete the file out of attachments, you likely wont see too many in the Parts folder. Don't worry about deleting the entire folder either, it's ok to do so. If you send or receive another pic, or any other media file, your phone will simply create another folder in /Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/. Hope this helps!!  
Edit: I'm rockin an iPhone 4 on iOS 6.1.2 and Cydia 1.1.8  
EDIT 2: I HAVE A THEORY AS WELL. If you restore your phone to an old restore point, say from a couple years ago, jailbroke it again and went into the same folder (/Var/Mobile/Library/SMS/), you might find even older pics. But it's just a theory. I may try it one day and when I do, I'll be sure to give a heads up  
  
EDIT 3: Looks like I just cleared another ton of space without any adverse effects. About another Gig in fact. I found just over 2,000 files at anywhere from 3Kb to 12Kb in the imageCache folder, located in /var/mobile/Library/Caches/imageCache. I looked at around 50 of these files and they all seem to be images cached from the appstore, itunes, etc..

Same results in Safe Mode, Chrome only works for 6 seconds then crashes.  Anyone else having this issue or know a fix please?

Temporary **Solution** courtesy of u/FStt: 

-  First **uninstall Chrome related tweaks specifically EasyRefresh &amp; Chrome Download Manager and any of those chrome customizers customizations chromizers whatever they're called** (check other chrome related tweaks you have and uninstall those, **Nitrous does not need to be uninstalled**) 

-  Then uninstall &amp; reinstall Chrome.  However, you do not need to uninstall Chrome if you can get into Chrome's Privacy Settings and enable sending anonymous usage data to Google.  If you can't get to Chrome's Privacy Settings, then uninstall &amp; reinstall Chrome and go to step 3

-  Then **choose to send anonymous usage data info to Google** when you open Chrome.

Note:  This temporary solution is based of the comments in this post. This is not an official solution.  I personally only had 1 tweak that was in conflict with the updated Chrome, I'm not trying to bash any tweaks.

We've gotten a large amount of new subscribers in the last three weeks (Hi there!), so for those who don't know, this is just something that I decided to put together for the community at the end/start of each month. It's just a highlight of new tweaks released during the month that I found interesting or worth mentioning. This way, you don't have to browse the Changes section of Cydia constantly, and hopefully, this will bring some new tweaks to your attention that you may have missed or skipped over.

And remember, this is a self-post, so I get no karma for this. So please upvote so that everyone in our community can see it (because not everyone browses /new).

---

* **Assistant Language+** [$0.99, BigBoss] - Enables different languages for Siri on iOS5.
* **Bridge** [$1.99, BigBoss] - This tweak allows you to import music and videos from anywhere on your device into your music library without the use of iTunes or your computer. You can set things like the title, artist, album, genre, and album art.
* **DoNotDisturb 2** [Free, ModMyi] - Remake of the tweak DoNotDisturb. Instead of having an NC widget, a bulletin is placed in the Notification Center.
* **Emblem** [$1.99, BigBoss, **iPad Only**] - Brings OS X-inspired notifications to the iPad. Check out screenshots for yourself, they look pretty slick.
* **Merge** [$1.49, ModMyi] - Announced by Joshua Tucker and Andrew Richardson at JailbreakCon this past Saturday, Merge allows you to merge iMessage conversations based on contact instead of address. This means that instead of having multiple conversations with the same person but different addresses, all of those conversations are merged into one.
* **MissionBoard Pro** [$2.99; BigBoss] - For those on /r/jailbreak that haven't heard of this tweak yet, you should check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/zafbd/tweak_missionboard_pro_you_asked_for_more/). It's an excellent app switcher replacement by /u/somethingpunk. He provides great support and is very open to new ideas and suggestions.

As always, there may have been a tweak or two that I skipped over that you may have liked. If that's the case, please let me know and I'll be more than happy to add it to the list.

Which tweaks did you try out this month from this list that you particularly liked? Or were there any that you found to be somewhat buggy? Please let us know!

Also, if you have any questions about the subreddit in general, this would be a good time to voice them. :)

Especially when new OS versions come out, most tweaks require entire re-writes.

I'm proud of the jailbreak community, and everything everyone has developed. I've been with the community since the very first iPhone. The very first unlock only worked on the early bootrom iPhones, and I remember going to almost 10 different stores around my state convincing the sales people to go through their stock looking for specific serial numbers. Lol.

Anyway, I just wanted to say how grateful I am for everything that's offered before I go off on my rant. Hell, I've spent SO much more money in the cydia store than I have in the AppStore. I enjoy supporting the devs, I feel like its a big circle. We support them, and they continue to put out cool software.

So. What's the point of all this? What happens when we buy software from the cydia store, and it never works as intended? What if you contact the developer for support, but never get a response?

This has happened to me on multiple occasions now. I'm beginning to feel apprehensive about purchasing software from the cydia store. What makes things worse, is that these packages are still for sale in cydia, and there's no way to report the problems.

To name a few off the top of my head... 
1) QuickMP3. A simple tweak to quickly download songs on the fly. I thoroughly enjoyed this tweak. It had a rocky start. Shoddy DRM caused it to become unusable for some time, then a couple of months later, iOS 5 came out, and the tweak was never updated. Only like 2 months of use.

2) xBackup. I was having problems with my phone, and anticipated the apple store swapping my handset for a new one. I bought xBackup to backup all my cydia apps so I wouldn't have to go through the painful process of setting everything back up and installing all the individual packages. Well guess what? It doesn't work. Arg. Wasted money and time.

3) Themes ... iFlat in particular. The author won't update it for ios 5.

There are others. A lot of my tweaks, apple has implemented themselves, and have become redundant. I understand this situation and don't see a problem.

So all in all, what incentives does a dev have to continue updating their software to make sure it continues working? Or ever works? What kind of quality control goes into the cydia store? What kind of protection do I have as a consumer against these situations? 
The cydia store is a professional business, and I expect some kind of quailty assurance.

Thanks for your time."	t5_2r8c5	True

Here's the repo if you'd like to beta test it for me. 

[cydia.myrepospace.com/MattCMultimedia](http://cydia.myrepospace.com/MattCMultimedia)

With stacks, you can create customizable stacks of apps in the dock. Swipe up on the root app and it will show the list of others you can launch by lifting your finger on them. There's a full settings pane with all kinds of custom options in Settings.app.

~~KNOWN BUG: Closing any app from the switcher disables stacks. Respring to fix. Working on it now.~~

Known Bugs:

* Safe Modes upon install on some devices

* ~~Going into Wiggle-Mode and moving an icon from the dock crashes.~~

* ~~stacks-Behind-Apps bug when it shows up behind normal apps.~~

* Settings pane is really glitchy. Doesn't load sometimes on iOS5 (I think) and crashes if you exit Settings while on a list of apps in the stack. Working on it!

* ~~Updating any app causes stuff to crash.~~

**NOTE: please include your iDevice type and firmware version if you have one of the bugs above!**

&gt; This is an original /r/jailbreak event that will take place over the next 3-4 weeks at the end of which we'll be able to determine which tweaks are the most popular in /r/jailbreak.

**How can I participate?**

&gt; * To vote, you only need to fill out a short form that will take at most 2 minutes of your time each day.
&gt; * /u/Connguy has suggested that people be allowed to create and submit their own prediction brackets. I've created /r/TweakMadness for that very purpose.

**Initial Tweak ~~Voting~~ Nominations**

&gt; **Edit:** It just occurred to me that Nominations is a better word than voting. I'm an idiot.

&gt; This form is just to decide which tweaks will be included in the tournament. The 16 or 32 tweaks with the most votes will then be put into a randomized bracket.

&gt; [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_urxjdPDKpSdHcvdWXuIrEVGyPxSlnRwfmuyeysMie4/viewform)

I hope this may help someone somewhere, even a little. All tweaks are written as they appear in Cydia so you don't have to do any guesswork when searching. All are paid as well, I as un-hoighty-toightilly as possible suggest you do the same. Sorry about some of the screenshots, I had to redact some sensitive info: http://imgur.com/a/NTROX

Enjoy:

* Activator 

* AirBlue Sharing - Share files over bluetooth. Wonderful app/tweak, I use it all the time to send small files to/from my computer and others' phones, saves me from having to email every single time.

* AnyAttach - Attach any file and as many as you want with Mail.app. I use Sparrow as a default, and Mail.app when I want to send things.

* AnyVoice - I much prefer the male British voice to the standard Siri voice. Straight male here :p

* AppCent - Shows percentage complete of updating/downloading apps where the name of the app would be.

* AssistantExtensions - All sorts of nice plugins for Siri. I use SBSToggles and JpgToSiri the most. The former is access to any SBS toggle via Siri, and the latter is for asking Siri to show a picture of whatever (source is Google Images). I attached a screenshot of this in the Imgur album. Also has Youtube search plugin.

* AssistantLove - Integrates GPS, custom music app and app launching into Siri. I use it mainly so that asking Siri for directions to somewhere launches the destination in Waze (a great crowd-sourced turn-by-turn navi app)

* biteSMS - I love the quick reply/quick compose. I have QC set to home button triple-click in Activator. Can't recommend this enough. License is half-off now.

* BrowserChooser - I use Chrome as my default browser. This tweak allows that, and turns ""Open in Safari"" into ""Open in Chrome"". Minor detail, but it makes everything more polished.

* Bulletin - Notification Center on the Lockscreen. Dismiss NC to unlock. I use it all the time.

* BytaFont - Change system font. I use Questrial, see screenshots.

* CamFast - Activator addon for a quick camera.

* ChromeCustomization - Swipe up in Chrome to refresh the page, swipe back to go back, forward to go forward. Also does some ad blocking, tracking suppression, etc.

* ClickToCall - Allows one tap (well, two) calling from Contacts. Tap the name, little popup comes up from the bottom of the page with the contact number(s), tap the one you want to call. Don't have to view the whole contact page just to make a quick call. Long press to send a message. Very nice tweak.

* Clock Hide - Hides the LS clock. Options to show the time in statusbar, date, clear background of the clock.

* Copic - Contact pictures in Phone.app, Contacts list, Messages.app, etc.

* CyDelete - Delete Cydia apps from Springboard.

* Dashboard X - Widgets on the Springboard. I love my favorite contacts being right on my springboard, memos, and weather. 

* DietBulletin - Thin alerts, the size of the statusbar. Longer alerts scroll. Very nicely done tweak.

* DoNotDisturb - Adds an option to the NC to turn on/off. Blocks all incoming alerts (phone, text, mail, twitter, etc.). Great for movies, dates, etc.

* f.lux - Controls screen ""temperature"" after sundown. Really great for the eyes at night.

* FakeCarrier - Put a fake carrier in the statusbar.

* FakeClockUp - Speeds up animations system-wide. 

* FastBlurredNotificationCenterBackground - Blurred transparent NC background, quicker than the original.

* Folder Icons - Change... folder icons. 

* FolderEnhancer - Great animations for opening folders, multiple pages, folder backgrounds, all sorts of minute adjustments to folders.

* Hands-Free Control - Siri always listens for a certain keyword to activate it, in addition to the long-press on the home button. Mine is set to ""Computer"". Works pretty nicely. I dream about the day I'm being held hostage, tied to a chair, with my iPhone on the table next to me. I simply say, ""computer"", and get Siri to call the cops.

* iCleaner - Cleans the cache, among other things that need cleaning.

* Iconoclasm - Custom icon layouts. Important for me so I can squeeze in whatever Dashboard X widgets I want.

* Iconoclasm Layout Maker - Make custom layouts for Iconoclasm.

* iFile - File browser, editor, creator. Very powerful, very useful for jailbreakers.

* Ipsum - On the lockscreen, swipe a notification to the left to dismiss. Invaluable tweak. Can also dismiss from the NC, and/or remove the app badge as well.

* JpgToSiri - Addon for Assistant Extensions to find pictures through Siri.

* Lingual - Siri translate function for Assistant Extensions.

* MobileTerminal - Terminal commands/access for iOS.

* MultiIconMover - Move multiple icons on the springboard at once by selecting them. 

* MyAssistant - System toggles, other commands (respring, re-boot, lock, find the lyrics, tweet, etc.), Activator events, custom replies (I don't use that feature) from Siri. Also can change the Siri background, bar height, and language.

* NC weather widgets - New icons for the Weather widget. Nicely stylized- see screenshots.

* NCSettings - Stylish system toggles in the NC. 

* NCSettings Streaks Theme - Streaks above and below NCSettings.

* NCTabClock - When in an app and you pull down the NC tab, there's a clock on it. Very nice little addition to make things more efficient.

* Nitrous - Basically makes third party internet-connected apps (like Chrome) faster, activating something that Apple has deactivated. That's what I understand about it.

* No Icon Shadows - Good for the icons I use.

* No Keyboard Spotlight - Keyboard doesn't pop up automatically when you scroll to the spotlight page on the springboard.

As a lot of iDevice users, I'm thinking about upgrading my iPhone to iOS 6. But I'm also thinking about a big part of my iPhone : the jailbreak.

Actually, I think a non-jailbroken iPhone/iPad is useless. Because you can't really enjoy those kind of devices with such restrictions (Thanks, Apple &lt;3).

But I did it anyway. I'm currently running a jailbroken iOS 6. Yeah. Cool. What now?

Tethered jailbreak (means I have to start my iPhone from a computer), had to install Cydia via SSH (and didn't worked several times. Took me 1hour to success, instead of 5mn with a finished jailbreak), and, most of all : ALMOST NO TWEAKS COMPATIBLE.

Actually, I run my iPhone with Zephyr, Winterboard, Activator, ManualCorrectPro, and an early BiteSMS beta (7.0b1). Almost all the tweaks says ""Not compatible with iOS 6"", or install, but doesn't work (IntelliScreenX is doing that). Themes are not doing fine too. Loop respring, or it stays in Exit Safe Mode.

So, if you don't want to be in this kind of troubles, please trust me: Be patient, and wait for a real jailbreak, with compatible tweaks.

Hope it makes you think 'bout that."	t5_2r8c5	True

1362408635.0	19n1az	Genuine, non trolling question. Why jailbroken iDevices instead of Android devices ?	Delimadelima	135	26	112	"As title, why ? This is not a judgmental thread, whether it is right or wrong, just curious about and trying to understand your rationales, that's all.


I'll start of with my own situation.


I bought a black iPhone 4 out of impulse, the day it was launched in my country. I happened to be in a shopping mall it was launched, so I joined the queue. Before this, I was using a Nokia 3310 yellow and black dumb phone. Since I had iPhone 4, I was mind blown about the capabilities of a smartphone. And I dearly regret not buying a smartphone much earlier. I lost my black iPhone 4 few months later. So I bought my white iPhone 4 which I continue to use today.


I then bought the iPad 1, just a few weeks before Cupertino announced iPad 2. While I enjoyed iPad 1 and can dearly appreciate its potential, I prefer my iPhone 4, because iPad 1 is still bulky, and most critically it didn't have any camera !!! I bite my tongue, waited very very patiently, and bought iPad 3 immediately after it was available.


I jail broke my iDevices sometimes after I bought my iPad 3. I cannot remember what exactly triggered that, and I think in general I was desiring more customization, and I thought jailbreak will make my iPhone 4 less obsolete.


Since I jail broke my iDevices, I can never go back.  Not at all interested in themes and cosmetic tweaks, I'm very interested in tweaks / apps that improve / offer brand new functions of iDevices that will make my mobile experience better and more productive.


The recent iOS 6 upgrade has brought a lot of frustrations to me, mainly tweaks incompatibility and obsoleteness. Some of them unsoldeved until now. Some of them despite being nominally declared compatible, cause persistent issues. I'm talking about paid tweaks, ~USD 5-10 tweaks 


I downgraded my iPhone 4 to 5.1.1 for this reason. I leave my iPad 3 to be iOS 6.1.2 so that I can have first experience with iOS 6 jailbreak situation. 


I can't help but wonder, why shouldn't I go for android for my next phone ? Bear in mind I have never owned an Android devices. Money is not an issue for me. I imagine I can easily but a very top end Android. Samsung Note 3 ? Motorola Rarz ? HTC One ? Huawei Ascend ? Sony Experia water and dust proof ? Root them, strip away carrier bloatwares and makers' skins, then I get to enjoy best hardware plus all that jailbreak can offer, as ""standard android customizations"".


Am I right or wrong in my understandings ? Why do you stay with iDevices if you are heavy users of jailbreak tweaks / apps ? I'm genuinely curious."	t5_2r8c5	True

My only complaint right now is that you lack a status bar, and that the black border would probably look better with the transparent background. But I can understand that my iPad 2 would probably suffer in a resource heavy iphone app on top of blurring out my dynamic background.

Also, sometimes I work in very bright areas at night, and don't need it to be warm.

This doesn't happen consistently enough for me to bother changing the time though, so that's not an option.

- Configurable team options via Settings.app

1369033026.0	1eojfq	Badger for iOS	Aehmlo	121	17	44	"Hello everybody, Aehmlo here, developer of [Badger for iOS](http://twitter.com/BadgerTweak). I just thought I should let you all know that I've submitted Badger to the BigBoss repo. If you're completely clueless and have no idea what Badger is, here's the description as it will appear in Cydia:

&gt;Badger is a revolutionary new iOS tweak allowing users to view notifications directly from app/folder icons on their home screen. Using a configurable activation method (icon swipes/badge taps), users can invoke the Badger window, a configurable window which allows them to swipe to delete notifications, view them in-app, quickly reply to iMessages/SMSs (as well as mark them read), and more.
&gt;
Badger is designed to make notifications on iOS “make sense”. It’s made to be fully themeable and customizable to make it work the way you want it to. Badger’s made to let you interact with notifications in a way that makes sense and that you can change.
&gt;
&gt;Badger is fully compatible with Abstergo, and lets users tap and hold on a notification in the Badger window to activate Abstergo for the corresponding notification. Badger is also fully compatible with Velox. They are not competitors, as they are designed to perform different functions. If you need further proof of this, it can be given through conversations on Twitter with Velox’s developers, but I won’t discuss it more here.
&gt;
&gt;Badger is fully compatible with all iOS devices on iOS 5 and higher, and is compatible with just about every tweak out there.

Badger allows you to view notifications directly from SpringBoard. It should be out in Cydia within the next 2-3 days, and will be available for $0.99. We will be joining with [iDownloadBlog](http://idownloadblog.com) to host a giveaway when they post their review tomorrow afternoon, so give that a look, too!

Feel free to comment below with any questions on Badger - I'll try to get to all of them!

~Aehmlo

P.S. Before you post any comments about Velox, read [this](http://aehmlo.com/url/vb)."	t5_2r8c5	True

New to the team are Max Katzmann (creator of the great JellyLock) and Bryce Dougherty (creator of the awesome tweak TapTapPass). We've all put a lot of work into this project, and we are ready to show you what we've come up with! 

Check out the video here:
http://vimeo.com/64430875

We've added new clocks and weather icons, and as it was one of the most requested features, you now have the ability to remove the second page! 

The app is a beautiful way to set up Peekly. You can change all the settings, update your ""peek"", and choose images from your photo library to use as wallpapers. You can even crop the images to fit. No re-springs required!  

Peekly (the lockscreen) as always will remain free (full featured). You can still control Peekly with the settings.js file.

The app however will cost a buck ($0.99). Please support devs as we spend a lot of time building these cool toys for you, and put a lot of time into support and adding new features. 

Peekly and the app will be available from Cydia soon. If you are interested in beta testing please PM me.

It did rouse my suspicions a bit but I decided to update anyways. So after the update I tried opening up snapchat but it kept crashing. I deleted then redone loaded both, with no success to either combination. So anyways heed my warning and do not update snapchat if you rely on phantom like I do for uploading my own camera roll onto it.

1364611263.0	1ba69v	Feeling lucky?	burtilicious	124	16	21	"So my iPhone 5's camera decided to take a dump on me yesterday afternoon.  The shutter was stuck and when it would open, I'd get purple bands flickering across the screen.  I knew it was done for because this is now the **THIRD** iPhone I've owned that's encountered this very problem.  Needless to say I was less than thrilled at the very real possibility that a replacement phone would end my jailbreaking days for the foreseeable future.

I had to make a decision and I had to make one fast.  Do I live with a broken camera and hang on to my 6.1.2 JB for dear life?  Or do I chance it and end up with a phone running 6.1.3 with a working camera?  I knew I was up against the clock so I decided to roll the dice.

After hearing accounts of other people starting to get 6.1.3 phones, I figured it's now or never.  I assumed the odds were in my favor having a 64GB device.  I don't know how many 16GB devices they have on hand at any given time, but I'd be willing to wager that a lot of those are on 6.1.3 by now.

As I was greeted with my shiny new replacement iPhone, my hands trembled with every press against the screen.  I couldn't get through the initial setup and activation screens fast enough.  And at last, there it was.  The Springboard in all its stock, glorious form.  I struggled to locate the Settings icon from its lifeless default layout.  I tremble with anticipation and my hands being to precipitate.

Above is a link to a survey I created for this subreddit.  It asks a variety of jailbreak questions, as well as some demographic questions.  I've been thinking about doing this for a while and decided today i'd write it.

I wrote this mostly for fun, but i'm also very curious what you guys will think about it.  If I get enough data i'll try and make some cool charts showing you all the info collected.  It'll be fun!

(I apologizing in advance for any typos you may discover.  I had to re-type everything after skydrive didn't save correctly.) 


**EDIT:  OVER 350 responses and counting!!  This is way more than I hoped to get!  Thanks to everyone who already took the survey, and still take it if you haven't yet.  I'm going to start graphing the data in a few hours.**  

***Which graphs are you most curious about?***  I may not be able to graph everything if time doesn't allow, and I want to focus on what people want to see.  I'll also upload the excel spreadsheet so you can sort through the data for yourself.  (I'll edit out usernames).

My friend buys an iPhone to HDMI adapter for his iPhone 4. He tries to get it to mirror what he is doing on the screen but I told him that he needs an iPhone 4S or better for that to work. He doesn't believe me so I tell him to call apple support and see if they can 'fix' it.

What happens next is great

He calls up and explains that he wants to mirror his iPhone 4 onto the TV. They say ""We 100% can fix that problem for you but it will cost 60$"" They had him install remote desktop software and had him on the phone for an hour until I came back over to talk to the guy on the phone. He puts me on hold for 10 minutes and comes back to tell me this

**""Okay you need to go to this website cydia and install something called displayout""**

I was so surprised that I didn't even know what to say at first. I then told him

**""Uhhh im pretty sure you need to jailbreak the iPhone to install Cydia**""

**""No sir you are actually incorrect, i'm positive you don't need to do anything like that, just go to Cydia and download displayout""**

**""Uhh....no I'm 100% positive that you need to jailbreak an iPhone to get that...""**

Long story short I had to listen to this guy for 15 minutes until he finally listened to me telling him that it was impossible to mirror his phone from the beginning and all we want is the money back since they could never have even fixed the problem. He then tells me** ""Well you have 7 days of Apple technical support but the 60$ is non refundable""
**

After haggling with the supervisor I was able to have them refund my neighbor 40$ but still I was cracking up after about how this apple support rep was telling me the way to fix their product is to ""go to this website called cydia""

TL;DR= Neighbor couldnt mirror his iPhone 4 cause of technical limitations, called up apple support they charged him 60$ to tell him to install Cydia and get Displayout and then admitted he couldn't do it from the get-go."	t5_2r8c5	True

It was probably a magical experience for us all, at least it was for me. I remember I just got the iPod touch 2nd  generation on iOS 2.1,  and I was loving it. But something was missing. While I had heard of jailbreaking, I never actually knew what it was. I looked up a tutorial online, and from then on I knew I could never go back. And yes, we all have had our frustration with the experience like having to restore numerous times and trouble with the jailbreaking programs (as they were so long) but that first experience got us here where we are today. And with that I came to see how great the community of jailbreaking is. I love this subreddit and I love all the dev's that work so hard to do this for us all. So thank you, evad3rs, thank you to everyone who made this experience so great. Let me know your experiences in the comments. "	t5_2r8c5	True

 * one that showcases the best tweaks that have been released in 2012 and
 * another that is /r/jailbreak's favorite tweaks in general.

The first will come sometime after the new year, and the second late January or early February.

I was thinking the format could match something like /r/iPad's favorite [apps](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/113gc3/ripads_favorite_apps/) and [accessories](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/113gdi/ripads_favorite_accessories/). Community members just comment with their favorite tweak (one per comment), and people upvote which ever they like. For the second post we'd come up with categories beforehand.

**If you have a different way of conducting this, please put it in the comments, no matter how dumb you think it is.**

I'm looking to do this after the holidays and New Years because then we'll have an influx of new subscribers, and people will be more likely to see it since they're no longer on vacation.

Any thoughts, questions, suggestions, comments, or concerns?

Here's the tweaks that I thought were worth noting. If you liked something released this month that isn't on the list, I'll gladly add it! You'll also notice the tweaks are in alphabetical order instead of chronological. Nobody really complained about it before, but I thought it might be a bit easier to read/digest.

MessageSwiper (available from BigBoss) allows you to quickly switch message threads with swipe gestures. ~~Only supports Message.app~~ Now supports most messaging apps, including biteSMS and WhatsApp! Fancy animations coming soon.

~~I've just pushed an update that will be available by tomorrow;~~Update live! A long swipe to the right will return to the conversation list and there is support for biteSMS and hopefully other messaging apps as well.

~~*Note: can someone get back to me on whether or not it works in WhatsApp? I don't own the app, but will purchase it if needed~~

*Note: Looks like it doesn't work with WhatsApp, sorry :( I'm working on a fix right now, so hopefully I'll figure it out soon.

*also working on the messages-hiding bug that occurs in iOS5

Next up: Settings panel to customize swipe duration, turn on/off long swipe functionality, reverse swipe directions, and create custom swipe-responsive region. Look for that update within the next two weeks.

However, my iCloud Backup was fine...  
If you remember, with iOS versions prior to 6.1, iOS was saving all ""deleted"" SMS/MMS/iMessage attachments here:
/private/var/mobile/Library/SMS/Attachments/*



Anything in that directory would get saved in your iTunes and iCloud backups. Not a huge deal with local iTunes backups, but it could *murder* the space on a free 5GB iCloud account.

But I'm on **6.1.2**, *I* shouldn't have that bug, right?

So, I started digging into directories, checking the space used by each (""du -hs *dirname*"").

This directory on my device was loaded:  
**/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.MobileSMS/ExtendedPreviews/Attachments**

It was a cache, 2.4 GB in size, of my *deleted* SMS/MMS/iMessage attachments. Ugh. Why would this still be there (I had **ZERO** images in Messages)? Why wouldn't reboots or resprings clear it? Should someone notify the **iCleaner** guy so he can add that path?

I deleted that directory, re-created it (mobile:mobile, 755), and now iTunes went from 4.26 GB of ""Other"" to just 1.66 GB.

So, if your ""Other"" is getting huge (again), you may want to check that location.

**Edit:**

I removed half my tweaks, and yet cached images were still going into ""Attachments"".
So, I made it read-only.
""chmod -w Attachments"" (or chmod 555 Attachments). If you're using iFile, set to just ""read &amp; execute"".

I've rebooted, been sending images, etc. Nothing seems to be going into Attachments, now.

I'm the developer behind the upcoming tweak, Alien Blue for Velox. I've spent the last few weeks (since Velox came out, really) working away trying to make this the most intuitive, seamless experience from your homescreen. It's been a lot harder than I initially thought, but I think I'll have a release ready for you guys within a week. I wanted to open a thread in case anyone has any questions regarding ABV, wanted to snag a beta release (limited supply, private beta), or wanted to bombard me with feature requests.

Here's the current list of features:

* Shows Reddit inbox in a Velox folder!
* Save user account information in Settings, or use the popup when opening to quickly check your inbox
* Special formatting and organizing: bolded headers, orangered if unread, (does not mark as read, otherwise that would sort of defeat the purpose), very readable bodies
* Customizable amount of messages to load at a time (1-100 per Reddit API)
* Adjust inbox padding and header opacity with Settings sliders

All of this by its own means. That means you can use this without ever even opening Alien Blue, or use whatever account you want with ABV. I'm working on tap-to-open-inbox, multiple accounts/account switching, and a few more minor features, but they might not come before the initial release. I'm aiming for a $0.99 pricetag, if that sounds reasonable (sorry!).

1341034041.0	vtxho	Safari Download Manager: An Apologia.	DHowett	93	9	36	"Hey.

I know there's a good amount of people here who are - quite rightly - mad about SDM, its failed support, its ridiculously long update cycle, and its all-too-timely release compared to the existence of Safari Download Enabler.

I'd like to clear things up, if that's alright.

I'm just an engineer, and just a person - subject to every fault and foible to which any other engineer, or even any other person is subject. I make mistakes, misjudgements, miscalculations, and I misspeak, misquote, and misstep.

I realize the timing seems a little bit stupid, a little bit silly, and more than a little malicious - but all I can give you is my word that it's been being worked on in almost every breath of spare time I could allot to it. It's true that I have a job (as Tatticted pointed out that I'd said, in the original SDM 2 thread) - but I'm not trying to make excuses. Sometimes people can't focus - sometimes I can't focus, even - but this isn't a sob story excuse either. It just happens. In the weeks, months, years I've been working on SDM with francis, sometimes the interest strikes me and sometimes it does not. It doesn't mean that I don't want it to exist, or don't want it to continue, or don't want people to benefit from it, or want to push it off on some third party so that they may benefit where I've left off - strictly because of the ownership and responsibility I feel for it.

The truth of the matter is that the code - you're quite correct (again, Tatticted) - sucked! SDM 1 was badly architected but somehow managed to work. I've tried to pour all my effort into refactoring it to be clean and future-proof (which, to some extent, it now is: it appears to work unmodified on the iOS 6 betas, for example, which should guarantee a long life of support in the future.)

The developer of Safari Download Enabler did ask me to turn it over - I never replied, as I usually don't for e-mail (which admittedly sucks a lot, I'm sorry) - but I did not, not because I don't like him or his project, simply because of that ownership and desire to actually do something with it. I didn't release it just now to spite him, to stomp all over him, or to move at all against him. I released it just recently because I promised June, and I wanted to meet that deadline.

I do want everybody in this community to be happy, to learn and grow and work together, and I'm truly sorry anything other than that has come across in what I've said. I don't mean to say anything about his work, and saying it sucked was certainly a harsh knee-jerk reaction (and I do regret it).

To be completely honest - it takes a lot of skill for anybody to do anything like this. He's not in any way a bad developer, and I don't think that he's in any way deserving of disrespect. He simply saw a gap in features, and wanted to close that hole to make the community better. That's what we're all here for, in the end: the jailbreak userbase and the jailbreaking cause.

I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I hope that I get a chance to regain your trust, and I hope that we can grow beyond this."	t5_2r8c5	True

1337608154.0	txhk7	Some facts about the 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak	SysyphusX	88	5	81	"[@MuscleNerd](https://twitter.com/#!/musclenerd) wrote a quick sheet about the upcoming tools ([link](http://musclenerd.com/quick511info.txt)).

I won't rephrase him, so here are the contents of the file at the time of writing :

* All info below is tentative and subject to last minute refinements

* @pod2g's 5.1.1 jailbreak+untether is working out great.  All devices are covered except for AppleTV3,1, which currently has no path for jailbreaking.
 - the initial 5.1.1 plan used a kernel exploit from @westbaer which unfortunately precluded use in iPod3,1 and iPhone2,1
 - @planetbeing stepped up and provided a kernel exploit that covers both of those.  Those two JBers are the bomb!

* The 5.1.1 A5 JB is very similar to the A5 5.0.1 JB.  @pimskeks has done a tremendous job supporting both 5.0.1 and 5.1.1 in absinthe

* Similar to 5.0.1, there will also be a 5.1.1 CLI ""cinject"" binary and redsn0w version of the 5.1.1 JB+untether.  Absinthe, cinject, and redsn0w will all provide the same JB in different fashions.
 - timing is indeterminate.  Plans are for this week, but a number of factors can influence that.

* For those wishing to donate, we've set up a new 5.1.1 paypal URL:  [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=4U6DQGJ2NRVUN)

&gt;Orangered is a dynamic, virtually seamless way to unite iOS and Reddit in perfect harmony. Using programically-tight methods of retrieving, processing, and presenting Reddit information, Orangered is the best way to stay on top of your inbox. After proving your identity, this jailbreak tweak (for all devices running iOS 5.0-6.1.2) will automatically check your Reddit inbox for unread messages and replies. Put in your ideal checking interval (how long you want Orangered to wait before checking your inbox again, in minutes or hours), save your information, and let Orangered works its magic. Never think about your new posts, comments, or mentions again.

&gt;Currently supports Alien Blue, Karma, upvote, iAlien, amrc, Redditor, and Safari (just in case). Requests for more clients welcome!

Orangered will be available within a few days on the BigBoss repository for $0.99. It's been under some intense development for the past few weeks, and it's finally time to open it to the world. Please ask any questions about the tweak, the process, or myself here. Thanks so much for waiting this long, and I promise not to disappoint.

Just like with *Alien Blue Velox*, I'll be hosting an /r/jailbreak giveaway shortly after Orangered appears in Cydia. Get ready!

**EDIT:** this also works great with tweaks like DietBulletin and OpenNotifier! Orangered adds a section in the main Notification settings area for your client of choice so you can work with the alerts like you would with any push notification.

&gt; All credits go to /u/JewishCowboy for the [idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1bei2p/tweaks_released_in_march_2013/c9659b1).

&gt; This is an original /r/jailbreak event that will take place over the next month at the end of which we'll be able to determine which tweaks are the most popular in /r/jailbreak.

**How can I participate?**

&gt; * To vote, you only need to fill out a short form that will take at most 2 minutes of your time each day.
&gt; * /u/Connguy has suggested that people be allowed to create and submit their own prediction brackets. I've created /r/TweakMadness for that very purpose.

**Day 1 Matches**

&gt; We will be having matches 1-4 today in order to speed up the process. They will be open for approximately 48 hours. Tomorrow, matches 5-8 will be held and also be open for 48 hours.
&gt; The matches are:

&gt; 1. Intelliscreen X vs Killbackground
&gt; 2. Winterboard vs Bars
&gt; 3. AutoLSMusicControls vs Flex
&gt; 4. SBSettings vs f.lux

&gt; ~~Google Form to vote~~ Voting has been closed.

**Nomination Results**

&gt; This was much more successful than I anticipated it would be, here's some quick stats:

&gt; * 236 total submissions
&gt; * 1885 total votes
&gt; * 303 total tweaks
&gt; * 165 tweaks received more than 1 vote
&gt; * 82 tweaks received 5 or more votes
&gt; * 43 tweaks received 10 ore more votes
&gt; * 16 tweaks received more than 25 votes
&gt; * 7 tweaks received more than 50 votes
&gt; * 94 was the highest followed by 90, 87, and 85
&gt; * 2 tweaks were nominated that haven't been released (Badger and Velox)

&gt; I would have liked to release a complete list of tweaks nominated along with this post, but I accidentally messed up while doing some copy and paste jobs. That will be made available at a later date.

&gt; Bracket Results @ [Challonge.com](http://challonge.com/tm2013). I decided on 64 instead of 32 tweaks in order to encompass as many tweaks as possible. The bracket has also been completely randomized to provide the fairest chance for all of the tweaks.

**/r/TweakMadness**

&gt; More details will be added to that subreddit later (after I get home from classes)

**Other Stuff**

&gt; I'm currently planning a supplementary competition that I'm sure a lot of people will be very interested in, so stay tuned!

**Thank You To**

&gt; * /u/JewishCowboy for making the suggestions
&gt; * /u/Connguy for suggesting prediction brackets
&gt; * /u/Christodouluke, /u/drewkid, /u/JewishCowboy, /u/slithek, and /u/spiceman54j for helping me run the event

A mysterious person/team has come out of nowhere the past couple weeks and claim to have a working jailbreak for ALL devices on iOS 6. It's been pretty secretive so far, but the release date is set for 12/22/12. The twitter account www.twitter.com/dreamjailbreak has been leading us to believe that it works, and he/they are going to provide video proof today. 

What are your opinions on this? Real or fake? Most of the well-known jailbreaking teams claim this to be a fake.

I theorized a while ago that this could work, and it seems that ""The Private Dev Team"" has come up with a solution in the form of a program called Bluefreeze 2.3, which works with iFaith to provide a **tethered downgrade** without SHSH blobs. It only works on devices vulnerable to limera1n, so it's really only useful if you have a specific reason for wanting to downgrade, as even an iOS version with an untethered jailbreak will be tethered due to the lack of SHSH blobs. It's still super cool though. The computer science behind it is that, using limera1n, you can execute the restore ramdisk of any iOS version without the proper blobs. Since blobs are checked on every boot, redsn0w's ""just boot"" option, which utilizes limera1n, is necessary to bypass the SHSH checks.

I'm super excited to see what you guys think, but I'm sure you'll tell me.

Even though the tweak is released, it's far from done. The 1.0 means it's stable, quick, friendly, and usable-- but maybe not the best. First and foremost, I realize that there are **way too many resprings** required in the first release, but don't worry, the 1.1 is coming very soon, and will get rid of all that.

**Anyway, how do you win? Easy:**

1) Comment below with your Cydia ID # (available under Cydia &gt; Manage Account);

2) Your favorite part, or greatest suggestion for Orangered (that isn't already in the Coming Soon area) *OR* what you would love to see in a full-blown Reddit client;

3) And (if you have a Twitter) [follow me!](http://twitter.com/insanj)

In 24 hours I'll reply to each of the winners and send off a copy!

I'd like to thank every member of /r/jailbreak so much for your support (as I did in the Settings for Orangered), and I hope to make everything about this tweak as it should. Now get to it!

**EDIT:** also, I should make a special icon (with the Orangered icon) for OpenNotifier. Gimme a bit.

**EDIT2:** also, if you downvote other contestants, it just makes me want to pick them more. Stop being mean! That's probably how I'll decide in the end, now, haha.

Essentially, you will be able to use it just as normal. But somehow (haven't figured out how you'll access it yet), you will be able to access messages from various social networks (Facebook, Twitter, App.net, Google+ if it has private messages, etc.) on the left and right sides, and reply to them/start new ones. We will even attempt to support multiple accounts, but that may be limited. What do you think - should we make a tweak to extend the messages app across social networks as well as simply instant messages?

&gt; The first Tweak Madness has finally finished!

&gt; It took several weeks longer than I would have liked due to my busy daily schedule. Posts were irregular, and glaring flaws were revealed in its structure early on. However, considering this was the first time I've ever ran an event like this, I'd say it was reasonably successful, and the general overall response was positive. I saw Max Katzmann (dev of JellyLock) talking about it on Twitter a few times, and even Ryan Petrich voted twice! (at least I think it was him)

&gt; I'd like to take the time to ask the /r/jailbreak community, what are your thoughts about this event? **(Please don't downvote people who disliked the event, everyone's entitled to their own opinion)**

&gt; Edit: If you're more comfortable PMming me suggestions, that's fine as well!

&gt; * Did you enjoy participating in it?
&gt; * Was it good? Was it crappy?
&gt; * What did you like about it? What could have been better?
&gt; * Any other thoughts, questions, comments, and concerns?
&gt; * And most importantly, would you like to see it again next year?

&gt; Finally, what everyone's most interested in:

**Championship Results**

&gt; 1st:   Activator

So far, me and its_not_herpes have created a functional music player, with ALMOST all the features of the default music app. We still need to work in sorting, shuffle and repeat support. Once all that is in, we will work on implementing our new designs and ideas. Our current build is version 0.0.4. We plan on having 0.1 (all the features of default music with our new design and some new features) on April 20th.

Our official pricing: Alpha (v0.1-0.5) will be free on thebigboss repo.
Beta (0.5-0.9) will be 0.99 on thebigboss repo.
Final (1.0 onward) will be 1.99 on thebigboss repo and the official App Store. Features Apple won't allow will be unlockable in a free tweak on thebigboss. People who buy it on thebigboss will automatically get all the features.

Our thebigboss version will require verification with our servers. Without verification, you will run the free alpha version. With the verification, you will be able to run the latest version. App Store version will function normally without server verification. 

People who purchase the beta for 0.99 will be able to update to the final version for .49 more. So the total cost for the beta testers will be 1.48, instead of 1.99. Not a huge difference, but still.

Thank you for showing your support and we are here to serve you.

UPDATE 1: We need name ideas, our old idea is copyrighted by BBC ;-;

Jacob Jones"	t5_2r8c5	True

Since 2008, I've been jailbreaking and doing those silly little things that make my iDevice my own. I even remember when geohot was the first to unlock the iPhone and nobody believed him. But as the years have come and gone, the community we all (hopefully) knew and loved, faded away. Old developers once happy and ready to help the community, have become jaded and for lack of a better word, have become assholes. (I'd act the same way, trust me). Apple has more of a grip on the community, letting no security flaw go unfixed. 

Which is why I'm writing this, to express how sad I am to see the jailbreak scene fade away. It makes me lose all hope in ever jailbreaking my shiny new iPhone 5 :P

I'm not the type to jump boat to the Android scene, iOS devices are in my opinion at least, are a lot easier to use. 

Should I stay patient and wait on the teams, or give in to Apple's clutches?

[Current work in progress.](http://i.imgur.com/2QBRnsB.png)

Hey - back with an update. 

* Added non-emoji keyboards
* Added dictation images
* Added numberpad images
* Added a white popup key variant
* Realigned almost all the elements 
* Resized some of the popup keys
* Fixed 'ABC' text being too high on a few keyboards

*The shift key issue that has been pointed out cannot be fixed!*

Also, I have added all the PSDs to the download. However, after making the first version free last time and banking on donations, less than 3% of the people who downloaded donated. Not a big deal - but because of that I feel that all the PSDs and the updated keyboard elements are at least worth $.99! Even if the PSDs are of no use to you, I still think $.99 is very fair. 

This will let all the people who requested tiny little changes (i.e. lower case letters, slight color change, support for other languages, etc.) to do it themselves or have someone they know do it. I simply do not have time with finals coming up to be able to deliver on that type of promise. 

**Important: if you already paid / donated any amount, please send me a PM with your name and email and I will send you the update for free. I have a list of the people who did.** 

*I know me saying this won't matter at all, but please do not distribute the PSDs. I worked pretty hard on them.*

I come from an Android background. I had an iPhone 3GS back in the day that was jailbroken, but for two years after I had an HTC Inspire and  Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. I rooted those and had fun playing with them. Developers had to work not only to root these devices (as the dev team and now the evaders do), but also to build custom firmwares for them and code applications for them. 

And the vast majority of them were free. These developers worked for donations, and some even refused to accept donations except to purchase new devices to code and test on. Coming back to the iPhone, everything is quite the opposite - Half of the tweaks on the Cydia store are paid, and many of them are excessively expensive. For example, I could get any number of tethering apps on my SGS2 Skyrocket for free. There were an abundance of them. MyWi costs $20 for a full license. I could tweak the UI with tons of neat things. Even UI tweaks like Auxo cost money on the iPhone. 

Why is the developer culture so different for jailbroken devices compared with Android devices? As a poor teenager it irks me that I don't have the same sort of potential with my iPhone as I did with my Android phone and it really makes me want to switch back. "	t5_2r8c5	True

So I've been noticing that the majority of this subreddit is just a bunch of submissions of people who don't know how to jailbreak their phones asking someone to tell them how to do it. Well, guys, learning how to do it yourself and taking the time to research what to do and not do will save you a hell of a lot of hassle later. Check out a few of these sites before posting so we know you've done your homework.

This is a big list of terminology so n00bs can understand what everyone is talking about. If you don't know a word look it up here. 

http://blog.iphone-dev.org/
This is the iPhone dev team's blog which is updated with whatever they've currently released. They explain which phones and firmwares their jailbreak will work on.

Another site similar to the dev team's blog. 

http://www.iclarified.com/tutorials/iphone/index.php
Here is a collection of tutorials for jail breaking and beyond. If you need to know how to do something this is a good place to start. 

http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/04/always-up-to-date-guide-to-jailbreaking-your-ios-device-ios-4-3-1/
Even though I hate Gizmodo this page is updated pretty well with the newest untethered jailbreak (if you don't know what that means head up to the first link.)

http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/
This site allows you to download different/older firmwares for your device. Occasionally useful. 

Well, I hope some of these sites help you guys. Good luck!"	t5_2r8c5	True

1372456369.0	1h9xlh	[Meta] Should tweak and theme devs be given custom flair?	hizinfiz	83	9	40	"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/1h78o1/subreddit_idea_and_oc_tag/) was brought up yesterday. It's not immediately clear to me from that post whether or not this was a popular idea (since we don't get reasons why upvotes/downvotes are given and there aren't many comments).

**So to ask again**

&gt; Should we assign custom flair to jailbreak tweak and theme devs?

&gt; Is this something that is even necessary?

&gt; At least personally, I think that most people on /r/jailbreak know which redditors are jailbreak devs and which aren't. So I don't know how much of an added benefit this would be. But after briefly communicating with /u/insanj and /u/angelXwind, they believe that it would be beneficial (since apparently they still get asked if they're who they say they are).

&gt; This would be something that only a mod can grant, so random users can't masquerade as devs and give themselves flair (eg /u/pod2g).

&gt; It would have two main uses:

&gt; * A sort of ""verified"" status, so people know who is who
&gt; * A way to give recognition to those who have contributed to the community

**What would it look like?**

&gt; It would be something very simple, nothing in your face. (like [this](http://i.imgur.com/aKQ5yy3.png))

&gt; In the future, we may expand it to include a tweak or theme that the user has released on mouseover (similar to the way /r/iPhone handles flair)

**Who would get it?**

&gt; * Any user that has released a free or paid jailbreak tweak or app. (eg /u/insanj, /u/maxkatzman, /u/magn2o, /u/jontelang, /u/rpetrich, /u/joshmtucker)
&gt; * Any user that runs a Cydia repo. (eg /u/angelXwind, /u/0ptimo, /u/kylematthews (thanks /u/Beta382))
&gt; * Any user who has released a complete free or paid theme on Cydia. (eg /u/whitebaron, /u/smellslikedoughnuts, /u/Xavier_32)
&gt; * Any user who has released a jailbreak tool. (eg /u/planetbeing, /u/saurik)

**Who would not get it?**

&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak blog or website.
&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak youtube channel.
&gt; * Someone who runs a jailbreak twitter/google+/other social media account.
&gt; * If you've released a theme on /r/iOSthemes, you'll get flair on /r/iOSthemes but not /r/jailbreak, unless you fall under the category above.

**Thoughts?**

EDIT: I installed it and it worked perfectly.

I noticed they changed the guide abit on the site to help with those who get errors. So I hope the translator still works as good as before.

Found this also if it will help someone.
