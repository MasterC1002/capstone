Lady: Do you drink?
Man: Yes

Lady: How much a day?
Man: 3 six packs

Lady: How much per six pack
Man: about $10.00

Lady: And how long have you been drinking?
Man: 15 years

Lady: So 1 six pack cost $10.00 and you have 3 six packs a day
which puts your spending each month at $900. In one year, it would be $10,800
correct?
Man: Correct

Lady: If in 1 year you spend $10,800 not accounting for inflation, the past
15 years puts your spending at $162,000 correct?
Man: Correct

Lady: Do you know that if you hadn't drunk, that money could have been put
in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound
interest for the past 15 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?

Man: Do you drink?
Lady: No

1340326359.0	vetnp	While you're still young, make a choice.  Don't be me.	stupidlyugly	310	43	60	"Hey kids, papa old man stu here.  So many of you have been so kind to tell me that I'm apparently the CA you aspire to be.  Well, let me tell you something.  Being me kinda sucks balls.  Here's why.

1)  I'm a fucking drunk.  Any of you who've drunk with me in person can attest that I will drink, and drink, and drink until I pass out, will wake up, start drinking again, and blow a .15 late in the morning.  I'm not a young kid anymore, and I can't express to you enough how painful the hangovers are now.  They last 2, sometimes 4 days.

It's not much funny anymore to get shitshow drunk.  It's rather somewhat pathetic to see a 40-year-old man stumbling around, unable to say his own name, and pissing off everyone around him.

But I accept that I am, and always will be a drunk.  Unfortunately, the consequences are going to continually outgrow the benefits.  

2)  I'm really quite functioning.  Hold down a decent job, raise a kid, pay the bills, great credit score, a criminal record so nominal as to not even scare away the fine folk in accounting (who, by the way, wrote me up with HR in my employee evaluation for using my pen too loudly at my desk).

But see, here's the thing.  It's fucking miserable balancing these two things.  I'm really not drinking much right now because I'm in hard core CPA exam study mode, which adds a good four hours to my day after work.  This process is going to take a year to complete.  

So, during the non-drinking days, I feel like shit.  When the physical sickness is gone, then the nightmares begin, and brother, I'm telling you, these are like worldwide Armageddon is totally my fault and my dead mother laughs at me for my failures type nightmares.  

So I don't sleep.  Then I go to work, hung over, tired, and the anxiety attacks kick in.  I can't breath.  There is a weight pressing from inside my chest.  The sound of other peoples' keyboards incite internal paranoia that they're out to take my life away (and given the pen remarks, they just might be).

So this is my advice to you while you're still young enough to choose.  Either be a drunk or don't be a drunk.  If you're gonna be a drunk, embrace the poverty, but the freedom of movement and responsibility that comes with that poverty.  Get a shitty job that pays just enough to share a room in a shady mobile home, drink 211, smoke cigarettes, and enjoy the ride as long as you possibly can.

But Jesus, if you're gonna take on the whole lot of responsibilities that society deems necessary, realize that it's possible to pull off, but god damn is it not fun.  You'll spend 80% of your time stressed the fuck out and the other 20% of the time counting the minutes until you can drink and get away with it.

I'm gonna try really hard to spend the next ten years making as much money as possible, not buy a house, kick the kid out to college, pay for that, then disappear from this corporate grid, cuz fuck shit god damn hell, the alcohol isn't going to kill me.  The anxiety of living amongst the teetotalling normals is.  Of this I don't joke.  It's seriously going to kill me.

I've got a liver and a set of kidneys made of god damn alchemy metals, but I'm wound tighter than a nun's cunt in medieval Switzerland lost in a dark winter blizzard, and it's getting bad.  Real bad.

Cheers, fuckers."	t5_2s68b	True

1335391590.0	sshri	I met my ex-wife's new boyfriend this morning.	Lookmanospaces	297	31	106	"So, I'm out riding my bike around the lake this morning before the pub opens, and I pass another guy on his bike who happens to be one of the cops called to my apartment last weekend (long story).

""Oh, hey,"" he says as we stop.

""How's it going?"" I say.

""I had the weirdest conversation with this girl I'm seeing about you.""

So, apparently, a couple of days after my meeting him (while he was in uniform), he's on a date with his new girlfriend, and tells a funny story about being called on a report of a deranged man throwing bacon at a tree, but it turned out he was just drunk and trying to feed bacon to a hawk in the aforementioned tree.

""God, that sounds like something my ex-husband would do,"" says the girlfriend.

""What does your ex look like?"" he asks.

""Like Michael Fassbender, only with glasses and a goatee, and maybe a couple of extra pounds,"" she presumably replies.

So, they narrow this deranged, bacon-throwing drunk down to someone who looks just like me and happens to live in my condo complex.  Then they have a good laugh about what a small world it is, and he starts to feel inadequate about how much shorter and funnier-looking he is than I, but that's ok, because he gets to carry a gun to make up for having a small, misshapen penis.

After he tells me this story, we have a good laugh about what a small world it is, and I compliment him on finding such a pleasantly-casual way to say he's fucking my wife.

I enjoy the brief look of terror and embarrassment on his face as we go on our way, and resolve to spend the rest of the week thinking of snide remarks to make at his expense when I take my ex-sister-in-law out for a birthday brunch this coming Sunday.

**TLDR:**  I need to move.  This city is way too fucking small."	t5_2s68b	True

1311747989.0	j0xj2	That oh shit moment.	F_E_A_T	315	64	37	"So I work at a software company. It's corporate and pretty straitlaced. I share an office with three other dudes.

We had a problem with gnats, and one of my coworkers claimed leaving a cup of bourbon out attracts and then drowns them. So he decides to make a run to the liquor store. Everyone pitches in.

He comes back later with a gym bag packed with liquor. There must have been 5 or 6 separate bottles. Needless to say, no bourbon was set out for the gnats, we close our office door, and and within about 45 minutes I chug a 375 of Canadian LTD. The guy who made the run (in his mid 30s, sort of up-tight and a staunch Republican) gets pretty sloppy fairly quickly and starts rambling about doing anal.

Suddenly there's a knock at the door. I open it to find our HR Director. I watch his eyes fall on the duffel bag packed with plainly visible distinctive paper-bag ensconced bottles.

He walks over to the duffel bag, and grabs a fifth of Canadian Mist.

And then says ""Thanks for picking this up, [Name of the dude who made the run]"". And then takes a big swig.

And not a single fuck was given that day.

TL;DR: This is prime material for a rage comic, except I'm not 15. Also a fairly long post, for which I am non-apologetic. DEAL WITH IT.

I mostly sub for a woman who is on maternity leave (physics) but when I am not in her classes, I get put into other subjects for teachers who call in sick. Today I had to teach Health class to a bunch of 9th graders. I felt like I was in the fucking Twilight Zone. I handed out some true/false worksheets for them that asked basic questions like ""is alcohol addicting?"" and ""does body weight affect your level of intoxication?"". Then they had to answer a bunch of questions about drugs and alcohol out of their textbooks. What a fucking trip! I would walk around to make sure they were working and not texting on their phones. You know, typical sub shit. Kids would ask me ""Mr. SoandSo, what are the symptoms of alcohol abuse?"". In my head, the last 10 or so years of my life were flashing before me but all I was really ""allowed to say"" was ""addiction, liver damage, and mental health problems"". 

Basically, I was sweating (literally) like a whore in church and I knew you fuckers would get some sort of kick out of it. Cheers. 

EDIT: thanks for the CA love. Your karma makes my miserable life a little less miserable and then more miserable again.

On my way home I think I bought some prescriptions off a dude in the subway. Next thing I remember is meeting a girl while smoking a cig outside the airport, then buying plane tickets laid out on the floor on the white courtesy telephone. 

Came to in the tiny middle seat in a shitty airplane surrounded by assholes eating their ridiculous packaged lunches. I rang the bell and bought a gin and tonic and passed out again. 

Woke up again when the plane hit the Tarmac. Left the airport in a daze following the girl I was apparently traveling with, hopped on a train, transferred to the NYC subway in the miserable underground stench of penn station, passed out again, got out and got some fresh air in Brooklyn. 

Stopped at the nearest taco shop and ordered chips and tequila. Lots of tequila. I felt a lot more like myself after a couple drinks, and set off on foot towards Barclays center. Traded some cigs for a beer with some street kids on the way there and went into the center to see the show.

That's just the sign that it hurts too much to be sober. One day, the point comes when the alcohol just doesn't help enough, when the body can't handle enough alcohol to forget; when nature finally admits that death is the only release from the hell we live daily.

Sine moving to the USA I still order a beer with lunch. Just did this on a date with a nice girl and she was all like ""do you always drink this early"" (it was noon). 

Okay sure, I am a CA so she's not off the point, but I just didn't expect this sort of things to throw up red flags.

Of course I had about 6 shots before even picking her up for lunch (and I am assuming you all realize this is barely enough to get me buzzed) and I order a beer as-per-usual with my lunch. 

Literally every male in Germany gets a beer with lunch...you would be looked at weird if you ordered a Pepsi. 

I used my German heritage to try and explain myself but shit. 

We need to change the social culture around here to accept this. It seems to me that any drinking before 5 (i.e. before work ends) is just unacceptable around here.

And it's not like Germany is filled with alcoholics. We probably have the same percentage as the states. But drinking at noon is the fucking norm. This needs to happen in America. It would be better for everyone.

First off, while the cars behind me were pretty fucked up, and one woman got carted off in an ambulance with a bump the size of a baseball on her head, the damage to my car is hardly even visible cosmetic shit that I won't even bother to fix if I have to pay a deductible, and I suffered no physical injury whatsoever.  My biggest concern is getting ambulance chased, so I took extensive preemptive action to prevent that.

Anyhoo....The police ran my license, my insurance, my license plates, my registration sticker, my inspection sticker, and my VIN.  All that was going through my mind was, ""Thank God I'm sober right now, and thank God I don't have any warrants I'm unaware of.""

You can be the best drunk driver on the planet, but you can't control what other people on the road do.  Even in the most innocent of circumstances, you can find yourself sandwiched between two cars (of suspiciously related parties) with the police asking you uncomfortable questions.

Don't do it kids.  Drink at home, at walking distance bars, or in areas with cabs/buses/trains.

I'm not going to say they aren't annoying as hell, because they are, but I get it. You want to experience and discuss what you are drinking on a different level, right? It's good to dust off the ol' taste buds every once in awhile. And hey, what the hell? Beer has a taste that can be explored and discussed. Even the Big Three American brews (and I use the term loosely, we all know none of them are American-owned any more) taste like *something*. (Corn and piss are things, after all, aren't they?) So if it makes you happy, why not? Go ahead, Analyze your ale, inspect your IPA, pontificate over your porter. 

But *vodka snobs*? Vodka is tasteless by design. When they make vodka they start with a wort of fermented grain (which, sadly, has potential at that point) and then they distill it to 180°. They distill the fucking *life* out of it. Then, just in case there is some semblance of character left in the inebriant, they filter it. Three, four, *five or more times* in some cases. Then they add water to this soulless spirit. Presto-booze-o! 

Anyone who thinks their vodka tastes like something other than ethanol and water are full of shit. ""This new vodka, Rape My Pocketbook, has an earthy nose, a slightly viscous mouth feel, and finishes with bison grass and a hint of lilac!"" No, it doesn't. If your bullshit, absurdly-indulgent artisanal quaff tastes like that it is because some dipshit forgot to clean the filters last week. That *je ne sais quoi* you are fawning over? It's black mold. Yeah, it would kill you if you inhaled it, but you will gladly pay $40+ a bottle because some rap song and a full page ad in Maxim told you to, because you are so fucking sophisticated. I would wish that all vodka snobs choke on their own vomit and die at some point, but they won't, they don't even drink the shit properly. ""Nah, bro, it's a sippin' vodka.""

The 86 Rules of Boozing:

1. If you owe someone money, always pay them back in a bar. Preferably during happy hour.

2. Always toast before doing a shot.

3. Whoever buys the shot gets the first chance to offer a toast.

4. Change your toast at least once a month.

5. Buying someone a drink is five times better than a handshake.

6. **Buying a strange woman a drink is still cool. Buying all her drinks is dumb.** 

7. Never borrow more than one cigarette from the same person in one night.

8. When the bartender is slammed, resist the urge to order a slightly dirty, very dry, in-and-out, super-chilled, half-and-half martini with a lemon twist. Limit orders to beer, straight shots, and two part cocktails.

9. Get the bartenders attention with eye contact and a smile.

10. **Do not make eye contact with the bartender if you do not want a drink.**

11. Unacceptable things to say after doing a shot: ""Great, now I'm going to get drunk."" ""I hate shots."" ""It's coming back up.""

12. Never ever tell a bartender he made your drink too strong.

13. If he makes it too weak, order a double the next time. He'll get the message.

14. If you offer to buy a woman a drink and she refuses, she does not like you.

15. If you offer to buy a woman a drink and she accepts, she still might not like you. 

16. If she buys you a drink, she likes you.

17. If someone offers to buy you a drink, do not upgrade your liquor preference.

18. Always keep a corkscrew in your house.

19. If you don't have a corkscrew, push the cork down into the bottle with a pen.

20. **Drink one girly drink in public and you will forever be known as the guy who drinks girly drinks.**

21. Our parents were better drinkers than we are.

22. Never talk to someone in the restroom unless you're doing the same thing - Urinating, waiting in line, or washing your hands.

23. Girls hang out, apply makeup, and have long talks in the bathroom. Men do not.

24. **After your sixth drink, do not look at yourself in the mirror. It will shake your confidence.**

25. It is only permissible to shout ""woo-hoo!"" if you are doing a shot with four or more people.

26. If there is a DJ, you can request a song only once per night. If he doesn't play it within half an hour, do not approach him again. If he does play it, do not approach him again.

27. Learn how to make a rose out of a bar napkin. You'll be surprised how well it works.

28. If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to drink at a bar. Go to the liquor store.

29. If you owe someone twenty dollars or less, you may pay them back in beer.

30. **Never complain about quality or brand of a free drink.**

31. If you have been roommates with someone more than six months, you may drink his beer, even if it's hidden, so long as you leave him one.

32. You can sneak a shot of your roommate's liquor only if the bottle is cracked and it is less than $25.

33. The only thing that tastes better than free liquor is stolen liquor.

34. If you bring cheap beer to a party, you must drink at least 2 cans before you start drinking the imported beer in the fridge.

35. Learn to appreciate hangovers. If it was all good times every jackass would be doing it.

36. If you ever feel depressed, get out a bartender's guide and browse through all the drinks you've never tried. 

37. Try a new drink each week.

38. If you are the bar's sole customer, you are obliged to make small talk with the bartender until he stops acknowledging you. Then you're off the hook. Same goes for him.

39. Never tip with coins that have touched you. If your change is $1.50, you can tell the barmaid to keep the change, but once she has handed it to you, you cannot give it back. To a bartender or cocktail waitress, small change has no value.

40. If you have ever told a bartender ""Hey, it all spends the same."" then you are a cheap ass.

41. Anyone on stage or behind a bar is 50% better looking.

42. You can tell how hard a drinker someone is by how close they keep their drink to their mouth.

43. A bar is a college, not a nursery. If you spill a beer, clean it up. If you break a glass, wait for a staff member to clean it up, then blame it on someone else.

44. Being drunk is feeling sophisticated without being able to say it.

45. **It's okay to drink alone.**

46. After 3 drinks, you will forget a woman's name 2 seconds after she tells you. The rest of the night you will call her ""baby"" or ""darling"".

47. Nothing screams ""nancy boy"" louder than swirling an oversized brandy snifter.

48. Men don't drink from straws. Unless you're doing a mind eraser or face eraser.

49. If you do a shot, finish it. If you don't plan to finish it, don't accept it.

50. Never brood in a dance bar. Never dance in a dive bar.

51. Never play more than 3 songs by the same artist in a row.

52. Never yell out jukebox selections to someone you don't know.

53. Your songs will come on as you're leaving the bar.

54. Never lie in a bar. You may, however, grossly exaggerate and lean.

55. **If you think you might be slurring a little, you're slurring a lot. If you think you're slurring a lot, then you are not speaking English.**

56. Screaming ""someone buy me a drink!"" has never worked.

57. For every drink, there is a 5% better chance you will get in a fight. There is also a 3% better chance you will lose the fight.

58. Fighting an extremely drunk person when you are sober is hilarious.

59. If you are broke and your friend is ""sporting you,"" you must laugh at all his jokes and play wingman when he makes his move.

60. If you are broke and a friend is ""making sport of you,"" you may steal any drink he leaves unattended. 

61. Never rest your head on a tabletop or bar. It is the equivalent of voluntarily putting your head on a chopping block.

62. If you are trading rounds with a friend and he asks if you are ready for another, always say yes. Once you fall out of sync, you will end up buying more drinks than him.

63. If you are going to hit on a member of the bar staff, make sure you tip well before and after, regardless of his or her response.

64. **The people with the most money are rarely the best tippers.**

65. Before you die, single handedly make one decent martini. 

66. Asking the bartender what beers are on tap when the handles are right in front of you is the equivalent of saying ""I'm an idiot.""

67. Never ask a bartender, ""What's good tonight?"" They do not fly in the scotch fresh from the coast every morning.

68. If there is a line for drinks, get your goddamn drink and step the hell away from the bar.

69. If there is ever any confusion, the fuller beer is yours.

70. **The patrons at your local bar are your extended family, your fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters. Except you get to sleep with these sisters, and if you're really drunk, the mothers.**

71. It's acceptable - Traditional, in fact - to disappear during a night of hard drinking. You will appear mysterious and your friends will understand. If they even notice.

72. Never argue your tab at the end of the night. Remember, you're hammered and they're sober. 99.9% of the time you're wrong, and either way you're going to come off as a jackass.

73. If you bring booze to a party, you must drink it or leave it.

74. **If you hesitate more than 3 seconds after the bartender looks at you, you do not deserve a drink.**

75. Beer makes you mellow, champagne makes you silly, and tequila makes you felonious.

76. The greatest thing a drunkard can do is buy a round of drinks for a packed bar.

77. Never preface a conversation with a bartender with ""I know this is going to be hassle, but...."" 

78. When you're in a bar and drunk, your boss is just another guy begging for a fat lip. Unless he's buying.

79. If you're 86'd, do not return for at least 3 months. To come back sooner makes it appear no other bar wants you.

80. Anyone with 3 or more drinks in his hand has the right of way.

81. If you're going to drink on the job, drink vodka. It's the no-tell liquor.

82. **There's nothing wrong with drinking before noon. Especially if you're supposed to be at work.**

83. The bar clock moves twice as fast from midnight to last call.

84. A flask engraved with a personal message is one of the best gifts you can ever give. And make sure there's something in it.

85. On the intimacy scale, sharing a quiet drink is between a handshake and a kiss.

86. You will forget every one of these rules by your fifth drink.

Some people are confused how a bunch of alcoholics that appear to be destroying their life can be so kind and supportive to each other.  To me, it makes perfect sense. It's what makes CA so special.  We're a subgroup of people that society looks down on.  People judge us, call us out, say we're destroying our lives, wasting time in a bottle, begging us to seek help, as if we want their acceptance.  

Now we have our own home and with our user count over six thousand, it's clear we aren't alone in this world.  We all can accept each other and be who we want to be despite the fact that, yes, we define ourselves by our drinking.  We understand each other, and because of that we care about each other.  We're not bad people, we're just drunk people.  We're emotional people.  We're our own fucked up little family, and that's just fine with me.  

Cheers, you beautiful sons of bitches.

I have spent years in the back room drinking beers with him. He gave me a running tab that I would go and pay every friday. He was the first place I was allowed to buy from underage. Liquor stores close at 9pm here in Connecticut if I was working late or just late in general as long as I called before he closed up there would be a 30 pack or bottle that ""fell off the truck"" in the trash can behind the store. 

Goodbye tab,goodbye after hours service but most of all goodbye companionship. Although he was always a buck or two more expensive than them super mega mart package stores I was always greeted by name and we always shoot the shit..I wasnt just another faceless guy with $.

On a positive note he did offer me booze at CT state minimum   0% markup for the remainder of his time there..the people buying the store wanted to close this weekend but he hadn't gotten to break the news to his customers yet.

We are now well over 10,000 subscribers. I'm gonna be honest, most of those subscribers likely don't actually belong here, but I'm fine with that if they just want to read and occasionally contribute in a helpful, respectful manner. But there have been a lot of posts lately that have screamed karma whores, and new people that don't know what is relevant here and what isn't. We have our own etiquette that goes beyond reddiquette and you should be well aware of it prior to posting. 

Creating a detailed, helpful sidebar is not easy. It does not create itself. The mods put a lot of time and effort into making a side bar and the mods here have gone above and beyond to make our side bar as useful as absolutely possible. And you should all take advantage. I read the sidebar all the time. And still occasionally find something new as things are added.

Have other interests besides drinking yourself to death? Check out the ""related subs"" section. We have scores of interest-related subs you might like. 

The point is, the mods put in a lot of time and really hard work to make the sidebar as useful, and in your best interest as they possibly could, and it is - I feel - largely ignored.

Why is it acceptable for people to get pissed, hit someone, and then puke and pass out in a gutter whereas people who drink by themselves at home, listen to some good music, and pass out in their beds/baths are considered as lowlifes and losers?

So, my brother passed away recently. He'd just been released from rehab a few weeks ago, and I told him how proud I was over Steam chat. He said thanks and he logged off. He doesn't have a cell phone anymore since his job provided that and he lost that before the most recent session of rehab.

My mother called me in hysterics just a few hours ago. She found him lying in his bed, green and bloated, reeking of death. He lived alone, and had shrunk into a serious recluse who would interrogate anyone who came to knock on his door until they left. We've got no idea how long he'd been dead, but from the looks of it, at least a couple of weeks. 

We all said we'd check on him, and we all had that feeling, but life has too much shit to do, you know? He had already hit rock bottom and was clawing the rocks trying to find out how much deeper he could go. 

He'd lost his job and was scrounging money for booze. There's no telling if he killed himself or if his body finally blew up internally.

Now he's gone. I'll never see him again, and the funeral will by necessity be closed coffin.

Rum. Coke.

This is the worst possible way to deal with this.

And here I am falling off the wagon.

StuddedMohawk	150	27	42	"I don't really know where else this post belongs, but it's late and I really need to talk about it. It's almost 4am where I live now and I've been up all night suctioning the blood that my uncle has been spitting up periodically as he lay in his morphine induced coma. Me, my 3 cousins and my girlfriend are just waiting until he passes away. 

He was a huge partier, taught me how to drink when I was young. lived his life in the moment and had fun doing it. I love this man, in a lot of ways I look up to this man. He has a heart of gold.

We brought him to the hospital Thursday morning and hes been here ever since progressively getting worse. His body is swollen up like a balloon because the fluid has nowhere else to go. Earlier, he started spitting up blood and even spit up what looked like pieces of his liver. He grabbed his side and he started to cry from the pain. My entire family watched as he screamed for us to help him. We got his pain under control and that's when we made the decision to begin ""comfort treatment"". He's being given 7mg morphine/hr intravenously. He is asleep and it sounds like he's drowning from all the blood and fluid he's inhaled. The most heart breaking thing is there's nothing we can do but wait for him to asphyxiate. He snapped put of it for one second when we all said we loved him, he replied, ""I love all of you too, but I can't do this anymore. It hurts too much"".

literally watching my uncle die in such a painful way makes me consider my own CA. I never wish this upon anyone. It is such a horrible way to go... 

Idk if the mods will take this down or not, like I said I didn't know where else to put it and I just really wanted to talk about it. Please PLEASE take one shot for my uncle Gene. Just a shot in his name, for he was too, a cripplingalcoholic. I will miss him so much.

EDIT: My uncle Gene has just passed away. Please join me in a cheers to his life.

I work at a tiny Chinese restaurant in a strip mall.  I've been there two months and put in 40 to 50 hours a week.  90% of the time I'm the only person there who speaks English.  I get paid under the table, and my bosses still haven't learned my full name.  We communicate a few words at a time/in impromptu sign language, and I deal with the customers.  It's pretty chill, I guess.

On a normal day I'll take a half pint to keep the shakes at bay and keep my interactions with customers pleasant.  Yesterday I exercised some bad judgement and said ""fuck it, let's do a pint and a half and I'll have some left over.""  I had none left over.  By the end of my shift I was noticeably tanked.  I came in the next day expecting to get chewed out but instead my bosses are laughing in Chinese and shit, all ""you like drink man?  hahaha he drink all time!""  Then the owner went in the back and handed me a beer (Tsingtao) from his personal stash and said ""you work hard today ok?""

1345419871.0	yhuca	"Something I wrote down about that question, ""What is it like being an alcoholic?"""	BigBoss722	137	14	42	"Many of my friends have asked me, ""What is it like being an alcoholic?"" Well, it's certainly not that simple. You see, every alcoholic is different and has different drinking habbits. For me? It went something like this... 

When I first started drinking. I started drinking hard. It was right after my father had passed away. I was pretty much trying to be a desperate alcoholic, maybe to get closer to him in some sort of sick way. You see he died of liver failure. He was an alcoholic. 

That phase passed. Normal life resumed. I met a girl, was somewhat happy. 

Then I started drinking once or twice a week. I went to the bar with friends, you know how that goes. My friends had their two to four drinks. I had nine. I was a party animal. The life of the party. 

That was the thing to do at that age though. Go to the bar, get drunk, get home, pass out. I never was the designated driver because I was honest with my friends. I told them what's the point of going to the bar if I'm not going to get fucked up? They wanted the life of the party with them,  so they never bothered me about driving. That's what we did every week.  My friends and I gathered around alcohol every week. 

Gone were the days of casual video games til 2am. Now it was the bar til 2am and those drunken trips to Denny's I barely remember. I didn't miss the under 21 routine though. This one was much more interesting. 

Then one designated drinking night, everyone had other plans. “Well fuck that.” I still planned on drinking. I figured I'd save a ton of money by just buying some stuff for the house, instead of paying bar prices. It was okay though. I wasn't an alcoholic. I wasn't going to do this kind of thing every night. It was just a one time thing. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary, I wasn't breaking the law. Just having a good time. 

Before I knew it. I was drinking every night I had off. 

But I wasn't an alcoholic. 

Life resumed, and almost without me even realizing it, I was drinking every night I could. As much as I could. Hangovers became the normal me. I learned to recover very quickly from hangovers when I had responsibilities the next day. Gatorade, something small to eat, water, coffee, cigarettes. I still wasn't an alcoholic though. Those guys drink every day all day. 

Then one day my boss told me I smelled like alcohol. I was asked if I had been drinking. It was still early in the morning. I drank a ton the night before. I told him I had been drinking the night before, but would never drink at work. I was proud of the fact I didn't drink during the day time. He took my word for it, and let it slide. 

My friends didn't know how much I was drinking. Hell I didn't ask them how much they were drinking. Why would I? I wasn't bothering anyone. I wasn't in anyones way. I wasn't making any problems for others. 

I started to notice I was thinking of everything in drinks. If one of my friends suggested doing something I would always mention drinking or playing a drinking game. I started to pick out what people were drinking in movies and on television. I could tell you how to make anything mentioned in a movie. If I couldn't. I looked it up. Knowing I would try it when I could. 

I started to wonder if I was an alcoholic.  “No way.”

Then one day I woke up late for work. Really late this time.  I didn't remember much of anything of the night before. I checked my phone to see a few texts that read, ""LOL"". A few phone calls I didn't really remember making. 

I realized it was time to stop drinking on the weekdays. It was time to focus. It was Friday though! I wasn't going to waste the weekend. I decided I would stop drinking Sunday. I wasn't going to waste any drinking days. Again, I started to wonder if I was an alcoholic. 

Sunday came faster than a blink of an eye it seemed. I told myself Sunday was still technically part of the weekend, and I would just have a few before bed. Waking up Monday morning I discovered I had pissed somewhere in the house. A few things were broken. I checked my bank account. No good. I spent money I shouldn't have at the beer store. 

At lunch on Monday I started thinking about drinking again. I knew I shouldn't. I knew I couldn't afford it. Well I ended up stopping at the liquor store on the way home. I knew the people in there. I felt it was a safe place. I told myself just one more night of this. It was the last weekday I'd be drinking on for a long, long time. 

Weeks passed and I didn't skip a beat. I got drunk every single night. Some nights I got more drunk than others, but I certainly got drunk. I began justifiying my drinking based on other people. I wasn't as bad as ""THAT"" guy. I didn't scream at anyone, or get violent. I kept  current on my bills. I didn't break the law. I never drove drunk. I wasn't out on the corner buying drugs. ""I'm a great person."", I told myself.

Finally I had that moment of clarity alcoholics always talk about. Maybe it took running out of money to eat, or a pain in my side I couldn't explain, but I knew this time I'd really stop. At least for the time being. It was also around this time I realized I was an alcoholic. You don't have to drink twenty four hours a day to be an alcoholic.

The first night I wasn't drinking I had no idea what to do with myself. I was so bored. I felt like I needed to treat myself for not drinking this night. So I went and got take out at a restaurant. I got home and felt very depressed. Anti social. I just wanted to be left alone. I didn't want to talk to any of my friends. I had no interest in anything. ""Fuck the world."", I thought. 

My brain did an amazing job of letting me know it would rather be drunk. Every... minute... of... the... day. No matter what I was doing, whether it was cutting my nails, watching a movie, listening to music, driving to the store, anything..

As I lied down to go to sleep that first night, my legs would spasm randomly. I couldn't sleep for shit. If only I was drunk, I'd sleep like a baby. But I wasn't. I woke up midway though the night covered in sweat. (It wasn't until later I found out these are all signs of alcohol withdraw. You see I never got the shakes bad, or anything like that, because I never drank 24-7. I always woke up, drank my gatorade, coffee, food, cigarettes. You know, sober up.)

The second night was more of the same. Another twitch, another pain. More sweating. More fucking boredom. 

The week seemed to drag on, and on. I was desperately bored. Miserable. Everything got on my nerves. I mean everything. Little things I didn't normally let bother me if I was driving to the liquor store. During that time though? Every minor inconvienience was like the end of the world. It's hard to describe that feeling in words.  

I was on my fifth day of sobreity. My mind had finally cleared. I wasn't experiencing any pains, sweatiness, trouble sleeping, twitches, etc. I was super proud of myself too! Five days straight. Even more proud that I survived the boredom. Maybe this was the turnaround. 

Then I realized it was pay day. It was time to reward myself with alcohol. Hell, why not? I was sober for five whole days.


tl;dr: Piss.

1332372216.0	r7if5	Review: Budweiser Tall Boy 6-pack, one 24 oz. Earthquake &amp; Three Airplane Bottles of Jim Beam Black	DevilWorshipper	131	17	20	"I occasionally browse r/scotch and get a kick out of some of the reviews they do of obscure and/or expensive scotches, so, figured I'd do a review of my typical evening.

This particular combo is my goto routine 3-4 nights a week. It's dirt cheap and packs a good whallop and gets me a wonderful 5-6 hours of unconscious bliss.

The Bud is $5.99 a sixer at the gas station down the street, a full two dollars less than any other store in town. It opens with a crisp sssshhhtuck! The first few gulps are cold and sometimes put a weird, temporary tightening sensation in my upper-chest. There are subtle overtones of roofing work and lawnchair in the taste and the can allows for a good, steady pull. The last few drops are tasteless backwash, but, there may still be some alcohol left, so, doesn't matter. The can crushes nicely, lending a manly aspect to the brew. The first two go down within 20 minutes and now it's time for the EQ.

At $1.29 and 8.1%, the EQ is a great supplemental bargain and a wonderful way to kickstart the ensuing intoxication. The overwhelming flavors are rubbing alcohol and failure and, while not quite as easy to pull as the Bud, it goes down quickly enough. After 15 minutes the EQ is kaput.

After years of bitter experience I have learned that I simply cannot have large bottles of distilled spirits around the house. I'm sure some of you can appreciate this, so, we move into phase II. 

The airplane bottles of Jim Beam are $1.50 at the state run liquor store, a little pricey, but the stuff is worth it. Poured neat into a rocks glass, the liquid is golden and rich. Paired with Bud #3, I sip some beer before drinking the shot. The shot is warm, serious, and tastes like a cross between heaven and NASCAR. When it is done, another good slug of the beer and it's time to relax and watch Family Guy reruns and 30 Rock instead of the political shit I've been reading on the internet all day. Why does sobriety make me believe that being informed and having an opinion means anything? Fuck if I know. Thank god for booze.

The third and forth Buds last a good hour or so and then it's time for another shot. Fifth beer lasts a good 40 minutes. I'm officially fucked-up at this point and much of the alcohol has yet to be processed and reach my bloodstream. I crack beer #6 and spend a long, loving hour or more with it, basking in the warm embrace of an ever-increasing BAC. Time for bed. The sun is still out. Fuck it, I'm drunk and don't have shit to do or anywhere to go. Time for the final shot. 

All in all, I give the Bud, EQ and Beam recipe a solid four out of five stars in terms of cost, ease of drink, drinking pleasure, and, most importantly, ability to put me down and shut my head off for a few hours.

I hate when people talk about ""hoppiness"" or how anti-establishment they are by only drinking locally-brewed, small-time, fair-trade, hipster beer. I hate people who want to lecture you on how corporations are killing america because I ordered a half price budweiser. I always just want to say ""Hey guess what fuckface, I don't give a shit if you think busch light tastes like water, stop being a little judgmental piece of shit and leave me alone.""

A nice tasting beer is great, but when I'm drinking, taste is the last thing I'm concerned with. I'm drinking for one reason: I want to feel normal, and a bottle of bud does the trick just as well as your independent, microbrew, anti-establishment, super-uniquie and ultra-flavorful IPA.

There is a bar / brewery RIGHT across the street from my house. When I moved in I thought this would be perfect.. a 2 minute walk from a popular bar with a young crowd, but its full of assholes swirling their beer goblets and talking about the aromas and shit.

It's my birthday and I knew everyone I care about is alienated or dead so I really didn't pull out any stops. Anyway 745, work at 800, call a cab and head into work. If I had half a brain I wouldn't. I pretend I'm sober and do okay for a while - than my boss calls me into the back to talk to me. 

I go back and sit down with him, getting ready for the talk - again. In the room is sitting a bottle of Jim Beam, and a tray of shot glasses poured. Now I go to great lengths to hide my birthday - but a chick at work knew my dad. 

We all slammed back about 3 shots a piece than drank throughout the day because this week was slow anyway. Most of the lightweights fucked shit up a lot worse than I did all day. 

Anyway I can't believe I didn't friggen get fired. They couldn't even smell the booze that much because they got an early start. I didn't even notice crap was going on because I was staring at my cutting board with 100% attention on the damn potatoes while everyone else was waiting in the back room to get sloshed. 

It was some fluke that this even happened - tonight I'm going to be a good boy and get like maybe 3 hours of sleep before tommorrows shift so I dont get canned. Damn man.

Anyway cheers fuckers - we all get lucky sometimes. 

(Also got cake and AAA steaks - boss is dead serious about being cool to employees around the holidays and birthdays)

Edit: Literally the luck has made my day, I've never been so damn relieved/happy. My dad is losing his apartment and has to move in with me because he's been fucking up bad too. I thought I really fucked up by going into work, this is one of the biggest breaks I ever caught.

1353920618.0	13t08g	This is a few days late, but... thanks.	tourdefranz	132	18	23	"I originally meant to write this on Thanksgiving day, but slept until 6 PM and missed my family dinner.

I just want to say thanks to all of you for guiding me to the HFA lifestyle in the past year. You've brought me from someone who would beg his friends to buy him drinks at whatever bar they felt like going to into a person who's managing a bar, managing to get drunk on his shift while still making a good amount of money and finally moving into my own place that still facilitates an easy (6 foot) commute to work. 

The story goes like this-

I had been unemployed for a long time, searching for a place to work in Omaha when an acquaintance of mine told me she would buy my drinks that night at a bar a block away from my mother's floor (a.k.a. home at that point.) We go in, I get poorly made drinks all night and get half a buzz.

A week or so later I'm sitting on my mother's toilet (where I could get wifi signal to get on chat and talk to you fucks) and Val reminds me that I need to grab beer before last call. I realize I have enough for a drink or two plus package to go, so I head into the bar. The owner is covering for a fuckup bartender that he's kept in the business for some reason. He serves me a double Jameson on the rocks in a martini glass towering with ice with only one shot of whiskey in it, and I tell him ""this is really rocky, and pretty dry."" 

He responds by saying ""Well where did you learn how to bartend?""

I say ""5 years working at a 70 year old bar, where did you learn to bartend?""

""I went to bartending college."" he said snidely.

""Did you skip the day where they told you an order on the rocks is 8 cubes and a double shot?""

""Where did you learn how to bartend?""

""At a 70 year old bar for 5 years. Jameson on the rocks is a man's drink, it's not an appletini, it's not fruity, it's what men drink to get drunk to forget the fact that they're paying 7 bucks for this shitty pour.""

""What's your name?""

""Alex Franz. I live a block away.""

""I'm Jesse. Good to meet you."" And he didn't charge me for that drink and ended up buying me another.

Fast-forward 2 hours and 3 drinks on the house later, I learn from Jesse that his bartender is outside counting his tips and wanting to close with a house of 40 patrons at midnight. Jesse is reasonably incensed at this fact, and storms inside the bar yelling ""DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW HOW TO BARTEND?!""

I raise my hand slowly and say ""I'm also unemployed!""

Jesse grabs me by the arm and drags me to the back patio where he informs the slacker bartender that I'm his replacement.

This is getting lengthy and we're all drunk. I ended up working with Jesse for a few months, ended up as the bar manager with bosses who understand that I pour drinks and interact with people once my shakes are gone, but today I am 180 degrees from my beggar drunk self that I was in June. 

And CA is the reason.

If Val hadn't told me to go get more beer because I was running out, if Dork hadn't restored my faith in the world that people are people and some of us are habitual drunks, if all of you I haven't talked to on the phone and on Skype and on our horrible incestual family that is CA chat hadn't pushed me on and on and on I wouldn't be where I am now.

Managing a bar, controlling inventory, opening and closing every day of the week, making more money than I can spend, having an amazing girlfriend who accepts me for who I am, living on my own in an awesome studio apartment (where any of you can stay whenever you want to.) I never thought I could be a high functioning fucker, but you all believed in me just as you believe in everyone. 

The point of this post is to say thank you all. I am so in love with all of you. I kiss my /r/CA chip every day and it's never done me wrong. 

TL;DR- Thanks to all of you. You helped me become a real person.

You helped me clean the house. You helped me cook dinner. You always wanted to know what I was doing in the bathroom.

You never let me sleep in with a hangover. You never let me forget about your spot on the couch that I was sitting on.

You were the first one to greet me when I came home; good day or bad day.

You were always so concerned when I feel asleep in the wrong place. You let me know when I threw up in the wrong place.

I swear you warned me about calling Julie or Meaghan every night. 

You always loved me, and wanted to be loved by me. Ever since you were a kitten, you were right there. Always.

1373658645.0	1i6aic	"""We are born two drinks shy of happiness"""	MisterSleep	128	19	24	"Written by Gordon Keith 

Last week, 20-year-old [redacted] fell off the back of a party boat in the approaching darkness on Lake Ray Hubbard and no one noticed. Directionless and confused, the girl treaded water for two hours before a rescuer’s spotlight found her 200 yards from shore.

This weekend and every weekend after until the cold sobers us up, we’ll be out on our lakes with our plastic cups and leaking coolers chasing good times and navigating poor decisions. For most of us, life without alcohol doesn’t seem like much of a life. It’s what we do. We pair it with everything. A lake outing, a celebration, a defeat, a night out, a night in, a Christmas, a Memorial Day, a wedding, a Wednesday.

I got a promotion. Let’s have a drink.

I didn’t get the promotion. Let’s have a drink.

Alcohol is the prescription and the accepted response for all life’s experiences, even opposing ones. Part of this is cultural. But most of it’s human.

We are born two drinks shy of happiness. Two drinks gets you to what feels like the natural starting line of life. It’s a warm restoration. A velvet womb. Easy, free and a transceiver of love. But if you’re unlucky, it gets harder to hit that retreating target of two-drink contentment. Soon three is not enough and four is too many. Then five is not enough and six is too many. And so on. Managing the alchemy can be exhausting and futile.

When you’re young, sailor drinking is expected. In bikinis and frat houses, prodigious bouts of drinking result in proudly retold epics. But when you’re not young, but just want to feel that way, prodigious bouts are retold by loved ones that hush when you enter the room. You start off drinking out of the bottle and at some secret point it starts drinking out of you. It’s not everyone, but it’s enough.

If you’re at all self-aware, you know that something’s not right. The realization will be vague at first, when wine by the box is no longer a social embarrassment but a financial practicality, or when living room drinking has retreated to the garage.

We all know someone, and there’s nothing sadder than a pot-bellied man squeezing himself through a long neck searching for his inner high school. Or a child hoping that the wine runs out on a sentence-repeating mom. All that close talking and bitter breath should be reserved for office holiday parties anyway. Yet we hold a cultural conviction that drinking will always splash color on drab things. Cheeks, backyard cookouts, cove parties, love, marriage.

If he’s lucky, the drinker will quickly figure out that his two-drink deficit can’t be slaked with actual drinking, or drugs, or adventure, or money, or sex, or the approval of strangers. He’ll still envy people who can have one glass of wine a night, but not as much as he’ll envy those who can have five. There are many who feel that as long as they are a functioning alcoholic, they’re not an alcoholic. That’s the sad logic of the besotted mind.

Not all alcohol consumption is bad, but most of it remains unexamined. How many bad decisions have been made under the fuzzy blanket of alcohol? How many mornings have been salted with the detective work of piecing together the previous night? How many afternoons have been christened with new drinks to swallow old shame? It’s a carousel that some stay on because they think carousels are fun. Maybe they are, but they don’t go anywhere.

It’s Friday, and once again the lure of the Party Coves of North Texas is calling. To many, this past weekend’s toll is already a forgotten news story bearing someone else’s name, and the party will go on. Most of the lake drinkers will be young and will survive the delicious pleasures of an unwise youth, but some will be those older drinkers carrying nervous kids with watchful eyes.

We still have a lot of summer left and a lot of beer. I just hope we, I included, enjoy it with a splash of moderation. It may be a killjoy virtue but it’s also a certain salvation. For our light drinkers, I feel gratitude and hope. For my fellow heavy drinkers, I fear most of us will tread water a long time before we’re hit with the illumination that means rescue.

It all started so [casually](http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/e153b/i_accidentally_got_drunk_on_my_way_to_work_this/c14gtbm), but has now ballooned to over 11,000 subscribers and growing. 

We've come pretty far as a community, haven't we? We've had chaotic [meetups](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/q1t9h/pittsburgh_meetup_update_now_with_100_more_gay/) that ended with unholy [marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/sdlxe/the_unholy_union_of_moonfag_unedited/) and [carnage](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/rpy2q/pittsburgh_carnage_report/). We've had some move up in the world and become [land owners](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/zl278/holy_fuck_ca_i_bought_a_house_today/). We've even had official [marriages](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/po1cp/pics_from_the_ca_wedding_courtesy_of_ichc_mod/). 

As we've watched, through one open bloodshot eye, the community grow to what it is today, we've seen a show of love and support for a largely misunderstood type of person that one can't find many other places. We've offered love and condolences for each other during [bad times](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tcxhf/mom_passed_this_morning/), and offered congratulations and love for those during [good times](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/p06oe/i_fucking_made_it_and_ive_got_ca_to_thank/).

We've gotten to know each other in many ways. From comparing our [personality types](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/10nhnq/breakdown_of_personality_type_thread_responses/) to more comical comparisons such as [places we've puked](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/10riu7/today_i_barfed_on_the_floor_of_a_cathedral_older/) and what we [*won't* drink](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/q0pik/what_is_the_one_drink_you_find_that_you_cannot/).

We've had [contests](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/q6txs/skuuzi_up_for_grabs_for_someone_in_the_us_or/) for the fun of it, [secret](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/m5fsz/crippling_alcoholism_secret_santa/) [santas](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/vb3ym/crippling_alcoholism_summer_secret_santa/), gotten [coozies](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/n1i3f/this_dumbass_dunem_sent_me_3_total_packages_over/) and [stickers](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/jq44c/dune_fuck_yeah_thanks_for_the_stickers_i_cut_one/), showed off our furry [drinking buddies](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/skpup/hey_ca_can_i_see_your_petdrinkin_buddy/), gotten [tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/qpqay/ca_for_life_cheers_to_dune_for_the_design_which/)... Actually, [we've](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/xin1s/another_one_branded_for_life/) gotten [lots](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tiv6j/the_less_bloody_version_did_dune_forget_to/) of [tattoos](http://www.reddit.com/r/lookatthisfuckingca/comments/10lhm0/bros/). And we even wrote a [book](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/tldkn/choose_your_own_adventure_ca_book/)!!

We've had our share of bad times. We've gotten sick. We've been depressed. We've had it rough. But through it all we have stuck together and supported each other and shown each other love that has kept us going and made us something more than a subreddit. It's made us a family. One giant drunk family. 

A family that keeps growing in both population, and complexity. Branching out to many sister subs like /r/drunkencookery, /r/lookatthisfuckingca, /r/drunkpoetryslam, and even /r/HelloIDrinkKThxBai!! We have a still booming [chat](https://www.icanhazchat.com/ca) and now our own [poker club](http://www.reddit.com/r/capokerclub/). We continue to grow in many ways. We come from all walks of life. From high functioning alcoholics, to those who are barely hanging on, but we all know when we come here that we are all in this together and have love and respect for one another, even when those of us need to [take breaks](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/z58rg/cas_and_moderationabstinence/). This is a place we call home. 

I would also like to give a special thanks to the chat owners and mods, both former and present, who work tirelessly to keep chat running as smoothly as possible. It's not an easy job, but you guys certainly do it well. 

And another thanks to the sub mods, both new and old, for all of your input, work, and efforts to keep this sub as helpful and homelike to a very rare group of people to make feel comfortable and welcomed. And of course, to Deighv, who decided to turn in his modding badge and gun recently. You are loved and missed, but we all hope you are doing well and are happy. Hope to see you around these parts again someday.

We know. I'm urging you to move quickly past the ""Hi I'm _____ and I think I'm broken too"" and start where other conversations end. You are among someone who gets that. We don't need an explanation. We already know.

Come to think of it maybe CA IS your Drunk Therapist.  Maybe CA is the safe environment where you can bear your true self to try to figure out what what the hell happened and what you are gonna do next when you can think of no other options. Maybe CA is your Drunk Confessor. Maybe CA is the place you go to to talk about the things you never will be able to tell your family, friends and coworkers because you don't think they could never understand and are unlikely to forgive.

Different people go to CA for very different reasons. Entertainment, Advice, Companionship or Acceptance. Like a good Little Black Dress it's simple but there is a lot going on. For many CA is answering a need they find hard to fulfill anywhere else. Let's keep it a place we can dispense with the redundant."	t5_2s68b	True

I went outside for a cigarette and came back in to find that there was only one seat at the bar that wasn't taken. In the seat next to me was a decent looking female and she starts to flirt with me. Long story short, her boyfriend and 4 of his friends wanted to beat the shit out of me. I stood up for myself and had some unkind words for them, but I didn't fight or even threaten to fight. The bouncer then starts pushing me out and cursing at me and telling me he's gonna beat the shit out of me. Then the cops show up (one of the guys called the cops and said I was trying to fight everybody and grabbing girls' asses - not true). At this point, the bouncer tells me ""Oh, never mind, here come the cops and they're gonna beat the shit out of you."" His wish came true and the cops, indeed, beat the shit out of me, even though I was cooperative and polite (to both the police and the bouncer). So, here's the victory part... I butt-dialed my lawyer and the entire thing is recorded on her voicemail. This all still has to pan out (just happened last Monday night). But I'm feeling some employees of the bar and some police officers getting a class 4 felony for conspiracy to commit perjury. Not to mention some other things that may benefit me. Hurray!

Edit: I will post the voicemail when my lawyer says I can. I promise... it's coming. The title of the post will be... 'Here is the voicemail recording you cynical fucks were demanding.'"	t5_2s68b	True
1347975653.0	102tou	Just a warning to you wonderful fuckers ...	ca8172	123	21	20	"I'm posting this under a throwaway but I just wanted to send out a warning to CA due to some experiences I've had recently.

Over the years I progressed from beer to wine to vodka as many of us other CAs have.  Recently up to a liter a day on extended benders.

I'm just going to warn that this is (at least for me) where shit started to get downright scary.  The withdrawals got so bad I decided to do a 5-day hospital detox.  That didn't help and I relapsed.  2 days later I was back in the ER because my stomach refused to hold down anything, including water.

A CT-scan confirmed pancreatitis.  80% of that is caused by alcohol and it's not something to fuck with.  Great.  Admitted to hospital for 5 days, nothing allowed by mouth.  Good times.

Did I stop then?  No.

The last major bender I decided ""fuck this, and fuck hospitals"" and decided to go through withdrawals unsupervised.  **BAD IDEA**.  If there is anything to take out of this, if you get up to this level, **DON'T DO THIS**.  Either do it supervised or do a careful fucking taper.  I know this is on the sidebar and whatnot but man ... it's just crazy.

I hallucinated out of my mind for days.  I can't even describe the intensity of these hallucinations but they were absolutely incredibly real and far beyond what I thought a ""hallucination"" would ever be.  Finally (oddly, thank god) a cop questioned me and called an ambulance.  4 more days in the hospital and was diagnosed with a lack of vitamin B-1 (Thiamin) also known as [Korsakoff's psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korsakoff's_syndrome) (a ""mild"" version that apparently is fully recoverable ... I don't even want to think about what a ""non-mild"" version of that shit is).  Mostly because I wasn't eating.  They shot me up with B1, the hallucinations stopped, and all was normal again.

Anyway, whatever.  That's my two cents.  I've been through hell and back and am just warning everyone to be fucking careful when you get towards these levels ... it's no joke.  I'm not trying to be all preachy but you *don't* want to go there.

**edit**: To all the down-voters on this, I can assure you this is 100% true and was *not* a good time.  I wouldn't be wasting my time typing all that shit out if it wasn't true.

1363725403.0	1am6s9	friendly PSA - intro to ecigs for dummies		120	14	86	"Howdy yall.

Why am I making this post?

Well most all of us are heavy smokers, and most of us are in unfavorable financial situations. Yes, sir, I could help alleviate both of those situations. Also I just plain' ol' take kind to yall. 

I've been vaping for about 3 years. The first 2 years are really shitty, so I know what doesn't work. For the last year I've started using eGos (I'll get into that later) and man it's just my bread 'n butter now. 

When I started using ecigs I really had no one to talk to so everything was just confusing as all hell. Now that I got some worldly wisdom I figure I'll do myself a little community service and spread the good word.


---------------------------------------

""Okay dogg like alright but like what are the benefits of ecigs""

Alright

**1.) Mad cheaper**

I'm basically living out in the country, and even in the middle of the corn belt without a 4 story building in sight cigarettes run 7 bucks a fucking pack. Damn, son. It don't take Oppenheimer to figure out a pack of day is like hella money, you feel money?

I'm gonna show you how to get started on ecigs (here on out referred to as vapes or personal vapes or some shit like that), with a GOOD kit, for about 20 bucks. After that you can be all sorts of high on nicotine and vaping fat clouds for about $3.50 a week. Awh shit. All that money you save maybe you can buy some fresh meats what ain't out a can.

**2.) Well like I think they're healthier**

So... Uh... I breathe better? I don't know man I aint no med school doctor geek. The head doctor geek of the UK, somewhat equivalent to our Surgeon General, has officially stated that there is essentially no way ecigs could even be nearly as dangerous as cigarettes.

On top of that, all ingrediants in ecigs are ""Generally Realized as Safe"" and used in a variety of medical and food applications anyday.

Just the nicotine, baby, and fat clouds of vapor. Ain't none of that other shit. Just a pile of biscuits with some nice gravy, mmm-hm.

So what I'm trying to say is

**3.) It's the only smoking alternative that is enjoyable**

So I'm not trying to convince anyone to quit - but you totally could. I'm more so convincing people to subsidize. 

I picked up ecigs because they seemed interesting. I've been fucking around for 3 years with them. A year ago I finally found out the best way of vaping (I'll get into that later) and now, without even trying to quit or antyhing, I only smoke 0-4 cigarettes a day. I used to be a pack-a-day newport 100 smoker.

Now I prefer ecigs 98% of the time, and smoking a menthol cigarette makes me feel all funny in a bad way. Same with most regulars. I keep a pouch of American Spirit for whenever I still fancy a smoke and I've had the same damned pouch for maybe a month now, barely used half of it.

**4.) Vape anywhere**

So like some states are passing some fascist ass laws, but for the most part, it's not *not* legal to vape inside. I do it on the downlow anyways. I don't want people asking me questions and shit.

Yet if you're in an apartment or a home you can't smoke in, or your buddy don't let you smoke inside no more since he got a baby in the house now, well you can vape there dog! 

**5.) When you're rolling balls with your girl she won't be like ""OMG why do you have to go out for a cigarette??? You don't love me enough??"" even though you're liek ""Baby c'mon it aint like that"" and like when you're driving in the car and she's all ""Don't roll the window down! it's cold! omg your cigarette smells so bad!"" well you won't have no more of that**

Dude what's even with chicks never wanting the window down? Damn.

----------------------------------------

**What follows is the basic 20 dollar starter kit.** This is the one, same website same thing, I've referred several friends and my brother to and they've been vaping happy for months now. Ain't buyin' packs and shit. 

A quick word before I continue: all cigarette-sized ecigs are not worth any of your fucking money, they fucking suck. Why? The battery is small and the output is weak. The batteries only last about one minute, and they produce a shitty amount of vapor. Not satisfying at all. Fucking frustrating, and you quit.

All those kits, like blu or whatever, that come with pre-loaded cartomizers - fucking rip off, man. fucking rip off. Shitty batteries, just, just shitty. Fucking shitty.

For my first two years I used cigarette sized ecigs and I'd just always give up one them and go back to the ports.

So these are the two things you need:

1.) [Starter kit- $13.00](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/kits/products/katana-kit)

This includes a battery, a charger, and a clearomizer. The battery and charger will last up to a year and a half if you treat them right, the clearomizer is good for a month before it starts performing subpar.

This is called an ""eGo"" style battery. It has a 510/eGo connection, which is the standard and most popular connection. This is sweet because it means that you can get a whole bunch of shit for it and everything works with everything else. 

The battery is 650 mah so it should last all day for a new user and then you can charge it at night for the next day.

Make sure you read the back of the package, has some friendly tips on filling and operation.

2.) [A bottle of juice- $5](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/vape-juice-menu)

Damn, son, look at all those flavors! Make sure you get 24mg - that means high nicotine. 

3.) A five dollar shipping fee....

Huh other websites have cheaper shipping fees? Still ain't bad. Ships fast.

The website the previous links are from is VapeDojo. VapeDojo is good people, they're on the east coast somewhere. My friends and I have made multiple orders from them and they all arrive quick.

Two of my friends have had either the battery or the clearo break after the two week warranty expired, and after writing a nice letter to VapeDojo, they got free replacements shipped to them pretty quick.

Good folk.

I'd like to take a moment to say that I in no way represent any vendor in any way. I mean you guys know me so that's not necesarry to say, but I mean, it's just a nice thing to say, you know?

-----------------------------------------------

""Wahhh I don't want that one it's too big!""

The katana kit I linked you to, it's really not that big. About the size of a sharpie marker. It actually looks pretty cool too. I used to be like you but when I made the jump to a larger ecig I just didn't regret a damned thing.

I mean, what do you care what people lookin' at you think? Fuck 'em. 


-------------------------------------------

**The following are three vendors I like.**

Since it is an infantile industry and technology, one must be aware of shady vendors. Too many of them. These following people, I like them. I like them a lot... For what it's worth whenever I deal with a new vendor I google the fuck out of them and look them up on ecig forums to hear what everyone has to say about them.

 I do NOT represent them in any way but they're who I send my friends to. They all have great customer service, shipping, and prices.

1.) [ivape](http://ivape.net/) for parts (toppers, clearomizers). 

iVape is my bread and butter. They're who I get my [clearomizers](http://ivape.net/index.php/Cartomizers/eGo.html) from. I fucking love their juice but there's a cheaper place for juice.

Vape Dojo also sells clearomizers, but the prices are just a little worse and they don't have as large a selection. For example, iVape sells clearos for 3-4 dollars whereas vape dojo is 5-9 dollars. I mean, I guess, it would be simpler to just buy off one place but I'm just saying, you know.

Notice how all the batteries and clearomizers say eGo or 510. That's the connection type you have. It's the best, trust me. Just make sure whenever you get something it is eGo of 510.

2.) [VapeDojo](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/all-ego-batteries) for [batteries](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/all-ego-batteries) and [clearos](http://www.vapedojo.com/collections/clearomizers-and-tanks)

**the cool thing about vapedojo is everything they have is eGo/510 style so you don't have to worry about getting a mismatched battery/clearo**

You're already paying five bucks for shipping so you might as well toss another battery in there. Like I said, VapeDojo is good people. Like I said, make sure you get an eGo type battery. It's a good idea to have two batteries anyways, in case one dies when you're out and about or one to vape when the other is charging.

The battery I use is another eGo sized battery. It's calledthe eGo twist. It's the same type and size as the battery in your starter kit, so it will fit with all your clearomizers and chargers and shit. The advantage is the battery is twice as large and you can adjust the voltage (not as confusing as it sounds) so you can jack it up like crazy to have a powerful cloud of vape, or turn it down for a more mellow cloud.

When you buy your starter it's a good idea to buy another clearo and a new battery... Wait actually it would be cheaper to just get another katana kit, so then you have two of everything. Alright. Do that, if you can.


3.) [Mount Baker Vapor](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/electronic-cigarette-nicotine-juice/) for juice.

Far as I'm concerned, this is the only place to get juice.

Everyone loves the fuck out of mount baker vapor. They make all their shit in america, they have the BEST prices, and they ship fast as hell.

You can get a 50ml bottle for $10.99. That's fucking huge, man, fucking huge. It will last you at least two months. 

Make sure you get 24mg nicotine. Anymore than that might be too much, any less might not scratch your itch. Also get 50%PG/50%VG - don't worry about what that shit means, just stick with 50pg/50vg.

---------------------------------

**Handy websites**

1.) /r/electronic_cigarette

Fellas there treat you kind. All sorts of sidebar info for newbies, always happy to answer questions.

2.) [Vapor Joe's](http://vaporjoe.blogspot.com/)

This guy doesn't work for anyone, he just trolls the internet to find and share all the best deals.

-------------------------------------------------

Well uh I kind of wrote that like shit? Maybe it was a better idea in my head.

Whatever. **If you guys have any questions or shit ask me, I'm happy to help a friend.**

Cheers.

-------------------

Edit: holy fuck that is a wall of text. I don't think anyone will read that.... I wonder if the judge will count this as community service.

------------------

**A quick note for non-Americans**

Customs and borders are funny about ecigs and stuff, so I can't vouch for any of these vendors for your country. Even Canada. I know Canada and UK have some good websites for them though, so go ask /r/electronic_cigarette

-------------------------

**Water**

Vaping, especially high VG fluids, can dry out your mouth and throat so you should drink a bunch of water or keep water nearby. You should be drinking a gallon of water a day anyways it's like ten sorts of good for you dogg.


------------------------------------------

**Cost analysis**

Disregarding batteries since they last about a year.

Clearos:

Average four bucks. Last, average, four weeks before you want a new one.

4/28 =

0.14

Juice:

11 bucks for 50ml. I vape a lot, a lot lot, let's say about 1.5ml a day. 50/1.5 = 33.33 days out of a 50 ml bottle. Earlier I said this size bottle would last two months easy, and I stand by that, since when you start out vaping you prolly won't vape 1.5ml a day, and honestly, I'm probably in the 0.8 - 1.5 range so I took the high estimate.

11/33.33 =

0.33

0.14 + 0.33 = 0.47 a day in running costs

0.47 * 7 days a week =

**$3.29 per week.**

So... Yeah... That ain't bad. 

In reality I splurge and buy extra juice and stuff so for me it's probably about 5 or 6 dollars a week.

*Final word*

You probably couldn't see that expression on her face, but she would be.

Yeah, I couldn't tell my boss that.  

I can, however, talk to him about my career path and such over a couple of beers because that's what society does.

I bought a bottle of rum earlier, and the goddamn cashier asked me, ""Do you think we're gonna have an early winter this year?""  Goddamnit, not all black people look alike.  I'm not Al Roker, okay?  I know your job sucks, as do most peoples'...but you can do better than that in making your day more entertaining.  Show me your tits.  See, that was fun, wasn't it?

If you want to get to know me, share something meaningful with me.  I will gladly reciprocate.  I want people to trust me...it shows me that there are people who want to talk about more than the weather.  At least I don't go to college frat parties anymore.  ""Oh, you're a what major?  Oh, cool!  No really, your concentration of study DOES interest me somewhat.  It doesn't, but I have to act this way in order to bang you.""  

Kinda sad that I, as a 25-year old, find the concept of getting laid is too shallow and too much of a chore.  I have to HIDE this from her?  But if I wait 3 months she'll be mad, and if I tell her too soon she'll freak out and not want to see me again.  It's one of many catch-22's that makes me drink more 80-proof beverages in order to not give a crap about how things went with that girl.  What 80-proof beverage?  Vodka.  And no, bartender, I don't have a vodka preference.  Actually, I do.  Burnett's.  Because I'm poor and it will get me just as loose as the Goose.  Now watch my friends try to push me into girls because I'm not being social enough and me endlessly respond with ""after I finish this drink, I'll go talk to her"".  And then I'll act like I'm interested in the bracelet I noticed and ask what sentimental value it has and she'll probably realize I'm faking said interest.  And she will be correct.

1368573343.0	1eciar	Small victories, guys:	Roderick111	115	13	29	"So, just bought a new house with my fiance about a month ago. I've got my drinking under control -- just a pint of vodka (375 mL) per night, which I sneak in the basement where my writing desk is. 

I am writing, every day, after work, finished my novel. But that's not the small victory, that's just life.

MY small victory is that when I have to pee, which is about every 30 mins, I walk to the bathroom next to the laundry in my basement and bypass a drain. Every single time I walk in there, I pause, and consider whether or not to piss in the drain or to walk the 5 extra steps and piss in the toilet. 

I piss in the toilet every time, because I am an adult, with responsibilities, and I'll be damned if I'm going to piss in a drain when there is a toilet nearby.

I saw that post about putting socks on bottles and got really excited because I thought someone was using my signature Alaskan bottle cooling technique. But alas, it was something goddamn silly and trivial about glass making noise. 

Wanna know whats not silly and trivial? Warm fucking whiskey, that's what. Check this shit out: take a bottle of something. Glass works but plastic is better. Go somewhere fucking hot and dry and terrible like camping in Colorado in the middle of the summer. Now take a sip of your cheapass whiskey from the plastic fifth at about 2pm. Pretty fucking bad right? Here's what we do: Take off your nice wool sock (you fucking better be wearing nice wool socks when you go camping. Just because you're gonna be a drunk asshole doesn't mean you want to die cold and hungry because of a blister). Now: get that sock fucking wet. Like. Fucking. Soaked. (with water). Now put the bottle in the sock. Now SWIRL THAT FUCKER OVER YOUR HEAD LIKE AN INJUN WITH A SLING. 

Motherfucking evaporation makes your warmass whiskey not so warm whiskey. Now THAT, ladies and gentleman, is how you use a sock.

Cheers, 

Van

p.s. You can also masturbate with them. I recommend using different socks for each purpose.

*edit* also the lower the humidity the better because the evaporation happens faster."	t5_2s68b	True

Those pics you bring into this subreddit of your collection of bottles.  Was it fun?  Lord, I hope so.  I even hope you had sex that didn't shame your homophobic ways.

You know what, Chad?  It's not quite 9 o'clock here, and I'm pass out, bordering on black out drunk.  

You know why, Chad?  Because I woke up extra early, so I could get my day over with, and get home, and start drinking as soon as possible.

You know what I would do with a ball of string, Chad?  I'd get a shotgun and pull a Hemmingway.  You know why, Chad?  Because I could give a flying fuck if your parents are in Aruba, and you got access to their liquor cabinet and their friends' cheerleaders' pussies.

You see, Chad, you're a drunk, and I'm an alcoholic.  My existence hurts so much, that if I had a ball of string and a shotgun, I'd gladly tie one end to the trigger, and the other to a toe.  Then I'd imagine wriggling my toes in the sand, and I'd be in tropical paradise forever.

But I can't do that, Chad.  You see, your society put responsibilities on me.  I have to raise a kid.  I have to feed my dogs.   I have to hold down a respectable job to accomplish these things, and your society says I can't  get drunk and do that too.

So, what do I do Chad?  I drink at opportune moments.  I go to work at 6 in the morning so I can catch the special happy hours.  I get to know the gas station beer guy, so he'll sell to me when I'm blind.

I try masturbating to porn to make up for the loneliness, but it only goes so far.  When you get to the point of watching girls lick piss off the toilet seat, you're beyond human interaction, Chad. You're at the point of hopelessness.

I am a crippled alcoholic, Chad.  You get your pictures of koozies, dart boards, and apartment kitchen cutting boards the fuck off my subreddit.  This is my only home.  I'm drunk, self serving, and alone.  Except when I'm here.

To everyone else, thank you guys for helping me through a really rough time in my life, this place may be a loony bin but it's full of some of the most kind hearted people I've ever had the pleasure of encountering.  

That said.... I know I dropped off the planet about 5 months ago or so, a lot of you know I've found myself in a great relationship and kind of just dropped out of the loop. Don't get me wrong, I was still drinking heavily! I did cut back, especially after leaving chat. (You enablers!) I was still drinking daily, however, and starting to get really sick of the lifestyle.  

Fast forward to two weeks ago, had a sudden moment of realization, drove to Walmart at 10:30pm, peed on a stick, I'm pregnant. Thrown suddenly into withdrawals, luckily made a little easier by the fact that I'd been cutting back to evenings only, still incredibly tough to go through with no mental preparation whatsoever.  

However.... I'm fucking excited! I'm gonna be a MOM! So this will probably be my last post in here, I'm at least 7.5 months away from even being able to consume alcohol in small amounts.

1372183117.0	1h1ut4	One Night With Mr Chow	SnoopTidder	109	9	39	"So I figured I'd tell all you booze bags about the fucking shit-show that went down last weekend. Enjoy. 

Sunday evening and I'm doing what us fuckers do best, getting shit-faced on chat. Next thing I know, there's a knock at my room door, the kind of knock that sounds like the door is probably propping up the person on the other side. Hesitantly, I get up and go to answer the door fearing the worst. To my surprise a red faced, drunken Chinese man falls into my room and declares his need for booze, women and anything else in between. 

Now In my drunken stupor I identified said red-faced Chinese bloke as a guy who lives in my apartment block, he does have a name but in the interest of preserving his dignity we'll call him Mr Chow. 

I sit this geezer down and he notices I'm on chat, he then proceeds to tell me in depth how he needs a woman and is curious if he can meet them through a chat room full of alcoholics. Needless to say, some cringe worthy, weird shit happened and we got kicked off chat. 

""We Go Bar""

Alright, so this fucker wants to drink some more (sounds good to me) and even better, he keeps shouting ""I PAY!"", ""I PAY EVERYTHING!"" Awesome. 

Mr Chow and I proceed outta the apartment and take a stroll down to a little wine-bar-can'tmakeit'sfuckingmindupifit'sapubornot sorta place, full of (to Mr Chow's disappointment) blokes. Anyways, he hands me £100 and tells me to get beer, It's busy and I wanna get drunk, so I buy us 2 beers each and a bottle of some shitty sugar water tastin' cider. Bear in mind, we were both already shit-faced, so 3 drinks in at the bar and I'm already feeling buzzed; in the dimly lit bar, I noticed that Mr Chow has a face redder than a fuckin' tomato. He heaves a sigh, shrugs his shoulders, looks at me with a desperate expression on his face and says ""Tidder, there no girls here""... Now I drunkenly tell him that I am the MAN when it comes to picking up women (I'm definitely not) and decide to take him someplace else. 

The next establishment is decidedly more classy than the wine bar, the clientele here are more mature and the beer is great. Except, Mr Chow is too fucking drunk to get served, I protest his innocence but the bar keep says we've both had enough. 

-At this point, the night takes a turn for the fucking weird- 

So Chow and I find ourselves on the terrace outside the bar, smoking these cheap Chinese cigarettes called something happiness, fuck If I remember the name but the filters are gold and it looks baller as fuck. He has eyed up a woman who is out with a group of friends, and decides he is going to go over and talk to her. Now Chow's command of the English language is fucking shocking at best, like seriously..he can not speak English to save his fucking life. I know at this point, whatever follows, is going to be embarrassing, so I drunkenly decide that I am now German and have no idea why Mr Chow acts this way, and also, don't know him. 

I haven't learnt German since I was in secondary school, let alone bothered speaking it, but in a crowd of drunken people, I might just be able to pass it off. So there we are, German Tidder, Mr Chow tomato face and old ugly hag who looks old enough to be my grandmother. I move closer and listen into the conversation, it goes a little like this: 

""You Come Drink With Us""

-He points at me-

(Fuck now I'm involved and she is speaking to me)

""Hey what's your name?""

""Tidder""

""Where are you guys from?""

-I make a grand show of pointing at myself and in my best retard voice say- 

""I coming from Deustchland, meine freunde coming from Hong Kong""

They buy it, I have become the German.

Things seem to be going well, Mr Chow has befriended a battle axe and I am just there, being drunk and German. But, Mr Chow isn't content with just talking, it's time to make inappropriate, rapey sounding comments apparently. 

Mr Chow - ""I PAY £5000 YOU COME BACK MY BED""

Cringed so fucking hard I choked on my cig, seriously? Is this happening? In shock, I look over at the woman who has remained silent, as has the gathering crowd of smokers, I try to read her face but fuck I'm drunk. 

""How about we go for a drink first?""

What? This mongoose of a woman has seemingly decided to take him up on his offer? I have no idea. Next thing I know, we're walking back to the previous bar, drunken woman in tow. I feel like the accessory to a crime, I have to avert whatever drunken debauchery is about to happen, not for her sake but for Mr Chow, I mean..she's literally 50 years old and the whole situation is fucking embarrassing. 

So we get back to bar number one, as a group we try to go back inside only for the gargantuan bouncer to rest one hand on Mr Chow's shoulder and politely tell him to ""Fuck off"". Now Mr Chow is drunk as shit but that was downright rude, I take a step forward to give this guy a piece of my mind but before I can open my mouth, Mr Chow has gone full snoop. 

This crazy Chinese fuck decides to cause a scene, and repeatedly asks the bouncer at the top of his lungs ""HOW AM I DRUNK?"" ""HUH?"" ""HOW FUCK AM I DRUNK?"" ""HOW MY DRUNK?"" something to that effect. Long story short, the woman realizes now is a good time to bail (for this I commend her) and Mr Chow and I find ourselves sprawled against the metal railings outside this shitty bar with a bouncer in our face. Needless to say, we got thrown out. 

I'm thinking now is a fucking brilliant time to go home (God this story is proper long innit?) but Mr Chow isn't fucking done. He hasn't got a wife yet. Or whatever the fuck he wants. ""We go town"", ""We go club""...so he drunk dials a fucking taxi service, which miraculously understands him, and a taxi actually arrives to take us on a voyage of fuckuperry. 

-The next portion of the night is a complete fucking blur so I'm not even gonna attempt to articulate it here-

Boom, we're in a taxi headed back to my flat, under the glow of passing street lamps, Mr Chow has become a fucking beetroot, the guy looks like he ate that gum from Willy Wonka, I take this as meaning he has probably imbibed enough alcohol to kill a horse. I'm in no better shape. As I stare into his partially closed eyes, we silently confirm, that indeed, we are both drunk as fucking shit. A voice breaks the silence. ""That'll be a fiver mate."" Mr Chow hands over a tenner,  and the cabbie hands us back £3 ...now I ain't no mathematician but I think we've just been robbed outta 2 measly quid. 

Mr Chow is enraged. He decides the Taxi man is racist, and I am inclined to agree because drunk. There's an argument and Mr Chow gets man handled outta the car, I jump out the other side and I'm like shit is about to go down. Except the taxi bloke just jumps back in the car and starts driving off, but not before Mr Chow unleashes a fucking Bruce lee Karate kick to the side of the car, much to the taxi blokes dismay. 

Anyways, I grab Chow, tell him to come inside before this fucktard calls the cops, but he's having none of it, we're stood in the middle of the road like 2 fucking bafoons, trying to block a taxi man driving off, whilst Mr Chow repeatedly tries to kick the fucking fender. The dickhead revs up, and to basically ensure neither of us die, I physically drag angry Chow to the apartment. 

Fuck knows what happened next, but I woke up to the Police in my room and was taken to hospital. 

I asked my housemates where Mr Chow was and they told me he'd left to get a plane back to China. 

I'll miss that fucking guy.

1363784267.0	1anrlj	Hello, r/CA! Let's have a little chat.	ceciliaxamanda	113	16	63	"It has come to the attention of many CAs recently that the quality of posts here has taken a sharp nosedive into the abysmal. In speaking to at least one mod awhile back, I was informed that I should see the quality of what gets removed. This makes me sad, CA.

Once upon a time, CA was filled with lots of stories; some sad, some funny, and some just plain ridiculous. I miss those days. No one seems to be able to find any joy in their lives anymore. And if that's you, well, I'm sorry. But you can still try to find some little glimmer of light in your life, whether it be maintaining just enough sobriety to get to the interview of that job you really want, or scraping up enough change to get an extra can of 211 for the night. Both of those are good things! So there's my first request - look for the little things, I'm sure you'll find something.

My second request - please do not come to r/CA for legal advice, be it on your DUI, a friend's DUI, that DUI you think you might get tonight, or anything else. As a legal professional, I ***strongly*** advise against getting legal advice from Reddit in any capacity, but especially do ***not*** ask for it from r/CA. You're just getting someone else's experiences, and laws vary from city to city - if you have a situation in which you may need to seek legal advice, do just that. There are resources available in many jurisdictions to provide limited counsel or general advice in most situations. 

My third request - it's not a pissing contest, so let's not treat it as such. No one cares how much you can drink, and it's not nice to make fun of someone who has a lower tolerance. There's all sorts of different factors that go into someone's alcohol tolerance, and judging someone for just how much they drink is wrong, yeah? Yeah, it fucking is, this is fucking CRIPPLING ALCOHOLISM, a group for people who accept their lifestyle choice and don't want to be interrupted by underage, weekend-warriors posting about puking at the beer pong tournament they had when Ricky C's parents went to Aruba last summer! Judgement works both ways - you may have been shamed by someone for drinking too much, don't try to shame someone else for drinking too little by your own standards. 

My fourth request - if you have a medical situation that genuinely worries, ***SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION***. There is a lot of valuable information in the sidebar, but nothing can substitute the advice of an actual medical professional. As mentioned above in regards to tolerance, everyone is made differently. What may be no big deal for one person could be the difference between life and death for another person. And in that same vein, don't come here just to ask for help and then just respond with ""Nah, I'm just gonna ride it out, see what happens."" That is attention-seeking behavior, and it's exasperating.

My fifth request - do not come here to ""fly a sign"", so to speak. As a disclaimer, there are regulars who have been here for a long time who are known to many who occasionally ask for help. That's fine - but don't try to take advantage of people here. Some people come here to beg for booze or pizza - if you're in such a situation, that sucks and I'm sorry, but try taking it to /r/randomactsofpizza or something like that. This is not /r/randomactsofbooze.

Next thing you know, you're having a random cocktail on your lunch break, and feeling naughty about it.

Then it's 3 cocktails.  No remorse.  

Then it's Bailey's in your morning coffee.  Some remorse.   

I am a long time lurker, first time poster.  I am typing with one eye open, otherwise the screen is too blurry.  

You fuckers understand.  I am neither ashamed nor proud.  I am a fully functioning member of society... As long as I have some booze in me. 

My bf thinks I drink too much (duh) (he has no idea about my liquid lunch).  He's right.  I do.  But I get shit done and I hold down a job...even if I'm sneaking booze at work, and at home. 

I have no point, really.  Except that the last few months of lurking here has made me feel... Better?  At least not alone.  

So.  Kudos. This sub manages to neither glamorize, nor demonize, the boozing that makes our days worthwhile. 

I wil take 2 more swigs of my hidden off brand hazelnut liqueur and watch terrible tv, and blame my insomnia, when I pass out on the couch.

This feels like a rant.  I'm sorry.  I just appreciate you fuckers. And I'm a stranger.  So there are likely other strangers who are like me.  Not douchey enough for r/drunk... And teetering on the verge of being a CA.

TL;DR:  y'all get me, even though I hide.

Nicole Abbate, Angie Chiovari, Sarah Gosdecki and me went to see INXS perform at Soldier Field. It was a great concert. We drank sloe gin from the bottle. 
We were really into sloe gin that summer. 
Perceiving it as somehow feminine and elegant. 

Sarah had this blonde hair that was like a mane. So thick it boggled my mind, almost too thick-- equine. 
Nicole was a beautiful Italian girl, a little thick in the torso, but long black hair that got too hot to touch in the summer sun, while Angie was a more ""ethnic"" Italian, big nose, swarthy, funny as fuck and she loved men in a similar fashion as I did.  

We lay like drunken newborn kittens on our outspread blanket. Nesting in each others' hair, heads on friends' stomachs looking up at the blurry night sky. Singing to one of our favorite bands. We were young, and stupid, we knew it and we didn't care. 

Angie and I went for a prowl. I caught ~ and returned the gaze of a very handsome Mexican man. He was slight build,  a sculpted face,  more Spanish than Indian. He was with 3 other men. We all started talking. Angie said that they should come back to our spot and hang. 

*How old were we?*
*Oh, we were definitely 18 and at DePaul.*
* No, definitely not in high school.*
* Did we look young? Hmmm.*
* Oh, you guys are 23/24 or so?*
*Oh okay. Loyola?* 

We hung out the rest of the concert, they shared their shitty pot with  us. We exchanged names. Xavier was the Mexican. Tim was a blonde, with a drinking tolerance I had not seen before or since. His skin, shiny and slimed with the alcohol that seeped from within was tan. He was a shitshow. 
Nicole loved him immediately. 

We got their numbers. We wanted so badly to hang out with these older men. Like our vaginas had some sort of Divine Plan, secret to us but they tugged us along urging us to fuck these dangerous, drunken boys. 

We were rich girls. They were definitely *not* in undergrad. These boys lived on the South Side. These boys oozed poverty and fun. We had money for booze. They could buy it. They bought booze with our Rich Girl Money. 

Tim had a truck. An old Ford 250. I had never even *been* in a truck. 
Sunbleached, the clear coat long gone; fat white stripe down the side. We drank and drove around in that truck all summer. Stopping in land preserves to smoke pot &amp; grill. It was great. 

The girls and I sunning ourselves in the back of that truck legs dangling over; listening to Paul's Boutique ad nauseum. 

We knew we could never take them home, these rough boys. They would never be able to do a Sunday luncheon at the golf course with our fathers like the boys we were *supposed* to date. 

Just like we knew we could never meet the mothers of these boys, sight unseen; we knew they would hate us. Our monogrammed bags, the pearl studs we all wore, presents from our fathers at Confirmation. 

But we loved fucking these rough men, and they us. Somehow, their lack of breeding translated to a pure animal lust in the bedroom that terrified and kept us spellbound. 

As the fall, and our senior year approached, we knew our days and nights with these boys would be coming to an end. Our waking hours consumed instead by school, studying, and applying for college. 

And they knew it too. Knew we'd be moving on, while they'd stay. Stay in the City, on their end of it. 

Drinking Old Style.

I'm making three types of post:

* 'Ethanol as a source of Energy'

* '[Ethanol and its effects on the human body's Hormonal System](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/vzzzq/cas_and_nutrition_ethanol_and_hormones)'

* 'Ethanol's relationship with Nutrients, and Deficiencies of the latter'.

Please note that I have absolutely zero background in science, or at least zero post high school. If you have any information to add, or correct, please do so in the comments below. Also, I strongly urge that no one ever takes anything I say as medical advice nor information, but rather just as my own personal thoughts. There is obviously a clear difference there, and it is very important to me that this difference is understood.

---

**Ethanol**

[Ethanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) - the 'drinking alcohol' - is the psychoactive drug that we all love/need to imbibe, whether recreationally or as self-medication or for whatever purpose.

Besides being psychoactive, it is also a [potent fuel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Uses). This is pretty unique as far as drugs go.

**Calories**

A Calorie is a measure of energy. What we call a 'Calorie' is actually a 'large calorie' - written as *Cal* or more commonly as *kcal* - which is a measure of a thousand 'small calories' (written as *cal*).

One large calorie - or, in normal speak, one Calorie (1 kcal) - is the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1 kilo of water by 1 degree celcius.

On a gram by gram basis, you get the following energy from the following fuel sources:

* 1 gram of Fat = 9 Calories

* 1 gram of Protein = 4 Calories

* 1 gram of Carbohydrate = 4 Calories

* 1 gram of Ethanol = 7 Calories

and, as 7.9 grams of Ethanol equals 10ml of Ethanol:

* 1ml of Ethanol = 5.5 Calories

So, in a fifth (750ml/25 fl. oz.) of straight 80 proof liquor (40% Ethanol/~60% Water), you'll get:

750ml x 0.4 = 300ml Ethanol

300ml x 5.5 Calories

1650 Calories

**Alcohol Metabolism**

It's important to note though that whilst human energy sources are measured in Calories, they are certainly not equal in the sense of *how* the human body uses them, or even *can* use them.

Typically (and in layman's), the body uses Glucose (or Ketones) for energy. Consumed Fat/Protein/Carbohydrate (F/P/C) will be broken down, and a large proportion of these energy sources will be converted into Glucose, as well as Glycerol and Free Fatty Acids, etc, with their levels increasing in proportion to the amount of Calories consumed. When there is an excess of Calories consumed, that's when the body mashes the excess together and stores it as Fat ([Adipose Tissue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue)).

Ethanol, though, is used differently by the body.

First, when Ethanol is present, this is what the body (via the Liver, mainly) switches to as its primary energy source. That roughly means that other energy sources (e.g. F/P/C) will not be used till all of the Ethanol has been metabolised, if they are used at all.

Secondly, whilst Ethanol isn't in itself toxic (well, *kinda*…), it's first metabolite (what it's broken down into) - [Acetaldehyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde) - is… and, relative to alcohol, I've read that it's ~30 times more toxic.

But, anyway:

Ethanol is broken down by the enzyme [Alcohol Dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dehydrogenase) into Acetaldehyde.

Acetaldehyde is toxic, an irritant, and a carcinogen. Put it in humans, and it will fuck their shit up. It causes nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, confusion, fatigue, incoordination, memory impairment, swelling, flushing of the skin, etc. It's one of the main causing factors of hangovers.

Luckily, the body is prepared for this metabolite, and quickly tries to break it down before too much damage is done. People have argued this is why the liver prioritises Ethanol over other fuel sources (i.e. humans that didn't prioritise Ethanol all died off). The body also uses antioxidants, such as Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) and Vitamin C, to deal with the Acetaldehyde (hence why these vitamins help with hangovers but, more importantly, this a reason for why CAs can incur a deficiency in these vitamins).

But, again, anyway:

Acetaldehyde is broken down by the enzyme [Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde_dehydrogenase) into Acetic Acid.

Actually, I'm going to take a break here to go back to Acetaldehyde.

I've mentioned what it does to the body. If you're familiar with [Alcohol Flush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction) (e.g. Asian Flush/Asian Glow), where a person's face will go bright red after drinking alcohol, this is a reaction due to there being too much Acetaldehyde within said person's system.

This is commonly seen in Far Eastern Asians due to a 'defective' [allele](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele) or absent [isozyme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isozyme) of (at least) one of the aforementioned first two enzymes responsible for alcohol metabolism.

Most commonly this is a problem that is found to lie with the *second* enzyme involved - Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase - thus meaning that the Acetaldehyde is not metabolised fast enough into Acetic Acid, causing a (relatively rapid) rising accumulation of Acetaldehyde. However, the issue may lie with the *first* enzyme involved - Alcohol Dehydrogenase - thus meaning that Ethanol is too rapidly metabolised into Acetaldehyde, again causing the aforementioned (relatively rapid) rising accumulation of Acetaldehyde.

The long-short of it is that, besides the flushing reaction, other symptoms (i.e. many of those that one would associate with a hangover) will also affect the sufferer. Unsurprisingly, this typically leads to a lower rate of alcoholism amongst those affected by this reaction… though, in my own experience, it rarely ends their night.

If you don't suffer from these reactions but want to know what it all feels like, get yourself a prescription to [Disulfiram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram) (Antabuse) or [Calcium Carbimide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbimide) (Temposil) [FYI, the latter is a safer medication from all reports I have read]. These drugs interfere with the function of the second enzyme - Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase - meaning that once Ethanol is metabolised into Acetaldehyde, it hangs around for far longer and in far larger quantities (~750% larger) than it would normally. With these drugs in your system (I *believe* a dose of Antabuse is effective for up to 12 hours, Temposil for up to 8 hours), and after an exposure to Ethanol, you should start to feel very hungover within ~15 minutes. Personally, I think these drugs are dangerous and change nothing within the mind of an addict, but if you are thinking of quitting they *do* help some people… you'd have to be a masochist to take such drugs on the regular and still drink, assuming they affect you as intended.

Anyway, back to the metabolic route:

**Ethanol --&gt; + Alcohol Hydrogenase --&gt; Acetaldehyde --&gt; + Acetaldehyde Hydrogenase --&gt; Acetic Acid (aka, Acetate)**

[Acetate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate) is harmless, and is then further broken down into [Acetyl-CoA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetyl-CoA), which the body uses for energy or to produce Ketones. This is where the majority (let's say ~95% for simplicity's sake) of *used* Ethanol calories end up.

Whilst the above all occurs at the liver, Ethanol is also metabolised (in far smaller quantities) by other parts of the body, such as the Pancreas and the Brain, which all (just like the Liver) sustain damage by doing so. 

Note: besides the enzymes I have listed above, [CYP2E1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1) is another enzyme involved in the process of metabolising Ethanol within the Liver.

Whilst it is commonly assumed that the liver can only metabolise *x* amount of alcohol over a set time as standard, *x* certainly varies between people, and chronic alcoholics have been shown to metabolise Ethanol at a rate as high as (I believe) *4 times* their 'normal'. This is mostly due to elevated levels of said enzymes.

Back to Calories… like I said, about 95% of used Ethanol Calories end up as Acetate. Excess Acetate cannot, and does not, end up as Fat. It, however, remains the body's primary source of energy, thus entailing that any other present sources of energy (e.g. F/P/C) maintain their 'excess' status until they are dealt with.

Less than 5% of Ethanol Calories *can* end up as stored fat, but in practice this doesn't really happen, particularly as Ethanol metabolism is a difficult process that uses a lot of energy itself.

Net result: if your diet solely consists of Ethanol Calories, and you consume (even *well*) over your needed level (e.g. 3000 Calories of Ethanol, compared to your needed 2000 Calories a day), you will not gain weight.

However: if you add in other energy sources, and there is an excess of Calories, then this excess (from the other energy sources) will be ultimately be converted to stored fat, or it will simply be passed as waste.

Also, keep in mind that I am strictly only talking about *Ethanol* calories when it comes to Alcoholic beverages. If your source of Ethanol contains other energy sources (e.g. Carbohydrates), then these other energy sources will be treated separately. Thus, drinks like sugary cocktails or beer or whatever are far more likely to cause weight gain than drinking low sugar alcoholic drinks like wine, or (basically) nil sugar alcoholic drinks like straight liquor.

----

Anyway, that's what I wanted to write about Ethanol being used as a source of energy.

1341187656.0	vwepu	Why you need to go to Korea.  Place is made for drinkers.	stupidlyugly	97	8	37	"Most of you know I spent a stint living in Korea in the 90s.  This is probably the definitive place that started me down the road to true alcoholism.  I *thought* I drank before I went to Korea.  Things changed...a LOT.  

My apartment in Korea was 180 square feet and not considered small.  Nobody stays in at night.  

Let's describe a typical Saturday.  And by this, I mean none of these events, or number of different activities in one day is extraordinary, and since you don't pay rent in Korea, money really isn't a problem.  All prices are mid 1990s prices, so inflate accordingly.

Let's start with a Korean baseball game.  I was a huge fan of the Pusan Lotte Giants.  Now, technically, alcohol is prohibited at Korean baseball games (nudge, nudge, wink, wink).  But as it happens, there are hundreds of little tents right outside the stadium selling juice boxes  of soju for about a buck fifty.  You buy several of these and shove them in your pockets, down your socks, down your pants, what have you.  The military police ""searching"" you on entry understand and won't give you shit about it.

You go into the game, and see 30,000 people at a giant drunken shit show.  Old ladies start dancing on top of the Giants' dugout.  People throw bottles on the field in disgust when the Giants fuck up.  There are HUUGE sing alongs of Korean patriotic songs between innings.  Very few people can see after the seventh.

OK.  Game's over.  Get yourself a bottle of Aspa at the local convenience store.  Stuff is essentially liquid caffeine and nicotine for $2.50.  It helps get you through the long night ahead.

Time to hit the beer bar.  Now, you could go ordering the 500ml beers for a buck fifty each, but Koreans will call you a pussy for this.  You order *minimum* a 3L pitcher.  Most places have 5L pitchers, and many have 10L containers with little spigots.  You HAVE TO order food in the beer bar.  They won't serve you otherwise.  Consider this a $10 cover charge for your table.

Bars close at midnight in Korea (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).  Beer bars will kick you out.  Thing is, it's perfectly acceptable to buy alcohol at 7-11 after midnight.  So you've got a few choices here.  Sometimes, 7-11 will set up tables and camping stoves right out front.  You go in, buy soju for 50 cents for a 375ml bottle (22-25%abv) and a bag of frozen sliced meat.  You sit outside 7-11 drinking and cooking and having a grand time.

Orrrr, you hit up the soju room.  These are little one-room bars who pay off the police and hang black garbage bags in the windows after midnight, or are located in basements.  They have soju for two bucks, and amazing drinking food for $5-10.  If you get to know the lady running the soju room, you eventually get up and take bottles of soju out of the fridge yourself and she charges you based on the number of empties at the end of your stay.  If you puke on the floor, she'll get pissed and hit you, but won't cut you off.  You're just making room to spend more money with her, right?

Orrrr, you hit up the soju tent.  These are particularly popular in summer, but are fantastic in winter as they have oil heaters in the middle.  They're orange tents that you go in, and each one will have a food specialty.  My favorite had roasted duck on a stick for $10.  Soju is slightly more expensive than soju rooms, but not much.

Fucking hell!  It's 3am!  Where to go now?  The Karaoke, of course!  Unlike their Japanese counterparts, Korean Karaokes have private rooms, so you get one appropriate to the size of your party.  This will be the most expensive venture of your night.  They serve beer and whiskey, no soju.  Beers ran about $4 and whiskey was several hundred.  Girls LOOOOVE going to the Karaoke late at night.

8am!  Time to go!  You walk up the stairs from your basement Karaoke, invariably facing east, and meet the rising sun piercing your very soul.  The pain!  Remedy?  Time to go to the beach (which hopefully, you're already at) to the incoming fishing boats.  They'll sell you live fish right off the boat.  They kill it, put it in a plastic bag, and you walk it across the street to one of the sushi restaurants.

The sushi restaurant will take your fish, cut it up, and serve it to you with the head still moving with side dishes of spicy hangover soup and bowls of milky white rice wine.  This venture will run your party $50 (fish included).

You're drunk and hungover at the same time.  The sun is up, you're fed, and you're hurting.  Go sweat it out and sleep it off at the Korean bath.  You'll get out of there around 3 in the afternoon, when you hit up a seafood restaurant and some soothing, soothing rice wine.

Hit up the beer bar Sunday night, and try to get to bed before midnight because you've got to work in the morning.  But don't worry too much.  If you don't come into work with a raging hangover most of the time, the boss will become suspicious.  It's a sign of weakness if you don't drink.  This is where my liter of scotch each work night at the bar began.  (I had benefactors for that, cuz fuck $100 a bottle for that shit).

Keep in mind that you never have to worry about driving.  The subway runs until midnight (it's common to see businessmen passed out and/or puking on the subway at night), and the cabs are cheap and plentiful (I hear this isn't the case in Seoul).

Oh, and public intoxication laws?  Don't exist.  I quite literally stumbled into a police station once inquiring about a restroom.  They laughed and pointed me in the right direction.  I did my thing, and went on my merry way.  No problem at all.

They're nice and friendly, treat us like normal good people even when we buy two handles of vodka at 9am on a Wednesday.  They know your name and you know theirs and it's always great to see them.  These brave men and women deal with us at our best and at our worst.  They know if we're single or married, if we have kids, our favorite football team and other small details to make polite conversation with.  

They don't act weird when we often show up five minutes after opening or five minutes before closing.  Is a liter on sale for the price of a fifth but you failed to notice?  Don't worry, your friendly liquor store clerk will alert you to the deal you're missing out on.  Are you obviously drunk and they're not supposed to be selling to you?  No problem, just don't make a scene and they'll always complete your transaction.  If it's a Friday or Saturday they'll make you feel normal by saying ""you look like you're about to have some fun, I'd love to party with you"".  When your hand is trembling while signing the credit card slip, they never notice.  They do so much for us, yet ask nothing in return.

It is for all these reasons and more that I salute the great liquor store clerks of the world.  Please feel free to share specific or general experiences with these modern day heroes."	t5_2s68b	True
1350370915.0	11k61o	Clicked the random button and ended up here. You fuckers remind me of my Dad	dustbin3	117	24	28	"So i stumbled here and read through and then decided to write something down in my journal. After writing it, I figured I would share it here with you.  He would have liked you guys. 

•	10/16/2012 1:50AM Thinking about my dad, how he was an alcoholic and always had been.  Came across a subreddit called Crippling Alcoholism and I read some of the people talking and it reminded me of him.  These people have accepted what they are and shared in the misery and joy with one another.  I know he fought it his whole life, but one common thread among those people is that they knew they were fucking their bodies, but they made the choice.  I wished right then I could show him that, let him read the man who wrote in almost poetic fashion about holes in his socks, a trash can full of glass bottles, his half drank 6 pack and the one that awaited him after. 

 I read about things I hadn't taken the time to consider and realized that we would never have any talks like that.  Never will I ever just accept his choices and not put the guilt on him.  I will never be able to joke about it with him and share a laugh about how he’s wrecking his insides.  He knew well he couldn't be himself.  His self wasn't good enough for anyone.  No one would accept what he was or what he chose to do, so he did it alone and that makes me sad.  I wish he had lived long enough for me to accept him.  I feel the same way a lot of times.  I don’t believe in the god lie, but if I were to be close to any of my family members I would have to pretend.  They would never accept me as I am, they would only want to change me. Just like I wanted to change him.  But people don’t change because you want them to, they change because they want to.  Anyway, we all go out kicking and screaming and its an odd thing to sit and wish I could tell my dad I am ok with the thing that killed him, but that is what I find myself wanting to do.  Of course it isn't just about alcohol, it’s about him and loving him and supporting him no matter what.  

It’s weird because the people we love, we love in spite of their flaws, but we take it upon ourselves to try and fix what we deem is wrong, which can put incredible distance between people.  If we just let that go, supported them and accepted them maybe that’s what they need instead of a wagging finger.  Maybe that would be more effective than ripping a picture down and replacing it with a beer can.  Chalk it up to another lesson learned. "	t5_2s68b	True

I hate even going to the grocery store because I have to {shudder} interact.

When I drink, I love everyone and everything.

I want to meet *all* the people and go *all* the places.

But they don't love me back.  

Now *I'm* the stupid and the evil.  And they shun me.

1346434939.0	z58rg	CAs and Moderation/Abstinence		102	17	17	"The purpose of this thread is to provide a resource of information for CAs looking for advice on moderation or abstinence.

Please note, you will not receive any medical advice from this resource, only the personal thoughts of others. If you have serious questions about your health and forward planning, please see a doctor.

To reiterate: **please see a doctor.**

---

r/CA is a great sub for receiving support for withdrawal, tapering, moderation, and temporary abstinence. However, it is not a recovery sub, and for those looking for help on quitting drinking for life - particularly those without preexisting ties to this sub - you may find better support elsewhere.

---

**Withdrawal**

For dealing with specific [withdrawal symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal#Signs_and_symptoms), you are best advised to see a doctor or, if that is not possible, to ask the sub directly.

If you need to withdraw, then again, please try to see a doctor. Alcohol withdrawal can be fatal or permanently damaging, and is absolutely no joke.

You should also be aware of [Kindling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_%28substance_withdrawal%29#Alcohol). This is a phenomena that, in the simplest terms, means that after each withdrawal - particularly those withdrawals that are sudden and harsh - you are more likely to become physically dependent when you return to drinking, and with the symptoms appearing sooner and harder each time.

Again, you should see a doctor for advice, and most likely (if appropriate) so as to receive [benzos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Alcohol_withdrawal) in order to withdraw from alcohol in a controlled, gentle, and safe fashion.

If you cannot see a doctor, and you are not more than very familiar with how to withdraw by using benzos (if the appropriate types and dosages are even available to you), then your best advice is to taper.

There is a [guide to tapering](http://hamsnetwork.org/taper/) in the sidebar.

Alternatively, you can determine your average daily alcohol intake (based on a week's intake) using [this table](http://i.imgur.com/j2aFj.png) that I made. [1 Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_unit) is the equivalent of 10ml of ethanol.

My advice would be to determine that average, determine what 10% of it would be, and then reduce your alcohol intake by that amount, starting with the average intake figure on day one, over the following 10 days.

Thus, if your average intake is 30 units a day, you would drink 30 units on the first day, 27 on the next day, 24 on the next, and so on, until you reach zero on the eleventh day. The aim is to space your drinks out throughout the day. Saving 24 units for when you go to bed is a terrible idea. You drink your dosage when you *need* to, throughout the day, or you don't drink it at all.

Once you have tapered to zero, it will take some weeks of abstinence before you start to feel somewhat normalised, and it might even be months before you start to feel 100%. Be aware that if you take [benzos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_benzodiazepines#Benzodiazepine_half-life_and_equivalent_dose_table) or [z-drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-drug) during this time of 'abstinence' then you are not really being abstinent, and may only be extending your withdrawal, due to these drugs' cross-tolerance with ethanol via the [GABAa receptor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA#Examples).

Please keep good nutrition during any withdrawal, and also try your hardest to get decent rest and sleep.

---

**Abstinence**

r/CA is a great sub for support if you are looking to take a temporary break. 

However, there are other subs and websites out there that you may find more helpful, particularly if you are seeking support for permanent abstinence.

On Reddit:

* [r/StopDrinking](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/new/?sort=new) - a recovery group sub.

* [r/Alcoholism](http://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/new/?sort=new) - a resource/info sub.

* [r/RedditorsInRecovery](http://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/new/?sort=new) - like a mixture of the above two, but it isn't specific to alcoholism.

Outside of Reddit, here are obviously a lot of addiction forums to consider, like these two:

* [Sober Recovery](http://www.soberrecovery.com/forums/)

* [Cyber Recovery](http://www.cyberrecovery.net/forums/)

For IRL support, these are some secular organisations:

* [Smart Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/)

* [Save Our Selves](http://www.sossobriety.org/)

* [Life Ring](http://lifering.org/)

These are two support groups that are not abstinence-focused, but rather moderation-focused:

* [Moderation Management](http://www.moderation.org/)

* [Sinclair Method](http://www.thesinclairmethod.net/community/) - Note, this forum is specifically for those taking the medication [Naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Method).

Finally, these are some resources of information that I'd advise visiting:

* [HAMS Network](http://hamsnetwork.org/) - lots of good articles to read.

* [Drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/condition/alcohol-dependence.html) - anecdotes regarding alcohol dependence medications.

* [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/drugs/condition-996-Habit%20of%20Drinking%20Too%20Much%20Alcohol.aspx?diseaseid=996&amp;diseasename=Habit+of+Drinking+Too+Much+Alcohol&amp;source=3) - similar to the above.

---

**Medications**

There are some specific medications that you may find help with moderation and/or abstinence:

* [Naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone) - Opioid receptor antagonist. Proven efficacy with reducing impulsive/binge/addictive behaviours, including alcoholism. The mechanism of action of this drug isn't clearly understood, but it absolutely does work for many people. As an aside, I believe it is soon to receive FDA approval in the US so as to be indicated for gambling addictions. Also, don't forget the above mention of the Sinclair Method - subscribers to this type of moderation claim that Naltrexone is best used *alongside* exposure to alcohol. Important note: due to the mechanism of Naltrexone's opioid antagonism, opioids/opiates will lose their efficacy *dramatically*. If you suffer from chronic pain and rely on opioid painkillers to manage it, then Naltrexone is not for you. Also, Naltrexone is not alcohol specific, and you may find yourself experiencing less excitement or enjoyment of certain activities (such as gambling or eating, etc).

* [Acamprosate (Campral)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acamprosate) - NMDA receptor antagonist. Specifically used to help maintain alcohol abstinence and with proven efficacy. Campral is sometimes given *during* withdrawal so as to reduce symptoms (with mixed reports regarding its efficacy). There are many recommendations for its use as an augmenter to Naltrexone for those suffering from other addictions alongside alcoholism.

* [Disulfiram (Antabuse)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfiram) and [Calcium Carbimide (Temposil)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbimide) - These drugs block the enzyme [Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde_dehydrogenase), which leads to a fast build up (e.g. 7 times that of normal) of [Acetaldehyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde#Alcohol). Users will find that, after taking these drugs, if they expose themselves to alcohol they will suffer from extremely unpleasant effects. Temposil is usually recommended over Antabuse due to its reduced sensitivity (alcohol is found in many places besides the bottle) and shorter length of effect (I believe 8 hours vs. 12).

Those are the major drugs used for alcohol abstinence. However, others to consider are:

* [Baclofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclofen)

* [Topiramate (Topamax)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topiramate)

* [Ondansetron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odansetron)

* [Clonidine (Catapres)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonidine)

---

**Moderation**

Many CAs will tell you that moderation is impossible. It might be for yourself, it might not.

Here are some tips:

* Switch to lower ABV drinks and/or dilute your drinks with water (or any other non-moreish liquid).

* Avoid buying rounds for your friends; avoid your friends buying rounds for you. Drink at your own pace.

* Put limits on your cash.

* Don't do shots.

* Avoid mixing in stimulants, e.g. caffeine, amphetamines, cocaine. These only mask how drunk you are, and when they drop off so will you.

* Don't drink on an empty stomach. If possible, eat *whilst* you drink, also.

* Determine a personal indicator for when you've had too much, and look out for it. Stop drinking at that point.

* Whilst drinking, avoid slipping into [minimalisation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimisation_%28psychology%29) about your drinking and its consequences.

* Always keep a low ABV drink in your hand. This may help fend off higher ABV drinks.

* Try new drinks; avoid drinks with which you have a history of passing out from.

* Set yourself a task for the next day that'll require you to be functional. Use that as motivation to pace down your drinking whilst drinking.

* Keep an eye on the clock.

* Get a prescription to [Naltrexone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naltrexone).

* Keep yourself busy with things like: Sharing moments with someone you love. Enjoying great music/TV/films/fiction/non-fiction. Trying something new. Taking up old hobbies. Making exciting plans. Keeping good nutrition and hygiene. Exercise. Getting good sleep.

* [A good thread for other moderation tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/rbtcw/a_good_way_to_moderate_intake/).

---

Anyway, best of luck with whatever your goal is... and remember that if you want to drink, r/CA will accept you, and if you want to quit, r/CA will support you.

1342623406.0	wrf9h	Worst nightmare came true.	BigBadKitty	112	23	29	So. Went through detox and rehab. Stayed clean about a month or so. Then, relapsed. So bad that I blacked out (fuck me running, haven't blacked out since I was a friggin kid). My 11yo daughter, who was home with me at the time, called her father and said come get me, mommy is drunk. He came to get her and called 911 because I was so fucked up. So since the cops showed up, DCFS got involved, and they placed her with him. They took my baby away from me. I'm fucking dying here. They said they will return her if and when I get some sobriety under my belt. Yet here I sit, drunk as fuck at 10AM, crying and feeling like she'd be better off without me. I'm too much of a coward to do anything drastic, but I sure wish I wouldn't wake up sometimes. Why the fuck can't I stop?	t5_2s68b	True

1330999368.0	qjhsr	Another reason our lives are far more interesting than those boring sober people: The inexplicable findings our mornings have to offer.	Gin_Intoxic	97	8	91	"**TL;DR - Puppy Cereal**

We've all seen the ""Morning questions"" posts on here - ""Where's my wallet??"" ""Why am I on the floor?"" ""Who did I call/text?"" ""Is that piss?"" ""WHOSE FUCKING HOUSE IS THIS?"".... We all have those days. A lot.

Well this morning I thought about another lovely facet to our morning routines. I can only call it the ""The Fuck?"" event. When you see evidence of something you apparently did, that you simply can't explain. Sober, drunk, even with video evidence, what you are seeing can not be explained by reason or rationale. 

This morning started like every other: Wake up feeling groggy, let the dog out, smoke a cigarette, get ready for work... Only this morning, after getting ready for work, I walk into the kitchen, look down at the dog bowl, and literally said ""The Fuck?"" out loud. The bowl was not only filled with dog food, but was also filled to the brim with water. The food was a soggy, inflated mess floating around in water. (I smelled it to make sure it wasn't piss or beer... Pretty sure it was water.) 

I stood there for at least 45 seconds just staring at this enigma, with my head tilted in the same way I'm sure my dog's was while doing this stupid shit, wondering what in the fuck could have possibly gone through my mind to think this was a good idea. I had nothing. Neither did the dog. She just looked up at me like ""Yeah dude, you did that. Fuck if I know why.""

Having to get my ass to work, I quickly dumped the soggy mess out in the grass, refilled the bowl with food, gave the little girl a treat and said my apologies, and went to work. All day long I have been trying to explain this shit to myself and have come up with exactly nothing. 

I think life would be far less interesting without these moments. Who really wants to wake up every day and not have something to question?

tuesday I did nothing but play videogames and watch fringe and short films. 

wednesday I helped my neighbor fill a hole in his yard (long story i wont go into the details.) After done with the work, I ate some food, took a shower (true story!) then went to go frisbee golfing with the neighbor and his roommate. 

We get to the golf course and I had 3 beers. First alcohol I had since sunday night, I felt fine. 3 beers, on the third discgolf hole I bend down to get my disc and see an extremely vivid rainbow...thing. It was brighter than any hallucination I have ever had.  

Next thing I know, I'm in the emergency room covered in wires, IV shit in my arms and a lump on my head like it was giving birth to a softball. My glasses were gone, my mom is crying and I had no clue what happened.  

My neighbors had told the EMT's that I started rambling incoherently about rainbows, then went into a seizure, fell down, swallowed my tongue and turned blue in the face. I found it odd because I thought seizures made you bite your tongue, not swallow it. 

After a ton of tests the doctors determined I was extremely dehydrated, malnourished and have an ""extra heartbeat.""  

They also said I had a liver enzyme test thing, but wouldn't give me any details.  

The point of me telling this story however, is to say I am going to attempt to ""taper"" off of r/ca. I honestly feel it will be harder than tapering off alcohol or any other chemical. I think I seriously have to do something about this though. I came very close to dying yesterday. Only one person in the disc golf group knew that they had to pull my tongue out of my throat. If it weren't for him I most likely would have died.  

So I'm sorry if I'm around less than I already have been lately, it just seems like it's for the best for now, until I can figure out my shit better.

1366747410.0	1cyhx4	My experience on Naltrexone	Not_Chris	92	7	57	"I hope this doesn't sound too much r/stopdrinking, but I figured ya'll might be interested in how this is going for me. Feel free to ask me any questions either in comments or by PM. Sorry this is so long, but I suck at being concise.

**My backstory:** Heavy drinker since 18. There was always some problems because of my drinking (blackouts, being asshole, the usual college kid stuff). I wasn't physically dependent though. Diagnosed with PTSD at 22 and became a full blown alcoholic for a few months. Moved in with a significant other and turned into a ""high functioning alcoholic"" mixed with bouts of physical dependence for about a year and a half. She got tired of dealing with my drinking + other things so she moved out. 

I made 1 honest attempt while living with her to stop drinking completely. It lasted 45 days, but I was miserable. Our relationship was already shot at this point. Not drinking is really boring and sucked. 

When she moved out, back to full blown alcoholic with no intention of really slowing down until health problems. At this point I am drinking 12-24 standard drinks a day and sometimes more on benders.

**Hearing about Naltrexone:** I decided to get my first physical in 4 years in February. I figured I really needed to get my liver function test. I told the doctor I drink 50-80 drinks a week. He said if I keep it up, I will probably vomit blood. He wanted me to go on Naltrexone then. He said I wouldn't have to stop drinking completely, but it would turn me into a much more moderate drinker. I told him I was having too much fun drinking a ton and I would think about it next year. 

**Deciding to go on Naltrexone:** I was on a particularly great bender in late March. 5 days straight of 20-30+ drinks a day. I tried to taper down on my own. I had a seizure on night 3 of tapering. I guess I didn't drink enough. This scared the shit out of me since I live by myself and I really don't want to die. I knew I don't have the willpower/desire to stop drinking completely, so I decided it was time to try modern medicine.

**The doctor's visit:** Since he already knew how much I drank from the physical, this was pretty straight forward. I told him I had a change of heart about my drinking. My doctor told me he was going to put me on Vivitrol which is an injection of extended release Naltrexone that lasts a month. He said he had 100% success using the drug so far with his alcoholic patients. I also got some Ativan for my withdrawal. Insurance was cool and covered the injection.

**Week 1:** I didn't notice any changes the first 2 days. The third day something weird happened. I was on my 6th Beast Ice and had finished half of it. I suddenly lost all interest in finishing it. I poured it out and just went to bed. This has never happened to me before. 
The rest of the weekdays I would plan on getting super drunk, but then I would end up drinking about 5-6 drinks. I would just lose interest in getting drunk while drinking. 
The weekend came and I drank a lot but nowhere near the level I used to on weekends. I didn't blackout and the withdrawal on Sunday was really minor.   
-I think I ended up drinking like 70ish drinks that week.

**Week 2:** This is when I began noticing *BIG* changes. For one thing my hands stopped shaking. I forgot what that was like.
I drank 4-5 drinks a night most nights. Finishing a drink became harder and harder. I had to mentally commit to it. There was a night where I only had 2.5 drinks.
When the weekend came I only had like 10-20 drinks each day. My tolerance was notably down. On Sunday, I only had 2 drinks total and didn't even need them for tapering.   
-I think I had about 50 total drinks this week. 
 
**Week 3:** The trend continued. I was only drinking 2-3 drinks a night. I even went 24 hours without drinking. 
The weekend came and I was surrounded by my heavy drinker friends. I only ended up drinking about 10-15 drinks a day. On Sunday I decided to not drink.   
-I think I ended up having 40ish drinks this week.

**Week 4:** This is present day now. I didn't drink on Monday. I don't plan on drinking tonight or tomorrow. I think I will end up drinking Thursday and this weekend.


**Side effects:** The needle they use for the injection is a big mother fucker. It made my butt sore for the first few days. Around week 2, the soreness in my butt came back and the injection site felt hard. This made me walk funny for a few days, but then cleared up. I also woke up a few times in week 3 with joint pain in my knees, that made it very painful to walk. These are all possible side effects that are listed on the paper you get with the injection.    

I have also noticed some not so serious side effects. I lose interest in smoking cigarettes and eating meals halfway through. It takes longer to orgasm during sex. Sometimes I don't even get a happy ending. The orgasm thing isn't nearly as severe as when I was on Lexapro. On Lexapro, I had trouble even jacking off.

**Future:**I plan on staying on Naltrexone for the next few months at least (maybe longer). I am going to talk to my doctor about switching to the pill instead of the injection. This is mainly because the lump in my butt thing scared me and I don't want to go through that scare once a month.

Drinking is still fun, but it doesn't have nearly the consequences as before. I haven't sweat the bed, my shakes stopped, I don't have to drink anymore, I haven't blacked out, and I generally feel like I am in better health. I plan on still drinking, but I don't really want to go back to the 12-24 drinks a day range.

Anyways let me know if you have any questions. Cheers!"	t5_2s68b	True

i take a megabus from austin (free!) then city train towards him, i barley catch the fucking last train of the night (pulls up as ticket is being printed) and head towards him only to find out the last stop is still 21 miles away from him.

he calls a bunch of people and tries to find me a ride but everyone says no, its getting cold so i say fuck it, it's almost midnight so ima just grab some tall cans and sit in my sleeping bag in a bush and drink away the cold until tommorow when i can catch a train.

i walk over to the bush and get ready to drink when my body tells me i dont have enough booze so i go back to get one more tall can and as im rolling a smoke in front of the store some random older black gentleman looks up at me as he throws away a man can of beast ice.

""you need a ride""

""yes""

""do you have beer""

""yes""

""get in""

Everyone who put this together wants to know if anyone would be opposed to giving out raw data for others' individual analysis of the data. There are some great things you can do with it if you're into that kind of stuff.

I might make a toned down version of it on an open platform like google if there is enough demand for it. One thing you could probably do is download http://www.openoffice.org/download . That's an open source platform you can use and my guess is that it'd work for this.

Thanks again for everyone who helped put the questions together and brainguy for making a more detailed study for future release (look out for it!).

I was thinking ""fuck shit I've been drinking too much of his booze he's caught on fuck I'm fucked I need to find the nearest train out of here quick.""

So I take the shots in front of him, keep doing my job and serving people, then after close he tells me ""Finish the dishes, pull the drawer, run the batch, count our deposit in front of me."" So I do, still with trepidation thinking he's about to say ""Well that's the last money you'll make me."" 

Turns out, he was making sure Ol' Ironsides [my liver] is still able to function while I'm shitcanned, and after I show him that we're 4 dollars over on the drawer, he extends a hand and says ""You've made us more money and worked harder than any other employee I've had in the year we've been open. Want to be bar manager?"" 

I'm taken aback, and he can tell. I get a shit eating grin and say ""Hell yes.""

So now I have a much bigger workload, however I get salary on top of the tips every night I work, get to pick my shifts, get to pick whoever's working at the bar, and get to be the watchdog for people like me. On top of an ongoing $25 at-cost tab every night I come in to help.

My short story: After months of unemployment, I got fed up with lying, cheating and stealing to support my booze habit so I check into an inpatient program.

So about a day after my last drink, I'm shaking and sweating in my bed when I get up to take a leak -BAM- next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital two days later. I had a withdrawal induced grand mal seziure. Fuck me.

I will be taking a girl out tonight. If things go less than planned, I'll be here again but with more drink. Why is this looked down upon? I hate it man. All I want is to be alright with liking being drunk so much but it isn't okay. I'm a problem to so many people.

I'm tired of lying to myself that I have anything to look forward to when waiting for the next ""night out"" that turns into a bender or that I'm being ""artistic or ""bohemic"" just because it's a stylish cafe that I'm drinking at on Wednesday noon.  
If I have to get fucked up to get trough the week, so be it, but I'm not gonna fool myself any longer that it impresses anyone how chaotic my life is or how much I can drink. I'm no longer 16, I've stopped improving my social standing by drinking hard with everyone who wants to a long time ago and I'm rejecting that mentality as of this moment.  
From now on I'm gonna do all the boring things that make my life look better on paper even if it makes me disgusted with myself. Hell, I'm even going to find myself a boring girlfriend just to make it official.   
Fuck it, I may have a hollow shell where a normal person's hopes, feelings and dreams should be, but I'm smart enough to fake it. Because I can't live a life that would be true to my crippled self, it's just too fucking sad.

What I'm trying to say here is that I'm stripping my drinking of all pretense to romanticism, adventurousness or perception that it somehow enriches me. From now on, I'm going to see my reaching for booze as a pure act of weakness instead of using lame excuses to justify it. It's time to grow up and face reality which is that I can't live how I used to any longer. Like I said, I'm not going to start counting the days I've been ""clean"", but I'll sure as hell stop saying ""Bro, that night was EPIC!"" just because I got too drunk to walk.

Sorry for being a buzzkill, but that's just something I had to realize and I have a feeling that I'm not alone in that situation. Besides, I always value your thoughts."	t5_2s68b	True

1347761088.0	zyc2k	I dodged a bullet last night.	Nonyabiness	100	20	100	"So I've been on this diet for about a week now where I'm actually eating healthy food rather than frozen pizzas and Wendy's all the time. Although, like most of us I start to crave fast food when I'm drunk, I have been doing really well with just eating some carrots or pistachios. Keep this information in mind.

Last night I'm hanging out with my roommate playing Dark Souls and drinking vodka tonics, we are having a real nice time. He ends up passing out on the couch, so I continue my venture into Sen's Fortress (in the game) and having a ball. Before I know it, I'm saying screw it to the tonic water and just chugging the vodka. It's around 4:30 a.m. and I'm starving. I go to the fridge and all I see is fucking vegetables and eggs. Any sober/healthy person would be delighted at the sight, but I'm sick of it. I want something unhealthy.

Now I've been really good about drinking and driving. By that, I mean that I don't do it often, and I stay at home if I'm too drunk. Well last night everything went out the window.

I drove to McDonald's. In my drunken stupor, I order like two sausage mcmuffins, some hot cakes, hash browns, the whole nine yards. Everything is fine until I'm driving back home and I hit something. It was a huge fucking rock in the middle of the god damned road. I hit it so perfectly that it dented the inside of my rim. 

So the tire pops and all I can think of is ""I'm going to jail"". It's dark as fuck out and I'm drunk, so changing a tire is going to be a challenge, but I go at it anyways.

About 10 minutes into it, I'm just mad and too broke to call a towing service and then I see the lights. Cherries and berries. All that is going through my mind at this time is ""I'm going to jail"".

The Sheriff Deputy helps me change the tire (which was a real pain in the ass). We bullshit a bit and I'm just being friendly, making dick jokes and shit. Once we finish the job he brings up the fact that my license is suspended. I told him there was no food in the house and I needed some breakfast. He tells me to pull the truck further off the highway and offers me a ride home.

Upon arriving at my house he tells me he knows I'm too drunk to drive, but he says that since I've been ""really cool"" he decided to give me a mulligan. ""If I catch you again, I'll be driving you to jail instead of your house"", he says. I thank him profusely, shake his hand and he drove off into the sunrise.

I dodged a huge bullet last night. I already have a DUI from about a decade ago and this guy really put things into perspective for me. I'm seriously never driving drunk again. I can't afford to and I couldn't live with myself if I hurt someone. That, and I think someone upstairs wanted to make sure I stick to my diet. Asshole. 

**TL;DR**; Got sick of eating healthy food so I drove drunk to McD's, popped my tire on a huge rock on the way home, the Deputy figured changing my tire was punishment enough and let me off with a stern warning and was kind enough to drive me home."	t5_2s68b	True

How the fuck did this happen you may ask? well my awesome gf found this old house in charleston wv for $3000 we talked him down to $1,700 and he agreed to it! we borrowed the money from her mom with me promising to pay her back directly after the beet harvest im working (hopfully) in october.

now the house is in shambles but ive stayed in squats in worse shape, and we fucking own it! this is so surreal to me.

I still cant believe its true! I have not had a place to call home since i was kicked out at 16 (31 now) and now i finally have a place to keep my stuff! although at the moment all i own is a backpack but thats ok i will get stuff! im still going to travel but i actually have a place to go back to and work on when the road gets me down!

also i need a few grand to fix it up (since all the money i make at beets is going to pay her mom back), well not need. ill live in squalor i dont give a fuck. but i would like to make it a nice home for us.

can anyone suggest a kickstarter type site where i can make some cash to start working on MY NEW FUCKING HOUSE!

also, any ca's in charleston wv?

From what I remember I had fun. It's what I don't remember that is awful. I woke up in my apt., naked with the bathtub running and overflowing. I was in a lot of pain and there was blood matted across the side of my head.  

My friend showed up shortly after and told me what happened. Apparently after I blacked out, I screamed at a 10 year old girl that she was an alien and proceeded to start punching her in the face.  

This is not me. I never get violent unless someone truly deserves it. Even moreso I never get violent when black out drunk. I just cry and yell and make a fool of myself. So this scares me a lot.  

So after I was pulled off the kid the other party goers proceeded to beat the ever loving shit out of me. Then they stomped my glasses into dust. Then one guy pulled out a knife and said they should cut my throat and leave me in the cornfeild behind the house.  

Thankfully my friend stepped in, explained I was just a drunk and instead of killing me they went with cutting off my hair. I haven't cut my hair in 7 years so it is a bit dear to me. Or ""was"" I guess I should say.  

So no long hair, plenty of scrapes and bruises and 1-2 cracked ribs (hard to tell if they are cracked or just bruised) and lost a few potential friends over the weekend. Not to mention the fear of what other monstrosities are lurking in my subconscious.  

No internet until next monday night as well, so I may not respond to any coments right away but I will get to you all eventually. Not sure what the point of this post is for really other than to tell a sad and messed up story. Much love to you all."	t5_2s68b	True

A Miller tall-boy to my right.  A half &amp; half screwdriver to my left.  A carton of cowboy-killers on my desk.

This is the first time in a month I've cracked a beer and untwisted the top to a handle of vodka that sat proudly above the bottom shelf.  I feel normal.  I feel good.  I have nothing to do today.  The sunlight streams in through my window as I sip my beer and I know when I finish it there will be more waiting for me.  

I thank my hard-working sober self for gifting me with a windfall of a tax return.  Money that I will use to buy copious amounts of booze with.  For the first time in many moons I feel normal.  I feel *right*.  

I usually don't booze in the morning but today is special.  My life is good.  I have a decent paying job locked in that I will go to in a month.  I am no longer in a shitty-dead-end-relationship.  So I'm going to enjoy this drunken Monday to its fullest.  A couple more drinks and I'm gonna order a meatlover's pizza, some buffalo wings, and cheesy garlic bread. 

After I eat my fill and drink my fill I am going to pass out in a drunken haze.  

Today is a great fucking day.  Because I know that tomorrow I will have more to drink.  And the day after.  And the day after that.

So as I raise a can in my right hand and a glass in my left, while a menthol burns down on my window-sill, I proudly toast all you fuckers.

Small request from mods. Sidebar thing saying that this is not a fucking contest. Some I've noticed seem to think this is a contest to see who can drink more hard core and I think that is something that needs to be destroyed.

1374012921.0	1ig0as	I raise my glass to nonjudgmental doctors	brainguy	87	6	41	"Like many of us I have a palpable fear of doctors and what they will tell me. I know what I am doing is destroying my body and I've always tried to avoid lectures from teetotaler doctors about the 'dangers of alcoholism' and especially considering some of the horror stories I've read on this sub about how doctors have treated CAs whom have been honest I have been afraid to see a doctor and be honest with them about my drinking habits. As such, it's been 3 years since I have seen a doctor.

Well, a few weeks ago I started seeing this girl and blah blah blah I decided to get tested for STD/STI's so we could fuck without condoms as she's on the pill. So I make the appointment with a new doctor and she was very nice, said something along the lines of ""Oh we like it when people come in for this, it's very responsible!"" So after I pissed in the cup she takes me into the nurse's office where I am to have blood drawn and in the last second before she leaves me with nurse I magically overcame one of my fears and blurt out ""Do you think we could also check my liver enzyme function?"" She seemed a bit confused as to why and asks me to come back with her to her office and talk, I oblige.

She starts asking why I would want these tests and I decide fuck it, I've come this far to getting this checked, something I've feared knowing the data about for years, so I tell her ""I drink way to much."" She probes a few questions and I answer, I still low balled it, ""~10 drinks per day"" I tell her, but that's a lot more honest then I've ever been in a doctor's office. She asks me some other questions about my psychological health, if I have occupational troubles, and my physical dependence; I show her my shaky hand and she feels it. All and all she is very calm, understanding, kind and most importantly to me, not judgmental at all. She also, commends me on being responsible for knowing what I am doing is bad for me and wanting to get it checked out. She asks me if I've though about quiting and if I was going to if I knew how I would do it. I tell her that I think the best strategy for me would be the [Sinclair method](http://hamsnetwork.org/naltrexone), which she had not heard of, as I absolutely refuse to see a head doctor and would never participate in a program such as AA. So we leave on good terms and she lets me know she will contact me in the future to discuss the results.

Fast forward to today, I have my follow up appointment. I come in and it's exactly what I was expecting, my dick is in perfect health but many of my liver enzymes are far to high. While we are discussing the results she isn't preachy at all, she doesn't tell me 'what I *have* to do'. She says this is what the tests say and asks me if I have a plan. She also tells me she has done some research on the treatment I told her about (she even had a journal article from The New England Journal of Medicine on her desk; bonus points) and agrees the data looked promising. 

I tell her I will not have a plan set out by the end of the discussion as I need to mill over what these tests mean and what I want to do. She informs me if I'd like she can ask around to see if she know any doctors on my insurance plan that have utilized the Sinclair Method just to speak with them, no pressure at all. I tell her I would like that.

So by the end of our discussion I tell her, I am not quite psychologically ready but at some point I will taper down to then dry out for a week or two and come back to get the blood work done again as I took these tests on my normal drinking schedule which is known to cause elevations in these enzymes without prolonged abuse (i.e. it's possible these test could come up high after a night of 'binge drinking' by a 'normal person'). Basically if I manage to get sober for a week or two and the blood work then comes in, at least closer to, the normal level this would indicate there is at least less long term damage to my liver. She agrees that is a good next step but does not pressure me to do it by any specific time. Before I leave she tells me regardless of what I do about my drinking she'd like for me to come in when I get another dose of the HPV vaccine I decided to get (which would not normally require me to see her) because she'd like to see how I am doing.

So that's where I'm at, I'm not psychologically ready to try to taper and dry out right now so that's why tonight I raise my glass to Dr. Z and nonjudgmental doctors around the world. She wants to work with me, despite how I change my life style to make sure I am as healthy as I can be and hasn't told me once I need to do anything. She hasn't made me feel the stigmas society so flippantly place on us folk. She made me feel so comfortable and safe I wanted to hug her before I left.

There's no real point to this post but I needed someone to tell. Perhaps it will inspire some of you to get your shit checked out and if you do I hope so much you find a doctor like her. As always, I fucking love you CA, Cheers!"	t5_2s68b	True

Some of you already know about this and some of you don't but pretty soon I'll be going away for a good while. I decided to make this post now because of the... unpredictable nature of things. I don't really know how this will play out but I don't want to just disappear one day with no explanation. 

Anyway, for legal reasons I am not going to say what I may or may  not have done in my past. Those of you who know me can figure it out and the rest of you can die in a fire. I'll be going to prison soon. I've known about it for about a year but because of how our judicial system works its taken a long fucking time for anything to actually happen.

Well it's finally come to a fucking head. I've got court soon. I will be cheersing you guys from the Federal Pen drinking Sangria outta the terlit. Anyway, down to the meat of it: Those of you who know me and I know you, I would really appreciate you giving me your address. I don't expect they will let me get onto a chatroom for alcoholics, so I'll have to live vicariously through you guys. Please please send me your addresses. I hope to send letters out all the goddamn time. 

Anyway. I love you guys. I know I haven't been around much lately and some of you probably don't even know who I am but some of you have been with me in the thick and the thin. Idk what things will be like when I get out in... well Idk when the fuck I'll get out. But either way,  I hope you guys are still here.

Cheers, a badass CA gave me some cash so I've got a fancy beer tonight and now I'm getting all emotional. Fuck. I've been slowly saying goodbye to people for like 4 months now and this is the closest I've come to crying. I will miss you guys. Some of you I fucking hate and wont miss you, but some of you I will. Now I'm just rambling so I'm gonna cut it off.

Salut, drink to your freedom and enjoy it for me too,

1332427094.0	r8ef2	Seems I out drank myself.		87	14	34	"For those of you who didn't know, I've been at the Medical Center here all week in intensive care. The Doctor is planning on releasing me tomorrow. He said my blood levels are looking good but ""Improving towards being great doesn't mean off you go""

For those who still aren't sure what happened, I was experiencing extreme upper abdomen pain around 3am on Monday. The pain was so extreme I'd occasionally pass out, only to wake up groaning. Around 2pm I called my friend and asked him to take me to the ER. Around 3pm I was getting looked over. They gave me a shot of morphine, which did absolutely nothing to help the pain. I was then wheeled into the ultrasound booth so they could check out my organs.

It was the worst pain ever, the ultrasound wand shoving into my pancreas and all other tender/inflamed orgrans, without the help of any pain medication. I basically just laid on the table, grabbed the sides until my knuckles were white and cried for a while. After the life was taken out of me. Another friend showed up for a bit and we talked and she dropped things off for me, along with some advice I don't really recall. The owner of the Pub I frequent came by as well, but I was pretty much useless for the first few visits.
The following night was a constant battle of trying to find a med that worked enough to kill the pain. Eventually they resorted to Hydromorophone, Initially at 4mg every 4 hours, and after two hours, convinced a doctor to allow me to do it 4mg every 2 hours. I was pretty much useless during this time, and every time I woke up in my room I seemed to be in a different place. All I could do is push a button and ask for more medication.

Come Wednesday the pain had died down and I'd begun to be somewhat lucid. I'd tapered myself off the pain meds so I could realize what was going on. Doctor told me I could start on clear fluids (the day before) but I refused to start until wednesday. Had loads and loads of visitors that day (thanks everyone!). Later on in the day I acquired a very annoying roomate, and was thankfully moved into my own private room. Nice to have some peace and quiet now. Looking forward to eating some maybe even real food, getting this god damn IV out of me, removing my chest monitors and getting the fuck out of here.

Sorry for not letting everyone know sooner. Nobody really knew many details, myself included.

Additionally, I have been told in all seriousness that drinking again will result in the same problem, but far faster and far more serious. I plan on not drinking for a while, but I will be getting a second opinion.

The Doctor was good, aside from his repeatedly slamming me about drinking and when I had zero withdrawals, exactly like I told him would happen with me, he was shocked. Today I told him I was getting a bit moody and anxious and had trouble sleeping.

He said ""Oh, do you think that's the withdrawal?""

I said ""No, I think it's because over the past four days I've been stuck with needles every four hours, loaded up with meds that make my bowels come to a complete hault, woken up constantly by patients who just scream, machines beeping constantly, and having no idea when I'm going to leave. Not to blame either of you, but this is why I'm a little on edge.""

He laughed and said ""Sounds like you're back.""

 well,  I really need to go to the store and get him more food, but my stomach and intestines are failing on me so bad all of the sudden that being away from the toilet for even the 20 minutes that it would take to get more cat food is looking pretty impossible.  (good thing the liquor store is only a block away am I right?)

So this morning I just made him some scrambled eggs hoping that that would be enough for now.  Apparently it isn't, because he just gave me this look like I am the biggest piece of shit in the universe and then walked off. I haven't seen him since.  

I really hope he comes back soon because at this point that damn cat is pretty much my only reason to live.

First date: All the formalities, we eat the chinese restaurant, watch a movie, talking about our lifestyles and families, etc. We go back to my place for ""a drink"" (singular, we said). Ended up downing a fifth of Captain Morgan Black Cask between us. She spends the night, but I am a gentleman, and do not take advantage of extremely drunk women on the first date.

In the morning, she is amazed that I did not rape her. She is also amazed that I have already started into a fifth of Southern Comfort. It's probably 6am at this point, we both have to go to work. I was worried she would see this desperate attempt to fight off crippling withdrawals and run away screaming. To my surprise she was totally cool with it. Where have you been all my life?

1334796335.0	sgzvv	How to spot a non-CA [or how I learned to stop worrying and love the hooch].		85	9	55	"  I had a couple of minutes to kill.  I already risked my freedom (again) for the sake of another.  Oh fucking well I thought as I walked through the concrete jungle.  Usually when I am stranded in some god awful place the first thing I look for is the liquor store or bar within walking distance.  Luck was on my side today, a fully stocked bar with some Mexican beer on draft, amber or lager; I decided on the amber.  I ordered a few and the waiter talked me into ordering some food.  My stomach was rumbling and I thought I could go for a couple tacos.

  The meal was rather uneventful.  Off in the distance the bartender was chatting up a business woman and her bleach blonde cohort.  That’s when I noticed her.  

  Her: “What kind of flavored vodkas do you have?”  

  Bartender: “Oh you know the usual, this and that.”
  
  Her: “Hmm, well you know I’ll have “the whatever” flavor, ice and soda water.  It’s been *such* a stressful day this (one) alcoholic beverage has never looked so good!  I can’t believe I am having this drink right now, only one then off home.”

  I chuckled to myself as she ordered her flavored vodka with soda water.  I even considered buying her the one drink but I probably shouldn’t buy a drink for someone who thinks one drink is a lot.   Drink number three (for myself) was sitting rather well and I decided I would have a few more.  A few well tequila shots with a side of water, perfect.  I stumbled back to my destination feeling full of life, like if I were to do something right now people would take notice.  They didn’t and I went home and tried my hand at writing, again.

I was 22 and just out of college. Got out of a bad relationship and began drinking heavily daily to medicate myself as my life hadn't been going according to plan. I didn't graduate college with a lucrative job, or even a decent one at that. Fell into a crowd that enabled the shit out of me and never discouraged my growing addiction. Then I did the unthinkable, something I had always promised myself what I wouldn't do. I drove pretty damn drunk one night from a bar and totaled a car, gaining a DUI in the process and losing the respect of my family leading to 3 years of them bailing me out of the life I had created for myself. 

Sure I did the classes and the rehab and paid all the fines, but the worst part wasn't those. It was the unending shame of calling home and them asking if I was drinking again and how probation was going. Hearing the pain in my mom's voice almost nightly cut deep so the only solution was to get drunker and forget that I had done all of this. Told my brother shortly before his wedding what I had done and seeing that look in his eyes at his wedding while I was at the open bar was almost too much. Begging for rides from friends, sneaking out of work early to go to outpatient rehab and having a woman watch me pee into a cup to test me for drugs or alcohol weekly. My ex (the one from earlier in the story) was my ride from work after I took cabs in the wee hours of the morning and maxing out/taking out credit cards to pay for the transportation. I hid that I had the DUI by saying that my car was broken and I couldn't fix it. The ex and I fell back into old habits mostly through my own self-hatred and the need for ""positive attention"". This pattern continued on for months until I said ""Fuck it, I'll drive myself"". Boom. Driving on suspended and more lawyers fees/court appearances. 

I got lucky and only received a month and a half extra suspension on that and no jail time. Seriously, I lit a candle at church cause there was someone looking down on me that day. Another 2 years of INSANE insurance fees and again having mom call to check on my drinking. Currently digging my way out of thousands of dollars in credit card debt as well as paying my family back for everything that they have done for me is the goal so I can finally move on with my life and start anew is where I am at. If I go out, there is ALWAYS money for a cab or someone else is driving. My friends have gotten lectures/offers from me that if they go out and get drunk to call me for a ride or I will pay for a cab if I can't get behind a wheel. The laissez faire attitude I see from people that have not dealt with this or who do not drink as much as I do/did is mind boggling. The same goes for this sub. 

We all know the risks and worry about things like probation or possible jail time but it runs much deeper than that. We know that you can kill someone with a cavalier attitude of being behind the wheel after only having ""a couple drinks"". Yes, we may handle alcohol better but that doesn't matter to a breathalyzer. The real effects come after the jail time, probation, and fines are taken care of. The years of dealing with bills you've run up and not being able to move around freely. Knowing you let down the people who love you the most and the feeling of helplessness adds. I missed the funeral of someone I loved very much and who had raised me because I am now barred from Canada. Yes, a whole fucking country will not allow me to cross the border because one night I let vodka take the wheel. Anyone here thinking of driving after a couple, please reconsider. Anyone who isn't dependent to the point where driving to the liquor store before closing because you **KNOW** the morning will be filled with vomiting and shakes because you don't have a drink, please reconsider. The last thing I want to do is be preachy but with the number of posts I see asking for help, I think everyone needs to take a step back and not focus on the short term and look forward to your future. 

Thank you if you read this all.

Was not expecting what happened next. There I was, drunk as fuck, and I hear my name. I was asked to come stand in front of about 40 people and accept a Starbucks gift card because I was deemed 'volunteer of the year' for the county.

1357470236.0	162297	I had some kind of goddamn mental breakdown on the bus. Lady liquor saved me.	barney_barnes	92	20	8	"I drink every night, but I usually ramp it up on the Thursday night and keep myself pretty drunk Friday to Sunday. I'm not George Jones level drunk, but nonetheless I'm pretty susceptible to withdrawal symptoms. Maybe I'm just a big pussy. Anyways, that's the background to this story.

Last weekend, I didn't sleep Saturday night and stayed blotto through to late Sunday night. I wake up on Monday and the hangover/withdrawal sets in. I have the shaky hands and the paranoia and all the symptoms. But I have to get to work so I can't have any hair of the dog. I really want to call in sick, but I've done that so much I'm on the verge of being fired. So I decided to tough it out. Luckily, I don't have any diarrhea, which is a rare bonus.

So I get ready and I get on the bus. It's a 30 minute bus ride. I usually enjoy it, but on that day I start getting these sickening waves of anxiety. I start sweating. I swear the bus driver keeps looking at me in his rearview mirror. The sweat is gather on my forehead. I crack a window. It's below freezing outside, but the sweat won't stop.

I can feel the other people on the bus looking at me, and I think I catch snatches of them whispering about me. The bus seems like it's crawling along. I feel like I've been on it for years. I keep wiping my forehead. The waves of anxiety become waves of panic. When each one hits, I feel the overwhelming urge to just GET! OUT! of the bus immediately.

I keep swallowing. I'm worried that when I swallow, my throat will close up. My breathing feels shallow. I'm not getting enough air into my lungs. I have to stuff my hands between my knees cause they're shaking and I'm pretty sure people are noticing. I'm afraid the bus will pull over and they'll make me get off before my stop.

Finally, about 6 waves of panic later, I come to my stop. I'm worried I won't be able to walk right, but I can. The walking in the open air feels a lot better than being on the bus. I'm in the anonymous crowd of the city. This is better. This is better. No, wait. Another wave of panic rolls through me. Christ.

I walk towards my office. But, oh god, the office will be worse than the bus. Much worse. I get anxiety going to the office even on normal days. As I get closer, I realize the whole idea of going to the office is insane. I'll be sweating and shaking like madman.

I turn just before my office and head to the convenience store. I buy two little bottles of liquor, barely able to count my money. I go off to a little park and down half of one in a gulp. It's not working. The anxiety is still there. Oh god, I'm trapped inside an insane person's mind. Even my escape valve doesn't work. I down the rest of the bottle and crack the second.

A slight glow of calm starts to come over me, soothing the anxiety. Yes, it's working. I drink down the rest of the second and dump the bottles in a trashcan. Ah, Good. Good good. I feel better. I feel like I can go to work. But now I'm drunk again and I can't, so I go see a movie alone. Another fucking failure from me. Oh well."	t5_2s68b	True

My wife and I split a little over a month ago, when it happened I drowned myself in scotch and bourbon. It has been the worst time in my life, I spent the better part of two weeks getting hammered and begger her to take me back. We both had failings in our marriage. A week ago I decided to quit drinking (ive done it for a day before but that was it) I was tired of getting off work, getting wasted, calling and begging her to come back. 

Three days ago she basically told me to fuck off and never talk to her again, didn't drink. Yesterday I saw her and her new man I guess where I work (hospital) and had it out with them. She said basically well it had been a whole month did I really expect her to not move on? Yeah, a whole month you fucking bitch. But still after all that, I did not come home and drink. I am honestly feeling very accomplished, if I can resist drinking after all that, I feel like I can resist drinking for any reason. Life is still fucked and I hope that one day I can control myself with alcohol but part of me knows that will never happen, and I just need to bid it farewell. 

I sat in my car after drinking most of a fifth of scotch and a six pack of natty's with a knife to my wrists, in a parking lot, just drawing enough blood to convince myself to go all the way.

While I have a few of those people in my circle, none of them are remotely influential in getting me anywhere within their organizations. 

I wake up in the morning and during the hours where I put down an entire pot of coffee, I am sending out CV's. With each cover letter I create, I look at my skills, my training, my accomplishments, and I think ""Goddamn, I am good."" 

I'm riding high, proud of what I've achieved throughout my career and I give myself a self-satisfied wink that I still have enough discipline to hold off on drinking for a couple more hours - just one more application. Just one more and then you can reward yourself.

Today I spotted a job that I am HELLA qualifed for and actually got excited about applying for as I am certain I would enjoy it. I submitted my application and received a confirmation back thanking me for applying, along with a little blurb that I am the 228th person to submit an application for this position.

Two hundred and twenty eight other people who are just as fucked as I am. Take half of that and give them more education than I have. Take another half of that who haven't been unemployed for a scary amount of time and as such are considered ""more employable."" Take half of that and fuck it. So I bid farewell to hope and anticipation and pride and instead will drink to distract myself from the fear and doubt and the disappointment. Goddammit.

My gf is currently supporting me, but I feel like a piece of shit when she pays the bills and for food and for anything we ever do outside of the apartment.  The only thing I buy myself is booze.  I can't continue that for much longer due to lack of funds.  I've been turned down by pizza hut, papa johns, radio shack, kroger, publix, UPS, and I'm sure there's more, but I'm buzzing.

I start a new job in ten days. Hoping that will be enough time to get acclimated to sobriety after this 7-year run of hitting it hard every single day, but, more likely, I fear that ten days from now I'm going to still be in bad shape. We shall see.

I've been unemployed and living on mom's couch for the last two fucking years. One month ago I got a call for an interview 80 miles and a ferry ride away from here. Had to get my 76 year old mother to drive me there. She doesn't drive so well outside of the quiet little town she lives in and it was hard on her. Almost got t-boned and rear-ended several times because she drives so slow, but, we made it.

10 days later they offered me the job, pending a thorough background check which I was certain would doom me, so, I didn't hold out hope. Got the good news yesterday. I promised myself I'd quit drinking if I got the job (mainly because I really didn't think I'd get it). 

The company has a stellar rep in the industry and treats its' employees very well. The job is easy as fuck, comes with a **free** 2-bedroom apartment, pays a very decent salary, I am my own boss and only answer to someone 800 miles away. I get medical, dental, vision, life-insurance and a **matching** 403b. The last time I did this kind of work, I had over 250 units (I'm a HUD 202 Senior Living Manager btw) and a lazy, incompetent maintenance man. This property only has 38 units, including mine, the property is in excellent condition and the maintenance man is one of those ""proud as fuck about my work"" guys. 

My mom is going to sell me her loaded 2005 Toyota Camry and front me the money for an ignition-interlock and SR-22 insurance. Since I'll have close to zero living expenses, I'll be able to pay the goddamn court (finally), and pay mom for the car in record time. If all goes well I can climb out of this shithole mindset I've had and actually make some friends or possibly even get laid for the first time in nearly four years. I'm looking forward to things like: proper hygiene, eating food, sleeping, and, god-help-me, not feeling like shit and having the shakes all the time.

Since all I own is a few dozen button-down shirts, 2 pairs of dockers, one pair of jeans and two pairs of shoes (I trusted the wrong guy to ship my belongings when I moved from Alaska to Washington) and literally nothing else, the two-bedroom apartment will be completely empty. Not even a bed. I am actually looking forward to re-building my material life by making deliberate and thoughtful purchases instead of just buying dumb shit all the time and filling a house with it like my wife and I did in Alaska. 

If you've read this far, thanks for that. I literally have no one else I can share this with. The last four years have been complete and utter hell for me and I'm determined not to fuck this opportunity up. Wish me luck and I'll still be around, lurking and laughing at and crying for all the unique and wonderful characters here. Cheers!

Here are some blacked out, I don't remember writing them excerpts:

Foreigner is playing on the radio.  It brings back memories of going to work parties with my dad and watching all his coworkers get fucked up on Budweiser and Marlboro reds.  It harkens back to a time when adults could still be adults, kids or no kids, and there were no repercussions.  Now it’s all about worrying about scarring the little ones.  Something bad happened between then and now.  

As a child growing up around drunks, I recall no negative memories.  They had a good time with each other, and were to a man, super affectionate to me.

My grandfather used to drink beer all day, every day.  At work.  Grandma didn’t particularly like this, so he kept a stash in a beer fridge on the porch of a neighbor.  He built a bicycle with a basket on the handle bars and gave it to me.  Then he’d say, “Go on a mercy mission for me,” which meant I was to ride to the neighbor’s house, retrieve a beer, put it in the basket, and bring it to him.

Grandpa was never ashamed to drink around me, but in exchange, he took me everywhere and gave no fucks what people thought about it.  We’d ride bikes in the rain, making sure to splash every puddle, to the bar, where he taught me to shoot pool when I was 6.

Early Madonna on the radio.  Getting sexed up on chat.  Horny, but past the point of even getting myself off.  Good times.  Good times.

I’m giving music recommendations.  I’m drunk.  I hope they like it.

At this point, I’m entering the rabbit hole.  I can no longer feel.  This is the place I want to be.  I don’t hurt here.  Phil Collins is playing.  I remember being 13, fishing, seeing the whale in the delta.  Glen Frey was popular then.   My grandma was alive.  I was a  happy adolescent.  She died, and I died with her.  Ever since, I’ve struggled.  People taking from me.  Car dealers.  My wife.  

I just died in your arms tonight.  It brings memories of parking my grandmother’s car shortly before she died.  She was a skeleton.  Jaundiced.  My mother wouldn’t let me kiss he for fear the cancer was contagious.  I didn’t get to go to her funeral.  The dogs lay on her grave.  I hate my parents for not letting me go to the funeral.

The steel gray sky meant good striper fishing.  My grandpa, my uncle.  They drank so much I had to drive the boat home.  But I loved it. I had responsibilitly,and we caught fish.  God I miss those days.  I caught a 15-pound striper then. It did a 360 around the boat and took 30 minutes to land.  My grandpa cursed at me the whole time.  He hit me with the metal button on his cap.  But I brought that fucker in, and I have a picture with me thrusting my arm in the air to prove it.  

There was a jogging trail by my house.  I used to go running on it with my sister.  I remember 1986.  She told me about the end credits to Ferris Bueller’s day off.  The song.  She liked it.  She comforted me, in that my dad beating me wasn’t my fault.

Heartburn.  It hits.  Tears for Fears playing.  I remember being a hacker in the 80s.  _____ _____ paid me a visit.  My dad had no idea why this Russian dude was coming to my house.  We’d conjoined in a software pirating venture, and as far as my dad knew, that meant I was smart.

Huey Lewis.  This brings memories of my waterskiing days.  The women.  In their mid-30s.  In bikinis.  Stressed over stretch marks.  Me trying to control the boner.

It is called ""When It Was Fun"""	lifeishowitis	78	4	19	"I hadn't written a poem in a while, or any of my fiction, obviously being an alcoholic and all I fancy myself a writer. Anywho, people seem to be sharing a lot so I thought I'd give it a try, too.

I, too, remember when it used to be fun

Before false arms flailing 

grasping for the wardrobe, knowing

one was left, you remember

but you were black out drunk

The night your friends told you about

where they took you swimming because, hey

they had seen you worse off


I, too, remember when it used to be fun

when I'd go shot for shot with the boys

ordering Dewar's, straight up

and they'd laugh, and I'd win

and wear it like a badge


Still do sometimes

if you can't stand what you see, 

take your glasses off.


I, too, remember when it used to be fun

before the ugliness shined through

and I'd go to work, and I could tie my shoes

I was shaking from birth

but its become more of a choice

I don't get any pills for it.

I no longer drink with the boys.


 

For now, I drink me under the table.

Now, the bottle turned gun.

I, too, remember when it used to be fun.

I ask the guy if they're just throwing this shit away, and he says no, we sell it for $5 a box. I ask him what that means and he tells me anything that fits in the box is $5. I'm not a math whiz, but I do a couple quick calculations in my head and find out that this is one goddamn hell of a deal, so I grab a box and load it up with 12 40oz bottles of Hurricane and Steel Reserve.

Now, I'm hungover as fuck, see still quite intoxicated, and she says to me ""Hey whiskeynwaitresses can I have a word?""  Now this bitch is always on me about something, smoking to close to the building, flicking cig butts in the street (note there is no smoker caddy or coffee can or anything) etc etc.  So I sigh and think to myself ""the fuck could it be now"" and offer a weak nod of my compliance.  And this twat has the gall to say to me ""I think we need to discuss your drinking.""  ""My drinking?"" I say incredulously, ""Why would WE discuss MY drinking.  Did I break something?  Were there noise complaints?""  ""Oh no"" she says ""but I have noticed you coming in some mornings quite obviously hungover and my husband said he came to knock on your door the other day and when you answered you smelled of whiskey and it was around 5 pm.""

Who does this bitch think she is?  My sponsor?  I'm 25, never late with rent, have done literally 0 damage to my place (which they are aware of because they had to come in to snake the drain in the bathroom a week or two back) and as I last recall being drunk in and of itself is not a crime.  But back to the story.

So I say ""yeah well to be honest I don't see how its any of your business, me being of legal drinking age and by your own admission not disturbing other tenants or causing damage to the building."" trying my best to keep the growing anger out of my voice.

To which she responds ""when you signed the lease you were told there were no drugs or drug abuse allowed on premises and alcohol is a drug, even if its legal.""

At this point I am beside myself, I'm sweating buckets of Jameson, have a pounding headache and just want to get into my apartment so I can have a beer and take the edge off and then begin my daily battle to hydrate so I can get hammered again that night.

""Yes, I do remember you mentioning that when I signed my lease but who says I'm abusing alcohol, you?  I don't see why you get to be judge and jury here.  Not to mention you said ""on the premises"" and based on the fact that you see me COME HOME ""looking hungover"" that suggests that even if I WERE abusing alcohol, which I'm not, I'm not doing it ON the premises.""  At this point she just sighs and asks me to ""think about what she said."" whatever the fuck that means.

* The problems you drank to forget are still going to be around when you sober up. I can't even begin to fathom the amount of debt I have after ignoring mounting medical and misc bills for the last 4 years.

* Some of your friends only ""like"" you because you are someone to drink with. These people suck and I can say wholeheartedly none of my friends on this sub fall into that category so... thanks!

* You are a different person when drinking. Notice I say ""when drinking"" and not ""when drunk"" because I'm not referring to the stupid and insensitive shit we all do when well-sauced but rather the personality that drinking regularly cultivates. I'm trying to deal with understanding the ""new"" me as I find myself reacting differently to many things now that I'm sober.

* Your body does not recuperate quickly. I still have shaking hands randomly after 4 weeks, apparently this is common. My insides still hurt randomly. Keep taking your alchy vitamin regiments and eat right/sleep right as much as possible if you are sobering up for any period of time.

* ""You don't know where the line is 'til you've crossed it"" -HST
The good doctor's words imply something else to me in this setting. Once you cross that line into full-fledged physical dependance to the point of being no where *near* functioning, it's pretty much impossible to go back to drinking ""normally"". I hate to say it but I've never had any luck with it, if any of you figure it out let me know.

I'm gonna cut this off before I start rambling more. I have shit to do this afternoon. Above all else, wanted to say I love you r/CA! Thanks for your support (you know who you are) and have a drink for me!

The days he doesn't drink, he is so fucked up on pills that he slurs his speech and his eye don't open. I have to ditch him when I want to go out because he looks embarrassing. But, when I get concerned about him losing his job, and driving he get upset. He swears he doesn't take over his prescribed amount, and he never mixes them. According to him he didn't even take his prescription at all this week. He doesn't know why he cant focus at work,  why he throws up most mornings, or why people tell him he has been slurring. His boss sent him home today because he was throwing up. He is a mechanical engineer who can't finish a project. He thinks he has the flu all the time and has been to the hospital because of his ""weak immune system"" twice in 3 month. He told me he has gone to bed by 11 every night this week... I sat out in the living room drinking, while watching him on the other couch mumble nonsense to his girlfriend until 2am. He wrecked his car on the way into work a few month back. He finished paying off his brand 2010 Camaro off 2 weeks ago, the next week he went and got himself a new Ford Raptor truck and put himself 35k back in the whole. The next morning he woke me up asking me where his keys were while holding the raptor keys. He forgot he had bought it. He is cool when he isn't on his pills, but nothing ever his fault, its always someone else. And he throws me under the bus to everyone he knows so the focus is on me, not him. I am an alcoholic, I'm still not tired of it, and I am having fun. I don't crash cars and spend tens of thousands while blacked out. Fuck off.

I have avoided Bar A from that post for the past month, hoping that particular bartender would quit, be fired, or die so I could go back in.

Last night I walked down to Bar B to see if I had drunkenly left my jacket there the other night (indeed I had). I passed a table where some bearded German guy who worked there was sitting. I had met him the other night and grilled him about Kraftwerk and Einsturzende Neubauten and was probably pretty annoying.

He was sitting with some other dude and I joined them for a beer. Turns out the other dude is the owner of Bar A. First I told him how much I liked his place, and then explained how I'd been blacklisted over a misunderstanding. The guy was really cool and said to forget about it and just go there again.

So now I can go back to Bar A, and if the douchebag bartender gives me a hard time, I can say, ""Your fuckin' boss said it's cool.""

I'm a walking cliche. I have PTSD and drink the nerves away. 
It started because I couldn't afford bulk weed anymore, so fuck yeah cheap tequila!

I still take 2 kinds of anxiety meds on top of it. Anxiolotic and benzo on top of shots. Seems like I'm finally outgoing and awesome now.

I used to get drunk once in awhile and I never knew if I'd be mad-drunk, happy-drunk, or sad-drunk.

Now that I started drinking regularly ALWAYS happy drunk.

I've been going out, talking to strangers, it helps my anxiety a lot.

I went to the zoo, I made a random conversation with a Turkish immigrant and it's so much easier to talk to people about nothing than force myself to say hi all clammed up and awkward and off-putting.

I take shots every day, and I've never been happier or more social.

My life has never been more normal or happy or full of adventure and friendly chats with complete strangers. It's helped my PTSD a lot putting me out in new situations and feeling great talking to people. 
I'm less off-putting as a drunk. I hope it helps my anxiety in the long run with so many random positive experiences with people since I've been drunk every day.

I love you so much.

Drink Responsibly: Well fuck, all of us know what that means.

Stay hydrated: Alcohol dehydrates you, if you are in one of the Western states like my self, drink plenty of water while you are having a BBQ or going to parades.

Drink at home: No one wants to go out on a holiday, it is novice nite, stay indoors with your pets and do what you do best.

It has been a bit over a year since I got laid off from  my  previous job, almost immediately I stopped being a functioning alcoholic, and became a raging alcoholic. It took a toll in my family, almost lost my wife, kids and cat. But I got my shit together.

I got an awesome new job, with excellent benefits and guess what fuckers, P.T.O. I haven't had PTO in a while but it has been years since I have taken a full week off work. So I'm enjoining our Independence day for a week.

I am not really any of that shit, I drink because I really actually do love it, even the bad bits in the morning, I trudge through and feel a sense of accomplishment for have soldiered right past it.

I drink because I like to have fun with my friends and I actually enjoy bars and talking with people. I like how booze makes people happy and chatty, I like how it makes girls feel sexy and how it makes guys feel like they could take on anything. I like that there is a seemingly endless variety of boozes to try and that mixing booze is considered a near art form the world round, to the point where there are bar-tending schools.

I like that there are wine tastings, scotch tastings, sake tastings and beer tastings. I like beer in the can, in the bottle out of a tap. I like wine out of a spacebag in cardboard, out of a bottle or mixed with orange juice.

I love booze and I love booze culture.

I celebrate it.

I am probably a little crippled from my pure and unadulterated love of drinking which is why I am here, but that is just another aspect of my love of drinking.

One afternoon I awoke naked in my hotel bed. (Lovely feeling, having those dirty sheets pressed up against me.) I checked the sheets and the clothes I was wearing, but they were all dry. My laptop was on the floor next to me, and something felt out of place. I picked it up, hit the button, but it was dead, and the screen was all cracked to shit. No idea why. No memory whatsoever of anything past about halfway through the bottle. I think I was on chat. I hope I wasn't naked on chat. I wish I hadn't done whatever I did. 

Not having a computer cut me off from all of my friends, and all of my entertainment. I spent an entire day scanning the same basic cable channels on TV. I felt depressed, and I didn't go to work. 

I had some friends promise to have a room ready for me to rent about the time my money would be running out. They backed out. I felt scared. I felt more depressed. I stopped going to work altogether. You can guess how that turned out. I ran out of money. I drank up all the money.

I was outdoors for a few nights. My folks agreed to let me back under their roof for a few nights while I got my affairs in order. By that I mean while I sell everything. That's what I'm doing, I'm selling everything except for a few clothes, packing up my entire life into my car and leaving town. I'm heading for Austin, not because I really want to be there, but because I think my car might make it.

I think I have two more days worth of work selling and prepping, then I'm gone. I'm fucking terrified. I haven't drank in four days, and I haven't slept in three nights. Even inside my mind races the night away looking for some important detail I'm overlooking. But as scared as I am, I am so fucking excited. I'm going to be free. Fucking free. I have no job lined up, and no place to stay, but Goddamn it I'm going to be free. For the first time my life feels wide open. I've wanted a change like this for a while, I've driven myself to this point because deep down I know I would never have the guts to do it otherwise.

I'll be checking in tomorrow and maybe Wednesday, and as often as possible after that. Any advice would be much appreciated.

1303137739.0	gss2d	Unbelievable treatment of a fellow boozebag.	Gumburcules	79	12	24	"So Saturday was a friend's birthday, and we all went out to celebrate.  We went to a dance club type place.  Definitely not my scene, but I'm not the kind of person to say no to a girl on her birthday.  We drink, we dance, we have a good time.  One of my friends gets a drink bought for her by some guy.

Fast forward an hour or so, my friend asks my girlfriend to go outside with her because she isn't feeling well.  While trying to sit down on the curb, she falls over and doesn't get up.  Now this girl is a champion drinker.  She can put them down with the best of em, and she only had 4 or 5 drinks at this point, so my girlfriend got very worried.  All of a sudden she starts having a seizure.  My girlfriend calls 911, and about a half hour later an ambulance shows up.

Now this is in a major city, and we are only about 5 minutes away from a large, well respected hospital, so already it is getting off to an ominous start.  The EMTs put her on the gurney, and the whole time are laughing at her, saying they can't believe anyone would let themselves get this drunk, and that she should be ashamed of herself.  My girlfriend explains that she only had a few drinks and has a history of seizures, and also that a guy she didn't know had given her a drink.  They blew my girlfriend off, told her that she wasn't having a seizure, and at first refused to even call the situation in to the hospital/dispatch.

At that point a police car pulled up, and my girlfriend explained to the cop the situation, and the cop ordered the EMTs to take her to the hospital for treatment and to have a tox screen.  The cop gave my girlfriend his card and told her to call him if the tox screen tested positive for roofies.  

They arrive at the hospital and the doctor is just as disrespectful as the EMTs.  He makes the same disparaging comments as the EMTs, and tells my girlfriend she is ""irresponsible and stupid"" for letting her get that drunk.  My girlfriend tells him that she and the police suspect my friend was roofied, and that the cop had requested a tox screen.  He gave her some seizure meds, but that was the only thing he did that could even remotely be considered medical care.  

They keep her overnight for observation, and discharge her in the morning.  My friends parents had arrived by this point, and they noticed that the tox screen results weren't in the discharge papers.  They ask about them, and the doctor says that he didn't give her one, ""because we get girls who can't drink responsibly all the time, and it would be a waste of resources to screen all of them."" 

I know society in general tends to look down upon us imbibers, but I assumed the medical profession would at least show a modicum of professional courtesy.  My girlfriend is calling the police officer today to explain the situation, and I am drafting a formal letter of complaint to the hospital.  Hopefully something will come from it, but I am not terribly hopeful.

Sorry to be a downer this early in the morning, but I wanted to share and possibly elicit some sympathy from my fellow boozehounds.    "	t5_2s68b	True

I probably passed out at 7 pm.  This is fine.  This happens.  But I woke up with a start and saw the clock said 11:45.  I happen to need to be at work at 11, so I jumped up and got ready, like shower, uniform, everything,  I ran outside to the pitch dark night and only then realized that I didn't have to be at work for another 10 hours. It was 11:45 pm  Victory, I guess?  At least alcohol sales don't stop until 2, so I'm alright...  It's bizarre what this lifestyle makes me consider a victory.	t5_2s68b	True
1363003285.0	1a2sw6	Train Ride	MasterAndMargarita	72	5	23	"So I took a night train from Moscow to St. Petersburg for the weekend for an exploratory adventure. I went with 2 friends (1 a CA, the other a new friend who goes to Yale and doesn't drink much) and our train didn't leave until Thursday night/Friday morning (international women's day) but I started drinking as soon as I got out of school (4pm). After drinking many many liters of beer in various restaurants on the way to the train station I drunkenly find our train, car, and spot (I know Russian the best of us, but am the most hammered). Once safely in our spot, my CA friend and I go looking for the restaurant car to get booze, but quickly find out that it is closed. Undeterred I pulled out my secret water bottle full of vodka and we begin pounding this on the train while conversing amiably with a Russian woman in the same car. 

Skip to the next morning: I wake up with a horrible pain in my left leg a cut on my foot, and find myself on the bottom bunk (I had the top bunk originally) and no memory of any happenings. Apparently my CA friend and I turned in at some point and I managed to fall off the top bunk, even though it has a guard rail, didn't wake up. I just rolled around on the floor of this Russian train until a helpful Russian slapped me around until I woke up enough to be helped onto the lower bunk.

1347149004.0	zkunk	I've made a huge mistake	tempestbloke	73	6	21	"I'm the happiest drunk you'll ever meet. Sincerely, I am. But every once in a great while something clicks over in my head, something bad, and I never remember what happened. But its always life altering, for the worse. 

Yesterday I tried to save my friend and roommate from losing his car. It got towed for expired tags, and we went mad trying to get it out of the towyard. We ran out of money, everything we both had, trying to get it out, but it's lost now, they charge by the day, a shitton.

We get home and its consolation time, I say he can ride my motorcycle until he gets a job. He never drinks with me, but we pal around and have a great time when I'm sloshed, always have. I pick up spiced rum for me, cookie dough vodka for him, mixed with mountain dew. He's happy, and I'm glad cause I thought he'd be depressed for days. And that's the last thing I remember. 

Wake up this morning in a self made pile of disgust. Roommate's gone. Phone's battered to bits. Shit everywhere. Blood on my knuckles. He wouldn't hurt a fly, and I had a violent upbringing, and a violent past. Flashes of memory, flickering in and out of my conciousness. I recall he admitted he had thought about suicide, and I got pissed as fuck. But that was earlier, and I told him I'd lost too many friends already.

Shit. This hasn't happened in years, I'm always in control, nothing shakes me, how did this happen, what did I say, is he okay, how to I get a hold of him, is he coming back ever, I have most of his stuff, he never pays rent, he might have gone back to his ex wife. A stream of conciousness thunders through my head all at once, like a goddamn train I can't stop. 

I take a shot to steady my nerves, and light up. It helps, a little. The later and later the day gets, the less and less chance he's ever coming back. He's one of the best men I've ever met, an if I beat him in a confused rage out of a loss of control, I could never forgive myself. Last time this happened, I dried out. Went to AA. Not religious. Only made it 9 months before I went back to the bottle, hard. Lost my girl to it. It was the drink or her. I wish the decision had been harder, I really do.

Now as the sun goes down over the trees, I recline in my chair, my head in my hands, just waiting, begging the empty house, the walls themselves to make him come back, to explain, to let me apologize. I feel like a domestic abuser, like I should be thrown in jail, if only I could remember. 

Last bare memory is him cowering against the doghouse, his face screwed up in pain. He can't understand.

1340639173.0	vkqro	I was an underaged dj in a gay bar for a year. this is my story	throwawaymybooze	87	19	17	"NOTE: I am supposed to go to the dentist in two hours and I don't fucking want to, so this is to take my mind off of it. Plus it came up in another thread and I was encouraged to write about my experience.
------------------------------

I'm 33 year old woman now (or will be in a week, im 32 now) and when I was 18-20 I DJ'd in a gay bar in a redneck town in central California. 

I got the job through my day job. Originally they'd hired us as a media company to promote their bar and I was doing it as ""media company celebrity."" Whatever. Dude couldn't pay his advertising bill but he liked me so he kept me on and paid me in cash. 3 nights a week I would get in my shitty Chevy Cavalier and go to Sonic and get the biggest vanilla dr pepper they sold and go to work. 

I make no illusions to be Paul Oakenfold, I was a CD DJ in the time before Serato. My gear consisted of a 1000 cd wallet filled with burned shit, a flash light and the clubs duel decks and mixing board. I'd get there at 6 when the bar opened, pop an hour long mix in and wait. I got to sit at the bar alot and at first they were stealthy about giving me a drink here or there but eventually even though I wasn't CA status or drinking to get drunk they just put a bottle of vodka under my cd tables in the booth knowing I'd bring in my huge soda from the drive thru.

We were a misfit gay bar. One that played a lot of punk and 90s (duh it was the 90s) electro bullshit. Prodigy was big. So was Cake, Lo Fidelity All Stars and for some reason a lot of numetal was requested there. Sometimes we'd have bands come in and I ran stage for them. One band made the mistake of calling my bartender a cunt and I came out of the booth over the mic and I came out of the booth and slapped him across the face to a crowd of very stunned gay boys who all applauded me.

I'm not a fag hag. I just like people of all kinds. I liked these people. After the bar would close the old queen that ran the place would do lines, fondle boys and pay me in cash. Sometimes if he knew I was going off to a party especially with one of the bands he had paid badly he'd give me a six pack or a bottle to take as long as I would keep my ID badge on when I walked in. They were little laminated lanyards like a backstage pass so normally my idiot ass would forget I had it anyway, but he made my friends happy.

Lowlights included: walking in a blow job happening in my booth before we opened. good job owner man.  going to a party and having the host start smoking crack and then telling me it was something herbal (i left, what the fuck?) getting face raped by a really unattractive lesbian who I worked with. Slapping a man, punching another man. Having a gay dude fall for me and that's pretty much why I quit. Guy was my best friend. We drank a little and he got straight about it and then followed me around for a few days. about the time i decided I might like him that way too he told me in front of his friends that he had just been horny and to stop being such a fag hag. In the back of my mind I wanted to whip out my phone/email and show these cunts how many times he'd done this or that but I let him be. I left after a bad night moneywise, took my gear, my vodka and my dignity and never worked there again.

About 3 months later I heard they were closing because my coke head boss couldn't afford to keep the lights on at this point, a flashy gay club with huge dance floors just opened up and I got called to work there but I turned it down. I went into my old place for a night and an underaged drink with one of my girlfriends and lemme tell you it felt good knowing I'd left before shit got like it was. Place was practically a bath house and definitely a drug den.

IMO, if any of these apply to you, please kindly GTFO and let us boozebags drink in peace:

* If your hands don't start shaking because you haven't had a drink by 3pm (if not earlier), or if your hands don't start shaking when you finally go and buy booze, you might not be a crippled alcoholic. 

* If the number of days you've spent sober in the last month takes more than one shaky hand to count, you might not be a crippled alcoholic. 

* If you don't wake up hungover often enough to be surprised when you don't, you might not be a crippled alcoholic. 

* If you haven't precisely determined the number of airplane shooters it takes to get through a shift at work adequately without drawing attention to yourself, you might not be a crippled alcoholic. 

* If you don't have a barely-controlled level of self-loathing over your drinking habit, you might not be a crippled alcoholic. 

* If you don't have to seriously *force* yourself to *not buy booze*, you're *definitely* not a crippled alcoholic.

* I remember the dinner. I might have said something embarrassing but nothing that crossed a line.

* I remember starting sex. Some oral and... that's where I'm out of memories.

I sit down, there is a trivia night going on.  The team sitting next to me needs help and ask me for some answers.  I end up joining them.  Turns out they are all video game developers, and I am now drinking beer with a man who designed the levels for Quake and Call of Duty.  

Flash forward an hour or so.  We are drinking shots.  They are drinking pansy ass fruity shots.  Sex on the beach, red headed sluts, etc.  I tell them it's time to man up and drink something real.  End up making up my own concoction of Jameson, Powers and Bushmills.  Basically an Irish 3 wise men.  Bartender tells me that is the most ridiculous shot anyone has ever taken, I get it put on the menu named after me.  

A few drinks later, one of the people I'm drinking with challenges me to a drink-off.  I put him away handily, he stands in awe of my chugging prowess.  He says: ""wow man, you should challenge [some South African guy over there] he is like the bar champion at speed drinking.  

Long story short, this asshole brushes me off, tells me he won't drink unless I complete some 7-chambers style bullshit where I have to beat the 2nd, 3rd 4th place people before I can drink against him.  I beat them all, shame the guy in front of his bar, and find out the bar has a ""winners drink free"" rule.

I was BUSY taking care of YOUR customers, sir.  Sorry you have NO IDEA how to run a food service business.  You treat your customers like shit.  You treat your employees the same way.  Sorry about YOUR bad day.  FIVE other customers walked out last night, all feeling the same way as me,  wronged.  Good luck with your business.  You are a crude, highly inappropriate human being,  No one should have to bite their tongue as much as I've had to in my short time of knowing you.  I needed that job, I did well, my coworkers and customers all appreciated me.  You, on the other hand, treated me HIGHLY inappropriately.  Constantly.  I am a human being, one that worked unrealistic almost 12 hour shifts for you on Wednesdays for almost no reason at all, given you don't have enough lunch clientele to require a second Dawn.  You're a mess, sir,  One I will no longer put up with.

So, you like your girls like you like your scotch, huh?  Eighteen years old you said.

Congrats on treating your employees like shit.

I did the minimum 3 months thanks to my excellent bullshitting and not-so-bright counselor. I didn't even have to do a UA because my counselor said it would be ""a waste of time and money.""

Here's how I did it: 1) **Told the truth as much as possible.** Only lie was that I quit drinking the day after the DUI, giving me over a year of ""sobriety."" 

2) **Showed progress.** When I came in I embellished my situation to appear that I was struggling with staying sober, had low self esteem and was very depressed. Each week all of these things got a little bit better and I made sure my counselor noticed it.

3) **Talked the talk.** I had 5 years sober once and was very involved with AA/NA (I got married at an NA convention for krisstsake) so I exploited my knowledge of recovery and spoke and acted just the same as a person ""active in their recovery.""

5) **Showed-up every week, participated in group and did my fucking homework.** There were/are guys in our group who have been there over 9 months who missed sessions and frequently ""forgot"" their homework. Now who's laughing?

So, the jist of it was that I had a plan going in and stuck to it. Since I've been in and out of this shit my entire life I got to put all that experience to use.

I like reading about everyone els'es shit lives when im hungover because it makes me feel better.  If you want you can read this but you dont have to because I'm going to ramble.  because it makes me feel better. 


I am jealous of my sister.  She \works her jobthing from noon to 5pm everyday make just enough money to pay for her studio apartment, phone bill, and the cheapest vodka or whiskey they sell in plastic half gallons.  She gets drunk all alone in her apartment every single night.  She never talks to anyone except when we communicate nightly via drunken texts.  In the morning hse is always horrified of the 46 texts she sent me at 4am but I laugh because really its hysterical.  We mostly just mock the rest of our family and how the latent alcohol gene must be in all of them too, and one day its really gonna fuck them all over.  Not us though, we're pros.  She's been hospitalized twice in the past 3 months for booze, once because she got blacked out drunk and thought a walk would be good, and ended up passed out on train tracks.  Cops found her and called it a suicide attempt which really pissed her off.  Also they ripped her favorite hoodie during her revival process and she was pissed as fuck about that too.  Now she doesn't go outside anymore. 


For my birthday she took me to see Doug Stanhope and because I was poorer than her she bought me 6 whiskey ginger ales that night.  She ordered them all at once becauyse the line to the bar was riciculous and the bartender just assumed she was ordering for her whole group.  It was magical. 


I dont think she's ever been hungover.  She absolutely hates puking because she thinks its a waste of alcohol.  She will sit there green in the face clenching her mouth shut trying to fight the urge.  Usually she wins but once she puked all over the back of my car.  I was taking her into the wild for camping and she found the bag in the backseat with all the booze in it.  After she puked I pulled over and she stumbled out of the car and fell into a ditch.  It was full of cow bones.  I discovered the freshly purchased 5th of tequila was over half gone, turned into car vomit.  she'd been drinking it warm, straight, without a chaser the whole drive.  hOw did I not notice that?? she lost one of her shoes in the ditch but we carried on.  She went camping the whole weekend in 1 shoe.  ruined her favorite socks that weekend.  She'd never gone camping before, or since and she fucking hated every minute of it.  She was in the same graduating class as Kevin Federline's little brother.  Britney Spears came to the goddamn graduation, which neither of us attended, because we were getting drunk at Caleb's gravesite, the kid who hung himself on the baseketball hoop in their gym at school.  Neither of us had ever talked to Caleb before but he soprta became our unofficial hero after the nerve to do such a thing.  Shocked the fuck out of so many people.  We used to drink at Caleb's gravesite a lot.  haven't in years.  Probably because she refuses to leave her apartment now, except for the liquor store or work, both of which are less than a block from her dwelling.  I suggested she should get out more, but she pointed out that it just ends badly, so instead she does her all time favorite thing in life and every night drinks and drinks until she's blacked out, then she watches Dawson's Creek.

Please note, I only have personal experience with this topic. I am *not* a doctor, and this is *not* medical advice. These are just my own thoughts based on what has worked for me, and on what I've read. It is important to me that this part is clearly understood.

To reiterate: this is **not medical advice**. Please, if you vomit blood, try to see a doctor.

---

But, okay, so you've vomited blood, and you've haven't yet seen a doctor.

There are a few things that need to be addressed first.

* 1) What colour is the blood? Is it typical [blood red](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematemesis)? Or, is it dark or does it even have the consistency of [coffee grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_ground_vomiting)?

If it is the latter, you need to **go to hospital immediately**. The blood is this way because the iron within it has mixed with the acid of your stomach, which usually indicates a much more severe cause/source.

* 2) How long has this been going on for? Have you developed any other physical symptoms? If so, are any of these unfamiliar to you?

If it's been going on for a long time and/or you have other symptoms alongside (particularly unusual ones), you are again best advised to see a doctor immediately. The same goes if the volume of blood is plentiful (it's hard to judge volumes of blood, I know, but try to use your best judgement).

* 3) Are you also shitting [tarry blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melena)? If so, again you should see a doctor.

* 4) If the blood is typical blood red, you should check to see if you can rule out other sources. Could you have scratched the back of your throat? Have you recently had a nosebleed? Are your gums bleeding? Have you been coughing blood too? These kind of things need to be paid attention to, and if present then they might be the cause (and thus ruling out anything too serious, apart from that coughing blood part - see a doctor).

---

Okay, so you've vomited blood, it definitely came *with* the vomit, and it's of that typical blood red shade.

To put your mind *somewhat* at ease, it's most likely coming from:

* erosion and/or inflammation and/or strain

of your

* stomach and/or oesophagus

caused by too much

* alcohol and/or [NSAIDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAIDs#Classification) and/or vomiting.

If you vomit a lot (like, 20% of the times you drink), or you take a lot NSAIDs ([Ibuprofen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen#Interactions) (Advil/Nurofen/[etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ibuprofen_brand_names)); [Aspirin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin#Gastrointestinal); [Naproxen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen#Risks_and_adverse_effects); [Dicofenac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac#Gastrointestinal) (Voltarol/Voltaren/[etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diclofenac#Trade_names)); etc), or you drink a lot… or any combination of these… you are putting your [GI tract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract) under serious strain. These factors, especially when aggravated by other habits (e.g. your diet), can lead to the vomiting of blood.

---

Common [causes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting_blood#Causes) of CAs vomiting blood, under the above circumstances, are:

* [Tears in the oesophagus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallory-Weiss_syndrome)

* Erosion of the stomach and/or oesophagus

* [Acute Gastritis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastritis#Acute)

Other (more major) causes might be:

* [Peptic ulcer(s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_ulcer#Classification)

These are serious, and can develop if earlier symptoms/issues (such as gastritis) are ignored.

Whilst a lot of these [symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_ulcer#Signs_and_symptoms) can (and do) result from the aforementioned more common and/or minor causes of vomiting blood (such as gastritis), these are symptoms that you should be watching out for regarding ulcers, particularly in the context of their getting worse:

-- Stomach pain

-- Bloating

-- Nausea

-- Frequent/heavy vomiting

-- Loss of appetite

* [Hepatitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis)

---

I should stress here that these causes can eventually be fatal, and thus again urge that you seek medical attention.

---

However, if you are not able or willing to see a doctor, or you simply want to wait to see what happens over the next few days regarding the issue, then these are some tips regarding your lifestyle and how you can perhaps alleviate the issue (assuming it isn't one of the major causes that I listed):

* Start taking a [PPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor). Most I know recommend [Omeprazole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-pump_inhibitor#Examples). Depending on where you are in the world, these will either be OTC (e.g. Omeprazole is Prilosec in the US) or POM. You can take a double dosage per day (i.e. 20mg of Omeprazole every 12 instead of 24 hours) and most likely see increased benefits from doing so. The latter is not recommended unless you are straining your GI tract (which, if you are in this situation, it sounds like you are).

* Once you start taking a PPI, lay off taking any other similar medications (e.g. [Ranitidine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranitidine) (Zantac), [Antacids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antacid#Some_well-known_antacid_brands) (Tums, Pepto), etc) as you will most likely only cause more damage than good. You *can* take an Antacid alongside a PPI, but it is best to leave about four hours between taking each type of medication.

* Try not to vomit. If after 24 hours you still feel the need the vomit, and you have cut back on your CA lifestyle, then you are again advised to see a doctor.

* Avoid putting anything else besides medication (as said, preferably a PPI) in your stomach besides water.

* On that note, only drink water.

* If you have to drink alcohol (due to psychological compulsion and/or physical dependence), try and stick to beer (or similar low ABV drinks, incl. heavily-diluted liquors). Do not quit drinking alcohol cold turkey if you are physically dependent. Seek out medical attention. If this isn't possible, try to taper down your drinking *or* substitute alcohol with an appropriate dosage of [benzos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Alcohol_withdrawal).

* If you have to eat, try to stick to simple carbs and proteins (e.g. white bread and plain cooked chicken). Chew your food very very very well.

* Avoid eating fats and fibres (incl. vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and condiments).

* Avoid eating anything greasy, spicy, creamy, acidic, seasoned, pickled, etc.

* Do not drink soda nor coffee nor juice, etc. These contain stimulants and/or are acidic.

* Avoid caffeine or any other type of stimulant (nicotine, adderall, ritalin, etc).

* Thus, avoid smoking tobacco if you smoke.

* Do not take an [NSAID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAIDs#Classification).

* Avoid taking tablets. Gel caps are your best bet.

* Try and take a multivitamin and cod liver oil (as gel caps).

---

If you do all of the above, and you're still seeing blood after a couple of days, or there are other symptoms still bothering you, then again, to repeat it one more time: please seek out a doctor.

That's all I'm going to cover. This is a serious medical issue, and not something to be taken lightly. Whilst being a CA makes vomiting blood in the long run pretty likely, that does not mean that it couldn't be the result of something pretty serious.

After asking the few people I know, it was determined that I would be going to this thing alone. On my way there I thought ""you know what'd be a great idea dork? If you stopped off at the liquor store and picked up a few hip pocket pints of jim beam.""

so I did. 

I was also an hour early to the movie. So there I am, large pepsi with 2 pints of beam in it, drinking away in a semi-lit theater by myself. I guess its worth noting I had a few before I even ventured out to the theater. I got as far as the opening credits. Was woken up by the cleaning people and I stumbled on out of the theater. 

on my bike ride home I realized I was pretty drunk and should hang out somewhere and sober up for my own safety. so....Strip club. Naturally. Where else does someone go at 11pm on a Thursday to sober up? "	t5_2s68b	True

Step 1 - We admit we are content with our addiction - that our lives are fine.  

Step 2 - Came to believe that alcohol is greater than ourselves.  

Step 3 - Made the decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of alcohol as we understand alcohol.  

Step 4 - Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of our funds to purchase more alcohol.  

Step 5 - Admitted to alcohol, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our drinking habits.  

Step 6 - Were entirely ready to have alcohol improve all these defects of character.  

Step 7 - Humbly asked alcohol to avoid more shortcomings.  

Step 8 - Made a list of all alcohols we have drank with, and became willing to make plans to drink them all again.  

Step 9 - Made direct amends to spilled alcohol whenever possible.  

Step 10 - Continued to take personal inventory of alcohols and when we were low promptly amend that.  

Step 11 - Sought through alcohol and medications to improve our unconscious contact with people on the phone as we understand nothing that's going on, praying only for knowledge of our actions in the morning, and no major repercussions.  

Step 12 - Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to other addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

My post-breakup *rendez-vous* with alcohol turned into a three-year marriage. It started out fun, just drinking with my friends at their house. Then I picked up drinking by myself; the world is less boring through drunken eyes. Having drinks with friends or drinking two glasses of wine does not an alcoholic make. What sets me apart from these strange people?

It didn't take me long to become a regular drinker. I had probably been drunk a dozen times before I started drinking every other day. Oh, the rose-colored glasses that are worn by a 21-year old help little demons like addiction creep up on you. It was beer a few times before it became liquor. I didn't want the calories that it would take for beer or wine to give me a buzz or the fullness of it. I guess this feeling of emptiness should come as no surprise. It has never been a couple of glasses of wine though. Or a few beers. If it starts that way, it will end with a trip to the store to get another liter of vodka: the love of my life. Vodka, she doesn't lie to you. She's got the burn, the taste, doesn't pretend to be what she isn't. She's ethanol, and she tastes like it. She's instant gratification; she burns you the right way. I know the good vodka, the finest vodka, the best deal for your dollar vodka, the cheap vodka, the shit that gives you hangovers, the first vodka I ever drank, but I don't know the last. Always buy out of glass bottles, never plastic. Plastic bottles are indicative of desperation, and you aren't that far-gone, *yet*. *You don't have a problem.* Alcoholics aren't getting their doctorates in genetics; they’re selling themselves for a Colt 45 or even worse, a Four Loko. Alcoholics drink all of the time; you only drink at night. Alcoholics live for one thing, that drink. *Wait*...what do you live for?

Okay, *fine*, you drink too much. Let's replace the vodka with wine and restrict drinking to the weekends. Wait, where'd that bottle of wine go? *Fuck it, go get vodka.* It's cheaper and more bang for your buck. But it's Tuesday. *Kristen, when has this ever worked?* How many times have you sung this song? How many times was it pleasant to listen to? You’re not even a good singer, but you are bored and lonely and you think too much. Just drink until you’re as good at singing as you are at…whatever you’re good at. You'll figure it out later.

I did figure it out.

I've always been a binge drinker. Always. Once I pop, the fun don't stop. I always tell people that, jokingly, when I get asked to drink in afternoon, and they laugh. It's funny. I'm funny. But they don't know the truth of it. Those two beers are going to give me a slight buzz, but a slight buzz is nowhere near where I need to be. And that need is going to take precedent over anything else for the rest of the day, anything productive, anyway. Maybe I'll play some Spades, if I keep a handle on it, a movie, I'll fuck, I'll talk, but if I drink too much, I'll be offensive. I might turn into an overly empathetic sponge and absorb every bit of information someone tells me about their life. These days, however, I’m offending more people than wiping tears away, not playing Spades, and my love for drunken movie nights has waned. I'm not doing much of anything when I drink except cry. I cry and cry and cry. Not about a relationship ending or worrying about failing my exam for candidacy or even things like my cat meowing at the door when I leave the apartment (I would cry about that sober). I'm just sad, and my vessel for desensitization has become an enhancer. Once I pop, the fun don't stop? Yes, I will drink until I get drunk, keep drinking until I am too drunk to stay awake, and I'll probably cry before I fall asleep.

Then the hangover.

The hangovers! There are so many kinds. People don't realize the range of hangovers one can experience; one being someone who drinks so much they classify their hangovers. There’s the simple headache, probably the result of a decent buzz off of some cheap wine. There’s the “I drank nothing but liquor, not a drop of water” hangover; with those, I will dry heave at least three times once I wake up. The drinking and crying hangover results in a puffy face and a hazy mind. And a headache. “Holy hell, how am I not dead?” equals vomiting, nausea for a couple of hours afterward, and not much movement for the entire day. My personal favorite is the “I drank as much water as I did liquor”, the mental hangover, where the mind is so hazy you can’t navigate through it. Not a lot of thinking goes on, but crap certainly does spew out of the mouth (let’s face it, it spews the other way regardless of the type of hangover); it can spew so much that you submit an epiphany you had about drinking to r/cripplingalcoholism. For every McDonald’s Dollar Menu item you eat, a hangover-contributing drink is neutralized. No, beer won’t hydrate you, and drinking soda is not the same as drinking water. Do you remember when being hungover meant not wanting to touch alcohol with a ten foot pole, much less drink it? Yeah, me neither.

Okay, so every now and then I will go a day without drinking, like once a month. I’ll be generous, though, and throw a couple extra days of sobriety in there. That means I have been intoxicated (drunk), on average, 350 out of 365 god-given days per year, for over three years. Whoa. Wait! Make that 348.2 out of 365. I forgot that April in 2011 where I sobered up and exercised…but did I end up drinking on the weekends…Hmm…Whatever. *Wait*, that was over two years ago? *Shit…*

I decided I was going to try another one of those months of sobriety a week ago. My friend’s 21st birthday was the epic night of drinking that triggered both a “Holy hell, how am I not dead?” hangover and revelation. Naturally, since it was not my 21st birthday party, I had 2 vodka cranberries, 6 vodka tonics, 2 shots of vodka, and some tequila shot over the course of 4 hours. I had eaten next to nothing all day. Shortly after my final drink, I argued with the birthday boy, threw up in the bathroom, and managed to find my friends, only after I had started to cry. I do not remember any of this. I started to dry-heave in the bushes, which turned into me trying to make myself vomit, to no avail. I continued this desperate act of gagging myself the entire ride home, except for when I frantically called for my loyal friend, Ronald McDonald. Yes, no level of drunkenness can dampen my instinct to eat McDonalds. As soon as I walked/fell through my apartment door, I began doing something I had never done before: drink water so I could throw it up. That turned into drinking water so I could make myself throw it up. The McDonalds even went uneaten. My roommate, who has seen every level of my drunken range, said this was the most drunk she had ever seen me. Then again, she cleaned the carpet when I spilled the bowl I was vomiting into--yes, *bowl*--I would be a little biased after that too. The next morning, I decided to make a plan, which was “no alcohol for 30 days” to begin after Fourth of July weekend because, who am I kidding, I would have never made it over the long weekend!

I didn’t make it 30 days anyway. I made it 6. The one time I decided to sober up for myself, not for a boyfriend or for my grandmother, but for me, and I couldn’t make it a week. I feel bad all. of. the. time. And my friend vodka, at the very least, is contributing to it, if not the culprit. After three days of anxiety, sleeplessness, and nausea, I finally felt better. I was sleeping like a baby. I was reading, painting, getting things done, I was doing this sobriety thing (but only for 30 days). And now I’m hungover. I could have slept 8 hours instead of 5, I could be reading the grant proposal I should have read 4 weeks ago, but I’m not. I went to a party, put myself in a position to drink, and of course, did (it was a going away party, otherwise I would have stayed home). Instead of staying at the party until 11 pm, like my roommate and I planned, or turning around once we were close, like she suggested, I stayed until 4 am. One drink became six. Six drinks is a heavy night of drinking for most people. It means a good buzz and no hangover for me! Six drinks was not indicative of the bigger problem, six drinks didn't make me realize I might be something more than an alcohol abuser; it was the battle that waged inside of my head when I was confronted with an open bottle of whiskey. Six drinks ended up becoming tears and McDonalds and a mental hangover, per usual. And this. This long anecdote which is helping me come to terms with a simple truth that temporary sobriety won't change: I cannot drink alcohol. Not in 30 days, not in 10 years, not in moderation, not once per year. Never.

I’ve been writing this like it is a joke to me. It isn’t. And I know it isn’t funny to anyone reading this. I have less than 5 years of heavy drinking under my belt, and I’m a 25 year-old who knows next to nothing. Some people drink twice as much as me and have been doing so for 3 decades. Some people lose their job, their family, their dignity, their life. Some people can drink every day and be unaffected by it. Hell, drinking in moderation is good for you. An apple a day keeps the doctor away? How about ‘a glass of red wine keeps your health in line’ (we should make that a commonly-used phrase). There is a genetic basis to this, and I am one of the lucky people with this predisposition. Addiction stole both of my parents from me. My mother couldn’t smoke crack-cocaine in moderation, so she quit. My father and his brother couldn’t drink alcohol in moderation, so they both quit; his other brother is dying of alcoholism. If I am acknowledging a pattern in my twenties, what will I be like in my thirties, and why would I continue to tread these murky waters? My life has only started to unravel, and alcohol is not glue. It will not put me back together. It will evaporate, as ethanol readily does, and all the holes and gaps it filled won’t disappear with it. And I can’t keep pouring. I have become so good at pouring that I have forgotten why I started in the first place, and the best things about me fade a little more with every drink I consume. They’ll be gone along with the plethora of wonderful things and people in my life unless I eliminate one thing. Just this one little thing. My source of pleasure, pain, entertainment, laughter, melancholy, confusion, clarity, boldness, sense of self, sense of nothing: alcohol. *Just get rid of it.*

But I don't know where to begin. And forever is a long time.

Well CA, I'm out for a while. My mother tried to put me into a 5 week in-patient rehab on Sunday. 

I agreed to a 72 hour medical inpatient detox, only because if I were to stay at the facility for 5 weeks straight I would have to go to jail for 1-3 years when I got out. It's a long story and if you call/pm me I'd be happy to explain if you're really that interested in the intricacies of my life.

I'm going to stay sober until July 3rd. We'll see how I feel then about the ol' bottle I've loved so dearly for the past ten years.

Even though it wasn't my choice to detox (my mother begged me to go, and basically had a mental breakdown when I refused the 5 week in-patient), I've known for a long time that I need to take a break. A long break. Possibly a forever break.

I know this is vague, I've written it that way for a reason, but I'll do an AMA on support chat an hour before the scheduled time on Saturday if anyone is interested/has had similar experiences and needs/wants to give advice.

I'll still be stopping by support chat just to see if anyone turns up by the way. You won't see me in chat proper for a little while though. I'm still subbed here and don't plan on leaving. And those of you on facebook, I'll still be around there being ridiculous.

At the reception, I see a couple of cousins and we begin to talk about the sad shit that's brought us together in the past and how much happier we were to be getting together for something that wasn't a funeral.

That was a week ago.  I'm now fully embracing those maudlin memories.  My grandfather died ""after a long illness"".  Dude stroked out and cacked it.  My grandmother, our fucking rock, had to bury her second husband.  We twenty-somethings gathered around and tried to console her as best we could.  For her, it was getting as many of his possessions out of her sight as quickly as possible.  For us, it was trying to get her shit-faced enough to sleep alone in the same bed she'd shared with a now-dead man for the past thirty fucking years.

Somehow, we all made it through until the next day.  We paid our respects, buried the guy, had shitty midwestern brunch and all gathered back at grandma's place.

I don't know how it happened, but the eldest cousins of every branch of the family tree ended up in Grandma's Basement at the same time.  Except we weren't arguing about who got the car in Monopoly - it was just time to empty out grampa's beer cooler.

We set about it with a passion.  And a thirst.  Apparently, burying a relative is dry work.  When the cooler got low, all our eyes turned to The Bottle.

That Bottle.  The one that had been sitting there for as long as any of us could remember.  The one we were never allowed to touch on pain of grampa bending us over and whipping the shit out of us.  Grampa's Cherry ""Brandy""

Mason jar, with a seal that's never been cracked.  Pristine, golden-red liquor.  And the poor, dumb asshole never tasted it.  As one, we looked at each other and then we decided that the youngest oldest brother (me) should be the one to walk back upstairs amongst the bereaved to fetch glasses.

I'd like to think I did it with a modicum of dignity.  Probably not, tho.  I retrieved glasses and shockingly did not break a one on the way back down the steps.  Everyone got their glass and we looked expectantly at the eldest cousin as he prepared to open The Bottle.

Fucker couldn't do it.  That shit was stuck tight.  It took two dudes on the cap and two on the bottle proper to finally crack that shit.  And once they did - man.  The smell was...thirty year old homemade fermented cherries.

We poured, we toasted, we drank, we grimaced.  All of that threat of pain and that dumb old fuck couldn't have just drank this bullshit himself.  Or tossed it at a passing alley cat.  Sweetest, shittiest drink ever.

I awoke (from a blackout) to myself cooking bacon, eggs, and asparagus this morning in a beautiful haze. I hopped off chat with people I love or got kicked for some reason but none of that matters. What matters is what I saw upon truly waking.

I had a long talk with my mother(who I have in the last few years had to move back in with) about my brother and his passions. He is a doctorate student, a brilliant photographer, and a hell of a good looking guy. I love the man to death. I spent my unemployed and completely drunk morning talking with my mother about how she should just love him and let him pursue his dream of being a photographer. 

But it was a civil conversation over me having breakfast and her having opinions. It was our own special kind of talk since they are few and far between. 

We talked of his aspirations, my shortcomings, and her disappointment in completely reasonable measures. All and all, I felt like a real person for once. 

After the talk, I went outside to shave the ice off her car like any indebted man would do, and I found the time to sit and have a cigarette. While sitting there, smoking, and looking out on the great winter ""wonderland"" that my town had become over night, a strange and all too comforting calm came upon me.

Life may have it's ups and mostly downs, but I can't help but feel I still belong here when I look out on the world, busy as a bee, with smokes in my pocket, booze in my fridge, food in my belly, and a song in my heart over how beautiful the simplest pleasures may be. It's not often that I feel this, nor often that I long to live: but as I lay my head back down to sleep, it feels good to know that I have a community(albeit online) of people that accept me for me, understand my constant drunken shenanigans, and place no judgement upon me.

R/CA, I am an alcoholic. I will never change, and sometimes I wish the world would cease turning because of it, but today? 

Today has been an incredible great and simple day.

I love you all. Enjoy your day at work. I'm going to bed

1343749110.0	xgbgr	So I didn't drink yesterday.		78	14	7	"Yeah, a whole fucking day. Working twelve hours in a factory I couldn't figure out why I felt sick, what was wrong with my stomach? Why the fuck did I feel sick, queasy? 

Fuck, it's probably just my diet, the adderall, stress, this shitty job, too much coffee too much stress everything is just too much...

What a shitfuck of a night it was. Seven AM rolls around somehow and I've made it through another night of this monotony and meaningless activity, and I spot this Mexican I work with, lets call him Marco. 

Wanna get a beer? Yeah sure man. 

Glad this bar opens at seven AM, and everyone in it except for maybe two people are from the factory we work at. These people know how to live, they know what to do after you spend twelve hours doing mindless labor that kills your soul. Or maybe they're just enjoying a few too many drinks before they go home to their families. Maybe I just have a fucked up disposition and I see the world in the wrong light. Maybe maybe maybe. 

It was one beer--that's what we said, at least. Good conversation, he's a cool guy, I'd been meaning grab a drink with him for a while now. He came in with me, same group of trainees, and out of that group of 15 there are *maybe* five of us left. Two beers, then three. I want to drink more but he's gotta go...Probably good anyways, I don't need to get a DUI. I might be a crippled alcoholic but no sense in killing someone. I'll get drunk in bed. Fuck, that sounds even better. 

That was three hours ago, and now my bottle of Johnny Walker Red is half empty. Work again at 7PM. Twelve more hours, then I'm off the hook for a couple days unless they force me into overtime. 

Should be sleeping but it won't come. Only more drinks. I keep scrolling up to edit this post, make it sound right and not piss you fuckers off or get banned but who the fuck am I trying to please? Some of you won't be fucked to read this and some of you will downvote for whatever reasons. I digress, where was I going anyways?

I didn't decide to quit drinking yesterday, just read some of the advice on my first post here and well, some of you made me reconsider. For a day. Nice try you bastards. I appreciate it, but well, I guess now it really hits me. 

I feel great. That sickness, the queasiness, the anxiety, the feeling like something is wrong...it's all gone. The world is suddenly bright and colorful and it all seems very tolerable, after that first drink or two. And after the bottom of the bottle, well maybe there will be some sleep...

It might just kill me. I was going to die anyways though. I can't help myself. Cheers.

 I had been out at a new and unfamiliar bar for most of the afternoon &amp; thought it about time to head home. However, after the copious amounts of booze, finding the right bus and then getting off at the correct stop proved to be an imposible task.

I look at my watch &amp; realize that it's already 2:15 and if I was going to aimlessly wander, I needed more alcohol. I poped into a corner store, bought an 18 pack of beer, and continued wandering in the genreal direction of home. 

At about 3am I realized that I had dropped my lighter and couldn't light the cig now hanging out of my mouth. As a girl wandered past me I flagged her down and asked if she had a light. She obliged, and I noticed she actually had 3 lighters in her pocket. ""Hey, I'll trade ya a beer for one of your lighters."" She agreed and I got a lighter!

About half an hour after that I felt the need to relieve myself. As a girl, pissing in public is kind of a bitch, so I called out to a couple people stumbling into their apartment, ""Hey, I've got a beer for each of you if you let me use your bathroom!"" They agreed and I found myself in some strange apartment with 5-10 strangers. We drank for a while, shot the shit, then I wandered home.

I usually carry a large bag, and have now decided to always keep a couple beers next to my flask. Flask for me, beer for barter.

I've come to find it surprising that long-haul truck drivers are not the highest suicidal demographic. I mean Jesus Christ, truly being alone with your brain is a scary fucking prospect for a lot of people, myself included. Introspection, fear, reflection, and doubt all come rushing in and not having a bottle at hand along with some kind of instant distraction, be it through books, internet, film or any media of choice,  really is the plight of the 21st century alcoholic. 

Solitude is lovely; self-sabotaging solitude is not. The line of demarcation between the two is not static and it's most certainly not visible when you're drowning in booze. The worst thing about about stumbling across that line is not a loss of motivation to crawl back over, but a loss of the courage to even care enough to try.

This is not a resolution. Fuck resolutions - they are for people who have something to prove to the world and we all could give two shits about what people think of us, though we'd all *prefer* to be loved. This is more of a conviction. I know I will never get sober. I know that I will make more bad decisions than good ones. I know the worst isn't over. We will piss off more people than we please and we'll respond with a shrug. 

Will things get better? Who the fuck knows, so cheers to another year. I hope that we all survive it. Much love to you all.

1314250464.0	jtqxj	My near death experience and detox. [WARNING: Wall of Text]	texpundit	87	26	60	"Well, a lot of you CAers know most of my back story, but some of the noobs might not, so I'll start at the beginning.

I grew up dirt poor on a subsistence farm in the middle of rural south Texas. Due to my grandfather and his german and scottish background, I got my first little beer glass at 7 years old. Every time he would pop open a Buckhorn, Lone Star or Pearl, I was right there with my little glass and he'd give me just a little bit. That was my first taste of booze.

That ended as I got older and I went boozeless until I was about 16. When I was 15-16 I raced motocross. When I was 16, I ended my last race with two motorcycles on my right leg. With nothing else to do, me and my small group of misfit friends start drinking...almost exclusively on weekends.

Fast-forward to age 23: After playing in a string of go-nowhere bands, I end up hooking up with a couple guys and starting a band that became *very* niche popular *very* fast. My drinking gradually increased over the 11 years from weekends to every other night and weekends to pretty much every night when I took on extra work as a strip club DJ and bouncer. Also during those 11 years, I was webmaster of a small but popular software company, the webmaster for the city I lived in, major online content producer for the local newspaper and creative director for an advertising firm. I'd run out of job options and was drinking pretty much every night. Also, during this time, I racked up 3 DWIs and a host of other alcohol related jail stays.

My friend up here in DC needed a roommate and help with founding a startup non-profit organization (I also had a long term freelance project I was working on, so I had income when I moved here), I needed a fresh start, so I moved. One way plane ticket, 4 bags of laundry and a laptop. For the first year I was here, I cut back my drinking a lot.

One year after I move here, I luck into a wonderful, high-profile job that made me many friends and colleagues (some of which you can see on the major news networks as experts and talking heads), but was extremely stressful, even though I *loved* the work. Being stressed constantly, I got back to drinking every day. The minute I got off work, I'd head to happy hour and start drinking. This drinking eventually got worse and worse.

Fast forward 5 years and I basically drink myself out of the job (mid March of this year). With nothing left to do (no job, no band, no hobbies, no real motivation), I proceed to start drinking all day every day. I dry myself out a few times, but relapsed rather quickly after each attempt.

About 2 months ago, I self-detox and my dry lasts about a week. I put myself on the keto diet in order to lose some weight and try to get some motivation back into my life. The problem is, I'm drinking like a fish at the time. What I didn't remember is that alcohol stores itself in fat cells. The keto diet forces your body to burn its own fat for energy instead of carbs. In order to stabilize the weight loss, you also eat lots of fat.

So, while sucking down booze like it's going out of style, I'm storing tons of alcohol into the the fat I'm taking in, along with the alcohol that's already stored in the fat already in my body. When my body burns the fat, it releases a FLOOD of alcohol into my system along with what I'm already drinking...which, by this time, is A LOT. I was up to roughly a half handle of whiskey a day if not more.

**(BIG NOTE: I didn't realize about the whole diet making things exponentially worse until just Monday afternoon.)**

For the last 3 weeks or so, my shakes had gotten so bad due to alcohol withdrawal (because I was absolutely flooding my system with alcohol) that when I got to the bar at happy hour, I had to use both hands to get the first few whiskey shots to my mouth. I was at the point of having to get my BAC up to about .15 to .20 *just to get rid of the shakes* and feel semi-normal. I was paranoid all the time that everyone could tell how bad off I was and I was filled with so much shame I cried at night.

In the last 2 weeks, my withdrawals were getting so severe that they would wake me up in the middle of the night, just a couple hours after I had stopped drinking, so about a week and a half ago, I start taking Unisom (an over the counter benzo sleep aid) just to sleep through those shakes and get more than an hour or two of sleep. I went through a 32 count bottle of 50mg Unisoms in roughly a week. I was having to take up to the maximum daily dosage (300mg or 6 pills) just to get a few extra hours sleep. I empty the bottle Tuesday of last week. It's also at this time I realize I am WAY past trying to taper so that I can detox myself again.

Note that on top of all this, I've had bouts of high blood pressure since I was around 24 and I was also diagnosed with clinical depression at the same time. I wasn't on meds for either condition.

Also note that about 4 years ago, my father drank himself to death at the age of roughly 75. My sister had to go to this ratty little cabin apartment in the middle of nowhere and identify his body. She told me that he was so bloated it looked like he had been pregnant with triplets. Also, his entire apartment was covered in empty Jack Daniels bottles. *Hundreds* of them.

Back to last Wednesday night and I'm looking at my (then) current condition and reliving what my mother and sister went through with my father's death and all the shame and guilt I was feeling for ending up just like him (I couldn't stand the guy. He was the drunk I never wanted to be but eventually turned into.) and I lost it. I had a depressive breakdown, but I also had an epiphany: I *can't* keep living like this. If I do I *will* die, probably soon...and I *refuse* to make my mother and sister go through that again. I love them too much and no mother should have to outlive her own son.

So, Thursday, under an alt account, I put out a desperate plea for help on the WashDC subreddit for detox information. I get a flood of info and decide to check into a place very near my apartment. I've never been to a full-blown inpatient detox, so I know jack shit about them. The one I end up checking into is a social detox, which means cold turkey and they just watch you. I didn't know this.

Friday, I proceed to drink my apt dry so that I don't have any booze to come back to after detox and clean up as best I can. I then call and set up for intake on Saturday. I go in Saturday morning with a horrible set of shakes. The incept people know something's up. They take my vitals all day.

By the time the afternoon rolls around my blood pressure is up to 186/111. I was probably 2 hours or less away from a seizure/stroke/heart attack. In other words: **fucking dead**.

The people proceed to take me to the ER at a local hospital with a world class detox unit and drop me off. The ER gets me fixed up so that I don't die on the spot. The ER doc also decides that I need controlled, inpatient detox (with the drugs and monitoring and everything) which is what I was looking for in the first place. I spend Saturday night through Tuesday morning under heavy monitoring, controlled detox.

I now have a prescription for high blood pressure meds and a new lease on life. I'm sober and I feel better than I have in over a decade. I'm happy. I feel healthy. This is the best thing I think I've ever done for myself in my life.

Also, *it scared me boozeless*. I see beer commercials and get an ""ewwww"" reaction. But, for me, that's good. This is something I've needed to do for a long time and I'm infinitely glad I did.

I guess the reason I'm venting this is as a cautionary tale. If you're going to booze, watch yourself. Watch your health. Remember that unless you're absolutely alone in this world, ending up like me at my lowest point *does* affect other people. Most likely, people that love you.

1370821014.0	1g0e12	I passed out in the wrong tent camping.	WonTonBurritoMeals	71	12	31	"So camping with my college buddy in a state park in Indiana for a disc golf tournament that we did while I was living in Indiana. Even though I didnt live there and was broke, he insisted we go back this year and fronted most of the bill. It was sponsered by the Fraternal Order of Police so there were cops everywhere. Despite this, we arrive at about 7:30am with a cooler that we had prepped bottles of gatorade and vodka to sip on throughout the tournament. Got a decent buzz, had some fun, didnt win our division by a long shot but it was great. 

We head back to the campsite with some booze and food to cook on the fire. Everything was going smoothly and the 3 camping lots adjacent to us were empty and we were drinking and being surly. All of a sudden all these super hot high school looking chicks roll up in bikinis and start camping in all 3 adjacent camping sites. The whole campsite took notice as they set their tents up and what not. There was probably 8 or so girls and 4-5 guys, and we noticed they spoke more French then English. After they set up camp the leader (teacher) tried to start a fire in the fire pit. We see them struggle for about 10 mins, they ask to borrow a lighter, but they were getting only smoke and no flames. We go over and notice their 'fire' consisted of dumping a bag of non-self starting charcoal and trying to use our lighter to get it started. We give them a news paper and two of our logs and tell them to get kindling and all that to get going.

Thirty minutes later still nothing. We decide to take our cameras out and take a picture of their epic failure and one openly declares ""Theyre taking pictures of us"" and we laugh sort of embarrassed and finally go over and basically do it for them.

The night goes on as any camping adventure would, drinking and hollering, fires everywhere, they were all laughing. We found out they were from a French school in Chicago that brings rich kids from France to America to go through high school.

We proceed to get pretty wasted and because it was such a long day of discing and boozing we hit the bed. I recall waking up and taking a piss in the woods nearby where the campfire of French kids were all talking. They probably saw me but fuck em. I shamble back to my tent and zonk out hard.

But it wasnt my tent. It was the teachers tent and it just happened to look exactly like my tent and have the exact same layout of bedding and shit. I was awoken sometime in the middle of the night by a group of them poking me with a stick.

Somewhat sobered up I freaked the fuck out and tried to not look like a rapist. I shambled back to my tent and they were all laughing at me, those fucking frogs.

We tried to leave before they woke up, starting packing at like 7am. But probably 10 mins before we were done loading up the teacher wakes up, walks slowly over towards our campsite and hands me my house keys. We laugh and I apologize and say I meant no harm. She said I was giving them all the middle finger and saying 'fuck you' over and over when they woke me up. No recollection. Dont even think I drank that much honestly.

My eye is stinging at this point and I can feel it dripping off of my chin as if I were Bree Olsen. I immediately interrupt any ongoing transactions and loudly ask for a paper towel or a napkin. I'm not sure how many people were actually in the store at the time because I couldn't see and didn't care.

Lucky for me, I've been coming there for 2 years and the clerk knows I'm just a harmless drunk, so, she stops whatever she's doing and goes into the garage to get me some paper towels. I cleaned up best I could and purchased my poison. I'm certain she was thinking the same thing I was as we gave each-other sniggering looks about my predicament. Too bad she has a mustache.

Nearly lost my life once through my own hands and once through my state of general health. I'm alive because I'm lucky to have a very good wife and a very good doctor and psychologist.

So please people be careful. If you're new to this place, and if you're young, get the hell out as fast as you can. The longer you stay this way the worse it gets. I'm not that old yet, but I can talk about the 20past years drinking. Or better.. using alcohol as my medication. I know for sure if I addressed the underlying issues at that point I could have been a happier man. Because honestly, appart from the joy of being drunk there isn't much to enjoy about puking, sweating, shaking, dizziness, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, fucked up stomachs, pancreas, and the whole fucking shit that goes with it.

I see a lot of young people here. And honestly. you guys don't belong here. It's not worth it, it's certainly not cool in any way. Sure you're the last man standing at the bar and that might be consider cool by your peers.

But consider this. 10 years later down the line you will wake up at 4am in the morning in withdrawal, having a job to go to at 7am. Shaking and reach for the hidden vodka bottle trying not to wake your wife and kids. Down a quater of it just so you can sleep for another hour and then hope in the morning no one will notice the booze smell, which by the way you will need to do the by noon and in the evening for every fucking day of your life because you cannot go without it, hoping every day your boss will not fire you and your wife won't leave you and your life won't collapse on you.

Try to think of every social situation a normal adult does, and try seeing you do it intoxicated. Go to soccer practice with the kids.. sure.. socialize with other parents.. sure.. all reeking of booze. People will think very highly of you. 

think about this .. if you think we're cool.

and don't give me shit about medical help is too expensive. you spend more on booze then you would on a shrink to help you with your fucking issues.

Eventually I was dropped off at the station. Went in and the counter clerk was no where to be seen for 15 minutes give or take. All the sudden she popped up from under the counter, buttoning her shirt. I think she was sleeping or fucking someone.  

I tried to check my bag and she said I couldn't bring my bag on because the zipper was broken, which I understand can be a pain if everything were to fall out mid trip. I tried explaining that my ticket was bought online, so I didn't have a paper one. This took about 5-10 minutes for her to understand. She asked for my ID and I gave it to her and she dropped it and said ""This fucking thing is nasty, I can't deal with this."" and gave me back my ID then walked away. I plan on filing a complaint in the near future.  

So I said fuck it and thought I should just try to hitchhike home. The problem with this is that I had no idea how, and my phone was broken and it's battery about do die. So I just started walking.  

I ended up coming across a traveler by the name of Hiker who we had met earlier, so I joined him for a bit and spanged about $5, then went off to find a liquor store which I eventually did. Then I kept walking, looking for a good on ramp to sit at, but got drunk in the process and lost. I ended up walking train tracks for a bit and came across a busted up building covered in grafitti and decided to take a nap.  

I woke somewhat more sober and logical thinking and walked back to the greyhound station. The same counter girl was there and still being a bitch. She said I was too drunk to get on a bus. I told her that I would let the driver be the judge of that, since I has 4-5 hours for my bus to leave.  

I eventually got on to this crowded bus. During the trip I did start to withdraw, and the bus was too crowded for me to get to the bathroom, so I ended up puking into my pillowcase on the bus. I felt really bad for the guy next to me.  

Thankfully the columbus to dayton bus was less crowded and I could lay down, and ninja puke into my pillowcase. I got back to dayton at around 7AM.  

Now comes the part of me getting home from greyhound. I had foolishly spent my money on beer and vodka and now had no money to catch a local bus to my apartment. I was also starting to get bad withdrawals, so I slept at the greyhound station until they kicked me out, I have no idea when. Tried spanged bus fare, but that was useless, so I started walking, thinking it wasn't that far of a walk. 10 miles really isn't that hard of a walk for me, but withdrawing it was fucking awful. Every few blocks I had to stop and puke, usually in an inconspicuous place, but I do recall puking in front of a really beautiful house with a well kept yard and getting odd looks.  

At one point I got to a library and asked facebook for help, but time ran out for library internet, so I moved on, got to the center of town, randomly puking in trashcans and getting more odd looks and was called a worthless junkie by some old lady.  

Tried spanging bus fare a bit more, but downtown is mostly unemployed and jail releases that are on most corners during the day so I said fuck it and walked the rest of the way.  

When I got home I went through the worst withdrawals I think I've ever had. I sat in cold water in my bathtub for a couple hours, puking in the toilet, then went fetal position next to the toilet until about 9AM this morning, when I was finally capable of moving again. I still feel awful, but at least I am not puking anymore, and even got some food in me.  

I still had a ton of fun at the meetup, and despite the shitshow travels home, I would do it again.

I used to drive around for hours on end in this 1967 mercedes that I restored.  I would drink beer and listen to the radio.  Back roads in west Michigan.  Sometimes I would drive all night only stopping ever hour or two to buy another six pack.  I would stop on some back road to pee, right in the middle of the road, middle of the night, not a car in sight.  I would leave the door open with the radio playing and just piss in the road and drink my beer and look at the sky.  Those are some of my best memories.  I've been married twice and have two kids.  I'm 45 now and I can't say I've ever been happier than that.  I decided against the bar.  When I drove by it was lit up inside like christmas and I could see everybody having fun.  It kind of freaked me out so I just drove home.  I'm about 7 shots into a half gallon of vodka right now and I'm just getting started.  I wont remember writing this post.  I'm gonna wet the 
bed tonight.  Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up sick and sorry but around noon I'll have another shot and things will get better from there.  God damn I miss that car.

By the end of it all my liver was in such a state that I was forced to hit up the hospital where I was rushed to the ER for X-Rays, an ultrasound, bloodwork &amp; the usual chilled IVs and a little valium (which helped for about 6 hours).Test results reveal that my gall bladder &amp; kidneys are in good shape but my liver is enlarged and not doing so great. So I'm forced to detox for a while. Could be 10 days... Could be 30... Who knows. I'm doing this on my own, not in rehab but with the support of fellow CAs.

The reason for this post is to thank everyone (you know who you are) who has/is helping me through this dark time and have helped me continuously throughout any of my problems, CA related or not. I love you CA. Through the good and bad. You've always been here for me, and I'll do my god damn best to always be there for you, through thick and thin.

This is by no means a retirement post. I'm not leaving CA, and I'm sure as fuck not quitting drinking. I just wanted to thank a certain few and let others out there know that when times are down this community will come together and help those in need. Why? Because this is by far the most supportive fucking community on Reddit. Period.

My early days of drinking, I was fun, witty, sociable. And I was able to balance it with a relatively responsible life with ease.

The years go by, I acquire a few material possessions, and frankly, just become bored with life.  This is where the fun, sociable Stu turned into the shitfaced drunk every night Stu. I started engaging in behaviors like driving drunk at two in the morning on a Tuesday to play in an
 illegal poker game just because the thrill of maybe getting caught made me feel alive. 

I tried to stay married. Really I did. Didn't run around on her, paid the bills. And she still liked me because big shiny house, vacations and unbridled shopping sprees.

Now we're in act 3. You know me as the single dad, working a great job, rising from the ashes. And that's true, to an extent. 

Sober Stu is a friendly, hard working, funny, giving, doting father, relatively healthy kind of guy.

Drunk Stu is a self serving, completely disregarding of others, self destructive shit show from whom most people want to immediately disassociate.

So I'm back to the delicate balancing act. I can't fuck this job up, and I can't fuck this parenting up, and I won't. But it makes me sick. 

I would, at all times, rather be the selfish drunk asshole than the nice responsible member of society. And I am resigned that that will never change. I will always get completely blackout drunk at every opportunity, even going so far as to create calendar events to do so.

I will always be just enough of a selfish prick to prevent anyone from ever getting close to me.

What was meant to be some relax and chill juice must have turned into way more. The details are a bit blurry up until I blacked out.

What I do remember, is running to Swensen's for a burger, and going to pick up more vodka. It was apparently the best burger I've had in my life and I went back for another one. I'm not sure if I came back to the office or just went right back after the liquor run. I'm probably quite obviously lit by now. He says, ""Weren't you here earlier?"" I said, ""It was good!""

On my way back to the office I see the lights behind me. I don't remember being even a little bit concerned. I pull over with my expired tags and 2 bottles of vodka in the passenger seat and wait patiently. I guess I had gone right through a red light. He asks me, and I think I just shook my head and mumbled something drunk. He asks for my proof of insurance, I hand him my registration. He HAS to know I'm wasted. But by the grace of The Flying Spaghetti Monster, he sends me off with a warning.

I'm pretty much on my third strike with my girlfriend. The next day I wake up and can't remember how I got home, how I got in bed, or anything. My girlfriend is gone. I'm sick to my stomach. Not because I'm hung over, but surely I woke her up stumbling in. She probably took my clothes off, put me to bed, and told me we're done.

All morning I was sweating and sick wondering how the night ended. Finally around noon, I get the text. ""What time did you get in last night? I didn't hear you come in.""

Are you fucking kidding me? My ninja skills are still active when black-out drunk? I can't believe I suffered no consequences for such foolishness. I haven't had a problem with drinking and driving for years. Somehow I lost control that night.

I'm just going to watch shows and shit, but seriously, I would kill for another beer or 5. It's too fucking cold to even bother walking to a store too, so even if I had money I wouldn't fucking bother.  

So this post is for you fuckers that have started drinking only to find out that you don't have enough. Share stories please!  

I'll respond eventually but i'm in that fucking ""I'm not drunk enough to pass out and probably crazy"" mode. "	t5_2s68b	True

RustisMaximus	65	8	35	"So last night I did my usual stay up until 2am watching classic Doctor Who (I finished Rememberance of the Daleks, Tomb of the Cybermen, Earthshock and something else I don't remember) while drinking copious amounts of booze.

I get woken up this morning and told that ""my drinking is problematic to the family blah blah blah WORDS"" and I'm...fuck you.

How the fuck is this a problem? I don't go to bars, don't drive drunk, am probably the sweetest and most passive drunk in existence (seriously, people used to ENCOURAGE me to get drunk since I turn the sweetness up to 10) and am quiet. I pay all my shit on time, show up when I'm supposed to, my only vice is alcohol.

But no, getting tanked and watching Doctor Who is a ""problem"" now. What the fuck?!

This morning I wake up to more cranberry juice (yay) a Rockstar Recovery in my fridge (the yellow one) and ANOTHER HANDLE OF VODKA.

I asked him why he bought me more and he said ""I looked in the freezer before I left, you'd be out tonight, figured I'd take care of it in advance so we could skip the store tonight or whatever. Love you baby.""

I was having a real real bad day/night mulling over some really dark shit from my past (don't worry I'm not gonna whine, we all go through shit). And this girl I've been seeing (who I think may be a CA based on the fact that she drinks like me) did the nicest thing ever to cheer me up. She ran to the liquor store nearby and bought me a bottle of [Macallan 18](http://www.klwines.com/detail.asp?sku=620010) (I couldn't afford it but she's pretty damn financially well off) and then proceeded to suggest we just get drunk. I don't like burning through amazing scotch very fast because I think it needs to be enjoyed and not slammed.

My parents came home (a bit earlier than expected, but still) and saw the shitshow I and the house had become. I'm clearly two-weeks hammered and about to have to stop, so they figure taking me to the hospital's probably the best idea. We get there, I'm at about .3, I end up tearing my IV out because I'm bored and want to leave, they scold and discharge me with instructions to return if I vomit repeatedly, see any hallucinations, have any stomach pains or delerium/disorientation. After probably my worst night of ""sleep"" ever, I consult the list and I'm indeed experiencing several of the symptoms. I vomit bile (worst shit...) twice again before we leave. We return, I have to wait an hour before the first doctor arrives, I get admitted for extended detox.

So that's it. I'm lying here in bed next to an IV that won't shut up. I gotta stop for a (hopefully long) while. All in all, I lost a job, missed a concert and a speech and debate tournament I was supposed to judge at, and totally almost died. Hallucinations are fucking irritating, and so's this IV I have to drag around, but I gotta get my shit together. I may see you fuckers later, I may not. Wish me luck."	t5_2s68b	True

&gt; I make this return to facebook to tell you all that I've finished my master's degree. In the course of the past three and a half years, I've lost my wife, my house, and everything I owned save custody of my daughter. I've fallen into the depths of depression and alcoholism previously unseen, but I've come out alive, and hopefully gainfully employed. A sincere thanks to those of you who've stuck by me. The next chapter begins now.

Surprisingly, a shitton of people responded.  Not with your standard run of the mill, ""Oh, it's nice to hear from you,"" kind of crap.  More along the lines of, ""Oh my God!  That's fucking inspirational!  You're a fucking hero!""

Apparently there are a lot more like us lurking out there.  They just haven't found their way out of the CA/pill popping/money grubbing/societal slavery closet yet.  

I post this as a cheers to all of us in this community.  We bash ourselves too much.  We're not worse people than the general population, and we're certainly not of lesser quality souls.  We are who we are, and apparently much to the respect, and I suspect envy, of others, we acknowledge our humanity.

I start talking to her (ohgeorge) about how I have a bunch of friends and San Francisco, and blah blah blah.  After a few hours of talking she says, ""Wouldn't it be funny if I just randomly bought you a ticket to San Francisco this weekend?""  Of course my answer was, ""Yes, it would be funny, and it would be awesome!""  5 minutes later I check my email, and there is a plane ticket confirmation notice, Portland to San Francisco!  This was about 6 AM Saturday morning.  I set my alarm for 9:30, and pass out.

Saturday morning I wake up at 10:30 (an hour after I was supposed to), and zombie walk my tired, hungover self to catch a train to the airport.  The whole time I was on the train I expected to get to the airport and not be able to check in, or not really have a ticket.  But sure enough, I get there, check in, and it's all legit.  I even got a free upgrade!

When I got to SFO I wasn't really sure what to expect.  Axe murder?  Rapist?  I don't know...  After some wandering around the airport I see ohgeorge with a sign with my name on it.  We say our hellos, and take the train into the city.  We met up with my friend to get some food and go to a bar.  It was about 3 PM at this point, and I'm still very hungover, and in need of some food.  We bought a few slices of pizza, and take it to the bar next door.  The bar is packed, and we end up having to share a table.  As we sit down, we realized we were sharing a table with one of my friend's best friend and his girlfriend.  We explained the situation, which they found hilarious, and thus our evening of complete randomness begins...

The five of us decided to go to a really classy bar at the top of a hotel.  We grab a few more classy drinks, and some more food, while enjoying an amazing view.  At this point we decided it was a perfect night for an ad-lib Bar Crawl.  Losing a few people, and gaining ohgeorge's friend, and then regaining the couple, we wind our way through San Francisco, hitting up classy hooker bars, dive bars, dance clubs, etc.  6 or 7 bars, and 10 hours later, after countless drinks, jokes, laughs, and random excursions up glass elevators and thru China Town arcades, we end our night half ass trying to dance, and lounging in a booth at a dive bar.

It was one of the most random, awesome, ridiculous experiences of my life, all thanks to ohgeorge and her awesome 5 AM drunk ideas!

Monday started like any other day, I rolled out of bed, grabbed a beer and decided on this glorious sunny day..I was going to get fucking retarded. 

Cut to bar número uno, friends place, kinda quiet but cheap beer. Drinking commences in earnest, he drinks water, I am disappointed.  A few pints later, I find myself 5 km away in another part of the city at some trendy faggy hipster bar. 

As I purchase an admittedly over-priced beer, I stumble across an old friend of mine who just so happens to work there. He has already had 5 pints, it is 1pm in the afternoon. We drink 5 or 6 beers..he seems a little drunk, he has to go set up a gig, I decide that I am now a very capable, experienced stage hand and I too, will do some sound engineering shit.

The gig: we enter some secluded courtyard, it is around 6pm. There is a grown man wearing golden glittery hot-pants. I find a seat whilst my buddy sets up the stage. I pass out. I am literally no help at all.

Suddenly, loud music, African drums, the golden glitter man is sat in a tree playing a xylophone, I am surrounded by a hundred odd people and there is a crazy naked old woman painted completely white dancing in some mud. I smoke a joint. 

The show ends, I am mesmerised, the weird naked woman rolled around on the floor and the human glitter ball is left in the tree idly waving his hands and wailing some nonsensical foreign bullshit. Everyone is mightily impressed, I am very stoned, it is time to leave. 

Back to the bar, more beer, more joints, vodka. The DJ asks if anyone can play drums and points to an African drum thing next to the booth. I step forward, I have become a musician. I play the drums for what seems like an eternity, I'm fairly certain I am shit. The clientele seem to like it, two drunken Russian men dance wildly around me and some girl repeatedly brings me shots of Jaegermeister. 

Not sure what happens next, grey goose and cranberry and some scotch?  I am stumbling to my friends apartment, I don't know where he lives, he doesn't seem to be able to remember either. He looks at me wild eyed and explains in a mixture of words and guttural grunts that we are drunk, stoned and lost.

We find a shop and buy more beer, I exit to find my friend is nowhere to be seen. Fuck. 

I wander the road for what seems like forever, I then realize I have walked past his apartment several times. I enter to find him rolling another joint. I sit on the floor with his dog and drink more beer. I lay next to the dog and pass out. 

Bright sunshine, I'm awake, there's a bit of weed left, I smoke it...I have no idea where I am. The dog looks at me, it gives me a look of a disdain, it's eyes bore into mine. This is some scooby doo shit and I am too hungover to figure out what is happening. 

2 hours later, my friend wakes me up..it's time to go home. He is sober enough to drive. Neither of us can remember how we got home or what happened. I have somehow spent the equivalent of 70 dollars.

Our story begins on a Friday evening. I'm an actor, so I have a show. It happens. Whatever. Fast forward to someone saying afterward they're having a house party with wine being the drink of choice. I don't usually drink wine - it's harder to get in PA and traditionally some really bad life decisions have been made under its influence. Fuck you though, it was free and I am broke. The party happens, I blow way past my memory threshold because I don't drink it enough to keep tabs on my limits.

I don't remember leaving that party (no, I didn't drive). My memory kicks in a few hours later in an unfamiliar bed having rowdy, dirty sex with this cute redhead who has been my love interest in several shows. She later told me I was so gone that she had to ask ME for consent first. Rock on.

We do the secks. She falls asleep. I explore her house (which I have never been to before) bare ass naked and finally find her bathroom and piss like a champ giggling to myself (yeah, giggling like a 12 year old at band camp who just touched his first boobie). Thus, I preserves her sheets and my dignity in the morning.

Wake up in the morning doing a naked cuddle with this chick, and we realize we've destroyed each others necks with dem hickies when we both have to teach children theatre at 10 in the morning. We cuddle some more, make out (actually a very sweet time) and then stumble a few blocks to the theatre and fist bump as we parted ways to teach.

1364293388.0	1b18mg	Let's talk about loss. Real loss.	myminisnameistwiggy	80	24	52	"Let's talk about loss like the title says. 

This comes off rather bitchy or cunty, I know. But fuck this 'sense of loss' so many people have. You lost your job. That is terrible, I'm sorry. You lost one relationship because your drinking and they were offended or what not by it. That sucks. Fine. I give you that.

But you want to talk real loss? Let's talk about the type of loss that keeps you awake at night with guilt. The loss you feel when someone you love or care about beyond belief goes away or dies. The loss you feel when you look at your childhood and realize the exact moment you were no longer a child. The exact moment you were aged 100 years overnight. The moment the child and the happy kid you were went away. 

The moment you had to be in the hospital hearing that your friend that purposely overdosed is dead. The moment the one you love that had been hurting you and abusing you in countless ways hurts you in the final way where you *finally* have the courage to leave. There is a tipping point. Everyone has one. Throughout my life I thought I've had my moments that were my tipping points. Every time I had one, it seems I got into another situation where I met a new tipping point. 

Endless cycles of abuse, hurt, pain, depression, anger, self-loathing, benders because you can't meet someone's needs, unable to help someone, unable to be all you need for the one you care about, feeling inadequate, unable to feel *normal* ever, et al. It's all the cycles. Endless cycles. You think you get out of one situation and think you can break that cycle. You sober up, you start taking care of yourself, you start feeling 'better', but then there's the trigger. There's always that trigger. You're reminded of the loss. 

There is pain and loss, then there's *grief.*

Grief at not just one's death and the sorrow that accompanies that. But the grief and loss you feel at realizing that what you were ages ago was killed. That person is dead. The happy kid? Gone. Too much self-realization is a dangerous thing.  I avoid doing the self-introspective thing because it gets me in a dark place. 

I've lost things. I've known joy. I've known love. But I know pain, as do many. I've known every emotion someone can have, as most of you have. But this false sense of loss a lot have because ""oh, my parents never agreed with me"" or ""oh, I lost this friendship"" is bullshit. You want real loss? Look at your past. Pinpoint the moment you stopped being *you.* Pinpoint the exact moment you were no longer the normal, healthy kid you were. The moment someone hurt you in such a way that you lost everything you ever were. You stopped being you. You stopped being the happy kid that would catch caterpillars and take care of them till they bloomed into butterflies and you started picking up substances or habits and seeking out something to make the pain stop; drugs, sex, alcohol, etc. 

Then when you *think* you've gotten over the loss? It comes back. It breaks a massive piece of you away when that loss occurs, yes. But throughout your life, this loss? It chips pieces away at you. You find yourself allowing people to chip away little pieces of what semblance of a person you were. 

Those five stages of grief we all know too well? They're not just about losing someone you love. It's about losing what you were. 

Denial.

Anger.

Bargaining. 

Depression. 

*Acceptance.*

But how do you get to acceptance? Are we ever going to get that? Do we ever reach that sense of acceptance? Is that why we can't stop the endless cycles of self-harm, self-loathing, addiction, etc.? What gives us acceptance? Are we never going to be able to reach that? Can I never find some sort of resolution or answer to this? Am I stuck in the first four steps forever? 

I know what it's like, as many do, to have life shit on you so much where all you want to do is sit on the couch and die with a bottle in your hand. I don't think being a 'crippled alcoholic' can be boiled down to anything specific in terms of definition. You'll find those here that have had an idyllic childhood and just enjoy being drunk all the time and have a physical dependence. Then there are those that have also felt this loss of not only one's self, but family, friends, etc. 

Are we ever going to be able to be happy again? When the cycles are endless and you're in so much pain all the time and so angry *all the time*?  When your own friends you see after a while tell you that you look like you've aged ten years since you've seen them. When your parents tell you that you don't look the same. When your brother tells you that you haven't been the same since he can't remember. When you look at yourself and can't understand why you're not the person you were anymore?

How do we find that happiness? How do we find that *acceptance* part of grief and loss? Can we ever? Or are we fucked forever because we're stuck in this cycle of polysubstance abuse, pain, regret, self-harm, etc.? What breaks these cycles? What helps us get over the loss? Can we ever? 

Look either way, fuck this false sense of loss so many feel. There's real pain we don't talk about. We don't talk about it for  a reason. Real pain is the stuff that actually keeps you awake at night. The things that wake you up in a panic attack sweating from a nightmare because you have flashbacks to things that have happened. Seeing someone's face in your dreams and being haunted. Fuck this false sense of loss. There is always going to be pain stemming from things that have happened in your life. I'm just saying, how do we get past the first for steps we feel from grief and loss and get to the last step of acceptance? Can we ever? 

I'm drunk and I don't know what else to say. I've ranted enough. I'm not re-reading this and I'm just going to post it before I get too self-conscious and delete this.

Cheers.

I've been working at an office for a little over a year. I was hired in at the same time as this girl--we'll call her Cuntface. Cuntface and I became good friends (or so I thought) during the past year, talking often outside of work via text and Facebook.

Recently I began to have sexual feelings toward Cuntface (and how could I not? She has a cunt for a face), and thought they may be mutual. A couple weeks ago, I told her this in no uncertain terms while we were chatting on Facebook and I was balls-deep into a half-gallon of Captain Morgan's. She grew ominously silent.

Last week at work she wouldn't even look at me, and I thought, ""Oh boy, this is awkward,"" but awkwardness I can handle. I mean, what self-respecting CA hasn't had to deal with that before. I tried texting her last weekend to say, ""Look, I get it. You're not interested. Let's not have this be awkward anymore,"" with no response. Still I thought little of it other than, “Huh. Well that kinda sucks.”

Then this morning, I looked at her activity log on the network for a completely unrelated reason and saw that she has had several meetings over several days with our director of ops. The only reason Cuntface would ever meet with the director is if something was wrong. And just like that, I knew: holy fucking shit, she's trying to get me fired.

All the gory details flooded into my head: I'm 32, she's 20; I'm in a supervisory position (though not over her), she's not; I'm a male, she's not; and my overt sexual overture is recorded on Facebook for eternity. My friends, if I would've had a fifth in front of me at that time, I would have literally chugged it in its entirety to calm the panic.

I went through most of the day in a cold sweat until finally I couldn't take it anymore. I cornered our director, and she and I had a sitdown in her office. She of course would neither confirm nor deny such a complaint had been made (though it was obvious she knew exactly what I was talking about), and made me feel a little better by being very interested to learn that no inappropriate correspondence had ever occurred in the office. Clearly, though, I'm still in fucking panic mode over here.

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent, fuckers. Time to numb my brain.

Wielded a gun towards the cashier?  Nope.  Walked into the liquor store on the way home, with the kid (perfectly legal in TX) and got thrown out...because...the kid had an ice cream cone.  The cashier jumped over the counter, grabbed me, and shouted, ""NO ICE CREAM IN THIS STORE! IT'LL RUIN OUR FLOORS!""

I mean, what was I supposed to do?  Fight?  I just laughed and said I'd go somewhere else.  Now you need to understand that where I live, liquor stores are few and far between, so I drove ten miles down the road to their parent store, bought my booze, and very politely asked to make sure the two stores were affiliated.  Told my story.  The manager came and was mortified.  I smiled, thanked him for his time, and drove home."	t5_2s68b	True

Then I hung out with some crazy homeless people in an alley, got drunk, begged for a bus ticket. Got to Ohgeorge's house somehow then we went to a bar, met some cool people and partied at some crazy 3 story mansion with a fucking pool in the living room. Then we walked a few miles back to her place. 

tl;dr being a mutha fuckin bum ain't so bad"	t5_2s68b	True
1375804356.0	1jtfp6	2 months. With pay.	throwawaytweet	58	6	28	"Well fuckers it happened. Got fired for the first time in my fucking life. I've been fucking up lately and Sunday night I damn near drank myself into a coma because I was dreading my work week so much. Needless to say I woke up an hour and a half late to work because of it.

I fucking hated that place and another year probably would've killed me. So fuck it. 

Most importantly fuck the HR guy. He's hated me since I've started and today was probably the best day of his life. Silver lining, I'll never need to talk to that fuck ever again.

Shit day over here for me, sorry for the rant. Fuck.

Cheers."	t5_2s68b	True
