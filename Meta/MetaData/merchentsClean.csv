I'm currently trying to gauge public opinion and desire, so if you're interested, please leave a comment. I can do pretty much anything for you, although I really do enjoy doing individual strain illustrations.

Small jars like you see in the other thread would run around $15, with the price scaling up as the size of the jar and illustration increases.

1332012000.0	r13v9	Can merchENTS start brainstorming for April in preparation for everyent's favorite 'holiday'?	licenseplate	24	3	13	"Hello MerchENTS and Merch enthusiasts!

We have a little over a month before 4/20, and I think it would be cool for MerchENTS to run a bunch of promos, coupon codes, and perhaps a contest or two?

What would ents like to see? Bundles? Contests? Just plain ol' discounts? Are any merchENTS planning something fun? 

I am releasing three new tee designs (One for each week of April leading up to 4/20), that is all I have planned at the moment.

I have hired ytknows, a css genius, to help me spruce up the subreddit:

* adding background image
* adding subreddit header image
* functionality to display coupon codes at the top of the subreddit (see below):
* ability to add store 'banners' in the sidebar

For the coupon codes, we can display individual ones (and just rotate them) but it might be better if we could synch up coupon codes so we can say something like, ""20% off all merchENTS stores with coupon code: 20TOKES""

I am also going to contact some reddit admins and see if I can't beg and plead a sidebar ad out of them to advertise this subreddit (targeted only to the /r/trees subreddit) for the upcoming month.

I'll start by saying that Sketchy Joe's will no longer be offering vaporizers, aside from the MFLB. The main reason for the change is because I want to refocus on glass and I don't have a lot of funds to work with right now.

That said, the quantity is limited and most of the prices are very close to what I paid wholesale.

[Silver Surfer GG](http://www.sketchyjoe.com/product/silver-surfer-ground-glass) (one left) ~~$269~~ $170 code: **ssv**

I am still accepting the code **frient** on the [MFLB](http://www.sketchyjoe.com/product/magic-flight-launch-box-full-kit) ~~$119~~ ~~$80~~ $90, I can no longer sell for any cheaper but I now offer a package deal for full purchase price ($119) that includes a space case grinder, extra batteries, an extra glass stem and free shipping.

Thank you for your continued support! The job market is tough for a new grad, but I've decided even if I still can't find anything I'm going to try my best to expand the store (and hopefully make it a little prettier). I hope some of you find these codes useful!

1341375058.0	w0kv8	Hey everyone! Any interest in getting custom glass work done?	GloriousMatt	24	3	21	"Hey folks, I'm looking into offering custom pieces at Sketchy Joe's and I was hoping to get some feedback from the community first.

The main plan is to bundle custom orders in with my orders to get wholesale prices with a very talented artist, then I'll pass on the savings. If for any reason the work didn't meet someone's expectations I'd offer a full refund. Even at near wholesale price, pieces can still be expensive. I'd estimate that a super heady slide would cost around $100 (as opposed to 150 elsewhere). Customers will always see a price estimate before the piece is made to avoid surprise bills.

The artist I have in mind is extremely talented and a popular glass blower on boromarket. He's often booked so the work could take as long as 2 months. His prices seem to be fair and he has two other glass blowers that can handle simpler requests.

I was just wondering how you all felt about the idea and if you had any suggestions or questions. I'm also curious about how long would be too long of a wait?

Thanks for all the support so far! Sorry about the wall of text!

TL;DR - Is there any interest in high quality custom glass orders?


EDIT: it sounds like there's a decent amount of interest, I'll make a new post this weekend to take orders and hopefully I'll be able to get some price quotes next week"	t5_2tdy5	True

1363039435.0	1a3vyq	Advice on starting a headshop	gilini	17	2	23	"Hey guys. I'm from Brazil, and were always annoyed by how we lack decent paraphernalia here. The few headshops we have usually only sell cheap ass glassware, and everyone I know that have a decent bong got it from some european shop.

So, I figured it's about time someone starts selling decent smoking paraphernalia around here.

My first concern is initial investment. I don't *know* people will buy expensive glassware here, but I got a pretty good hunch that there's enough people willing to pay extra for a good piece. So, in an ideal scenario, I'd start with some retailer(s) willing to drop-ship stuff for me. Since I started researching, I got convinced that finding someone willing to work with this model would be next to impossible. 

Therefore, I'll probably need to hold some inventory since the beginning, and that's OK. I also have a few grand I'd be willing to use to buy the starting stuff, and I can build the e-commerce myself (experienced web developer).

I've started researching for this about 2 weeks ago, and really didn't find much relevant information regarding wholesaling bongs, pipes and such. Trying to directly contact some big brands didn't even get me an answer.

Do you think I'd be able to find some retailer willing to drop-ship a few (less than 10) orders to me, just to test if there's a market to it? If I could prove this can work it would be much easier to justify borrowing money from the bank. Alternatively, if I could find someone willing to sell about 10 pieces in wholesale pricing that could work to test the business as well.

Alright, I feel like rambling here. Can anyone give me some advice? :)"	t5_2tdy5	True

the shirts cost me about $4 each, the paint about $8/can.

plus, making the stencils is takes around an hour.

and the first shirt for each stencil is usually botched. leading to more waste. :P

My thought is to have potential buyers post what they are willing to pay. From there, merchents could submit public or private bids. Say an Ent posts they are up to spend $100 - an Ent/Merchent could make a private or public bid for the Ent's offer.

Custom work is available, everything can be handled through Etsy to protect both parties.  Besides, Etsy is really cool to us so we want them to get theirs.

Tobacco use only, yadda yadda.  Please read our disclaimer/rules on each ad and understand it.

1327080469.0	op1ui	Ideas to become more of a merchENT family?	licenseplate	18	3	3	"Hey merchENTS (and ents in need of trees flair and who have disposable income!),

Let's think of some ideas that could help solidify ourselves as ent-run businesses working within the same /r/trees family :]

**Thoughts on a link swap?** Each of our sites could have a page with other merchENTS listed?

**Thoughts on coordinating coupon codes on occasion?** So that we can post something like, 'You can use the code: YAYCODE for 20% off on ANY order from ANY MerchENT!' It would probably encourage people to visit multiple stores when they are in a shopping mood.

**Thoughts on a sticker swap?** I already toss in a hemp wick sample from WhollyHemp when they have the time to send me some because it lets me support their business and (hopefully!) drive traffic to them. I know most of us have sitckers...maybe we can send each other little stickers to throw in with orders? (I know including them in EVERY order might be a little crazy, but maybe we can have a pricepoint where, once hit, you get a little 'sample' of other ent business stickers?)

**Coordinating our charitable giving**: I wonder if we could all agree on a set profit-percentage to donate to NORML (that seems to the most popular), and report in monthly to /r/trees? I wonder if NORML has one of those setups where you can be a 'fundraising team' and they list amounts on a webpage on their site. I think we definitely need to have more transparency from now on :)"	t5_2tdy5	True

Every year my family heads to the Ontario wilderness and says goodbye to television, internet, etc. for a month. It's awesome!


I just wanted to give everyone a heads up, since I won't be able to fulfill orders during this time. I will, however, be doing 'customer service' via E-Mail (I can check it about once a day) and taking a peek or two at this subreddit when I can.


My plan is to fill all my orders next week, check up on recent orders from international ents (make sure everyone got their stuff and send out replacements if necessary) and then put a big 'we'll be back!' landing page on the site.


So don't panic!


And if you have any merch requests while I'm gone, let me know! I'm going to be fleshing out designs for /r/trees [and other subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/radioreddit/comments/weqst/an_awesome_radioreddit_design_by_licenseplate/) so that I come back with fresh stuff for you guys.

1364868273.0	1bhiuz	A quick mod post regarding the sub	GloriousMatt	12	1	3	"Dear readers,

I figure since my business is on the back burner I can objectively be a 'bad' mod.

On the sidebar this sub is described as: 
&gt; a place for ents to promote their trees-related businesses, do a little shopping, and request future /r/trees merch!


Since it has grown most posts have steered away from the original idea of ent-run businesses to focusing on anything smoking related. While I do prefer people to choose 'local' businesses first, I don't see outside sites as a bad thing since we get to see and talk about what kinds of things you're looking for. I'm not going to go on a crazy deleting spree, but I am asking that you keep us in mind and not forget the original purpose of this place. Product requests, questions, product reviews (we'd love some product reviews!!) and anything else as related to running/interacting with a smoke related business or its products are welcome.


That said, anything very unrelated gets tossed! No hard feelings. This includes anything inflammatory. If there are problems with a business civil discussion is encouraged, but it's not really the place if it isn't a business that has a presence here or if the problem is resolved/in the process (unless you want to applaud great customer service).


Thank you for reading, I'm sorry it wasn't as quick as I intended. If anybody has any disagreements or anything to add please please do speak up.

Good night all,

Matt

The prices for the slides start at 60.00.  To give you an idea on price the hello kitty is $60 while the Mike is $100.  If you are interested in having a slide made please send an email to jake@brotherswithglass.com with the slide idea you want, I will reply back with a link to purchase the slide, if you like the price go ahead and purchase and the slide will be delivered within 2-3 weeks.  Right now we are working on having some really cool new slides made up and are always looking for ideas.  I am having some breaking bad themed, Wilfred and a few other shows that will be on the website in a few weeks.	t5_2tdy5	True

Toke on. 

Edit: So I went a little crazy and bought [this](http://www.puffitup.com/Titanium-Space-CaseSmall-4-Part-p/titanium%20spacecase4partsmall.htm), [this](http://www.puffitup.com/Natural-Pollen-Box-p/pollenboxnatural.htm), [and this.](http://www.puffitup.com/product-p/puffituppress.htm) Decided to hold off on the scale for now.

1352242793.0	12r9xk	Now taking orders for custom hemp bracelets!!! 	stratodude	11	1	3	"Hey Ents!

I'm opening a store! I make and sell hemp bracelets and necklaces. The way my store will work is I will take orders for hemp bracelets and ship the previous weeks orders every Monday. So say you PM me and order a bracelet or necklace on a Wednesday, I will ship it the following Monday. If you order on a Sunday, it will ship next day (Monday) and so on and so fourth. Shipping will always be $3.00.

**TO ORDER:**

PM ME!!! If you just leave a comment chances are I won't remember to make your bracelet! 

PM me what color you want (natural tan, brown, black, blue, or red. Or and combination of the two colors) Then, what style knot you would like, square knot, twist, or braid. If you would like beads in your bracelet, just tell me what you would like, I have round wooden beads, small purple stone beads, small turquoise beads as well as peace sign turquoise beads, small black metallic beads, round natural stones... If you want a certain type of bead chances are I can get it. You can order it without beads too. 

And last but not least, **YOUR WRIST SIZE** the average is 7.5"" but for a more accurate measurement use a felxable tape measure and measure the diameter of your wrist. Or take a piece of string and do the same, then measure that against a ruler. 

I hope to hear from my fellow Ents soon! Since I'm new here, this month I'll be running a **BUY ONE GET ONE FREE SPECIAL!** With your order, I'll include a bracelet free!

**All bracelets are $9.00**
Shipping is $3.00
I accept **PAYPAL!!**

Thanks!

[only item listed so far(imgur)](http://imgur.com/a/H24eS)

[etsy page](https://www.etsy.com/listing/150041497/biohazard-chemistry-stash-box)

I've got several others that I'll be re-listing in the coming days in the price range of $10-$20, mostly wood burned only, or minimal painting. 

I can also do image transfers, like my [personal Fallout stash box](http://imgur.com/a/v6mRP), another pic [here](http://i.imgur.com/4cykJTB.jpg) which is not for sale. I can make another just like it, but there are typically flaws in the transfer (It adds charm, I swear!) and must be black &amp; white. I can attempt photo transfers, but I won't guarantee results until I've had a chance to experiment. 

I can also do higher end boxes, but the amount of work that goes into them really jacks up the price. I spent over 50 hours on one of [these upper end stash boxes](http://imgur.com/a/hFE57) (the dragon), and around 20 hours on the other two.

I can do image transfers with paint over the design for a very cool effect. It isn't as labor intensive as a wood burned design, but is also not quite as permanent. It might only last 30 years as opposed to 60 years or so. :)

If you have a design in mind, contact me and we'll hash out the details.  There's never an obligation to buy. If you don't like it, don't sweat it. I'll likely sell it elsewhere."	t5_2tdy5	True

I'm selling an Atmos Raw knockoff that is identical in every way except that it has a LCD display screen that shows how much charge the battery has, whereas the Atmos Raw does not (so the one difference is a good thing).

Asking price is $75

I've had this thing for a while, but I've only used it a couple times.

It functions exactly as an Atmos Raw does, if not a bit better.

If you buy this, you will receive:

1x Assembled mouth piece (spring, metal screen, ceramic filter, rubber tip, casing)

1x ceramic heating chamber

1x battery

2x extra springs

1x cleaning brush

1x packing tool

1x owner manual

this is a great deal considering that the Atmos Raw is between $100 and $200, and this is literally the exact same thing.

thanks

I brought it to their attention, they screwed up a second time (Toby/MMMPINEAPPLE stating ""I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best""), but they fixed it.  It took some time, some discussion some reminding of promises, but he did what he said he would.

I got my merchandise today, just like Toby said I would.  While I am taken aback at the original issue, and the fact this did go on for three months (or more), we finally got it right, straight and correct.  It is awesome, well made, quality.

I will purchase from them, highly regard them as a great merchENT and am impressed with the fact they did do what they said they would.  Yes, it took time and was nearly a mess, but Toby did what he said he would, got things taken care of and I am happy.

Thank you Toby, thank you MMMPINEAPPLE and thank you ents for sticking around.  I know some of you hate me, some of you like me for sticking up for what's right...but mostly, I know that MMMPINEAPPLE will do what they say they will, you may have to remind him, and it may take time, but they did do what they said they would.
