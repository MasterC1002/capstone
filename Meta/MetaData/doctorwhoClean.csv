1374462600.0	1iseox	Over six months later, he's still talking about it. Parenting win.	cherieish	4168	1860	316	"My three-year-old son loves Doctor Who. He decided that the Doctor is the one who brings Christmas presents, not Santa. So of course, last Christmas, we decided to get him a sonic screwdriver ""from"" the Doctor, along with a letter saying that this was his very own sonic screwdriver, but he got a new one so he's giving this one to my son. He loved it.

A few weeks later, we went on vacation and the screwdriver got misplaced somewhere. We knew he'd be heartbroken, so we told him that the Doctor had borrowed his screwdriver back for a few days (while I ordered a new one from Amazon).

After it arrived, we waited until my son was in bed, placed the screwdriver with a note (""Thanks for letting me borrow it!"") outside his bedroom door, then played the TARDIS sound on my computer speakers. He came running out and found the screwdriver that ""the Doctor"" had ""brought back.""

So he asked the producer to change it:  
  
&gt;""It always bothered me,"" he explains. ""It struck me that 'the Doctor' was his name, whereas Doctor Who was the name of the show. He's not called 'Doctor Who'. His second name isn't 'Who.'""

&gt;""I talked to the producer. Obviously, I've got enough Asperger's syndrome kicking around that I had to get that particular box ticked. It wasn't contractual. I wasn't going to the wall on it. But I think I'm right in saying there are certain copies of the DVD boxset that have the old version. It's been corrected in the second pressing.  
  
And so, [boom!](http://i.imgur.com/sU11H53.png).  
  
What a guy. He was the hero Doctor Who deserved.

Years later when he went back to see the original statue with his son, there was no angel. 	seenahm	4025	1821	167	"“There was an abandoned church with a dangerous graveyard. Yes, dangerous. Officially dangerous. The gates were chained up and there was a big sign saying KEEP OUT DANGEROUS STRUCTURE. Well, could you have resisted? I went and peered through the bars. And there, among all the ancient leaning gravestones was the statue of lamenting angel. The way it looked at me, I felt sure this was the dangerous structure in question. A dangerous statue hidden in a graveyard! … 
A few Christmases later, long after Blink, we were back at the hotel. My son Joshua and I went for a walk past the church and it all came flooding back.
“Hey,” I said. “Want to see the original Weeping Angel? I took him to peer through the bars of the damaged graveyard. “Dad…..there’s no angel there”, There wasn’t. There really wasn’t. 
We left, fairly quickly”

1375637421.0	1josp2	Aug. 4th - Doctor Who Announcement Special Thread [SPOILERS]	jimmysilverrims	2466	851	2673	"THIS POST AND THE COMMENTS **WILL** CONTAIN SPOILERS. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO AVOID SPOILERS.


This will be a spoiler 'free for all' post. Comments do not need to be tagged with the (#s) spoiler code.  Read the comments at your own risk.

-----------------------

Instead of having post after post about every bit of info revealed during this Special, we have decided to make a Mega Thread. 

All discussion for the event on Sunday should take place here. 

If you are hearing about this Special for the first time now and do not mind big spoilers, read [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/The-Next-Doctor-will-be-revealed-on-Sunday-04-August) to learn what the special is about.

It will air at 7:00 pm BST, 2:00 pm EST. *The show will be simulcast live on BBC America.*

**New posts about this special will be removed** so we don't have clutter all about the same thing. The mods will be removing both links and self posts about the casting news during the day but will go back to the normal routine late Sunday/Monday. 

If the amount of new posts about this event gets out of hand, the mods might disable posting for a short time. This will only effect new threads, it will not prevent people from commenting, and would only last until the influx dies down.

Please note that going back to the normal routine means **'No Spoilers in Titles'**. If you want to discuss the casting news, do not put that directly in your title or the post will be removed. ""Why I disagree with the recent casting news"" is perfectly fine, ""Why I love that Actor-So-and-So is the new Doctor"" is not.

I've posted this before, but I want to make sure enough people see this so I get a good representation of all 60k of you (only 50 responses so far). This is not a school project; this is simply from my own curiosity. I will post results by next Friday. Again, please upvote so we can get it as much exposure as possible. 

[Survey Link](http://kwiksurveys.com/?s=MLJMII_3d57a6eb)

***You can go back and fix your answers at any time!* But please try to fill it out completely. I am not going to count partial forms.**

Please keep an eye on this post so you know when there are changes.

If you have any suggestions for me, message me and I will add them. 

Also, if the mods want to put this in the sidebar, I'll add a link for results that I can update regularly.

EDITS: ~~Wales and Northern Ireland are added to the list of countries, third gender option is now available. 
Countries temporarily bugged. Will be back up soon.
Countries are back up, although I'm expecting very skewed numbers after this mishap.~~ 

Other box added for companions. Will compile when I do results. 

It was suggested for me to add favorite villains. Give me a decent range of ideas. Preferably a good selection of pre-9 villains. Also, favorite alien/species.

More companions added to the list.

***Big Update:* Villains added.**

Started Compiling Results. Most impressive country award goes to [Sint Eustatius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint_Eustatius) which has a population less than 4,000. Keep 'em coming though. Hopefully I'll be setting up a site where you can update your answers and see periodically updated results.

Slight Kerfluffle: Cleared the current entries (meant to just clear the text responses), so if you've filled it out, **please don't fill it out again UNLESS you didn't finish filling it out previously.** However, if the numbers spike back up, I will just put the new numbers in rather than add the numbers to what I have compiled. (Technically finished compiling the first ~6000 responses.)"	t5_2qhek	True

Clara is the reason the TARDIS explodes. How? No idea. But during the Big Bang River says that someone else is flying the TARDIS. Who that was has yet to be answered. There are other control rooms that can be used to control the TARDIS. She could have learned this in the upcoming episode where they explore the TARDIS.

On top of that, because Clara was in the TARDIS when it explodes and when The Doctor reboots the Universe, she does not reboot correctly. Multiple versions of her are created through out space and time.

Update - Thanks to TEM_GuildMaster, I'm thinking it was the GI who was flying the TARDIS when it exploded.  The first episode that Niel Gaiman wrote, The Doctors Wife, House was meant to be the GI, but got written out.  Which shows that the GI may be able to take over the TARDIS matrix.  So Clara may have blown up the TARDIS to defeat the GI."	t5_2qhek	True
