After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and G is out flat. F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough. A D comes in and heads for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second."" Then A comes in, but the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor. 

Then the bartender notices B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and says, ""Get out! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight."" E-Flat comes back the next night in a three-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender says, ""you're looking sharp tonight. Come on in, this could be a major development."" Sure enough, E-flat soon takes off his suit and everything else, and is au natural. Eventually, C, who had passed out under the bar the night before, begins to sober up and realizes in horror that he's under a rest. So, C goes to trial, is convicted of contributing to the diminution of a minor and sentenced to 10 years of DS without Coda at an up scale correctional facility. The conviction is overturned on appeal, however, and C is found innocent of any wrongdoing, even accidental, and that all accusations to the contrary are bassless. The bartender decides, however, that since he's only had tenor so patrons, the soprano out in the bathroom and everything has become alto much treble, he needs a rest and closes the bar."	t5_2qnw8	True

That's right, we've got uber-beginner to intermediate to advanced; traditional, contemporary, holiday classics, pop, jazz, and even classical. Most of it's free, but there are a few $2-$5 sheets that are worth it as well. Hopefully there's something for everyone here to learn over the holidays for your own enjoyment, for impressing family &amp; friends, and for sharing with the /r/piano community!

Please post any other favourite arrangments you know of in the comments. This is a list-in-progress that I'll probably update throughout the month.

We'll use this list for Piano Jam #12. If you're not yet familiar with the /r/piano monthly Piano Jam, just refer to all the details in the [previous piano jam](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/12jl4m/piano_jam_11_november/).

1357555647.0	1644x9	I tuned my first piano yesteday for a friend, here is my braindump...	7Geordi	77	5	24	"TL;DR: You should tune a piano sometime, you will get a lot out of it. Just pick one you don't care deeply about to start with.

A friend asked me to tune her piano in exchange for food and company because she could not afford to have her piano tuned professionally. I conceded! The instrument was a Young Chang U 121, a black lacquered upright with a slightly metallic tone.

Here's what I knew going in:

* Tuning a piano is very hard.
* One of my piano teachers was also a piano tuner and would tune my family's baby grand from time to time. He took the liberty of teaching me how to tune it. His approach was mostly based on listening. He would use a tone generator to tune the central three octave, then tune the rest purely by ear. Primarily focusing on volume fluctuation caused by interference.
* I would need a tuning hammer, a couple rubber wedges, and a tuner. Sadly I was not able to get my hands on a tone generator, but the tuner I had was quite good and I decided to risk it.
* The pegs are seated in ~~cork~~ laminated wood (*thank you iamaturtle*) or a similar substance and are held in place by friction (not mechanically like on a guitar), meaning many adjustments is bad for the piano in the long term.

Here's what I learned:

* Tuning a piano is much much harder than ""very hard""
* Tuning a piano takes a long fucking time, especially when you are inexperienced. My total time with the instrument before I was ""done"" was 8 hours in two installments, and I put done in quotes because I had tuned every note as well as I could and was totally fucking exhausted, but the damn thing still didn't sound as good as I wanted everywhere.
* Tuning a piano is probably the greatest listening exercise I have ever done. Between trying to find the interference patterns on low notes, to trying to separate the high notes form one-and-other my ear and temporal lobe got a great workout.
* At first I tried to tune each string in a triplet independently, and then tried to bring them together, but the margin of error on the tuner was so large that I ended up doing twice as much work. The strategy I settled on was spending a long time with the first string to get it just right, and then tuning the other two against it by ear alone.
* Tuning the middle octaves with help and then working outwards by ear was untenable, my ear just wasn't experienced enough to tune octaves apart reliably, and often when I checked my work with the tuner I would find that I was sharp going up, and flat going down. So I ended up doing the best I could by ear as an exercise and then just using the tuner anyway... that is, until the tuner could no longer hear the note I was playing (this happened two octaves from the top and one octave from the bottom). Then I ended up really doubling down with the listening.
* Tuning the high strings was crazy hard. Once you're in the undamped zone, you get sympathetic resonance from the octave above, except that you haven't tuned it yet so it's just fucking with you. I ended up stuffing a scarf against the upper strings so they wouldn't confuse me. Also every note near the note I was playing would lightly vibrate as well, so I often found myself trying to pick out one tone among seven or eight similar tones. When tuning the second and third chord in a triplet, interference was completely indistinguishable, but thankfully I noticed that when they are in tune, the note suddenly gets significantly louder. This was the key observation that saved me, and at the end, the last octave actually sounded quite decent.
* Tuning the low strings was merely hard. My ear could not distinguish their pitch very quickly, and comparing to the octave above was tough. Interference was there, but it became distinguishable late in the falloff, and I often didn't have enough time to make it go away.
* Tuning the middle strings was hard - mostly because the damn things just didn't want to change pitch. Also because I started with the middle, and didn't really know what the fuck I was doing yet.
* The pegs in each region responded very differently. I found the high-note pegs to be very responsive, just a soft push or pull on the end of the hammer would make an immediate and noticeable change. The middle pegs were little assholes; they were hard to adjust and frequently went back to what they were doing before just to spite me. The low pegs I could liken to donkeys, I would have to push well past the change I wanted to make before they settled back somewhere between where they started and where I wanted them to be.
* A big surprise was that strings seemed to keep their new tone much more reliably if I over-tightened slightly and then relaxed them to where I wanted them. This concerned me, because it meant more wiggling than is theoretically necessary, but it really cut down my time-per-string significantly. A surprise because when tuning my bass guitar exactly the opposite is true; it will keep its notes better if I tune up from below.
* When tuning the top notes by ear, start three octaves down and play the same note ascending each octave (e.g. tuning C7: play C4, C5, C6, C7). I found I felt much more confident in my pitch comparisons than if I had just played one octave below.
* I played many chords over the tuned region as I worked; this was both extremely disheartening, and helped me identify problem notes to return to. I decided early on that I would not revisit notes until the end UNLESS they were fucking up tuning other notes.

The end result was entirely playable. My friend was actually very pleased and could not tell that some of the notes were a bit of a tragedy still. That said she is somewhat tone-deaf. When I played the piano after I finished, I found that the sustains of the notes seemed short, and with the case still open I felt that the instrument's tone was very metallic and bright. But it was midnight and I could not work on it any longer, so I closed it up and played a few more songs. It actually sounded pretty decent, it was clear that the first few octaves I did were less well done than the later ones, so I definitely learned something!"	t5_2qnw8	True

Listisa is known for engaging with her fans on her social media webpages- maybe she'd be interested in doing an AMA here?

Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place or I'm going about it wrong, but I don't really know how it'd happen.

It's based on the [song here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCQoBwjt7vM), which is from [this r/piano post](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/l4ugv/can_anyone_find_the_sheetmusic_for_this_there_is/).


Have you ever wondered how pianists come up with beautiful renditions like the one above, without any sheet music? Do you have the chords and melody for some song, but don't know how to put them together to make it move and flow nicely? Hopefully this helps.


**The tutorial PDF is here:**
~~http://www.scribd.com/doc/68929185/Playing-Pop-Ballads~~  *Edit: better link:* http://minus.com/mlU9yZNmx (download it to view all 7 pages)


**The corresponding audio playback of the examples is here**:
http://soundcloud.com/pianoboy-reddit/playingpopballads  (sorry for the poor midi playback)


This does assume you can read sheet music and can play basic chords. I tried to avoid theory concepts as much as possible.

I put this together because there are a lot of posts on r/piano linking to songs that are played in this type of style, and so I thought it might help some people understand how they're constructed and played.

Anyway if you have any questions or thoughts, let me know in the comments!"	t5_2qnw8	True

Woohoo! Ready for our first Piano Jam?!! 

A brief description in case you don't know what this is about: Each month we will be selecting some piano pieces and improv/arrangement/composition ideas for people to work on and share with the community. The idea started [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/nzt6n/reddit_piano_jams/), following what /r/classicalguitar is doing, and more ideas were gathered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/o1dk9/rpiano_piano_jam_kickoff/). 

Thanks to everyone for all their great suggestions! I tried to pick a good mix of composers/styles/tempos/difficulties from the suggestions, and generally went with shorter pieces (except Medtner -- good luck!) since we're getting started late this month. As always, feel free to do something that's not on the list. Lots of the good suggestions can be saved for future months, too.

BeowulfShaeffer	51	10	27	"This may be obvious to a lot of you on r/piano but I had a ""modal epiphany"" over the weekend and I wanted to share. (Full disclosure - credit to my instructor for really prompting this ""Eureka"" moment). 

I have ""intellectually"" understood modes for a long time (""D Dorian is just the notes of C played from D to D"") but it's only been in the last week that it really clicked for me how to *use* them and my improv playing sounds noticeably better (to me at least) as a result.
  
The key insight for me is that the best way to think of a mode is as a scale of **thirds** (i.e. a giant chord) and NOT as a diatonic sequence.  So, for example, take C Dorian mode: it has a flatted 3rd and 7th. The way you'll usually see this discussed is to ""play the notes from the Bb scale, but starting on C"", so: C,D,Eb, F, G, A, Bb, C. This is not very useful to a piano player.  Run up and down that scale sounds...pretty crap, honestly. Not at all obvious why that scale is significant.
  
Ah, but the REAL gem is to think of the scale this way:

  C-Eb-G-Bb-D-F-A-C
  
Same notes, just spread out. You've got a Cm7 in the right hand and a Dm or Dm7 in the RH.

This is an extended chord sure but try thinking of THIS sequence of notes as the scale to noodle on. This will keep you from clashing.  For instance, play that Cm7 in the LH (C-Eb-G-Bb). somewhere around middle C. Now play a little run in the next octave up that goes C-Eb-G-A.  The A will go ""CLUNK"" because A doesn't work as a 6th - it needs some distance from C to sound like pleasant color. If you play the RH scale in a way that incorporates ""D-F-A"" it will sound really nice and ""intriguing"".
  
It gets better.  To flip to, say, Phrygian mode you need to additionally flat 2 and 6.  That only is a right-hand change:
  
  C-Eb-G-Bb-Db-F-Ab-C
  
Try going back and forth between the two.  Play Cm7 in the LH and run up the first scale and down the second - it's a pretty easy change because from a fingering point of view you're changing the RH from a D minor to a Db major.  There's a really cool shift of tonality.  If you were sitting in a Cm7 you could alternate between these two scales and get some interesting sounds. 
  
So my experience is - if you ""picture"" the mode as an extended chord rather than a ""shifted diatonic sequence"" it's easier to picture and more importantly easy to use.  You'll get bored playing only chord tones, so once you start to get these under your fingers you can start bringing in more diatonic or chromatic runs using the notes from whatever mode, but if you learn the modal scales in thirds you'll immediately be able to apply them.

I never properly learned to read keys, but my love for music and the melodies of the piano remained.

Yesterday, doing a major cleaning up of the whole house, I found the synth. It still works perfectly. I sat down and it was like I found an old friend after a long, long time. I played some long-forgotten tune (the main Secret of Mana theme) on the first try and it was like watching someone else's hands playing. All the instruments I remembered were there and I almost cried when I heard the oh-so familiar sounds of the harpsichord, the elec piano, the jazz organ, the clarinet.

After 2 hours of being totally lost among the keys, I got the first half of [Yann Tiersen - La Dispute](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0hbrcyHTCI) from Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain down. Before going to sleep I decided that I will take up learning again, I will find a teacher and I will learn to play the piano like I forgot I always wanted.

Today, the realization just made my day golden. I am still so happy at the mere thought that I had to share (and of course subscribe to r/piano).  Thanks for reading:)"	t5_2qnw8	True

OK, these things have their importance, but if you want to improvise inventing music on the spur of the moment with emotional expressions, then you have to add important other concepts.

Well I'm a beginning pianist, but I have a lot of time to practice this week so I really want to get a couple of songs started.

I've done a search of this reddit for some ideas of what to play but unfortunately there's usually only a couple of posts and they're all at different levels.

So can we please just get one nice list of songs (possibly for the sidebar?) you think would be good for beginners to learn? It might also be nice to contribute some of your favourite pieces that others mightn't know about, no matter how difficult, but I'll leave that up to you guys.

So here are a few pieces I've found that I want to progress from.

[*Minuet* by Bach](http://www.8notes.com/scores/2402.asp?view=full&amp;ftype=gif)

[*'Spring' from the Four Seasons* by Vivaldi](http://www.8notes.com/scores/440.asp?view=full&amp;ftype=gif)

[*Greensleeves*](http://8notes.com/scores/7238.asp?ftype=gif)

Though I'm having a bit of a problem getting my rhythm down with my left hand on Greensleeves. That said, I should be able to do it in the not too distant future.

As you can see, these are the kind of songs I think of beginners, as opposed to [*comptine d'un autre été*](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/ij37o/good_pieces_for_a_beginner/c245kej), no offence aramadia, it's a fantastic piece which I really want to learn.

Cheers

And when she pointed at a specific measure to play, I had to play from the very start just to get to that point, and remember what notes I'm meant to be hitting. Part of the problem is, I'm playing by memory (remembering measure-by-measure), but I'm slowly learning to sight read. Anyway, that's beside the point! GUHHHh...

This song gets posted about twice a month to r/piano, so I thought I'd transcribe the full thing to help those trying to learn it, or for those just curious about some of the chords he's playing.

Bon Iver's Performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3VjaCy5gck

Transcription: http://minus.com/mvnsthKSz

I kept the transcription fairly close to what he's playing and how he's playing it (instead of simplifying it) and so a few warnings:

* If you have small hands like me and can't reach an interval of a 10th in your left hand, you probably can't play measures 6-13 exactly as written. Those of us that can't reach those nice 10ths have to use our right hands where possible, roll the chords, or cheat (curse you small hands!). For example, in measure 6: instead of an F,C,A in left hand, maybe start with F,C,F, hold the pedal, and hit the next A in the left-hand when it comes up. On the next Am11 chord, play the B with your right hand (i.e. right hand is B,C,D, G, and left hand is just A,E). In measure 8, play both G's with the right hand. In measure 9, maybe ignore the first F in the left hand but hit the 2nd one, like with measure 6. In measure 13, you can reach the F with your right hand (F and C), etc.

* If you're trying to learn this note for note, it will be difficult - that's the problem with a precise transcription. Instead, try to learn the chord structure and just use this as a guide and add your own style. It will be much easier, and probably sound better too!

* You can see this doesn't work well as a solo piano piece ""as is"", because it's really a piano accompaniment (e.g. he doesn't play the melody since he's singing it). It would be a good learning exercise to try to throw in a simple melody in the right hand to turn it into a piano solo piece.

I'm going to try and introduce a topic every week for us to discuss.  Feel free to send me ideas for future topics.  You are always welcome to post your own throughout the week! Please upvote the topic for visibility.*

We hit on an [interesting discussion about scale practice routines](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1b4qfd/practicing_scales_through_mirror_playing_and/) this week, but I would like to go deeper.

Questions to help fuel the discussion and get everyone thinking:

* How do you plan out your practice for the day/week/month?
* How do you get everything done that you need to?  The world of music is massive, so how do you organize all of the information?
* How do you stay on track and make sure you're ""practicing"" and not just ""playing.""
* Do you practice things in all twelve keys?
* Do you practice very slow and very fast?
* Do you work on one piece at a time or do you work on multiple pieces? How many?
* Do you practice improvisation? How?
* Do you work on memorization? How?
* Do you spend time learning about music theory?
* How much time do you set aside every day for practice?
* What are your long term goals?

April is [Jazz Appreciation Month](http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/) in the US, so we thought the piano jam would focus on a few choice jazz standards.

Thanks goes to OnaZ for both the idea and for picking all of the tunes. I just helped find a few links.

Due to the flexible nature of jazz, we might get all sorts of arrangements this month.  See what you can do with the lead sheets provided.

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces each month covering different skill levels and styles, but you are free to pick a different piece. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! 

**Guidelines:**

* You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. Please put ""[Piano Jam]"" somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for.

* Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability.

* You do not have to complete pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the community!

* Remember: You are always welcome to choose something else not in the list to work on and share with everyone!

1358958739.0	174n4h	A simple trick for pentatonic scales...	BeowulfShaeffer	35	7	11	"Every book I've ever looked at that talked about the Pentatonic Scale describes as ""three notes, then two"". IOW, in the key of C, it's ""CDE GA"".  Play it that way and it sounds sorta dull.
  
My instructor last night pointed something out that I hadn't noticed.  Rearrange it like this:  ""ACD  EG(A)"".  The point of this being that here you can see that is the same figure twice - a minor third and a major second.  Try playing in the LH ""ACD, E(below A) GA"" and it will sound like some kind of 70s funk bassline. 

That little trick immediately made it easier for me to ""see"" the pentatonic in other keys. My instructor is showing me how when you play blues you can choose the play a pentatonic based on the root, third, fifth or seventh with different ""blue"" notes resulting.  This can provide a lot more color than just always playing C blues scale over C7, F blues scale over F7, etc. etc. 

Anyway just wanted to mention the trick because I'd never seen it before. My teacher is full of these kinds of little tricks."	t5_2qnw8	True

Within the past couple days my carpal tunnel has been acting up again, for the first time in a while (too much courante-ing, get it? no? OK..). 

My question is this. I've amassed a fairly large repertoire and am stuck with finding slow, non physically-demanding pieces for me to practice until this goes away.
 
I can find slow pieces anywhere but what I was hoping you might be of some help with is finding pieces that will stress my technique, while still not stressing my wrists in this condition. What are examples of pieces like this? Liszt, Consolations I, most Bach chorales, Brahms later solo piano compositions, etc. Pieces that are simple, but that you can play for a lifetime and still find things to interpret differently, you get the picture.

Thanks, and any and all help is appreciated!

P.S. No Debussy please, his orchestral compositions are great but...no piano. Maybe it's having to teach every little kid saying ""I wanna play Debussy now"" that has ruined it, but I really have a unabated disdain for his solo piano works. "	t5_2qnw8	True

BeowulfShaeffer	37	7	4	"I've never considered myself a very good pianist and truly I am not (somwhere between a 5th year and an eighth year I think) but I have been working a lot the last year trying to improve.  I've *never* played in any kind of band but my co-worker just got a new piano and invited me over to check it out the next time his band got together.
  
So I went over with a bit of trepidation as I had no idea what I might be stepping into. I sat down to play and shortly my co-worker was like ""Dude! You said you play a little piano, not that you rocked that shit!"".  I was like ""thanks for the compliment but trust me I'm not very good"".  Truly though, I did seem to have a stronger grasp of theory than anyone else there and my playing was adequate if not stellar (IMO).  My  host turns out to a phenomenally awesome drummer and we had a really fun jam where I just wailed on some bluesy jazzy stuff while he played some amazing percussion.  We just jelled - consider I have always considered rhythm to be my weaker side I was amazed how we did some stacatto interchange stuff that just worked the first time. It was exhilirating.
  
Later on my host pulled me aside and said ""You really need to consider the possibility that you are better than you think.  I know when you're practicing it just sounds like the same old shit to you but you're actually pretty damn good.""  
  
So keep practicing, r/piano.  Someday someone will say the same to you and with any luck you won't have to wait till you're as old as I am to hear it.

[Here is a SUMMARY of the results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m66TGdGhfVcSasCf7nBgb0xrm6fmff19xchDnhEXVNQ/viewanalytics).

Pianoboy and I have been looking at the feedback and here are a few **goals we have going forward**:

* **Start a weekly piano-related discussion and encourage more discussions in general.**  (You can all help by **upvoting discussions!**)

* **Be more active in moderation**.  We will be: closing more posts (while directing those posters to other sources of information), more strict with loosely piano-related content, more active in limiting spammers, restrict image memes, eliminate duplicate questions, etc.

* **Update and expand the FAQ**.  People seem to like the FAQ, but feel that its information can be limited.  The FAQ is pretty much my personal project (with help from pianoboy), so I have days where I furiously update it and then it might go a month or two without a change.  I'll try to be more active with it.

* **Figure out some way to organize sheet music requests**. We will probably be directing more people to /r/transcribe and /r/MusicNotes in the future as well as distancing ourselves from Synthesia/tutorial requests. We're going to add another section to the FAQ about sheet music and keep building up the new [repertoire section](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/wiki/faq#wiki_repertoire).

We found that people come to /r/piano for many different reasons, so above all **we have to trust the upvote/downvote system** more than anything else to see what kind of content you all are interested in.  Most of you want to see more discussions, so **remember to upvote discussions!**

Thanks for being a great community.  Feedback is always welcome.  Now why are you still reading this?  Go practice!

I'm 27, and I'm recently getting back into taking piano seriously, taking lessons and everything, practicing an hour or two a day.

I used to play piano a lot more when I was a teenager, but I decided not to major in music when I entered college for financial reasons and am wondering if I will be able to ""make up the years I missed"" since I didn't go to school for music or anything.  I was never superbly awesome, but I was good enough to at least be able to play through Beethoven's Moonlight (all 3 movements) and not suck too much.

I work 9-5 full time, and am concerned that I won't have enough time to practice to become good enough to play some Chopin or Liszt Etudes, and at the very least sound like I could be a concert pianist, haha.

I'm concerned that since I'm older, I might not learn as well as I could have when I was younger, or that I won't have the time to devote to it, or that since I missed out on a super formal music education that there's no way I'll be able to get the experience I need since well, I need to pay for bills and work 40 hours a week, etc.

Any ideas?

**Edit: Thanks for all the support so far!  It's also really reassuring to hear that some of you have been discouraged by similar things that I have been...Glad to know I'm not crazy.  I'll try to post a piano video by the end of the year with some progress, or something.  :)**"	t5_2qnw8	True

1346424229.0	z4xxe	Need advice:  kids hate practicing piano	snowbird122	38	8	85	"TLDR:  Should I force my kids to stay in piano lessons?

Long version:  I have a 10 year old daughter and a 7 year old son.  They both started piano lessons around age 4 or 5.  I play well enough to stay ahead of the 10 year old pretty easily.  They both take lessons from the same lady, and I took lessons from her for about 18 months too.

Everybody always says ""I wish my parents had made me stay with piano"".  I decided to be that parent.  It is getting harder and harder, especially with my 10 year old.  These lessons are very low pressure, but my 10 year old is to the point now of making almost no progress for 6 weeks.  We're all very frustrated.  She just does not like practicing, and honestly, she has a tendency to be lazy with everything (schoolwork, chores...).  Should I redouble my efforts to get her to practice better, or throw in the towel?

I don't believe the problem is the teacher.  I believe it is the students (and possibly the parent) :)

If they weren't practicing piano, they would probably use that time to watch more TV and play more video games.

* Logistics: Timeline, Piece Selection, Submissions
* Request for January pieces
* Next Steps

**\*\*UPDATE -- January Jam has been posted \*\***

---

**Welcome**

Hello Everyone! After talking with a few people, I thought I'd just get this thing rolling so it doesn't die out before it has a chance to start. I know OrigamiTrail, nate8968, and others are willing to help out, which is great! I really want this to succeed, so I'm always open to suggestions and modifying how this is run, and I'm committed to keeping this idea active and continuing each month. Please read everything below and then participate in helping to select pieces for January and fine tuning our process with your feedback.

---

Logistics

---

**Timeline**

* A few days before the end of each month, I'll post a final call for submissions for the month and a request for selections/ideas for the next month.

* At the beginning of the new month, I'll post the selections for the new month and a summary of all the results from the previous month, just like how they do in r/classicalguitar 

---

**Piece Selection**

* We'll start with ~~Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced categories (See the vote thread in the comments section for extending this)~~ 
 **Edit: 1) No specific categories. Suggest any piece, but take a guess at the relative difficulty level.
             2) Suggest pieces in any style (e.g. jazz, blues), following guidelines below (i.e. public domain sheet music or do-able with a chord-chart).
             3) Suggest improv/composition challenge ideas, etc. Anything goes; I'll organize it later.**

* We won't limit pieces to classical music, but expect it to be weighted more towards this since the majority of easily accessible public domain music falls into this category.

* I'll request piece selections from the community and rely on votes &amp; comments (and my good judgment? ha!) for finalizing the choices -- but in a timely manner. We may want themes for certain months, and we may want designated people to select pieces if we're comfortable with that, especially if we're not getting many suggestions. I'm willing to move to whatever approach will work best.

* We may have ~2 selected pieces per difficulty level for variety. Again, we'll see what works best.

* We'll always welcome people to work on any piece of their choice outside of the suggested options. I don't want this to die out because people don't like the selections. The goal is to get people involved in learning music and for them to be able to share their successes with us.

* Legality - we'll start off trying to keep things as ""legal"" as possible, like r/classicalguitar is doing. This means trying to avoid pirated sheet music :)... which means using public domain sheet music from good resources like [imslp](http://imslp.org/wiki/) or from the composer's site if they release their scores to the public.  
    Note: If we do end up doing some sort of improv category, this probably means using chord charts for most modern pieces, as there's no copyright issues with chord charts. I know that performances of non-public-domain pieces is in a legal gray area, but I see this venture as more of an educational thing (learning a piece and receiving feedback) than a performance, so I'm okay with it. If there are concerns over this we could tweak the requirements.

[**New:**] Compositions - We'll encourage original compositions to be submitted. Again, we may have ""themes"" or specific compositional ideas to focus on, but any composition will always be appreciated. **[/new]**

---

**Submissions**

* You are encouraged to post your submission as a separate post to r/piano anytime during the month. Please put ""[Piano Jam]"" somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for (and so I don't miss it).

* OR, you can wait until the final call for submissions near the end of the month and post your submission in the comments of that thread.

* Please try to use YouTube or SoundClound for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and successes with the community!

* Again, you are free to work on any song of your choice (i.e. you're not limited to the posted selections).

---

**Request for January Pieces**

* Please post your recommended selections for this month in the comments below, ideally one piece per comment. For best results, please provide a link to the sheet music (e.g. [imslp](http://imslp.org/wiki/) and a performance of the piece (youtube). See my example in the comments.

* Vote on your favorite piece suggestions, add any comments, etc.

* There is no overall ""theme"" for January - anything goes.

---

**Next Steps**

* Remember to suggest pieces for January in the comments, vote on them, and provide any other suggestions.

* In 1 to 2 days I will create our January Piano Jam post with the selections for this month, and we'll be on our way!

* Always feel free to comment or PM me with suggestions, let me know if I'm doing a crappy job, etc. :)

My absolute favorite 'romantic composition' of all time...is:

[Charles-Valentin Alkan -- Symphony for solo piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Z5P1gAjyE)

It has gotten me through and contributed to many depressive episodes in my life!

Little bit of information about myself - I was born into a musical family where my dad is a DMA out of UMichigan and my mom a concerto pianist out of China. Needless to say I was brought up in a very musically competitive environment. I grew up to win multiple awards and have played at places such as Carnegie Hall while I was in High School.

Here's some of my previous performances (all of which done sophomore year in high school)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VJpciouQdg

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWHNtNtm8h0

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1rxcvO_1l4

I have since gone out of the serious piano scene after college, but was wondering the other night - I should  start up a video blog aimed at the beginner or intermediate crowd. This is the crowd that is maybe OK at reading music but needs help interpreting it, or needs that extra little exercise to bring their finger dexterity to play that Prokofiev they've always wanted to play.

My videos would probably be 5-10 minutes long each, updated biweekly or weeky. Areas of interest would be:

Beginner:

* Form - how to start to play the piano correctly, so injury doesn't occur. Also a lot of people overlook the fact that without correct form the piano skillset is drastically diminished.

* Basic music theory - major/minor scales, how to read staff, basic chord progressions, etc

* Finger exercises - Hanon, scales, arpeggios, etc

* Simple song transcriptions - would probably be popular among the folks that ""just wanna play that Beyonce tune"".

Intermediate:

* Finger dexterity - I didn't put this in finger exercises because it focuses more on the type of sound you get with different ways to press the keys

* Interpreting musical passages - taking standard repertoire and dissecting certain parts. This part I'm flexible on because I can take suggestions from viewers.  I will probably include pieces like certain Chopin Etudes, Mozart sonatas, Bach preludes/fugues, maybe even some modern pieces such as Prokofiev sonatas or Liszt Transcendental Etudes (more advanced). New age stuff like Phillip Glass and Steven Cravis would also work but less challenging.. 

* Composers, musical eras and how that relates to interpretation of their pieces.

* Memorization tips - different theories into how to memorize music &amp; when to do it.

* Other general tips that I think up as I go along.

So, here's the question: Most pianists would rather learn to play popular songs instead of classical. Would this blog really benefit a large audience?  I'm excited but I'm on a high horse right now and possibly I need to be brought down to reality and reminded that maybe this idea goes outside of the general population's motives. My goal for this project is to have a supplement to formal piano instruction.

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces and other ideas for each month, but you are free to submit anything. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines at the bottom of this post.

This month has some more 20th century pieces thrown in, including a difficult short prelude by some guy I've never heard of (thanks, sharkus414), and even a Joplin rag (no, not Maple Leaf Rag, but don't let me stop you from doing that). I copied last month with a couple of popular intermediate-level Bach and Chopin pieces as those always get a good response (and I like a good response), although these two might be a little harder than last month's. I'm sure a few of you will already know the Debussy as well. There are a lot of pieces to choose from, so hopefully there's something for everyone!

It would still be great to hear some more national anthems or Olympic themes. And where have the Jazz guys/gals been (besides Sochamelet)? Howabout some Rhythm Changes or something?

1343049638.0	x0ixu	I suffer from near-crippling anxiety and depression, but I have never been happier than before since I started playing the piano. Questions!	guythatlikespiano	34	7	19	"I'll start off by saying I'm 16 (nearly 17) years old who currently suffers from Social Anxiety Disorder and as a result, I'm pretty damn depressed about it. I was never really (ever) into piano at all and I didn't really listen to much music, either. However, at school I was asked to give an attempt to learn the piano (I never really did anything in music class) and I instantly fell in love with it, so I bought a keyboard a few days later and started practicing for hours a day. I don't know how to describe it, it's almost like everything around me disappears while I play. My class was learning Fur Elise at the time, but I first learned Bach's Minuet and moved onto Fur Elise. While that definitely isn't a beginner song I am definitely progressing through it rather fast and have even gotten compliments from people including the teacher himself. Learning Fur Elise has also made me appreciate classical music, I could listen to it for hours rather than the junk that gets passed off as ""music"" today.

Anyway, outside of the teacher I have for my school's music class (which I only have a couple of times a week), I'm on my own right now. My parents are willing to pay for a teacher, but with my anxiety as it is now I just don't see it happening for a while.

Question time!

1. How limited am I to learning the piano without a teacher?
2. I intend on finishing Fur Elise, and after that I will be looking for more music to play. Could you recommend any for a beginner that's similar in difficulty to Fur Elise?
3. I've searched this subreddit for hours and I've compiled lists and lists of sites about music theory and tutorials/lessons on piano. However, there may have been some amazing new (or old) site I may have missed. Do you know of any? Also, any book suggestions would be great.
4. I've heard that many beginner piano players who attempt to teach themselves develop bad habits over time, could you list a few common ones that I might have so I can catch them before they become too ingrained into my brain?
5. I imagine this is probably not recommended for a beginner, but I've been interested in learning to playing by ear but shockingly Google doesn't provide too much on learning to do this. This may also be a little too much to explain in a Reddit post, but perhaps there's a book or something about it?

I'm sure I missed something. I have so many questions but I'd be here night and day if I asked them all. I can't wait to read your responses! Thank you!"	t5_2qnw8	True

Hey everyone! The Piano Jam is back with brand new selections for all skill levels, all falling under the theme of Valentine's Day / Love for this month. Hopefully you can find something below that stirs your heart and makes you want to get off Reddit and sit down at the piano. :) Remember you can choose to share anything (doesn't even have to be ""love"" themed). I look forward to hearing whatever you choose to play!

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces each month covering different skill levels and styles, but you are free to pick a different piece. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play!

I had a perfect opportunity to at an earlier age when my parents had acquired a baby grand but hadn't been exposed to some amazing pieces of music to know what was capable. So, in the eyes of an 11yr old it looked like chores and I had no interest. Teenage things and college just took priority and I never pursued it. All my friends are musicians in some way (drums, guitar, singing) but no real pianist in the group.

I did have some musical experience around that age tho. I had taken some trumpet &amp; clarinet lessons in middle school. On my own, by just listening to the music, I sorta figured out a few notes from The Simpsons and Superman. So I think I may have something there that would work to my advantage.

In my head I have great sounds I would like to get out but no method. I wouldn't be looking to create original music but more to have that skill under my belt and have another creative outlet to coincide with my art.

What would I look at to start equipment wise? What good ""on your own"" lessons are there out there?

Thanks.

1368818169.0	1ej9jg	My relationship with the piano.	JohntheCoyne	34	12	31	"I've been going through a bit of a pianist identity crisis. Let me explain.

So I've been playing piano for around 12 years now. I'm seventeen years old, and music is always on my mind. I'll spend a whole period in class thinking of how cool it is that parallel chromatically descending tritones fit so well into a circle of fifths progression, and my fingers are busy ""playing"" what I'm thinking of on the desk. I hope some of you reading know what I'm talking about, being so involved with an instrument that it governs a lot of your thoughts. It's a really bizarre place to be in when you start thinking of chords in colors rather than names or scale degrees. But I digress.

In my school, I'm known as being fairly proficient at the instrument. I took AP Music Theory a year only by skipping the pre-requisite class and the teachers are talking about offering me a student conductor position. I've musical directed a show, been drum major, and play a bunch of other instruments. Music can be a struggle, but it has been victorious until recently. To give you an idea of where I'm at on the instrument, I got a 100 (a perfect score) on [Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# Minor,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXQCPAR0EHo) a fairly challenging piece last year at NYSSMA (New York State Student Music Association) festival. Things went pretty well. Until this year.

It started last summer when I realized the flaws with my playing. My practice techniques and ethics are horrible. I accidentally skipped an entire measure of the Rach Prelude and still got a perfect score. I started thinking that the things that I'm very critical of go practically unnoticed by even NYSSMA judges. There were sections I didn't even learn the whole way through. You know when you have those few measures that you think ""Yeah, I'll fix them eventually,"" but then never fix them? They were it. So I decided to challenge myself with a real toughie to whip my practice habits into shape. I knew if I chose an awesome enough piece, I would have a hard time going on through mistakes without fixing them. I chose the solo piano version of [Rhapsody in Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQVbL99qZGo) (I'm not sure if this is the right arrangement, but the difficulty is about the same). Lasting from 14-20 minutes long, Rhapsody in Blue is a piece to be reckoned with, but it is so incredibly beautiful.

This is where my problem started. I really loved the piece at the beginning. The first few pages were so enjoyable. They were hard, yes, but I lived for it. But as the piece got harder, my enjoyment went down. There are sections of that piece that I've learned aren't playable by my hands. Maybe it's my piano, or something about my technique. But I've tried for so many hours at a few different sections and I can't do them. I've tried to eliminate ""can't"" from my vocabulary, but it has been 10 months since I started. I still can't play it. Granted, I haven't really worked at it in 5 months. To be honest, I haven't worked on anything in 5 months. I keep myself busy in other ways, but the last 5 months have been terrible on piano.

Every time I sit down to play the thing I used to love more than anything else in the world, I hate it. I hate my lack of ability. I hate that I've been learning for 12 years, and I can't even play Rhapsody in Blue. All of the ""don't be so hard on yourself"" comments in the world have done nothing for me. I can't stop being so hard on myself because it is through self-criticism that I get better. But now my critical introspection has reached a point of counter-productivity. My 12th piano recital is today. I'm playing [Missing the War by Ben Folds.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Sdr9_1PFY) I am beyond embarrassed. It's a great tune, don't get me wrong, but it's no Prelude in C# Minor. It's no Rhapsody in Blue. In the past, I've played Brubeck's Blue Rondo Alla Turk and my own arrangement of Bohemian Rhapsody. My song (and yes, it is a song. It has words. And I am playing it at a recital. Pitiful.) is worse than the one I played four years ago. Granted, the recital is comprised of Disney songs played by ten year olds, but this is just a terrible reflection upon who I am as a musician. Or is it? Actually, this is pretty accurate. I'm someone with such a destructive attitude towards music that I can put myself back years in my abilities.

I was pretty secure in my aspiration to be a film composer for a few years. But now I don't know. I can't stand playing music most of the time. I have a lot of other interests that I would love to pursue, but I'd feel terrible abandoning music. Putting 12 years of lessons away? Music is something that will never leave me, whether I like it or not.

Maybe this is a rut. A 5 month rut. And hopefully I'll grow out of it.

1330763119.0	qfpza	My humble suggestion for beginners and reminder to seasoned players.	jecrois	30	6	8	A lot people are always asking for advice about learning piano without a teacher and I think that is great.  As someone who has taken that path I want to make a suggestion that I feel is very useful. It might seem overly basic, but I think one of the most important and easiest ways to improve your piano skills is to evaluate your overall posture in relation to the piano.  This is fundamental, yet often overlooked or forgotten. You could write an entire book on the art of mechanics and importance of economy of motion for developing technique. So I won’t attempt to cover everything.  For me the two most important changes that improve my playing were seat height and placement.  I used to use a standard piano bench and one day I happened to put a chair down in front of my piano that was a few inches shorter. I immediately noticed a huge difference.  Another time I discovered a marked improvement when I sat with my midline a few inches right of center so that my belly button lined up around G#.  Everyone’s body is unique so you have to discover for yourself through trial and error what works best.    But remembering to be conscientious of your body instead of letting it go on autopilot is critical to attaining the chops your desire.	t5_2qnw8	True

I learnt piano classically, taking lessons from age 10 til 18, then switched out of the music degree I had started after burning myself out on something I wanted to be passionate about, but wasn't really putting any effort into. 

I didn't touch the piano for about 6 months, but now I've bought a digital piano and I'm itching to actually put in the practice and develop my skill level, which despite my years of playing, I feel I'm quite average! I never used to put in much practice at all, and practice I did do was bad practice almost certainly. It surprises me I made it as far as I did to be honest. 

I've since moved away from my original teacher, and now can not afford piano lessons, at least for the time being. My question is how can I reliably self teach myself - luckily I have learnt a lot of techniques or know some of where problem areas lie, however I don't know what I don't know, and bad habits are easy to acquire. I'll be attempting to up in skill level too, which puts me in unchartered territory!

Do I try not to go too far until I can afford a teacher, or do I battle on? Are there any programs I can follow to keep myself progressing accurately (part of my problem is choosing appropriately demanding repertoire)?"	t5_2qnw8	True

1362456148.0	19opn6	Piano Jam #15 (March) - Women Composers	pianoboy	25	4	12	"**Piano Jam #15 (March, 2013) -- Women Composers**

Given that March is [Women's History Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_History_Month) in the U.S., and March 8th is International Women's Day, I thought that this was the perfect opportunity for this month's piano jam to highlight some of the amazing women who composed for the piano!

Now before you say that we shouldn't need to distinguish works by gender or single out any gender, you're right... However, women composers and their works have historically been overlooked, under-performed, and largely forgotten, and it still happens in this day and age. I also know that most people (including me) couldn't name more than a couple of significant female composers if asked. So I think it's great to be able to shed light on any group of musicians that haven't been given the recognition they deserve.

A couple of articles for you:

* [Women Composers (history, neglect, restoring recognition)](http://oboeclassics.com/~oboe3583/ambache/women.htm)

* [Summary of classical women composers](http://www.piano-lessons.net/news_item.php?id=66)


Now it's not that hard to find great piano pieces composed by women... However, gathering a selection that's suitable for the piano jam -- pieces that are relatively short AND that cover a variety of women composers over a range of eras/genres AND skill-levels AND that have linkable sheet music -- that was more of a challenge! So don't take the selections below as trying to be representative of the greatest works by female composers or anything; Since this is a piano jam post, my goal is just to try to provide a good cross-section of learnable pieces that happen to be written by talented women.

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces each month covering different skill levels and styles, but you are free to pick a different piece. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! 

**Guidelines:**

* You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. Please put ""[Piano Jam]"" somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for.

* Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability.

* You do not have to complete pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the community!

* Remember: You are always welcome to choose something else not in the list to work on and share with everyone!

1337961962.0	u4mkp	21 year old trying to get back into piano. Is it possible? Is it realistic? How should I go about doing this?	xyals	23	3	56	"I've seen lots of threads about young adults with no experience in music wanting to start the piano and asking about the process. My situation is a bit different. I've studied piano with a teacher (respected that man from the moment I began lessons with him despite the fact that I consider myself as his worst student) since I was 10 or 11 until I was 18 (or 17 can't remember). Even though we talked a lot about music theory and the composition of pieces (mainly identifying chords, patterns, scales used in pieces) I never really paid attention, I've basically spent all those years under him just pressing keys according to the sheet music. I never put much effort or time in practicing piano and just played the music I wanted.

My piano ability comes down to reading level 5-6 sheet music rather fluently. I can read level 7-8 sheet music as well but it will take me a bit of time to play it. I can't sight read anything beyond level 5, I can't play by sound, I know to read key signatures and know C major scale and F major scale by heart but haven't memorized anything else such as triads, chords etc, I won't be able to pick up what chord or scale a particular measure was in by sight reading (I will only recognize it after it has been identified for me or I spend time to work it out). In short I know nothing about music theory, I can't sight the majority of the pieces I'm interested in, I can't play by ear, and no good method for memorizing pieces.

With that kind of background in piano, what should I do to get back into it? I mainly want to be able to sight read quite well (interested in video game sound tracks, movie/tv sound tracks) and memorize some pieces.

The piano is an older Sohmer upright that I got for free a couple years ago, and it was very badly out-of-tune. Our kids are now old enough to start lessons, so just yesterday we paid $200 to have it tuned. But when I checked it today using an iPhone app and an electronic keyboard, it's clearly flat. It's in tune with itself, so it should be fine for playing solo, but I'm not sure if I should call out the tuner on this mis-tuning, especially considering it's probably going to need to be re-tuned in a few months due to it being so badly out of tune in the first place.

Fall is upon us and Halloween is approaching. This month brings a whole new batch of great pieces for all skill levels, including a few Halloween-themed ones mixed in with the usual fare, as well as the perfect Jazz standard for the season: Autumn Leaves. Thanks for the great suggestions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/10pygl/help_select_piano_jam_pieces/). The participation last month was phenomenal, and I look forward to another great month!

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces and other ideas for each month, but you are free to submit anything. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play!

Fingerings"	Monetka	22	3	32	"**What are general tips / guidlines for proper piano fingering?**

I have found this tips:

---

* avoid unnecessary changes of hand position

* if it's possible then use finger crossing over / under while changing hand position

* if changing hand position is necessary then try to do it at the end of bar / phrase

* if changing hand position is necessary and if it's possible then try to use thumb as first finger in a next phrase

* use longer fingers (2, 3, 4) for black keys

---

([source](https://www.webdepot.umontreal.ca/Usagers/belkina/MonDepotPublic/Piano/PianoTechnique.html#fingering))

* Try to organize fingering/shifts into rhythmically regular groups.

* Given a choice between fingerings which require many shifts or few, aim for fewer shifts. 

* The same musical pattern should usually be played with the same fingering, regardless of the presence or absence of black notes. 

* Try to make shifts in both hands at the same time, when possible.

---

([source](http://pianocheater.com/docs/practice/fingering.html))

* Watch the min and max range of notes for the section you're on, and figure out how you can make your fingers ""cover em"" best with minimal hand position changes.

* For chord after chord after chord type sections, you'll probably be moving hand positions. Otherwise, try to keep your hands somewhat stationary so you'll know what notes you have ""under your fingers"" easier.

* If possible, try to keep your thumb or your pinky ""anchoring"" your hand.

---
([source](http://pianocheater.com/docs/practice/fingering.html) \ tips from ""Kreisler"" at [pianoworld.com](http://www.pianoworld.com/forum/) forums)

* move your whole hand to a new position rather than ""really really REALLY stretching"" fingers. But also try to minimize hand hops.

* try to use your strongest fingers for important notes: first thumb, then index, then middle.

* try to minimize thumbs and pinkies on black notes since they're short, they'll squish the rest of your fingers up too far.

* practice thumb under (and 2nd or 3rd over the thumb) for smooth legato melodies. For very very fast melodies, you'll need to use what's CALLED thumb over, but really just means ""scoot your whole hand"".

* pay special attention to smooth transitions between passages of the music

* DON'T bother with fingering the ""easy"" spots.  Clearer is better.

* if the finger doesn't move, DON'T mark it on the 2nd note.  Just look back across the line.

* sometimes awkward fingering in an earlier passage ""sets up"" the start of the next passage

* determine fingering - BEFORE- practicing. You want your brain and fingers to remember ONE fingering. Not a couple variations swapped in and out randomly.

* know what notes are under your fingers so you DON'T HAVE TO LOOK DOWN. that's why we have black keys.  so the hand can always FEEL where it is.

* for chords, scales and arpeggios try to use standard fingering

* if possible, anchor your hand via the thumb or pinky and keep your fingers on successive keys of the scale to match the sheet music. So you can ""feel intervals"" 

* when extending to reach a ""way out there"" note, use either the fingers or   else the thumb.  then move it back so you always know what it's covering. Try to move either the thumb OR the fingers as a group.
  You don't want to have to readjust gaps between the 4 fingers.

**Jazz / Improv / Composition:**

* How about highlighting a musical mode of your choice (e.g. D Dorian) in a composition or existing piece. Could be fun!

Oh, also, theconk [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/rlz85/piano_jam_reminder_and_next_month/) that we should do something to go along with r/classicalmusic's composer of the month -- a great idea. Well, their [April choice is out](http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic//comments/roeux/aprils_composer_of_the_month_is_chad_kroeger/), and so I'll be expecting a beautiful Nickleback rendition from you, theconk ;)

**Piano Jam #2 - Love**

With Valentine's Day approaching, whether you love it or hate it, the season of love is upon us. The selections this month reflect this theme of love... well, maybe not the mysterious - almost haunting - Gnossienne #3, unless you see it representing the lost and lonely times in life when we wander aimlessly, wondering if there is any love for us at all... ... ... (I'm so deep). I'm not a huge 3/4 fan, but one thing I learned from this month's choices is that Love loves a good triple metre. Thanks again to everyone for [all the great suggestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/oycvi/piano_jam_reminder_planning_help_pick_next_months/)! I think there is a large enough backlog that I don't even need to ask for requests next month.

My brother has been experimenting and making his own music for years, everything from his first guitar at 12 years old(he is 27) to a MIDI keyboard and drum kit, he is very talented.  I backed him and his friends up on bass guitar from time to time.

Where should I start? I absolutely have the time and interest in this to take lessons regularly, but as for my own personal beginnings what should I look for? No one in my life has piano experience.

I know I want a full 88 key, digital(roommates) setup. I would rather spend and buy something quality that will last me years than an entry level see-if-you-like-it model...

1351402006.0	127if2	$500 keyboard not cutting it... will a $1500 do the trick?	Bender1012	23	5	12	"First off a little background... basically I went through high school and college playing Yamahas and Steinways. Now I live in a shared apartment in NYC so a real piano is not an option. Money is also an issue.

The past 3 months I've been using a [Casio Privia](http://www.amazon.com/Casio-Privia-PX-130-88-Key-Digital/dp/B002IVK0FE/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351400637&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=casio+privia+px-120), which honestly I thought has been pretty good so far. Good sound, 88 weighted keys, action not too bad.

 The only drawback is that it doesn't seem like it can handle the music I'm trying to play... I'm currently working on Hiromi's ""[The Tom and Jerry Show](http://grooveshark.com/s/Tom+And+Jerry+Show/2DosZ?src=5)"", and with only about 6-8 hours a week spent practicing it over the course of 3 months, I can already feel the action of the keys ""giving"" and becoming looser. This is a problem.

Also, about a week ago I went back to visit my alma mater and of course headed back to the ol' practice rooms. Holy cow did those Steinways feel nice. I mean obviously I can't expect my Casio to feel as nice as something literally 2 orders of magnitude more expensive, but it was really a wake-up call for what I'd been missing since I graduated. 

Now to the present matter and original question of this post. A few weeks ago I glanced over someone's post asking about a Roland in the range of about $1500. My question is, if I feel like I'm outgrowing my $500 Casio, will a Roland or other keyboard in the $1500 range be that much better? Will the action feel that much better, and will the keys hold up? I really haven't even begun to do the necessary research, like reading reviews, or heading to a music store to try some out, but I figured I'd ask you guys first. Thanks for any help, and rock on."	t5_2qnw8	True

I think I need to vent.	plongpling	23	6	36	"Hi /r/piano. Let me warn you, this is going to be long and probably uninteresting. I just feel like I need to express these feelings *somewhere* before I can get at peace with them and go on. However, there are a few actual questions at the end of my post.


I'm 23, and have a complex and painful relation with the piano and music in general. I would like to learn how to play, but I've got some crippling shyness/self-confidence issues that make me want to cry at the idea of anyone hearing me play music. I'm even using a throwaway for this, just in case anyone I know in real life finds out I'm even considering taking lessons.


I've taken approximately 3-4 years of piano lessons as a kid, first with a teacher (for the first year), then at a music school. It was a *very* bad experience, I was afraid of my teachers, arrived late to class every week so that I could spend less time getting yelled at/told I sucked/having my fingers painfully pressed on the keys by the teacher etc. I eventually gave up in my fourth year, after my mom talked with the teachers several times (and offered to many more times, but I was so afraid of them I though they would exact revenge on me if I sent my mom) and nothing got better.

I liked playing though... But the lessons were terrible, and the fact that anyone could hear me playing (badly) was *unbearable*. I could only practice when no one was home. The final point when I absolutely didn't want to play a note anymore was when the neighbor, and old lady, said she liked when I played the piano. Although this was a compliment, I then realized anyone could still hear me even when our apartment was empty. And so I was done. I told my mom, who even offered to buy me a Clavinova so that I could practice with headphones on, but I was so discouraged I didn't want her to invest that much money in something I would give up on anyway.


A few years later, in high school, I expressed the desire to play again. My mom got me a cheap (well shitty but not so cheap in the overpriced-only-music-store-in-the-region) 61 key keyboard and I tried to learn a few songs, but quickly gave up (no teacher, no motivation, no nothing). Since then I've been longing to play but never found the motivation to get over my fears and try again. Until this year.

Last Christmas, I went to visit my mom with my boyfriend, who thought it would be a good idea to pick up the keyboard that was gathering dust at her place and bring it back home. A few weeks later, I finally got the courage to say I wanted to play again. I've been playing since then (end of January/early February)... kind of. I learned a few songs, but quickly ran into problems when my wrists gave me so much pain I could barely type, let alone play. So I stopped playing for 3 months after having only played for 2. Now (as of the last few weeks) I'm back to playing again.

Throughout all of this, I almost always played with headphones on, even when my boyfriend's not home, and even though he's completely supportive and expressed the desire to hear my music. I forced myself to play in front of him a few times (the first time I did he told me he was actually surprised because with all I said, he was expecting my level to be worse than it is), but it was **hard**. I also tried to record myself to send a video to my mom (she always regretted not having taken piano lessons as a kid and was sad and disappointed that I gave up when she gave me the opportunity she didn't have. I wanted to surprise her and show her I stuck with it), but this proved an impossible task. I was so stressed out that I gave up after maybe 40 tries on several different days, and never getting it right.

But... yeah. With all that, I still play, if only for myself. And I do want to get better, and lessons sound like they would be good for me because I feel like I've got no direction. I need some kind of guidance. I don't know what to play, and I want to discover songs, not play things I already know.

**TL;DR: Piano lessons as a kid were horrible, which left me scarred and afraid to play in front of anyone. But I do want to play!**

**Well, this was overly long, but this is the end of my story. Now for the questions.**

So, the logical next step for me would be to get a teacher. I've done my homework and googled piano teachers in my city, but I don't know where to go from there. I found shitty ads with spelling mistakes ; music schools which look terrible ; teachers that seem to only teach chords/modern songs (I'd like to play a bit of everything, but would largely prefer classical music over pop songs).

With my previous experience with music schools, I think I want a personal, home teacher. But I'm too shy to call them, especially when I'm not so sure about the ad. **What should I look for in a teacher? Are there any red flags to avoid in ads? Are musical students any good at teaching, or should I look for a seasoned teacher?** (I typically ask a LOT of questions in class, and need someone who knows everything perfectly. I've been known to be a tough student for teachers who have gaps in their knowledge. I don't know if I will be the same with piano.)

I'm also afraid that they will force me to learn in a way I do not wish to. For instance, I've always learned a song by playing hands separately first and only then playing them together, and I've got absolutely no interest in trying to sight read both scores at once. **Will I be forced to do that? Do teachers adapt their method to their students, or stick with what they're used to?**

I'm also concerned because of my shitty 61 key keyboard. As a kid, we had a real piano at home, albeit a shitty, old one too. The pedals were broken, so I never learned how to use them, and the keys sticked and were so grippy I couldn't slide my fingers on them, so it was always weird playing on the nice piano at the music school and my fingers always slipped on the ""slippery"" (normal) keys. I'm afraid it will be even worse with what I've got now. I'm looking to replace my keyboard with a weighted, 88 key one (the 61 keys are SO frustrating, I feel like I can't play *anything*), but I'm still a student and don't want to invest the money if I'm going to get discouraged and give up again. I could afford it (I'm selling my car), but I want to be sure first. Moreover, in one on the ads I found, the guy said he would *not* teach on synths/keyboards. Is this common? **Do I *need* a real piano in order for teachers to take me as a student?**

Lastly, how does a first lesson usually go? Should I explain all this to the teacher? Do I have to play something in front of them? If so, should I play something they know (killing Bach a second time in the process) or something they don't know (so they can't compare to the real deal and I feel less humiliated)?

I think it all boils down to this: **How can I find a teacher that will accept a student with so many problems?**

Edit: I forgot a question. Doctors have been stumped about my wrist/forearm pain (in both wrists, but the right one more than the left - I'm lefthanded by the way, and switched the computer mouse to the left since this started). This happened a few times in the past, always when I used ""typing"" motions much (when I tried to get back to playing the keyboard in high school, when I played a lot of computer games, when I work on a computer). No CTS, no tenosynovitis, no inflammation, ""just take some painkillers and a muscle relaxant and see how it goes"". Did that ever happen to anyone here? Any idea?"	t5_2qnw8	True

Hi everyone! Piano Jam is back! ...ummm, well, probably for just one last hurrah. I think this is going to be the last piano jam, at least for a while, or at least put together by me. It feels like it's time to take a break and allow for something new to keep things fresh and exciting. We've had an amazingly great run -- about a year and a half, and the community participation has far exceeded any expectations I had. It has been so rewarding and so much fun. I look forward to helping organize some other /r/piano events in the future. Thanks for all your support and for sharing your talents with the community!

This month has selections spanning classical, **cuban danza** (don't know if that's a genre), jazz, ragtime, pop, and video game music. As always, the pieces span a range of skill levels and are usually fairly short. Hopefully there's something that piques your interest!

**Guidelines:**

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is just a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. We select some suggested pieces and other ideas for each month, but you are free to submit anything. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines below and check out all the previous piano jams in the sidebar.

* You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. Please put ""[Piano Jam]"" somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for.

* Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability.

* You do not have to complete pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the community!

* Remember: You are always welcome to choose something else not in the list to work on and share with everyone!

1336165144.0	t7fh9	how to best practice and recognize: intervals, chords, and more...	PianoLove	23	7	14	"Hey Reddit Piano, 

 I am starting to learn to play the piano. I spent ages reading on theory and history, now I finally have the time, dedication, and drive to get to the real issue - Practice, Practice, and more Practice.

 One of the issues I came up against is getting my mind recognize the various types of intervals and translate them immediately to my fingers without much conscious thought. i.e. simply put, if a note is on middle C and on C above it then it is a perfect octave apart or something like a Major Third, etc. 

 I have been focusing very strongly on this lately, since in the future I want to be able to fluently read sheet music without much effort when I encounter new songs. I want to be able to pick up a song and start reading, and then let my fingers do the playing by recognizing chords, and intervals, and knowing the positions, spacings and jumps, intuitively etc.  

 I started to make my own practice sheets with MuseScore, but stopped to see if there are any recommendations already out there. I'd hate to recreate the wheel. I am not too picky, so I don't care if the practice is an easy song or a super complex song or something not really musical but has all the elements that I need just as a practice sheet. 

 I am picking up on all sorts of note intervals just from the stuff I am practicing, but I was hoping that there would be something systematic, refined, and covered all the bases by the time I finished those practice sheets. Perhaps even in a certain order from easiest to hardest (i.e. it's pretty easy to pick up a note on a space and a note on an adjacent line, harder to pick up on a fourth or an octave right away and even harder to spot a specific chord or one if it's inversions and so on).

If anyone has practice with this particular focus please fill me in on any tips, pitfalls, or info you might have. If you have specific sheet music to use that exemplifies this type of learning progression then by all means I'd love to have the sheet music or even just a list of songs that can help me cover certain bases (i.e. list the song and the interval practice it has repeatedly in it).  

Thx!"	t5_2qnw8	True

1334013957.0	s1lwv	Getting the most out of piano lessons	Grezzz	23	5	9	"I have been teaching myself piano for about 6 months now, and whilst I'm happy with my progress I feel like some extra structure/accountability would help.  I also want to ensure that I am learning the correct technique and not picking up bad habits that will hurt my progress.  I have been observing this subreddit for a while now and everybody seems very vocal about the benefits of taking piano lessons.

I just wanted to ask some questions from experienced teachers/pianists before I go ahead and book my lessons.

1) Preparation


Is there anything specific that I should work on before I start lessons?  I would feel bad if I paid for lessons just to do something that I could have done by myself.


2) Lesson Structure


I have never had any formal music training, what should I expect? What does a typical lesson include?


3) Good/Bad Teachers


As with everything, I imagine there will be a varying degree of quality between teachers.  Are there any tell-tale signs that I should look out for?  I want to feel confident that I am receiving a good quality service.


4) Lesson frequency


How often would you typically advise somebody to take lessons? I might not be able to afford to take regular lessons, what would be the longest gap you would typically leave between lessons before it becomes a problem?


Anything else that might help would also be appreciated :)

Thanks,
Grezzz"	t5_2qnw8	True

I've cued it up [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=OKUhQcuKgS0#t=86s) 

Those quarter note octaves are no problem, but the triplet and sixteenths **are**. Any suggestions? I find that my whole hand/arm/shoulder tighten up when I try to play it up to speed, but I don't know how to achieve the speed I want!

Edit: I should clarify. My problem isn't about note accuracy. It's about not physically being able to move my hand fast enough. Think of it like playing a CM scale in octaves. The notes aren't a problem, you simply hit a point where you just can't go any faster. So how do I work on that speed?"	t5_2qnw8	True

*I personally consider acoustic pianos and digital keyboard separate instruments which are good at different things and the phrasing of the following questions reflects that.*

----

**Assuming you use both instruments regularly:**

* How do you use each instrument in your daily life?
* Do you prefer playing certain repertoire on one instrument over the other?
* What's the biggest advantage pianos have over keyboards for you personally?  Vice-versa?
* Did you pick the action of your keyboard based on the action of your piano?  Vice-versa?

**Assuming you only use one instrument regularly:**

* Piano or keyboard?
* Do you make a conscious choice to only a piano or only a keyboard?  Or are you limited by budget, living situation, etc.?
* Do you find it hard to adapt when you're presented with a situation where the other instrument is available?
* Other thoughts?

Eventually I want to be able to play a piano just by looking at the sheet music. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm going. What is the logical progression I should follow. Like, use only one hand first to learn melody. Then, memorize notes. Then, use left hand for chords, and play with both hands at once. Give me a series of steps. Like, learn to do this first. Second, do this. Third, do this. Etc Etc. Thank you!	t5_2qnw8	True

I bought a synth few months ago and haven't really got around to playing as much as I'd like. So I felt reading a textbook about the basics (and perhaps following some exercises etc) would help me a lot. As today's book market is infested with all kinds of ""not so useful"" textbooks I thought I'd ask from people who are more aware what's out there.

My level currently is that I know the basic chords and I can read sheet music (although rather slowly still).


And the only requirement I have is that I could order the book from https://www.bookdepository.co.uk/ as it has free transport (EU only but that's perfect for me).

1340847877.0	vpujp	Back from conservation 1856 Erard Grand-Piano.	pardinucular	18	1	10	"The Erard piano came back from the conservation workshops from a major clean and repair. 
Here is the final result:

http://i.imgur.com/aQnTb.jpg

The decoration of the piano is made up of a water gilded surface, with elaborate oil painted scenes to the lids and sides and finished off with a varnish. 
The main challenge was to remove the substantial surface dirt that had collected on the two main lids and the upper surfaces during the piano’s lifetime (it was comissioned in 1856). There were also large areas of loss to the varnish on the lids where damage had occurred over time.
Detail of lid during conservation:

http://i.imgur.com/fVdoc.jpg

A piano leg, mid clean, showing surface dirt:

http://i.imgur.com/K0Fvj.jpg

Losses of carving to the ornate legs and other parts of the piano also required attention. The first step was to undertake various solvent tests in discreet areas, to ascertain the best method of safely removing the dirt. The solvent which proved most efficient was Industrial Methylated Spirits which allowed the dirt to be lifted from the varnish without affecting the lower layers and, more importantly, not disturbing the painted decoration
Metal mounts before and after cleaning:

http://i.imgur.com/uHSyg.jpg

The large areas of loss to the varnish on the main lids were replaced using a dried version of the varnish and building this area back up to tie in with the original surface. These small, dried pieces of varnish were adhered with a dissolved version. Losses to the carved elements on the legs and piano sides were re-carved in lime wood and smaller areas were replaced with a special putty used for gilded surfaces. These replacements were re-gilded with gold leaf and toned to match the original gilding. The other areas of gilding were cleaned with a conservation grade mild soap to remove the excess dirt. Any losses to the painted decoration were retouched with acrylic paints. A final layer of varnish was added to the lids to protect and bring together the new varnish with the old. The metal mounts were cleaned with a conservation grade metal cleaner.
