1333383401.0	rpo80	What are your thoughts on the whole obsession with outdoor gear and clothing? 	curiousparlante	31	8	38	"Hey fellow outdoors-men/women! I wasn't quite sure where to post this question, so I figured the most general outdoors subreddit would do. 

Sometimes, and in particular when I page through an outdoors magazine like, for example, Backpacker, I feel like there's an obsession with special gear and clothing designed for ""improving the outdoor experience"". Yes, if you're a hiker you need various items, and if you're a biker you need a decent bike, a helmet, and maybe some other things. However, I can't help but get annoyed whenever I see some derp ride by on a really nice bike with his/her fancy biking outfit which isn't really helping them bike faster or last longer. I mountain bike frequently and have no special clothing, and sometimes when I come across other bikers I get the impression that they think I'm a chump for not having fancy bike clothes. 

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE fancy gear. I could spend thousands of dollars in an EMS/REI. I love nice jackets and have bought plenty of stuff off of Steepandcheap.com (great site if you don't know about it!). I just can't help but be annoyed every once in a while when I come across an advertisement for the newest X-Factor Polychromal Micro-figment Anti-Smell-Tiger Gooch Lined T-Shirt. I run in a local park where I get to see people of all shapes and sizes exercise; a good portion of them wear these fancy t-shirts and shorts, for something like a 20-minute run. Why not just save your money and wear a normal t-shirt? (Yes, I do have a fancy running t-shirt too, though I found it in a bargain bin somewhere. If it's dirty I just wear an old t-shirt). 

So I'm turning to you folks to request your thoughts on the matter. Where do you drawn the line on fancy gear? Do you feel like there is some sort of obsession with having the newest, fastest shoes/shorts/jacket/backpack? Does it even matter? What are the items that you find more reasonable?

My eldest son has been going to camp Tippecanoe in NE Ohio for 8 years now. His younger brother will be able to attend camp for the very first time this coming summer. I had a chance to win a week at camp by submitting a post about what I am thankful to Camp Tippecanoe for. I was thrilled to learn that I am one of 10 finalists - we have one week to get as many ""likes"" on our post as possible. This ends on the 26th. The posts with the most likes gets it!  Winning would ensure that both boys get a week at camp (as an aside, one week of standard adventure camp costs about $400. We are a family of 7 with a recent lay off. We have no idea if we could afford to send both boys when the time comes, so would love to win this).  If any of you would be willing to lend a hand and follow my link to Facebook and click that little ""like"" button, we would really appreciate it!

I can't seem to remember what we had with us when we went out though. I mean, we would mostly rough it I guess. We never camped near a bathroom or any real sites ever. We would basically hike up Mt. Jefferson in NH or something, find a suitable place to camp for the night and spend a day or two just being in the woods. That's what I want. I want very minimalist camping. Not a lot to carry, particularly. Can someone give opinions on one, some, or all of the following:

* In terms of food and such, I don't know what I would bring for a weekend. I don't want to lug a cooler up a mountain but I also don't want to live off granola for 2 days. I know (more or less) how to build a fire and have a mess kit and such. But I don't even know what I would cook. I was thinking beans are a good idea. Any fruit or vegetables that are easily packed and/or cooked? I'm familiar with the freeze dried meals but I kind of want to conserve water.

* How much water should I carry? My dad had ""platypuses"", should I bother getting one? He also had a sort of pump filter. You put one end in the brook or whatever and the other end in your bottle. Pump it up and viola! Filtered water. Similar to [this one](http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12544780&amp;cp=3677338.11359842.10754173). I don't have a lot of money, particularly not $70-90 to drop on one of these. Can I get away without one and just carry my water? Any other water purification techniques?

* What are some essentials to keep in your pack? We had an ""oh shit kit"" in our packs for emergencies. It had water proof matches, a thermal blanket, small first aid, etc. I still have my kit, just not the shit in it. What should go in there? Also, the obvious things, (or to me not so obvious) like a mess kit, sleeping bag, etc. Basically, when you go out what do you need or find yourself needing? Your checklist, per say.

* I also intend to bring my fancy expensive camera. Maybe this is a question for a different sub but I'm concerned on how I would carry it/care for it *in the wild*. I want to keep my pack to a minimum, you see. I believe simplicity is the best way to go about anything. I don't want an extra bag hanging off an inconvenient place while I hike for 5 hours, you know? So I guess the question is, if you have to bring something valuable/fragile, how do you go about bringing that along safely?

* Any other off tips or crucial advice? I intend to challenge myself but have a good time doing it. In *Nature*.

Possibly helpful information:

I have a tent, mess kit, pack, and sleeping bag. That's about it. I'm sure I can find most things I need around my house, though, or pick up essentials before I go.

I am comfortable being dirty and nature-y. Bugs don't bother me, mud doesn't bother me, not showering for a couple days doesn't bother me. I don't need to feel clean and pretty or anywhere near home. I want to be ""wild"" for the weekend. No need of soap or things to keep dirt-free, I suppose."	t5_2qj57	True

I have some questions	dav2b3	20	0	18	"I am currently going to school for accounting and pretty sure I will spend most of my life in a business environment but I love the outdoors.  I'm only 21 and not quite sure what I want to do with my life.  I love the outdoors but I dont know if I could be and instructor everyday and I like accounting and I know in this world you need money to do things but I'm not sure if i could do this everday either.  Ideally, I'd like to have some kind of medium in my life as I get older and come to an agreement with my employer and be an accountant and maybe take two separate months off in a year to instruct. (don't if it will be possible but I am going to try)


My questions are:

1. How did you become an instructor?

2. Do you work doing anything else besides being an instructor?

3. How do you like it?

4. If you don't mind answering, how much do you make being an instructor?

5. Any advice for me?

Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks reddit!"	t5_2qj57	True

The campground is part of the Bents Basin park with a swimming hole, fishing, bushwalks etc. It has capacity of about 300 people and toilet/shower facilities as well as fire pits. 

We're looking at an expansion/upgrade of the facilities to bring more people to the area. I'd really appreciate some input from r/outdoors on what you guys like to see in a place like this. It's not a super rugged, off the beaten track kind of place. At the moment we've mostly got family groups and scouts etc coming through.

What sorts of facilities and activities are important to you for a camping getaway just outside the city? What have you seen elsewhere that you thought was a really great idea? Thanks guys.

This is a typical camp site at the moment with an iron ring firepit with a swing platform. Flat grass area and a fairly transparent tree screen separating it from other sites.

Our schedule is pretty flexible given we'll have a truck and nothing is finalized, but here's what we're thinking.  If you have any must-sees we'd love to hear em!  We generally like adventures, getting away from crowds, amazing scenery, once-in-a-lifetime experiences, etc.  Any tips you guys can offer will go a long way, I promise!

Here's the plan:

* Hike and kayak in Kenai Fjords Nat'l Park
* Visit Glacier Bay Nat'l Park

July (British Columbia / Alberta)

* Mountain bike north shore of Vancouver
* Visit Banff Nat'l Park
* Drive through the Icefields highway

August (Washington / Idaho / Wyoming / Montana)

I'm a college student whose been lucky enough to intern with the National Park Service (at Mt. Rainier) one summer and the USFWS(in Minnesota the subsequent summer. As part of the, ""building of a 21st century workforce,"" I have the chance to attend a several day long About-NPS/networking event at a National Park in a few months. Through learning from and speaking to NPS professionals, interfacing the Service's projects and my skills/interests (interpretation/environmental education), I will have a say in where I will intern this coming summer. 
What I'm asking, I guess, is where would you want to work in the National Park Service if you had the chance, and why? Locations with active Environmental Education/Outreach are of particular interest to me (so Alaska, perhaps not).
I'm awfully keen on the idea of working at Olympic, per my experience at Rainier, and I've also got my mind on Zion, Yosemite, Crater Lake.

The problem is, my only previous experience camping was a couple brief stints during my time sharpening sticks in the boy scouts, living in those infamous 'summer camp' tents that seemed to attract every daddy longlengs within a ten mile radius. Needless to say, I got tired of the great outdoors fairly quickly at camp. I spend a lot of time indoors studying and working, and I'd like to get out. 

Years later, I'm in college, living in Illinois, and I want to try to connect with the great outdoors once more - via backpacking and camping specifically. I'll try not to bore you with more details about my family history as it pertains to the outdoors (there is some, my mom's side is from Minnesota and from what i hear, camping was a big deal to them), and instead get straight to it: How do I get myself started? I'd like to be able to go out hiking, spend the night - possibly more than one - and then come back home without breaking a leg, or getting eaten by a bear.

My problem in that specific area is that I know nothing about camping and hiking. I know even less about what gear is involved.  What kind of gear do I need for an overnight hike that would be sufficient enough for it not to be a complete disaster? Would it be possible to get it at a modest price? (I'm a poor college kid!) Do you have any specific book recommendations that I should look into on the subject? Are there any books on backpacking/camping that are considered sacred how-to texts?

For a tent, I'm thinking 3-person (I doubt I'll ever go by myself, and even two people would work for it, I'd just rather have the space for three).  I'm looking at the Nemo Losi 3p and the Marmot Limelight 3p, and while there's a price difference, I'm not sure if it's worth going cheaper now and paying for it later.

For a sleeping bag, I think I've decided on down.  The Marmot Pinnacle bag looks really good and warm, but somehow every resource I've found suggests the pricier alternatives like the plasma.  Is there really going to be much of a difference between the two besides the ridiculous price?

Also, any thoughts on the SteriPen?  It looks pretty cool, but I've only ever used a real filter and aquamira.  

I've been doing my research, but I just thought I'd ask for some personalized advice.  Thanks!"	t5_2qj57	True

Park"	sunflowerlady	12	2	4	"There's a lot to be said for an out and back hike. Like taking a picture coming back that was maybe in the sun on the way out. Or finding a great lunch/snack spot you want to spend some time at. But with loop hikes the entire journey is a surprise so you tend to take it all in on the way out. One of my favorite loop hikes is the Highline Trail in Glacier National Park. We started from Logan Pass Visitor Center, hiked to Granite Park Chalet and then on down to the Loop, where we had left our car.

1332434248.0	r8jvx	Waterproof, solar-powered satellite phone?	knowledgeoverswag	10	0	5	"I figured this would be the place to ask.

In the movie Cast Away, Tom Hanks' character opens various FedEx boxes he finds on the beach to help him survive.  He gets ice skates that he uses to crack open coconuts and cut wood and VHS tapes that he uses for tying things down.

He leaves one box unopened as like a symbol.

Creator Robert Zemeckis said that in the unopened box was a waterproof, solar-powered satellite phone which ironically would have saved Tom Hanks' character.

Does such a thing even exist?

Even if it doesn't, what do you use to communicate with the outside world during emergencies?

Durable solar chargers and satellite phones certainly exist.  Do you just seal them up and break them out for the really big emergencies?

What do I need to get?	sampling_life	11	2	24	"Long story short I recently just got a job where I will be conducting field research for 5 months on a small island off the west coast of Africa.

I already have a rain jacket, day pack, boots (for daily use), water bottles, and normal clothes (not the super fast drying stuff).  

I currently have the 25% off REI sale coupon so I wanted to get a couple of big things like sleeping bag, sleeping mat (backpacking mat), a pack and maybe rain pants.  

I was wondering if anyone had suggestions on actual models I should get and maybe stuff I am missing that I would probably want to invest in and is the camping clothing really worth it?

I am going into my senior year and one of the privileges that comes with being a senior is you get to plan and lead a Spring Break trip.  Spring break trips are usually the best trips we offer and consist of 9 days to some awesome location.  We are based out of North Carolina and the only limitation is that we have to be able to drive to the location (less than 20hrs).  In the past we have done trips such as Backpacking in Arches National Park, Rock Climbing in Chattanooga, Sea Kayaking in the Florida Keys, and Canoeing in the Everglades.  I want to do something new and cool, but I also want to make the trip reasonable so that we can offer it to students that have little to no experience.  I am big into whitewater and climbing so I would love to incorporate both of these into a week long trip somehow even if it is just base camping.  I would prefer to go west of North Carolina but going all the way to colorado isn't really an option. Does anyone know of any cool places to go that are a reasonable distance away?

I've been poking around amazon and the rest of the internet and havent found too much like what we're looking for. Basically, something that does a very good job of repelling rain, while also keeping us warm. Nothing heavy like a full parka or a 4-in-1 jacket, as we live in Florida (it gets chilly enough here, and sometimes its like a damn rainforest), but enough to ward off anything above 20 degrees. We do a lot of hiking, camping, disc golfing, and other outdoor activities and feel like itd be a great gift for each other, one that'll be put to good use.

Anyone know of any really good jackets that they could recommend? Either for guys or girls is fine, we're not trying to match or anything, just something similar.

The sickened part because I feel really shitty and I typically have a very hardy immune system, and I get concerned when I get sick, because it happens so rarely.

I went hiking in an lake/trail area in Central Oklahoma and it was very overgrown and when I stopped (the crossing was flooded), I had hundreds of seedticks on me. That didn't concern me much, so I had cigarette and scraped them all off with the edge of my knife. Easy breezy. Went home showered. 

Woke up in the middle of the night feverishly scratching myself.

Hundreds of what appear to be chigger bites all over my ankles and legs, and buttocks. Probably 300-400 bites total. 

I've had worse, but I felt markedly sick since that hike. I don't know what kind of ticks they were, they were too small. THe larger ones were the regular brown ones. I only pulled a dozen or so off, but they were seated in.

I've been a lifelong fan of camping and hiking but I haven't been on a proper outdoors trip in years.  My good friend has invited me to go on a week+ long canoe trip in Quetico just before Labor Day and I am super excited, but also a little nervous.  I'll be with a small group, two of whom are Quetico veterans, but I was curious if anyone could offer any advice about things to bring or things to know.

Also, is there anything I can do fitness-wise between now and then to make certain I'm a boon to the group and not a drag?  I just started training for a half marathon and while I was lifting somewhat regularly that fell off a few months ago due to the demands of training, school, and work.  Now that it's summer again I'm hoping to get back into it, but the Half is in early September so that's my focus.

Things I already know for sure.  We'll have a sat phone and will each be carrying a Duluth pack.  Most of our food will be what we catch and find, two of the group are longtime hunters and fishers. Should I follow my instincts and bring Clif bars or trust in the collective knowledge of the vets?

Thanks in advance.  I have high hopes that this trip will be the beginning of more regular outdoors adventuring for me. I'm also hoping to have a [hiking companion](http://wanderingwolfy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/matthiessen-state-park-april-2011-585.jpg) in the near future.

However, it'll be a lot of work. I wouldn't consider myself an ""amazing"" outdoorsman yet, but I certainly have the drive to become one. I'm already an Eagle Scout, so I'm sure that will help me out.

I've been teaching High school biology and chemistry for about 6 years and I really enjoy my job. I have a lot of outdoor hobbies (surf / camping / hiking / biking /etc.), and I after a wonderful experience kayaking lake Michigan and a great guide I am contemplating a career in adventure tourism. I'm not completely sold on leaving the teaching profession, but the idea of trying something different while I am still young and relatively unencumbered by responsibility. I also have summers off so I could also take this up as a part time thing and try a few things. If you have any advice / opportunities to share I would be greatly appreciate your time. I would certainly be teaching this upcoming academic year but willing to start something this summer (early June).

TL;DR - High school science teacher looking for advice, guidance, opportunities working outdoors / adventure tourism. Possibly full time, but definitely summer 2012.  "	t5_2qj57	True

1297750692.0	flo4j	I have a few noobish questions...	atwharyow	11	3	14	"I heard this idea somewhere on Reddit about traveling for 6 months in the wilderness. I've seriously considered this for the past few weeks but I don't have the slightest clue as to where to start... on anything.

First off, what's backpacking? Is it just having a large pack with living essentials and walking around like that? Is it possible to live for 6 months by yourself, out from civilization, with just the contents of the bag? What do you carry?

What other options are there? What are the correct terms for these activities?

Where do people stay? Which resorts? Do you have to pay to camp there? Do you need any training?

Where do you keep up with your hygienes? Do you carry 6 months worth of water in the pack (I doubt it)? Where is the water supply? Can you shower anywhere?

Where is the food? I've heard of dehydrated meals; does everyone use these? Do you take food from the wild? I'm not looking to go on a hunting trip.

How do you clean your clothes? Or is it traditional to not clean anything?

If you're basically living out there for 6 months, do you set up camp at one spot and return every night or keep moving?

I'm not very physically fit, but I assumed that I'll eventually mold into this lifestyle. Good assumption? Should I prepare beforehand?

I'm 16 years old and I'm contemplating on doing this after I graduate high school.

I apologize for the lack of organization in this post.

1349358824.0	10xoh7	Help get kids outdoors!	ADKSherpa	11	2	4	"It all started here. Over the last half-decade, the Adirondacks have been our home. They've made us both who we are, and what we want to become. Through hiking, backpacking, climbing and generally being outdoors, we've found our passions, developed our goals, and set a course for the rest of our lives. We've forged and solidified friendships and we know now, better than ever before, what it truly means to trust. We’ve tested ourselves both mentally and physically against the strongest of all forces: mother nature, and learned the arts of working with her. The outdoors have taught us self-reliance, determination, and hard work. And for all that, we’re finally getting our chance to give back.

**Over the course of three weeks next summer, we will be following an epic 200+ mile route, bisecting the entirety of the Adirondack Park, south to north, blue line to *blue line*…**

Our expedition will be used to gain support and raise awareness for  a Colorado-based charity called Big City Mountaineers. BCM transforms the lives of under-resourced youth from cities like Denver and San Francisco through outdoor and wilderness mentoring programs, teaching them valuable life skills and broadening their horizons. We’ll be raising money for BCM thr0ugh their main fundraising program, Summit For Someone which will, after raising our pledged amount, allow us to head west later in the summer to climb Mount Rainier.

Climbing Rainier will complete the circle we’ve been working our way around for the past five years. Advancing to the next step in our outdoor careers, mountaineering, while allowing some of the kids that need it most to have the opportunity to experience all that we have, and to learn all that we’ve been able to.

**Stay tuned [here](http://www.adirondacktraverse.org) to follow our progress in fundraising and during the expedition. Please help us reach our goal and help us spread the outdoors by supporting Big City Mountaineers and helping to support our Traverse and our climb next summer. Any donation you can make will be greatly appreciated by us, BCM, and the thousands of at-risk youth that you will be introducing to the wilderness and giving one of the greatest gifts possible.**

We’ll see you on the trail this summer!

I'm looking to spend between 8k and 11k. The ideal vehicle would get decent (20mpg+) gas mileage when I'm driving around town, have AWD or 4WD, and be able to hold a good amount of gear. I'll be using it mostly for snowboard, climbing, and backpacking trips. A bonus would be room enough to sleep two people in the back. 

My initial thoughts are a Subaru Outback or a small SUV like a Honda CRV. A small truck (like a Toyota Tundra) with a shell on the back could be an option, but I'm not stoked on that.

My main concern is I have not been in that part of the country before (Yosemite and the Sierra Nevadas). Any advice? The trip is July 13-August 7th. Resupply points are Red's Meadow and Muir trail Ranch. We are starting at Glacier Point and exiting at Whitney Portal. Planning on doing 10 mile days with 2 rest days in the beginning to acclimatize to the elevation. We have 2 more days to rest which we'll use after the Muir trail Ranch as we will be carrying the most weight on this leg of the journey. Any suggestions, pointers, tips, hacks?

Gear wise we have:
* Whisperlite Internationale Stoves
* MSR Hyperflow filter 
* REI Quarterdome Plus Tents 
* 25 degree synthetic sleeping bags 
* minimal clothing though everything is lightweight UPF 50+ 
* Rain Gear 
* Lightweight 800 fill Goose down puffys 
* Midweight Hiking Boots 
* A full trauma First Aid Kit (2 of us have WEMT certs) 
* 2 Nalgenes each 
* 50 ft. of Cordellete 
* Compasses and detailed topo maps 
* Permits 
* Food (2 lbs/per person per day)
* Total Pack weight 36 Lbs (43 lbs starting off after the resupply at the Muir trail ranch as it is a 10 resupply)

Am I missing anything? Does anyone have any ideas, suggestions?

Burns31	6	1	4	"I've been using a Dakine Mission backpack for about 6+ years now and it's starting to form some sizable holes in the bottom that stuff can fall out of.

So far I am considering the [Oakley Kitchen Sink](http://www.amazon.com/Oakley-Mens-Kitchen-Sink-Backpack/dp/B003XIHZXG) and the [North Face Surge 2](http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12516304&amp;cp=.18811696) but any other suggestions are welcome.

1374008016.0	1iftlh	Finding boots, with a history of ankle problems?	5lunches	4	0	4	"Hey guys. I'll make a long story shortish.

TL;DR: I busted up my ankles long ago. Everything but my running shoes causes ankle pain. Should I get boots or stick with running shoes for backpacking?

Full story:

Three years ago I try to jump across something and land terribly. My ankles are severely sprained. I keep trying to ""run through it"" (I'm an idiot) for a while until I finally end up taking several months off.

I run a lot, ankle pain comes and goes, but I start doing exercises, it gets less frequent.

Then I get a new pair of running shoes. Pain goes away almost 100%. Realize that wearing my sneakers or work shoes causes ankle pain. Awesome!

I did a weekend backpacking trip in my beloved running shoes, everything was fine. But I'm launching a longer trip soon.

So, questions.

Should I get boots, or stick to my running shoes?

If I get boots, what type should I get? There's lots of running stores with people familiar with various ailments, but are there any stores that have the same for boots?

Any thoughts or advice is appreciated!"	t5_2qj57	True

I'm in great shape, but not heavily trained at any of these things.

I have some airline miles that are going to expire, so I thought I might take a few days and go somewhere alone to do something fun outdoors. Does r/outdoors have any suggestions? For example, I was thinking of climbing Mount Washington (NH) or Mount Katadhin (ME), but those seem perhaps a little ambitious for my level of experience.

I'm flying out of DC, and I can only take a few days, so East of the Mississippi is probably best.

My bro is graduating college soon and I wanted to get him something nice to mark the occassion. And while I know he is into outdoors stuff, not being one myself I dont really know a lot about it. Also, his outdoors interests seem to change every year or two; he was really into biking for a couple of years (still does), then snowboarding and now hiking. 

So not knowing much about outdoor sports and wanting to avoid something like a giftcard, I figured a good gift idea was to get him something along the lines of a lifetime membership to REI so that he can use it as his interests change. But according to thier website, lifetime memberships are $20, so that really isnt a great choice (and he might already have that anyway since it's so inexpensive).

Is there any gifts that you guys would suggest for an all-around outdoors person? Is there some websites that I should be looking at since all I seem to know about is REI? What kind of stuff would you as an outdoors person want to get for graduation?

Mostly thusfar I have been looking at the website of each national park I visit and figuring out what the best place is, but it seems inefficient. Each site is a bit different, and finding sites to stay at in between on longer driving days is a huge pain. Most of the websites I have found of nation-wide campsite databases are rv-centric or only cover a certain category of site (KOA, etc). 

It'd be great to just be able to search by location or map, and find  information, reviews, maybe even pictures by and for tent-campers and hikers. 

Is there any sort of croudsourced data-hub like this? Or am I stuck looking at national park to national park from scratch every time?

I'm newer to paddlesports (drunk floating the Illinois River with 100 times more beer than people doesn't really count) and I'm not really finding a whole lot of good recommendations from people who are in to what I am.  So, I guess here's a little about what I'm looking for...

First, I'm 6'2, slight of build (maybe 140 at my lightest, 160 at most muscle mass).

I'm not a fisherman and will never fish out of the boat.  I need a boat that I can solo or tandem with my girlfriend (who is even more green than me) and/or my German Shepherd (who loves the water).  I am primarily interested in class I or II rapids but would like to be able to do a little bit of everything in it (I know no one boat is perfect at everything, but this is probably my 1st of many boats).  I'm a camper and plan to do some trips (mostly weekend warrior stuff, but I want to do some up to 4 or 5 days with other people more experienced than me).  I'm used to car camping, bike camping, and a little backpacking and would like to get some of the benefits of the first 2 with the nature of the last one.  I also like to swim, and like some of the hybrid yaks and SOT's because you can get back in from the water and use them as swimming platforms.

I don't mind a learning curve and am an avid outdoorsman and biker, so don't hold back on mentioning a boat that may be slightly difficult to handle if you feel it might be better for me in the long run.

As far as paddles go, I do really like double-bladed paddles, and would almost prefer a canoe that worked ok with those as well as learning the J-stroke etc. 

I'd prefer not to spend over $2,000 dollars including accessories, but am open to suggestions.

Boats I've considered: Nucanoe, Native Ultimate 14.5, Wilderness Systems Commando 14 (not tandem though), Old Town Penobscot 16 rx, Old Town Charles River RX, Liquid Logic remix xp 9 (for single use someday), and would consider any others

tl;dr: Looking for advice on getting into paddlesports and listed my interests for details, don't bother reading unless you think you can help (I'd hate to waste your time).

Sometimes her fingers feel like ice to me. So one of the things I am getting her for Christmas is a pair of super warm mitts to keep her fingers together cause gloves don't seem to keep her hands warm well.
    
    
So I was at EMS last night and I purchased a pair of the [Arctic Insulated Mitts](http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3651736) in a small...which should fit her. I also looked at the [MARMOT Cirque 3 in 1 Mitts](http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3995817) and a few others including an OR pair, can't remember which though.
    
    
None seemed to compare to the fill in the Altitude mitts... however, after getting them home I realized a possible error of my ways...they're not waterproof, or even resistant. Would I be better off looking for a pair of water resistant/proof ones? or is there something I can spray these with to at least help out a little. They will be used for snowshoeing and winter hikes.

I've never been on a boat trip but I am in good physical condition and will be traveling with experienced people.

What kind of things should I prepare for?  What kind of gear should I bring that I wouldn't have otherwise thought of?  Any good general advice for me?

1283862351.0	dal22	North Face Apex Bionic - Thoughts?		1	0	4	"Not sure if this is an appropriate question for this subreddit, but I thought I'd throw it out there.


I'm looking for a jacket.  A jacket that's wind- and water-resistant (if not -proof), looks pretty cool, isn't too bulky, and costs a reasonable sum of money (preferably under $100, though I might be able to budget $150 - the Apex Bionic I'd buy would be the 2009 style/colors, to save some $, so that's always an option for other jackets as well).  Oh, and is available for purchase online (in a size L, probably, that's the size of my Khumbu).  


I need it for tooling around [the climate of Rochester, NY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_ny#Geography_and_climate) this fall and into the winter (last year my TNF Khumbu was usually all I needed, sometimes I would have to bust out the ski parka on bad days, bumping up the wind-resistance is really important), waiting for the bus, walking home from work, hiking around parks, and hopefully the occasional camping trip.


I bought my boyfriend The North Face Apex Bionic for our anniversary, and I love the damn thing.  I don't necessarily want to get the exact same thing as him and be all matchy-matchy.  So, any suggestions for a reasonably comparable jacket, so we don't end up looking like tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum?


*Thanks /r/Outdoors, I'm off to peruse you a bit more, I didn't even know you existed until now!* :D  Frontpaged!


**TL;DR:  Any suggestions for a wind- and water-resistant soft shell jacket for the ladies, that is comparable to The North Face Apex Bionic?  Or is that the best out there?**"	t5_2qj57	True

I've been looking around and there seems to be a massive array of features and watches available.

The functions I actually need are stopwatch(with lap times), altimeter, time. 

I do a bit of mountaineering in Europe and some fell races around the UK, the primary use being Mountain Marathons, 2 day fell races with navigation. Knowing your altitude is a huge help when trying to find a check point in heavy cloud.

Any thoughts on other functions which could be useful? Obviously as I want to use it in races with navigation in GPS is not allowed.

I don't need anything super heavy duty because I live in the Rockys and only hike in summer (when it's usually hot and dry).
