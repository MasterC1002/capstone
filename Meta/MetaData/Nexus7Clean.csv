Just stuck Paranoid Android 2.14 on it and it is lovely.  Next step (when I have time) is to add Jay's buttery goodness.  I'm looking for some decent wallpapers, not having a lot of luck so far.  I saw some pictures of the PA wallpapers but so far haven't actually been able to find the images to use.

Next step is to hunt for my 360 controller, use my OTG cable and try and get some games going on it.

Anyone else have a fully functional, working Nexus 7 who is happy with it?

1352219487.0	12qhke	How I permanently fixed my screen lifting...		290	55	69	"Sorry for the giant wall of text, but its worth the read if you want a pain free fix, that doesn't modify your device at all.


I have a 16gb N7, that I pre-ordered when it was announced and have had it since day 1. And, also since day 1, it has had the screen lifting issue. Like most others, my screen lifting only happens on the left side.

So for a while I would take the back cover off, use a really small phillips head to tighten all the screws, and let that sit for a couple of weeks, before I did it again.

While that did kinda fix the screen lift, that wasn't really the root of the problem. Half of the time the screen lift would come back, and the screws weren't even re-loosened. It seemed to be a bad glue problem rather than a loose screw problem.


But after a lot of intense inspection of my device, every time I opened it up, combined with a lot of research online, I was confident I had narrowed down the problem to one thing.


Specifically, this thing right [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/QeT0e.jpg)


For those who haven't opened up their N7, there is a black ribbon with a rectangle of black foam padding glued to it. That ribbon is simply too long. It curves up too high, bulges up and out. You can kinda see what I mean in this picture [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/rqOs9.jpg)



Plus, it doesn't help that it goes even higher up, because of that rectangle foam padding they glued to it. For a while I really contemplated just tearing off that foam pad and seeing if that stopped it from pushing the screen up. But I didn't want to damage anything, or start tearing shit out.


I could push down on that black ribbon, and hear the exact same squeaking noise I would hear with the back cover on, when I press on the screen. So I knew that ribbon was exactly what was causing the noise, and the pressure that pushed the screen back up every time I pushed it down.


So basically I wanted to make that ribbon shorter, and NOT push up against the back of the device. But I wanted to do this without damaging anything at all, or modifying my device. So I came up with an idea of how to push the ribbon down, essentially folding it under itself, so it wouldn't take up as much room.


So, below are the steps to do this, with pictures along the way:


1) Get a [Q-tip](http://www.malestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/q-tip.jpg?9d7bd4)




2) Cut the ends off, so it you are left with the center stick, looks like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/U8G1p.jpg)




3) Take off the back of your N7. (I used my finger nail to pull it off, but something like a guitar pick will work great. It's really easy to remove, and don't worry about damaging internal components while removing it, because its not connected to the rest of the device with any wires or anything. You wont hurt your N7 by taking off the back cover.)




4) Locate the ribbon that is causing all of the squeaking and excess pressure on the screen. Right [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/QeT0e.jpg)




5) Put the q-tip stick in the space to the right of the ribbon, like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/Em6kO.jpg). Keep in mind, because the black ribbon is too long, it will push the stick out. I pressed it down in the gap with my finger like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/TIron.jpg).





6) Replace the back cover. Voila! You are done!





The q-tip stick takes up the excess empty space that used to be there. The space that the black ribbon USED TO flex down into, when you pushed the screen down with your fingers. Since the black ribbon has no room to go anywhere, and its being folded under itself (slightly), it makes the pressure consistent, on the back and front of the device, so there is no more wiggle room what so ever. The screen cannot be pushed up or down anymore at all.


So there it is. That's how I permanently fixed my screen lift, without risking any damage to the device. I've had the q-tip stick inside my N7 for over 3 weeks now, and it has completely fixed it. My device feels way more solid now, I can squeeze on the screen anywhere and nothing budges at all, no squeaks, no lifting, nothing. Hopefully this will be able to help some of you out.


**EDIT**: Also I forgot to mention this fix is very easy to undo, if you want to take it out of there. It's a non-permanent method to give you a permanent fix. You simply take off the back cover, and the q-tip stick will fall right out. No tape or glue or anything is used, so its not stuck in there. That way if you have to send the device in to ASUS or Google, you can easily take out the stick.

**EDIT 2**: One more thing. You can cut the Q-tip to be the perfect length so it fits snugly between the 2 screws on either end. This will make it hold itself in place, and hold the ribbon down, as long as you cut it the right length. If its too short, the black ribbon will just push it out."	t5_2ucrx	True

I ordered a Nexus7 from Google and as soon as I received it I noticed that the speaker was defective. I called Google and they said sure, send it back and we'll get you a new one out to you - but we'll have to place $250.00 on your credit card on hold. My other option was to send it to ASUS. I sent it to ASUS a month ago. Turns out that after getting the run around from them for 3 weeks they lost my device. Then they found my device but informed me that they will be keeping my device for refurbishment and that I should contact Google for a replacement or refund. I did just that. I went through many layers of support with both companies. Google finally said to me...""Sorry, you sent it to ASUS. It's out of our hands. Take it up with them. You should have just sent it to us."" Exact words from the Google Play Device Level 2 support rep. I can't contact ASUS directly because all I get are customer service reps which tell me that they can't help me - I need to contact Google instead. I really want some advice on what I should do. I'm out ~$300.00 and no device. My card company declined my dispute because I didn't buy it from ASUS and they have possession of my device. There is no one at ASUS who can do anything for me. I requested my device to be sent back to me but they can't do that because my ASUS RMA number has already been removed. My device is no longer being tracked. I'm upset and lost on what I should be doing about this. Any suggestions or how else I should approach this? It's been a nightmare dealing with both companies. "	t5_2ucrx	True

EDIT: Deleted the alternate user accounts I had created for my roommates and disabled the Currents background syncing as suggested. Going to see if that improved stability any.

EDIT: **UPDATE (Fixed?)** So it has now been 24 hours and my tablet is running more zippier and smoother then I recall it running ever before. It feels like a whole new machine. I've had no reboots or hangs, either. I did this by following advice found in this thread: Disable Google Current's background syncing option, delete my extra User Accounts from the tablet, and ran [Forever Gone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kovit.p.forevergone&amp;hl=en) on the tablet. 

**NOTE** I am aware that this is likely a software bug and that Google will fix it in time. However, I received a replacement Nexus 7 only about a week ago to fix my old ones borked speaker. I posted this just to find out if other people were having the same problem, IE: an issue with the software, or if it was something wrong with my new tablet.

I have MD as mentioned, and have limited... everything. Use of hands very little. I sat through the years of iPad, iPad2, iPad3, and other tablets that were all too big and awkward for my small weak hands. I also had nothing in my price range. Enter Nexus 7. I finally had $200 and picked one up in March so school would be easy and so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop everywhere. Let's just say this was a great decision. Holy cow! this is awesome! I actually get stuff done and socialize more since I don't struggle to type as much. A few things that make it special are:
- Screen size. Awesome. Nice for work and pleasure. Goes where I go. 
- Large bezel. I know this is a huge complaining point, but it is a good handrest for my contracted wrists and fingers. Big plus. 
- Google Keyboard. Predictive text is a lifesaver for fatigue and keeps me going fast. 

I don't think Google would expect a product to benefit people like me so much. I am pleased and will always have a good reason to use this thing. I think I may start suggesting this one to others.

1.  Nexus 7 seems to slow down to a crawl when the hard drive is filled.  I bought a cheap OTG cable and plugged in a 64gb thumb drive for media I wanted to watch when bored.  The OTG cable was also great for uploading pictures to dropbox/facebook.  Had to buy the Nexus Media Importer App in order to get everything to work properly.

2.  Trip Advisor Apps!  Quick and summarized source of information about the majority of my destinations.  Woke up a couple of the mornings quite hungover and in no mood to do the early morning walking tour.  Instead used the walking tours included in the App itself.  The GPS was fairly accurate and pointed us in the right direction the majority of the times.  The restaurant reviews were also helpful but its hard to say if we dodged any bullets by avoiding certain restaurants.  Even found a couple cool destinations off the beaten path.

3.  Headphone splitter as well as a good reading app.  I prefer Moon+ Reader.

4.  Google Now has really improved since I have got back.  Having it point out great picture opportunities would have been great.  However, it still showed currency exchange rates, time back home and city information.

5.  Offline Google Maps.  Could have been a lifesaver if I really had gotten really lost.

6.  All these great options on top of all the regular daily apps I use; Chrome, Currents, uT.  I was very happy with my purchase just before going.  The BB Playbook would have been useless by comparison.

Feel free to add suggestions!

PS.. Nobody knew what the N7 was.  Everyone was asking if it was some sort of mini iPad.  It wasn't until I was getting on the shuttle bus at the Paris airport was it correctly identified as a N7 by an elderly couple.  I was quite blown away.

oday is exactly 4 weeks since i lost my Nexus 7 16gb in the seatback pocket of a United airlines flight. I honestly thought it was lost forever and that i would never see it again. Spent the 1st 2 weeks checking lookout and trying to locate the device, but it had never connected to it since i lost it. United contacted me last week (3 weeks lost) asking for a description again and address. Well 2 days later they sent me a tracking number without ever calling or confirming it was my N7. I had no idea if they were sending me my tablet, someone elses, or just any tablet at all since they never confirmed anything, especially since they said it was found in Texas. I am glad to say my flawless N7 arrived today and it is in fact my exact N7. The cheap sleeve seem to hold up (was worried it would arrive with a cracked screen).

http://www.ebay.com/itm/h259-Wireless-Bluetooth-Aluminum-Keyboard-Stand-Case-For-Google-ASUS-NEXUS-7-/400329363627?ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:CA:3160

It goes by a few names and part numbers depending on where you buy it from. I got this one from Ebay for $24.99 including shipping from Hong Kong.

It comes with a 4 page Engrish manual that basically tells you to turn Bluetooth on in your Tablet and pair it.

It has an On/Off switch and goes into standby &lt;60 days&gt; for a total off 55 hours of usage between chargings. It does not come with a cable.

If I didn't know better, I would say it was manufactured by the same guys who built the N7. The construction and finish are identical to the N7. 

Pic album: http://imgur.com/a/TaSOm

The keyboard is a comfortable size and the keys and Bluetooth work well. I like the Home key but not the missing Tab key. 

Originally I wanted it as a case and stand that I could use @ WiFi coffee shops etc. on my daily travels. For me however, I think it will be a better home/office dock than a portable case as I have a nice leather one from Oberon that was originally for my Kindle 3.

TyrionLannister2012	117	41	36	"So last night I go to use my Nexus 7 - 16gb (it's been working normally thus far), and the touchscreen is completely unresponsive. I tried an infinite amount of resets, screen switching on and off, charging, leaving it unplugged, letting it sit overnight. Nothing. (The entire touchscreen not just the right side as some report). The real bitch of it is, the store I got it from had no more in stock and they are the only place in town carrying them. Super sad day for me, I was loving my first tablet. Has anyone else had a similar experience/issue?


EDIT: Not sure why people are downvoting. I'm not bashing the Nexus 7, you'll note I absolutely loved mine. I was just curious if it was a localized issue or if it was common.

We really like the way that this sub is growing and maturing into an awesome community. However, we have decided on some new measures to make the community even better. 

**1. All shipping/delivery related issues are to be posted in the Shipping and Delivery thread.**

This is to ensure that people can still talk about their respective delivery times on their own thread. Be aware that any new posts regarding shipping or delivery **will** be marked as spam.

**2. Any future RMA/Defective device related issues are to be posted in the Defective Nexus 7 thread to be added to the sidebar shortly.**

Again, this is to remove too many self posts from clouding the sub. Any future posts not placed in this thread **will** be marked as spam.


*Everything else regarding the N7 can be submitted to the subreddit like any other sub. It's just that shipping and RMA posts have recently been flooding the spam filter and have been large in quantity. So those types of posts are going to be moved into threads, so they aren't constantly in the spam filter. That way the sub has more news about using the device instead of issues regarding shipping or defects.*


**3. Calling all developers/accessory vendors/etc.!!**

Anyone who is willing to contribute to the community through N7 optimized apps, N7 accessories, or anything else, please contacts the mods about it. You might just show up on the sidebar of /r/Nexus7! As you can see, Mobile Fun, an accessory vendor, has already considered giveaways and other fun events for the members of /r/Nexus7. Anyone interested, let us know.

So as you can see, we are working diligently to make /r/Nexus7 a better place for everyone. I would like to thank the other mods for being so open-minded and helping this sub become a better place for all N7 owners. At over 5000 readers, we are making great strides.

Thank you for reading and please upvote this post so all members of /r/Nexus7 can see it. This post will also be in the sidebar for easy access. Thanks again :)

1346288670.0	z1vij	Complete Guide to rooting and installing ROMs on your Nexus 7	driscoll42	90	20	51	"**1. Get the Nexus 7 ready**

Go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Developer Options and enable [""USB debugging"".](http://i.imgur.com/OOtEH.png)

**1a. Install the Android SDK** - (OPTIONAL - You don't need this, but it could be useful if you run into issues and need to debug)

This lets your computer communicate with your Nexus 7 through the command line. The download link can be found [here](http://bit.ly/3jNWwL). I installed all the Extras, Android 4.0, 4.0.3, and 4.1, and the Tools. You certainly don't need all of those but I erred on the side of caution. (Be sure to choose ""Approve All"")

**2. Setup your computer**

Download [Nexus 7 Toolkit](http://goo.gl/xVsaF) (v2.0 at time of writing) and install. Then choose ""1. Install/Uninstall Google Nexus 7 Drivers on your PC."" (by pressing 1 and enter). Pick your OS and wait for it to finish installing. [Main Menu](http://i.imgur.com/Wp6LT.png)

**3. Backup Tablet**

With your Nexus 7 on and in ADB mode (that is the mode where you normally use the tablet) plug it into your computer. Make sure the Toolkit recognizes your Nexus by going to the main menu and you should have under ADB Mode at the top see some kind of numbers/letters under it. If not choose ""23. Refresh Main Menu"". If you don't see it, your Nexus is probably off or you didn't install the drivers.

Now ""2. Backup and Restore your Tablet"" Follow the on screen instructions in the toolkit and Nexus to fully backup your tablet.

**4. Unlock Bootloader/Root/Custom Recovery**

Once your Nexus is fully backed up reboot it into Fastboot (You do this by holding down the volume up AND volume down and the power button while turning it on, [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/F97LU.jpg). 

Check to make sure the Toolkit recognizes you are in Fastboot in the Main menu (refresh the menu, 23). Then enter in ""8. 1-CLICK FOR ALL"" and follow the on screen instructions. After that you should now have a stock Nexus with root and recovery (I recommend TWRP). 

**4a. Recovery**

If you already rooted your Nexus 7 reboot into Fastboot but choose ""6. Rename Recovery Restore Files"", follow on screen instructions, then ""7. Flash Custom Recovery [CWM Touch, TWRP Touch or Stock]"" and follow the on screen instructions.

You may want to stop after this step. At this point you have not made any radical changes to the Nexus 7, it's a pure JB experience, just with root and recovery. From here on I will be going on deviating from stock.

**4b. ALTERNATE METHOD**

Instead of using the Toolkit you can instead use the Android SDK and ADB to unlock the bootloader, root, and install a custom recovery. To do so check out [this guide](http://bit.ly/LlOPJp)

**5. ROM, Kernel, and Gapps**

(Note: If you want to be EXTRA careful, download [AFV](http://bit.ly/LNlXJu) and check the MD5 sumcheck of every file. I never had an issue, but it's probably worth the five minutes to make sure you don't brick your Nexus. This applies to the kernel, ROM, Gapps, anything you're flashing)

Download the ROM and kernel of your choosing, I chose [CM10](http://bit.ly/OAwFVG) and [Trinity kernel](http://bit.ly/Ry1LBN) (Others can be found on the [XDA Forums](http://bit.ly/MdvtXS) or [RootzWiki](http://bit.ly/SL4A1k)). Place the .zip files (DO NOT EXTRACT) onto your Nexus, I put them in the Download folder just for the sake of convenience but anywhere on the sdcard should work.

You also need to download [Gapps](http://goo.im/gapps/) (Use the table or be sure to sort by Modification Time for the latest for 4.1.1). Due to legal reasons, Google apps can't be bundled with the ROMS and have to be installed seperately. 

Included apps: Google Play, Syncing, Phone, Voice Search, Setup, Search Bar, Gallery, Backip, One Time Initializer (mostly crucial behind the scenes apps). 

Not Included: Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Navigation, Street View, Books, Movies, Earth, Goggles, Music, Drive, Reader, Voice, Chrome (You'll have to download these yourself from the Play Store)

Reboot into the Fastboot Mode and use the volume buttons to navigate to Recovery Mode and then use the power button to boot into Recovery. [TWRP looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/sQ1gQ.jpg)

Now choose ""Wipe"". To be safe I do a Factory Reset and wipe the Dalvik Cache, Cache, and System. Once finished go to ""Install"" and find your ROM. Then ""Add More Zips"" and get your kernel, do it agaain for Gapps. Then ""Swipe to Confirm Flash"" and let it run.

**NOTE:** It can take several minutes to boot up, up to five or ten the first time. This is normal. Subsuequent boot ups are fine.

You now have a custom ROM and Kernel!

And just to wrap it all up, [this is what my final About phone looks like](http://i.imgur.com/PRA5q.png). You'll see that it's 4.1.1, Trinity kernel, and CM 10.


**5a. Restore Apps**

Note: You'll probably need to reenable USB Debugging as in the first step again now that you've wiped the system.

If you backed up the Nexus in the Toolkit, plug in your Nexus (in ADB Mode) and choose ""2. Backup and Restore your Nexus"" then ""2. Restore a Backup to your Nexus"" and follow the onscreen instructions.

**5b. Kernel Tweaks**

To make your life easier, I highly recommend you download [franco.Kernel Updater](http://bit.ly/w7CXO2) if you're using franco. These just make it easier to mess with your kernel.

**6. Bootscreen**

**CAUTION:** I don't know 100% for sure that this still works. I believe it will since the GNexus and Nexus 7 have the same resolution. But JB might have changed something or it just might not work. If someone could verify for me I'll edit this as need be.

First off choose the one you desire ([here are some](http://bit.ly/JX2nt0) though I chose a [LCARS boot](http://bit.ly/LDqTnW) but I am designing my own at the moment) and download it onto your computer. The download [Empty_CWM_BootanimationZIP_Flashable.zip](http://bit.ly/KvHVyY) (taken from [this XDA thread](http://bit.ly/N3l8lf)). Don't extract that file, rather drag and drop your desired bootanimation.zip into the /data/local directory in the zip file. Delete the readmes and flash it onto the Nexus like you did the ROM/kernel.

**7. Keeping Up to Date**

While the best way to keep up to date with ROMs is to watch the boards, for a bit less maintenance I recommend [GooManager](http://bit.ly/U4N9IO). Most popular ROMs are stored on their servers and your phone will let you know when there is an update. Download the update, [download the latest Gapps](http://i.imgur.com/rZtVR.png), download a kernel if you wish, [sort them](http://i.imgur.com/o6jnz.png) (ROM-&gt;Gapps-&gt;Kernel-&gt;Other), be sure to set it to wipe cache/dalvik cache partition, then hit ""Flash"". Note: You NEED custom revcovery, preferably TWRP.

Goo Manager can even keep your Recovery up to date. [Press the three dots in the top right corner](http://i.imgur.com/ZsH6N.png) and you'll get a drop down menu. Choose ""Install OpenRecoveryScript"" and follow the on screen instructions. If your custom recovery has an update, it'll update it!

---

**Revert to Stock**

**CAUTION** This will wipe EVERYTHING, even what's on your SD card. Backup anything you want to save.

There are four things you must do, reinstall stock ROM, reflash stock recovery, unroot, and lock the bootloader. Download and flash [the stock ROM](http://bit.ly/JvTq9k) (same as the ROM in step 5, wipe cache/delvik/factory reset). Then reboot into Fastboot and open up the Toolkit. With your Nexus attached choose ""6. Flash Recovery"" and follow the on screen instructions for stock. Once finished, in the main menu of the Toolkit choose ""3. UnLock or Re-Lock your Bootloader"" and follow the on screen instructions for ReLock. Once finished you now have a stock Nexus 7 again!

---

Also for the CPU Governors (Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Performance), I was a bit confused by what they all did, so here's a general [Android CPU Governers](http://bit.ly/xY9ba9) and if you're curious [some more governors which aren't included and other kernel info](http://bit.ly/vidtgW). Be sure to set your Maximum CPU Frequency to 1600 MHz! (Note: to save your OC and chosen Governor you mus check ""Set on Boot""

Please give me any feedback, criticism, steps I may have skipped or other ideas to make this better. Or unneeded steps, pretty sure I don't need to wipe as much as I did, but I preferred to be safe.

1352307139.0	12syrh	My first week with my Nexus 7...	monkeyboyhero	90	27	50	"I got my Nexus 7 a week ago, my first Android device ever.  I own an iPad and an iPhone, so I thought people who were thinking of taking the plunge might be interested in how I've found it.

1) The freedom offered by Android is incredible.  I've downloaded emulators (and ROMS), MX Player is free and plays almost any format (no converting like when I want to put something on my iPad) and access to the file system is extremely helpful.  I connected my NES emulator to my Wiimote in seconds, and it didn't take any ""hacking"" or messing around.

2) Browsing the web - Chrome is a really nifty browser, and the Incognito mode works really well for *ahem* gift buying.  Shame it doesn't have a full screen option though.  But of course, you can install other browsers AND make them the default!

3) Speed - I have a first gen iPad, so it was sloooow when doing pretty much anything.  Nexus 7 is super-fast in comparison

4) Task switching - the ability to zip between open apps is very nicely implemented.

5) The aesthetics - the look of the Nexus 7 is really nice, the back especially.  Feels like a much more expensive device.

There are a couple of negative things too: 

1) Apps - it can be hard to judge which apps are best at times, and some don't feel as professional as Apple apps

2) Google applications - a great by and large, but there are annoyances.  You can't change the calendar after an event is created, you have to make an entirely new event. 

EDIT: Sorry, I wasn't clear here.  I meant - I have several calendars (one for appointments, one for personal reminders etc).  If I create an event in personal reminders, I can't then swap it to appointments.  I'd have to create an entirely new event.  

 Not a big deal, but I CAN do that with my iPhone - I feel Google stuff should work as well as if not better then an iPhone on their own OS.  Similarly, Gmail sometimes shows you have an unread message when you don't.  Easy to fix, but shouldn't have to.

3) Speech recognition - not a massive deal, but I think Siri recognises words better than the Nexus.  

Overall though, I am really pleased with my device.  I think it's a wonderful piece of kit, and am very glad I bought it over an iPad Mini!

My N7 case arrived in the mail today and I have to say, it's a pretty nice case. I ordered the grey one but there's a multitude of colours from which to choose.

It's slim, low profile, and the cover has the sleep/wake function. The cover material is similar to the smart covers for the iPad and the inside of the cover is a microfiber-type material. The case snaps right on, fits snugly, and all the ports are cut out well. The flap is magnetized as well so when the cover is closed, the flap snaps shut along the back.

All in all, great cover and for $15 and free shipping, I'm going to go back and get some more colours.

For those that are interested, I ordered it off of eBay here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=150870765928&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:CA:3160

EDIT: It appears that the guy I bought it off of (link above) has sold out of the cases. I found another seller that seems to sell identical cases here: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Smart-Ultra-Thin-Spider-PU-leather-PC-back-Stand-Case-For-Google-Nexus-7-10-colo-/150874018168?pt=US_Tablet_Accessories&amp;hash=item2320cad178

So, it's Christmas time, everyone's buying each-other cruddy little gifts that will last (at a maximum) 5 minutes before shattering into smithereens. My girlfriend arrives at my house and says ""Whoah when did you get that? It's so cool! It must have cost a fortune!"" (referring to my Nexus 7). I reply to her ""I bought it in Edion, they're 20,000 Yen (200 euros). She replies ""but you only get 15,000 Yen a week, you've got 10,000 to live off for two whole weeks! That's insane!"".
My response is ""I'm willing to make the sacrifice to live off shitty food for 2 weeks to get this, it's not just a tablet, not just some useless piece of tech that I picked up because I felt like it. This is something I can learn a great deal from. This is a tool, this is something that I can quickly access dictionaries, translations, books and academic writings, I will use this to further my education!...and read Reddit and play poker from the comfort of my bed!""

Needless to say she wasn't impressed, she then came over to my house a few days later with...her own brand new Nexus 7....


The sheer awe-factor of these great little tablets is amazing. I feel proud in knowing that the tablet I bought and have sacrificed for is an object of quality, made to serve users with specs that rival many 600$ laptops (y'know, those pseudo-laptop dual core TI-82's with the shiny screens). I bought this tablet not because of aesthetics, or because of simplicity or convenience, but because this tablet is the absolute pinnacle of ultra-mobile computing at a price that blows its competition out of the market!

1368901271.0	1el5yr	Fixing a lagging stock Nexus 7 running Android 4.2.2 (share your tips, tricks and experiences)	ddfall	62	14	53	"I've got a 32GB Nexus 7 w/HSPA+ running stock Android 4.2.2. The 4.2.2 update did wonders for battery life, but has utterly killed performance on my tablet and those of a few friends. I've read that clearing the cache and [disabling Currents](http://www.droidbeans.com/how-to-fix-nexus-7-lag-issue/) helps a lot, but this did very little in my case. So for those who have encountered this problem before, I'm wondering:

* What did you do to optimise your Nexus 7? I would like to avoid rooting and prefer to keep everything stock.

* What tips would you give to those with laggy devices?

* Is one way of restoring a Nexus 7 better than another? If so, please elaborate as to why.

* While we wait for a new Nexus 7, what have you done to extend the life of your device?

* If you tried some things but still got no result, share what you tried so we can narrow down possible options?

*Note: Yes, I've done some searching already. I'm hoping that someone found something I've missed and will share their experiences.*  **Please don't down vote this post if you don't care. Just move on and let others discuss this. Thanks!**

Edit: Regarding ways to restore, I know of three: [Reset from settings, wipe data/factory reset](https://support.google.com/nexus/7/answer/2668187?hl=en-GB), and re-flashing it from the [factory image](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#nakasig). Other than techniques, does the final result vary in any way?

AbramsLullaby	62	16	31	"My all time favorite boot animation on my S2 and Evo was a mock bios POST from an old motherboard (The ones that had ENERGY STAR on the top right and tested ram and displayed a POST). It brought back warm fuzzy nostalgia feelings from my first computers.

Anyways, because no one has made one yet for the N7, I decided to have a go. The specs on the post screen were as accurate as I could make them :) I made it show in landscape since I have the N7 in landscape 99% of the time. It's *not* flashable, so use a root explorer to put it in the /system/media folder.

For anyone curious, I used the application 'boot animation factory'. It's a windows program that worked flawlessly.

The other mods and I have been discussing how to make this subreddit the best it can be, and **we always want your input**.

We try not to remove posts too often, but a lot of times stuff gets stuck in the spam filter so if you've submitted something and it hasn't appeared, just message the mods to let us know.

A while back we proposed some threads to try and make information easier to find, and reduce the number of posts about the same topics such as RMAing for screen issues. It's obviously still a real problem that people are experiencing, and as mentioned we don't want to be too heavy-handed with moderation, but we do want to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high in this community.

You'll find links to those threads in the sidebar. However, it's been pointed out that after a while Reddit will lock older threads, so this isn't a permanent solution. Now we're going to try a different approach:

**tl;dr** There's now a [Nexus 7 Wiki](http://nexus7.wikkii.com/wiki/) - help us build it!

1342209368.0	wikjq	Let's start a petition to have the Google Play store refund Nexus 7 pre-Sale shipping charges.	Captsaicin	113	68	106	"It's not the end of the world to have to wait an extra couple of days for my Nexus 7. However, I do have a problem with is paying a $14 shipping charge to be receive my device later than I would have if I had ordered from a retail store without paying a shipping charge.

I think most people feel duped by Google into ordering from the Play store. I saw some comments in another thread saying Google didn't explicitly say they would be sending our devices first or at least at the same time, but I think it's a reasonable view to at least receive them at the same time. It's ridiculous that Google's biggest fans who ordered the device on 6/27 from Google directly had to pay $14 for shipping (in the U.S., I don't know how much it was in other countries) yet we're receiving our devices after people who ordered from retailers and did not pay shipping. For example, one of my friends who ordered a week after me through Gamestop without shipping charges is receiving his device today. This is embarrassing for Google after they claimed they learned their lessons from the Nexus One launch in 2010.

The default cable wasn't long enough so I picked up a cheap 10' one from Monoprice as I always do.

I didn't pay attention to the gauge of cable I bought because the dumb side of me didn't think 10' distance would matter that much just for charging.

It does.

The first cable I bought was a 28 ga cable and it took over 24 hours to fully charge from 20-30%. I set the dock up somewhere else with the original cable to make sure something didn't happen to my charger or dock (we have a ton of static here with it so dry in the winter). It was fine.

Poked around a bit and decided to try the 24 ga 10' cable from Monoprice. Works like a charm. Charges at a normal rate no problem.

TL;DR: If you need a longer charging cable, try the 24 ga from Monoprice. Otherwise it'll take forever to charge."	t5_2ucrx	True

Cavemencrazy	49	11	39	"I have some experience taking apart phones and tablets, and I decided to take apart my new Nexus 7 Tablet.  I was actually very impressed with how well it was put together.  

The back housing actually comes apart very easily.  As you can see in the video I was able to pop it off using mostly just my finger.  Once it was opened, I could tell that both speakers, the charging port, and battery are all very easily replaceable.  (Replacement parts for phones and tablets usually become readily available about 2-3 months after the tablet comes out.) This is awesome because anyone who has every used a screw driver in their life, can fix their own tablet, instead of forking out 100's of bucks to someone else.

The whole thing can be taken apart with a small Philips head screw driver.  Unlike the iPhones that need a special pentalobe tool and suction cups.  As far as build goes, I would say that Asus took more after Samsung, with the removable charging ports. (HTC seems to think that the charging port is better off attached to the motherboard, which is a horrible decision.  What is usually the first thing to break on an android device besides the screen?  The charging port.  The easier it is to swap the better.  Asus did a good job in that category.)  It is very similar to the GS3, GS4, and the new Nexus Phones. 

Here is the 10 minute video of me doing the tear down/walk through. http://youtu.be/IG6A_RBX-v0

Almost cost me a laptop, and the tips of my fingers are a bit scorched. **Check the temperature of your USB ports when charging from a powered off device**.

[The fix is Post #4 by PhoenixTank, the first Dropbox download file](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?s=7caea3a32b41855dd4f92557304ca8bb&amp;t=2145265).  

Just download the file, go to /system/bin with any root access file explorer, rename the old debuggerd just in case, and move the new ""debuggerd"" file into /system/bin.  This worked for me.  

I'm not 100% sure it's Stickmount, but based on the XDA forums that seems to be only culprit.  

Oh, and to re-try the update, go to Apps -&gt; Google Services Framework -&gt; Clear Data and Force Stop.  Then restart your N7 and it should re-download the update.  "	t5_2ucrx	True

**Launchers** are replacement home screens. You can completely customise your device (whether a N7 or other Android phone or tablet) by replacing altogether the full UI upon which you hang your widgets and app shortcuts. This isn't a live wallpaper, rather an entirely new home page replacement with its own wallpaper, icon sets and other things. There are many on Android Play store, some of the more popular are:

* [GO Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gau.go.launcherex&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5nYXUuZ28ubGF1bmNoZXJleCJd)

1342542412.0	wphda	16GB shipping thread	4stringwizard	39	5	189	"There seems to be alot of comments dotted around various threads showing that some people are having their Nexus's shipped. It seems to be that most of these are 8GB versions and the 16GB aren't making moves yet. This (16GB) would probably be most ordered modelled but there's also talk that a lot of the 16GB's may have been shipped to retailers rather than fulfilling preorders.

So, anyone heard about their 16GB yet? I'm UK, ordered 29th and heard absolutely fuck all since then.

**Edit 1:** 18:35 (GMT). Seems that there's very few 16GB Play orders have been shipped (there are some which do some to have however). Lots of people pissed off at lack of communication.

**Edit 2:** 19:10 (GMT) Seems to be more orders in the US that are getting through from the Play store and other retailers. Other regions seem to still be in the dark. It was mentioned by sinatosk in the comments that a Play store rep may have suggested a technical problem with tracking information and charges at their end in the UK (after a lengthy session on hold). Looks like UK might have to wait til next week :(

**Edit 3:** 20:20 (GMT) These edits are probably unneeded (and the timestamps a bit over the top) but its sometimes useful to summarise what's in the 90-odd comments. Seems a lot of US orders from the first few days of preorder are out for delivery and getting delivered. In other comments there was talk of all US pre-orders before a certain date (about the 29th I think) shipping by today so I'd keep an eye on things. UK still seems to left in the cold and by the looks of things retailers are going to firing them out tomorrow. 

Bare in mind that there's only ~1300 people in this subreddit, and compared to the amount of orders Google is likely to have received its a very small sample size. At least it might give a bit more information than they currently are at the moment however.

**Edit 4:** 21:05 (GMT) Comment from daveyp2tm for those of us in the UK
http://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus7/comments/wphda/16gb_shipping_thread/c5fef7f

Might be seeing some movement soon :)

**Edit 5:** 09:28 (GMT) There seems to be more UK orders that have confirmed to be shipping. Even more US ones, but haven't heard much else about AUS and Canada. You might also want to check [the Play Store shipping page](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2667319&amp;topic=2411735&amp;ctx=topic) for some more information, which they've finally put up.

Don't lose hope yet :). Mine was ordered 29th June, UK, and finally got my shipping confirmation this morning.

Not sure if most of your here follow the [XDA Nexus 7 forums](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1673), but I thought I'd share with you a neat 'hack' I've found there, and successfully installed on my N7 3G.  This is 'experimental' and you need to be rooted.  Because I found it neat and useful, I'm briefly summarizing MultiROM here, but if you are interested in trying it out, please go to the link below:   

**Link to thread &amp; files:** [MultiROM v2 by Tasssadar](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2011403)   

**What it does:**   
MultiROM is a multi-boot solution for Nexus 7. It is not a ROM. It let's you keep your current ROM (be it stock or custom), and allows you to install other ROMs - including Ubuntu - all without the need to wipe your device. This is handy if you want to keep the stock ROM and all your apps, but want to try some other stuff that's out there, like Paranoid Android or Ubuntu etc.  Currently, only ROMs from the internal memory of your device are supported, but there are plans to allow booting from USB!! (exciting I know ;-) )

**How it works**
There are two parts to MultiROM. First, the MultiROM 'hack' that you can flash form recovery. And then a modified recovery (TWRP) which you do have to install via fastboot.  The fastboot was the only 'difficult' step for me, as I suck at command prompt.  I used the Nexus Root Toolkit (which I had already installed on my PC previously to root) to push the modified recovery image through fastboot.   


Hope some of you find this useful, and if you are somewhat interested I recommend reading up more on this in the **[original XDA link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=34577851#post34577851)**   


&gt; **Please note:** *I'm providing this info only as a fan and I am in no way associated with the developer. Also, I urge you to please read all instructions and posts on XDA, make backups and ask questions if you're not sure about something... As I would hate for anyone to brick their devices and blame me for it :P *

What apps allow using a capacitive stylus to take notes with palm detection (so there are no stray marks when you place your hand on the screen)? He uses Evernote as well, so if there are apps that tightly integrate, it will be a plus.

I teach English in Central Asia and I have an idea to use tablets in the classroom. The nexus 7 looks great to me because a.) the price b.) android 4 c.) google books and d.) the size. I'll be working with ESL students mostly, so the idea of having tons of easily accessible English-language books is great. Also being able to customize the tablets with Android 4 (rooting, roms, i don't know what i'm talking about) is an advantage. Finally, spending $200/tablet and the possibility of a bulk order discount really makes this idea possible. I have the Galaxy Nexus phone and I love it, but I've never tried the tablet and they're not available yet in Central Asia. I'd be ordering from abroad. By mid autumn I could be buying 10+, so any advice would be great!

* How are people charging the N7 and getting audio output?  Do they just have a USB connector on the bottom of the N7 that is tucked behind dashboard panels?
* How are people sending music to their car stereos?  Do they take the audio out from the N7 into a separate amp, which then in turn feeds their speakers?
* How control the volume level since the N7's volume buttons seem to be behind dash kit panels in most of the best installs I've seen?
* Similar question, how are people turning their N7 on and off while it's installed and behind these dash panels?
* I've seen some pictures of people having their N7 hooked up to the internet (Google Maps Navigation, etc).  Are people tethering their N7 to their phones or something?  So while you are driving around you have full internet on the N7?  Is this tethering happen via USB or via Bluetooth?  Can you tether the N7 to an iPhone?

For starters, are you happy generally with the device?  Is there something particular you enjoy over other devices that you have used, or looked at.  Is there something that detracts from your experience?   

I will primarily use it for Surfing, and reading.  Maybe watching some videos on youtube or that sort of thing. Does anyone use it for substantial productivity?   I don't have that current need but who knows what the future may hold.   I did purchase an office app for my android phone, so I could use that I am sure if necessary, along with the google office apps. 


Is now the time to buy one?  I have only kept a slight pulse on the Nexus market, is there an expected new release of this device upcoming?

1347423862.0	zr13y	Google's Nexus 7 tablets 'can't perform' if flash RAM crammed (less than 3GB free)	poopin	41	14	40	"ARTICLE URL: [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/11/nexus_7/](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/11/nexus_7/)

ARTICLE TEXT: Reports are filtering in that some Google Nexus 7 tablets slow to a crawl once the memory starts filling up, and require a hard reset to bring them back to the admirable speed expected of Google's flagship hardware.

Most of the reports, on various forums, relate to the 16GB model, and claim that once the remaining capacity is down to around 2GB performance starts to suffer badly. Benchmarking software shows memory responding incredibly slowly, but most users just report applications slowing down or hanging, and all agree that the only solution is a hard reset as clearing the storage isn't good enough.

It's always difficult to judge how widespread a problem like this is: the numerous posting across message boards sometimes just indicates a vocal minority, but in this case the sources are particularly broad and the messages unusually conciliatory â€“ calling on Google and/or Asus (who manufactures the Nexus 7) to fix the problem, rather than just laying into the company.

It also seems safe to say that few Nexus 7 users will ever max out their devices' capacity. For most users a handful of albums and selection of films is all they'd want on a tablet, and that be slipped in with ease. Anyone with a decent collection of music has gotten used to leaving most of it at home since the classic iPod disappeared, and no one is trying to carry their DVD collection around with them yet, so most users won't be packing their Nexus 7 to the gunnels with content.

But if they do then they might hit this problem, as one user describes it: ""So here I am, stuck with a device that is labeled for 16GB storage, that in reality only has just over 13GB of storage ... but due to performance issues, REALLY only has 9-10 GB of storage available for content and software.""

Google hasn't responded to our queries on the matter. We'll let you know when/if it does, but in the meantime you might want to ensure your Nexus 7 has a little breathing space.

1345017307.0	y93dm	I figured out the exact size for perfect wallpapers	Almar-shor	36	8	6	"So there's apparently been some confusion over the proper size of wallpapers for the Nexus 7. As with all Android devices using the scrolling wallpaper format, the dimensions for a background image should have twice the width of the device's resolution. So in theory your wallpapers should be 1600x1280. And that's pretty close.

But you'll notice with those dimensions you still get a little bit of crop when setting wallpapers. This is because this is not accounting for the bars at the top and bottom of the screen; the notification bar and on-screen buttons. 

I spent the last couple of hours figuring out, through trial and error, the correct dimensions to use to fit wallpapers exactly how you want them.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

You will want to make your wallpaper image to fit between two bars, one at the top and one at the bottom. The bar at the top should be 71 pixels in height, and the bar at the bottom should be 37 pixels. The image in between the two bars is all that will show when in use. This image will be 1,172 pixels in height, if you've been counting. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/qlnzX.jpg) is an example image that I made shortly after figuring this out. I made the bars yellow so you could see, after setting the image as your wallpaper, that none of the top and bottom bars are showing through.

Note that when setting wallpapers with these dimensions, in the crop tool it'll seem like the yellow is going to show through, but it won't. Note that in my experiment I tried others (using plain colors for ease of view) with bars one pixel taller, and those showed through. 71 in the top and 37 in the bottom are exactly what fits.

1344619833.0	y086w	My experience with Google. (On my 3rd Nexus 7)	WolfyCat	51	22	36	"So, pretty much just ranting at this point and sharing my story for those who are interested.

From the UK, ordered my N7 on 14th July, received it on the 25th. Straight away I noticed I had problems with the left side of the glass not being flush with the bezel (you know the thing).

Called Google up that very same day. The rep (from Utah, America) emailed me a link to order a free replacement one from them. They also told me I'd receive a shipping label to ship it back to Asus.

My 2nd Nexus arrived 2nd of August. Didn't include a shipping label. How do I send it back to them!? What's worse is that the replacement ALSO had the same issue (not as bad, but I'm a perfectionist). Has an audible creak. Rang Google again the very same day, they told me that they would send off TWO shipping labels AND yet another Nexus 7. Was supposed to receive the labels within 48 hours. Nothing after a week. (It's destination is Holland if anybody is wondering*).

So I rang them again yesterday (9th August). After asking to speak to a manager I was sent another link to get another Nexus  (still my 3rd because they hadn't sent me one yet) and hallelujah today I received my first shipping label. TODAY. 16 days after my first Nexus 7 arrived.

Hopefully I wont have any problems with the 3rd and will have a shipping label for the 2nd.

Now I hear you ask Redditors, ""Why WolfyCat? Why the fuck are you still ordering more Nexuses and dealing with Google?""

I'll tell you why. Because it's a fucking great tablet, thats why. Better than my friend's iPad (who admits he wishes he had one). So smooth and fast, battery life is great and it fits my needs perfectly, (music, web browsing, email, YouTube, Skype, of course Reddit, Twitter and a light spot of gaming now and then). Oh and SO much customisation! I have a decent new-ish Android phone and I know what Android is capable of but have never done much because of the strain on the battery and speed. I have much more freedom with my Nexus 7.

If the 3rd one still isn't right, I'll happily go through the process again. I get to use a device while the other one arrives and its not costing me anything.

So yeah. Im happy with the tablet as a device but wish Google would get their shit together with customer service. Pretty appalling really.

[EDIT]: Ok so after letting my mum play around with the 2nd N7, she was reading a Steven King book sample and I've realised that it has some severe ghosting issues. About 5 minutes have passed and the lines are still visible. Can even make out individual letters here and there."	t5_2ucrx	True
1344556160.0	xyus3	After raving about how good the iPad 2 was, I just got a Nexus 7	nlakes	42	15	35	"This thing is awesome. For the price it really gives the iPad a run for its money. The screen is bright and crisp, the build quality is sturdy, the interface is fresh and snappy and the battery life is surprisingly good. Yeh, not quite iPad good but it's a AU$300 tablet vs. the AU$550 I pad for my iPad 2. I know most people here are already converted, but if you're sitting on the fence, *buy it*. I've long been one of those people who have shrugged off Android products saying ""*the physical build quality feels cheap. Just look at the Nexus S vs. the iPhone, plastic-fantastic*"". Not so with the Nexus 7. Bang for buck, this is probably the best tablet out there at the moment. 

I read a lot of PDF documents and I really like how Android has a file structure where you can just dump PDF files in a folder and then browse for them later. Using iTunes to load PDFs into iBooks really was a waste of my time, especially when I hadn't synced it in a while and I had to wait for 2gb of data to sync before it would load my pdfs. I still haven't found an app though that has a bookmark feature for PDFs on the Nexus 7, Adobe's app is good but lacks this feature, but I keep searching. 

Anyway, 7"" really is the perfect size to be big enough for content but small enough to take places. I really love this tablet, my iPad 2 has found its way into my gfs hands as I have found something better. 

TL;DR Best tablet in terms of features v price.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kovit.p.forevergone&amp;hl=en

When you run it, it shows how much free space you have, and it shows how much space it has overwritten and filled with junk.

What's interesting is that when it's filling the space, the numbers don't count smoothly. Instead, they count very rapidly for a period, and then stall, during which time my whole Nexus 7 is unresponsive just like when it lags, and then after a few seconds the numbers resume counting up very quickly.

The timing and duration of the stalls are both very variable, I don't see any pattern to them at all, so it's not like every 128 MB it has to flush the cache to NAND or anything like that.

So, /r/nexus7, what have you been using your Nexus 7 for?"	t5_2ucrx	True
1342665258.0	wsodf	Upgrading my factory stereo	shorty6049	34	7	38	"When the nexus 7 was announced, I had zero interest in one. ""7 inch tablets are dumb"" I said, ""I'll take my xoom over one of those little things any day!""

The following evening I was discussing android with a friend and mentioned how much better the GPS and media features on my phone are than most 500 dollar factory stereo replacements sold on Crutchfield  and elsewhere, and how great it would be if there were some sort of aftermarket nav screen that could plug into an android phone and mirror the display and touch control. 

Then I remembered the nexus 7 and ordered one about 10 minutes later.


(I wrote this second part before the first , so it's going to sound a bit weird in the first few sentences, just bear with me) 

So some of you may or may not have read one of my posts in the last couple weeks on here and /r/android but the reason I bought a nexus 7 was (primarily at least) to use it as a replacement, or maybe addition is a better word, to my [factory stereo/nav system](http://i.imgur.com/rBiBF.jpg) in my [08 Civic.](http://i.imgur.com/fW4LC.jpg) 

The tablet would be placed in front of the existing nav system, likely placed inside a case or possibly a homemade retainer which would attach with velcro for easy removal (no way I'm putting strips of velcro on the tablet body itself, it's too pretty) 

I'll be using an NFC  tag placed in my car to activate wifi tethering on my phone. The tablet will then receive the wifi signal and use that to stream music, check email, browse the web, or navigate (some of these will obviously be avoided while driving) . 

The tablet will stream music via bluetooth to a [bluebridge dongle](http://www.amazon.com/Miccus-BluBridge-Mini-Jack-Bluetooth-Bluetooth-Enabled/dp/B0038MA11U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342665186&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bluebridge+bluetooth+receiver) inserted into the AUX jack in the car

From what I can tell, the last update for the maps software was from 2006, and overall it's just kind of outdated interface and hardware.
An updated maps DVD is around 90 dollars from Honda and a decent replacement nav system is anywhere from 300 to 1000 dollars and they still lack the ability to do android stuff. 


So anyway! To the heart of this post now! 

I got the nexus yesterday and have been playing with it pretty much constantly since then. I got in my car this morning with it for the first time... the moment of truth... would it fit in front of my factory nav the way I hoped it would? (I never bothered to take any measurements of the space or look up size specs on the tablet beforehand ) 

[Here's the result](http://i.imgur.com/OolHA.jpg) 

Next step is to find a suitable case , or design a fancy holder piece from acrylic. Not sure what i'd rather do at this point...

So, I got my Nexus 7 a few months ago and don't really do much with it. Most of my time on it, I'm browsing Reddit. I have some free games on it (i.e. Temple Run, Hill Climb Racing, etc.) but don't really use it for anything else.

The actual lock button itself will also seem movable as if it were a widget but it is not. The Google now icon, before located next to the lock icon, is now at the bottom where the home button would be and uses a symbol then you would not know means Google now. That is awkward.

I read through most all of the comments and it wasn't angry vitriol, but rather a lot of irritated people voicing their (legitimate) complaints about how the whole situation has been handled. (Some comments were angry vitriol, but they were few and far between compared to the rest.) Many, many of the comments were being +1'ed by other people.

Vic definitely has the executive chops to give an official reply to the complaints. Instead of doing so, he just deleted the whole thing.

Color me unimpressed.

Help please?	daanishh	31	7	12	"I bought a Nexus 7 about 2 months ago, and it was perfectly fine except for the Screen Lift I noticed. It was pretty bad and obvious after I first noticed it, and not a ""minor"" lift like some people's devices, but it didn't hinder the use so I didn't care.

Up until like a week ago, when my screen would stop responding to my touches and I started noticing ghost or phantom touches. The screen would ""touch itself"" (ha ha) at random places, and either open new apps or back out of the current window rapidly.

This went on for a while, and would stop for a bit before starting up again. But now, it won't register my touches at all until I press down on the part of the screen where the screen lift is! (In the middle of the screen on the far right side.)

It's absolutely horrible and has rendered my N7 pretty useless. I tried opening the back and using the Q-Tip method to prevent screen lift, in hopes that this might be the solution. But apparently, on my device, the ribbon is even thicker than the size seen in the guide to using a qtip [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus7/comments/12qhke/how_i_permanently_fixed_my_screen_lifting/)

I could use any help I can get at this point! Also, I can't return it or anything because I was traveling and actually bought it in Saudi Arabia. 

Thanks guys.

They filed a case after walking me through hard resetting the device to make sure it wasn't a software issue. Shortly after that I sent my device to a ASUS service center and they sent it back after fixing it.

Xodium	36	12	34	"I upgraded my Nexus 7 to 4.2 by way of the stock factory images that Google provided. All said, everything worked just fine. Some of the features began to annoy me, however, and I really longed to have the Tablet UI back. No problem, I figured, I'll just reboot into Clockwork recovery, and restore my backup of CM10.

Except there was a problem. As part of the 4.2 upgrade, everything on /sdcard/ was moved to /sdcard/0 to accommodate the multi-user feature. (This also breaks a lot of apps that are hardcoded to look in /sdcard/ for stuff, apparently.) So CWM didn't know where the backup files were.

I thought I could just go into /sdcard/0 and move the clockworkmod folder back into /sdcard/, but alas, nothing would let me. On my PC, trying to touch *anything* in /sdcard/0 was met with Windows Explorer promptly crashing. Trying it on my MacBook Pro with Android File Transfer caused AFT to say the file could not be transferred. Trying to do it with root explorer/ES File Manager just caused nothing to happen.

I figured trying to flash CM10 might make the directory readable to apps, but sadly, it remained unaccessible under 4.1.2. Nothing would have a go on it. So I just ended up have to completely wipe the partition, nuking *everything* on my Nexus 7 in the process. I was unable to save any of my data.

So, if you're going to update and you care about nandroid backups, or any of your data, TAKE AN OFF-DEVICE BACKUP. Move those backup files OFF of the Nexus 7 and onto your own computer.

I just want to point out Asus's dead pixel warranty policy that can only be found in the warranty booklet in the box (I didn't see the policy on either Google's or Asus's site).

&gt; TFT LCD defect Policy

&gt;Despite the highest possible standard, the intricate manufacturing of thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) screens may still produce slight visual imperfections. These visual imperfections do not impair the performance of Your Product. 

&gt;However, ASUS will provide the Warranty service for Your ASUS Product's TFT LCD screen only if there are at least: 

&gt;* 3 bright dots or 5 dark hots or 8 bright and/or dark dots total; or
&gt;* 2 adjacent bright dots or 2 adjacent black dots; or
&gt;* 3 bright and/or dark dots within an area 15mm in diameter

If your dead pixels don't mesh with the above and you send it in for replacement, per Google: 

&gt;Additional charges up to the full price of your device will be incurred if our service center determines that the damage to your original device isnâ€™t covered under warranty.

So for anyone with a dead pixel problem that doesn't think it meets the criteria above, a return for refund and re-buying another is probably a safer bet."	t5_2ucrx	True

The ""sleeve hold"" ones go on the bezel.  Do they make it harder to do touch gestures around the bezel?

The sleeve holds seem very secure, but the clamp holds do not.  I'm not really sure how you insert the tablet into the clamp hold ones.  The sleeve hold ones also seem to offer more drop protection - the sleeve extends past the tablet a bit and is softer, so if it falls on a corner, the material deadens the blow?  That could just be my imagination.

So I had 4.1 on my Nexus 7 (after beating a hasty retreat to it from 4.2.1), and I've been pretty comfy with it.

I've been hearing mixed things about 4.2.2, but I'm unsure if it has fixed any of the problems 4.2.1 had, like lag issues and Bluetooth issues. What's this subreddit's opinion on 4.2.2?

http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/mobile/prfUDZA7M2s[1-25-false]

This will be a long winded post, but please read on, and test your own Nexus 7 if you have one.. I'm trying to see if this is a common issue.

When running a GPS app for more than ~10 minutes sometimes it will just stop working, stuck Searching for satellites endlessly, until a complete reboot of the device. It's not just time that can cause the issue either; The device falling asleep while a GPS app is running sometimes causes it, or running more than 1 app that uses GPS. Sometimes GPS will work fine, until you REALLY need it, like a few miles out of town. And other times, it fails for seemingly no reason other than having moved location a bit. And sometimes intentionally doing those things wont cause it, oddly enough.

It happens whether or not WiFi is enabled, or whether or not Google's ""Wi-Fi &amp; mobile network location"" option is on or off. Happens regardless, even after factory resets and cache clears. Sometimes GPS can even work perfectly for most the day, sitting on my desk with a GPS Status App on. But the moment I try to use the tablet for *actual* GPS navigation it will fail again.

Once the issue occurs, so far the only fix is to shutdown the tablet and restart it. And that will only help for a few more minutes.

**This is an issue some average users (who don't use GPS to actually navigate) might not even notice..**  If you have one of the new 2013 Nexus 7s, try testing a few things: Go on a walk or drive with a GPS or Map App running, and see if the location is showing you at the correct spot, and see how long that lasts. This seems to be the easiest way to trigger the problem. Eventually your location will just freeze at the last spot the GPS was working at. Or your Satellite status will freeze, and GPS will get stuck in a Searching mode.

**NOTE:** GPS might seem like it's working perfectly fine, at your home, while inside a WiFi network. But that may be because it's using your WiFi to determine your location. To better test this issue, I think you can go into the Location Access settings, and disable Google's ""Wi-Fi &amp; mobile network location"" option. This should force the tablet to use real GPS for it's location, not wifi.

Google hasn't yet acknowledged this issue, as far as I can tell, and so I have no idea if it's a software or hardware issue.  But it does seem to be a sort of software glitch. You'd think a hardware glitch would be more consistent, whereas this is extremely random in occurrence.
I'm really hoping it is software, because that can be patched/fixed, and I wont have to return my device..

I hope this can be figured out soon, so I CAN get a replacement before my return time runs out, if need be. :/"	t5_2ucrx	True

Kernels: A huge factor in this is what kernel you have.  There's all sorts of different kernels out there that all do different things, here are the best kernels I've encountered.

1. Trinity Seven, I have gotten the BEST battery life and performance balance out of this kernel, the homescreen is extremely buttery and it scores high in benchmarks (there are some sleep issues where the device takes a few seconds to wake up) [Trinity Seven site.](http://www.derkernel.com/jb-seven.php)

2. Faux123, although the battery life is not as amazing as Trinity, this kernel takes the cake in performance.  I have found faux123 to be the fastest kernel I've ever used, it instantly wakes up, and you can overclock up to 1.7 Ghz (temps stay below 60c most of the time).

**Every device is different, some kernels may work better on some devices than others.  There's a lot of trial and error involved**


ROMs: Another big factor is your ROM.  Some ROMs handle memory better making them smoother, some have better UI's, some have so many features it makes them laggy etc.  Here's a list of the best ROMs I've used.

1. Cyanogenmod 10.1, it's all you'll ever need.  It's smooth as fuck, lean, and it keeps the great simplistic look of stock android 4.0+.
[Cyanogenmod N7 page.](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Grouper_Info)  

2. Paranoid Android, if you're looking to get even more customization than you already have on android, go PA.  Paranoid has great customization features like Tablet UI, and app colors.  Performance in PA is not as good as Cyanogenmod though.
[Paranoid Android XDA thread.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1800268)

Tuning: Although installing a custom ROM/kernel will definitely increase performance, you can push EVEN MORE power out of an N7 with tuning.  For example, I used to get 4.5k to 5k in quadrant (I know it's not good to use it as a benchmark I use it to see the difference in tweaks) but by going into TricksterMOD [\(which you can download by clicking this\)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigeyes0x0.trickstermod&amp;hl=en) and changing the governor settings I started getting 7.5k to 8k (18,000 on cpu) of course the temps went up a little but but that much.

Every device is different, so you should try everything and see what works best for you.

1357329888.0	15ytf8	My Treegloo horror story; read if you're looking for a case!	lyonhart31	34	10	31	"I purchased my Nexus 7 on Aug 19, 2012, and I immediately fell in love. Soon, I was looking for a case so I wouldn't damage my little bundle of Android joy. I had read an article on Cult of Android that was reviewing Treegloo cases. They had a lot of nice things to say about the quality of the product for the price. I browsed the site a bit and decided this was a good idea. Oh how wrong I was.

I placed my order for my custom designed case on Oct 29, 2012, and waited. The confirmation email said it would take 7-21 business days before my case would ship. Whatever, its a handmade case. I can wait a month or so. So wait I did. The case almost slipped from my memory. But one day I dropped my Nexus and dinged the corner. Nothing major, still works, etc. But I remembered...shouldn't my case be on its way by now? I hadn't received any correspondence; no tracking number, no apologetic message, nothing. So, on Dec 13, I wrote to Treegloo, wondering why I hadn't heard anything in over 2 months.

They did not reply to that email. Eventually, the new year passed and it dawned on me: $60 has been off of my credit card since August, over 2 months now, and I don't even have an email from Treegloo to show for it. I got angry. I sat down and sent another email to the production team, once again detailing my frustration and disappointment, and my expectation that the case would be entirely satisfactory. I posted on their Facebook page (no response there). I called them at the number that was listed in the confirmation email (none listed on the site, however. Only email addresses). And finally, I filed a complaint with the BBB, learning along the way that Treegloo is unaccredited and has a rating of F. This was all on Jan 2, 2013.

On Jan 3, I resent my email. I planned to do so every day until they responded. Thankfully, someone finally perked up an ear and wrote back. It was Johnathan R., the production manager for Treegloo Products. He expressed that he was very sorry they couldn't respond to yesterday's email sooner (how about the email I sent in December, you twit?) and said that while ""We understand that you would like your case...by filing a dispute with BBB, further communication must be handled through their mediation."" He also informed me that mediation can take up to 10 days, which on Treegloo time could probably mean over a month. He then presented me with two options:

1) Cancellation and refund

2) Await BBB mediation

That was it. No apology for the amazingly long wait for my case, no explanation for why I hadn't heard anything until then, just a passive aggressive email that made it sound like I was the bad guy for involving the BBB.

Part of me really wants to deny these people my money and shop elsewhere for a case. However, I've gone through so much, I really want something to show for it, and I would like to see Treegloo change the wording in their policies and such to express the time that it could actually take to get a case from them. I've seen many other stories on Reddit, BBB, and elsewhere on the Internet of people waiting ages for their case and having an utter lack of communication from the Treegloo. I want to see a result.

So I'm asking you, Redditors of /r/Nexus7. Should I deny these idiots their money and buy a different case? Or should I hope that with the BBB involved I can actually gain some traction?

**TL;DR: Bought a $60 custom Nexus 7 case from Treegloo, hasn't arrived or even shipped in over 2 months, they never responded to any emails, calls, posts, etc. until Jan 3. BBB is involved. Refund, or mediation?**

 I read that I will have to wipe the date by doing a hard resest [holding down the UP and DOWN volume keys and the POWER button while the pad is off] but even this isn't working when I initiate the hard reset the N7 freezes on the Google logo screen.

  Now I think im forced to return the device and get a new one.

(Because my debugging mode isn't ON, I can't do any of the PC connection tricks I searched on teh internet)

[Sample Image of my problem](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uImdsgjXgmU/Tj-bDfNcjdI/AAAAAAAADek/kUOrumg0Niw/s1600/too+many+pattern+attempts.png) except mine doesn't have Wifi ON.



EDIT: FineWolf's Fix

So I downloaded Android SDK from [HERE](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

I then downloaded the Android USB Drivers from [HERE](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html#Win7) and followed the instructions to update the drivers for my N7

Once updated I turned off my N7 and bootloaded it by holding POWER BUTTON and VOLUME DOWN BUTTON.
I then connected the N7 to my PC while in the bootloader screen.

I then went to My Computer &gt;  My Harddrive &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt; Android &gt; android-sdk
On ""platform-tools"" you hold down SHIFT AND RIGHT-CLICK &gt;  click on -Open command window here-
type in 

*fastboot oem unlock*

and you'll be able to go to RECOVERY MODE and reset your N7

LESSON LEARNED
Don't TURN OFF your WIFI just go into AIRPLANE MODE because then you can still access WIFI if you reach the ""too many pattern attempts"" screen of death without WIFI.

EDIT 2

If you can no longer access your N7 on your computer I tried this and it worked

You may try to use device manager to solve the issue.:
Firstly please connect your Nexus 7 to you computer using the USB cable 
included in the box.
Then on the tablet, 
choose ""Settings"" -&gt; ""Storage"" -&gt; open the menu -&gt; choose ""USB computer connection"" -&gt; choose ""MTP"" or ""PTP

how I use my stock 7."	sideofpicklez	35	15	9	"I mostly use my N7 for reddit, chatting and the occasional phone call, but also for media consumption of all sorts.

I use an bunch of reddit apps.

* [Reddit in Pictures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antew.redditinpictures) is great for casual browsing while feeding the baby,laying down to sleep, or poopin. Swiping from image to image as naturally as if I was going through my own photo albums. It's no good for reading comments however, so I linked the browser at the top to the next app.
* [Reddit News Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news) has a slick interface, and I like the swipe up/down to go back and forth between post and comments
* [Reddit is Fun](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit) is what my use for more traditional Redditing, and it seems to be the easiest to switch subreddits.

*[aTorrent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilityflow.torrent) is used for downloading the daily show, or comic books, nintendo romz or whatever media strikes my fancy

*[Solid Explorer Beta 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer) is useful for shipping files off to Dropbox,Google Drive, Box, and SkyDrive. My N7 is only 8gig so I supplement my storage quite a bit with these services

*[Perfect Viewer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rookiestudio.perfectviewer) is an awesome comic book reader, and you can link the amazon style bookshelf directly to your dropbox folder, just ""mark as favorite"" the books you plan on reading that day and they just show up

*[Kindle For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle) is fricken sweet once you use the email to kindle way of loading books onto it. You will have cloud access to any book sent this way on any device you buy until amazon goes out of buisness. This service works for DRM'd amazon books, or books otherwise obtained. I recomend doing all the email shenanigans from a computer.

*[BeyondPod](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod.hd) is my prefered podcast manager, it works well and if you bought the phone app, the BeyondPodUnlockKey.apk still unlocks the tablet app.

[Nova Launcher Prime(paid)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime) This thing is friggin great. 2 Million features but I'll just share my favorites, enable a scrollable dock, I use 2 docks, both are mostly full of folders, but with the Nova dock you can set it so that darggin the folder up a little launches a program. I spent a couple evenings to get everything set up, but hiding all the apps in my app drawer that I don't need there, and having them all in folders I don't see unless I scroll my dock is wonderful.

[Super Video, Floating and Popup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gpc.myweb.hinet.net.PopupVideo) Is my favorite video player, its easy to use and it will stay playing and on top of all other activity while I reddit.

1363612556.0	1ait6y	Docked N7 won't charge with OTG; anyone have any luck with Timur's USB ROM docked? Any other solutions?	aspartame_junky	27	8	9	"A [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus7/comments/1aextq/usb_otg_and_dock_questions/) discussed using a USB OTG and the official dock:

Apparently, if you are using an OTG cable, the N7 goes into host mode, and even if you have the official dock, the N7 will not charge through the pogo connector.  

From my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong), it seems that plugging in an OTG cable shifts android into OTG host mode, and so it will provide power to the attached device, while at the same time disallowing charging.  Consequently, even though the nexus says that it is charging, it is actually not, and the battery is drained as if it's running on battery-only, even while docked.   

I have confirmed this on numerous occasions (e.g., using Nexus Media Importer reading a PDF for a few hours, battery drains significantly while docked).  Major bummer.  This appears to be a major design oversight, although I wouldn't be surprised if Google does nothing about this and suggests people shouldn't be using OTG cables anyway.

It was [suggested recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus7/comments/1aextq/usb_otg_and_dock_questions/c8wsynr) that Timur's USB ROM has some power management features that may be useful for such a situation, but most of the rootzwiki posts are about using OTG Y-cables or in-dash car setups.

Has anybody had any luck using Timur's ROM to allow the N7 to charge on the dock while simultaneously using OTG?

Alternatively, does anyone have any other possible solutions to this problem? (as it seems to reduce the usefulness of the dock substantially).

*****

**EDIT**: I've submitted feedback to both Google and ASUS regarding this design oversight.  Methinks that the only way this will be corrected in stock android is if enough people complain.

[ASUS Feedback link](https://vip.asus.com/VIP2/Services/complain?lang=en-us)

Google's is a bit tougher to provide, since they make it almost impossible to actually contact anyone regarding device support.   However, I was able to receive an email reply with [this contact form](http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/request.py?contact_type=devices_payments).

**EDIT 2**: [Here is a link](http://mehrvarz.github.com/nexus-7-usbrom/) for the Nexus 7 USB ROM, based on CM10.1 and including Timur's kernel extensions.

One thing that I find really frustrating is setting a background (wallpaper). I find a picure that I like, set it up with the tool, and I get the picture I want. Until I turn it around to landscape mode, and then it looks like shit. Even when you setup the picture and you think you might have a semi-decent landscape pic, it looks worse than what the preview shows.

It would be nice if we had the option of creating seperate portrait and landscape pictures to have a better representation of expressing ourselves, or to even have two different pictures.

Am I missing something here? Anybody know of a way to set this up better or is there a tool that will do it for me?"	t5_2ucrx	True

1351836770.0	12i4jc	Totally replace Smart Phone With Nexus 7	Thegomesteam	23	2	50	" ***** 11/2/2012******2 AM****

Hi there! Right now I have a Galaxy Note 2 and I love it. I love it so much because it's a step closer to a tablet than most phones. I was thinking why don't I just get a tablet, but I don't want to carry around a tablet and a Smart Phone. 

I'm thinking of totally getting rid of my smart phone and just use a Skype Mobile number plus Google voice to send sms. I would need a data plan, but it seems like that will be enough to replace my smart phone. I would have a bigger screen, more power, and it's cheaper monthly! Have any of you considered this?

Alternative: Just get a dumb phone and a tablet. The problem with that is carrying around two things when one should suffice?

Possible Annoyances: I may need to give out two numbers... one for calling and one for texting. I don't actually talk to people on the phone that often but it's really not an inconvenience to me :P. Google Voice has a 125 ish text limit. I doubt I'll reach that limit often. I'll probably just write an app to keep a sms counter for a 24 hour time range.

I'm a little iffy on the Google Voice sms bit. Alternatives would be appreciated.

Give me your opinions and your criticisms! I really want to do this, but I want to make sure I know all obstacles that I could encounter. Thanks!


********** UPDATE ***** 11/2/2012****** 7 PM****

Today I did a test run.

1. I set up a Google Voice(GV) account.
2. I used my current sprint number (evo: old phone number) as my forwarding number.
3. I set up GVMax I was able to send/receive messages from my GV number.
4. I used GroovIP App and I was able to call my (evo: old phone number) from my test device (note 2: new phone number) and it appeared as my GV number.

To give it a true run through I'll need to:

* Use a Skype number as my forwarding number
* Put GroovIP App on my nexus 7 (which I have yet to buy)
* And I'll need to port my (evo: old phone number), the one I want to keep, into Google Voice

The trial run was a good sign. I'll be doing additional tests today with some friends.

********** UPDATE ***** 11/2/2012****** 8 PM****

My friends are getting a busy signal when trying to call me. This is apparently due to Hurricane Sandy. Not a big concern to me since I rarely talk on the phone and this stuff happens around New Years Eve and natural disasters on normal mobile carriers. SMS worked just fine though."	t5_2ucrx	True

1351037026.0	11z6ci	iOS user, considering Nexus 7 over iPad Mini. Have a few questions.	LiarInGlass	30	8	59	"I'm in the market for a simple tablet for web browsing, Facebook, Twitter, and mostly Comic book reading (The Walking Dead), and ebook reading.

I was thinking of just getting the iPad Mini because I'm in the iOS ecosystem with my iPhone and I've used iOS since the first iPhone, but I don't really think I feel like paying $329 for the iPad Mini. I don't want this post to start some flaming war, so please don't start that. 

My few questions that I'm trying to find answers for is how well is the Facebook/Twitter/web browsing experience on the Nexus 7? I'm also confused on how the ebooks work. Can I just copy and paste my .mobi or .epub files to the correct directory via USB and they will show up in the book reader application? I've used Android before, but it wasn't for a long period of time, so I don't know much about how the system actually operates. I'm assuming it's more file based than having to be synced like on an iOS device.

Another question is how well is emulation, specifically for Genesis/NES/SNES emulation? I really miss having a portable device to play older games on, and I was thinking the Nexus 7 is cheaper and would be awesome to play my emulated games on, if they work properly? If so, what is the best application I should consider getting for each of those systems?

Lastly, is reading books via the Nexus 7 a good experience? I love the iBooks application on my iPhone, and I love the application and how it works, and am wondering if reading books on the Nexus is a good experience as well? Thanks."	t5_2ucrx	True

I purchased the Magnus Stylus from ApplyDea in May of 2013. Love its feel and overall quality. However, I've run into a 
very strange problem. My Nexus 7 started to get flaky, the touch screen got slow, then jittery. Every app, every day. It
got to the point that I couldn't use it at all.

Keep in mind I was using the Magnus exclusively.

I contacted Google thinking it was my tablet going bad (I've had it since April 2013), and they had me do some clean up and 
reset. Great! Everything was back to normal. For 1 day. Then it started again. Slightly different behavior, but still unusable.
This time it degraded much faster.

By chance I started using my finger instead of the Magnus and guess what? Everything was normal again. I changed back to my 
previous stylus and I've had no problems since. On a lark I decided to try the Magnus again and yes, it messed up the tablet. 
Stranger than the problem itself is that I used this Stylus for 4 weeks with no issue, now I can't use it at all before I see problems.

I have no idea why, I can only imagine it might be the magnet (or possibly the tip, its much firmer rubber than any other Stylus I own) 
but I don't know. 

Anyone else see anything like this? Its not that big a deal except the ApplyDea stylus is wicked expensive."	t5_2ucrx	True

I like to protect my tech, so I was looking for a good screen protector.

While browsing Amazon, I found the [Seidio ACTIVE](http://www.amazon.com/Seidio-ACTIVE-Multi-Purpose-Google-BD2-CSK3ASN7-BK/dp/B009T0FIWM/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358741710) case, which isn't as slim but offers full protection for the tablet.

Right now, I'm leaning towards the Poetic, just for the cheaper price.

I understand that the increased protection will add a bit of weight and bulk to the tablet. I've done something similar with my iPod nano 3G, so I figure it shouldn't be too bad.

Am I just being paranoid? Should I just buy the Moko and a screen protector?

Thanks for your input. :)

I've been having the same issue as many other people since updating to 4.2. General lagginess, random reboots etc. Disabling currents didn't help. I decided to try turning off location access and voila, it worked! My Nexus 7 is now just as responsive and reliable as it was the day I got it with JB 4.1. Unfortunately some Google Now features rely on Location access (and thus don't work), as does maps (depending on what you are doing, I guess) and a slew of other apps.

For example, any such permissions-app could provide false information to the requesting apps (e.g., a contacts list with 0 entries, even if you have many entries), in addition to logging any such requests so that users can verify which apps are requesting what information.

While I like the case, it's slightly too bulky for my liking.  When I take the Nexus out of the case and use it, it just feels perfect in my hands.  

This is the way I prefer to use my phone, caseless.  Its protected by the cozy depths of my pants pocket as I wander around with it.  But of course the Nexus 7 doesn't fit into my pants, so I have to use a case.

This seems to be the slimmest looking case I've found:

It's only a bit slimmer, but I think it might be enough to warrant the price.

Are there any other cases that people have found that are as thin or thinner?  I would like there to be an option to use it as a stand like the Poetic one does.

Thanks!

**Update:**

So I ordered the Poetic Slimline: http://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Slimline-Portfolio-Automatically-Manufacturer/dp/B008NMCPTQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357651932&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=poetic+slimline  and was instantly put off by it.  The hard plastic feel of it was not nearly as nice to hold as the leathery one I was used to.  And the edges of it seemed almost sharp, making it even less comfortable to hold.  The weight of it was nice, but with the negatives I had to return it.

I've decided to stick with the case that I already have:

I will mainly be using it to read books and watch the odd movie. I've not found a demo Nexus with a decent video on it to watch, so does anyone know how the Nexus screen and audio compares to that of the Fire HD, I was quite surprised how good the sound was on the Fire, not tinny like other tablets I've used.

Think the Nexus is sleeker and looks better, and a full version of android would be nicer than sideloading stuff, but I think I'm more bothered about video and audio quality, so any help would be much appreciated.  

Okay, so as far as i can see

Kindle Fire 

**Major benefits**

* HDMI out 
* Better audio 

**Minor benefits**

* Better wifi 
* Less screen glare (or so amazon claim) 
* (better kindle app? unless the general one has been updated too to the same one, certainly had features i don't have on my phone one, not overly bothered either way)

Nexus 7 

**Major benefits**  

* Full android OS 
* More likely to get android updates and sooner 

**Minor benefits**

* Sleeker design and general look 
* Better processor 

i was just beginning to side with nexus, but hdmi out could be very useful

I got my Nexus 7 in earlier this week along with that newfangled AM Stylus with the fiber/rubber hybrid tip (&gt;$10, http://www.amazon.com/hybrid-stylus-iphone-kindle-Packing/dp/B008MOHLVC/). I absolutely hated the old full rubber styluses, but this thing is smooth as silk, even across my anti-glare covers. I don't have to apply pressure at all. It'd be nice if the tip were narrower, but it works fine as is.

I take notes on a daily basis in classes, and after about half a day of getting used to writing in it, I feel like this is going to/has replaced paper notes for me.

I tried out a few other handwriting programs, but I don't think I saw anything else that had the ability to shrink down your handwriting to fit on a 'normal' sized line like Freenote does (as opposed to leaving your handwriting at actual size so you can really only fit a few words per line at most that all look like they were written in crayon).

And the main 3 I've tried are (my comments included):

* [Winamp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nullsoft.winamp&amp;feature=search_result), full version is 4.99 usd.

&gt;Pros:

&gt;* Stable. It has never crashed (on mine N7).

&gt;* Displays lyrics without the need of another app.

&gt;Cons:

&gt;* It's old I'm sick of winamp (maybe a bad reason for a con)

&gt;* The user interface could be better.

&gt;* Many widgets.

______________

* [Poweramp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxmpz.audioplayer&amp;feature=search_result), Full version cost 3.96 usd

&gt;Pros:

&gt;* Big album cover art.

&gt;* Very neat organized library.

&gt;* The user interface is well designed, you have everything you need at hand.

&gt;Cons:

&gt;* In my case, when I am surfing between apps or open/closing apps, the player seems to lag and I hear a noise, like a scratched CD.

&gt;* It need an app (installed separately) to be able to display lyrics, and I dislike said app. [musixmatch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.musixmatch.android.lyrify&amp;feature=search_result). Anyone knows how to fix that?

______________

* [N7Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.n7mobile.nplayer&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5uN21vYmlsZS5ucGxheWVyIl0.), Fill version is 3.14 usd.

&gt;Pros:

&gt;* Cool IU, odd but cool. specially in landscape mode.

&gt;Cons:

&gt;* Odd IU, sometimes it takes a minute to find what you want.

&gt;* The library, it takes time to the way its displayed.

&gt;* Requires the same musicXmatch app in to display lyrics.

My app works in a similar fashion to ReNotify and Notif, but adds a few extra features and has an emphasis on pure speed. Works smoothly on the Nexus 7. 

FEATURES: 

* Set notes through voice recognition

* Set location-based notes (i.e, set the location of your carpark, or the location of your next appointment)

* Set quick notifications

* Set notifications with titles and colors.

* Holo Theme

* Compatible with all devices 4.0+

I decided to forgo using ads for the application, and it clocks in at less than a quarter of a megabyte!

1357486941.0	162acp	Streaming the nexus 7 to a Roku	Effervesser	26	9	7	"I recently discovered the Roku app for my Nexus 7 and it is extremely useful. I can control my Roku, go through my channels and the store and really do things much more quickly than with just the remote. But I also found out that it allows me to play music and pictures from my Nexus. 

The music is useful, the pictures, not so much but it leaves me wondering, is there any way to stream something like youtube or videos saved on my Nexus onto my tv using my Roku? Are there any other ways to stream the Nexus 7 to a tv? If so why the heck does cable still exist?"	t5_2ucrx	True

That might work, but it no longer allows me to choose which side of the tablet my operating hand is on. It needs to be on the left if I want to access notifications. I was very much hoping for the two-finger swipe like what would be on a phone.

But that isn't what bothers me the most. It's the feeling of the drawer that throws me off. in 4.1, you can fling the tray down and it would reach a certain point and stop (about 3/4 of the screen length). Now, if you drag it down past where the notification list ends, it immediately jerks back upwards and stops at the bottom of the list. It's really offputting, even though it seems so insignificant. The old feeling of momentum that actually made the tray satisfying to open is gone. It's like it is trying to take up less screen space. I'm not going to be able to do other things with the tray open anyways, so why make it smaller?

It definitely slowed my discharge rate down, but didn't stop it. I normally use Waze, Doggcatcher, and any other various music apps, but no matter what I've used, the battery is still discharging.


*UPDATE*

So it would appear that the usb cable in fact is the culprit here. I know chargers themselves effect charge rate but this is new to me on the cable.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do next, because I bought a right angle cable since the nexus is mounted in landscape mode. I really want the right angle so the cable points downwards, as it looks cleaner and is also less stress on the cable itself, but I really don't want to play russian roulette on guessing a cable that will work correctly.

So- what does everybody else do?

I'll go in to network settings and try to manually reconnect to my network, but it will tell me that it can't connect.

&gt; Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDAhdCEGR1Y&amp;feature=youtu.be



When I got the N7 initially, I bought a relatively cheap, sort-of-made-for-Nexus-7 case, but in the long run, I wasn't satisfied with it: it lacked a magnet, it felt a bit loose and was made of pretty cheap material.



A week ago I ordered the SD TabletWear smartcase from MobileFun (mobilefun.de or mobilefun.co.uk) because it was on sale, looked good in the photos, and had very good buyer reviews. Today it arrived.



This case is skin-tight, and by tight I don't mean it squeezes the N7, but it's an absolutely TIGHT fit. When the lid is closed, it feels like one solid brick of kit. Feels awesome when carrying it and doesn't slip because the surface is textured in a weave-like material (see photos). The cover material is a little bit iridescent but it doesn't really reflect that much light or distract from using the N7.



The magnet works without any hiccups or flakiness. Open lid, N7 wakes up, close lid N7 goes to sleep; repeat. No complaints there. The case itself without the N7 (e.g. the lid when opened) is also very sturdy. You shouldn't apply force to it (you never should), but otherwise I see this surviving a lot of things to come. Also, there is no visible (or feel-able, for that matter) bump anywhere on the case for the magnet. It's simply hidden and simply works.



At the top, there is a cutout for both the N7's camera and the light sensor, whereas my old case did only have an opening for the camera (cheapo, like I said).



All ports and buttons are perfectly accessible, even the left-hand-side mic on the N7 has a small cutout hole (props for detail here).



The case also features as a stand. The angle when using the stand (see pic) is about 30 degrees. This comes in quite handy when e.g. placing it on the table next to your mousepad and other stuff, but is maybe not too ideal if you want to watch video and place the N7 vertically or almost vertically, because with this case, you can not really do that: there is a fold in the front cover so the 30 degree stand can be applied, but that same fold makes the cover, well, fold, if you try to use it as a perch against something to place the Nexus rightup.



The manufacturing is, like I said, stability-wise **very** solid, but it is probably hand-made and thus there are a *few* tiny imperfections in 2-3 places, which you probably normally wouldn't see unless you would make a review like I'm doing right now and inspect every single square millimeter.



The price point: ~20â‚¬ (without shipping), which makes this a pretty good value.



My final rating: 8/10, would buy again. Only 8 because of the small imperfections, and the missing ability to place the N7 vertically. If you need this feature, then despite being really awesome, this case is probably not for you.

Since it is pretty heavy in comparison to a tablet, I consider getting a Nexus7. 

I want to use the Nexus7 in class to take notes, read/annotate PDFs and entertainment. I'm sure I won't be able to type as fast on the touchscreen keyboard as I do on a hardware keyboard, I consider getting an external keyboard (e.g. from Logitech) right away. 

Since I always like my notes structured I wanted to know how well this device handles text formatting in Google Drive/Docs. Unfortunately none of my friends has an Android tablet so I cannot answer the following questions myself:

* Does the device support keyboard shortcuts for jumping to the next word or the beginning of the line? (E.g. Ctrl + Rightarrow)
* If I am taking notes using a bulleted list, will the tab-key (permanently) indent the list?
* Is it possible to manually assign keyboard shortcuts?

1344261135.0	xrjvu	Weird Nexus 7 problem	JamesSpartacus	18	3	23	"I was playing a game (Ski Safari) while my battery was at 20% and plugged into my laptop via usb and my tablet randomly shut off without warning - including a brief screen scrambling and static noise just prior to shutting down. Now, I've seen other people have this problem but mine is slightly different - now my device won't finish booting. It gets past the Google logo but then hangs on the glowing X. Tried getting it into recovery, but when I get to the screen with the Android guy with his belly panel open, I can't do anything (stuck on the start option, power button doesn't ""start"" and volume buttons don't change the option - i.e. to recovery) 

So yeah needless to say I'm going through the RMA process but haven't heard back from Google as I have just called yesterday.

TL;DR - Nexus 7 crashed, now gets stuck in bootloop and can't get into recovery

It's slowing down and filling up quickly. It's one of the few that has had problems with constant slowdown with no real fix - I've been through every placebo fix and snake oil method on this subreddit a few times each by now. I'm looking forward to the new-model Nexus 7 coming out in a few weeks, but I'm wondering if I ought to upgrade to the 10.

Now that we know more about the hardware (the new 7 comes with a ""Snapdragon S4 Pro"" processor) - I'm not sure how that stands up to the Exynos 1.7ghz quad core in the Nexus 10. Is the new Nexus 7 more powerful than the 10? About the same? It has the same amount of RAM, at least. 

I use my tablet primarily around the house, for watching Netflix in bed, doing a bit of e-reading and for (mostly emulator) gaming. I'm willing to spend the extra for the 10, but only if it's a marked improvement over the new 7.

1357318694.0	15yh7p	A few questions about what I'll lose after rooting and the recovery process.	ForeverUnclean	19	4	11	"Hey everyone, first off, let me say that after coming to this subreddit on Christmas after I got my N7, I've learned a lot about this device and Android in general.  It's my first Android device, so naturally I had a lot of questions, and I was able to find answers to most of them here.

I know there's a ton of info about rooting on here, but I'm still unclear about a few things.  I know I'll lose everything during the root process and my N7 will be restored to factory settings...that's fine.  I don't really have much on here yet except for some games/apps I've downloaded, and I haven't gone too crazy with changing any of the settings. 

I'm really just wondering how easy/thorough the recovery process is.  After I'm done rooting, will I be able to recover my old apps/settings all at once, or will I have to redownload everything individually?  Would I need to flash a new ROM before I recover everything, or will I still be able to get everything back after flashing a new ROM?  What's the easiest way to get everything back to the way it was before it was rooted?  

Finally, will I be able to recover game data from games I have to get rid of before rooting? More specifically, there's a game called Puzzle and Dragons that I've been playing a lot of.  Every so often, it tells you not to delete the game as you will also lose all of your data, even if you reinstall the game later on.  As far as I can tell, you're assigned a user number when you install the game, and all your data is tied to that. Is there a way to wipe my N7 before rooting it, but somehow keep the game data from that game intact so I would be able to pick up where I left off before rooting?

1344619078.0	y07do	Dodocase for Nexus7 mini-review	RidiculousHat	20	3	14	"So I picked up a Dodocase for my Nexus 7-- here are my thoughts after using it for a week. Pics are in this imgur album: http://imgur.com/a/AQjK5

**BUILD QUALITY**

* The case is made out of some kind of fake leather. I don't know what it is, but it feels awesome and expensive-- it's clearly designed to feel like a moleskine, and the feel is not far off. The elastic band is nice and is quite secure.
* The monogramming may be a little... indulgent, but it looks super classy and the black-on-black is subtle while still being noticeable.
* Not exactly sure what the liner inside is, but the website's claim that it makes the case feel like a book is not inaccurate... when the case is folded over and held with one hand, it does feel like a curiously light hardcover.
* The case does add a bit to the thickness and weight of the device, but doesn't make it any more difficult to hold with one hand. You'll forget about the difference after using it for a day or two.

**ADHESIVE**

Yes, this case uses adhesive to keep your tablet secure-- and yes, it is a little scary at first. Lining it up takes some time if you have a flair for perfectionism... mine is about a millimeter too far to the left. :(

However, the adhesive is quite strong, and in my (admittedly limited) time with the case it has never once shifted or given me any reason to believe that the tablet would come loose. Shortly after I first attached it, I made a half-hearted attempt to remove and recenter it... did not budge. The amount of force I would require to detach the case is substantial!

For this reason, I cannot recommend this case if you plan on removing your tablet from it on a regular or semi-regular basis. If you're looking for a permanent solution, this is a good one.

**DAILY USAGE NOTES**

* Smart cover screen on/off functionality works consistently and is pretty badass. 
* Buttons are still accessible along the edge of the tablet-- volume is easy to adjust and power button is easy to access, though I haven't needed it with the smart cover.
* Cover does not block any ports or microphones. Speaker audio sounds about the same to me, though I will admit to barely using the built-in speaker.
* You can perch the case with the elastic band (as pictured) and it's stable on a flat, hard surface... but unlike a folio case, if you're trying to prop it up on a softer/less flat surface you're going to have trouble.
* This case will get you a lot of compliments. 

**UPDATE: PURCHASE LINK**

Has anyone already purchased a case? If so, which case, and what do you think about it?

I'm debating whether or not to buy one with an auto sleep/wake feature. I'd like to hear feedback about those, if anyone has one.

Cheers!

1376590587.0	1kfm4g	Minisuit Keyboard Case Stand review	HeroJC	18	3	7	"Hi r/Nexus7, I wrote a review of one of my cases i bought on amazon and I thought I'd share it here as well:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E8IWU1W

""Just received my Nexus 7 FHD version yesterday. For a product that cost me $18 in total (shipping to Canada), I wasn't expecting too much. All the other reviews seemed to be up and down so I was cautiously optimistic. The product shipped out late since I pre-ordered and they gave me a free complimentary stylus to compensate. The product arrived on time even though it started shipping late. Usually I wouldn't comment much on a stylus, but it came with a nice leather case. Who puts styluses in leather cases? (I believe it's real leather since this material is actually nicer than the material of the case itself lol).
As for the case, in terms of quality it is what you'd expect for the most part. Fits well and it's very protective. THe faux leather is soft and feels really good in hand. Perhaps it's just me but I'd actually be concerned about it tearing. Hopefully the velcro that holds it in will last. Not that there's issue with the velcro, it's just that the way it's positioned the device's weight will put strain on that side.
The keyboard is actually MUCH better than I expected (FYI my hands aren't that big). The keys are chiclet style so the spacing is decent and it is quite tactile. I can type basically full speed on it (60+ wpm). For comparison, I feel like typing on this is easier than typing on my old MSI wind netbook(10 inch). I haven't any issues with it yet. I was happy to know that a lot of hotkeys I'm used to in windows worked here as well (alt-tab, ctrl-T in chrome, etc...). Some keys are placed in weird places due to the limited space (? key is beside the space bar, need to press fn to hit quotation marks) but it doesn't take too long to get used to it. The magnet that holds it is also very secure. You can hold it upside down and not worry.
The stand, for me, is usable on my lap. Since the keyboard is removable you can probably get creative with placement.
As for the cons, the biggest concern for me is that it would be cumbersome if I didn't want to use the keyboard. I can take the keyboard out and fold it back, but it just feels weird. Taking the tablet out, while not hard, is not the most convenient process in the world. I had originally intended to switch back and forth between this case and a moko ultra slim for when I didn't need the keyboard but now I'd prolly use this one most of the time because a) removing is a hassle, b) this case is awesome :). It's only been 1 day that I've had it, so my other concern is that it will hold up over time.
All in all I'm very impressed with this case, especially at this price and I'd definitely consider buying again for the Nexus 7 2014.""

At the end of this chat please take the time to fill out a brief survey and rate the overall experience at the top of the chat window. How can I help you today?

**Michael Jane**: Hi, I'm having problems with my new Nexus 7.

**Stephen-Rae**: I will be happy to assist you

What are the issues?

**Michael Jane**: These issues were reported with other users, and the bulk of it is erratic multi-touch. If I'm using 2 or more fingers on the screen at one time, there will be phantom or ghost touches in between.

Here is a youtube link that another person uploaded of the exact issue I'm having (If you can view it) ~~http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1cD-JXRGX8~~ (gave him the wrong link! oops! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZRiMiNzs0U)

**Stephen-Rae**: I am very sorry but I cannot view that link due to IT restrictions

**Michael Jane**: Okay, no problem.

**Stephen-Rae**: Based on the nature of this situation I would advise you to a data wipe. What this will do is to wipe everything off your tablet and set it back to the factory settings. With that said I would advise that you back-up your information ok?

**Michael Jane**: Okay.

I've already wiped once, and the problem still persists.

**Stephen-Rae**: I am sorry about that indeed

**Michael Jane**: The main part of my worries is if its just a software issue that can be resolved through an update, or if its a hardware issue.

**Stephen-Rae**: Based on the nature of this situation I would advise that you send it in for repairs.

**Michael Jane**: I'll see what I can do.

Thanks for the help

**Stephen-Rae**: If the reset does not work it would more than likely be a hardware issue

that would be solved by having it looked at by a technician
