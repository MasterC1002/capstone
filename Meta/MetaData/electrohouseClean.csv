There were many requests for the list to be **compiled and uploaded**, so here it is!

99% of the songs are 320kbps and range anywhere from 9 to 16mb. They are **all iTunes tagged**, ID'd and given standard album art. As you can imagine, the files are very heavy, so each folder contains approximately 12 songs. I have listened to all the songs on Sony MDR-V6 headphones, and they sound good. I can't verify for speakers, though.

**PART 1**

[Set 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?v9leefs6rnr9cux) 143MB

[Set 2](http://www.mediafire.com/?dp9d2tlbov8xds2) 173MB

[Set 4](http://www.mediafire.com/?5ibjmwk8on71k4z) 138MB

The only songs I could not find were Bingo Player's *Mode* and Dirty Rich's *Stun* (low quality). Instead, I included PrototypeRaptor's *Drive Hard*, OVERWERK's *Too Many Dicks* and Minero's remix of *You Missed a Spot* based on people's reactions in the comments/popularity. ~~I also uploaded the *Arena Mix* of Seek Bromance.~~ **Here's a [a link](http://www.mediafire.com/?611bi47hkthhf5a) to Seek Bromance if needed.**

**PART 2**

[Set 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?n8mrh9c8hn2qz56) 127MB

[Set 2](http://www.mediafire.com/?1a4o72rl550qq0n) 134MB

All of the songs from the ramin's first update except for Lazy Rich's (whose remix I included in Part 1). Also, I'm not sure if *Icarus* is the official version and *Party Rock Anthem* is 256kbps. Check out Lucky Date especially, stellar songs. 

**PART 3**

[Set 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?bf5ea6ry20qct3u) 160MB

All of the songs from ramin's second update except for DANK's *Fuckin' New York City*. I added Hirshee's remix of *Raw 2 Da Floor* (because it's as good as Lazy Rich's, also included). I accidentally uploaded these without changing the album art. You may now all downvote me to oblivion. 

[Set 2](http://www.mediafire.com/?z4qpf20b5wrai62) 78MB

Some songs **not on the original list** that I like a lot. Includes Martin Solveig, Mord Fustang, Dada Life and some delicious swinghouse. 

**MASHUPS**

[Set 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?6wbn1b4zhq9g6le) 80MB

Includes selections from Kap Slap, Basic Physics, DJ Trademark as well as our own contributor, Jeff Rowe.

On the other hand, though, this is a genre specific subreddit and unless we remove and downvote anything that's not electrohouse, we really just become a dancier version of /r/electronicmusic. It also doesn't help that every second post in /r/dubstep sends anything that doesn't have a half-time beat over to us...

2. **The weekly compilations!** This used to be, in my opinion, the single best thing we had as a community. It sucks that we don't do it in an official capacity anymore. My thought is to create a thread every single week where we can link to various posts from the last 7 days and then vote on what we all think should be on the compilation. I know you can sort by ""Top from last 7 days"", but I feel like this would bring back a sense of community to this place if it's a regular event every week that we all post in. From there I was thinking someone can volunteer to locate and assemble mp3s of each track, zip them up and throw them up on a file sharing site. As a reward... I don't know. I was thinking about brushing up on Reddit CSS and putting together some awesome, mega special flair for the people who put together a compilation every week. Something like the trophies you occasionally see in other subs. What do you guys think about this?

3. How do we feel about posts that are not directly related to electrohouse, but have some specific relevance to the party/club/festival scene? I'm not talking about festival line up announcements, but instead stuff like ""look what Steve Aoki just tweeted!"" or stuff like [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/105aay/dijon_francisi_was_a_little_drunk/)

I hope this doesn't come off as a sob-story, but I heard from a youtube channel that had uploaded some of my music that they were getting weird copyright claims. wut. So I listened to the track that adsense recognized. [(Check out the last two tracks of this release)](http://www.beatport.com/release/fml/1000882)... Now here are my two tracks [Amazon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lUMM4vOBY&amp;list=UUp6ETEozkhPs0vHhIRpu_bA&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plcp) and [Test Subject](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Q4r_fvg0s&amp;list=UUp6ETEozkhPs0vHhIRpu_bA&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plcp). What do I do? I'd be more flattered than angry except one of the tracks I released for free and the other in a 4 track EP that I made 2 bucks.

Every ""new banger"" is formulaic, almost to the point of rigidity. Almost every single producer is doing it- a build up, a pre-drop, a post drop, repeat. But even still, the only real difference between a lot of these songs is the selection of an alternate melody- most use the same sound clips to manipulate, the same distortions. It seems to be molding together before my very ears.

I've deviated from electrohouse entirely, listening solely to electronic such as Disclosure, Burial, Daft Punk's RAM, Uppermost, Lemaitre, and Justice (to name most of them, haha. if anyone has any recommendations like these, I'd love to hear them).

I love electronic music and I want to listen to electrohouse, but after recently going to Spring Awakening in Chicago, I don't think I'd want to see any more brostep/dubstep/electrohouse until there becomes an actual difference in the music.

I don't know if I've just become disenfranchised with the whole shtick, or if my concerns are felt by others. I'm not hating on the shows or the culture(by all means, if you enjoy them, please go), but it seems like the genre has stagnated almost across the board. Has anyone felt what I'm feeling, and is there a light at the end of the tunnel?

tl;dr: i feel like the genre as a whole has stagnated, and I don't want it to die. Are there any artists pushing the boundaries?"	t5_2ry9g	True

As you can most likely tell this volume of the /r/electrohouse compilations is extremely delayed and I apologize for that. Now that I have finished with the semester and have settled back at home, I hope to be able to get back on tack with these, at least for the summer. This volume was a bit tricky to put together since I did not keep a list for the top tracks at the time. I did my best to find them, but since there is no option to search within specific dates  I could not be sure these are the tracks from the correct time period. Regardless, the tracks included are the most upvoted tracks and they all are 320 kbps and are properly tagged. I welcome all feedback and love to hear any way to improve these compilations. Again, I apologize for the delay, but I hope you enjoy the tracks.

As you can tell I am late with this month's edition of the compilations. I apologize, but last week I had midterms and was buried with things to do. This week is a lot smoother so i was able to put it all together and bring you a new set of tracks. As always, the tracks are the most upvoted posts on /r/electrohouse and are all 320 kbps and have matching album art and taggings. Also shout out to /u/Cancer_Jesus for making a huge Mega folder of all the previous volumes which can be found [here](https://mega.co.nz/#F!MctQjboT!P6h22gvnlW8Jqt7Wd5FEtg). I was going to do something similar when I got the time, but I'm glad someone was able to do it quicker. Be sure to check it out if you are missing any! Happy listening everybody!

After hunting through the code, webpage, images and everything we have come to an end and discovered the following.



""Finale one last time,

The city was ours.

Icarus fell.

The pixel empire,

Came crashing down.

But we won't stop,

We can get it back.""



Most people keep wondering what it means, but to me i think it contains the titles of his EP to be released.



The tracks would be


1. Finale
2. The City
3. Icarus
4. Technicolor (The Pixel Empire)
5. Crashing Down
6. We Won't Stop
7. Get it Back

I have been attempting to download the /r/electrohouse compilations, and have been met with many, many dead mediafire download pages. 

Would someone be willing to put the time into putting up download links for the compilations (or even a torrent link)? I would appreciate it greatly, as would my music collection.

Well it has been a while since the last one. I apologize for the extremely long delay, but as I have mentioned I am currently attending school and found it hard to find time to gather these songs. I finally got through round one of midterms last week and was able to get the past month's top tracks compiled. Because there haven't been any compilations for the past few weeks, this volume has a rather large number of songs, (30 to be exact) so it is split into two downloads. As usual all the tracks are 320 kbps and include uniform artwork and tagging.  
  
As you all download it and check it out, let me know if monthly updates are better (the most upvoted songs over the course of a month) or weekly updates (most upvoted songs each week) are better for the community. I guess its a quality versus quantity thing, but I have gotten messages where people have suggested monthly updates instead of weekly. Feedback is always appreciated! Sorry for the delay/wall of text, thanks for listening, and enjoy the music!

What's up everybody?

So, as you may remember, about a month ago I watched John Denver all morning and was revved up as fuck, so I got all motivated and started organising the return of the /r/electrohouse weekly compilations.

Sadly I was then promptly fingered by exams and the compilations completely left my mind. For that I'd like to apologise, as apart from being a top cunt, I don't really have that much to do around here and so to dodge my one responsibility was a bit of a shitty thing to do.

For those among us with good memories, you'll know that my last thread detailed the procedure for throwing these together every week. For everybody else, the thread can [be seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/11i555/weekly_compilations/).

Since we're a smidgen behind, we're going to forgo the formalities and I'm releasing this week's compilation based on the top 10 tracks of the last seven days according to upvote count on the front page. (Sort by 'Top' and then 'This Week').

This is a one time thing just to get the ball rolling, and we'll try out the voting system for the next comp.

So, without further fucking around, here's /r/electrohouse weekly compilation volume 30!

1364811944.0	1bexg9	New /r/electrohouse rules		87	15	76	"Hey everyone!

I've been looking at the posting trends within /r/electrohouse and I've identified a fairly serious problem that I feel is watering down the quality of content posted here.

There are a *lot* of posts here from unknown or unsigned artists that are, frankly, not very good. It's probably up there at 8/10 songs posted are from some unknown producer, and I feel that we can't attract more readers to the subreddit without making some serious changes. When the front page is filled with names nobody recognises, it drives away newcomers to the scene and therefore drives away potential subscribers.

To combat this, we will be trialling a new rule in /r/electrohouse. Every post must be a track from an approved set of producers, which I will post below. Please note that you may suggest more producers to add to the list in the comments section, and if your comment receives enough upvotes then the mod team will consider adding your mentioned producer.

*Approved Producers*:

- Deadmau5

- Skrillex

- Daft Punk

- Lazy Rich

- Avicii

- Swedish House Mafia

- Dada Life

- Wolfgang Gartner

- David Guetta

- LMFAO

- Tiesto

- Knife Party

- Feed Me

- Dillon Francis

Please note that any tracks posted by a producer who is *not* on this list will result in a warning. Further infractions will result in a permanent, non-negotiable ban from /r/electrohouse.

Thanks all for your time and I look forward to seeing how this shift in direction goes :)"	t5_2ry9g	True

1335805011.0	szypr	Dear Soundcloud/Copyright Law,	WillMountain	81	15	14	"I'm Will, and I'm half of an electronic production duo named Antix hailing from Canada.

About two weeks ago, we decided that remixing Call Me Maybe would be our next project, as long as we could find a good quality vocal track to work around. On iTunes there is an album by ""Tribute Mega Stars"" that sold the individual tracks of the songs that seemed to be a cover of the original. To us, that seemed good enough and we bought them and were on our way. 

We finished the project on Sunday and immediately posted it on Soundcloud and YouTube, only to wake up this morning to find it had been pulled from Soundcloud due to copyright infringement. This, to us, is significant bullshit. We understand how copyright law is supposed to work technicall,y but we have never really seen the true vagueness in action. Previously we released a Taylor Swift remix that put us on the map to some extent both on Reddit and at our university in Hamilton, Canada. That remix singlehandedly has landed us over 3,000 views on YouTube and created a very small, but meaningful following. We figured that by finishing this project, while not making any money (in fact, making negative money) and providing it for free with the claim that we bought the tracks to remix (which is why it's on iTunes in the first place), we could further build on this following and gain just a little more recognition by remixing a recognizable song.

It has become apparent to us as fledgling musicians that the system doesn't work for people like us. The world of remixing is re-emerging as a very interesting and awesome way of expressing yourself, and at the level we're at, it's a great way to get your name out there. We've been asked to monetize our videos by YouTube and we've only submitted our two original songs to be monetized and even those got rejected outright. 

It's extremely frustrating to have to jump through legal, bureaucratic hoops when all you're trying to do is share a piece of music you've created using a vocal track you invested in, that was put online TO BE REMIXED. If we were making money off of this video/song, then yes, there is obviously a reason to take it down, but at the very least, it is free promotion for the original song, as if it needed any more promotion. 

I'm going to stop here, and I feel like I'm preaching to the choir, but a first-hand account of how unbelievably shitty the system is seems like something that can be discussed. I'm gonna shut up now and see if we can get our song back up.

Soundcloud, Hollywood, Governments of the world, get your head out of your collective asses and realize that the world is changing for the better. It usually isn't a good plan to try to force us to stay the way you want it to be.

1357616516.0	165v60	Who's going to blow up in 2013?		80	18	92	"So in the spirit of all these end of year lists, who are the small artists that you think are going to make it big in this coming year? 

RULES

1-The artist needs to have under 10 000 Facebook Likes. I think most people in this subreddit are fairly knowledgeable about electronic music. The goal of this thread is for people to find out about the next big thing, not just rave over guys we already know and love.

2-Include a link to your favourite track by said artist.

3-Keep it to a maximum of 10. We're going for quality not quantity.

4-Artists on your list must have a certain quality to them. Big DJ support, important blog coverage, record label releases, etc. are good indicators. Don't just throw in your own stuff and your buddy's shitty Skrillex remix. Let's go for the good stuff!!

On that note, here are the guys who have the most potential in my opinion and for whom the upcoming year should be big!!

1. [Charlie Darker] (https://soundcloud.com/charliedarker/atlantic-original-mix)

2. [Botnek] (https://soundcloud.com/dimmakrecords/supreme)

3. [GTA] (https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/gta-shake-dem)

4. [Torro Torro] (https://soundcloud.com/torrotorro/godeeptorrotorroremix)

5. [Conro] (https://soundcloud.com/conromusic/conro-axiom-preview)

6. [Nom de Strip] (https://soundcloud.com/nomdestrip/sets/nom-de-strip-peo-de-pitte-big)

7. [Will Sparks] (https://soundcloud.com/willsparks/will-sparks-ah-yeah-original)

8. [Tony Romera] (https://soundcloud.com/tonyromera/chuckie-promise-land-amanda)

9. [Funkin Matt] (https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/funkin-matt-i-wish-1)

10. [Popeska] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j18Rfem0y20)

There's a ton of guys in here that I forgot to mention or that didn't make the cut, but you all know there's a shit ton of talent out there. Keep adding to the list!!

Can't wait to hear who you guys like!

EDIT: I didn't think this post would get this much attention. Keep the suggestions coming, there are some great artists in here that I didn't know about and I'm hoping you guys have discovered some new music as well. Great music has to be shared and spread far and wide. Don't keep the gems to yourself, keep adding to this thread!!"	t5_2ry9g	True

1352493298.0	12xiqk	Great description of hit house tracks 	ilikeCRUNCHYturtles	61	3	20	"""The only really crucial thing to note here about the music is that the whole thing is about the bass. People who know a lot about electronic music will disagree with me, but knowing a lot about electronic music is, these days, entirely beside the point. The progression of a house track, and one plausible reason for house's ascendancy, goes like this: There's some twinkly pirouetting melody in the higher registers, then some bass for a while, and then the introduction of a soaring, optimistic vocal track about saving the world or, for the slightly less ambitious, having a feeling re tonight's bestness, then the simultaneous near-crescendo of the twinkles and the all-out vocal redemption, and then, right at the moment of presumed climax, the bass goes away for a few beats, everybody misses the bass so much and can't wait for it to come back, maybe the snare reintroduces itself after a few seconds to remind you to get excited for the prodigal bass's triumphal homecoming, a good DJ takes just longer than expected to bring the bass back, 20,000 or 50,000 hearts stop as one, lever arms hanging anxiously in midair, and then, when the bass kicks back in, the crowd goes out of their motherfucking minds, just like they did the time the bass disappeared and came back four minutes ago, pumping their right arms in genuinely exhilarated unison, survivors all of the briefly yet catastrophically lost bass."" - Gideon Lewis-Kraus in his article ['behind the scenes at EDC](http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201212/electric-daisy-carnival-edc-gq-december-2012?currentPage=1)"	t5_2ry9g	True

I've been aware of the subreddit /r/mixes for sometime, but have found it to be more for personal/fresh producers to post mixes rather than for large, well known artists. I've seen many posts of recent sets from EDCNY or Coachella or Jambalaya Festival and yet they really had no proper place for such threads. So, I went ahead and created /r/EDMsets for Redditors to post recent sets, or even general long mixes. 

One of my main desires for this is to be able to post such sets and then in the comments list the full track listings of the sets. If no track list can be found or obtained, then users could collaborate and figure out what tracks exist within the set and in what order.

Please pay a visit and check out what's posted as well as post some sets/mixes yourself. I'd also like to know if any other subreddits like this exist. Let me know, and thanks."	t5_2ry9g	True

I think I managed to hear from every single stereotypical partygoer: The sorority girl who thinks she's deciding what everybody wants to dance too (and screaming out boooo if it isnt her favorite song), The stoned dude who reaaaaally needs to hear this one rap song that he knows EVERYONE will love. That one dude ""im a DJ too, yeah, sweet turntables brah, imma just stand over your shoulder for a while""...

had two laser lights short out on me and stop working halfway through the set, along with a convienent powercord that managed to get tripped over several times and cut the power (ok maybe that one was poor planning on my part).

The dancefloor was packed the entire night and the line to get in was out the door and around the corner for a block so I suppose I shouldnt feel too down.

Anyways, I guess im asking, anyone have a night where they just feel like quitting afterwards? Could use a good few stories to make me feel better.

**edit:** Thanks yall, really love all the support and Ive been put in a great mood. And I'm really loving reading all these stories, glad Im not the only one who goes through a bad night now and again."	t5_2ry9g	True

Here's a quick comparison I did. It's in GBP but the Beatport-inflated prices should be similar everywhere.

I am not sure about VAT (at 20%) on each store. Beatport is definitely excluding VAT.

**Feed Me - Escape From Electric Mountain EP (6 tracks, released 6th February 2012)**

[Beatport:](http://www.beatport.com/release/feed-mes-escape-from-electric-mountain/867302) MP3: £8.03 / £1.30 per track, WAV/AIFF: £14.03 / £2.30 per track

Format information for each store (no stores mentioned use DRM):

* Beatport: 320kbps MP3, WAV, AIFF
* Junodownload: 320kbps MP3, WAV (192kbps MP3 is available but I don't know anything more about it)
* 7digital: 320kbps MP3, 320kbps M4A

Wow I'm actually somewhat on time with this month's compilation? Hopefully this month's is better than last weeks since last week there was various issues. The first issue was the album work being incorrectly labeled. The cover read ""Volume 44"" when it should have read ""Volume 46"" and I have fixed it [here](http://i.imgur.com/o8MMSd7.jpg). The second issue was with a song included in the compilation. The track titled ""Animals by Martin Garrix &amp; Sydney Samson"" was incorrectly titled and was also not the original mix. I have included the actual original mix in this month's compilation instead so please feel free to delete the other version.  
  This month's compilation features 16 tracks which were chosen based on the upvotes given by the community. All tracks are 320 kbps and include matching tags and artwork. If you see any issues with this compilation please feel free to let me know and I'll try to fix them. Any and all feedback is appreciated and helps improve the compilations. Also, (something that is not stressed enough) if you enjoy any of these tracks or any included in other compilations, please support the artists by purchasing the songs, attending concerts, or purchasing their merchandise! That is all! I hope you enjoy!
