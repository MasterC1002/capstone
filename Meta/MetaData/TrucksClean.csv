1363290541.0	1aaxsi	What a proper compounding, polish and wax can do to a truck.	Gundown64	43	4	16	"Got a chance to work on my truck this week. I've been wanting to really detail my truck right for over a year now, but things just haven't worked out. Anyway, finally got everything together and got to work. Took about 15 hours total to do everything, but it was worth it. First I washed and dried the truck well. Then I clayed the entire truck. After that I got into the good stuff. I used a Porter Cable 7424XP and various Lake Country pads. I started off by compounding the entire truck with Meguiars Ultimate Compound which removed most major scratches, swirls and streaks. Of course, some scratches and other imperfections can simply not be buffed out because they are so deep. That took about four hours. Second, I went over the entire truck again with a Meguiars Polish. This removed the remaining smaller and finer scratches and swirls that the compounding either missed or left behind. Another four hours there. This basically got the paint looking near new. Finally I finished the paint off with Mequiars NXT 2.0 wax with the porter cable. This of course protects the paint, but doesn't really do much to improve the shine. After all the hard work, the truck looks incredible. Other than a few scratches and nicks that can't be removed, the paint looks like it is brand new and has a mirror finish too it. Take a look through the following album and see the progression of the paint. If anyone would like more specifics i'd be glad to give them. Let me know what you think.

Make sure to read the descriptions at the bottom of the photos.
