I'm sad that I had to actually update the sidebar to include this, but as of today it is now official:  We forbid overly sexual comments directed towards a picture or post or poster.  

/r/tattoos is meant for tattoos, pictures of tattoos, and comments about tattoos.  That doesn't mean I'm going to strictly limit what each and every comment is about to make sure it's on topic, but it does mean that anyone - guy or girl - should be comfortable posting a picture of themselves here without a barrage of comments about them physically.  

Tattoos are on skin, and sometimes it's not really possible or feasible to take a picture of ONLY the tattoo, without surrounding body parts, and sometimes people don't have access to photo editing, blur, or whatever else you could think of to make the picture more PG.  

tldr: Don't be assholes.  Don't say things to people brave enough to expose parts of their bodies for the intention of showing off their tattoos that you wouldn't say to your mother."	t5_2qj9g	True

1363642072.0	1ajsfu	Right, I can't be the only one who feel's this way?	Toomm	827	246	126	It irritates me when sub par tattoo work gets upvoted purely because it's on the body of a good looking girl. I'm not trying to rain on anybody's parade, and I'll probably get downvoted to hell for posting this, but over and over again I see poor quality tattoos making it to the front page where as if they were tattooed on a man they wouldn't get more than a few upvotes. I think more people need to take into account the caliber of the technical work and quality of the design instead of upvoting with their cock. And I'll ignore the cringing attempts at underhanded flirting throughout the comments each time. Don't get me wrong I'd never want to insult someones tattoos and I love pretty girls, but when sloppy tattooing gets recognized more than quality work solely because it's on a good looking girl then you know this sub is heading in the wrong direction. This is not r/HotGirlsWithTattoos.	t5_2qj9g	True
