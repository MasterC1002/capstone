1357071219.0	15s8tn	The Official ListenToThis Best Of 2012: 607 artists, more than 50 hours of music across dozens of genres, and fifteen spotlight artists that deserve a little promotion to the rest of reddit. Happy new year, you crazy music lovers. :)	evilnight	2729	535	252	"Back in November, the mods of /r/music asked us to find a couple of obscure artists to promote to the rest of reddit. That request [took on a life of its own](http://redd.it/13d3j0) and has culminated with this submission. We figured new years was the best time to submit, as a lot of folks will have some time to enjoy a little music with the holiday.

We have several incredible artists to recommend, each with their own playlist linked below. They are virtually unknown, and aren't mentioned on reddit much outside of listentothis. We've tried to include a spectrum of styles so there should be something for everyone. Where possible, live performances and interviews with the artists have also been included in these playlists.

* [Shakey Graves](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynWkfFi4ApstMd4GT8Q5c1T) (blues, country, solo) compares favorably to Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, Hank Williams
* [The Oh Hellos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykdGsDzXjlNTISGdmteW1G4) (folk rock) if Mumford &amp; Sons leaves you bored, this is your fix
* [Listener](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymjs4EXlvu5m7wxBlSh_AM6) (talk music, poetry, raw emotion) everyone needs to hear the first video
* [Snowmine](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymC0KLuHgUgK8xTEgQwRaA0) (lush indie pop) remember when Coldplay was new and fresh? Like that, but better
* [Guante &amp; Big Cats](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMyl7QWfyhEKlUxeDEsXbXtsO) (underground hip-hop) political and with brilliant lyrics
* [Tak√©nobu](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykL2MYns-dp0aty7MP4xB_e) (classically styled cello, loops) similar to Kishi Bashi
* [Ott](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykbP7lJTetwdWrsWhfPpNYA) (psybient dub, chillwave) absolutely incredible soundscapes, pure mindfood, like Shpongle
* [Xanadu](https://soundcloud.com/brevans) (drum and bass) excellent D&amp;B artist, just gaining exposure
* [Darlingside](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynUhIXmT6EdyXzsNKpbLj5J) (string rock) many moods, many styles, great talent, great videos
* [//orangenoise](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymh50bp64FboBcttT-wJsgA) (shoegaze, punk, psychedelic, progressive) Pakistan has a kickass music scene
* [Golden Sun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymcDRRThuiq-LXLoe8jonlk) (hard rock, alternative) very popular with our submitters
* [Thank You Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMylBPBLFaZ1b3J89Y66OJIcO) (math rock, prog/jazz fusion) Coheed &amp; Cambria fans take note
* [Three Trapped Tigers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMyk131ePvwQZc7o4Ac_SHPlU) (hardcore math/noise rock) most ridiculously awesome video award
* [Dopapod](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykNOHWz7-L4Bd8bxc9VzwQ-) (jam band, rock, electronic, fusion, funk) killer live performances too
* [Kimmo Pohjonen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymPkOb284_IG9BtYP6db0zc) (experimental accordion) from the blow-your-mind department

Links to artist websites and places to purchase the music can be found in the *playlist descriptions.*

Out of all of these artists, Shakey Graves was voted the most talented and the least well known by a wide margin. What do you think, reddit? Can we get him a spot on [Later... with Jools Holland?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ml0l) What else can we do to promote musical artists on reddit?

---

Of course, that's not enough music for us. We listened to each and every artist submitted, found one of their best tracks, and put them into playlists so that everyone could easily surf through the resulting tsunami of music. We also visited some of the other music subreddits and included artists from threads they had already run. Turns out youtube has a playlist limit of 200 items, so the results were broken up into several playlists grouped loosely by the styles of music. Some are more effectively sorted than others due to the time it takes to arrange them using youtube's abysmal editing interface. Apologies to the metal, prog, electro, and post-rock fans for those lists being a bit messy - this was a learning experience and we know better what to do next time around. We might even have it automated. :)

* [Modern](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynck4QCPMjAOQr79Ot1yRDJ) (post-1980 styles, indie, alt, electro, hiphop etc) 173 artists, 11.47 hours
* [Sounds Vintage](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynU3rNYtRH-5z-MoZF8xcBv) (pre-1980 styles, funk, soul, rockabilly, folk, bluegrass etc) 167 artists, 11.33 hours
* [Heavy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMyk0BrQGk4moCWQPr6Hfo8ks) (hard rock, many kinds of metal) 116 artists, 15.15 hours
* [Electronic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMynnRITRY89z5a1yGkMNkNYr) (instrumentals, dub, dnb) 87 artists, 6.31 hours
* [Prog &amp; Post-Rock](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMykWk-xy8IBcqDFqH17_DxnK) (instrumental post-rock and some progressive rock) 50 artists, 5.42 duration

We have two more end of the year additions that aren't dedicated to obscure artists.

* [Subscriber's Favorites](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymJSx2v5jTkq9h3s0k7E4un) (top voted tracks of 2012) 62 tracks, 4.18 hours
* [ListenToThis 2012 Music Awards](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwkpk_HRkMymc5_PuQShrh76BI-nLPFc-) (because we love to be smartasses) 37 tracks, 2.56 hours

This is really just the tip of the iceberg, as the related tracks for these 607 obscure artists will lead you to thousands of others. This post should provide you with several days of musical exploration. Happy new year to everyone, we will definitely be doing this again in a couple of months.

Some folks are converting the youtube playlists into other formats. I'll link them here as they become available.

1358623541.0	16w0ac	[meta] It's time. This is the official Blacklist band thread. Tell us what bands should never be seen here in listentothis. Bands that make this list will be permanently banned by the automoderator. 	evilnight	1282	453	785	"Please vote this up for visibility, there's no karma from self posts and we want a *big* discussion about this.

The results of this discussion will become the baseline for our band blacklist, which will be maintained as a wiki page.

In addition to suggesting bands that should be placed on the initial blacklist, we need to determine a proper democratic process for including bands on this list in the future, something driven by your own comments on the submissions themselves. I was thinking of something along the lines of a comment like, ""I nominate this band for the Blacklist"" and then requiring a certain number (10? 20?) of ""yea"" replies to that nomination. Any band that meets the threshold is added to the blacklist and we never see it again.

By never, I mean *never* - no exceptions for live, rare, or new music.

**The Blacklist page itself will include links to audio on these bands (for example, Talking Heads would point to their wiki page and perhaps link to a youtube clip of Stop Making Sense). The point of this is to make sure that even though the bands are banned, people can still use that page for musical discovery.**

Keep in mind that this is NOT THE HOTLIST. We will have another list generated by another discussion like this LATER that will be for bands that aren't necessarily well known, but are getting reposted here far too often. We are also looking at implementing a repost-filter that will, for example, prevent new submissions from artists who have been posted more than twice in the past seven days. All of this comes later. For now, concentrate on the blacklist. :)

So, who goes on the initial list? Do we include bands from the blacklists in other subreddits?

---

Updates from the excellent discussions below...

* We will expand the use of the rare tag, so that it can bypass any/all of our blacklists. This will remain unless people abuse it for karma.

* We will be using a base metric to check for popularity. So far, this means that a band must have more than X hits on google, Y last.fm listeners, or Z youtube views on their videos in order to be on the list. The exact values of X/Y/Z are a matter of discussion below, but we will arrive at firm and fair values. At first brush, that appears to be something like meeting two of: 3 million google hits, 2 million last.fm listeners, or three youtube videos that total more than 5 million views.

* The blacklist page will include links to streams of the music from those bands, so that anyone who doesn't know about them can easily use the blacklist as a goldmine of excellent music. It'll probably become a more popular page than this subreddit itself.

---

One thing I need to point out to the rest of reddit coming in from /r/all - this is not asking for permission to implement the blacklist. That was asked and answered (and given a yea vote with a massive majority) in two previous rule review threads. You didn't see them? Not our problem, pay more attention, they were linked for nearly 18 months in the sidebar and in an announcement for two months, right up to when I put up *this* announcement you are reading now. The list is not even a new idea. We're very late to this particular party.

It is being implemented, and that's that. This discussion is to identify the best methods of implementation, so if you want to chime in, focus on being constructive and helping us figure that out. Many of these bands have been removed by the report system for the last two years *and you never even knew about that* unless you read the sub's rules... you know, the ones linked in the sidebar since day five of listentothis' existence. The blacklist will simply be automating that process. If you want it to be less restrictive, then say so, help us figure out where to draw the line, and it will be.

Before you flip out about this, read the threads below and *understand* it. 

**TL;DR: Popular music will be posted once and for all.**

1374602415.0	1iwc8n	[meta] Announcing the Official /r/Listentothis Music Multis. Hundreds of top music streaming subs categorized by activity level, topic, and genre. This is your gateway into reddit's world of music appreciation.	evilnight	936	128	81	"I hope you're sitting down with good headphones on. We've done several months of research to get this right, pulling all of this together is the result of extensive data mining over at [radd.it](http://radd.it/) and a lot of hard work by the /r/Listentothis mod team. /u/radd_it is directly responsible for the lion's share of this research. If you find this useful, consider a donation to his site. Making radd.it into reddit's most powerful media consumption tool is his goal and his only current employment - it works on far more than just music.

We've identified every music sub *on reddit* that gets more than five posts in a month. All of them are presented below for your listening pleasure. With two exceptions, all of these multis are for subreddits that feature streaming music submissions as the majority of their content. /u/radd_it has also worked hard to make the radd.it player compatible with these multis, and now it can turn their content into functional playlists. I'm including a listening link for each of these along with the multi itself. Just click on Play (works best in Chrome, Firefox).

We'd appreciate feedback. If there are music subs out there that are active (more than 5 posts a month) and we've missed them, we *need* to know about it so we can get them added to the appropriate multireddits and get them into the radd.it database. Oh, and /r/music is *not* included in any of these.

So, let's begin. The time has come to dispel the myth that music on reddit has a problem.

---

* **[Agora Musica](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/agoramusica)** We'll start with the ones that aren't about listening. This multi contains all of the various *musical discussion* subreddits, where talking about music, theory, bands, news, and trading recommendations is the norm. It's a great set. If you've been looking for a community of music lovers to *talk* to, this is what you're after.

* **[Music Makers](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** This second set of discussion subreddits is dedicated to people working in the industry or creating music, be it production, songwriting, teaching, playing in a band or just learning how to play an instrument. This multi represents reddit's cumulative musical knowledge set.

---

Topping the listening list is a trio of multis that contain every active listening sub on reddit. These are here for your own personal discovery. They are broken down by *activity level* not by subscribers! What's most active may surprise you. It certainly surprised us, and has very little to do with total subscription numbers.

* **[The Firehose](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thefirehose) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thefirehose?only=music))** View this one by new and refresh, you'll find out why it has that name. These are the 100 most active listening subreddits. Their submission rate is impossible to keep up with. It's more than double the content of /r/music. These are all vibrant communities.

* **[The Fountain](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thefountain) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thefountain?only=music))** The next 100 by activity level. These move at a leisurely pace, though in the aggregate they still produce quite a bit of listening content. These tend to be somewhat less frantic, less mainstream listening experiences, dedicated to niche genres and off the wall concepts.

* **[The Drip](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/thedrip) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/thedrip?only=music))** These are the lowest, yet still active, submission rates in the listening subreddit community. Often the rate is low because of a very narrow focus, or a lack of readership. Hopefully getting some of these overlooked gems a bit of exposure will get them moving again. In the aggregate they still produce enough content to justify looking at this one at least once a day.

The multis below have a heavy overlap with this trio, and were mostly created from them. Those above were created to aid in discovery, those below were created for listening. Many small subs that didn't make the top300 due to activity levels can also be found in the multis below.

---

We have a few multis dedicated to broad topics.

* **[TrueMusic](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/truemusic) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/truemusic?only=music))** This is our crown jewel. All of the most unique, most interesting, and best moderated listening subreddits are on this list. A trip through this content will change how you listen to music. This is the /r/Listentothis A-List. The content is subjective - if you know of any excellent ones left off this list, please recommend that it be included.

* **[Redditunes](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/redditunes) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/redditunes?only=music))** One hundred percent redditor-created content,  all being shared by the artist(s) who wrote and performed the music. These are the best places to go on reddit to give and get feedback.

* **[Vintage](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/vintage) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/vintage?only=music))** My own little guilty pleasure. All of these subreddits are dedicated, in one way or another, to pre-1980s sounds. Given the tremendous representation that electronic, indie, and other modern forms of music have on reddit, it seemed like a good idea to round up the classics, new and old, into their own set.

---

The most useful way to break these down is by genre. These multis are rather broad. We felt this was best so that people could see all a genre has to offer and then narrow their copies down to suit their tastes on their own. Some are small, some are massive. There is also some overlap in these multis, as many subreddits fit into more than one genre category. If you know of any actives that we missed, *please* reply here and let us know! I am certain there are a few unintentional omissions.

* **[Any](http://www.reddit.com/user/evilnight/m/any) ([Play](http://radd.it/user/evilnight/m/any?only=music))** music subs that allow any genres

All of these will soon be replacing the traditional /r/Listentothis sidebar subreddit links. You will always be able to find the most up to date versions here. Thanks to the multis we finally can include everyone! These may change slightly over the next couple of days as we update them based on your suggestions. Any new music listening communities on reddit should feel free to [PM the mods of /r/Listentothis](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flistentothis) at any time. We will add them to the appropriate multis. 

We may also add a few new multis to this list over the course of the day. 

**Suggestions for new multis in this set and any changes you'd like are welcomed.**

If you want to share your own music multis, feel free to do so in the comments.

Don't forget to check out /r/multihub. There's more than music on the prowl today...

Update: The Listentothis sidebar has now been reworked with these multis instead of the old subreddit lists. Also, [radd.it has added a listening page allowing you to browse through all of them.](http://radd.it/#music) One link on radd.it = every single music submission on reddit, outside of /r/music anyway."	t5_2qxzy	True

And even if they do it's usually because it's a cover of a famous song or it's some one-off youtube vid of some guy with freakish technical ability. Just browse the subreddit by top from this week, month, year and you'll see what I'm talking about (Frank Ocean, Bloc Party, The xx, Crystal Castles). I still prefer this to r/music, but I never feel like I'm actually discovering new music here.

I know the intention of the sub includes less heard tracks by famous bands, but these submissions always have a completely unfair advantage over actually good and unknown bands simply because of name recognition. The only /r/listentothis posts that make my frontpage are usually songs I've heard many times by now or the latest pitchfork darling. 

Looking at the sidebar I see that this sub has 91,864 subscribers so it's quickly entering shit territory, but let's see if we slow this down. Listen to the unknown artists and upvote accordingly, I really feel like unknown bands should take preference over the less heard tracks from well-known bands.

* Post as a comment on the thread your top 3 songs or albums of 2013

I'll make a youtube playlist out of it, as well as a Spotify one (that is if I can find your suggestions on spotify...) and post it here :

We would greatly appreciate it if everyone would leave a comment on each artist that they feel deserves the reddit bump. It'll help us narrow the list with something more meaningful than simple upvotes.

Edit: You guys are amazing. This thread is on *fire* with excellent submissions. 

[Playlists are taking shape at this link.](http://www.youtube.com/user/ListenToThisOfficial/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=1) They aren't in any sort of order at this point and change frequently as I shuffle videos around in a feeble attempt to mix them. Don't go sharing this around until it's actually finished. :) I got every artist mentioned in this thread, including those without links. The only ones that will be missing were those that didn't have something up on youtube or were already showing signs of getting noticed (millions of video views), which happened less than thirty times total.

The total haul here for the playlists was *four hundred and forty five under-appreciated artists.* Truly epic work, gentlemen. The floor is closed for submissions at this point. We'll do this again in the future. There's no way I have the time for this on a monthly basis, but we might manage every 3-4 months. It'll be easier with the wiki once that launches.

I still have to do two things - first, put the big playlists into some kind of coherent order, and second, create separate playlists focusing on each artist we're picking out as winners. It'll be more than five... perhaps as many as twenty, and with an effort to diversify genres in the results. If you see a playlist titled 'artist spotlight' appear you'll know that artist is going on the list.

This will be posted for a self-post friday, whenever I'm finally satisfied with the lists. :) It's going to take a lot of listening to get it all right and I don't want to rush things. There's simply too much good material to fuck this up by being hasty. You'll know something is done/finalized when a proper description appears attached to a given playlist.

There's always a little drama about where to draw that line, but generally speaking, the kinds of bands you often see on the top of /r/music are removed on sight around here in order to make room for less well known acts. It's not that we think of them as bad music. It's that we want to be more useful and concentrate on getting more exposure out to less well known acts. [Our full rules are listed here if you are interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette)

You can get a great idea of what we are about by checking out our **[best of 2012 roundup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/15s8tn/the_official_listentothis_best_of_2012_607/)** The ['obscure artist thread'](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/199b6e/lets_try_a_new_thing/) linked above will be processed into another one of these kinds of posts in the next month or two. We'd love to get your submissions and opinions on the submissions already shared there.

Our sidebar links to many of the other best music subreddits. No matter what your taste, there's a subreddit to cater to it. Take some time and check out these other excellent communities. For those of you on mobile who can't see the sidebar right now, you can view it by clicking on [this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/about/sidebar)

If there are any really hardcore music lovers out there who tear through album after album every week, we want to hear from you and we want you to stick around and submit. You are the people that make this place great every single day. Stop over in our sister subreddit /r/listentous and participate in an election - show the reddit music elitists what you are made of. Subscribe over at /r/letstalkmusic for the best music discussions anywhere on reddit.

There are mobile apps for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rplaylister.rplaylisterandroid) and [Apple](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id502389053?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4) so you can stream our submissions (and those of any other music subreddit or combination of them) anywhere.

Last, we have an experimental media viewer/player brewing up over at [radd.it](http://radd.it/r/listentothis) that can process all of the media in any thread, be it music, videos, or images, into an easy to view and context aware format. This is still experimental, but our hope is that it eventually becomes as indispensable as imgur. Radd.it is created and maintained by the brilliant /u/listentous... and his cat.

Swing by /r/radioreddit for music created by and curated by redditors. If you are a musician, swing by /r/wearethemusicmakers for advice and consider submitting your music here and on radioreddit for everyone to enjoy.

1374086116.0	1ii3wt	[meta] We need to talk about a proposal for a major change that the mods have been debating. There exists a way to split Listentothis into different 'editions.' We'd like your opinion on the wisdom or foolishness of this idea and how best to implement it if we go forward.	evilnight	423	74	199	"Reddit has a little known feature... you can prefix reddit.com with any two alphabetic characters and it will still work. You can have http://aa.reddit.com/r/listentothis and http://ab.reddit.com/r/listentothis et cetera. That's a total of 676 combinations. Each of these can have its own unique CSS stylesheet. This has been used quite a bit in other subreddits to load different themes, globally show/hide spoilers, and to manage the whole 'no participation' concept used in some of the meta discussion reddits.

/u/multi-mod mentioned he could use this to create different *editions* of listentothis in combination with clever use of flair. After we made him explain what this means and how it works, the mod discussions got pretty... interesting. I was initially opposed but after thinking it over it isn't quite as crazy as it seems at first glance.

Imagine something like this...

* http://hv.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Heavy' Edition. Only submissions containing genre tags like metal, hard rock, stoner, hardcore, punk, etc are visible. The sub looks similar, but styled more in line with heavy music and darker colors.

* http://in.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Indie' Edition. Anything tagged with indie, pop, twee, etc.

* http://em.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Electronic' edition. Only electronic music submissions are visible.

* http://os.reddit.com/r/listentothis - The 'Obscure' edition. Only tracks with fewer than 100k last.fm listeners. This gets a bit tricky but it should still be doable. ~~(It's a flair-multiplication problem).~~ We could even run a mainstream edition and *relax* the popularity rules. 

~~By flair multiplication I mean this... if we have a heavy edition, a curated edition, and an obscure edition, we need flair for heavy, heavy-curated, heavy-obscure-curated, heavy-obscure. Getting all of these tags to work and look good is a major time consuming pain in the ass, so we need to be careful how we set this up.~~

You get the idea. The main /r/Listentothis would of course remain unaffected and still contain all submissions. Bots can *very easily* manage the flair tagging needed to make this happen - as long as our submitters continue to use genre tags it'll work no problem.

Why would we want to do this? 

* People here for just one group of sounds/styles will be more easily able to find them, and they won't have to wade through music they dislike to do it.
* This may reduce the love/hate genre problem that has driven metal into /r/headbangtothis and most hip-hop out of listentothis. Love/hate genres don't do well here. Too much downvoting even though it is against the rules.
* Our submission rate is now hovering just over 200 tracks a day. On January 1 it was at 120. Care to guess what it will be in 2014? 2015? It's getting beyond our ability to control. Splitting it up into subgroups helps keep people focused on what they like and reduces the noise from things they aren't interested in. It slows things down a bit even though the total submission count continues to rise.
* We can put genre champions in charge of each of these editions. These are special mods that are meant to represent the interests of that particular sub-group and be knowledgeable about that particular sphere of music.

If we had thought of this two years ago... we might have had a lot fewer splinter subreddits, and it's certainly not too late yet. If this works out I'm willing to re-integrate any other communities, +mod their moderators and put them in charge of their respective listentothis edition. What we have to offer them is greater visibility. What they have to offer us is genre-specific knowledge and their valuable time curating their editions.

There would be a series of tabs up at the top in the header, one for each edition we create. Clicking one would take you to that edition of listentothis. Each edition can also have its own curated tab.

One side note: These editions *would not function* unless you have subreddit styles enabled. They rely on the CSS changes for their functionality. I don't think this would work out well on any of the mobile reddit apps, either. You'd need to be using a proper web browser, not AlienBlue.

Yes, we can make the radd.it player edition-aware.

As far as I know, this has never been attempted before on reddit. Communities spin off into other subs instead. I have absolutely no idea how this would work out if we did it.

Obviously, if this happens, it's going to radically alter how we deal with popular submissions - all of the blacklist/hotlist chatter may turn out to be unnecessary. This is a fundamental change... and a very clever reddit hack to make it function.

---

So, the question becomes... is this a worthwhile endeavor? Do you think you would get value out of changes like this? If so, how exactly do we decide what kinds of editions to create, and what groups of music lovers are most comfortable being neighbors with each other in the various editions? What kind of editions would you like to see?

This is very much in the brainstorming phase right now, so feel free to jump in and share your opinion. More feedback always results in better ideas.

---

**Ok, consensus is clearly ""go for it"" so we're experimenting and trying things out.** ~~I have a bit of bad news, though... the exclusion-based editions are simply not possible in reddit's framework due to the link multiplication problem. For us to have 15 tags, then allow users to exclude 4, would require more than a thousand links. We can't have more than about 600 within reddit's framework nor are we able to put in that much work on something that amounts to a gross CSS hack. We might be able to do a couple of exclusion editions, but only a couple. We can tell you how to roll your own with the search, though. There will be a wiki page for that in the future.~~

Haha, disregard that. Workaround(s) discovered! Thank you /u/radd_it and /u/multi-mod. There are still some limitations... but they aren't very limiting. Here are some experimental editions, not finished or styled yet but just to give you an idea...

* [No POP, RAP, or HIPHOP edition](http://zc.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=-pop+-rap+-hiphop&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)
* [Rock edition](http://zb.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=rock&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)
* 2013 edition implemented via /r/listentonew 
* [Punk edition](http://zz.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=punk&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

Note: Curated content system is being removed and reimplemented as something an order of magnitude better than the previous incarnation. It will be its own edition at /r/listentocurated, and oh so much more than a listentothis-only system. It'll be active in every music subreddit.

(For our regular subscribers who have no idea why I'm posting this, check out [the YSK post plugging listentothis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1ianvk/ysk_that_there_are_a_lot_of_interesting/))

This sub was formed due to /r/music's total failure to get new artists and diverse kinds of music any visibility on reddit. Four years on we are the largest non-default music subreddit and are, more or less, the first stop on discovering the *hundreds* of incredible musical communities that are hidden in the smaller subreddits.

The submission in the original YSK thread was a bit misleading. If you want to see what listentothis is all about, you need look no farther than our **[best of 2012 roundup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/15s8tn/the_official_listentothis_best_of_2012_607/)** Anyone who hasn't been to that thread before should check it out, but be warned, it's quite a timesink. There's another one of these coming along tentatively next weekend. We eventually want to do these every three months, but we need a larger team of music lovers to handle that kind of workload.

I *strongly* suggest you check out the subreddits linked in [our sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/about/sidebar) You'll find that whatever your musical taste, there is almost certainly a subreddit, in some cases an entire network of subreddits, dedicated to that kind of music.

If you check out the 'listening tools' section of the sidebar you will find free mobile apps and various websites that can turn the content of any musical subreddit into an ongoing playlist for easy listening. radd.it is the best of these and was created by one of our moderators.

You may notice we have a ['curated' tab](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=flair%3A%22curated%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) up top (unless you have styles disabled) which is [an ongoing project](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/curators) here to shine a spotlight on the best submissions. We have 200 redditors with curator access, any of them can flag any submission as curated. Basically all this means is that some music snob heard the track and went running off in glee to find everything by that artist. Tastes vary, which is why we need so many curators to catch all of the gems flowing through here.

Listentothis encourages *all* styles of music, so you'll find metal sitting next to dubstep, folk, and pop tracks. Don't downvote the genres you dislike, just move on or click hide. Try out some of these other genres from time to time and you may surprise yourself with what you like.

We do get a lot of *bad* music submitted here. Part of what listentothis does is wade through all of that and try to find the gems for you so that you don't have to put in the time it takes to listen to 120 submissions a day. The best gems our mods and curators can find end up on the curated tab and in these large roundup threads like the best of 2012 linked above.

If you decide you want to stick around, please [read our subreddit rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) Those are due for a major rewrite in the near future, but they are still accurate. The presentation needs a bit of work. [This rules thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/1g4pky/anncmnt_rlistentothis_submission_rules_and/) is a bit more up to date and will also give you insight into why the rules are the way they are and how we go about moderating around here.

Also, don't just expect the best of listentothis to bubble up to your front page. Music doesn't really work like that on reddit due to the time investment it takes to listen to entire tracks (a couple of minutes) vs images (a few seconds). Quick-consume content will always get to the top first and stay there longer - and nothing about good music is quick to consume. Visit listentothis directly once a week, and check out the new curated tracks and the most upvoted submissions. That's how to get our best.

If anyone is interested in becoming a curator or a moderator, drop by /r/listentous tomorrow when we will be having a general election (sometime around noon est). Curators must win one election, moderators need to win three, and then we talk. :)

I run a radio show on student radio where we only play songs that have 40,000 views or less on youtube. You get the idea: we play very unheard of music.

I owe you guys a huge thank you cause without you I probably wouldn't be able to create a playlist of awesome music every week, and make the show the mini success it's become!

So thank you and merry christmas!

EDIT: Thanks again for the help since this post! If anybody is interested in submitting music to the show then you can do so by PMing me or posting on the facebook page here: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sub-40/433007626752354?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts

For reference - I'm open to playing any kind of music but my own preferences are rock/indie music so that's the kind that gets through more easily. But I'm certainly not averse to extending my reach

EDIT 2: Thanks so much for all your suggestions on the PMs - I've had a lot come through and i'm trying my best to reply to each and every one of them. I'm on my winter break so the social calendar is rather hectic so please don't be upset if I take a little while to respond! I promise to listen to all your suggestions

FINAL EDIT BEFORE BED: If anybody is interested to hear what the show sounds like let me know and I'll post one of the podcasts from the most recent term of shows. I'm British just so that everyone is aware, and am guilty of carrying an Estuary English accent"	t5_2qxzy	True

Total number of reports? 0. 

**This subreddit is for new, rare and old bands, artists, tracks or collaborations.** 

I ban mainstream music if I catch it early enough that there isn't a massive discussion going on. I catch it if you report it because reports put links in a [special box](http://i.imgur.com/PFSOl.png). If it's not reported, I probably won't see it and it will fill up the front page along with the rest of the Billboard Top 100.

 I would also like to have a couple of other people to help out with picking out the albums so we can get a diverse selection.

I feel like this can help expose people to new artists and will also encourage people to expand their horizons.

The rules are simple. Top-level replies to this post should include the name of the artist and the name of the album/EP, and a link to listen to the album or at least a track from it. Submit as many picks as you like. Our usual rules about popularity are of course suspended for this poll. The votes alone will decide popularity for a change, so vote wisely.

There's no need to vote for just one. Vote up ALL of the artists that you think are worth a mention. It's called [approval voting,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) and while we can't seem to use it for democratic elections we can sure as hell use it for picking the best new artists. :)

All submissions should be artists whose first releases happened in 2011. It's ok if they had a few tracks or an EP prior to 2011, as long as they released their first album in 2011. Any genre is fair game, so please *do not* vote based on genre. After the week is out we'll compile a list and a playlist from the submissions. Have at it. :)

I suspect many of the artists you will wish to submit have tracks up on [bandcamp,](http://bandcamp.com/) [soundcloud,](http://soundcloud.com/) [reverbnation,](http://www.reverbnation.com/) and [grooveshark,](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=grooveshark&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrooveshark.com%2F&amp;ei=A_DcTtzuBem2sQL87ZXwDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwPgcAlOqhAZcXe49L7my_KUv2bg&amp;cad=rja) if you are looking for links to share.

EDT: user /u/radd_it made our hunt for easily consumable music from /r/ListenToThis [much easier](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/1bq5ih/listentomarch_2013_the_grooveshark_playlist_of/c99141j): 

&gt;My ears, they's a burnin'!  No reason for me not to reply to your message here.  
&gt;
&gt;So you want a playlist of the top tracks in r/listentothis for the last month?  To see them on reddit, you'd normally go to:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/top?sort=top&amp;t=month
&gt;
&gt;If you wanted radd.it to build a playlist you'd just replace the ""www.reddit.com"" bits with ""radd.it"" giving you:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://radd.it/r/listentothis/top?sort=top&amp;t=month
&gt;
&gt;*But wait*, you may be thinking, *that's all the top posts, I just want the music!*  Well, ok. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; http://radd.it/r/listentothis/top?sort=top&amp;t=month&amp;only=music
&gt;
&gt;*Holy shit!* you're hopefully thinking, *but what if I want to save that particular playlist?*  There's an ""export"" button under ""playlists"".
&gt;
&gt;*radd.it-- it can do that*."	t5_2qxzy	True

How about we get a single in the charts a week today and give everything to a little hospital in Africa?	alltheyadayadayada	354	88	40	"So a lot of people have been asking us to release something for download. Well my brother works during the summer at an incredibly amazing but underfunded hospital in Malawi, they deal with crazy amounts of suffering and poverty and could really use some help. Here's his blog: http://aliinmalawi.blogspot.com/

If you'll help us get a song in the top 40 a week today we'll give 100% away to them for Christmas. This is could be incredible for them, and a nice rebellion against the X Factor christmas singles. What say you people of Reddit? You have plucked us from obscurity, let's do something cool!

Signup here if you're in and we'll send out details to download the single:

i just genuinely like the fact that i have somewhere to come and have people give me their thoughts about what ive been working on. sometimes at 3am, when you should have gone to sleep hours prior, and your motivation is waning, its hard to think of a reason to try one more take, one more song, one more minute. but knowing that there is atleast  one person out there who will give it a listen and give me their thoughts makes a difference. it seems small. but its one hell of a difference. 


just felt like sharing. thanks again.

1323438491.0	n67qu	I'd like to announce two new subreddits that may be relevant to your interests.		343	92	37	"I'd like to let you all know about a new subreddit: [/r/under10k](/r/under10k). This subreddit is dedicated to artists whose most popular video has under 10,000 views on YouTube, and less than 10,000 listeners on last.fm. I'd like to take a moment and answer some the main question I see arising from this post:

Q. How is this any different than [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis)?

A. Really, in no way is [/r/under10k](/r/under10k) competing with [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis). [/r/under10k](/r/under10k) addresses a small niche of people on [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis). They are the people who would leave the record store with a new record under their arm, chosen simply because the cover caught their eye. They are the people who know a wide array of music, and are interested in hearing some artists that they'd probably not hear otherwise. I love [/r/listentothis](/r/listentothis), but I often see the posts that are fitting for [/r/under10k](/r/under10k) get no comments or upvotes here. This new subreddit is a place for those posts, and those posts only.

I'd be happy to answer any other questions you all may have.

----------

The second subreddit is [/r/recordstore](/r/recordstore). If you've ever wanted to work in a record store, answering people's questions, now's your chance. It's a place you can go to get advice on what artists are best to get into X genre, or what artists you'd like if you enjoyed X artist, and all the many other questions that you may have. I'm trying to figure out how to setup flair, and as soon as I do I am going to use flair to designate experts in particular genres. Do you know a lot about post-punk? Come show that knowledge off and you'll get flair letting people know you work in the post-punk section."	t5_2qxzy	True

1323859748.0	nc9na	Remember kids: Mixes and personal bands aren't exempt from the title format rules. 	happybadger	262	65	7	"I've just banned five or six of them that were submitted within the past few hours. This is not good. We use a standardised format, **Artist - Song [Genre/Genre] Comments**, for three reasons:

1. It may train the spam filter. Nobody is quite sure how it works, but most of the submissions that are caught deviate from the format. I will not unban these. The logic is that spam filter learns from us on what to expect in a title/link, which is then compounded with things like account age and activity (both overall and within the subreddit, including posting frequency and number of banned submissions) to calculate whether or not to allow a post. That may be flawed, but it seems to work. 

2. It lets the listener know what they're about to hear. There are some genres which I don't want to listen to sometimes. There are some genres I might want more exposure to. 

3. It looks nice. It's great that you listed every band ever made in the title for your hour long classic rock dubstep mix, but against a wall of clean titles it looks like a bloated mess. 

This is a warning that I'm ramping up my own moderation to fit this new crop of bad post titles. If you cannot follow the rules we link on the sidebar, there are subreddits which don't feature them and by all means you are completely free to jump ship. "	t5_2qxzy	True

Reddit gold is waiting for the top5 submitters. *ROUND TWO!*	evilnight	248	51	531	"We haven't done this since 2010 and it was a lot of fun last time. Here's how it works. **The rules are simple.**

**Top Level comments are categories. You make them up,** and the only rule for categories is that **if the category exists in a mainstream award show, you can't use it** - so no best new artist or best contemporary jazz album for example. **Be creative.** You can even be ridiculous. Best Hurdy-Gurdy Solo, for example. That's ridiculous.

**Replies are the nominees, with links to audio** tracks or (if applicable) albums that fit the category so that we can all listen and judge for ourselves. **If there is no link, then it doesn't count!**

The top voted submissions of the five top voted categories after the thread dies down will get reddit gold.

**Submit as many categories and nominees as you like, and vote on everything.**

I didn't think it needed to be said, but ***Keep it focused on music from 2012!*** Otherwise we're going to end up with predictable and boring results. This is a music discovery subreddit, after all. :P

***[Link to ROUND ONE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/1563rg/the_2012_music_awards_reddit_edition_you_pick_the/?sort=top)***

The reason we're running multiple rounds is that the way reddit's comments work, you don't get many views on late submitted categories. Doing it this way we get much better turnover. **The top categories for round one are pretty well cooked at this point.** Feel free to submit your category/nominees again if they didn't get noticed in round one!

Round two will run overnight to get more feedback from non-american redditors. :) 

***Vote these up for visibility, not getting karma etc etc.*** We need to attract more voters!!!

I will hide the round one thread once this one is getting up the hot page. We don't want to clog people's front pages. :)"	t5_2qxzy	True

Here are a few guidelines:

- One song per comment. 
- I will only take parent comments (so if you suggest a song as a reply to another song, I won't see it)
- After this post is 48 hours old I will compile a list of the top voted songs and give you Spotify, Rdio, and Grooveshark playlists.
- Songs must be from at least December 1, 2012 - this is a 2013 playlist after all.
- Let's focus on tracks that are somewhat forgotten or haven't had 'their break' (see: sidebar). Use some discretion here (or the search bar). For reference: let's assume everyone has well and truly heard Daft Punk.

Yabish?

I'll get us going: [√ìlafur Arnalds ft. Arn√≥r Dan - Old Skin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXkc2GLPl6I)

1327417503.0	oui8d	I've created some YouTube playlists for my music discovery project. Enjoy :)	cymru-beats	211	30	26	"Hi listentothis,

In the past couple of years I've listened to around 2000 different albums. I found a lot of great and relatively unknown stuff. I've decided to post a daily song to Reddit ([r/themvoices](http://www.reddit.com/r/themvoices)).

After about 150 such posts, I was urged to create some kind of playlist for a more convenient listening, so I created a YouTube list for each month.

I thought that the greater Reddit community might be interested in them, so I publish them here. You can just play them in the background and find some nice music. They are very eclectic and contain many different genres.

The playlists: (each has around 25-30 songs).

This thread covers Feb-Aug 2012.	evilnight	211	32	50	"This is our bi-annual review thread. We bring this up every six months to get feedback on how listentothis operates, let our regulars know how things are going, and to educate new subscribers. Please read this over and chime in if you have suggestions or questions.

The [last thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/j3bm8/some_tips_to_get_your_submissions_through/) has expired and no longer accepts new comments. This is the new thread.

**If you want the TL;DR version, just read the bolded text.**

---

**Statistics**

**We're gaining ~180 subscribers a day** (up from 100 six months ago) and we've added 20,000 subscribers since the last review. **We're getting about 125 *approved* submissions a day,** a bit less on the weekends with Sunday being the slowest. Roughly 50 submissions get blocked in the same time period. Of that 50, around 10 are blocked for being too popular or too frequently posted. The remaining 40 are blocked because they are missing the required artist, title, and genre tags. 

Generally, the people who aren't following the format aren't posting anything noteworthy. It's become a kind of secondary crap-filter. Peak submission times are 8AM EST through 11AM EST, and 5PM through 8PM EST (arriving at work and home for most Americans). Peak viewing time is around 11AM EST through 2PM EST (lunch for most Americans.) **If you want to get noticed, morning is the best time to submit.**

Out of the 125 submissions approved, around 40 are unknown bands. The next 40 are passingly familiar to listentothis regulars and new music hounds. The next 30 are popular enough to show up on satellite radio, are listentothis favorites, or nostalgia posts of bands that were popular years ago. Then there are ten that are fairly well known to everyone, typically the most popular artists on internet sites during the last month, or something that was on television or in the movies recently.

Even after two years, prior popularity is still the primary factor in upvotes. It is still rare for an exceptional track by an unknown band to break 200+ upvotes. The only people who have the power to change this are those who hang out on our new page and vote up the good tracks by unknown artists.

That's an average day in the life of listentothis.

**Reddiquette**

**Listentothis is *heavily* moderated** - one of the most heavily moderated communities on reddit, in fact. All of this moderation has one goal, and that's to keep the quality of the content here as high as reddit's framework will allow. We do not operate like the rest of reddit. This is a summary of our rediquette, broken up into three groups.

**For our listeners...**

* **We *are biased against* music that is already popular by definition here. If you've already heard the track, then DO NOT upvote.** This is our cardinal rule. The internet is full of websites dedicated to popular music. There are very few dedicated to finding and promoting obscure music, and that's the niche we strive to fill. Our goal is to help you find your next musical addiction, not relive past favorites.

* **We depend on the community for our definition of popularity.** **If you see a track that, in your opinion, is too popular** (used on TV, heard on radio frequently, got a band into the hall of fame, top40, see the artist here five times in a week, etc) then **click on ""report""** under the submission title. The mods review the report list frequently. Note: a report doesn't guarantee removal. It just guarantees a mod will look at it and make a decision. The more people who report, the more even-handed the moderation becomes, and the better an idea the moderators have of what our listeners consider to be popular.

* **We make three exceptions to the popularity rule.** **New** music by popular bands (by anyone, really) is given a free pass for a time after release. **Live** clips of popular bands are permitted *at moderator discretion,* and generally allowed unless we are getting buried under them. **Rare** tracks by popular bands are also allowed, but are, as their name implies, rare.

* **We prefer to err on the too-permissive side of things.** Don't flip out if the occasional popular track or two are at the top of the hot page. Flip out when they *dominate* the hot page. Then report. 

* **Viewing by [new](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/new/) is a better way to enjoy listentothis if you are interested in the obscure music. The majority of the freshest, best content here rarely makes it past 30 upvotes. If you view only the hot page all day, you've got no idea what's lurking under the surface here, and you're missing out.**

**For our submitters...**

* **Submissions are *required* to contain three things:** The name of the **artist,** the **title** of the track (or the album), and at least one **genre** tag describing the style of the music. All submissions that don't have these three bits of information will be removed, no excuses, no exceptions.

* **The submission title format of: 'artistName - trackName [genre tags] comments' is now *strictly* enforced by the [automoderator bot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q50ba/the_automoderator_bot_is_now_active_in_this/)** Submissions that don't match will be auto-removed, and a reply will be made to them clearly stating these rules and a list of acceptable genre tags.

* **Avoid using *indie* or *alternative* or tags that do not describe the *sound* of the band.**  We prefer tags like folk, rock, pop, upbeat, ambient, shoegaze, classical, jazz, bluegrass, metal, acoustic, blues, electronic, psychedelic, chiptune, hip-hop, etc. ""Indie Pop"" or ""Alternative Rock"" are fine, however.

* **If it's your own music or your friend's band, we still require the artist-track-genre in the title.** Submit like it is any other track. If your title is a variation of ""Hey guys check out my friend's band"" or ""awesome new track what does listentothis think"" or ""My cousin is so awesome"" it is guaranteed to be removed the instant a moderator sees it.

* **If it is *new* or *rare* or *live* or *nsfw* please tag it as such.** These tags help us make sure that those tracks get special consideration during moderation. If you submit a new release from a popular artist without tagging it as new, moderators may assume it is old and remove it. If it's a kick ass music video, please say so. Some of us do remember when MTV played music, and love a good video.

* **Remixes and covers are fine,** and are judged based on the popularity of the band *performing the cover,* not the band that originally made the music. When tagging remixes or covers, please provide more genre information than just [remix] or [cover] or [mashup]. Try for [acoustic cover] or [electro mashup.]

* Your submission titles are not limited to just those bits of information - feel free to say anything else you like, but try to **avoid gushing about the artist in your titles.** If you use words like ""best"" and ""epic"" be aware the voters will judge you (often harshly) on those claims. 

* **Please check the search box on the right to see if the band or track you are posting has been posted recently. If it's been over a month, or the original was under 10 upvotes, a repost isn't so bad.** If they've been here five times just this month, or have hundreds of upvotes, post something else or at least a different track by that band. When in doubt, a good live performance is always a safe bet. **If you get pages of results for a band, we aren't interested in them unless it's *new* or *live* material.**

* **Do *not* flood us with multiple tracks from the same band all at once.** If you want to share multiple tracks, space them out over several days. The mods will remove all but one track if this happens. If you want to post multiples all at once, then submit *one* track and post the rest in the comments of that submission. **Do not continually repost the same track over and over every day or week.**

* **Submitting entire albums as a *single* submission is fine,** provided it is not blatant piracy and you can link us to a legitimate streaming resource.

* **Submitting [playlists](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=playlist&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on) or your own mixtape compilations is fine** as well, but we'd appreciate it if you avoid the lazy 'songs I'm listening to right now' variety and took the time to theme your playlist or mix to give it a unique identity and some artistic punch. Tag it properly so people know what to expect. [Grooveshark](http://listen.grooveshark.com/) playlists embed directly in reddit now making them the best way to share.

* *Other* content is allowed provided it pertains to music in some way - such as documentaries on genres or bands, live concerts, etc. There should always be something to listen to in it.

* **Our sidebar over there ==&gt; contains links to many of reddit's best musical communities. Take the time to pay some of them a visit.** Chances are if you have a specific genre you love, there's already a well-stocked subreddit just for that genre of music. Others have multiple genres but different guidelines on what to post.

**For promoters...**

* There's been a rise in bands (and agents) spamming submissions and comments (which we actively block if it becomes abusive). **Artists are welcome to submit their own tracks as long as they follow the aforementioned rules. Other interests, if they want our attention, should buy cheap [sponsored links.](http://www.reddit.com/ad_inq/)** This will put their tracks at the top of subscriber's pages and the top of our hot page, guaranteeing they get noticed.

---

The floor is open for discussion about the rules, changes anyone would like to suggest, or if anyone has questions. Moderators will be keeping tabs on this thread for the next six months, and it'll be linked in the sidebar.

Enjoy the music. :)

This is only partly due to Digg's recent demise - mostly it stems from people posting links to listentothis on youtube comments and various music-related websites like last.fm, hypem, etc. Edit: Case in point, we've gained nearly 300 subscribers since I made this post. 

The upshot is we've had a rise in downvoting, repeated posting of popular bands, and posts not following the *required* format. We need to clean things up a bit. With that in mind we've updated the [listentothis FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/listentothis) to reflect [previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/d276v/the_black_keys_phoenix_pink_floyd_i_think_it/) [discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/8sith/cmon_guys_lets_try_to_keep_the_music_here_a_bit/) about how we manage our content. This place does not run like the rest of reddit.

New users should check out that FAQ, everything you need to know to get the most out of this place is in there. Once you're up to speed on the etiquette, regale us with your best tracks and we'll be delighted to listen.

New users should also visit [redditunes.](http://www.redditunes.com/playlists.php) Every track posted to every music subreddit is still in there. Review our [top](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/top/) posts, and you'll get a good idea of the community here as well.

---

We have a new job for our users - particularly, the listentothis junkies who hang out on our front page every day. 

If you're getting sick of seeing a particular band over and over, report it. Every time you see a track that, in your opinion, does not belong here (too popular, bad formatting, blogspam, etc) click on the report link under the post.  The more people we have registering these reports, the easier it is for the moderators to manage the content and keep the front page clear for new musical discoveries. 

These reports act like a poll and help us to tell when listentothis is tired of seeing specific bands. We do not want to get into a position where we have to rely solely on moderators to determine what content stays or goes. Users who are worried they will be missing out on bands we consider to be too popular only need to click the [top](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/top/) link. The original posts and discussions are still there. 

There are three exceptions we'd like you to make for this popularity rule...

* Brand new music by popular bands
* Exceptional live clips of popular bands
* New remixes or good covers of popular band's music

Feel free to discuss, we'll be watching.

You can also compare [our approval/vote ratio](http://i.imgur.com/GfqUY.png) to [several popular subreddits.](http://i.imgur.com/zJrUd.png) We're still ahead of the curve on [chantropy.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chantropy&amp;defid=3738897) Help us keep it that way."	t5_2qxzy	True

I'm looking to find out the average age of the people who subscribe to /r/listentothis, so i put together a short, 2-question survey using Google Docs. I'm not looking for karma, just two answers and 30 seconds of your time, so please upvote this for some visibility. I'm very interested in getting enough answers for a concise figure. Thank you. 

Edit: 400 responses in 4 hours. WOW. Thank you all so much for taking the time to take the survey.

Edit2: Almost 900 responses. I will be posting a larger survey tomorrow at 6am that has about 41 questions. Yes, It'll allow you to choose almost every major subgenre of every genre there is. 

Edit3: Over 1600 responses, thank you all. I have created a 52 question survey including all the genres you could want. You can find it on the front page or right **[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xCpPhMqgCR4pY0iFM66SEu3GDev-ubQa4coSP0-GekY/viewform)**"	t5_2qxzy	True

* **Post a reply to this thread that is a [genre]** you are interested in seeing on the charts. Vote these [genre] replies up so they float to the top of the thread. Please stick to *broad* genres for now, such as jazz, electronic, metal, hip-hop, rock, etc.
* **Post songs you think should be on the charts as replies to the [genre] threads.** So, for example, if you see a [hip-hop] genre thread, post all of your hip-hop recommendations under that, one video/music link per post.
* **Vote UP the video/music links under each genre thread if you want that track to chart.** Feel free to upvote as many of them as you like. Don't bother downvoting, we will be directly viewing up/down totals and counting *only the upvotes* on the posts to determine their placement on the charts.

If you haven't listened to a track, don't vote on it. Avoid upvoting particular artists just because you love them and want them to have more exposure - let each track stand or fall on its own merits, regardless of the genre or how old the track is.

There are no restrictions to what you can submit for consideration on the charts - not even the usual restrictions against popular bands. Don't let the popularity of a track in listentothis or other music reddits influence your pick - these charts are for people who don't care to spend all day slogging through the tsunami of music flowing through reddit.

There are no restrictions on [genre] - you can just as easily start a thread for [wtf] or [bestof2010] or [christmas] as anything else. The genres that are the most upvoted and have a large overall response will be the ones that make the chart.

**WTF is this doing here clogging up my audiostream?**

There's been some chatter lately about putting together a tl;dr-style best of the month music chart in the vein of billboard top40 (with less suck of course), powered by all of the music subreddits. It's going to happen sooner or later so we're pulling the trigger on it in listentothis today. 

We will likely go with something like 10 per popular genre, but that really depends on how this thread plays out, how many submissions we net, and how many people choose to participate. We're also linking this thread in the sidebar so it won't get lost. Voting will be open for at least a week, perhaps longer. Maybe we should leave it open for the entire month? You tell us.

We're thinking that if a given artist wins a spot on the chart on one month, they should be disqualified completely for the next month (or some period of time) so we end up with a high artist turnover on the charts. This isn't about trending what's popular, it's about exposing people to new music. 

If this goes well we'll probably be doing this once a month starting during the first week of each month. After voting closes, we'll put together a single post with all of the chart-toppers (and probably grooveshark playlists) then submitting it for everyone to enjoy.

---

**My picks are better than this feeble hipster hivemind.**

There will undoubtedly be people who think we are full of shit and that they can do a better job than the hivemind. Some of them are probably right. That's good news becase we have a job for them too. While we're compiling our community charts, work on your *own* lists. When we finally post the charts, post your top picks and alternative charts as *replies* to our community chart thread. We also encourage the other music subreddits and community moderators to create their own charts and/or moderator picks, and post them as replies to ours. We'll see how it goes and decide if we need to change the format/rules from there.

This is a work-in-progress, so if you have any ideas on how to improve this we want to hear them.

If you'd like to help choose it, or listen to the nominees, read on...	evilnight	170	26	205	"I'd like everyone to submit their picks for the best albums of 2012 so far, with a few caveats...

* This is 'best album', not 'best track' - the record has got to be solid all the way through, no filler.
* New artists are greatly preferred over older ones, particularly if it is a debut release.
* The album we select is going to be seen by most redditors, so let's use this opportunity to promote a band that can benefit from it, rather than promoting an established act.

Submit your picks along with a streaming link, and vote up the entries you feel are most deserving that best fit the criteria above. Feel free to upvote multiple entries. 

We are counting votes, however we are also considering well reasoned comments, so please feel free to go into full hipster-asshole mode with regard to others' musical taste like we do so often in /r/listentous and /r/letstalkmusic. 

Deadline for this is Thursday evening. Have fun! :)

---

TLDR: Find and submit streaming links to the best new albums of 2012 with a focus on new artists and less well known acts. Vote up the ones you think deserve it, flame the ones you don't. "	t5_2qxzy	True
