&gt;
&gt;TLDR; Act 6 Act 6 is next. This is Homestuck's final push. But before I start on it, I'll be taking a very significant hiatus to work on the [game](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game). 
&gt;
&gt;4/13/13 marked the 4th year of Homestuck, and a little more than the 5th year of MSPA's regular updates overall. Thanks to all those who've hung in there the whole time, as well as the very large number of you who piled on to this silly wagon at some point along the way. 
&gt;
&gt;The idea last year was to finish Homestuck and then begin working on the game. But as I've started to get into the early game dev process a bit, it's become obvious I have to start working on it much sooner. As in, right now. It takes many months of drawing and programming to make a game. But nobody can start on any of that until I've done a lot of writing and planning. So what it comes down to is, either I delay finishing Homestuck by a few months, or delay the release of the game by what would probably be a lot longer than that. Considering people threw 2.5 million bucks at me to make a game, I think that choice is obvious. 
&gt;
&gt;If I could do both at the same time, I would. But that's not realistic. Working on HS is an all consuming thing. Designing a whole game I believe will be too. It may sound obvious, but it can't be emphasized enough - entertainment takes a lot of time to create. More time than most people think. MSPA somewhat obscures that reality because I work on it as maniacally and efficiently as I can to keep the rate of output as high as possible. But the ease of production is an illusion. It is in fact a nonstop grind to generate this much material at a consistent rate. So I have to put all that on hold if I want to get anything else done. 
&gt;
&gt;I have noticed that some people believed HS would end on 4/13/13, though I never said that it would. Even if the story appeared to be on the precipice of resolution (which it wasn't), these rumors could be debunked for one simple reason. Animation takes A LOT of time. You've got to expect a story like this would end with some sort of big animation, right? I can't make those without suspending all updates completely for a good while. Trust me, the end to this won't sneak up on anyone. It will be really obvious when it's on the way. 
&gt;
&gt;To alleviate some of the suspense and wild speculation, I will give you a very loose estimate of my schedule, from now until the end of HS. Please observe these facts, as organized by this really awesome ""html table"" I have designed for this purpose.
&gt;
&gt;The thing I am going to be doing|How long that thing is going to take me
&gt;:---|---:
&gt;Work on the game, and probably some other stuff, like make more HS books. Oh, also go to a few conventions. No updates.|Months
&gt;Work on a whole bunch of regular updates for A6A6, leading up to the end of HS.|Months
&gt;Work on the final animation, plus zero or more other animations, just before or somewhat near the end of HS.|Months
&gt;
&gt;So that's it for now. See you in a while. Unless you decide to reread Homestuck or something. In which case I guess I'll keep seeing you here. Well not me, but my website will see you. My website is always watching. "	t5_2rzgi	True

1359436252.0	17haix	[IMPORTANT] Answering the age old question: Dave, is this you?	koobaxion	217	18	63	"So it seems that recently there's been an upturn in the amount of ~~shitposting~~ ~~low-effort karmagrabs~~ D4V3 1S TH1S YOU? posts and their ilk that have been showing up on the front page. Now, I'm not a big fan of those, but I try to keep my personal preference out of my moderating, so I leave them here because they technically don't violate any rules (Yes, they *are* technically MSPA related).

But even though they've been upvoted a lot, there's been ~~constant griping~~ some good discussion in the comments as to their contribution to the subreddit, as well as their relevance to anything. So, since this is *your* community, I thought I'd put it to a vote.

[So here, community, is the chance to have your voice heard.](http://obsurvey.com/S2.aspx?id=b8097700-d1d1-4cd9-b232-2a1b576610f1)

Answer now, as the polls will close in 72 hours. 

EDIT: Lots of input, you guys are awesome. However, **please remember to upvote this so that other people can have a chance to vote!** (self post... no karma, etc.)

**EDIT 2:** Uhh, we've hit a bit of a speed bump here. You guys turned out more than **680** responses which is far more than I imagined, which is awesome! But it turns out it's also not so awesome. I've used surveymonkey before for a few other surveys kind of like this, but I've never gotten more than 50 or so responses. It turns out that if you get more than 100 responses, Surveymonkey expects you to pay 25 bucks or so for a monthly gold license so you can view the rest of the responses. So I'm at an impasse here, as I don't have the disposable income to throw at this paywall. (Paying for a service? What sort of unsustainable bullshit business model is that?)

So here's the deal. I'm probably going to have to remake the poll on a different website in a little while because I don't think that 25 bucks is worth it even if we have like some fucking fundraiser bullshit or something.

*ANYWAY*, stay tuned and be prepared to have to vote again :(

**EDIT 3:** The survey has been remade using Obsurvey and not Surveymonkey. Use this link, or the edited above link to vote! Remember to vote again if you voted the first time!

But to reiterate: A picture of Faygo on a grocery store shelf, or a display of them in the cooler at a gas station, or a picture of one in your hand that you are about to drink is not immediately related to homestuck. 

And while I'm at it, the same thing goes for things Nic Cage related, or something that's blurry because of jpeg artifacts, someone sitting backwards in a chair... I could actually keep going but that would end up just a laundry list of things that I've seen and I don't want to pick on anyone specifically on accident.

Now there have been plenty of faces made this intermission. (We might even get a few more before the day is out.) Along with all those faces came a whole lot of emoticon requests, and every time I saw one I told you all I had a list, and that they were all going to be released the day the intermission ended. That day is almost definitely today, and I think we're all tired of waiting anyway.

So here they are. *All* of them.

And there you have it. Every face I've saved up from the intermission, plus a few people requested during that time. God *damn*, that was a lot of work.

Feel free to request any others, although I'm a bit busy today, so I might not get to them right away. 

Oh, and don't forget to upvote for visibility. The subreddit's gotten big enough now that posts don't instantly hit front page. [YOU ARE NOW AN ADULT SUBREDDIT. I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.](/pf413) 

Enjoy the emoticons!

**EDIT:** Oops, almost forgot to say this. I released them in one big EOA6I5 burst like this because it seemed like people were getting tired of the constant posts every single time I made a few emotes. The intermission was a bit longer than I anticipated, and eventually they piled up and made a huge post like this. I'm just wondering if you guys like the big bursts of emotes or if you'd rather I release them as they come out like I was doing before. Or maybe something in between, like a monthly emote post or something. Thoughts?

**EDIT II:** I will make rose smaller, and I will add these to the complete emote post.  
Both of these things will be done later."	t5_2rzgi	True

1365958786.0	1cbzcr	Okay guys, I am starting an official collective r/homestuck re-read.	afrokid251	181	13	106	"As suggested by /u/Boolderdash in another thread, I am making an official /r/homestuck collective re-read. 

This is to help us cope with the MEGAPAUSE as well as to have us all go back and see if we missed anything. With an epic as convoluted as Homestuck, it never hurts to go back and look over things again to make sure you understand everything. Plus it'll be fun, so let's go for it.

I am going to give us a new page to read to and make a discussion thread for the previous assignment every Saturday, and we will all get through this thing together. It'll be like our own little book club.

**Okay, first assignment is to read up to [THIS PAGE](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002114) (page 2114 according to the URL) by next Saturday (April 20th).**

That's just a bit over 200 pages, which I think is reasonable for one week. Tell me if you think I'm going too fast or slow, and I might change the length of the assignment a bit next week based on your thoughts.

**EDIT:** I should probably say that I'm going slowly on purpose, since we have all the time in the world and we want to make this last us a while. Going slower also means that those of us who don't have time to commit themselves to a full-speed reread can still easily keep up with us.

**EDIT II:** It seems like a few people also want to read Problem Sleuth and other older works from Hussie, so I'll make sure to assign side readings of other adventures starting next week.

Now everyone go read, and be back here next Saturday to discuss."	t5_2rzgi	True

Most recently, his house has burned down, destroying his musical equipment and all of his work, leaving him homeless and uninsured. 

You can donate through paypal at http://buzinkai.net/. This isn't a fundraiser, but just a post to help George out, and make him able to create more homestuck music again.

1349554693.0	1120ur	MSPAssistant: a new way to read Homestuck that needs your help!	banjaloupe	160	20	36	"Hello fellow Homestucks!

Over the past month or so my friend /u/video_game and I have been working on a large Homestuck-related project that might be of interest to you, called **MSPAssistant**. Here's the ""official"" description:

""MSPAssistant is a userscript that helps new and longtime readers navigate the tangled plotlines, references, and callbacks of Homestuck. Using an unobtrusive floating menubar, MSPAssistant allows for quick keyboard navigation through tagged pages of the story.
What do we mean by tags? Each page is marked with characters, objects, and recurring gags, and MSPAssistant allows you to easily ""track"" these tags, visiting pages only where those tags appear. This lets you read Homestuck in entirely new ways-- you can quickly check the last time you saw an important item, read pages containing only your favorite character, or skip forward to pages only where something is dead (seriously).""

**[Screenshot of how it looks on MSPA](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/mspashot.png)**

Current features:

* Keyboard navigation

    * Arrow keys: forward/back
    * P: expand/collapse pesterlog
    * Shift+Arrow keys: skip to beginning/end (first/last page with the tag)
    * Alt-C/Opt-C: Override page style to simple white/grey theme ([example](http://i.imgur.com/WEuhn.png), [compare](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/scratch.php?s=6&amp;p=005905))

* Appearance customization options

    * Bar on top or bottom
    * Show page number in title
    * Keyboard shortcuts enabled/disabled
    * Shadow enabled/disabled
    * Check for updates

* Tag tracking

* Tag selection (dropdown menu and selection page)

* Arrow key navigation automatically disabled on walkaround pages

* AND/OR tag mode


Sounds cool, hunh? Right now we have Acts 1 and 2 tagged, and if you [install the userscript yourself](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/) you can play around with it and see for yourself. Our hope is that you, seeing what we've done by ourselves so far, want to help us make it even better! Basically, this just involves rereading parts of Homestuck (as if you weren't gonna do this already) and writing down what characters appear, where they are, what they're wearing, any visual callbacks, etc, on a Google Docs spreadsheet (you can get more details by going to r/MSPAssistant).

With enough of us working together, we can create something really great and helpful for everyone, especially for new readers (as this allows them to skip back quickly and help them keep track of the story) as well as veterans (who might want to do focused archive-diving or story analyses). If this sounds interesting to you, or you have some free time, check out the [MSPAssistant page](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/) or the shiny new /r/MSPAssistant subreddit to talk with us and learn more. We are very serious about getting Homestuck tagged and we hope we've piqued your interest in doing the same!

--/u/banjaloupe &amp; /u/video_game

TL;DR: We made a cool thing that lets you read Homestuck in a new way, but we need your help to finish it! **[Check it out](http://mspassistant.vdoga.me/)**!"	t5_2rzgi	True

1366324996.0	1cn0eo	Dear Homestucks	gburnaman	151	18	71	"I'd like to take time to remind you that we're not Mormons. I recently ran across a certain someone in a certain subreddit (you know who you are) preaching Homestuck without proper context. The proper context of Homestuck is webcomics and similar media, rather than random Youtube based subreddits. The users basic post: 

""So x and y kind of blend together in my head, which makes sense because *I'm reading Homestuck!* (user goes on to explain what Homestuck is for no real reason)

I love you all and I can't say I've never preached Hussie to people (my sister and my neighbor, but only because they were both adamant Doctor Who nerds anyway). In fact, I'd go so far as to say we've probably all done it at least once before. However, coming up to someone out of context and mentioning Homestuck and then explaining it in parenthesis is a bit like those fucks that post LE REDDIT all over Youtube.

You want to *stab* them when they do that.

Just want to reiterate: talking to people about Homestuck isn't wrong. It's when you come around and just go HEY GUYS HOMESTUCK for no real reason that the fandom looks a little funky. 

And to the DREADED OFFENDER: you really didn't come across as that obnoxious, just took it a little out of context is all! It's kind of like going ""So yeah thank God I didn't have that last glass of wine or I might have been stuck at the party for the whole nigh! Also if you didn't know, God is that guy from the Bible who created the universe. Pretty awesome guy. Look him up!""

Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your thoughtfulness. Thank you and have a safe and productive day!
