1359594677.0	17lkoq	The long and boring VCO and DCO explanation	exphil	53	5	36	"Hi, I've been lurking here for a long time and thought I could make a contribution. :)

There's a lot of mention of VCOs and DCOs, analog and digital oscillators, and so on when discussing synths, both here on r/synthesizers and elsewhere as well. But it's rarely discussed in detail what those terms really mean or what the differences are (except in how they might sound). As an electronics and computer geek, these different oscillator designs interested me when I started looking into synths myself, and I started to read up on them. As I went on, I felt that I got quite a few misconceptions cleared up, and when I read various forum threads I got the impression that there were some common misconceptions others had as well about how VCOs and DCOs work, the whole analog vs digital thing, and so on. While there are some excellent online resources on synthesis theory (such as the great Sound on Sound series), it appears to be few dealing with this particular subject. 

Anyways, I like to explain stuff, both as a way for myself to straighten out my thoughts, and also to share what I've found with others, so I decided to write a short ""guide"" (which became a bit longer than I planned). I have tried to make this as basic as possible, but I also feel that going a bit into the details is important. I am not an electronics engineer or anything like that, so I can't guarantee that the details are 100% correct, and maybe I'll leave out stuff that is important. English also isn't my native language so there's probably quite a few spelling errors or grammatical errors. In any case, please leave a comment if you find something that's wrong!


**A quick recap of what an audio signal is**

An audio signal is basically a voltage that varies with time. When run through an amplifier and through a speaker, this signal dictates how the speaker cone moves. A positive voltage will move the speaker cone out, and a negative voltage will pull it in. How far out and how far in is determined by how large the voltage is. The speaker cone's movement sets the air molecules in a motion that mimics the motion of the speaker cone. The molecules will push on neighboring molecules, and what we get is basically what we call a sound wave. 

As most probably know, sort of a reverse thing happens in our ears. The incoming air molecules push and pull on our ear drums and this somehow gets converted back to electrical signals that our brain interprets. The most basic property of the sound wave that is perceived by the brain is loudness. The bigger the voltage is in the audio signal, the further the speaker cone gets pushed out or pulled in, and the further our ear drums get pushed and pulled. Our brain perceives this as the sound being louder. How far out the audio signal swings is called the signal's *amplitude*. In a typical synth, this is what we control with the amplifier section (the VCA or attenuator in many analogs). 

As we also know, our brain perceives some sounds as having a *pitch* and a *timbre*. These are a bit more complex, as they are not properties that every kind of sound has (as opposed to volume). 

A pitch is what the brain perceives when the sound has a repetitious pattern. If there is no recognizable pattern repeating (or not repeating often enough), we basically hear what we call noise. If there *is* such a repeating pattern, what determines the pitch is *how often* the repetition happens. We usually talk about this as *frequency*. The frequency is given in the unit Hz (hertz) and just means ""times per second"". A frequency of 5 Hz means ""5 times per second"", and conversely, an audio signal that repeats 20 times a second has a frequency of 20 Hz. 

The timbre is determined by how the signal 'acts' during each repetition. For instance, does the voltage begin at the highest and then constantly drop until it gets to the lowest? What we get then is a so called saw wave which most probably know. We'll see why that is when we make a graph of the voltage against time. Exactly how the timbre is perceived and how it relates to this varying of the signal voltage is perhaps the thing that is hardest to understand (and I don't feel I really understand it that well myself). It is all based on what we call the *harmonic content* of the sound. Understanding this thoroughly requires an understanding of a mathematical concept called *Fourier series*, but the main idea is that *all* repeating signals can be thought of as a sum of sine waves at various frequencies (called harmonics). Which harmonics are present and how they are weighted is what determines both the wave's shape, and actually how we perceive the sound (this probably sounds very fuzzy and strange, so if you need a better explanation, please read [here](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may99/articles/synthsec.htm)).


**The oscillator**

As most probably know, subtractive synthesizers are based around two main components: The oscillator and the filter. The oscillator produces the audio signal (usually one of the wave shapes above), or if we think about it another way, a set of harmonics. This then gets sent through one or several filters, where the signal is altered by removing harmonics from the signal. When we bypass the filter(s) completly (usually by turning low pass cutoff all the way up, or high pass cutoff all the way down), we get the raw signal from the oscillator. 

As mentioned above, there are three main aspects to the sound: volume, pitch and timbre. The volume is rarely, if ever, controlled by the oscillator (it is usually done by the amplifier / attenuator), so we can drop that. That leaves the pitch and timbre. The pitch is the only thing that is completely controlled by the oscillator. The timbre results from what wave shape the oscillator produces (remember that the wave shape is a result of the harmonics present), and the filter that it's run through (the filter removes harmonics).

An oscillator, in the synthesizer sense, consists of two main parts: The actual oscillator circuit  and a wave shaper. The oscillator receives information about what pitch to create, and produces the initial audio signal with the desired pitch. This signal can be something like a pulse wave or a saw wave. The job of the wave shaping circuit is to take in the initial signal and derive other kinds of wave forms, such as pulse, square and triangle waves *from* this initial wave form.

Now we are ready to start looking at VCOs and DCOs and how they work, but first we must agree on some terminology. When discussing VCOs vs DCOs, it is important that we all mean the same thing. I've seen many discussions where two people quite clearly talk about different kinds of oscillators and both calling them DCOs. There isn't *one* kind of DCO or one kind of VCO - oscillators are implemented in electrical circuits in many different ways - but we can make three main distinctions between different kinds of oscillators. I have decided to give them the following names:

* **VCO** (voltage controlled oscillator)
* **DCO** (digitally controlled oscillator): Oscillators that are digitally controlled, but have analog wave shaping
* **DDS** (direct digital synthesizer): Oscillators that are both digitally controlled and produce wave shapes digitally

(A DDS is also digitally controlled, but it will **not** be a DCO by the definitions I have given here. The term 'DCO' isn't really that good (and it is often a point of confusion), because it says nothing about analog wave shape. But I have chosen to use it nonetheless, mostly because that's what it has historically been called, and it is the name that has been used on most DCO synths.)

Synths which use VCOs or DCOs are called analog, as long as the rest of the circuitry, such as the filter, is analog. Synths that use DDSs but otherwise have analog circuitry are often called ""hybrid synths"" or ""analog/digital synths"". If we employ these three definitions, we can classify some of the popular vintage synths as follows:

* **VCO**: Nearly all 70s synths and high-end 80s synths (Moogs, ARPs, Prophet 5, Oberheims, ...)
* **DCO**: Roland's Juno and JX series, Korg Poly-61 and Poly-800, Elka Synthex, Oberheim Matrix series
* **DDS**: All samplers such as the Ensoniq ESQ-1 or SQ-80, Korg DSS-1, DW-series, PPG Wave

**EDIT**: An explanation of each of these three follows in the comments.

Even the shittiest VAs these days are excellent, and synth programming is even more of a lost art than it has always been, which is tragic.

So I pull up next to him and we proceed to have the geekiest broment I have ever had on the highway. We were like best friends for that brief moment.

1368068107.0	1dz7qn	What do you love about hardware synths?	HPHatecraft	23	3	42	"Over the last 4 years I've invested a lot of my disposable income on acquiring hardware synthesizers.  Having played on softsynths for a long time, playing several hardware synths over the last few years has given me a great appreciation for what a wonderful instrument each individual synth can be.  

Each synth has its own quirks and personality, and I really love the process of exploring and bonding with each one I own.  In fact, what I find most interesting is how a particular synth's limitations can inspire so much creativity while at the same time it forces you to acquiesce to it's hard-wired personality.  Each synth I own is my friend... Except for my Korg R3, fuck him.  

I don't know why I make these posts.  I assume that many of you synth junkies feel the same way.  I just find it interesting how unique I feel this quality is to synths.  Other instruments, like a guitar, may have it's own sound, but that sound doesn't vary much without external gear.  A poor analogy would be something along the lines of a guitar being like a color, but a synth is like a palette of colors.  A synth doesn't have access to every color, but rather a limited set of complimentary colors and tones.  

Sorry for rambling, but I just finished playing a few different synths over the last few hours, and each one gave me a different experience.  Fun. "	t5_2rdyc	True

My five cents:
I think the OP-1 is exceptional. It's like a Monomachine, except it's more user friendly. Simple interface and easy to make music with. It really fosters creativity.

Here's a track I made today - I've had mine for about two days now.

I was troubleshooting my Nord Lead 2 when I stumbled across this weird little easter egg which will give your Nord a bunch of sounds based on physical modelling synthesis. You can't save in this mode, but can send sysex, apparently.

To access it, do this (copied from Nord User Forum);

First you have to enter Pelle’s year of birth: 1965. Set Slot A to Program 19 and Slot B to Program 65. Only the numbers will do, so never mind if memory location 19 is holding another Program than the factory preset. Than press and hold the Portamento Auto button, after which you press and hold the Shift button (what else). Holding both press the Velocity/Morph button and release it again. Still holding the two first knobs press the Performance button and you will hear a click, which means the Pelle mode is active.

Only on the NordLead(1) and the Nordlead2; NOT on the NordLead2X, NordLead3 and NordLead4. It is an non-documentated mode which produces Physical Modeling and is only developed in an experimental state. It can't be saved, although it can be send using SysEx. It is a part of the Manual mode."	t5_2rdyc	True

Do you spend more time fiddling until you hear something beautiful, or do you start with a sound in mind and use what you know to get close? Something in between? Something completely different?

This is something I often think about with regards to songwriting, but it only just now occurred to me to apply it to sound design as well.

MS-20 Mini. I just wanted to see if there was any interest in possibly purchasing either a kit version or an assembled version. The board will be created using Eagle and sent off to a professional board-house. I plan on using both through-hole and surface mount parts. 
Below is a list of features I intend on using and a few things I haven't decided yet. Please feel free to throw in suggestions:

Clocking will be controlled in a few ways: 
External clock
External gates or triggers
Internal clock
External MIDI sync


A microcontroller will control 3 channels with 8 steps. These channels can be shortened to less then 8 steps, linked up for one 16 step and one 8 step, or linked for 24 steps. Each set of 8 steps can be stepped at the same time, or at their own speeds in relation to the clock (clock*2, clock/2,  ect.). 

Each step will include a switch to turn off the gate at the step, an LED to indicate the step location, a coarse tuning knob, and a fine tuning knob(not sure if I should include it). There will also be a switch to choose whether or not portamento will be on for that step (thing 303 slide). Each of the 8 steps will output it's own CV and gate/trigger. Each step's CV will also be converted to digital, converted to MIDI, and sent out the MIDI along with the MIDI sync. Each of the channels will output on it's own MIDI channel.

Controls for each channel include timing, pattern (looping, reverse looping, up/down, down/up, random), portamento, duty cycle, and a switch to choose between 0-5V, +/-1, and +/-5.

General controls will include a speed knob (disabled when receiving external clock or MIDI sync) and a shuffle knob.

I realize that this is a bit premature, since not many people have had a chance to use the MS-20 (unless they were just at NAMM), but not many people have been able to get their hands on the Minibrute either, and I probably won't have a chance to try either before buying. 

That said, anyone care to chime in about which one they would prefer, and why? I'm having a hard time not pulling the trigger on the Minibrute, but it might be worth waiting until the MS-20 mini drops.

[This is a follow up from an old post](http://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/1ddowk/oberheim_matrix6_and_matrix_2001_v251_patch/)

&gt; So I've been using this program called Matrix 2001 v2.51 a program that works wonderfully, but costs $20 for a full version. However, seems like the creator of this program ""Mark Strijbos"" disappeared. I have no way to give this guy money so I can use the full potential of the program.
His websites are down. [1](http://home.hccnet.nl/mark.strijbos/syn/m2001/buy.html) [2](http://www.mk2software.com/)

So I managed to turn this into freeware for all awesome Obie M6 users. This is a great patch editor and you guys definitely should grab this if you have the keyboard. I have instructions and pictures all set up for ya to get this thing working and ready to blast off.

To workaround the trial, I got this program called ""Runasdate"". It's basically one of the most duct-tape methods ever. But it works, always.

When I got it home I plugged it in immediately, and I feel like I have a completely different synth. It's amazing. The oscillators sound a lot smoother and fuller, where before I had issues with the tones I was getting out of the square and saw waves. The filter is way more responsive - I actually find the high pass and band pass usable now. I've never owned a hardware analog synth until 6 weeks ago so I thought the way my MiniBrute sounded was pretty cool but that sure it's a single oscillator monosynth and it's going to be limited.

1374166137.0	1ikhe0	I'm looking for the most versatile synth under $500.	Sabored	19	5	60	"I've had a Yamaha CS1x for about 8 years, and recently it just hasn't been cutting it for me. A few weeks ago I acquired an all analog [Casio MT70](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLJD4Vwh__M) and it just blew my mind. This little piece of shit (not to me!) keyboard sounds fuller than the Yamaha.


So I started looking up **old** synths that I could perhaps work my way up to ($200 from the yamaha, an extra $300 or so thrown in) and I'm having a lot of trouble finding something that I like just from watching youtube videos and reading shoddy and subjective reviews scattered around the net.

I'm not snobby about it being analog, I'm just looking for something that doesn't sound like shit.

**I also don't want something with 5 keys. 48 would be minimum, 70+ would be fantastic**. Poly only.

A few that have caught my interest are Roland's Juno 106, JX 10 and Yamaha's DX7 II (which I've always wanted because of the microsoft tone)

I know I haven't even scratched the surface, so recommend me some cheap synths!

**Edit: EVERYONE'S RECOMMENDING ME NEW MINIS!**

**Edit 2:**  I've learned from a few posts in this thread that the Rolands I have listed are not very versatile. Please disregard them as an example of what I'm looking for.

If you want a good example of what I'm looking for, consider the CS1x. Not the way it sounds itself, but the way it sounds compared to synths that are $300 more than it. I'm looking for something in that price range that is a real step up from the CS1x.

I *hate* the way the CS1x sounds, especially in the lower registers. It's the definition of a tinny synth in my book.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Edit 358374.5273: I believe I've narrowed down my choices to the Yamaha AN1x, the Yamaha DX7 II, the Alesis Ion, and the Korg MS2000.**

 **If you've owned any two of these synths, discuss which one you preferred.**"	t5_2rdyc	True

The advanced search is badass if I do say so myself.

At this point in my life, I don't have the passion or time to keep this up to date. I would love to hand this off to someone who is keen on updating it. There is a CMS set up for it which is easy to use, and if you have suggestions about code modifications and so on I'm OK with jumping in for that kind of thing. Right now there are few, if any, modular synths represented because they were difficult to classify into the database, but this is functionality I'm willing to build if a proper way to do it is determined.

ILoveScaldyMots	15	2	13	"I love this subreddit and my only complaint is that I wish there was more of it! After subscribing to /r/makinghiphop and other music subs I thought it would be good idea to add regular participation and discussion threads to add diversity to the content on here. These are some of my ideas:

* Daily ""Recreate this sound"" threads, i.e. a mod or someone chooses a famous or interesting synth sound from a track and people can hone there synthesis skills trying to replicate it. 

* Weekly Noob thread: it seems nothing works to stop newbies from making threads asking where to start off, but if there was always one thread dedicated to recommending entry level gear right on the front page then people might see that before making a post.

* Bi-Weekly Collaboration/feedback thread: There's a lot of excellent musicians on here and sometimes when people post tracks on their own they get buried. If there was a specific thread for original music, people might more easily get feedback or help.

* Monthly Gear trading/selling thread. Pretty much speaks for itself.

Other subs seem to have these kind of threads posted by a bot. I have no idea how that might be set up but if even they weren't posted every day/week like clockwork it could still work.
     I may be too optimistic to think daily or weekly threads would be worth it but anyway, let me know what you guys think.

I had never really touched an analogue synthesiser before, so naturally I turned it on and went at it. It took me all of 2 minutes to figure out all of the parameters and start making awesome sounds. At one point, I even made that cool descending sound from Frankenstein! When I looked up, I saw people looking on, appearing quite impressed.

I'm a big fan of hardware synths, and in a perfect world, I'd have a warehouse full of them. 

Nonetheless, I've come to a point where it would be wise for me to pick two or three softsynths, learn them inside and out, and become expert at using them -- with the intention of using them as  my ""go-to"" synths (for those times when using hardware synths is impractical)(and, let's face it, I expect them to become my go-to polyphonic synths in any case).

I'm considering these. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions:

* [u-he Diva](http://www.u-he.com/cms/diva)
* [GForce ImpOSCar2](http://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/imposcar2)
* [Spectrasonics Omnisphere](http://www.spectrasonics.net/products/omnisphere.php)

I should note that I'm not so much worried about how much money these softsynths cost.  My main concern is whether or not the commitment (time, energy) to master them would pay off over the long run.

*(FWIW, I primarily use Logic.  The softsynths included in Logic are indeed powerful, but their user interfaces drive me insane -- leaving aside the fact that their UI designs are eyeball-frying ugly).*

**tl;dr** If you were to pick two or three softsynths to use as your go-to synths, which would you choose?

*****
**EDIT:** should also include [Moog Animoog](http://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/animoog-0) in the list.  Animoog v2 has Audiobus support. It would appear that [Audiobus](http://audiob.us/) is going to revolutionize the App softsynth world.

After recently getting an Elektron Analog Four, I realized I'd like to try my hand at other genres (specifically electro/80s cheese/french touch, etc). 

Stuff like:

[The Outrunners - Diamonds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWM6rpl2UE#t=118s)

[Minitel Rose - Business Woman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XrNpBqoUq0#t=83s)

[Miami Nights 1984 - Early Summer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8FYYCI8MW8)


I can't wait for Elektron to implement poly (or even unison) mode and don't want to resort to hacks like using a MIDIPal to split MIDI commands.

In order to do this without a huge amount of hassle I need a nice polyphonic synth like a Roland Juno/Jupiter, Oberheim OB-XA, etc.

However, these synths are very very expensive!

I'm not sure if a VA synth will do what I need, not because I'm an analog snob (well, I kind of am), but because *the user interface on most of them seems terrible*. Reading [reviews of the Jupiter 80](http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug11/articles/roland-jupiter-80.htm) was confusing - parts? layers? registration? What the hell?

My wishlist:

* Polysynth - capability for lush pads is mandatory

* Fully analog or well-done VA synth engine

* Lots of knobs for direct control of parameters

* No touchscreens, layers of menus, computer-based editing of patches, or similar BS

* Patch memory would be nice

* Arpeggiator

* Basic sequencer (or programmable arpeggiator phrases)

* MIDI capable or possible to retrofit with a kit of firmware upgrade

How do I get all these features in one package without spending [~$8,000 on a Jupiter 8](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271155333729)?

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR:

* Are there any cheaper lesser-known analog synths that can achieve that classic 80s polysynth sound?

* Are there any budget VA synths that don't suck and have lots of knobs for direct control?

* If not, what's the best popular analog synth for my needs?

* An okay price to spend is around $2,000 or less, but I'm willing to go up a little bit if it gets me a killer deal. However $3,000 is the hard limit, for sure."	t5_2rdyc	True

I've dicked around with Massive for about a year and a half, and written a few tracks using Massive as my primary synth, but i wasn't getting quite what i wanted in terms of physical control. My Kontrol 49 does a decent job of controlling Massive, but with only 16 encoders, it wasn't quite cutting it for sound design or ""fun-ness"".

So i decided i should buy a hardware synth right before i even heard of the NAMM in January. 

A week and a half of heavy research later, i ordered a Sub Phatty on Feb 6.

It [arrived at work](http://i.imgur.com/tRPlY11.jpg) yesterday, after having been shipped on April 4.

This box was actually inside a larger box with some bubble wrap for shipping. It came through unscathed, not even the outside box was dented anywhere.

The Sub was in there [pretty snug](http://i.imgur.com/ZdYvI5c.jpg). The cardboard thing is basically a diagram of the front panel with some comments on the various sections that briefly describe each of the sections and parameters (parameters? knobs? Is there a specific term for these that i can't remember?).

Underneath the synth were a number of [other items](http://i.imgur.com/uAOKeoL.jpg). Registration card, power cord, a sticker, ""A Brief History of the Minimoog Voyager"" (the brown item on the bottom), a product catalog (green, middle), a printed manual (which is also available in .pdf and i believe has already superseded the printed version), and a Flying Lotus puzzle. I'm not a fan of puzzles, but it's a nice touch anyway, and i know someone who would like it.

Mine is number [408](http://i.imgur.com/dnh9cv9.jpg). I've seen #22 here on reddit a while back, and 56 (i think) somewhere on Gearslutz or something. I know some people care a lot about ""early editions"" or something; mostly I'm happy mine is likely to be on the good side of ""we're up to speed on how these things go together"".

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/k8qNQn9.jpg) a shot to catch the entire front panel. Basically nothing new to say here, other than ""Yeah, it looks exactly like the photos and in the videos"", so no last minute changes were put through on the panel.

As you can see, it's a reasonably compact piece of equipment. It's about 2/3rds the length of my Kontrol49. I'm gonna be moving equipment around a bit until i get an extension for my desk, i think; i'm gonna need to fit a Push in there someday.

I messed around with it a bit after work last night, and i  really like the sound of it. It sounds fuller than Massive to me.  I'm having problems conceptually sorting out how to assign the LFO to stuff like the filter and also i need to figure out the mod wheel. Massive's routing is pretty powerful and easy to follow. Sub Phatty's is really different.

I gotta say, i'm not actually that impressed with the Multidrive. It sounds good, but i was hoping for more *drive* than you actually get with it. I'm sort of tempted to run the thing through my ODB-3 bass distortion pedal to see what happens.

The knobs feel so great. They're smooth, and just sticky enough  to not move when you bump them, but also require very little effort to move and position. So much better than my Kontrol.

I can't show you what it sounds like yet because i haven't sat down to figure out how to connect it to Ableton yet. But *soon*.

More or less, where do you guys see this going now?  Sure, we can hope that Roland and Yamaha will take note, but I fear for the boutiques companies.

1365291896.0	1bto4u	Bass Synthesizers: Why do they exist?	CosmicEngender	16	5	28	"Now, please excuse my ignorance here. I am not trying to imply that Bass Synthesizers shouldn't exist, I'm simply trying to understand why they do.

Yeah, maybe not everyone can afford a fully-functional synth (though, they are not difficult or expensive to come by second-hand, at least when it comes to non-rare synths, which makes that explanation kind of dubious), and/or maybe they only have need for a bass instrument, having all other instruments already covered. But that leads me to my main question:

Does it really save a manufacturer money to make a synth that only produces tones in a few (4-5?) octaves versus the whole spectrum? How is it even possible for an oscillator to not produce the whole frequency range without being artificially limited? All an oscillator does is convert the direct current from the power supply into an alternating, or, *cough*, oscillating current signal. According to wikipedia, an audio oscillator by definition produces frequencies in the full audio range, from about 16 Hz to 20 kHz.

So, are these limitations artificial, designed to create price brackets by which manufacturers (artificially) increase the value of fully-functional flagship synthesizers by offering a 'budget' alternative in the form of a bass synth? (Think Minitaur versus Moog Voyager.) Truthfully, that's about the only thing I can come up with to explain their existence, since I see no reason why a Moog Voyager wouldn't be just as capable at producing bass tones as a Minitaur (therefore removing the need for some kind of dedicated bass synth), or why a Minitaur shouldn't be just as capable as the Voyager at producing tones from across the entire audible frequency spectrum.

I've never used a bass synth before, so if there is some obvious explanation that I am missing, that fact is probably apparent to you all by now. But, I would love to hear what you guys (and gals) have to say about all this. What do you think? Am I completely missing the point, here?

Nord Leads all sound pretty good, but they are fairly basic, and don't take great advantage of being digital when it comes to modulation.

Waldorf Blofields just scare me.  Wavetable stuff is just intimidating... and the interface is a knob matrix!  FUUUUUUUU!

Some of the kits from [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=HOME&amp;VPW=1024&amp;VPH=594) seem pretty cool.  I lack the technical ability to put one together myself, but [this guy](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Sound-Lab-Analog-Synthesizer-MFOS-with-AC-Adapter-NEW-/180992390487?pt=Keyboards_MIDI&amp;hash=item2a23fcb557) has some nice looking builds.

I love the harsh wavetable sounds of the PPG and Waldorf synths. And I think something rough and digital would be a great way to expand my mostly analog studio. Unfortunately I don't have the cash to pay for a Blofeld. So I thought this might be a good time to learn some DIY

The problem is the build aspect. I am no stranger to electronics, I built my own computer and have some in depth knowledge of how synthesizers work (at least analog ones) and are built. So I'm wondering if a DIY novice like me would have any chance in hell at not mucking up a $200+ kit. Soldering is what makes me nervous...

I have a little bit of experience building things, but this ended up being the biggest DIY project I've done. 

As of now it's functional, just some sanding, staining, and finishing touches left, and wiring up the final midi jacks.

Once it's fully completed it will be a 25 pound, wooden case wrapped in tolex, with stained wood side panels, capable of all basic midi operations (CC, after touch, patch change, octave change, modulation, pitch bend, and 6 assignable potentiometers). The only requirement is a single 7-pin midi cable that provides power to keyboard.

Just wondering if this is too good a deal to pass up, or if I should hold out for something else in the same price range. 

From videos I've watched, I like how it sounds (not love tho, but I feel with enough tweaking I can love it) and feel like I could get a lot out of it. It seems like a lot of menu diving, but the editor seems cool and I like how I can use the 4 voices independently. 

I was hoping for something with a keyboard, but I have a midi controller, and I think the Tetra would fill my polyphonic needs pretty well. 

Anyway, I'm considering getting it as my first step into the world of analog/hardware. It seems like a pretty good deal, and I figure if I really hate it I could always sell it for the same price I got it for.

Just wondering what your guy's thoughts are. I could really use some advice.

I want a small setup to doodle with musical ideas, whenever or wherever the inspiration strikes, but still able to contribute to a fully realized track, all while trying my damnedest to stay below $1000.

The main goal is that the setup be simple and straightforward enough that I loose nothing while attempting to translate my ideas into music when I need it(and not spend an hour setting up a single patch... already have stuff for that), but still be unique and varied enough that I can explore and experiment with sounds when I want to. Portability and a decently small footprint is important. It doesn't all have to be battery powered, but I want to be able to cram everything into one bag so I can run to a friend's house (or even, God forbid, show my face in public somewhere) to jam. I just want to be able to try a different approach and setting that's different than working in a studio.

So with all these goals, the TE OP-1 seems like the easiest solution. A single, battery-powered device loaded with multiple synth engines, sampling, a handful of effects, and a 4 track recorder... it almost sounds too good to be true, so of course I have a few fears. First and foremost, are the sounds varied and mutable enough? My biggest passion is sound design. When I have a good sound I like, that's what I usually build upon for a track. Will I feel like I've exhausted all the sonic possibilities in the course of a matter of months? Does everything coming out of the instrument end up sounding repetitious after awhile? There's a lot of stuff I could get instead for that kind of money, and I'd rather not spend it on a one-trick pony.

Many other setups are possible, and I want to figure out which can do the most, in terms of sound creation. I've considered the new MS-20 mini, along with a Monotribe (but that wouldn't have quite the immediacy I'm hoping for). I could get a little netbook, load it with Reaper and maybe some VSTs, get a few buildable syth kits (like a Mee Blip, the Mutable Instruments stuff, or any other small interesting boxes), and play with a small MIDI controller (or a Korg Nanokey for extra added smallness). 

Unfortunately, there's no way I can try out an OP-1, or most of the other things I've mentioned, before I buy. For that reason, I'm coming to you all, whose opinions I (generally ;p) respect. How would you approach building a unique sounding sonic sketchpad?"	t5_2rdyc	True

I did some mistakes, but worked my way through and learned a lot. Here is a short list of things I would have posted to myself a few weeks ago (there was actually a submission):

* Triplecheck everything. I confused some components and finding and fixing the problem is much harder once the components are soldered.
* Get yourself a oscilloscope and a regulated power supply. Without oscilloscope its impossible to debug the circuit. Regulate the current to 200 mA or whatever is the expected maximum current. It will save your components in case of a short circuit.
* Never give up, there is always a way out.
* Try to understand the circuit. Even if you don't understand the details, the big picture helps a lot for debugging.
* Troubleshooting: first check the power supply and related components. What voltage is on the output of the voltage regulators? Check the voltage on the ICs, download the datasheets and check if there is something weird on the power supplies or other pins. Check the signals with an osclloscope on components if you know the expected outcome.
* Though I didn't do it, get an experiment board to check components. There are simple circuits to check ICs and most other components.
* Desoldering an IC is nearly impossible though I managed to do it with help from a friend. If the IC is broken, cut off the pins and desolder the pins afterwards or solder the pins on the top side of the board.

I should mention, that the PAIA 9700 kit is very beginner-friendly and gives you a lot for the price. The filter has some problems, which can be fixed using attenuators. The sound is very analog and I prefer it to my soft synths. I plan to extend the kit with an additional oscillator, VCA, mixer, splitter, sample&amp;hold. I recommend this experience to anyone interested in analog synthesizers. "	t5_2rdyc	True

I've been considering getting an Elektron Machinedrum. I'm not sure if it's the right drum machine for me, though. I have an Analog Four and an Octatrack and I **love** the Elektron sequencer. My bandmate has a Monomachine. So, we're both pretty comfortable with the *Elektron way of doing things.*

We do something like electro. Sort of like Cybotron (even with the guitar! only run through a mooger fooger freqbox). Broken beat and groovy. The intent is a ""live"" band with this (hardware only, no computer). We only recorded to try to help with arranging. https://soundcloud.com/cykranosh/sets/electro-band

Examples of the bands we're looking up to are: [Blastromen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxm6Q19WKmM), [Boris Divider](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZTkJ_OhpM), [Cybotron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgcgkrcNHso), [Diplomat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQlwrv7lfF0), [Dopplereffekt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnZJihkgnk0). We're not quite doing this style, but, it's our jumping off point.

For the most part, I've been using the Octatrack as a drum machine, an effects box and my side's submixer. I'd like to start using it as the live sampler it's supposed to be. But, for that to happen, I need a drum machine to replace it.

The drum machines I'm considering are the Tempest and Machinedrum (either the UW model or the non-UW model).

**Tempest**: When this was announced, I knew I *needed* it. I started writing all my music with Ableton Analog instances for each drum ([example](https://soundcloud.com/cykranosh/traveler-at-dusk)) in preparation of getting one (this was before I made the switch back to hardware again). But, when it finally released and I watched a ton of videos, the workflow didn't seem to be what I was looking for. I love the sound, but, I don't know if I could make friends with the interface. That and it's twice the price of the Machinedrum non-UW model.

**Machinedrum (non-UW model)**: The sequencer would be like second nature at this point. I don't care that it's not analog. The FM and PI machines intrigue me the most. But, I've not seen a lot of videos with people using those (they are few and far between). It seems most people are using the TRX machines for the drums (and the EFM for kicks)? I know it can make amazing kicks and snares, I worried about all the *metallic* percussion. Hats? Crashes? When I'm synthesizing drums, I spend the most amount of time of the hats. I know no one can tell me if my subjective wants will be met, but, is the range of metallic and useful sounds pretty wide?

**Machinedrum (UW model)**: I have an Octatrack and am not sure the extra $500 is necessary? I rather like the idea that I can resample itself and build up ""layered drums"" that way. One of my problems with the Octatrack is that I like to make drums specific for songs, and using samples makes that kinda hard. I find it creativity killing to browse for samples, rather than manipulate what's already there. But, samples are kinda needed for what we're doing, so, it's either get this one, or, keep using some tracks on the Octatrack for drums.

I have an Electribe ER-1. I really like it the synth voices, but hate the samples. Only four voices really sucks, though. I also hate the NRPNs (I'm in the middle of making an arduino CC-&gt;NRPN for it, so I can p-lock the hell out of it with the Octatrack ... with code that probably works ... if I ever get around to finishing it).

I have a bunch of mid-late 80s drum machines (RX5, RX7, RZ1, R50e, HR16, DDD1, DR550), but, none are synth based. Nor would I want to take them out to play live. They are strictly studio pieces. And, I definitely have enough drum samples. So many, I feel vaguely uncomfortable shaking a stick at them. :D

I have all three Volcas on order, but, I don't think the Volca Beats is gonna be the drum machine I've been looking for, lol! I think they'll be fun jam boxes.

My bandmate just picked up a drumstation, so, we're good on 808/909 sounds (making my previous want for a Tanzbär a little redundant).

The Jomox boxes and the Miami are all a little too niche for me. I'm not overly concerned with x0x sounds.

I've been thinking about the Vermona DRM-1, but, there's no sequencing and it's ""all live"" (no patches). Same thing with the (very hard to find) [MAM ADX1](http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/mamadx1.php).

So far I've found both the Meeblip and the Shruthi-1 to be very interesting, because of their price and relatively low DIY-skill requirements. I've been looking around for other similar products, and though I've found many DIY modules, noise makers and other interesting devices, I have not been able to find any that are quite as complete as the meeblip and the shruthi. Do any others exist?

The hackability of the meeblip and the shruthi interests me, but it is not a must. I like knobby analog synths too (quite a lot in fact, but they tend to stray outside of my budget), so if there are similarly complete DIY synths that are analog instead of digital (the meeblip and shruthi are both ATMega-based, I think) that would make a viable candidate too.

HPHatecraft	10	1	24	"After years of inner-debate, I recently started investing in analog synthesizers.  It first started with a Minibrute.   I love it in spite of its quirks and limitations.  It just sounds good.   However, it left me wanting to feel/play an analog poly synth.  

I just got a Juno 106.  It is in fantastic shape, and it sounds pretty damn nice.  However, I find myself uninspired by its sound in most instances.  Perhaps it's just me, my tastes, and the style of music I attempt to create, but this very well-liked vintage synth just leaves me a little let down.  

I knew what it was when I bought it, and I have no regrets.  The whole experience just got me thinking about what sound qualities people are drawn to in a particular synth.  So many people love the Juno series, but it just doesn't excite me like it does for them. I'm sure some people dislike the Minibrute, while I really enjoy using it. 

Thoughts?  I'd love to hear what traits, characteristics, and even features that you enjoy. 

P.s.  this discussion is not intended to be purely about analog.  I'd prefer to have my Nord Lead 3 rack than this Juno in most instances even though it doesn't sound as juicy in most instances.

I'll be trying to get my grubby hands on some nice analog hardware for the first time, and I'm looking for some interesting suggestions as to what kind of synth I might want to be on the lookout for.

Any Suggestions?


1 - Not getting a Moog

2 - Not getting a TB-303 (they're just way too expensive)

3 - Not looking for a drum machine (yet)

Edit: Price Range is looking like somewhere between $500-$1000, and hoping to find something with the versatility to be used in a wide variety of fashions. I.E. Pads, Leads, Basses, SFX, etc.,  rather than a synth that does one thing really well. Polyphony would be nice, but I realize it makes analog equipment typically much more expensive, and so is not essential for me at this time."	t5_2rdyc	True

1352428701.0	12w5s1	Drum synthesizers?	Crickc5	12	3	41	"So, I've been looking at getting into drum synthesis and sequencing as a way to improve my music(alternative/IDM fusion, I think?), and I have no idea where to start. So now, I'm here, to ask for your advice. In my experience, people here know a thing or two about hardware.

I'm not interested in VSTs; I plan to play live, and I don't really own a laptop/want to carry one on stage. But, I tried looking at various drum synths/beatboxes and nothing really looked interesting. I did, however, look at the Korg Electribe SX-1 and the Nord Drum. I like the electribe for the sequencer and all of those extra features, but the drum synthesis sounds pretty limited, if nonexistent. I like the Nord Drum because of its pure barebones analog modeled synth engine. I'm also into DIY synth stuff and could build some sequencers to trigger the drums, so the sequencer isn't a necessity, but quite convenient.

Sorry if that was a bit of a rant, I tend to ramble. Anyway, I also don't want to spend $1000+ on a drum machine(no tr-808).

Oh, also, for reference, I'm trying drum synthesis to get those kind of abstract, indescribable percussive sounds Aphex Twin uses a lot. I don't really know much of the theory behind it, so I don't even know if that's possible. I know RDJ tampers with his stuff a lot.

I've been doing a bit of production for the last couple of years. I've had a lot of fun cutting up samples and messing with synth presets and effects but would really like to take the next step in terms of my synthesis skill (of which i have very little).

I've made a few cool bass sounds in Massive, I use FM8 and Absynth too (Student discounts got me Live 8 and Komplete 7 for ridiculously cheap) but don't fully understand how they work..

I've always wanted a good hard synth, but am unsure as to whether I should just stick with what I have. I feel like it might be a better way to learn more about synthesis. 

Interested to know your opinions. Do you guys think it would it be a good investment? If so, what would you go for?

edit: All your comments have been massively helpful. Thanks! I'm going to say here what I said in reply to someone in the EDMP thread: A lot of the posts here have made me realise that regardless of practical applications, I actually just really want one. I think that essentially is what it boils down to. I can try to justify spending more than a thousand dollars on a synthesizer because maybe it'll make my tunes better, but I think the old workman vs. tools argument applies here. Boys and toys etc etc. So I'm going to be a spoiled brat and get a good control surface for my VSTs AND a synthesizer. Cos.. you know.. fuck indecision.

I'm in a position where a couple of months of saving will get me there. Surely having a bit of both worlds can't be a bad thing. And if it turns out in a couple of years I suck at synthesis, I'll sell the fuckin thing on eBay and buy a train set. Choo choo!"	t5_2rdyc	True

What is the best way to do this in realtime, i.e. without having to record audio and then try to covert that to midi? It seems to me like it would be really intuitive, especially if one can sing well, or for producing special effects.

Edit: wow, many good replies, thank you everyone, you are wonderful. Let me explain the inspiration for this: I realized that whenever I try to explain to someone what should come next in a song I would hum the melody, imitate the rhythm of the percussive parts, or attempt to emulate with my voice a special effect. So I thought wouldn't it be great if I could use these admittedly sometimes poor imitations I make with my voice as instructions for my synths? So for example when I say swoooosh, the vst would also try its best at making a swoooosh using its own sound generators and following the envelope of my voice. I see many applications for live performance and for the studio. Of course there's something to be said about learning your synths such that you can dial in the sounds manually, but that wouldn't be as immediate or fun, and would kill the potential for live improvisation.

I would want the knobs that come with the Prophet 08 Keyboard, the ones that are straight cylinders with the little silver strip around the top of them, but it isn't clear on the DSI store page which knobs come in their ""Knob Kits"" due to the generic stock photo they used for each kit. 

Does anybody know if new Prophet racks are being made with the same knob as the keyboard version? It doesn't really matter as I'm looking to buy used anyway, but I'm just curious. I guess I'd be looking at having to change all the knobs if I bought the rack version?

 So I've been interested in getting a semi-modular and saved up enough to order the Doepfer Dark Energy II. Of course, now the MS-20 Mini has been announced and it's right in the same price range (a little lower, actually). There have been a lot of posts about it and I don't think anyone has compared it to the Dark Energy for some reason. What do you think the pros/cons are to each of these synths? I'd also love to know how they could interact with each other. For instance, could the mod wheel on the Ms-20 Mini be used to control the VCO PW on the Dark Energy? It seems to me like they should, but like I said, I don't know anything about semi-mods or how they interact with each other. I'm hoping to learn on one of these.

 Thanks in advance! It doesn't seem like there have been any other affordable semi-modulars around to compete with the Dark Energy, so this might be worth talking about.

In general, I'm interested in expanding my own solo synth skills. Currently if I feel like creating some music I set some synths to arp, some to key holds with interesting LFOs, then a lead. This leads to some cool stuff but I end up limited to the one chord.

[Take a listen to Giorgio by Morodor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmpsBeaVrkE). So there's a nice little arpeggio that cycles through a sequence of a bunch of chords, but retains the same order of notes.

So my question is, lets say I want to create this live but I want to ""phrase record"" it to loop after I've done it once (in MIDI, not audio). Am I actually looking for an arp or a sequencer?

Is there a function or a device that would let me input a sequence and turn it into an arpeggio that I could play with any combination of notes? Like say I input 1-2-1-3-1-4, and hold down C-E-G-C, it would play C-E-C-G-C-C?

This may be in my arsenal somewhere already.. I have in my collection: Fantom G6, JP8080, MicroKorg, Gaia, MG-1, Korg N5, Korg M1, Korg Electribe EMX-1.

I know that the Fantom has _some_ sort of ability to import a MIDI file as an arp but every example I've seen of it on youtube seems to indicate that it has no dynamic nature to it except it will shift pitches depending on the single note you start it on.

Thanks!

Quick edit: For a workflow example, I'd like to first make my own custom arpeggio mode, then I'd like to be able to start recording loop (in MIDI, for example how the Roland Gaia has a phrase recorder) and run through my sequence of 4 or 8 bars once. Then I hit loop and it works on its own from then on and I can move on to my other synths.

What I _don't_ want to do is simply input the entire sequence beforehand. 

Last edit: Looks like what I want doesn't exist, but I don't think it'd be hard to make, so I'm going to make it. I'll post a pic/video when it's done in probably a month."	t5_2rdyc	True

I went down to my local Guitar Center and had an absolute blast playing the MiniBrute. I loved how dirty it could sound, to the point where I would be using the synth for melodies as well as some harsh, glitchy rhythmic elements. Unfortunately they didn't have the MS-20 on display to try out, and this would ultimately have been the best way to decide. However I don't know how I would get a chance to play the MS-20 other than messing with the MS-20 VST, which really wouldn't affect my decision too much.

For anyone with MS-20 experience, how 'playable' is it? That is to to say, does it seem like a chore to crank out sounds or is it a 'fun' (whatever that means), intuitive synth? For any of y'all that have used both, what are your thoughts between the two?

1366421813.0	1cprhg	Polyphony: Is 4 voices really enough?	CosmicEngender	8	0	35	"So, having sold off some possessions and coming into a decent-size tax return check, I'm finally approaching being ready to pull the trigger on a major synth, and the one currently in my crosshairs after months of research is the DSI PolyEvolver PE Keyboard. 

At this point, I'm less interested in suggestions for which gear to buy (though not entirely disinterested), and more interested in what people think about limited polyphony, because I love almost everything about the DSI PEK-PE: It's 4-osc per voice, it's nearly knob per function, it has both analog and digital/wavetable synthesis, and personally I think it sounds great. But it only has 4 voices.

I've owned monosynths before, and although many people are comfortable using them to simply record layer upon layer to create polyphonic sounds, I've never been able to get into that workflow because of how I write music in a very polyphonic, piano-player mindset. The thing is, as far as polysynths go, I've never owned anything with less than 8 voices before, which is as low as I'm certain that I'll be comfortable with. 

I know the obvious advice is to play a PolyEvolver in person to see how I feel about the polyphony, but where I live, there is nowhere for me to do that. A music shop near me got one of the original rotary encoder PolyEvolver's in used a few years ago, but when I went back to try it out a week or so later, it was already sold.

So, I'm turning to the good folks of /r/synthesizers for your opinions on polyphony. As someone who very often plays with 5 notes or more at once, am I going to be frustrated and let-down by being limited to 4-note polyphony? I own a JP-8000 and Waldorf Q rack which are 8- and 16-voices poly respectively, but I'm looking for something with more bite in the sound and a bigger keyboard than the JP and more onboard controls than the Q rack. I've only got 10 fingers, so I don't expect much more than that from any instrument, but I like knowing I can drop all 10 of them on the keyboard and have the Q make sound for every note. 

I guess that pretty much sums it up. Thanks a bunch to anyone who wants to share their thoughts on this matter. :)"	t5_2rdyc	True

After opening it up, seeing no visible damage and messing around with some of the trim pots in vain hope it would return I am willing to throw in the towel. 

I live in the middle of nowhere, finding a tech nearby is impossible. I suspect shipping it somewhere for a repair and shipping it back will be expensive. I don't know if my wallet's up for it. Also, I'm 99% certain that I'm getting the MS-20 Mini and I'm sure that will appease my analog monophonic jones. 

So--I'm thinking of parting with the ARP in hopes it can find a home better equipped to take care of it. 

•Is this a bad decision? Will it be collectable enough someday I should hold onto it? Or liquidate it for the Korg?

•If I'm wrong and a repair is a realistic option, how do i go about it? Where do I send it? Who do I contact?

•What is a functioning ARP Solus (minus 2nd oscillator) worth? How do I determine this?

•If I choose to sell it, who do I dangle it in front of? I'd rather not use eBay. Do we have some sort of protocol regarding classifieds here?

For Akai, I've found the X-7000 to really take my inspiration to new heights. The easy sampling + resampling and the nice filter makes for a great pad-machine and also to make those Boards of Canada sounds.

I made a tune using only these three machines and some song to try and demonstrate these points! :)

I have zero experience with modular, but I understand and am familiar with ""modern"" synths. I've had an Alesis ION, DSI Prophet 8, Tempest and I've got a Prophet 12 on the way. However, I want to try modular and patching. It seems like a good way to further my knowledge and understanding of synthesis, while also giving a fun and unique way to craft new sounds. So, that being said, I have no idea what I should start with. 

Cost isn't a huge issue, I just want something that's going to be flexible and offer me a lot of room to grow and expand. So far I've mostly been looking at Analogue Solutions, but I'm not sure what would suit me best. Something like the Vostok looks like a good choice for an ""all in one"" type of deal, and I like the Oberkorn for sequencing, but would I be limited in getting something like that? Also, would it be worth it to get an oberkorn to go along with the vostok? I assume the sequencer in the vostok is a lot more limited.

I'm looking for a few questions to be answered:

- Will the Darktime be able to affect things like cutoff, lfo, wave, pitch etc via the VX-352?

[/Edit]

Hi there,

I just got my new MS-20 mini today and I love it.

However I'm experiencing something strange and I'm not sure if it's a fault, or something normal.

When I turn down the level of both osc1 and osc2 in the VCO mixer section, I am hearing a large amount of white noise triggered when I play the keys. I can even shape it with the Envelope Generator 2 section so I think it might be coming from the VCA - something perhaps confirmed by a comment by the other guy on this subreddit who got his in the last few days.... Is this normal? I did not expect it would be so noisy. It literally sounds like there is a noise source on at all times triggered when I hit a key.

Does anyone have an original MS-20 to do a comparisson?

Thanks.

It's digital underneath but with lots of patching points and controls on the top.

I've done something like this [before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9KnqQgPu_E) and now I'm working on a more ""finished"" version.

Today I've been working on a front panel mockup to get an idea of how many resources I will need, size of case, general layout, number of pots, etc.

[Front panel mockup v1](http://i.imgur.com/ZdYN5QM.png) - 

[Front panel mockup v1.1](http://i.imgur.com/AdzO6bK.png) - fixed the CVs for the pad, deleted 1 MIDI CV. MIDI CVs can also be internal, so it doesn't need many external ones. Does it even need an external CV/NOTE patch point at all? Maybe not.

* tick marks are 1cm increments. So each patch module is in multiple of 25mm x 15mm.  total size is estimated at 150mm x 165mm (roughly 6"" x 6.5"")
* circles are patching points
* circles with the stroke are pots
* USB powered with USB MIDI or OSC
* colours are arbitrary
* waveforms for oscillators are selected in the button matrix, colour indexed
* bottom right is a speaker, power switch and volume control
* name of synth was chosen randomly, might not be the final name. :)

I'm thinking of returning my XL and exchanging it for a synth within the same price range, and the original Microkorg seems like a better choice if I want to edit more efficiently, though I don't know much about the Ms2000, but it supposedly has the same engine as the Microkorg and waaay more knobs.

1359649547.0	17mvjg	Any good soundbanks/downloadable patches for the Moog Slim Phatty?	lolbacon	8	1	8	"Hey, /r/synthesizers,

I just picked up a 2nd hand Moog SP and am having a blast exploring the sounds this beauty creates. Unfortunately the default patch settings leave a lot to be desired. I realize a big part of analog synthesis is designing your own patches, and while I've been experimenting a lot with that (and found it's the only way to get good sounds), I'm still quite a novice sythesist and have trouble replicating some of the sounds I'd like to make with it.

I think importing other patches and deconstructing them would help me figure out how to dial in the sounds I want. I'm looking mainly for fat, grimy bass (which I've found is not hard to get), sharp prog rock and classic funk leads, outer space noises, and everything Devo.

I registered for the KnobTweak group I found on the Moog forums, but waiting for approval and I haven't really seen anything else. Anyone know of or have some cool patches to share?"	t5_2rdyc	True

I have a 1990's Kurzweil K2600x I bought at an excellent deal -- only $150!  It came with a sustain pedal and a midi sampling board and a huge road case.   It's an older synth but according to the internet it's an excellent one.

I don't know anything about synths and I am no performer...I like to make noise and attempt music.   However when I was looking for a digital piano I knew I wanted something with 88-keys and excellent fit and finish with detail given to the keyboard.  I was looking at a Yamaha P-95 but they were too expensive.  After a year of looking I found this beautiful machine, the K2600X.   

It has a ton of features and a massive manual.  It uses a software architecture called VAST.  It seems a little dated but still comprehensive and once you figure out how to layer recordings it actually becomes easy to use.  I've read that some serious musicians used this synth back in the day like Trent Reznor and Pink Floyd.

1357419348.0	160vbr	What do you guys make of the new Korg and Moog rumors for NAMM?	Kidney05	8	1	7	"Basically, a few days ago some pictures leaked of a korg MS-20 reboot as a miniature version of the original synth, and also a supposedly analog keyboard called the King Korg.  I question if the King Korg is really analog (as it is written) or if Korg just loves to throw the word analog around, even for VAs.  I also question why they'd choose a smaller version of the MS-20, but if it was analog and priced as a mini, I'd probably take it and just use the MIDI ports to control it.

Also, later on in the thread (below, page 8 or 9) more than one source claims that Moog is going to unveil a new keyboard at NAMM-- sounds like it's going to be big and new, given that Moog really has kind of maxed out their current formula of monophonic oscillators, down to the cheapest Minitaur.  I'd like to see polyphonic, but I think that price might be insanely high-- what's the best deal they could do, stacking slim phattys together?  at 800 bucks a pop, a four voice would be $3200, and maybe if they were creative they could pump that down to $2500 (given that they'd only need 1 electronic brain, etc).

So what do you guys think?  does anyone have any insider info?

1351508024.0	129pi9	Looking to purchase and need some advice!	AlmostOnTopic	8	2	24	"I will start with some information and the choices:
$2000 budget (give or take a few hundred)
1. Modular synth
2. Prophet '08
3. Grab bag, per se.

I'm looking to expand in my music hardware and I'm having a hard time deciding on which route to go. I figured I would get some good advice from you guys! 

The type of music that I take part in is varied. Some dance, breakbeat, IDM, etc... For the most part, software and midi controllers have been the backbone of how I have been producing. I really want to break out of relying on software for my sounds, so I am looking in investing in some hardware.  I have a few synths such as the Novation Ultranova that I have been working with recently, but I would like to expand a bit further. 

I've been looking into modular synths for a while now and would really enjoy learning to use this type of instrument. They have a very steep price to say the least, but I do like the idea of being able to build your own synth with the parts you choose. I've mostly been looking at the DOTCOM entry-level system and the Doepfer A100 Mini Basic System.

The DSI Prophet '08 seems like an amazing synthesizer. I've been listening to clips, watching youtube videos, and watching reviews and I cant think of many negative things to say. It has a strong background, it's used by some musicians that I really respect (Radiohead, for example), and it seems that the sound would be really fun to manipulate. The main con I have with this purchase would be that it will take my entire budget. This isn't a make-or-break con, but it would be nice to be able to have some budget left over for other items.

The third is full of recommendations. Moog Slim Phatty rack, DSI Mopho keyboard, Moog Little Phatty Stage II Keyboard Synthesizer, Roland SH-201, etc... And whatever you could think to recommend. It would be a mix and match depending on what I could fit into the budget.  I don't have many strict guidelines that I'm trying to meet. I prefer polyphony, but that obviously isn't a strict choice. 

If you guys could give me your opinion or advice I would greatly appreciate it. Also, recommendations are more than welcome! i'm just trying to do some research before spending the money. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR - I have $2000 to spend on a setup! Should I go for the modular moneypit, mix and match a few different synths/other equipment, or spend the entire budget on a Prophet '08?

1341160040.0	vvspz	Can anyone help me diagnose a problem on a Korg Mono/Poly?	usescience	8	2	20	"EDIT: Found the problem. Positive side of C14 on the power supply board popped loose. 

I bought a vintage Korg Mono/Poly that's having a very specific problem and I'm trying to pinpoint the cause. I know the basics and theory of electronics/circuit design/components having taken a heavy course as part of my Physics education, but have almost no practical experience with something like this. I'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction before I start tearing apart and probing everything.

When I power it on, everything appears to be working normally. LEDs come on, I can hear a slight hum from the headphone jack, and I can tweak the frequency and waveform of both LFOs and watch the flashing LEDs respond correctly. The trouble is, I get no sound when I play the keys or try to trigger it via CV, and I believe I know why: none of the KEY ASSIGN MODE buttons light up or respond when I press them (here's a picture for reference: http://www.sequencer.de/pix/korg/monopoly_lfo.jpg). These buttons select which mode the synth plays in (i.e. mono unison, chord memory, poly, etc) and at least one should be selected at all times. The synth should default to unision when powered on, but all the buttons just remain dark. I'm fairly certain that the synth isn't playing because it can't select a mode to play in for whatever reason. The orange effects button to the left of the KEY ASSIGN MODE buttons toggles normally.

You can check out the circuit schematics on the service manual (http://synthdiy.com/files/2007/KorgMonoPoly-ServiceManual.pdf). In particular, in the KLM-356 (mainboard) schematic you can see the KEY ASSIGN MODE switches (labeled SW POLY, SW UNISON/SHARE, SW UNISON, SW CHORD, SW HOLD). I'm not an expert with circuit schematics so I'm having trouble making sense of it all, but I know that at least one of these switches should be active at all times, and it's as though none of them are getting power. Can any of you see on the schematic where the fault might be? I've already tried reseating their connections on the mainboard, which is easily accessible by popping the hood, but all the other PCBs will require some disassembly to reach (see: http://ssevintageaudio.com/wp-content/gallery/keys/korg-mono-poly-restored-inside.jpg). I'm just not sure where to begin here.

He didn't have a place to put them yet, so he set them up in my house (it was like Christmas!).  I'm mainly a guitarist/bassist, but I fell in love with synths during this time. I played around with them quite a bit, but I never learned anything too in depth on them or made any custom presets.  Of these, I loved the sounds of the Microkorg XL and the Kaossilator best.  The Microkorg XL especially had really fat bass to me (don't laugh!) and the best presets (I know these aren't true analog and there is way better stuff out there, I'm aware I'm a noob here).  Anyway, he finally took them back, and now I want to buy a synth of my own.  I have read that the Korg R3 has the same capabilities/sounds as the XL (and more) but with larger keys.  I could get one new at GC for $600 with a $100 off coupon, or I found a used one on Craigslist for $350 OBO.  My question is, would I be better off getting something else for $500?  What are your thoughts on buying used?  I want to record electro/rock and jam with it, I'm not super knowledgeable about synths and I just want good fat bass and clean leads, arpeggiation, chords etc. (pretty much a versatile synth) and I like the XL's sounds.

I'm a bit of a beginner and I've hit a snag

I've been messing around on the Moog Sub Phatty and I found a patch that has the oscillators split so that one oscillator is tuned a major third higher than the other one. 

I came up with a sweet riff, but the problem is that for *just one* note I need the second oscillator to be tuned only a *minor* third higher in order to fit in the diatonic framework of the key. Is it possible to program the instrument so that when I strike certain keys the tuning is one way and with certain other keys the tuning is different? Or do I just have to figure out how to turn the knob with my hand on the fly?

So i recently purchased a Moog Little Phatty Stage II

However the other day I was playing around with a sub phatty and started questioning my decision.

I asked the place if I could trade (not the same place I bought my synth) and they said the value of it is almost half of what I paid for my brand new Little Phatty.

I also just found out theres a VST for the little phatty, which makes things seem a little bit more customizable, not all the knobs the sub has, but still i'm able to see where the parameters are.  But i still want that freedom to mess around with knobs.

So my question is..
if you were in my position, would you try and sell the Little Phatty and get the Sub?  Or keep the Little Phatty.

I'm about to buy my first analog synthesizer but I don't know much about them. I've watched a ton of videos and reviews and I'm torn between the Slim and Sub Phattys.

* The **Sub** seems more ""powerful"" and I like to have all the knob controls in front of me. The multidrive sounds incredible. Overall, it looks more versatile: you can create a larger range of sounds.

* On the other hand, I really liked the **Slim** because of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-HY757mffk Some of the sounds I hear in it are the ones I'm looking for. But as in every demo, it depends on who's making the video (so it's maybe possible to replicate these sounds with the Sub).

My question is: is it possible to make the same sounds as in this Slim video but with the Sub? I could buy the Slim and be happy with it, but if I could have these Slim sounds + full knob controls + multidrive + keyboard for a couple of hundreds more, I'd go with the Sub.

There was some interest so I've added some pages to my blog about the factory mods that Octave offered back in the day, and also some revised schematics that I drew based on two different SRM models.  The schematics that were released with the service manual did not match the actual PCBs nor do either of those match the component layout diagram.  If you have your SRM serviced, you may consider telling your tech about the schematics as it might same them some labor time.

Whenever I look into putting together my own modular synth system I run into the fact that from the big online retailers of modular parts (analogue heaven, synthesizers.com, etc) to put together a basic system would cost between $1500-$2000. Is this just how the modular system game is being run or am I just looking at the wrong (i.e. much higher priced) modules? I assume some brands are essentially the deluxe version (doepfer).

SOOO basically I'm wondering if there are other brands out there with slightly less expensive modules (ie not $200-400 for a single VCO), I've gone through a bunch of pages in analogue heaven but the way the site is mapped out (per brand, not type of module) makes it a chore finding all the oscillators and comparing prices etc.

OR is it just the case that since the demand for these systems is quite low they are able to price the units up quite a bit more...?"	t5_2rdyc	True

Which should I get?	sugarandnoise	9	3	14	I've been wanting to get into this whole synthesizer buisness for a long time so I put out a call on craigslist for synthesizers and got a few bites. One of them is a [Kurzweil K1000](http://www.vintagesynth.com/kurzweil/k1000.php) for $150 and the other is a [Korg MS2000](http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/ms2000.php) (the original, not the reissue with the XLR vocoder) that comes with a hard case for $400. I want to learn how to program and I just bought Reason so the MS2000 would be nice as a MIDI controller. I'm just wondering what everybody's opinion is on each of these and if these are a good deal.	t5_2rdyc	True
1364932089.0	1bjb8c	Alesis Micron for $200?	NOT_KIMJONGUN	6	0	25	"I was recently checking out craigslist and I found a guy who wanted to trade an alesis micron for a regular keyboard/digital piano. I told him that I don't have either of those (I have an entry level, do nothing, flimsy plastic keyboard like everyone else, but he wanted better than that obviously) so I asked him what his price was in cash. He said he bought it for $400 awhile ago and would sell it to me for half that.

 I don't have any other synthesizers or decent midi controllers, is this a good purchase as a first true synth? I understand the major downfall of the micron is the restricted controls, but for $200 I'm willing to fiddle with the menu system. Aside from that major issue, is this a good buy on my part?

Edit: To clarify, it is functional and comes with a gator case, power cables and midi cables."	t5_2rdyc	True
1364865541.0	1bhej8	So much about synths seem to revolve around sequenced loops or drowsy soundscapes. For contrast I'd like to share this track of Vangelis straight up jamming.

It seems like this is something different than the Editor, but my inability to find a download or manual is worrisome. I was wondering if this actually exists? It seems like it would be exceptionally helpful but if it doesn't exist, well then that brings on a whole new set of questions...

1361475743.0	18yzw9	Need Multi-Tier Keyboard Stand Recommendation	mdrsharp	6	0	27	"Can anyone recommend a Multi Tier Keyboard Stand.  The stand will solely be used in my studio and I would like it to facilitate at least 3 keyboards, maybe more since I own some small synths too (maybe 2 synths on a single tier).
It would also need to be strong enough to hold some older analog synths.  

I was considering building my own A-Frame stand from wood until I came across this A-Frame stand from On-Stage Stands http://onstagestands.com/products/view/116973 which looks like it could fit the bill.



Edit: I would like to place 2 (or more) of my smaller synths one a single tier.

Edit 2: I came across this picture of Chromeo's studio, I really like how the synths are hanging off the wall http://cdn.mos.musicradar.com/images/features/chromeo/chromeo-main-640-80.jpg

Hello!

Over at EDM they are having great success with their feedback threads, and it got me thinking. I love hearing what you guys make, and not to mention reading about what kind of gear you used and how you did. I love how its catered to people who are interested in using hardware for their productions.

With a feedback thread it might be more encouraging for people to post. I have thought about posting ""listen"" posts, but I feel bad about it, and I'd rather do it in an established thread where everyone can share.

While this reddit focus more on gear than production, i'd love to hear what you guys make with your gear. EDM is cool an' all, but its all software most of the time, and people rarely share their *process* for production. Maybe when you post music in this thread you'd have to preface it with [genre] and what gear you used? Of course, 100% hardware made music isn't required, but as long as some aspect of it is hardware, it  would be a welcome addition to the thread.

What do you guys think?"	t5_2rdyc	True
