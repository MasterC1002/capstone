I think the pixies are well known enough for this to be unecessary, but I'm saying for lesser known bands, it would be nice to know when the song came out, or if it's something new, as in, it came out this week, as I'm more likely to check out the newer stuff.

DefiantLion	29	8	89	"I'd love to hear other's favorites so I can go check out some other beautiful albums, and I've noticed that people who listen to indie/alternative music tend to have a wider array of tastes. So this is by no means only indie music, I want top ten of ALL musical albums.

Here's mine (in no particular order):

Coheed and Cambria- Good Apollo: I
The Decemberists- Picaresque
Okkervil River- Black Sheep Boy
Death Cab for Cutie- Transatlanticism
The Beatles- Magical Mystery Tour
Tegan and Sara- The Con
Pink Floyd- The Wall
Blink 182- Blink 182
Bloc Party- A Weekend in the City
Modest Mouse- The Moon and Antarctica

So, nothing too unknown there, but maybe someone will see something they don't know, check it out, and fall in love.

Spotify, pandora, youtube, wearehunted, gorillavsbear, last.fm, rhapsody, 8tracks, grooveshark, NPR music, and of course reddit are all great websites for listening to and discovering music.

I have heard people here always complaning about having old music and crappy music.  I figured that I could make a subreddit where we  can post one album a day and see what others think about it.

 I would also like to have a couple of other people to help out with picking out the albums so we can get a diverse selection.

I feel like this can help expose people to new artists and will also encourage people to expand their horizons.

1372574952.0	1hcrjy	Sit down for a minute and let me tell you about The Dear Hunter	SirShakes	23	3	9	"In the following I'm going to rant for some time about my favorite band of all time, and one of the most brilliant and innovative groups I've ever seen. Mingled in will be relevant links to songs, so skip to one of those if you'd just like to have a listen.

The Dear Hunter is a band started as a conceptual solo project of Casey Crescenzo, who was, at the time, guitarist/backup vocalist/songwriter for the pretty cool band [The Receiving End of Sirens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhJ3UO2ItqI) (He's the chubby one). After recording some demos and performing a few of his tracks with this band, he left to pursue it full-time, and recorded the first album, [Act I: The Lake South, The River North](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDbUzmLD_t4) largely by himself, with his brother on drums.

You may notice that this song is *fucking weird.* I'm hoping you also notice that it's god damned amazing. I'm going to try to keep moving before gushing too much, but this varied, experimental style is going to be par for the course.

So I mentioned before that this was a concept album, and you probably noticed it's marked as Act I. So here's where it gets super interesting. There are three ""Act"" albums so far, with another three planned, and they all follow the story of a boy born around the turn of the 20th century, whom Casey only refers to as ""The Dear Hunter."" This story is fucking beautiful.

I'm gonna try to give you a recap in broad strokes, so for those of you who are already curious enough to want to experience it first-hand, I'd recommend against reading this. In Act I, we start with the birth of the boy, as [his mother flees the city, being chased and attacked along the way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqQ7kRj-vqY). It's revealed that she was a prostitute, and she worked at a brothel called The Dime disguised as a church by day, run by a (singular) man known as [The Pimp and the Priest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qs33rTkCQs) *(Conquer your sins while she screams on her back)*. So the boy's mother, dubbed Ms. Terri, raises him away from the city and shields him from her past.

In the beginning of Act II, she dies some time in his late teens, and he decides to seek out answers, and heads straight into the city she kept him from for all those years. Upon arrival, he meets a beautiful young woman named Ms. Leading, who reminds him of his mother somehow. He's enamored, falls in love, and she takes him back to her place... [A room in the back of a church](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSm06SwNI18) (Guess now we know why she reminded him of his mother). Without even realizing what's going on, he meets The Pimp and the Priest, and agrees to work as Ms. Leading's chauffeur. This ends poorly when he catches her in bed with a strange man and realizes what she is. [He decides that he can't be with a prostitute, spurns her](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFX08ssSsLI), and then leaves the city with a broken heart.

Act III: Life and Death. This album especially is deep, complicated, and fantastic, so I'd encourage you again to stop reading and experience it yourself first. The boy does what so many others did when they wanted to escape - he enlists as a soldier in The Great War. [This music video covers a lot of the events of the first half of the album](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAtvzImzGY). Terrified of the reality of war, the boy flees from a battle with a tank, then encounters a woman poisoning soldiers of both sides who offers him a bottle. He's then saved from a mustard gas attack by a soldier from another troop, and is taken back to camp where several soldiers are gathered around swapping stories. [One of the older soldiers speaks fondly of abusing a woman at a certain brothel with a ""silver circle sign.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK0CEklVJKw) In the middle of this story, he looks at the new soldier, our young protagonist, and says ""What was your name?"" Surprise! He's the boy's father. Surprise again! The person that saved him earlier is his half-brother. The brother dies in a later battle, and the father doesn't appear to care, which enrages the boy. [The boy then poisons his father with the bottle he received earlier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq0RQb5FTNQ), and, left once again without anywhere to go, he comes up with the plan to impersonate his half-brother (after realizing how alike they look) and live with his step-mother. The album ends with him reflecting on how much of a mess his life is, and trying to convince himself that one day he'll learn to love again.

If you actually read all that and still aren't convinced that this band is amazing, I'm pretty sure we can't be friends. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

After Act III, The Color Spectrum project was created. Nine EPs, with four songs each, were created to represent each color and the two tones of the visible light spectrum. Each EP is written in a different style, with different musical and lyrical themes corresponding with the feelings associated with the given color. For example, [the Red EP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geV6OkIURoE) is aggressive rock, with loud guitar riffs and lyrics focused on anger and stubbornness. [The Green EP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDpHFD40eE), then, is calm, focuses on a wide range of acoustic instruments, and deals with themes of nature and death.

I'm blowing your mind, right? Now realize that this is all written by a man who fell backwards into this life. He moved for a job as a film editor, then when the job fell through, joined a band just to pay the bills - it was something he'd never pursued professionally. To this day he doesn't know how to read or write music, and composes entirely by ear. He hasn't even studied classical composers, so he avoids predictable chord progressions. Everything about this band is new and wonderful, and I would make love to these albums if I could.

TL;DR - Best band ever. Go back and read some of it."	t5_2qhz6	True
1371645484.0	1gngm3	I've just launched this site to help new/undiscovered bands get more exposure - check it out to find new bands!	andy1717	20	3	9	"I've just launched the site [RecordBox](http://recordbox.fm) for new, small and undiscovered bands to post their YouTube links. The idea is to get them easy exposure without the bullshit of major labels, celebrity judges, etc.

As a listener, the Hot page in the sidebar is useful as it lists the most popular tracks, where you can filter by genre and timeframe. 

There's videos on the About page outlining the basics on how to use the site, although as Reddit users I imagine you'll navigate it just fine (e.g. the heart icon on each post is essentially an upvote).

Check it out, I'd love to know what you think (it has just launched and I'm new to this so please be kind), or if you're in a band see your music on there! If any of you share the same ethos and want to spread the word on the site then it'd be greatly appreciated - the more bands and visitors, the better the site!

Thanks everyone.
(I've have approval from one of the mods, so hopefully this is ok)."	t5_2qhz6	True

Anyway, I finally have some free time this weekend, so I thought I would start putting together my winter playlist. I need some help though. I can't seem to find a lot of songs that fit the mood I want. I don't really know how to describe the feeling, so here's what I have so far:  
[Words of the Revelator - Bryan John Appleby](http://bryanjohnappleby.bandcamp.com/track/the-words-of-the-revelator)  
[Yet Again - Grizzly Bear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bteY_fs3Y18)  
[A Maker Of My Time - The Paper Kites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8A_8rbakgg)  
Last years playlist had some Sufjan Stevens, Noah and the Whale, The Acorn, and Benjamin Francis Leftwich to name a few, if that helps any more.
I hope you guys can get a general sense of what I'm looking for and build from there. Any suggestions would be pretty cool and greatly appreciated!"	t5_2qhz6	True

I'm looking for an album that has a vintage-looking color photo of a girl at a beach holding rocks at the cover.	im_so_meta	16	2	2	She's holding a bunch of big rocks in one hand and in the other she lifts up one rock and is looking at it. There is blue sky in the background. I'm pretty sure the album came out sometime in the 21st century and I think it's some kind of indie music so that's why I post this here.
