**WE ARE JUST TRYING THIS FOR A WEEK**

It's been a while since [the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/123f4c/official_rmashups_post_your_ideas_that_you_wanna/) about new ideas was brought up, So I figured I'd make it clear to everyone what our new rules are.


* Rule 1 - **Please only submit mashups or related content.** If you aren't sure if it's a mashup, listen to it without video. If you can tell it's two or more songs together, then it's a mashup. Remember a mashup is a song or composition created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another.

* Rule 2 - When submitting a link, please title your submission as: **Mashup Artist - ""Song Title (Artist Sampled x Artist Sampled)""**

* Rule 3 - **ALWAYS include a download link to the song/EP/Mixtape/Album you submitted in the comments, or your post will be removed.**




If anyone is willing to step up to the plate, and start organizing a weekend tournament dedicated to making mashups, please contact the mods.

Also if you want to make this place look better please contact the mods, we are desperate for a new look.

And my first assignment was the make this place look awesome. So it took me a while to get it just right. I hope you all like it. It will take some time to get used to it, so thats normal.

As you can see, I've streamlined the sidebar. Its should be way more easily to read and see.

There is no more link downvoting. Thats because of two things. 1) If you see it, one of the mods and approved it. So its fine for /r/Mashups. 2) The whole point of mashups is to mix two or more things together. Sometimes it sounds amazing and other times it becomes a learning experience. Downvoting posts only because they don't appeal to you is not the right thing to do.

So if you like a post, *Turn up the bass*, if not, pass it by or hide it. You can still downvote comments though.

Stay tuned for more goodies &amp; features as they are incremental rolled out.

##EDIT 1

I'm working on the Firefox issue.

##EDIT 2

Fixed.

##EDIT 3

I know of the spacing around the comment arrow. Will fix later.

I just found out that Bonnie Raitt did a version as well. I thought, how awesome would it be if it could be turned into a duet, where Gerry would represent me and Bonnie would represent my beloved. It would be so cool to have this unique version for our wedding. I know it is probably very technically difficult, especially on such short notice, but I thought it couldn't hurt to ask. Anyway, here are links to the youtube videos for those unfamiliar with the song:

1305847008.0	hffxs	How to Make a Mashup	bkbeezy	139	11	42	"So, a while back I wrote a guide on how to make a mashup. It was ok for the time, but since then my skills have greatly improved, as well as my understanding of the process. So, I'm rewriting it.

First things first, you're going to need a few things.

1. A main program to work with. ~~I personally use Adobe Audition (so does Girl Talk). It's fairly robust, but it's usually pretty solid and gets the job done.~~ Another good program is Ableton Live. This has a lot more features, including beatmatching. *EDIT 1/2/12:* I've switched to Ableton Live almost completely now, and I highly recommend it.

2. A BPM tool (if your main program doesn't have one built in). I use Mixmeister BPM Analyzer, which is free. This allows me to quickly and easily find the tempo of a song. Note: BPM tools do not measure acapella files accurately. Measure the actual song to find the tempo of it.

3. Files to work with. For Acapellas, some good sources are: [acapellas4u.co.uk](http://acapellas4u.co.uk) (has a download limit for free accounts), [blacklabelled.com](http://blacklabelled.com), [realraptalk.com](http://realraptalk.com), and [remixboard.com](http://remixboard.com). (all require registration) For instrumentals, check out [blacklabelled.com](http://blacklabelled.com). Instrumentals aren't necessary, but if you find a good one, they can make your life a whole lot easier. 

If you can't find one for the song you want to work with, try sampling instrumental parts of the song. (eg. the intro, drum beat, etc.)

Also make sure to search Google for files. There are a lot just floating out there on file hosting sites.



The easiest way to learn something is to do it first hand. Follow these steps to make an A+B (one acapella over one instrumental) mashup of Say It Ain't So by Weezer + A Milli by Lil Wayne. It's easy to do, high quality acapellas and instrumentals are readily available, and it requires just about no editing the tracks.

1. Get the acapella and instrumental. Download them [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?8p93b2w3zzu617r).


2. Open the program, and import the files.


3. Line up the files as much as best as you can. Look at the waveforms and try to line them up. In this case, there's an obvious intro for each song. The ""mac i'm going in"" part of A milli and the guitar riff of Say It Ain't So. The intro for A Milli is slightly too long, so split the file so the first verse of A Milli lines up with the first verse of Say It Ain't So.


4. That's it. Listen to your first mashup! Video of the process (no sound): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veVekx802Do

Finished product:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9sbJIUYsk4 (this is edited a bit more than yours, and has more than the original two samples)

Some rough guidelines:

* Try not to use overused samples.

* Listen to established mashup artists to learn, if you already don't. Some of the best are Girl Talk, E-603, Super Mash Bros, and Milkman. Study them. What do they do to make their mashups sound good, and how do they do it?

* Use high quality samples. Nothing ruins a mashup quicker than a terrible DIY acapella.

* Make sure the mixing is done well! Bad mixing can easily ruin a song. You want the volumes to be consistent throughout *every* part.

* When you finish a song, save it, then come back to it the next day. I guaruntee you'll hear something that you can change. 

* And most importantly, practice! Don't expect to be good overnight. (This goes for anything, really.) I've been working on mashups for almost two years, and I improve everyday. Study others, too!

I'll post a guide later on getting into more advanced techniques, including transitions.

So Chris Vrenna doesn't hate me or mashups, he finds them silly, and fair enough because they are at the end of the day, it's all a bit of fun and you can't take yourself too seriously. He is however quite supportive of remixes, I have a friend who swears he used to post on GYBO in it's early days. Plus he's giving me the opportunity to remix his band, how fuckin cool is that?

So he's been dragged into this because TMZ needed a scoop, no publicity is bad publicity tho, I'm sure we both got a bunch of hits out of it. Just don't be hating on him because of a celebrity gossip article.

Here is how it works, I will give you a song and you will have 1 week to create your mashup. You will then have 1 day to post it to the contest voting thread. Over the course of the week, we will vote and the top-thread comment with the most votes wins. Voting will will happen by users commenting on the top-thread comment, saying 'you have my vote'.

Additional rules

* Each user may only vote for 1 Mashup. 
* The mashup must be a soundcloud link with download, no youtube.
* You must create the mashup. 
* The target song must be identifiable in the song 
* You must use the orignal song, meaning no covers

Likely, we will revise the rules as we see how this goes. I am excited to see how this turns out!

This contest's song: **Personal Jesus - Depeche Mode**

Edit: This is mod sanctioned and will hopefully become a reoccurring feature, if the interest is there. Obligatory 'up-vote for visibility reminder'

Edit Edit: Date the posting thread will be up(you will have 24 in order to be counted.) Thursday Feb, 7th. at 1pm MST

**https://**soundcloud.com/gls/gls-marathon-mashup-2013

Can we try to link as:

**http://**soundcloud.com/gls/gls-marathon-mashup-2013

The key change being highlighted in bold. This small change means Reddit's media player doesn't die and will actually display the expando properly. I don't believe for a second I'm the only one who finds it annoying to bounce back and forth between SoundCloud and Reddit (or to keep Ctrl+Clicking).
 
*At least until Reddit fixes this issue!* Most of us use RES in order to be able to browse Reddit without leaving it and this small change temporarily remedies that issue.

**Tl;DR Drop the 's' from https so we can have the expando back!**

MetalDart	76	11	14	"So, a few months ago I submitted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mashups/comments/nvj1n/made_a_collection_page_of_mashups_for_friends/?already_submitted=true) and it got a generally positive response. I have been developing my own mashups recently, have over 800+ mashups on my iPod and just love spreading the mashup love. I understand we have a best of the month, but I think that only compromises mashups submitted here. I sometimes like to delve through soundcloud for lesser known songs / artists as well sometimes, and I rarely submit on Reddit...


BUT I LOVE MASHUPS, so if people like what I did above, I have no problem keeping it up. 


I got like 5 followers on the Tumblr from the one day the page was up, but I may update this [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/MetalDart) with mashups more. It would be easier than waiting for me to compile entire lists / fake albums I create, so I would prefer that so there is less formatting on my part. (Plus my other mashup friend wants me to get into Twitter now...)


Thanks for reading!

1369965962.0	1fdn13	"A discussion on ""Mashup"" vs. ""Bootleg"" vs. ""Remix"""	SYKoff	68	5	26	"I've seen a lot of people throwing out the term Bootleg, seems to be a popular buzzword recently. I thought we could have a discussion on what bootleg actually means since people to seem to be using it with no consistency.

First off let me say that I am not Merriam-Webster and I'm definitely not infallible, but the following is what I understand these terms to mean and seem to be the generally accepted definitions. There are of course exceptions to these rules which I'll get into.

**Mashup**: You probably know what this is if you're in this subreddit but I'll list it anyway. Basically parts of one or more songs are played over others. The simplest form of mashup typically involves the vocals or ""acapella"" of one song played over the instrumental of another. 

The typical production process of a mashup is (comparatively) simple. The minimum amount of work required to make one is most often beatmatching the songs, possibly transposing them to the proper keys, and possibly having to warp the audio if one or more the tracks weren't quantized. of course you can get into EQing and properly mastering the tracks but that is not essential (though definitely recommended).

An example of a mashup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuIYBvsYVGI

**Remix**: When the owner of a song authorizes the stems, melody, or recordings to be used by a different artist in the creation of a new song. The amount of original song retained varies from remix to remix but in almost all cases the vocals and the lead melody are used (often altered in some way though). A remix often contains a large amount of new material, this could be anything from drums, instrumentation, chord progression, melody, ""drop"" if it's edm, bassline, etc. and often most of what listed is changed.

The production involved with a remix can vary wildly with some bearing little resemblance to the song their based off of (see [Madeon's Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4) of Deadmau5's [Raise your weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnwfTHpnGLY) for an example) while others keep a large amount of their source material (see: [Flosstradamus's Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnsgDTGIQN4) of Major Lazer's [Original Don](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKKdJoXF7PI) for example)

**Bootleg**: This is the problem child right here. It's an almost completely unnecessary term IMO but I'll share the common definition anyway. Basically an ""unofficial"" remix. Bootlegs are done without the permission of the owner of the original song. Often times this means that the producer doesn't have access to the stems or original recordings so they have to make do with extracting what they can from the finished song. What's important to note is that like remixes, *they require some form of original material*. The amount required is certainly a bit of a gray area, but it requires at least something new to be created by the bootlegger.

Here's an example of a bootleg for ya: https://soundcloud.com/wandw/zedd-ft-foxes-clarity-w-w

**Now why does this matter**: In the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter that much. What really matters is that you enjoy the music. *However* IMO producers should label their tracks properly. When you label a mashup as a bootleg you're claiming (in most cases, there are exceptions) that you did more work than you actually did. Could an argument be made that mashups are a form of bootlegging, I disagree with that statement but yes an argument could certainly be made. If you do that however then why use mashup as a label at all.

In the end what I'm trying to say is that some people (not limited to this subreddit by any means) are using the term ""Bootleg"" as a buzzword. Might as well label it something like ""SYK'S SICKK NASTY NEW MASHUP FILTH"" (obviously that's over exaggerated but I'm trying to get a point across here)

Here's an [article](http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2011/12/das-djing-made-easy-mashups-vs-bootlegs/) that details what I'm talking about btw, if you're looking for more reading material on the subject it's just a quick google search away.

Anyways what are your guys thoughts? Am I right? Am I just a nitpicking asshole? let's get some discussion going.

**PS.** I don't want any witchhunting to come of this so I won't list any examples of what I find to be incorrect labeling. This is more for productions going forward than worrying about fixing every past mistake. 

Also some people have been using the label correctly, they've just been in the large minority from what I've seen recently."	t5_2r2kq	True

The main guideline was that the songs in the playlist had to be released the same month as the playlist.  I haven't really shared the links on reddit.  So I thought I would share the location of all of them.  Enjoy, and comment.  

Updates will occur each month.  Newest playlist will be at the top.  Also note fratmusic has gotten the release every month since the start.

Well guess what? It was. Everyone did an amazing job finding new songs, albums, and mixtapes that the whole community enjoyed. Of course the list still has the same favorite samples (i.e. Bonfire, Call Me Maybe, Somebody That I Used to Know), but it really isn't a bad thing! The artists that appeared more than once are Mashup-Germany (There seems to be a huge craze with him, and I like it) and one of /r/mashup's finest, Focal Fiasco (Great Job, dude! I can't wait for any album you put out). Now as always, here are the stats: Out of 375 submissions submitted 50 were considered for June's Best of.

50 submissions earned 20 or more points

30 submissions earned 30 or more points

18 submissions earned 40 or more points

12 submissions earned 50 or more points

6 submissions earned 75 or more points

We feel this is heavy handed and unjust so we have written and voiced an open letter to raise awareness, hopefully we can appeal to Official.fm and maybe reach a compromise. Whether this is all in vain remains to be seen but you get nothing if you don't try.

We need your help to spread the message as far as we can, this will only make a difference if we have enough support behind it. 

If you are a fan of mashups and don't wish to see thousands of tracks disappearing overnight please take a moment to like/share/tweet/whatever. Let's spread this as far as we can.

--------------------------------

**An Open Letter To Official.fm**

Hey Official.fm,

We thought we were friends, what happened? We supported you in the early days when you were Fairtilizer and stuck with you when you changed to Official.fm. Even the last time when you deleted all our accounts we gave you a second chance and came back.

We helped promote your site to the position it is now and you even provided a mashup category just for us to label our tracks. The lack of copyright complaints and takedowns we assumed was your standing up for fair use and transformative works in the face of those who impose their view of a legally grey area and an untested one in the courts. For that we thank you.

So what gives? Why have you taken the decision to delete all mashup accounts again? If you told us which tracks infringe we would only be too happy to remove them, not all artists and labels are opposed to the promotional power of a great mashup; so why take the heavy handed approach and delete accounts for a minority of complaints?

We are disappointed official.fm. Maybe it's time for us to move on; we won't stop doing what we love but it's heartbreaking to think we won't be doing it together. But if you won't reconsider letting us stay in some capacity you will lose us forever.

Here's the message:

*I believe you have been copied.*
*Hey, this is Aexis. I have some bad news.*

*The previous version of ""Good Times with a Shuriken"" you uploaded, which has ~6k views (love the track, btw), is here: [watch?v=W61QVVCXYTI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W61QVVCXYTI)*

*That video - yours - went up a month ago.*

*Another video by someone else (""DJExtendOfficial"") of the same exact mashup, at roughly 80 views, is here: [watch?v=8j8ae7fhSDM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j8ae7fhSDM)*

*That video went up only a week ago.*

*The videos are exactly the same length. I have played them simultaneously. They are completely indistinguishable.*

*You have the prior claim. This almost certainly means you have been copied. Do something for your originality's sake.*

*Thank you for your time.*

Anyways, I let it go since I know some people re-upload my stuff and don't get a whole lot of views. But this asshole just posted a comment on my [re-upload](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz_cRfRNchg) of the mix. This is what he said ""Wow ! You Take My Mashup ! -__- Come﻿ On Dude""

This guy must be completely retarded. Not only did he just re-upload my mash, but he actually commented on one of my videos proclaiming that I STOLE HIS MASHUP?! What the fuck? And I'm not the only one he stole from too! Here's another one of his [""mash-ups""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObVyM2do-t0&amp;feature=plcp) which he stole from a Youtuber named [SickDrumproducer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9xppaY0alA)

Here's the guys [Youtube channel.](http://www.youtube.com/user/DJExtendOfficial) He has a few videos up of his ""mash-ups"". Maybe one of them could be yours or someone you know.

1348774168.0	10ktqt	Mash-up request: Teenage Mutant Ninja Ducktales	KravenErgeist	53	12	12	"I was inspired by [this 
Jason Munday](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xGAwvRo7-E) song. After listening to it, the fact that the theme songs for Ducktales and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could go together pretty smoothly became apparent. (I don't think the same can be said for the Pokemon theme song, which appears at the end of the Youtube video). Skip ahead to 0:50 or so to see the transition take place.  

I'm an Audacity noob though, so rather than try to legitimately mashup the original versions of the songs (I couldn't find any legitimate instrumental versions for either song anyway), I instead cobbled together a mashup using clips from the above song, which fit together a little easier. I don't currently have access to it from my work computer, but I will upload it when I get home from work. I had limited clips to work with, since neither is a complete song, but I think I managed to get the general idea across.

I'm interesting in seeing a completed version of this mashup with the actual theme songs and not just a cover band. Does anything feel like tackling this?

If not, does anyone know a good Audacity tutorial online that would be helpful for making a mashup? Also, does anyone have access to an instrumental version of either theme song, as the internet has failed this one.

Thanks /r/mashups!

EDIT: [Here's the mashup I made out of the Jason Munday cover.](http://soundcloud.com/dan-pinsky/teenage-mutant-ninja-ducktales) Be warned, it's shoddily put together, the sound levels are off, I didn't have any instrumental tracks to work with, and I had to re-use half the lyrics over again because the source material didn't include multiple verses in some cases, but this should give you an idea of what I was going for in terms of arrangement. If someone with a higher skill level than I were to tackle this, that would be friggin' awesome."	t5_2r2kq	True

1294628349.0	eza4x	My humble suggestion to creators of mashups:	itscrunchtime	49	5	21	"Please sample from a wider variety of artists.  I am so tired of seeing Oasis, AC/DC, Chili Peppers, Queen, Notorious BIG, The Beatles, Beastie Boys, Led Zeppelin, Jay-Z, Metallica, Nirvana, Weezer, and several others that I can't think of off the top of my head, appear in a majority of all new mashups.  

You DJs are talented artists, but you have the entirety of musical history to choose from.  I get that you want music people will recognize, but everything is starting to blend together (and not in a good way).  I think that many would agree that some of the best mashups are those that sample from one popular song and one much less popular (or even forgotten) song.

I love that mashups can be used to revive old-but-still-great music, but please, stop using the same songs over and over.

**TL ; DR:**  Isn't variety one of the main attractions of mashups?
