All of the textures and appeal and energy of Loveless, their landmark 1991 album, are here, but they move in many varied, surprising directions with it. It's a much more experimental listen. There is one instrumental that is essentially a minimalistic drone, and none of the song structures are consistent or predictable. Kevin Shields said they were going in a more impressionistic direction regarding their album's construction, and it definitely shows."	t5_2rpaq	True

**Finished product:**  Thank you, this was fun and weird. http://soundcloud.com/gargantuan13/experimental-music








It will be really experimental and noisy. I'll record it and upload it today. Also, any ideas for sounds or things to include will be used.

(No copy-pasting really long articles or things, please. That's not fair if I have to sing the entire wikipedia article on the Star Wars universe.)

EDIT: Although, singing the entire wikipedia article could be hilarious... some other day.)

EDIT EDIT: I need a cut-off time, so I'll say 3pm E.S.T.

EDITED AGAIN! : This is awesome. I'm thinking it will be a piano driven song. An epic ballad, now.
====================
Literally laughed out loud at omniphilia's comment. Yes, it's going in the song.


You know, you can do more than just make me say awful things. I bet it'd be really weird if I sang your name or if I recited a story from your personal life.

EDIT OF THE EDIT EIDTIRI DID EI FTS:  Okay, it's 3pm, people. Here I go.

EDDWIHFGWH: It's really hard to sing some of this. I have no idea what I'm doing. I guarantee that you will hear sound, though.

EDIT: Dear lord wtf is this thing becoming. It's like The Residents in a blender.

I've been thinking about what I consider *experimental* and what I don't, and I'm really having a hard time coming up with anything other than ""I know it when I hear it."" So I'm interested in hearing any definitions or guidelines that anyone here has about experimental music as a genre or label. 

Of course, it doesn't *really* matter with such a broad label, and you certainly can like something or dislike it and not worry about whether it's experimental or not. That said I don't think it's a useless term either, far from it. (Especially for contributing to this subreddit.)

Any thoughts?

I think we should democratically try to fill in the sidebar a bit more, or at least swap some links.  Things like essential soundclouds, vimeos, and wikipedia articles as they pertain to experimental music, classical and contemporary.  I say democratically because I am too lazy to do it myself.  But also, I enjoy this subreddit and what you all have to contribute.  Since graduating college, I mainly diet on soundclouds, so I'll be linking a few of those -- some of which were posted by others on this sub.

Hi there, I'm a member of the live coding laptop band Benoît and the Mandelbrots and I wanted to share this session we did in 2010. It starts kind of noisy and then it goes darker and more 'drony' and even some beats at the end. Everything is improvised and programmed live. Feel free to ask anything, I hope you enjoy and maybe hear the other tracks in the set.

BTW, that was before a party and the organizer told us to stop after 15 minutes, cause people were getting scared. We were pumping out frequencies between 30 Hz and 60 Hz quite loud, which is not hearable in the recording, but enough to get some people nervous."	t5_2rpaq	True

Currently I am shooting a short film and I am looking for a composer to join the project. I’ve been advertising the position mainly though websites that are focused towards film people. Yet, due to the specific sound I am after I still haven’t found the right person for the job. 

Having been a member of this subreddit for a little while. It’s clear through may of the tracks I have listened to, many of you would be a perfect fit for the role. Also, the fact this is the style of music you are producing already. I think you would get some enjoyment out of this project, which is a huge bonus for me.  

About the project. 

The sound that I am after could best be described as experimental/minimalist. To describe this to an existing artist, I would say ranging from Lustmord, through to a more up beat and less dark version. We are planning for the short to be around 15 mins. 

So, if you would you be interested in this. Please let me know by applying through the mandy.com link. http://www.mandy.com/1/jobs3.cfm?v=55131146&amp;skill=pst&amp;terr=usny

Also, please put that you came via reddit. 

Thanks, M

The Wire gave out a free CD a while back featuring a load of experimental music made by students at a Plymouth arts college (if I recall correctly).  It's a good listen.  A couple of the tracks that really caught my imagination featured recordings of busy crowds, it sounded like crowds at a shopping centre maybe.  The way they were recorded was quite stunning, all the sounds, whilst recognisable, took on a detached, distant and dreamlike quality making it quite an eerie listen.

Does anyone have any recommendations for music of this type?  Field recordings, but of busy environments - cities, shopping centres, streets, that kind of thing.  Suggestions much appreciated.

PS I can host that compilation online somewhere if anyone's interested in it.

edit: thanks for the recommendations guys. much appreciated - upvotes to you all. i'll be checking them all out. "	t5_2rpaq	True

[Puredata](http://puredata.info) - Extremely powerful. Open source. It does audio processing at the smallest level. You build synthesizers and audio manipulation tools from the ground up. There is wonderful documentation and tutorials to be found on youtube.

[MaxMSP](http://www.cycling74.com) - The more expensive, prettier version of PD. Both have an active community at /r/MaxMSP .

[Fscape](http://www.sciss.de/fscape/) - Very awesome audio manipulation tool. Not in real-time, but has some very awesome capabilities.

[Soundhack](http://www.soundhack.com/freeware/) - very much like Fscape, but I think I may prefer it, although it only works on Macintosh.

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) - This is where I do all my mixing. I'm getting ready to check out LMMS for an alternative DAW option.

[SPEAR](http://www.klingbeil.com/spear/) - Spectral analysis and manipulation. Uses Fourier analysis and allows the user to manipulate individual bands of frequencies. It's really quite cool, but will smear sounds with sharp formants.

I do a lot of synthesizing of tones, and then the production of those tones, in Puredata. I then mix those with live or manipulated sounds in Audacity. I don't have the budget to get something fancy like Ableton, although I'd like to, because it would make many things like automation of filtering easier.

So here it comes - what software does /r/experimentalmusic use? Thanks for your input!

Edits to include your input:

[Adobe Audition](http://www.adobe.com/downloads/cs2_downloads/index.html) - A free DAW, support has been withdrawn. Looks promising.

[Metasynth](http://www.uisoftware.com/MetaSynth/index.php) Has some neat features bundled into one DAW. Mac only.

[SoundMagic Spectral Suite](http://www.michaelnorris.info/software/soundmagic-spectral.html) - A spectral synthesizer with other effects, like granulation. AU plugin, Mac-Only.

[SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) - No idea how I could have forgotten this. It's the formal code version of PD (not graphical), if I remember correctly. Object-oriented sound programming.

[AudioSculpt](http://anasynth.ircam.fr/home/english/software/audiosculpt) - the prettier, less free version of SPEAR.

[Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/) - It's 60 bucks for a discounted liscense that I'm guessing everyone on here would qualify for. Looks like a promising DAW.

[Paul's Extreme Sound Stretch](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/) - will stretch out a sound file to extreme lengths with very smooth blending of grains. I believe a famous Justin Bieber song was stretched famously this way.

[AudioMulch](http://www.audiomulch.com/) - if PD or Max scare you, but you want to use them anyway. Many more built in functions, and prettier. Not free, but much cheaper than Max.

[Bidule by Plogue](http://www.plogue.com/products/bidule/) - Also in the vein of AudioMulch and PD. Also pretty and not quite free. Compatible with VST's and ReWire protocol. Looks like it has pretty intuitive FFT spectral processing in real time.

&gt;The best of the worst of the worst of the best"" is the best way to describe V/Vm. From hacked up and spewed out pop to full on noise assaults since 1996 V/Vm has been terrifying, annoying and illuminating ears and minds. There is a style whilst at the same time there is no style is the V/Vm attitude. People seem to love or hate V/Vm and there is no inbetween as opinion is forced.

Here are links to his [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com/artist/V%2FVm) and [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/VM).

Over the course of his long career, V/VM has released a large number of MP3s online. Many of them, and specifically the ones I am looking for, were released under Creative Commons licences to allow for free redistribution. There were also quite a number of MP3s available through his Vukzid sub-label, which were also released for free. So, just to be clear, I'm not asking for anything illegal here. All if these MP3s were released for free, with the expectation of redistribution. Here's [a full list of them](http://www.discogs.com/label/Vukzid). 

This brings me to the reason I've come to you, the good people of Reddit, for help. 

I can't find these things anywhere.  Actually, I can't find the things by V/VM himself anywhere (except for White Death, which is available on Bandcamp.)  I've scoured torrent sites, blogs, forums, the Internet Archive; everywhere I can think to search. Now, I turn to you. 

**TL;DR:** If anyone out there has a stockpile of Vukzid and V/VM Test Records MP3s let me know. I'm willing to trade in MP3s and the like. 

I've also cross-posted this to [r/electronicmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic), [r/ambientmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/ambientmusic), [r/experimentalmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/experimentalmusic) and [r/industrialmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/industrialmusic).

I figured I'd link to [my soundcloud page](http://soundcloud.com/id-loomwhich) where I've posted to albums of material. I also just set up a [little blog](http://www.idloom.blogspot.com) as a hub for my stuff.

I would also like to connect with other experimental artists out there. You can reach me at SoundCloud or PM me or whatever you like. 

TL;DR listen to me; vote for me if you like; let's be friends?

For some reason I was doing this and I started saying her name over and over and now she's become a part of the song. I'm singing ""Lady Gaga"" in the song, over and over (laughs).

What I'd really like to find is something akin to power electronics that won't bring the FCC down on our heads - so no cursing, rapey murdery, or racist lyrics.  Or even something more melodic like Klaus Schulze, but much less subtle.

Hope that makes sense.  Thanks for any suggestions you can give."	t5_2rpaq	True
