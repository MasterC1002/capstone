I love this subreddit, but I can't cook (the last time I tried to make Ramen I burned the water).  I recently just upgraded my server, and I'm more able to cater to specific subreddits.  I wanted to add a section for you guys of pictures that you use often.  I'm thinking of things like spatulas, knives, bowls, pans, pots, slices of bread (???), etc.  Looking through the comic-recipes people have made, it seems like almost every one of them requires specific pictures of that meal being made, so I'm not sure how realistic this is, but I figured I'd offer.

Basically, is there anything I can do to make it easier for you guys?  If you can send me pictures, or at the very least, links to pictures, I'll start adding them to the ""fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud"" section right away.  If there's anybody that wants to help me make these pictures (transparent backgrounds, resizing, etc), I certainly won't say no.

Thanks for your time!"	t5_2scj2	True

**FREE PDFS:** The new cover is [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52759254?secret_password=15a7s6qsh14x2povn5w4), and the new inside pages are [here](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52759348?secret_password=2457k619l9f9evd1pye), both scribd links. This version has a 0.125 inch bleed included, so you might want to cut that much off on each side. For this version I changed the page size, fixed some typos and other little things, and made a brand new wrap-around cover (with 'celebrity endorsements'!). The old versions you can find through the link at the top of this post, but this one has some mistakes fixed so it's nicer :).

**EDIT: [Current state of affairs](http://redd.it/v7ugu) with respect to publishing an improved version of the Hungry as Fuck cookbook.** Click the following if you have: [no idea what's going on](http://www.reddit.com/r/hungryasfuck/comments/v7ufg/hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_the_story_so_far/)

But I might as well put up a pdf. I sort of decided not to craft anything for this exchange, but I found out my giftee lives very close to me (cheap shipping!), so I just can't resist :D. He likes /r/food and f7u12, but I don't think he's discovered this subreddit yet. I hope not at least, that would spoil the surprise ;).

So, give me your favorites! Anything that uses products that we can't get/subsitute for over here in Europe are out. Please suggest substitutes if you know any.

Also, any ideas for the design in general, the title page, or how to organize the recipes are very welcome. I'm shooting for something simple, so I can just put in Indesign very quickly. The page layout is going to be hard enough to figure out already, with all the different image sizes ;). 

I'm thinking our subreddit logo for the title page, does anyone have a higher quality pic of that?

Disclaimer: obviously I'm not going to sell this or anything, and if I have enough time I'd love to attribute everything to the correct thread and such. But I might not be able to, depending on how long it takes me to put in all the images. If you submitted here and *don't* want to be in a compilation cookbook, let me know."	t5_2scj2	True

**Below is some legal info, to clear up some question from the last post**

For a paper version, the recipe authors will probably have to give some rights to the publisher, to make sure nobody gets sued. This would include the right to distribute the recipe and the right to make changes that might be needed to make it fit for publishing. IANAL but as far as I know this is a form of licensing, I can't see any reason why it would be necessary to sign over full copyrights.

All recipes will be attributed, if possible. I am not taking credit for the recipes, the rage faces or the f7u12(d) phenomenon, and will definitely correct anyone who thinks I made all of it. The attribution in the book itself will show this clearly.

Apart from some information about a few specific ones, I've not found much general information about copyright on rage faces. I guess that comes with community creation. Seeing how many people already make money off the rage faces and how little lawsuits came from that, it'll probably be all right. Once this project gets really serious we'll figure it out in more detail. Thanks to the people who brought this up and gave more info about some specific faces."	t5_2scj2	True

1303835317.0	gxvc3	"Do we still want to properly publish an awesome 
cookbook? If so, there are some things that need 
discussing..."	afrael	112	19	51	"So, if you missed everything: a couple weeks ago I made [a cookbook full of recipes from this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/gj7k2/as_promised_heres_a_cookbook_d/) for my bookexchange giftee and posted it to this subreddit as a pdf. Because a lot of people asked for it, I then put it up [on lulu](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) for the people who didn't have printers, and made a new and improved pdf for the people who had not gotten around to printing it yet ;). I'll take the book off lulu about 2 weeks from now, so if you still want one you'll have to be quick!

There's been a lot of talk about making a proper book with a publisher, and I've been contacted by people who are interested in publishing it. The reason I'm posting this: it's not going to happen without you all, so I figured we need to get our expectations and priorities straight. Below I've written some discussion points, and my own thoughts and interpretations. Please discuss! :D.

*Discussion points:*

1. **Who does what?** As you can see, I'm taking the lead in this project, as well as doing a lot of the work involved ;). The publisher will do a lot of work as well, and have a say in many things based on their experience and expertise. I do view this as a community project, but it's going to be hard to be productive if everyone needs to be involved at all times. So IMHO this should be like a 'benevolent dictatorship': I'll do my absolute best to go about this project with integrity and respect towards this community, to ask for feedback and explain what's happening. In return I'll need you to trust that the publisher and I will do the right thing for the project, and respect our decisions. If you need to know more about me before you feel you can trust me, please don't hesitate to AMA or check out my comment history :). 

2. **What is the timeline?** I think we need to wait a little more, at least a few months, and gather more possible recipes. I personally would like to make the book a lot thicker than it is now, so the more recipes are submitted, the better. I'm thinking about starting discussions with publishers in 3 or 4 months, and then see what happens. Also, I'd like to be graduated by the time we get to the actual work of putting the book together, so I can work on it full time for a while. Either way, it might well be that it won't work out with a publisher, but at least it'll be an interesting experience. Self-publishing is of course always an option too, but doing this with a publisher is way cooler and easier.

3. **What about the recipe authors? Part I: permission.** For the previous book I didn't get any permissions, because that wasn't supposed to be such a big thing ;). I did attribute every recipe (when possible), and I would of course do that for the next version of the cookbook as well. However, if we actually want to publish something for real, it can't go forward without official and legal permission from recipe authors. 

4. **What about the recipe authors? Part II: money.**  A publisher will only want to publish this if they think they can profit from it. I will only want to work for this if there's a good chance I'll be paid for my time, because I need to eat ;). There are about 35 recipe in the current book, and it took me a couple days to create a somewhat passable version, for which I didn't bother too much with picture resolutions, font size, kerning, etc etc. I'd like the next book to have lots more recipes. Lots of recipes means lots of authors and lots of work for me/the publisher. So, after thinking about all of the previous sentences, I don't think it's realistic to assume there's going to money to pay 50 or 60 or 70 or more recipe authors. Maybe if it's an overwhelming success we can send you each a copy for free, but I don't know if that's possible. Of course this is something a publisher has a much better handle on, so I might well be wrong, and then we'll all be rich :D. It's definitely something to think about though. Will this change your opinion of the project? Is this (un)acceptable? I'd love to hear your opinions.

5. **Would you be ok with changes to the recipes?** Some recipes might need changes to make them ready for publishing, for instance because the pictures are blurry, because they're just a little bit too wide or too long, because things are misspelled, because the instructions are unclear, because they use ingredients that are local to somewhere, etc. Of course this is partly a legal issue, I assume you'll sign for this when you give permission to be included, I think no publisher will go near it if you don't. I would like to think that we'd work with the authors if possible, but that might not be practical depending on the volume of changes and the number of authors. Is this acceptable?

6. **How will I keep you up to date or ask for feedback?** I don't want to keep spamming this subreddit if that's in any way unwelcome. But I do want to be transparent about this project, and open it up for occasional feedback. Should I make a new subreddit/blog/whatever to discuss the project or keep it in here? Mods, maybe you can weigh in on this, it's your subreddit ;). Obviously the frequency of posts etc will all depends on the publisher as well, I'm not sure how much feedback and transparency they'll be comfortable with. I've made /r/hungryasfuck because why the hell not, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate forum.

7. **Any other suggestions/thoughts/concerns you'd like to discuss?**

One more thing: I've already received a rather unpleasant message about 'selling out' when I first posted the cookbook, so I figured I should address it before some troll derails any productive discussion we might have. I have to admit I'm not super-involved in the 'f7u12 culture', I just enjoy browsing f7u12(d). The reason I'm behind this project is that I just really like your recipes, and think it'll be AWESOME to have a proper real cookbook of them. I don't expect to become super-rich from this, AFAIK most publishing endeavors don't rake in the cash, I just hope it'll cover the amount of work I'll put in ;). If all this makes me a sellout somehow, that's ok. This cookbook thing is not going to happen if you guys won't give permission to be included, so yeah, that would be it then. Either way, I loved the overwhelming positive reaction the current incarnation of the cookbook got, so if this project doesn't happen I'll always have that ;). Thank you all :D.

tl;dr: We're (hopefully) making a recipe book with recipes from this subreddit, with a publisher. Just read the bold discussion points and give your opinion about them.

Two of my friends are amazing chefs and they're doing the main courses. I'm responsible for the dessert. My culinary triumphs include almost burning down my apartment toasting a bagel.

Can anyone suggest an amazing, yummy dessert that will impress my wife and friends that is actually doable by someone who is terrified of scary terms like baste or garnish?

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! My next step is to try making some of these wonderful desserts in preparation for the main event. And before you ask, yes I have the #1 most important tool for my culinary endeavors: a fire extinguisher.

EDIT 2: I should have put this here rather than create another thread. Sorry I'm still a Reddit newbie. One colossal failure due to my own incompetence, and one huge triumph.

CHECK OUT [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) THREAD - I've put the cookbook up on lulu.com at cost price and am accepting donations, details in that thread I just linked. 

I'm pretty sure I spammed everyone in this thread with the link, I'm really sorry if I messaged you twice by accident ;).

THE OLD POST is below, please ignore everything after this line.

-------------------------

The other thread got a bit crazy, if you're really interested post here. 

I'm gonna put the price at 15 euro a piece for EU countries, and 17 for anywhere else in the world, without tracking number/insurance/garantees. That's more than they cost to print and send, because I'll have to bind them myself and my time isn't free. **This price is for printing, shipping and waving it goodbye when I leave the post office.** And no, I don't know how much that is in dollar. I'm guessing it's about 25, but we'll figure out currencies later.

Printing will be on regular 90grams white laser printer paper, and print with a color laser machine (just like I did for the one in the picture). Binding involves a black metal coil, a sheet of white card stock on the back, and a plastic sheet in the front to protect the cover.

I will write or draw something on the title page if that amuses you ;).

This will be a go at 10 people at least. We can figure out how to transfer money/addresses when we hit that point.

**EDIT: To make it abundantly clear what the deal is here, this is what I said to jhh4321 below: Yes, I'll make some money of this. This is not to pay me for the work of putting all this together, this is to pay me for binding all these ones by hand, because that's shit work.**

I sure hope everyone will print it them, because that saves me the time of making them and the work of making sure everyone sends me money and gets a copy. So please do, check out Kinkos or another print shop, or see if you/your parents/friends/someone else can print one at work.

But now that I released it, it would make me sad if there were people that really couldn't get it, like maniacnf, who comments it costs them 55 dollar to print in their local printshop. That's just not right. That's the only reason I would go to the print shop and bind this things for you guys.

**PLEASE DON'T GET THIS FROM ME TO SUPPORT OR THANK ME!** As long as you guys stay awesome and help me with the next one, and buy that, that would be great. Then we'll do it through an actual publisher, and I won't have to lovingly hand craft each and every one of them ;)"	t5_2scj2	True

(Not mac and cheese type cheese sauce though where you make a roux then add milk then add cheese.)

*EDIT:

So I tried a bunch of the suggestions:  I started with 3 tbs of butter and 3 tbs of flour.  Made a roux. Then I added milk (whisking) until I got the consistency I wanted.  I lowered the heat and added cheddar cheese, american cheese and taco bell sauce packets (I used 3 mild and one hot sauce packets.)  It had sort of the consistency that I wanted and the flavor was too mild.  I think I need to experiment with different cheeses (perhaps pepperjack as suggested).  The American cheese really did change the texture of it.  I used about 3 slices of the american (singles, publix brand) and a few handfuls of a medium cheddar.  Also, I think some jalapenos would've been delicious.  After making two servings of nachos, I had a little less than a cup of sauce left.

Buns as soft as angel feathers, the sweet taste of divinity released at every nibble, the pinnacle of delight, the peak of pleasure, every piece of being transformed into pure light when cuddled between the enchanting embrace of Martin's two loving cheeks.  

Martin saw truth in the world, and he gave of his wisdom freely to anyone who with hunger would listen.    

Now; banished to nowhere, exiled in a cultural deadland for sins I shall leave unmentioned, wretched and outcast, forced to suffer my remaining days in this third world hellhole (Oslo) where nothing as pure or worthy as Martin shall ever reside: I find myself sans hope and purpose. Without my trusted companion, what am I? Lost, beaten, unholy. Wretched.  

Every morning the same ritual, every day to wake up in his glow, to turn around and reach out and ... a mirage. A cruel joke of the subconscious.   

Yet again, today again, he is nowhere to be found. I left him and he did not follow. Alas, the cruelty! The regret! The misery! Oh God the misery!!

And what I mostly mean by that is I love General Tso's Chicken from Chinese food restaurants. I've seen many recipes on the internet that claim they match the restaurant quality, however after many trials I still have not found any success. I've heard from a friend who used to work at a Chinese food restaurant that they use sauce out of a jar and they don't actually make it from scratch. So I guess what I really seek is how to make that out-of-the-jar sauce from scratch. They sell General Tso's sauce at my local grocery store, but all they say in the ingredients is ""spices.""

I fucking love this subreddit so much. It seems like everyone who likes to cook has at least 2 or 3 dishes that they can make and knock the fuck out of the park. For me personally, I think the best comics have pictures of the process of making the food, along with the finished product.

I have made a lot of the stuff I have seen here and it has all turned out awesome. This weekend, I propose we all cook our one dish that always turns out amazing, document the process, and make an excellent comic to be submitted sunday night.

Then we will have an influx of excellent meal ideas for next week and beyond.

1300002800.0	g30g2	Stuffed Dates, Dawg.	volunteeroranje	31	10	6	"Wants some delicious dates? easy.

ingredients:

Pitted dates

Bacon (hell yeah)

Cheese (I like Havarti but anything pretty much works, cheddar and american might be weird though)

Prosciutto (i had it around but you could use any meat)

Balsalmic vinegar

Baking sheet 

wrack, broiling pan, etc. - something to lift these so they don't sit in grease in the oven



Steps:

Preheat oven to 375 

Cut a date down one side (leave the other side) so you have a butterflied date. 

Repeat, now you have 2.  

take a little cheese and put it on one and put some prosciutto on top.  You don't need a lot at all.  I made 8 using 1 big slice of Havarti and 1 and a quarter big slices of prosciutto.

Take the other butterflied date and put it on top so it kind of looks like one big date with stuff in the center.

Cut a strip of bacon in half.

Wrap the bacon around the date.  Wrap it the same way the date goes, leaving the holes on either end uncovered.

 Repeat these steps until you have as many as you need.  I usually wait to put all the bacon on at once.

Cook these at 375 for 20 minutes, give or take a minute. 

Pull them out, let them cool for a couple minutes then serve with a little balsalmic drizzled on top.  I made a white wine, balsalmic and rosemary reduction sauce the first time (it wasn't that great for the effort compared to regular balsalmic vinegar) so you can definitely get creative.  

I've made these with Havarti and Feta, you can change the cheese and meat around to whatever you want.  Don't worry if you don't like dried dates normally.  They taste much better wrapped in bacon and baked.  They become soft and sweet. 

Awesome.

edit: shit, I don't know how to make ffffffuuuuuuuuuuu comics.  please forgive me.  if they are super easy and I am a dumbass for not knowing, help a brother out.  Otherwise, enjoy some ballin' stuffed dates.

1315015207.0	k34jw	What was your worst cooking disaster? (Feel free to imgur a rage comic)	hazardousnorth	23	6	15	"Okay, so, there's two from me. 

The first one (and [here's the rage comic for it](http://i.imgur.com/IUMPq.jpg)) was technically my mother, who actually won a contest in a magazine and $1500 &amp; a Williams-Sonoma gift card (I don't recall the amount) as the grand prize for her cooking disaster. 

Dear old mother was preparing Peking duck (whose preparation entails soaking the bird in an ice water bath and then, after tying off all possible points of egress, exhaling into the neck or using a bicycle pump to slowly inflate the skin away from the carcass.

Well, my mother did not have a bicycle pump, and being a mild asthmatic, she was understandably unable to inflate the bird on her lungpower. 

She did, however, possess an air compressor. 

She had strung the bird from the pan rack over her center island and thence initiated inflation. However, her attention was diverted by, I assume, one of her many pets, and thus she failed to monitor the progress of inflation.

Do I need to finish this story? Of course the point of no return came and went and the bird, having reached critical mass, went supernovae, completely covering her cucina in a cold canard carcass coating.

The other (for which I will not be making a rage comic as the flash plug in crashed when I was almost done making the first one and so had to start all over and so now am tired) was when I threw a huge dinner party and all these people RSVP'd and then didn't call or anything to cancel, and only three people showed up (I had prepared for at least 12) and I made an impressive (and expensive spread) and I burnt the creme brulee and then everyone shows up because I forgot it was daylight savings day and the time I told everyone to show up was an hour later than I'd thought.

* [Extracted Essence of Bacon \(Among other items\)](http://www.foodnetwork.ca/ontv/shows/Food-Jammers/video.html?titleid=97053)

One of the easy sauce I can remember and easy to make is Teriyaki sauce:

- Mirin (sweet cooking wine)
- Soy sauce (the salty one, not the thick, sweet one)
- [OPTIONAL1] Some gingers (that's my option usually) or something that you like. Paprika or onion perhaps?
- [OPTIONAL2] Sesame seed

How?

- Mix mirin + soy sauce with 1:1 ratio (but of course, you can always change it, if you like) on a saucepan. And dude, always TASTE it first before proceeding to next step.
- Add the OPTIONAL1 stuff...
- Add some water if you want it to be lighter.
- Oh, did I mention to boil them as you go along? You probably should, especially if you add the ""OPTIONAL1"" into your sauce.
- After it boils and you're happy, add the sesame seed if you want to, and you're done!

1298948813.0	furx4	ffffuuur so-called gumbo. Here's how it's done.	leita	7	1	3	"As the Southerners say, ""First you make the roux.""

Take equal amounts of bacon grease and butter, get it spackling hot (but not smoking) and add an equal amount of flour. Stir until the it looks a little glossy and dust with more flour. Keep stirring, adding flour dustings until it stops shining. This takes approximately two weeks (or seems so, anyway.)

Cook the flour/oil mixture over medium heat, stirring without stopping, until it looks like dark chocolate. It should smell nutty but not burnt. If it should start to burn, the neighborhood critters will love it for a snack but you get to start all over again.

Once it gets dark brown, up the heat a bit and start dumping in chicken stock and stir until tennis elbow starts setting in. At this point the hard part is done and the rest just takes time...lots of time.

Add your favorite amounts of onion, celery, tomatoes (I cheat and use stewed in a can), garlic, bay leaves, okra, red pepper, a few jolts of Tabasco, Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper. Add a little water, wine or chicken stock if it looks thick. At this point it should be quite thin, more like a broth, not thick like gravy (that part comes later).A few hours later, add at least couple cups of peeled smallish shrimp. They'll pretty much disappear and that's okay.

This is the first layer that cooks pretty much all day. It'll be medium-dark in color and will crust over as it cooks. Stir those yummy crusts back in as they'll add to the flavor and color. At the end of the day remove from stove. Put the whole pot in the fridge and go to bed.

Day Two -

Heat it back up and add at least three teaspoons of liquid Crab Boil (double this amount if the people eating like extra-hot like we do). Everything should pretty much be liquefied at this point so you'll want to add fresh vegetables to the noxious potion for a good texture. Chop up more onion, celery, okra, fresh tomato and toss it in. By this time it should be almost black.. that's what you want. Swamp juice! Toss in a few blue crab bodies, more shrimp, and any other seafood you're fond of. It should look rich, but not so thick to spackle a wall.

Cook some rice w/ a bit of butter, salt and chopped up parsley. A sticky rice rather than smooth seems to work best but it's personal preference.

Here's where I differ from my family. Granny used to add gumbo file' to the entire pot before serving. My mom thought it made the gumbo stringy and I'm on the fence so I add about a tablespoon near the end, stir it in, and put the file' jar on the table so it can be added in as desired. Both ways work for me. By this time I'm so hungry I don't care.

I serve this mess over the rice with a healthy-sized spoonful of fresh picked blue crabmeat as a garnish.

Buy yogurt. Any kind, but greek is best. Greeks are sexy. If you get organic there'll be a payoff later.
Get one of those strainers that looks like a big spoon made out of a screen door.
Get a coffee filter, the basket kind.

Put the filter in the strainer and the yogurt in the filter. Balance them over the sink or a bowl or something so that the liquid runs out and away. Go away. For, like a day. At least.

Come back when it's a wad of spreadable cheesy stuff and a puddle of really weird looking greyish water. That's the whey, drink it, it's good for you, builds muscles.

Stir something into the cheese -- garlic works, or honey and walnuts, or chopped parsley. Not all of those.

Roll the wad up into a nice ball, cover with plastic wrap, shove in fridge.

Get a girl to come over to your house (that part's your problem).

Serve her this cheese on a wooden cutting board with some whole grain crackers. Tell her you made it yourself. She will fuck you, I promise, I'm a girl, and I know how our minds work. If you've used organic yogurt you'll get a blowjob too (told you that will pay off)

    The recipe:
    2 cups yellow corn meal
    1 1/2 cups king author all purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp cayenne
    1/2 cup corn
    1 large jalepeno
    1/2 cup sugar
    4 eggs
    2 medium sized onions

Mix the corn meal, flour, cayenne, baking powder, salt together in a bowl. Put enough of the onion in a food processor and liquify it and measure out 1 cup of the slush. Leave 1/4 of an onion to fine dice. Fine dice the jalapeño. Mix the 4 eggs, corn, jalepeño, sugar, and onion in a bowl. Use a large spoon and stir in the flour and corn meal mixture. 

Heat some oil in a pan to 350 degrees, or so. Using two teaspoons scoop out a dollop about half the size of a golf ball and use the back of the other spoon slide the mixture into the grease in the shape of a football. Fry for a few minutes or until nice and brown.

Next time I make it I will probably replace 1/2 cup of the flour with another 1/2 cup of corn meal and I will probably reduce the backing powder by 1/2 tsp since they did puff slightly more than I wanted. "	t5_2scj2	True
