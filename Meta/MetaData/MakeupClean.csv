For my daughter's dance recital, her instructor requested ruby red lips like Dorothy's slippers.  I bought her a bright red lipstick, but after seeing the other girls during dress rehearsal, I failed.  These girls had lips that looked like they kissed the ruby slippers and it rubbed off on the lips.  I've asked other parents what the trick is, but they won't say.  As a dad, this area is very foreign to me and I thought I'd ask for some guidance.  Thanks in advance."	t5_2qrwc	True

1363101287.0	1a5fc7	Saw an album of porn stars' before and after makeup that made me question my makeup-applying abilities. Need help figuring out what I'm doing wrong! [Link below] (x-post r/MakeupAddiction)	Oh_My_Sagan	38	8	30	"So if you haven't seen it, [here](http://imgur.com/a/ynkv8) is the album in question. It blew me away. It's essentially photos of dozens upon dozens of porn stars, pre- and post-makeup. It's mostly their faces and clothed upper bodies, for those of you who may be browsing in public/at work.

After looking at what these women [and their makeup artists] can do, I think my routine needs some fine-tuning.  A little about me: age twenty, very fair skin, some freckles, dark brown/reddish hair, green eyes [pupils are often freakishly large, so my eyes look dark a lot of the time...?], thick eyebrows.

Here's what I look like today: [1](http://imgur.com/h0znF2e) [2](http://imgur.com/2bO0OO7) [3](http://imgur.com/UiF8U6l) [only have on light concealer and mascara]

My makeup routine usually consists of:

1. Maybelline Fit Me concealer on the bridge of my nose, which can get very red, and on red spots [dabbed on with my finger]

2. brush on Bare Minerals powder, but it's usually pretty much gone by the end of the day  :/

3. mascara on upper lashes

4. I just bought a brown eyebrow pencil that I've been experimenting with, but I have no idea what my brows should even look like since they're so full anyways

5. sometimes I add a little eyeliner and shadow, but it's usually under-done and it definitely doesn't make my eyes *pop*

6. I will also occasionally put on chapstick or lipstick [I only have two! a red one and a very sheer brown one]

So as for the photos, I'm specifically talking about:

* skin in general - how do they get it so clean and smooth and even? They covered up blotchiness and spots and all! I recognize that this type of makeup is for shooting movies, so the makeup has to be heavier in general, but there must be a way to apply makeup like this for everyday wear, no?

* eyebrows - how did some of them go from having sparse/no eyebrow hair to having perfectly-arched brows, while still remaining to look natural/non-clown-like?

* eye makeup - how do you apply eyeliner like that?! Like I said, I tend to under-do my eye shadow and eyes in general since I'm afraid of overdoing it. Any favorite tutorials or beauty graphics I should know about?

* glow - is there a way to make my skin glow like that without looking shiny or using Photoshop [which I don't think they were]?

* any other tips/tutorials you'd like to share? How do I pull any of this off without overdoing it?!

* a few favorite looks: Rilee Marks, Chanel Preston, Proxy Paige, Tori Black, Aria Amor, Liz Ashley, Asphyxia Noir, Sierra Cure, Penny Pax, Sally Sparrow.... wow, there are a lot on here, but hopefully you get the idea!

ANY and ALL help would be appreciated! I'm going to keep browsing this awesome subreddit for more tips. Sorry for typing so much - I tried to break it up so it wasn't one huge wall of text  :]"	t5_2qrwc	True

I tried the Sephora + Pantone Color IQ Foundation Matching Tool in San Francisco yesterday, which promises to end the frustration of selecting a foundation shade. I was really interested to see how it works and I am happy to say that this system is as amazing as it sounds.

A Sephora technician presses a handheld tool to 3 areas of your skin and finds the average of the 3 shades. The average is called your Pantone Skintone Number. You enter your number into an iPad and view all of the shades that match your skintone. You can filter your results by preferences such as skin type, foundation formula (liquid, powder, TM, etc). After that, the Sephora employee will apply some of your foundation matches to your skin to see what you think.

I got matched up to Clinique Superbalanced Makeup in Nude Beige and I was so impressed with the result. It wasn't really a color that I would have picked out myself, but it looked much more healthy and natural on my skin than the shade I was wearing when I came in (oops). 

I was so excited when I left the store. Sephora + Pantone Color IQ is super fun and effective. It's currently only available at the Sephora stores in NYC Times Square and SF Powell St, but they have plans to launch in more stores in the Fall.

The technician gave me a lot more information about the system so let me know if you have any questions.

I have more details about the process (and sneaky cell phone pics of the devices) here: http://www.nicolereviewsbeauty.com/2012/08/does-sephora-pantone-color-iq-actually.html

I spoke to my doctor about this and she kind of convinced me that allot of men on tv wear makeup etc and it's ok.

So anyway she said that it's important to match your skin tone (I have olive skin I have been told) but other than this I have no idea where to begin.

I have a job interview on Monday and would love to cover my dark circles for that.

Questions I have which I would be so grateful if you could help (I'm not really comfortable asking the ladies in my life ATM).

Can I go the makeup section of a shop and get someone to help? Will they help match skin color? Is there shops that only sell makeup? I really have no idea...

If I chicken out of going to the shop. What do I need to order from the Internet? Considering i have no equipment (ie no brushes etc) nothing....

How do apply the makeup to conceal under my eyes? Will it be noticable considering I will need allot and I only will be wearing it under my eyes?

Thanks in advance for your help :)

**edit**

Thanks so much everyone for your kind replies and helpful advice.
I'm just going to buy every product mentioned ( like ~$200 worth ) and spend some time analyzing the tutorials and advice to see what works best for me.

She wants to wear it, but she has a really hard time applying it with a pencil (she feels she has to push too hard).  She recently got a cream one but she can't apply it evenly and she's very unhappy with it.  She also hates how hard it is to wash off at bedtime.  

I thought maybe I could try to get her something she'd be comfortable with, as this is something that bothers her semi-frequently.  Should I get her something like [this](http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P35082), as advised in another thread, or will that be too hard for her to wash off?
Also, should I get her black eyeliner?  I have no idea!  Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/B5XQM.jpg) to give an idea of her complexion/hair.

So I figure that since I'm stuck with them, and they really bother me appearance wise, I might as well try to hide them. Any suggestions on what to use that won't cake, crease, or look obvious? 

More info: the dark spot isn't directly under my eye; it's like a wide sliver that runs a little lower. It's purple/dark bluish. I've done some searching before and am considering using the Bobby Brown creamy concealer.. would that work? Will I need additional eye creams or something?

Minerals (bad, BAD idea!) Afterglow, Physicians Formula.  Forget stuff like NARS or MAC, they cause actual burns.  I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on makeup in the last 15 years trying products, then new formulations of products, and nothing is kind to my skin.

I'm not able to wear makeup and I have been going to job interviews without any on, which I'm am personally fine with, but it's been commented on more than once that I didn't ""Polish Up"" any (I'm groomed as much as possible, eyebrows and hair are neat, I use a little olive oil to moisturize, I eat very strictly and exercise to keep my face clear. But apparently without makeup I'm just a slob that puts no effort in?)  

Nobody seems to understand I get burns, rashes and hives.  

At one interview I got so pissed off at one woman getting so high-and-mighty about how I couldn't possibly be THAT sensitive (she would not let my lack of makeup go without a lecture) that I pulled out a physicians formula compact I had in my purse and applied powder to half of my face.  She got the pleasure of sitting there watching me break out into hives fairly quickly.  She was horrified and apologized, I just glared and walked out then straight to a fast food joint to wash my face in the bathroom.  Unprofessional, but people just don't get it.

Is there any makeup out there that is truly and purely organic?  Even the organic stuff I find has titanium dioxide in it, and it is nasty on my skin.  I'm sorry if this seems a bit scattered, but I'm really upset and at my wits end here.

Hello /r/makeup. I'm at the point where I want to fix my biggest confidence issue, my black eyes. 

http://i.imgur.com/ukNTZWu.jpg (It's not very visible in photos, much worse in person)


When I was young I ran into a piece of metal giving me permanent black eyes that never healed properly. I have people come up to me and ask me who hit me out of them being worried I was in a fight. It bothers me a lot, and I think I may resort to makeup to try to cover it up. I want to be able to buy whatever I need online (Amazon preferably), as I do not want to go to a store for it.

Can someone please help me figure out what I need? I don't know a THING about make-up other than where lipstick goes... so I am all ears here.

I'm only wanting to cover up my eye region, I don't want to expand much further as I want something relatively simple and quick I can every morning. I want it to look natural and hard for people to tell (I guess that's the goal for everyone, though...), I'm not worried about it running off on people or anything like that

Either I washout or the make up is too dark. Either too much eyeliner or too little. I need help! I do not have anything available to post my picture right now so I will describe as well as I can! As I said before, I am pale. I mean I am so clear that I am slightly pink. (My mom and sister have rosacea so maybe I might be developing that, who knows really) My skin is also bipolar, meaning one day it is oily, and other days I use lotion on the upper part of my cheeks because its all flaky. My eyes are green, if that helps, and I also have slight dark circles under them. I have also been told that I have a square shaped face and I don't touch my eyebrows. After you screw with those you have to keep up with them otherwise you grow a forest one your face. Nope. A friend sent me some Mary Kay Fair skin tone color charts, but I am so new to this that it is kind of overwhelming. Even if someone can send me to another site that shows some ideas would be great! I want to look nice, not like a trashy schoolgirl on a bender.

I guess I am really looking for a way to develop that ""no makeup"" look. It would also be nice to have a basis for making a finished look for things like a date night or doing my own make up for a wedding. Basically one really fancy, and one that is doable for work/everyday. "	t5_2qrwc	True

I just want something different, but no one in my circle is really a makeup person.  Help?

However, I wear makeup maybe once every other month, max. I've got time to practice, but I need advice on what to buy. 

Here's what I currently have: mascara (waterproof and regular), about a dozen shades of eye shadow, powder foundation, under-eye circle covering thing, lip gloss, lip stick, shitty eyeliner. I think that's it. I need to get better waterproof mascara and eyeliner, since the former doesn't do anything and the later rubs off in 10 minutes.

Note: I'm very, very pale. And I've noticed I look best in peachy/gold shades of eye shadow and lipstick. Also I have blue eyes and freckles, if that matters."	t5_2qrwc	True

I can't remember the name of the two pack for certain....I wanna say it was called The Promise, but I could be wrong. I was going to wear my red Shiseido lipstick but just as soon as I'd found the tube (which had gone missing for months) I lost it again :'( 

Anyways, here's pics. Please ignore the fact that I probably look exhausted. I have horrible insomnia, I didn't get home until 1230am, I was so busy I forgot to take my meds, etc etc, so other than a brief hour and a half to two hour nap at my boyfriends house around 4pm, I haven't slept. :/

Where my skin is dry - my foundation (liquid or powder) will stay put until I wash it away. However, where my skin is oily - nothing will stick more than 3 or 4 hours. This includes my eyelids.

It's incredibly frustrating for me to spend the time to apply my cosmetics properly, only to look like a shiny raccoon by lunch. Lately, I've been dealing with this by only wearing foundation, blush, and waterproof mascara every day. I have oodles of beautiful eyeshadows and other fun stuff...but I have to save those for when I go out.

I've TRIED primers - from the super cheap (e.l.f.) to not-that-expensive (Prime Time.) Prime Time helped a tiny bit, but not enough to justify the extra expense. I haven't tried the expensive ones (Too Faced, Lorac etc...) because they're pretty much out of my budget.  Don't get me wrong, if it worked well enough to keep my face together for a full workday, I'd pay for it. I just don't want to spend $15-$25 for something that is just kind of meh.

I *know* I'm not unique, and that there are plenty of combo-skinned pretties out there who can keep your makeup on all day. So, what's the trick? What's your sorcery? What are you doing that I'm not?

2) I'm very pale will red cheeks/nose and dark circles under my eyes so to try to cover that all up, I have to use alot of foundation, concealer and powder to try to cover up but that makes my face look cakey and not natural and glowing?

Hey reddit. I need your help. My entire life I have wondered why my eyemakeup would make me look worse rather than better. I know I am not very attractive, but something still felt wrong. 

I recently had the realization that my eyes are deep-set and slant downward at the ends (like katie holmes or Marylin Monroe), which is why none of the makeup tutorials I tried to follow in my youth worked out for me, as they were all made for people with almond shaped eyes that don't slant down.

**I desperately need makeup advice for my eyes.** How do I apply makeup for this type of eyeshape? What colors would look best on my eyes?

I included a closeup of my eyes with no makeup on the right eye, and some eyeliner on the left. I currently use just eyeliner/mascara and make it curve up near the end of my eye to counteract the down-slanting. I am scared to use eyeshadow because I don't know what to do with it and it usually makes my eyes look heavy lidded and baggy, especially when I put dark eyeshadows on my lid or in the crease. I also can't put dark colors or eyeliner under my eyes because it exaggerates the down-turned shape they have.

**Please, please help. ANY advice or tutorials are appreciated. If it helps, I have the Naked eyeshadow palette.**"	t5_2qrwc	True

I live in the UK so something I can possibly try out in store before I buy it. Obviously if anyone knows of a place I could get the Benefit one for cheap(er), I would be hugely grateful.

Reason I'm not going in store and asking is because I don't want to have a representative of one company try to talk me in to buying their product and not knowing about others that could be better. 

Any suggestions? Thanks a lot!"	t5_2qrwc	True

After a hiatus of a few years, I've only started wearing makeup again over the past couple of months or so. I have quite a pale complexion and green/grey, and tend to stick to greys, blacks and natural beiges for eyeshadow (all the ones I have atm are cream shadows), sometimes black liquid eyeliner on my lids, and plain lip balm. I've got a bit of cash spare, and rather than splashing out on a couple of nice, expensive items, I want to use it to try out new types of product, new colours and so on, so I've decided to blow some money on some ELF stuff as it's pretty cheap and I can get a decent amount of stuff to experiment with. Does anyone have any suggestion as to favourite products, favourite shades etc? Happy with any suggestions from nice natural colours to very crazy and out there ones, as long as it's not similar to stuff I've said I already use.

I also have a question. I'm okay-ish at putting makeup on my lid, but whenever I try to put anything under my eyes it makes them look like they droop down very weirdly. I try to put it right along my waterline/lash line, but it always goes wrong and it wonky, patchy, too thick, and it just doesn't look right. Any tips on how to improve this? I've been using a pencil eyeliner to try to do it, so not sure if I should try something else?

tl;dr I want to try exciting new makeup from ELF, please recommend me things, and please tell me how the heck to do nice undereye makeup."	t5_2qrwc	True

I'm 20/f, if that helps.

My daily makeup routine is a bit of eyeliner on the bottom eyelids, and some mascara on the top. If I'm really going all out, I'll add some eye shadow and foundation.

So, what should I use my $25 dollars on?

I don't know if it's a hormonal thing as I get older (I just turned 26), but my skin has become INCREDIBLY oily. I have to powder my face probably every 30 minutes ALL DAY to keep it from looking like a melty mess. I'm incredibly lucky to have virtually no acne, blackheads, etc. (thanks to Accutane several years ago).  

My routine is to use Neutrogena oil-free face wash everyday, use an astringent, cover my face in benzoyl peroxide cream, and I have been using Clinique super balanced foundation and double face powder everyday for years.

Any recommendations for how to reduce oil on my face is greatly appreciated. I'm open to suggestions on facial washes, lotions, potions, foundation, powders, etc. I also do not have sensitive skin if that helps.

Thanks!

I have been experimenting with different ways to stop my eyeliner from smudging onto the crease of my eyelid about halfway through the day.  I've tried different eyeliners and a few different eye primers.  What is frustrating is that one eye even smudges more than the other, my left eye.  I've tried a bunch of different products to help, with varying success but none that quite hit the mark. 

So far I've tried:

MAC Prep + Prime Eye - This felt so smooth and light going on, but barely helped my smudge problem at all, so I took it back and exchanged it for a Paint Pot instead.

MAC Paint Pot in Painterly - This has worked the best for me so far.  It takes the longest for any given eyeliner to smudge

Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion - This was okay but didn't work nearly as well as the MAC Paint Pot.  The same eyeliners smudged more and in a shorter amount of time

NARS  eyeliner in Black Moon - this only smudges a little bit and stays put fairly well, but it does still smudge

MAC eyeliner in Bordeauxline - This has been the best eyeliner and has smudged the least of all three that I have tried, but I still have the smudging issue

Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner in Perversion - I bought this one recently because I did a lot of research and read a ton of reviews saying this eyeliner stays put all day and never smudges.  However, it smudges the QUICKEST for me!  It has the deepest black, and I really like how the 24/7 line has so many great colors, so I was really hoping I could find a way to work this out.

My wife is of course a girly girl and loves doing makeup. Not being biased, she is extremely talented and gets a TON of compliments when we go out. We haven't always had the money to get her all the supplies and brands she dreams of, but now that is going to change. 

I came across a 193 piece Sephora makeup set on Amazon (i can provide a link if needed), which I assumed was a good deal since I think I remember her telling me Sephora was owned by OPI, one of her favorite brands... Is this a good kit? 

Also I need recommendations for a good, quality set of brushes for her. I wanted to buy her the MAC 5 piece set but it's like $70... I am your average clueless husband and I think this is honestly buying a brand... Would it be worth it to get her a MAC brush kit? What are some other options for a quality brush set?

TL;DR I want to buy my lovely wife a nice set of brushes, she has a lot of makeup but would love a full giant set like the Sephora kit. Money is not an option.

She is a truly wonderful woman and we have had a rough year full of cut backs and I want to treat her to one of her favorite things. Thank you everyone for your time!

Edit: HOLY CROW!! Thank you so much for all the fast answers!! I was planning on buying her a nice lighted mirror and stool for her vanity in addition to these things...

* Ok first question.  What are good, but not so expensive, brands of makeup?  My main concern is eyeshadow, linear, and mascara.  I just started a new job, it's a minimum wage job as a receptionist.  So my cash flow isn't going to be so great.


* Second.  What is office appropriate style should I wear?  Like color wise.  I've never worked in an office before.


* I also have a problem wearing foundation.  I touch my face a lot.  So I don't really wear any foundation, because I manage to wipe it off on accident.  However, I am open to advice though!


* Last problem, I have a really oily face (and hair if there's any advice on that I'll gladly take too).  How do I fix this?


As for my features/skin/hair.  I have light skin, but can get a few shades darker in the summer.  Naturally dark brown hair, I dye it to a really light brown.  Dark brown eyes that are just really small so I'm scared of using eyeliner on my upper lids because I feel they look smaller.

I got some great suggestions, went out and bought a few products, and am practicing my application skills. I'm really struggling with my lips, though.

I am VERY fair, and have some pink pigmentation that extends slightly beyond the edge of my lower lip. It's not that big of a deal when I'm not wearing anything on my lips, as it's just a shade or so lighter than my lips are, so it's not terribly obvious. Putting anything colored on my lips REALLY accentuates it, though -- if I keep the product on my lips alone, it looks like I've got lipstick smears or something, and if I try to ""expand"" my lip line a bit to incorporate the pigment bleed-over, my lower lip looks freakishly large.

I've done a bit of googling about the issue, and have seen concealer and foundation both recommended to cover up any initial color before lipstick application. I haven't seen any particular product brands/names mentioned, though. I'm using BB cream on my face rather than foundation, as it was suggested as a great lightweight option. It is, but it's also too light to cover up this much pink. Any suggestions on what specific product I should snag to use as a lip base? If there are other ways of resolving ""my lips don't know where they end"", that would also be great info to have. 

Sorry about the long explanation...much thanks to anyone who makes it through all of that."	t5_2qrwc	True

Is it the rinsing afterward? My first thought was that there might be residue left on the brushes from the conditioner.

My girls birthday is coming up. I nailed it last year with Urban Decay: Naked Palette and touche eclat. This year I'd like to get her something else but I'm on a serious budget. About £30 max.. as such I'm driving myself crazy thinking about what she'd like but can't come to any firm conclusions.

What do you think the best value for money makeup is? I'm not fussy if its concealer/foundation/an eyebrow pencil!

I really need makeup, but I don't want to spend a fortune because - *as the title explains* - I'm a beginner. Money isn't a huge concern, I'll have enough regardless. But I don't want to go kray.

**Question**: For a girl with *NO* makeup whatsoever, what do I need? And, more to point, what should I buy?!

Here's what I think I want:

* [*Maybelline Expert Eyeshadow Quad Natural Smokes*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Maybelline-Expert-Eyeshadow-Quad-Natural-Smokes-02?skuId=693736)

* [*Liquid Eyeliner*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Revlon-ColorStay-Liquid-Liner-All-Day-Wear-Blackest-Black-251?skuId=350354)

* [*Mascara*](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/CoverGirl-Queen-Lash-Fanatic-Mascara-Very-Black-Q100?skuId=869522)

But I also need foundation (*I have no idea what I'm looking for - other than the fact that I have regular skin tone*), primer, and something for contouring. Any eye-related purchases that I missed would also be appreciated! Oh, and what the heck is BB cream?

The problem is that I cannot tell if it looks good or terrible. It is probably related to Asperger's syndrome. I have trouble recognizing faces, reading expressions, noticing if someone did even something drastic to their appearance, or if I do notice, I often can't tell what's different. The same issue with my face. 

I think I have a decent facial structure, and pretty clear skin, but I can't really tell what other people would see as problems. I once went to get a haircut and had the lady go"" oh my god how have you been walking around with you hair color that uneven!!"" I couldn't tell what she was talking about, at all.

I have tried makeup in the past, but have done some apparently very wrong things. IE- Baby powder as face powder, eyeliner making my eyes look smaller, color matching to my skin very wrong or missed spots. That was in high school mostly, so maybe my adult eyes and brain will save me from some big mistakes, but **I am worried about looking like an idiot!**

Most of my friends are guys, or other non-makeup girls. My mom would make me look like... a mom. I don't know how to construct a look that is ""me"". Once I have that, I wont know how to make sure I execute it correctly.

The video gurus I could see being helpful once I knew which things I needed to do. Obviously the ""seductress eye blast"" is not the right video for me, but what is? I am ultra clueless.

Also, I have super sensitive skin and would like to know if any of the ""natural"" or ""organic"" brands are any good at all.

So to sum up, I'd like to learn how I can:

Know what I need to fix.
Find something that fits my personality.
**Know if I've done it right, or if I am scary looking!**

Help!

I'm into my alternative, indie music with a decent helping of eclectic electro and electroclash. I like to wear somewhat striking but casual clothes. I love to wear dark blacks with my bright yellow tigers or red high-tops, a metallic necklace thrown in. I guess I tend towards a darker look with a part of the outfit standing out in stark colour. I like to look good, at least what I think that means, and er, express myself as they say. I like people to be able to tell on first glance that I'm odd, that I'm on the edge of the bell curve and have something interesting to say. I tend to ride the boundary between intriguing and intimidating but too much the latter, keeping many a conversation at bay. I reckon make-up will help me better express my personality and style as well as help open myself to more people and great conversations.

I wear glasses, with an eye condition that prevents the use of contacts. I'm sure that isn't helpful when it comes to this stuff. I have longer hair, going on shoulder length right now. I like to rock some stubble or more often, a bit more growth than that. Apart from loving the look, I find it helps define my face and neck. I tend to have a brooding, unmoved appearance but become animated and warm when talking to others.

I used to wear a good deal of makeup in high school, but I've stopped wearing it completely the last few years. I wanted to go all out(well, all out to my standards), so I got Urban Decay Primer Potion- original, Urban Decay 24/7 Liquid Liner- Perversion(black), and Sephora Lip Stain- Pink. Everyone raved about Urban Decay for oily skin, which mine is. A lot. 

So far I'm in love with the lip stain. I took a swing at the primer potion and the liquid liner. I did ok for a first run, but my biggest issue is my lashes. I have light brown lashes and they stand out really weird against the jet black liner. I really hate mascara. Like, really hate, so I don't really want to go that route. Would I be better off with a brown liner? I really like the look of the jet black liner, but would give it up if the brown still looks good and disguises my lashes better. I'd be willing to try mascara again if someone knew of a really good light mascara that goes on really liquidy(not thick and clumpy) but still lasts. Suggestions?"	t5_2qrwc	True

These are the issues:

* Red rash like patches on cheeks with small bumps (I spoke to a dermatologist, he said very early signs of rosacha, didn't give me anything for it) 

* discolouration around mouth
* Dark circles under my eyes
* Large pores on forehead, upper cheeks and chin
*Small scars on the jawline area

My skin is both dry and oily. It is oily on the nose and forehead, and dry in the area right between my eyes and eyebrows :S

I use apricot scrub and a gel face wash.

My mother is not a make-up wearing woman and I was never shown how to apply make-up or anything so I have NO idea, but I am sick of going into work everyday looking like I was run over by a truck. But I would feel very uncomfortable made up too heavily (especially because I would hate for people to point it out too much that I am wearing make-up). 

I really don't have any tools or skills, so pretty much a blank canvas.

I've been searching for a good blush that looks natural on my pale skin that has NO shimmer in it, and I have not found one that I like at all.

A while ago I posted to [MakeupAddiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/ny4d1/whats_your_makeup_blog/) to create a subreddit specific listing but since the revamp we're trying to expand the group. We've now become [Eyeliners &amp; Lipsticks](http://eyelinersandlipsticks.blogspot.com) and we'd love for you to join us. 

If you're not familiar with a blog listing, it's basic intent is to string similar blogs together and hopefully drive traffic to individual blogs. So if you're listed already it would be highly appreciated if you provided a link back to the E&amp;L. :)"	t5_2qrwc	True

I headed over to sephora not expecting them to look like much but literally was floored, all the attendees had fantastic make up. They all looked like porcelain dolls.

I've watched YouTube videos.  I've tried propping my arm up on a counter while I apply it.  And it's awful--it's either not on the lash line (so there's some visible skin between the line and the lashes), or I feel like I'm poking myself in the eye, so my eyelids spasm and it goes on unevenly.

Do I really need base, bronzer, highlighter, blush, and 20 different pure-bred horse hair brushes to just start on my face alone (nevertheless lip stick, stain, gloss, and liner/ five different eye shadows). 

Also, do I need to spend $20+ per make up item at higher end stores like sephora and ulta? Does the price really make that much of a difference? I always wuss out whenever I see mascara getting into the two digit price-range, opting to fork over five bucks for a tube at the drug store (even spending that much makes me cringe a bit).  

Also, how often should I change out what I have in there? I always hear about how important it is to throw out makeup that's a few months old, but I find it super hard to throw out a little tube that cost me five bucks, let alone $20+

I'm a newbie to this here subreddit and I have a potentially silly question for you. Is the use of a green stick or green concealer considered the best way to camouflage red spots?

I had pretty bad acne as a teenage but thankfully the scarring wasn't too bad. The last several months, however, I've been suffering from adult acne so now I have a whole new slew of marks all over my face.

I use Vichy Dermablend liquid foundation with Setting FX loose powder, but I find I really have to pile on the Dermablend to cover my marks and even then, they're still kind of noticeable, almost purple compared to the rest of my skin. Over the course of the day, because I have pretty oily skin, the foundation starts to wear off in my most oily areas and it looks terrible.

So actually, in addition to the green question, I'd also like to know if anyone has any suggestions for a liquid foundation with the same kind of coverage as this one, as well as a setting powder? I'm pretty sure my oily skin is the main culprit and I'm upping my water intake in an effort to tone it down.

Cover FX was my best friend for many years so I tend to stick to their line, hence the Setting FX. I love the Vichy Dermablend except that it seems to wear off and looks blotchy about halfway through the day.



**tl;dr** - Is green cover-up the best way to camouflage red marks? What are some better setting powders than Setting FX?

That being said, I'm in a financial position to blow a decent amount of money on makeup and I really would like to find some stuff that is appropriate to my face. For years I've made due with little or no foundation, I'm afraid of blush, I just go with my standard day or evening look and don't do much else. 

I have oily but dry skin which has been the bane of my existance trying to find foundations.

I'm very pale, ginger, I wear blue contacts (brown eyes naturally, but since I needed a perscription I decided to play some).
I cannot stress how pale I am. I got frustrated at the MAC store in Carnaby Street because I tried every foundation they had in store and none of them were pale enough for me.

I'm considering dressing as an interpretation of Norse goddess Hel for Halloween. Because she is half undead, it would involve a lot of make-up (or something different?) to make my skin look dead in some places. I have experience as a visual artist in making things look (un)dead but I have no idea what materials to use on myself. I have eczema and very sensitive skin, so I've always avoided make-up to keep my skin from getting angry, but I'd really like to be able to do this costume. So, any advice? Thank you so much. :)	t5_2qrwc	True

Powder: [L'Oreal Translucide](http://www.drugstore.com/loreal-translucide-naturally-luminous-powder-light/qxp150560?catid=183557)

Concealer: [Neutrogena SkinClearing](http://www.drugstore.com/neutrogena-skinclearing-blemish-concealer-light-10/qxp232708?catid=183547) again. (I really like the SkinClearing formula; it's my favorite next to my regular Clinique stuff.)

Primer: [L'Oreal De-Crease](http://www.drugstore.com/loreal-de-crease-eye-shadow-base-de-crease-910/qxp179686?catid=183538&amp;fromsrch=l%27oreal+decrease). I've never used this, but it's the only drugstore primer I'm aware of besides e.l.f., whose products I hate.

Eyeshadow: [Wet n Wild Color Icon](http://www.drugstore.com/wet-n-wild-color-icon-collection-eyeshadow-set-comfort-zone-738/qxp347514?catid=183538). This is not your teenage-years Wet n Wild. I'd put it up against some of my high-end makeup, and at $5 it's an absolute steal.

Eyeliner: [Maybelline Lasting Drama](http://www.drugstore.com/maybelline-lasting-drama-by-eyestudio-gel-eyeliner-charcoal-954/qxp285144?catid=183537&amp;fromsrch=gel+eyeliner)

Mascara: [Max Factor 2000 Calorie](http://www.drugstore.com/max-factor-2000-calorie-mascara-black-brown-103/qxp159245?catid=183541)

Blush: [Physician's Formula Powder Palette Blush](http://www.drugstore.com/physicians-formula-powder-palette-blush-blushing-nude/qxp146266?catid=183545). This is another one I haven't tried, but I like the idea of blending the colors to get the perfect shade.

Lips: [Revlon ColorStay Soft &amp; Smooth](http://www.drugstore.com/revlon-colorstay-soft-and-smooth-lipcolor-fabulous-fig-325/qxp197246?catid=183590). This would be the biggest sacrifice for me. I never buy drugstore lipstick. Never, ever, ever. In fact, I might go for the natural look and just swipe some Vaseline over my lips.

(Disclaimer: I don't work for drugstore.com. In fact, I've never even ordered anything from there. I just got everything from one site for simplicity's sake.)

At first, I thought that it was the cheap make-up [I use a £1.99 tinted moisturiser for daily use], and so bought more make-up. I switched from sponges to a brush, and it seemed to fix it for a while.

Now, it's only when I use Rimmel's True Match that it actually stays put, but I don't like using it during the day. I've tried various types of moisturiser, from the standard blue Nivea, to E45, to a special dry skin moisturiser, but nothing seems to work. Any advice would be appreciated.

I've tried various ""kiss-proof"" lipsticks and still found I have to touch-up my makeup all. goddamned. day. I hate that. I'm not the type to enjoy doing touch-ups. It already takes me A FREAKING HOUR in the morning to get my makeup right, I don't want to waste my breaks at work (or, in this case, at the anime convention!) constantly checking and fixing my makeup. I pretty much want to put it on and leave it alone.

Well, I finally found a lip color that works for me.. and it turns out, it's not lipstick at all!! CoverGirl Outlast, the color goes on like one of those cheap little Wet 'n' Wild glosses, then it has a clear coat ""sealer"" thingy.. and I swear on my life 12 hours later it was STILL THERE.. and this is after drinking tons of ramune, several bottles of water, munching on pocky, and generally not paying attention. The best part though was the next morning, HALF THE COLOR WAS **STILL** there. I seriously had to put in EFFORT to remove it. Totally in love. I'm definitely going to pick up some daily wear colors (as bright-ass red doesn't work for everyday, at least for me), now that I'm not having to fix it every time I take a sip of a drink. ^^

1365999365.0	1cdc2y	Covering White Eyelashes	BeABetterHumanBeing	2	0	5	"In a nutshell:

Some ('bout half) of my eyelashes are white, and I want to conceal them so that they're all the same color. I put on mascara occasionally, but...

* I have not discovered a method for getting all the way to the roots, and consequently it looks weird.

* Furthermore, my eyelashes are REALLY long as is (my #1 source of random comments/jealousy from women), and mascara was designed to lengthen, not color.

This is something that I really want to solve, because my white eyelashes are mostly on one eye, leading to a whole not-symmetric appearance that, beyond breaking the number 1 law of facial beauty, makes me hate the way I look in pictures (since I usually see myself in a mirror, where sides are switched). I honestly avoid looking at pictures/video of myself.

Additionally, I'm a guy, and we all know that makeup is gendered. Fortunately, I'm also gay, so that's not such a bad thing.

If any of you have advice / ideas / etc.., that'd be greatly appreciated. I would post pictures for reference except that I wore mascara yesterday, and it's only partially come off, and thus would neither be representative of me with nor without it on."	t5_2qrwc	True
