Estefania's father is well aware of Jimmy and Fiona's relationship and probably blames this for Jimmy not being there for Estefania when INS shows up. I can see him taking Jimmy permanently away from Fiona and making it impossible for him to contact her (hence throwing away the cell phone).

I can see him bringing him over to Estefania with eyes on them 24/7. Not because he likes Jimmy and wants to keep him alive, but maybe as a last ditch effort to prove that they're actually in a loving, committed relationship. Estefania's father has stated that keeping her in the states is extremely important so he might be implementing any tactic he can think of to try and get her back there.

If this is the case, we probably wont know until well into next season (people thinking he's dead and then he randomly appears again).

How about some more lines from my man Liam.  He has been killing it over the past couple of weeks.  Great to see his character start to get more of a role in this show.  And Carl was also fantastic in this episode in dealing with Liam as well in trying to get his new parents to avoid adopting them.

On to the meats and potatoes for this episode and I was hoping for a little more with the way it was all set up.  I thought it was a great opportunity to add some more drama with all of the kids being sent into different homes and being split up even if a few of them were still paired together.  Liam and Ian were able to get out of any kind of trouble in their group home, but I thought it would have been a perfect opportunity to make them face some real adversity together.  I think they missed the ball on it for this week, but the kids are still not out of the system yet and we may see those issues come into play in next weeks episode.

I think it was an incredibly well shot scene.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it was the first time we've seen someone enter the house from that angle.  Usually when someone enters or exits the house, the view is from the kitchen looking at the door.  I interpret that as a longing to escape the house and the life that accompanies it.  When Lip entered the house at the end of the finale, I interpreted that as him finally realizing that home is where he wanted to be.  We saw a lot of changes and development in Lip's character and I just thought this scene brought him full circle.  Well done, showtime...I can't wait until season 3.  	t5_2sctv	True

1365366935.0	1bvegd	(Spoilers) Figuring out the meaning of the episode titles.		21	5	10	"Hey guys. You may or may not remember, but last Sunday, I said I would do a thread where we could all figure out the meaning of the episode titles on Saturday. I didn't do it yesterday, because I figured more people would be here to get involved if it were on the day of the finale, so here goes! Also, I'll be doing the episode discussion for tonight's finale today. :D

Let's get started.

**S01E01 - Pilot**: The traditional name of a first episode of any new TV show. 

**S01E02 - Frank The Plank**: This was the episode where Frank woke up in Canada after Jimmy dropped him off there. I believe they referred to him as ""Frank The Plank"". If not, it's probably because he's a heavy sleeper.

**S01E03 - Aunt Ginger**: Self explanatory. This was the episode where Fiona found out about Frank burying Aunt Ginger, and they had to find someone from the nursing home V works at to pretend to be their Aunt Ginger.**

**S01E04 - Casey Casden**: I don't remember. That one's up to you guys.

**S01E05 - Three Boys**: Doctors were concerned about a lump on Frank's scrotum, and believed he might have had three balls. I think that's what it means anyway.

**S01E06 - Killer Carl**: The school Carl goes to (went to?) demanded to see his parents, because he was causing problems. Fiona tried to put it off, because she was concerned CPS would take the kids if they found out neither Frank nor Monica was doing very much for their children. Jimmy came in to save the day.

**S01E07 - Frank Gallagher: Loving Husband, Devoted Father**: THis was the episode where Frank faked his death to get out of paying [~~T-Bag and Galen~~] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dWvqzEs9E0/TWIl0-bZhxI/AAAAAAAACLk/x4bEarm03BI/s1600/shameless_1.7_013.jpg) a few people he owed money to, IIRC. This sounds like something that would be said at a funeral. 

**S01E08 - It's Time to Kill the Turtle**: This one's up to you guys.

**S01E09 - But At Last Came a Knock**: Maybe something to do with Monica turning up? That's about all I got. 

**S01E10 - Nana Gallagher Had an Affair**: This was the episode where they found out that Ian wasn't Frank's son. Frank said something along the lines of ""Nana Gallagher Had an Affair"", so that's probably why it was chosen as the episode title.

**S01E11 - Daddyz Girl**: I'm pretty sure that rings a bell when you read it. If not, it the username Karen had when she posted that video of her and Frank.

**S01E12 - Father Frank, Full of Grace**: Up to you guys. :)

**S02E01 - Summertime**: I think it's pretty self explanatory. It's summer, blah, blah, blah. 

**S02E02 - Summer Loving**: I don't know, really...

**S02E03 - I'll Light a Candle for You Every Day**: Frank wanted to get some woman's (they called her butter face) pension, and needed to marry her in order to do so. He promised to 'light a candle for you [her] every day', in order to keep her memory alive. He also promised to get a drink named after her.

**S02E04 - A Beautiful Mess**: Probably something about how that woman found out that Fiona fucked Craig Heisner (sp?), and how Karen announced her pregnancy at the end of the episode. Also, Debbie got a rash, and Lip tried to find out Jody's dirty secrets. 

**S02E05 - Father's Day**: Something about Lip being the father of Karen's baby, or so everyone assumed.

**S02E06 - Can I Have a Mother**: Frank's mother was released from prison, and came back to the Gallagher's house. Sheila also confronted her, causing Frank's mom to pull a gun.

**S02E07 - A Bottle of Jean Nate**: No idea.

**S02E08 - Parenthood**: No idea. 

**S02E09 - Hurricane Monica**: This was the episode where Monica came back into town to fuck shit up.

**S02E10 - A Great Cause**: I don't know.

**S02E11 - Just Like the Pilgrims Intended**: This was the episode where they celebrated Thanksgiving...and their Thanksgiving took a turn for the worst. Their mother, Monica slit her wrists, Karen gave birth to Hymie, who clearly wasn't Lip's, and had Down Syndrome. 

**S02E12 - Fiona Interrupted**: This one has haunted me for a while. I have never been able to figure out exactly what it means. I just remember Lip moving back home, Karen moving out, Jimmy having dinner with his parents and the Gallaghers, and Frank and Debbie breaking Monica out of the hospital.

**S03E01 - El Gran Canon**: Frank's new nickname. 

**S03E02 - The American Dream**: Fiona tried to live The American Dream by throwing a club party, and nearly made a profit. Lip tried to tell her that they're poor, they have always been poor, and always will be poor. 

**S03E03 - May I Trim Your Hedges?**: Lip offered to trim some woman's hedges (her name eludes me atm), in order to prove to Ian and the police that she hadn't changed, and that she hadn't fallen in love with the student she'd had sex with, as she claimed. 

**S03E04 - The Helpful Gallaghers**: Lip saving Mandy's brother, Molly? 

**S03E05 - The Sins of My Caretaker**: In this episode, Sheila took care of a nun, who was sworn to silence. Sheila began to express her concerns about her sex life to this nun, believing that she couldn't tell anyone anything about it, however, she discovered that the nun was writing a blog called ""The Sins of My Caretaker"", in which she gave a detailed account of everything Sheila had said to her.

**S03E06 - Cascading Failures**: Things took a turn for the worst in this episode. Fiona found out that Frank called CPS, Terry Milkovich found his son Mickey and Ian having sex, and Fiona had to quit her job. 

**S03E07 - A Long Way From Home**: No idea. 

**S03E08 - Where There's a Will**: The Gallaghers battled their cousin, Patrick ""Pit Bull"" Gallagher for ownership of the house. And eventually they won. Go Debbie!

**S03E09 - Frank the Plumber**: Earlier on in the season, Lip explained to Carl that when two men have sex, it's basically like one is plunging the other's toilet. I think this is when Frank started to claim he was gay.

**S03E10 - Civil Wrongs**: A play on ""Civil Rights"". Frank became the face of the Gay Rights Movement, but was doing it for all the wrong reasons.

**S03E11 - Order Room Service**: Frank and Carl bonded. Frank explained that when he was a kid, his father took him on a heist, and afterwards, they went to a hotel, ordered room service, and watched porn on the television. Frank got caught, and told Carl to celebrate, by telling him to 'order room service.'

**S03E12 - Survival of the Fittest**: Possibly something about how Frank is in the hospital, and how the doctors think he's going to die, IIRC. We'll know for sure tonight.

Well, /r/Shameless, these are the episode titles I've figured out, fill in the blanks. Or correct the ones you believe are wrong.

When I joined this subreddit, there was like 5 people in here. We've got 10x that now, and we have a new mod team (including myself) of 4 people that a) really love the show and b) want to make this subreddit a great place for fans to see, hear and talk about a truly unique television experience.

This is a great show, with a lot of great elements, phenomenal characters, portrayed by excellent actors. The issues are real, serious, gripping and hilarious. It's not white collar or blue collar, it's no collar. This is truly how some people live, and it's a great piece of work.

Now that I've got that out of the way, without further ado, your mod team is located on the sidebar, feel free to post in the main content and message us with any special requests. 

We've got a lot of exciting ideas for the subreddit and with just about 2 weeks to go until season 2's debut. So please, tell your friends, and recommend this subreddit. We'd love to have contests, giveaways and hopefully if we get large enough, a cast member to do an AMA (a la Masuka doing an AMA on r/dexter). 

Until then, happy drunken holidays to all!

1364263883.0	1b0ler	[spoiler] (/s Character discussion : 'Lip)	BTEUndeadMidget	18	2	46	I know as of the episode before last week everyone did not like Karen, and now with what happened with Mandy last weeks episode a lot of people were not so sure with Mandy. In your opinion do you think one or the other is better for 'Lip? IMHO I do not think either of them are good for 'Lip, Karen may we all know is a shit disturber and all and does not seem like she should be with 'Lip, and now with Mandy last episode, [spoiler] (/s hitting Karen with the car). Some may argue that Mandy is better for 'Lip because of trying to get him to go to college, but she just always will have that Malkovich feel to her. I have always thought of 'Lip to be the most level headed one of the Gallaghers, but with the drama of these past 2 weeks I think he will not keep that title forever. Any predictions, comments, and thoughts would be great. **EDIT : I cannot format spoilers worth shit**	t5_2sctv	True

[SPOILERS maybe?]	NiceTryRedditBot	16	4	35	Towards the end of Sunday's episode it felt like they kept focusing on his worried face a little too much.  And he was so quiet and not nearly as enthusiastic as the rest of the gang once Fiona had the kids back.  He just looked so stone faced.  What's that all about?  Is he worried because of his pseudo marriage and Fiona finding out?  He's been juggling that fine so far this season.  Is it still about his gay dad?  He seemed over that.  I'm just stuck on how the show ended with Steve's dead pan face and can't shake the feeling something is going to go down with him.  Anyone else?	t5_2sctv	True

Carl seems to have a lot of questions now too because of what Jimmy said and I don't think Ian really cares who finds out anymore.  I've never though Frank was a good dad, funny, but not on the #1 dad chart.  Ever since he found out about Ian though I've enjoyed his reaction and now after explaining things to Carl I think Frank has done at least one good thing.  

I especially like how this show doesn't downplay the fact Ian is gay but treats it as something normal and that no one in his family treats him any differently.  Good job on Mickey finally stepping up too.

One of the best shows I think on tv right now, for so many reasons."	t5_2sctv	True

This feels like a virtual eternity of course, since we all just want to know what happens next. With that said, the original UK version of Shameless is just as good as the US version and has 11 series (seasons). So, if you have never watched the original which spurred the creation of the US spinoff, then you should check it out. The original is set in manchester, england but, still has all of the main characters, although, the ages differ of some of the kids, as do some of their personality traits. Anyway, it is just as entertaining and funny, as well as keeps you on the edge of your seat, so watch it!	t5_2sctv	True

But then it showed up as positive.. and now I don't know what to think. I don't know if maybe she took someone else's piss, the baby belongs to someone else, or she just really didn't want Veronica in the bathroom.
But I mean, Carol didn't mind V being in the same room as her when Kev was having sex with her, so I can't see why letting V watch her pee on a stick was a big deal.

I have to say it was great, the casting and everything, fantastic. The drunken rants were gold, Fiona was totally lovable (as she should be), the brothers played off each other perfectly, it was really nicely done. 

The last episode was ""Holy Shit"" all over the place. Call me crazy but I've never seen a show take things that far. The ""ice fishing trip"" was heart wrenching. Hell the guy seeing the entire office watching the video hurt a lot too. To think it all started with an apple falling on the floor. 

The sex scene itself was, surreal. Hell the bathtub scene seemed so incredibly over the line, but duh, I loved it. I like most things about the show. 

It would be fun to psycho-analyze all the characters. 

So as for the UK show, I turned it on and was surprised to find it's basically the same. The characters, names, events...

I'm only 10 minutes in, but curious, am I going to be watching everything all over again? Will I eventually be moving into spoiler territory for season 2 USA? Is the nudity in the BBC show, or will I find it ""toned down"" from the Showtime version? 

I'll give the show a few episodes, but knowing where everything is going to go could ruin things, then knowing I'm potentially spoiling the (superior?) American version could be hard to stomach too. 

Also, 7 episode season 1 (UK), does that mean season 1 (USA) is season 1 and 2 from the UK version? That doesn't really work out because while season 1 UK has 7 episodes, season 2 has 10 plus a Christmas special. Unless they consolidated the 17 episodes down to 12, but I can't see that.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I went into episode 5 expecting at least some sort of explanation.

Obviously, eunuch isn't strictly from Game of Thrones or even most well-known on that, but given the first episode's quote, I'm wondering if there's going to be some sort of subtle reference to the Game of Thrones series in each episode of season 2. Eunuchs feature prominently throughout the series. One of the main characters is a eunuch.

Maybe I'm just mixing my two obsessions (that series and this show), but it'll be interesting to see if episode 3 continues the trend, or if it was just coincidence. Probably the latter, but you never know!

So I was planning on watching the UK series (I had watched the first episode before but decided that I liked the US version better) but can not manage to figure out where to continue. 

The seasons in the UK version have less episodes and it seems that the plot in s03 is totally different from the US version. 

So can you guys tell me if the plot changes in the US version after s01 and if that is not the case, where do I continue watching?"	t5_2sctv	True

V4nd	1	3	1	"the US version was up for free on a local site yesterday, I watched the pilot and loved it, however if they had included the first 5 minutes of ep2, I would not bother with a 2nd, if you remember, that's when the smaller girl grabs a frying pan trying to defend his dad after Steve gets in his face, I cringed, then some time later, when Fiona punches Steve, demands him gets her dad back from Canada, and Steve complies, I closed the window.

I liked pretty much anything in the pilot, except the BEAUtiful girl who grows up poor has to take care of everything and has low self-esteem cliche. but I can't stand the we're family shit, you know what you're a shit family.

so, does the later eps get less family-y, or is it completely not for me?"	t5_2sctv	True
