This is not only an attack to the musicians he's stealing from, this is an attack to every single musician on this community.

so remember how i said i went to comic-con this year? well even if you dont remember, i did. i made it my mission to pick up as much pony stuff as i possibly could in order to get you guys some awesome prizes for this contest. and as such we will be having a HUGE give away for this one! so i think we need to have a music making contest in order to help me get rid of this stuff.  
  
first, the rules  
  
* there is no theme this time, just make something awesome!
* submissions must be original work or an original remix
* submissions must be your own
* one submission per person please
* please use the [2000 subs] tag in your submissions so i know what is and isnt for the contest
* any genre is allowed  
* the deadline is Sunday the 29th of July
  
now, the prizes...  
  
this time we have enough stuff to have a second, first, and grand prize.  
  
the SECOND PLACE prize will be a t-shirt from welovefine  
  
the FIRST PLACE prize will be the comic-con exclusive Dr Hooves t-shirt and your choice of one of the large give-away swag bags or pony comic-con poster

the GRAND PRIZE will be a swag bag, a welovefine t-shirt, and something else... what was it...  
  
...  
  
...  
  
[](/derpyshock)oh yeah, [just the 2012 comic-con exclusive Derpy](http://i.imgur.com/cgsXC.jpg)  
  
if you have never entered anything into one of these contests before, i recommend that you enter this time. with so much at stake, there is a decent chance you could win something! im even thinking of doing an honorable mention prize for someone entering one of these contests for the first time.

AgonistAgent	44	2	11	"I don't care that artistic credit doesn't have a strict monetary value that you can quantify, telling the artist to just watch their work be rebranded and that they should take it and they are an attention whore if they protest is absolute selfishness.

And no, even if the artist released the track for free does not mean they are giving the rights away for free.

[Example 1. SuperMarioPony.](http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperMarioPony/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0)

All his songs as far as I can tell are stolen with links to mp3 downloader sites. [Prime example.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv_rujPxnHo) Psychgoth (Bagpipe Brony) is understandably unhappy with this.

[Example 2.](http://www.youtube.com/user/officialdjhoof/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid)DJ Hoof.

Prime example would be [his ripoff of ""Fallen""](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPtunes/comments/177z0g/youre_to_blame_feat_hellhoof/c839us4), attributed to a probably non-existent ""Hellhoof"".

I tried to find this without success, so I made it myself.

iTunes rips have 5.1 audio. Vocals are on the central channel.

I inverted the instrumental tracks to cancel out the residual instrumental that was lingering on the vocal tracks, so the vocal tracks are cleaner than if you were to download them yourself. It's not perfect but it's better than raw.

Just wanted all you musicians to know you are appreciated. I know r/mylittlepony can seem like a thankless place for musicians to post, but there are people who care. So, if you're ever getting discouraged by either your viewcounts, relative lack of karma, or stuff people say to you in comments here, on Youtube, on Soundcloud, etc., know that there are people who love that you do what you love.

1344565630.0	xz4a7	Huge brony music event on plug.dj	derpthebass	36	1	9	"**About plug**
So some of you might know, we have a FiM room on plug.dj. If you don't know, well I'll tell you a bit about it. plug.dj is a website that has certain rooms for certain categories of music. In each room, you can chat with users and play music via youtube. This site owns a room designed specifically for brony music and PMV's, hosted by Cosmic. The room is http://www.plug.dj/friendshipismagic/ for those of you interested, but now on to the point of this post.

**About the event**
Our room is going to be hosting an event in which we will have big musicians in the fandom play their music and possibly (I can't promise anything) give us a little preview of some of their works in progress. Also, lesser known artists will be allowed to showcase their music, for those of you here who would like to be part of this, just contact us at fimplugdjevent@gmail.com. We want this event to be really big and fun, and everyone is welcome . 

The event will held August 11, 2 PM Central Standard Time. And it will last until whenever everyone decides to leave .

For the event, only moderators in the room and the artists will be allowed to play music, this does not apply to any day after the event. You can, however, request a song and perhaps one of the mods will play it for you.

**Special feature**
plug.dj has a certain design for their normal rooms, however, our coder has designed a special layout for the event. It will be a Google Chrome extension, other browsers will not support it. The link to download it will be posted once he releases it, and it will customize the room to what he has designed.

**Advertisement**
Now, as for getting people to come, we'll need your help. If you would like to, please tell your friends or maybe post about it on facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or whatever social network you use. We are trying to get as many people as we can to come, and we hope it will turn out well.

We already have our moderators contacting EQD and some other well-known sites, so no need to go to them and ask as we already have that covered

1362201087.0	19ic2y	Hello, /r/mlptunes! I'm auctioning off a piece of MLP music history for charity to the LPU cause and I thought you might be interested in checking it out.	hiero_	36	1	4	"http://bronies.com/lpu/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=77

I had a contest several months ago in which the grand prize was this very item, a stencil paint of Vinyl Scratch with a record as the canvas, **autographed by Lauren Faust, Alex S, The Living Tombstone, Omnipony, Jackle App, Makkon, and Bronyfied.** While this one lacks the additional signature of Mic the Microphone that my contest's had, it is still, as one person called it, ""like a relic or something"". In case you're confused, I owned two of these but now I have one left, and this is it.

The auction ends tomorrow night (Saturday) at 11:59 PM PST - midnight, and I thought I'd spread it around a little more in case someone who hasn't seen it yet might be interested.

90% of the gains will be going toward the victims of the LPU event which left hundreds in massive debt last weekend either because it was a scam or the organizers were just terrible with their money. Some of these people were even stranded for a few days in Vegas without a way to return home due to no money. One story I read in particular left one person to stay at a homeless shelter while he waited three days for his cousin to fly down and take him home.

Anyways, maybe check it out, I thought at least someone here would probably be interested. Thanks for looking!"	t5_2snmd	True

I've never been into electronic music.  Like, at all.  I mean, the closest I've ever gotten to that is Pink Floyd's ""Any Colour You Like.""  That's about it.

Then, after having found MLP, I found AlexS, Woodentoaster, KeepOnRockinBrony, PinkiePieSwear, SoGreatAndPowerful (though the last two aren't electric, but still).  And I adore them.  It's basically all I listen to anymore.

Anyway, I love them.  I was excited today to find [Woodentoaster has a new mix.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWzq9mr6Ag0&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C4c69cd8VDvjVQa1PpcFM2_9AyhxiWjfSQ1YROHpHT_m660BFtxKs=)  I was listening to the first ten seconds and I was like ""Yeah!  This is awesome!""  Then I realized it wasn't pony and I basically lost all interest.  Haha.  Weird how that works.

I mean, I could probably explain it: it's kind of a communal thing.  Also, ponies make me happier than any other legal substance, so I guess integrating them with anything compounds my happiness with those things, too.  Just wondering if anyone else is the same."	t5_2snmd	True

1361274562.0	18tb16	My sorted, tagged, and albumized collection of all the songs and BGM in the show, plus some 8-bits.	Krashlandon	29	2	5	"**Read the [raw file list](http://pastebay.net/1183917). Download from [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B38kVwl13cntSDhYVWVham9hOHc/edit?usp=sharing)**

This is my collection of all the background music and songs for seasons 1, 2, and 3 of MLP-FIM.

[](/dj) [](/sp)

Organization: Each season has three discs. Disc 1 is primary songs (Ingram's stuff), disc 2 is BGM and incidentals (Anderson's stuff), and disc 4 (no disc 3) is instrumentals of primary songs. All songs are sorted in chronological order. Tags have been altered to reflect this, and to place each season in its own album with multiple discs. Display names are slightly different than the file names. A few extras have been added to disk 4, and the album art is Philomena, to be a little stealthier than normal. Everything is ready to be pulled directly into iTunes.

It's pretty big, but I've found that Google Drive is extremely fast, and doesn't have the problems inherent to torrents. I've been working on this gradually over the 7 months I've been a brony, so there is bound to be a sorting error or two. Let me know if you find any.

1352994181.0	138ret	Something I Have Noticed	cantrememberaccount	29	2	17	"Hey everyone, I've noticed something in my 5ish months of ponies (yes only 5ish months). I've noticed that in the pony music there is a major lack of a certain genre.  That genre my friends, is the blues.  I love messing around on my guitars and recently started recording some things.  I was wondering if you guys might be into some pony blues.  My only problem is that I am a terrible lyricist, I can't really write songs without them sounding cheesy.  I'm not much of a fan of instrumentals ""inspired by ponies"" so I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me out?"	t5_2snmd	True
1351746600.0	12fzx4	oh! hey look, a mod post... (sub rules and upcoming contest info)	frkygp	27	1	11	"oh yeah thats right, I help moderate this sub...  
  
So I've been noticing lately that some people are concerned about the rules of the sub and what exactly constitutes ""pony"" music and that the rules are a little ambiguous.   
  
Simple answer is that they were intended to be a little ambiguous.   
  
Music is a funny thing in that its inspiration can come from many different places. So I tried to keep the rules open to people who wanted to submit instrumentals, ambient, soundscapes,... happy-hard-death-electro-funk-regge-pop... whatever. Things that arent ""pony related"" on the surface.   
  
The point is that just because the song in question doesn't include a sound clip or lyrics that involve the show doesn't mean that it has nothing to do with pastel colored ponies. The producer could have gotten inspiration from the show or its surrounding community. Not to mention, that some people just might not *have* access to show clips and recording hardware but still want to make music.  
  
And yes, there may be people here who are trying to game the system by slapping a pony title on a track and adding some fan art as a background in order to get people to listen to their music. Is that a bad thing? Nope, they are just fellow fans want to share their music with the rest of this community.  
  
So dont worry, if something is REALLY not at all related to ponies, the other mods or I will spot it and remove it from the sub. But i do like just letting the community decide what is acceptable or not, so we let a lot of stuff through and just let what you guys upvote what you feel is relevant to the sub.  
  
if you have any questions or concerns feel free to PM me or one of the other mods.  
  
ok, enough with that.

There will always be someone better than you, someone who gets more attention, someone whose work is overrated, or someone who doesn't even write his/her own songs. But that doesn't matter, because if you try hard enough, there will always be at least one person who appreciates your work and your efforts. And that means, that as a musician, you have succeeded. You affected someone's life positively, and most likely, you made them happy or you made them smile. Now that's something to be proud of. So don't worry if only two people or thousands of them liked your work, because in the end, you made someone smile.

And that's the beauty of music."	t5_2snmd	True

""I'm starting a KickStarter program called ""Archie Origins"" for support from the brony community. It is hard times to keep maintaining and producing music for free and maintaining a living.I hope that I can continue making this music with the hopes that I will be recognized amongst the top brony musicians since ""Nobody Likes Me"". For that being said, I need your help.

I have unlocked 1 track.  When the kickstarter is ready to go, I will be posting a promotional video with links to help. There will be cool things for you guys if we hit our goals ""T-shirts, CD's, exclusive music, etc,""  It will all be labeled out through the program.  As we go through the kick starter and reach small goals, I will unlock old tracks, leading to the day of our main goal.  On this day all the exclusive tracks will be posted and the ""Archie Origins"" process will begin.  Stay tuned for a promotional video to help.""

First of all, I just wanted to see if anyone would be interested in a /r/mlpmusicschool. My proposal is that it would be a subreddit that teaches basic music theory and such through analysis of popular brony music. It would look at not only what chords and melody lines they made, but more importantly *why* they chose the things they did and how that affects the composition. 

[](/twipride ""Learning is fun!"") This is just something i have been thinking about recently that I think may be a good idea since I see the occasional post about wanting to learn how to make music, and I think that this could provide a means for them to learn in a small-subreddit-feel sort of way, where everybody is nice and helpful. I know nothing about setting up subreddits or moderating though, so it is just an idea pitch. (pun intended) I would be happy to contribute to analysis or music theory posts though.

**TL;DR:** would anyone be interested in a /r/mlpmusicschool?

----

[](/raritywhy ""Why do I have so much to say?!?!?!"") **Now, for the second part of this post.**

As some of you may know, I started a parody album project a few months ago. It was a parody of Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon album. 

I posted about it in the /r/mlplounge a few times, but it never even occurred to me to post it here.

[](/ajlie ""I promise, I'm almost done!"") So here are the previous posts to get you up to speed if you are interested.

[Post one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/wwvba/i_am_working_on_a_parody_album_of_pink_floyds/)

[Post two.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/x0z14/update_to_a_pony_parody_of_dark_side_of_the_moon/)

A quick rundown of what it is, and what I need.

* Name: Dark Mare In The Moon

* Wiki Page: [Found here](http://thedarkmareinthemoonalbum.wikia.com/wiki/The_Dark_Mare_In_The_Moon_Album_Wiki)

* Each song details one character from the show.

* We have lyrics in their rough stages for every song except for the last two. Those don't have any at the moment.

* The rough draft instrumentals are finished, but it would be preferable to have someone play a real saxophone and record drums using an actual drums kit. Other than that, the instrumental is pretty solidly finished.

* Most importantly: We need singers! If you have a decent voice at all, I can use you! I want to get a lot of people involved on this project!

[](/flutteryay ""yay"") I think that about covers everything I have to say. If you have comments, questions, think Fluttershy is best pony, need clarification, want to get involved, or want to tell me that I am an idiot, Feel free to do so!

They basically decided to have articles compiling all of those songs that wouldn't make it into their other music articles, now called ""Spotlight Music"". 

I personally find it good. It gives small artists the chance to grow slowly until they start getting featured on the ""Spotlight Music"" articles. At least that's what I hope will happen. It could also end up in the same artists being featured on those important articles and the unimportant/unpopular artists being featured in threads nobody really cares about anymore.

This station has been running for quite a few months already but just hasn't had any exposure. Mainly because I didn't want to advertise it until I had the site around it working / looking fine.

Anyway, it's time to start getting it properly running.

So, is there anyone that would like to join the staff for EQU radio and help keep the station archive up to date and running smoothly.

What would be required?

* Working with myself and a few others to keep it up to date
* Not sharing server details (security reasons obviously)
* Uploading songs with correct metadata to the server directly
* Taking submissions, correcting metadata then uploading OR
* Contacting artists for use of their portfolio then uploading that.

It is a fair amount of work yes but in the end you will have access to possibly one of the largest collections of Brony Music and will have helped to create one of the most diverse stations out there.

If you have any questions or want to know more, please PM me.

1362089478.0	19f8dq	New radio show! I'll be mixing only the newest in Pony EDM every Friday at 6PM EST.	mushrooshi	24	4	5	"Howdy y'all. This is Shroo from Luna Radio, and I'll be launching my weekly radio show this Friday at 6PM Eastern time on Luna Radio.


My show will feature smoothly mixing recent pony electronic music releases for an hour. Each week will have freshest new tracks in the fandom, the majority released in the past week since the previous episode, and the genres I play will be mostly progressive house, electro, and trance, with sprinkles of dubstep,drumstep, DnB, trap, french house, and other genres. If I find any upcoming new artists, I'll also be spotlighting them on the show.


I've been planning the format of the show for the past few weeks, and I am very excited to launch the show this friday! If you love pony EDM, you don't want to miss this show :D. If anyone is familiar with Protocol Radio with Nicky Romero, my show format will run pretty similar to his.

Our radio station has also merged with BronyRadio, so DJs Midgetbrony and Sleepypony will be on our network now! Sleepypony's schedule is still TBD, but Midgetbrony's got a trance set planned on Saturday!

The radio stream, latest information and updates, and the LR IRC channel can be found at http://lunaloves.us I'll also be setting up a podcast feed sometime.

So if you make pony music, but it doesn't get as much attention as it deserves, and you'd like me to use it in a mashup, POST IT HERE!

Or if you don't make music, but have some pony songs at need to be heard, post those too. And don't worry, I'll make mashups with popular pony music too, be it a pony song with some normal vocals or a normal song with some pony vocals.

*checks again*  
  
OMGWTFBBQ?! 1000 SUBS!  
  
well we did it folks, we hit the big 1k. the big 1 grand! the big kilo... (ok that one was a bit of a stretch)  
  
i love how this community is growing every day! we have artists here who have made a name for themselves in the community and so many more each day who are discovering a form of art that they may never have before. this culture thrives on the fan made content that YOU all make and support. and on that note, i think its time for a new contest!  
  
  
instead of the usual ""just do what you want"" type of contest, i thought i would give this one a bit more direction. so this contest will have a theme, and the theme is...  
  
**CELEBRATION!**  
  
so try to make a song that revolves around the idea of a celebration of sorts. any style of music is allowed in any format.  
  
**RULES**  
* be sure to use the [1000 contest] tag so i can easily find all the submissions  
* the music must be YOUR OWN CREATION. dont take credit for someone else's  
* you have until **April 14th** to submit your work  
  
once the clock strikes afternoon-ish on the 14th the contest is closed and the winner will be decided by the amount of upvotes they have. and because this is the big 1000 SUBS CONTEST there will be a GRAND PRIZE WINNER and a runner up winner. Grand Prize gets you a **pony themed t-shirt and some blind bag ponies**, the runner up will just get the blind bag ponies.  
  
so head out, make some music, and continue being the greatest community that any fandom has ever seen!"	t5_2snmd	True

1347803666.0	zyy9l	Post your pony playlist / most listened to songs!		18	0	40	"I have 292 pony songs, some of which I listen to daily: http://pastebin.com/7Va9rmBw

You can see that I'm a fan of Foozogz, AlexS, PinkiePieSwear, (Pony) Archie, and SoGreatandPowerful.

What tracks do you all have? Which do you listen to the most?

Here's one way to share your playlist, from iTunes:

1. Group all your pony songs into a playlist (I do this with a Smart Playlist by tagging all pony songs with ""Pony"" under the [""grouping"" metadata field](http://imgur.com/QlKhu)). 

    (At this point, you can sort the pony playlist by play count, take a screenshot of iTunes, and post the screenshot to imgur. Or just manually write out your most-played songs as a comment. BUT if you want us to have more detail about your collection, follow the rest of the steps.)

2. Select the pony playlist, and then select `File &gt; Library &gt; Export Playlist...`

3. Export the playlist as a plain text file.

4. Open the plain text file in an spreadsheet application that understands tab separated values, such as Excel, Apple Numbers, OpenOffice Calc, etc. 

5. Use Excel to delete all columns except for ""Name"", ""Artist"", and ""Count"". 

6. Use your spreadsheet application to sort the ""Count"" column by descending values.

7. Export the cleaned-up spreadsheet to a CSV (comma separated value) file.

8. (Optional) [Replace all the commas](http://imgur.com/Ngtos) in the CSV file with forward slashes ""/"" to make the data easier for us read. (In VIM, the command would be `:%s/,/\ \/\ /g`)

9. Copy and paste the resulting playlist to http://pastebin.com 

10. Share the playlist here! Simple! "	t5_2snmd	True

Especially when other perfectly good music by wonderful musicians could otherwise be recognized here instead, which would be my ultimate preference. I'm not asking you to not post our teasers here, I just would rather other perfectly good work be posted instead since all of the Balloon Party content can be found in the one thread alternatively.

So I've been around the MLP music scene for a while, collecting music and such. I've noticed that a lot of it isn't very organized, or doesn't come through consistent channels. Furthermore, not all of it is good, and the stuff that's ""good"" may not actually be worth listening to. Even things like the MLP Music Archive have a lot of questionable-quality music in there. So I've gone through everything I've ever heard, and sorted it into what's worth keeping.

I decided to release this as one big torrent. Furthermore, I wanted to keep it updated, so I made a site where you can get updates every week on what music I've added. 

You can find all that here: http://thatmusicbrony.tumblr.com/

I'll release a .rar update pack alongside a conglomerate .torrent file every Saturday, so if you're interested in receiving updates, you can subscribe or whatever it is you do with tumblr. 

Also, I know this is for from complete, so if there's a song you think is missing, something that's in there that you think shouldn't be, or something tagged incorrectly, you can send me a message on Tumblr, or email me at ThatMusicBrony@mit.edu

Huge thanks to everypony behind the MLP Music Archive, I wouldn't have a lot of my music if it weren't for you."	t5_2snmd	True

Here are some questions if you want to fill in your answers! I know many of these have been asked thousands of times, but I'd love to be able to quote some of you on the air.

1. Why do you watch My Little Pony?

2. What does being a brony mean to you?

3. Why do you think the fandom has flourished in the way it has?

4. Why does MLP have such a large music culture in comparison to other fandoms?

5. Why do you listen to MLP fan music?

The show will be from 1-3 PM PST on Monday.

PS: If I remember correctly there was a contest for dubstep and one pony musician passed skrillex or something like that. Any hope to find that page + the song?

EDIT: Thanks for the so many recommendations. Made a youtube playlist with songs that I liked and I hope he'll put some of them. "	t5_2snmd	True

It's fantastic, perfectly executed, brilliantly thought out.

But s/he has no donate box, no feedback form, no tumblr*, no facebook, no nothing, and I really just want him/her to know how much I appreciate his/her music, how it helps me sleep and night and just overall makes me really happy.

All s/he has is a Youtube account, but I feel like messaging that account wouldn't actually reach him/her, as in I don't know if my message would even be read (if all else fails I guess I'll just do that as a last resort).


Anyone?  Thanks!

Classical Music.

There's a fair amount of piano covers in the community and (to me) that's great and all but I would honestly like to see more pieces influenced by the show.

So, why isn't there more traditional classical pieces within the fandom?

This is why I'm taking up a a small project of my own. I am a multi-intrumentalist specializing in classical piano. (I have also played Cello in my state's youth orchestra) But above all, Piano is pretty much my niche. (As a side note, in my college searches, I was accepted to Berklee but turned them down due to wanting to pursue a career as an educator) I would like to make an album of Piano-based classical music with pieces influenced by the show.

My question to **YOU** is, who would buy this album?"	t5_2snmd	True

Honestly, i wasn't sure what to do for a prize for when we hit the big 2k. However, you guys managed to time the eventual two thousandth subscriber the same time I am at COMIC-CON! So with that being said, all the prizes for the up coming contest will be either comic-con exclusive stuff or just comic-con themed items.  
  
I don't want to tell you guys what the prizes are just yet, but they are pretty awesome. I'm going to see if i can wrangle up some more stuff in the following days for future give-aways.  
    
  
I highly recommend that even if you have never submitted anything before, you start with this one. Because you may just win some pretty sweet swag.  

So in the mean time, start getting your creative juices flowing, and get ready for an awesome contest experience. More details will follow about the actual rules of the contest and the theme when we actually hit 2000 subs.  
  
Also if you are at Comic-Con and want to meet up at some point, let me know and we can have our own little /r/MLPtunes reddit meetup."	t5_2snmd	True

Balloon Party has kept me **super** busy and on my toes on a day to day basis. I just haven't had the time to rip the songs and upload them lately, but I **made** time for smile. I also treated the sound to uncompress and equalize it to sound more like the **Studio B original file**.

The kind of sound treatment you hear here, well, you can look forward to me applying this to *every single piece of soundtrack I have uploaded thus far, as well as future uploads*. But I don't know when I will get around to it, just know that I will~!

Or perhaps downvote it based on the person who made the music simply not liking the artist.

For this reason I believe this sub would benefit from having no downvotes, only upvotes.

What do you guys think?

Okay, so I found PinkiePieSwear again after years of thinking I would never hear those sweet, calming songs once more.

Now, I found I recall a variation on one of them. Flutterwonder was one of PPS's greatest hits, and there was a nice remix that featured an extended vocal piece.

It's kind of like Fluttershy was singing:

""I need. Yeah, I need.""

Or as the song would sing it:

""Iiiiiiiiihiiiiii neeeeeeeheeeed. Yeah Iiiiiiihiiiiiii neeeeeeeheeeed.""

I know that came across as very confusing. I can't remember the rest, but I swear it was a version of FlutterWonder.

Can anyone help? "	t5_2snmd	True

But now I'm so sick of the stupid song, I've passed on the actual mixing part to a friend (he's over here: http://www.youtube.com/user/MarioBros125253v1337?feature=watch) and I'm sticking just to find and catalogue them.

As the time I'm typing, I can confirm that there are AT LEAST 158 versions of BHG, and that's not including Mashups, Parodies, Nightcores (or any other ones where only speed is changed), and Peak Freak's Jazz cover and it's derivatives (due to legal complications).
Now, time for things I learnt:

BHG Fun Fact #1: There is, on YouTube (if you search for it) an unfinished precursor version of the song, with a completely different typography, that is very different from the one everyone is familiar with.

BHG Fun Fact #2: Mic the Mic was originally going to rap along to the original BHG, and while he was part way through making the lyrics, Tombstone released his version, and Mic decided to rewrite it for that instead. There's an unlisted video, if you look for it, of that WIP.

So yeah, this thing is coming sometime soon. In time, you will all know how I am feeling right now...

Here's a theatrical, live-action video I made to promote the upcoming mix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61KKJUDryxo

&gt;Why? There are already thousands of those! 

I've tried to assemble a brony music group back in May/June, and that failed by August because I knew nothing about music at that time, and lack of proper equipment.

I was wondering if anyone was interested to join an electronic group (electro, synthpop, dubstep, house, anything electronic, etc)

I'll probably need 3-4 more people, and as long as you have a (decent, sorry no Mixcraft or Reaper, and Reaper is a no just because it has no built in synths) DAW that can export MIDI files, and you have a decent amount of time on hand.

***Previous experience with electronic music is not needed, but very much recommended.***

If you can play an instrument, like guitar or piano, and can record them as well as still do electronic-esqe stuff, that's also pretty cool.

If you're interested, either PM me or add me on Skype: eliteblacktech

The amount of I's starting out sentences disturbs me.
