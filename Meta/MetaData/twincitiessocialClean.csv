At the Minnehaha Park lightrail station, I observed a woman, presumed 35, strip down and get on the lightrail, but then was coerced by a presumed father figure, presumed 40 (had presumed 10 year old with him), to put her clothes back on. He offered her his coat. It was... Touching.

1326941031.0	omllu	Senator Amy Klobuchar voted for the NDAA and is co-sponsoring PIPA.  She's up for reelection this year.  r/TCS, what can we do to defeat her in the primary or general election?	kleib323	146	16	88	"EDIT: I'm seeing a number of posts in here saying, ""well yeah, she voted to censor the internet and indefinitely detain American citizens, but you need to consider all the good she's done"".  If you'd like to give me some specific examples (that would somehow outweigh Amy's desire to shred the Constitution), I'm all ears.

But now that Wikipedia is back up, here's a few more tidbits about her:

*Klobuchar opposed President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq in January 2007.[12] In May 2007, after president Bush vetoed a bill (which Klobuchar voted for) that would fund the troops but would impose time limits on the Iraq War, and supporters failed to garner enough congressional votes to override his veto, Klobuchar voted for additional funding for Iraq without such time limits

*Klobuchar opposes free trade agreements that some perceive to cause a loss of jobs in the U.S. However, she has wavered on her opposition to such trade agreements since her election. A current trade agreement with Peru may achieve her support on grounds of expanded labor and environmental protections, even though they contain the same language as past trade agreements.

*In 2011, Klobuchar introduced the Commercial Felony Streaming Act (note: this is a different bill than SOPA/PIPA), a bill that would make unauthorized streaming of copyrighted material for the purpose of ""commercial advantage or personal financial gain"" a felony under current law. Backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and praised by industry groups, the legislation has been enormously unpopular among critics who believe it would apply to those who stream or post videos of copyrighted content (videogames, TV shows, music) on public sites such as YouTube.  Justin Bieber has on radio called for Klobuchar to be ""locked up"" for supporting a bill that would make ""unauthorized web streaming of copyrighted material a felony"".

1317422970.0	kwz1z	Re: The 17-year-old who stayed at MCAD last night.	LetterBoxx	136	16	17	"After seeing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/kvvb7/17_need_a_place_to_sleep/) thread last night, I gave the OP directions to a couch he could sleep on for a few hours. I know there was some discourse in the original thread about him being a troubled teen who needed some perspective. I'm definitely not saying that's not true, but I wanted to let everyone know what happened after the thread.

After I sent him the info, he followed up to ask me what time he should clear out in the morning (unfortunately I had already gone to sleep, so didn't answer him). Then later, he sent me another PM to let me know he had left at 5am so as not to disturb anyone. I thought that demonstrated a level of respect well beyond a lot of people I know.

I got to school about 9 this morning and was the first one to the lounge where he had stayed. I came in to find that he had not only [""made the bed""](http://i.imgur.com/FKqCp.jpg), but he had also written a [note](http://i.imgur.com/yVfaI.jpg) on the whiteboard. It reads:

""Dear Gentleman/Lady of Reddit:
I greatly appreciate your kindness in allowing me to stay here. It means the world to me, I really can't thank you enough. You guys have an awesome studio, but your couch is way too small.

-Johnadams612
AKA Sam

P.S: I think I might have used up the rest of your marker. I left $ for a replacement.""

You can see the $10 taped to the board.

Sam, if you read this, go home. Hug your mother. You're young, but you clearly have your head on your shoulders. You'll be fine as long as you use it. There are kids who don't have the luxury of getting a warm bed again through just an apology. I have the $10 in my pocket, and I'll be donating it in your name to The Bridge youth shelter in Uptown.  Sleep tight tonight, hopefully back in your own bed."	t5_2r5mc	True

1325608478.0	o17zy	I was arrested outside of First Avenue/The Depot around 2:00 AM New Years Day and could use your help!	jordood	117	26	57	"My friends and I were leaving First Avenue following a wonderful night of dancing and celebration. One of my friends had a bit too much to drink and so two of my other friends were helping her while I went to find a taxi. For full disclosure, they are all females and I am a male.

They stood back by the building while I ventured towards the street to try and hail a cab. After about four minutes I wasn't having any luck, but continued to raise my hand in the air as cars came by. I was standing fairly close to the curb when a police officer came up to me from my blind spot, telling me I needed to get out of the street. I explained that I was trying to hail a cab and pointed to my feet, which were not even a foot away from the curb.

At that point the police officer seemed to snap and pushed me full force with both of his hands on my chest. I staggered backwards, now fully on the sidewalk and said ""Ok, I'm off the street...sorry,"" expecting that this would be the end of our interaction. He proceeded to push me 3-4 more times, with the same amount of force and didn't say a word. He pushed me until I was knocked down into a potted plant near the building side of the sidewalk. I had no idea what was going on and tried to continue walking backwards but then he took me around the chest and another officer grabbed my feet and they pushed me to the ground. I was then arrested and the rest of my story truly doesn't matter here.

I'm reaching out to r/twincitiessocial because my friends told me that they saw people with their cameras and phones out, either taking video or pictures of the incident. I realize it is a crazy stretch to think anyone who sees this will either be one of those people or know them, but it is worth it because if there is any evidence that the cop was behaving unjustly then it is far more likely I can have the arrest and the charges dropped from my record. So please, if you were around the Depot/First Ave at about 1:30-2:00 AM Sunday morning or know someone who was, I would greatly appreciate any help you can give me.

TL;DR: I was provoked by a police officer into arrest on NYE and I believe someone took video of the incident. I am trying to track down the video, for justice.

EDIT: As it turns out, I was closer to Seven.  Here was where I was hailing the cab, and you can see the plants I was pushed into in the back: http://tiny.cc/xxcju

If the MLBA wants to fight Surly AND kill repealing the Sunday liquor ban, I say we fight back! Let's organize, TCS!	grandeandy	103	12	67	"Surly wants to open a sweet new $20m brewery and create 150 jobs right here in the Twin Cities. It would be a destination, a brewery with a rooftop beer garden and restaurant. As a child, I grew up believing that you could aspire to do anything you want. But apparently you can't even build a brewery that has an attached restaurant. A brewery that would be a landmark. That would bolster the name of your city. And help it's economy. Why? Some assholes already have a business staked out and pay lobbyists to make sure the government gives them an unfair advantage at any cost. Who loses? Fans, consumers, beer brewers, and the people of Minnesota. It's time we stand up and say enough is enough, we're going to build something amazing right here, special interests be damned.

**What can we do?** Organize. Work *with* Surly. Contact the MLBA and show up at their offices in protest. Meet with our legislators and talk with them about this issue. Speak at committee hearings. Get more people involved and talk about the issue. Petition. Contact the media and write letters to local newspapers. Build a Facebook group. Make flyers.

**Why? And why *this* issue?** It's doable. A couple dozen TCSers can tip the scales on this one. And you don't need to quit your day job to help, just a few hours a week over the next couple of months. It's a great way to get involved in the political process and get some experience with the system. We'll take a stand against lobbyists. Fight for the freedom to do something amazing. And hopefully you can point to a shiny new brewery and say ""I helped make that happen.""

**What now?** Please, comment. Let's talk. Then let's get to work."	t5_2r5mc	True

I don't remember your name but I do remember you getting all nerdy when I mentioned something in your car. I have your GPS I would like to return it to you.

It was late May and you pulled onto the shoulder behind my car. I was parked on the side of the road because I was lost, out of gas, I couldn't find my credit card, and my phone was dead. Really bad night!! Anyway I was heading to Sanford Bemidji Medical to see my mother from Nebraska.

We talked for a good half-hour while I waited for a tow truck when you offered to go buy a gas can and fill up my tank for me. We jumped in your car - a super old blue Ford Escort I think? no exhaust, but you had a very lovely pair of subs in the back and fuzzy-seat covers that made me giggle - and went to Walmart to get a can. On that ride, I asked you what the ""extra-terrestrial thing sticker"" was on your dash, and you said it was a logo for a social news site. I inquired and you got kinda bashful and explained it to me. You mentioned ""there's a twin cities thing I'm pretty active in - sometimes for the wrong reason"". I found it I think and I hope to find you. 

Once we got gas in my tank you tried to explain to me how to get up there and instead you told me I could have your Garmin. You gave me your business card and contact information but I lost it. ):

This seems like a missed connections post... christ... Hopefully someone knows who this man is. He's short, brown hair, cute eyes, amazing sense of humor. He likes Pumas. I remember that too..

Now it's like the sex ads... oh god.

I would like to return the GPS to you. I will be passing through the area early next week. I would also like to thank you for what it did. It was the most genuine act I had seen out of a human being in my life. 

I will be coming back and checking on this page soon - I hope someone can point me in the right direction or knows who I am speaking of...

Minneapolis, thanks.
Through every fault of my own, I ended up staying longer in Minneapolis than intended, I cannot rue, nor lament the choice, the experience was incredible.
I had fantastic time, the literal best time. From Bocce, Baseball, vicious mechanical bull, going to a punk rock mecca on a hip-hop night, Electric Feetus, badly navigating straight lines, all the way through to...well everything else. I got my shenanigans, and certainly chicanary.
I was welcomed by everyone I met from reddit, and from everyone I spoke to from walking around the city. People were friendly, the places were welcoming, the city was (once again) fucking fantastic.
I got to play dumb tourist asked some ridiculous questions (why is the bat round? Cos the rule book says so. That's my favourite), I was able to be antagonistic and each time reasoned responses, genunine views, actual thoughts came back. With nary an exception I have been challenged, questioned with everything I threw out and then ultimately enlightened. Brilliant!
Without exception I have been at impressed, by kindness, politeness(That's right), and people actually being direct('Seriously some people think your a retard'), that is so rare in on tiny island, also conduct, and belief and the level of understanding in people wanted to convey. You all some smart muthafuckas.

But most of all thank you for the Friday night. The show I came to see was cancelled, and meeting up at the 'Burt Reyonlds/Ghost Of Roadhose Swayze' bar and hanging out was just fantastic (That word again!).

There was a post on a travllers curse(Can't find the link), essentially saying the more places you go to, you will find more specific things that you like. Thus you dilute the experience (observers bias), and are never particulary happy with anywhere you go. I have travelled a lot, and this adventure happily counters that rule.

LordNoob salutes.
P.S If anyone of you remarkable lot are heading to my end of the world, (That includes continental Europe too) PM me, find me on facebook whatever, it would be my total pleasure to pay it forward/ pay it back, or just have the chance to say 'hullo' again.

1312251995.0	j6aht	My time on the city bus.	AllTheDamnTime	77	13	125	"I could write a book.

Once a couple where cuddling in the back of the bus when the dudes girlfriend gets on the bus. Lots of screaming.

I spent about a 20 minute bus ride watching this bum. I was staring hardcore, he was so out of he didnt look up once. First He had 2 pairs of the tightest jeans ever on. Two. Tight as fuck. He also has on about 3 sweatshirts. He spent the bus ride taking ziplock bags out of his pocket and putting them in his suitcase. I couldnt see what was in them. Then, 5 minutes later, he takes the bags out of his suitcase and puts them back in his pocket. Then at the end of the ride its just me him and bus driver on the bus and he goes into the back corner of the bus and ties off. It was my stop so I never got to see the needle go in. As I got off the drive asked ""whats he doing back there?"" I responded with ""exactly what you think"" and got off.

This guy gets on the bus and stands up front like he's going to pay. Halfway to the next stop the bus driver realizes that he's not intending to pay and starts to pull over to kick him off. At this point guy starts yelling ""GO WE GOTTA GO, DONT STOP, WE GOTTA GO, GO MAN!"" this guy is clearly really high and the bus driver decides kicking him off is more hassle than its worth and starts driving. He then starts frantically turning in circles like he's trying to figure out where he is and starts yelling ""I AM FUCKED UP WOOOO, I AM FUCKED UP"" We get to the next stop and he does the ""dont stop"" thing again but the driver had people to pick up. So he pulls up and guy's still yelling. He opens the door the guy stops yelling and says ""Ok cool"" gets off the bus and does the whole turning in circles announcing how fucked up he is on the corner.

After listening to a couple argue for about 20 minutes, some father told his baby's mom ""Fuck both of y'all"" referring to her and his child. She starts kicking his ass. He said some fucked up shit to her, but he never touched her physically. Driver calls the cops, They get off the bus downtown where all the transit police hangout and get swarmed. They threw him in the squad, she starts claiming domestic violence.

I'm sitting in the front of the bus and this lady is really high or drunk, it was kind of hard to tell. She asks me for change so she can pay the bus driver. I'd already been on the bus with her for 10 minutes and she was holding a dollar and some change, looked like enough to pay for the bus, and the bus driver wasnt really hassling her. A guy gets on the bus with a bunch of roses, she asks him for some change and the guy says he doesnt have any to spare but gave her a rose to give to the bus driver as payment (he was kinda drunk too.) She takes the rose, breaks it in half, throws the flower on the ground and starts to chew on the stem."	t5_2r5mc	True
1309298289.0	ibpdi	Scam alert in Uptown	uptownadam	69	4	88	"Hey guys;

So, I just got taken in by a scam artist in Uptown (North end, near Lyndale and Franklin).  It's mildly scary, so I want everyone to to be aware and be safe out there.

I will preface this story with ""Yes, I know I'm a fuckin' idiot.  You don't need to tell me that.""  This is not a cry for sympathy, donations to the ""I was stupid"" fund, or anything like that, **this is just a PSA**.

I was idly surfing the 'net around midnight last night, when I hear someone knocking on my door.  It turns out to be an older black guy, grey shorts, ratty blue T-shirt, non-descript baseball cap, says he's ""Michael"".  He's got a sob story about how his car broke down on the 35-W offramp, and he's short on cash to pay the tow truck.  I'm not at my brightest at that time of night, and a few weeks back, the brake lines blew on my 24-year-old Japanese Shitbox while coming off an Interstate, so I'm sympathetic.  He convinces me to head over to a gas station ATM with him and loan him $60, and I let him use my cell phone to call some friends.  He's a good conversationalist, and when I mention that I'm unemployed with an engineering degree, he mentions that his wife works at Seagate (right up my alley), and that they're about to hire a bunch of people, and that he can probably get me an interview.  

He says he'll just wait at the gas station for his friends, and that he'll swing by tomorrow to pay me back and pick up my resume.  I go home, feeling like I did a good thing and feeling good about job prospects for the first time in months.

(Stupidity #1: Shouldn't have given him cash, should have stuck around waiting for ""friends"", and when they don't show, offered to drive him to the towing company/his house myself)

(yes, I'm an idiot)

Welp - He calls me up about half an hour later *(turns out that's why we wanted to use my cell phone, he wasn't calling friends, he was calling himself so he'd have my number)*; says his friends have showed up and he wants to pay me back right now, but all they have is a $100 bill and the gas station won't make change, do I have change?  Like an idiot, I say OK.  He shows back up at my apartment, alone; we make small talk, I make him a sandwich, and I pass him my resume.  I hand him $25 in change for the $100 (he was going to give me ""a little extra"" for helping him out).  All of a sudden, he gets real shifty, says he left the $100 in the car, and to wait here  *(This is when sirens belatedly start going off in my head)*.  I follow him out and stand in the doorway, and see him get into a car halfway down the block and drive away.

(Stupidity #2: gave him *more* $$$ to make change, the old ""advance fee"" scam.)

(Stupidity #3:  Didn't question why his friends showed up with a Benjamin, but no ATM card.)

This would be the end of it, yes?  Nope, this is where it gets kinda scary.

He has the audacity to CALL ME AGAIN just half an hour later.   He says the car has been impounded, and he needs *more cash* to get it out. ""$60?  No? How about $30?  Can you do $15?"" He's kinda slurring and sounds high.  

OK, I may be dumb, but not this dumb.  Even if I hadn't already realized I was being scammed, his story doesn't add up at all anymore.  He's already got $85 from me and supposedly $100 from ""friends"", and clearly has a cell phone to call people with.  

Also, he really seems to want me to meet him at the gas station, instead of coming to my apartment again.  While I'm rebuffing him, he mutters something to himself about how it's too bad that I'm unemployed and therefor home during the day.  OH SHIT.  I let this guy into my apartment - he's seen the laptop, TV, nice amp, etc - was he eyeballing the place when I let him in?

(Stupidity #4: Let a total stranger into my apartment at night and showed him around - he has eyes on exactly where all the good stuff is)

This morning, he called my about 15 times, which I did not answer.  He came and knocked on my door repeatedly at 8:30, and again at 10:00.  I finally answered one of his calls, and told him flat out that I knew he scammed me, and that I suspected that he was going to attempt to burglarize my apartment.  He *seems* to have gotten the message, but I'm still a little afraid to leave my stuff alone when I go out.

**TL;DR**

Older black guy, targets apartments at night with the lights on - will tell you a sob story involving needing cash; good conversationalist - will try to distract you by getting you talking.  Uses your cell phone to get your number so he can continue to milk your gullible ass for all it's worth.  Uses ""advance fee"" scams, and is possibly eying your apartment for future burglary.

Be safe out there;

What am I asking for? Gas money would be nice, not required. And you not throwing up in my car would be cool too. Want awesome tunes? Bring some (CD/DVD/USB), else we'll probably be listening to The Current or Skrillex.

Happy festivities, y'all.

These two seats will have a large impact on the Southwest discussion in the legislature next year because this area (Edina, Eden Prairie, West Bloomington) makes up a core service geography for the line.  
Southwest LRT is something that should happen, but elected officials need to support it.  If you live in one of these districts...

The young tan (possibly Latino) woman with black hair who was driving a white 4-door sedan confirmed she was going to pull off the road so we could exchange information, but then she took off as I turned to the right (which allowed her to get through the light). I thought I got her plate, UJR-974 or UJL-974, but the police said it was not registered. If you know who this individual is, please contact me or the police.

The police officer who responded to the scene said this is VERY common in our area and the courts do little to nothing to punish these people, often repeat offenders. He said he knows of several cases where individuals have 70-80 violations for not driving with license/insurance and are still on the road. In this particular case, I'll likely pay the $1,000 deductible out of pocket and may face premium increases over the next 3-5 years which could cost thousands more.

1298416459.0	fqme9	A word from a moderator regarding gun ownership, meetup safety, and throwaway accounts	Midwest_Product	47	6	123	"As some of you have seen, over the past several days a redditor has been using throwaway accounts to demand the banning from both this board and our meetups of those members of our community who happen to be gun owners (which, I should note up front, is a [significant portion of our little corner of reddit](http://grondin.imgur.com/twin_cities_social__shooting_meetup_20101016#CrXC4)).  Granted, this is a classic example of ""can't tell if trolling or just very dumb,"" but on the off chance that this person is actually being serious I would like to take a moment to address this issue and hopefully put it to rest.

First, our goal here is to be as welcoming as possible.  That means encouraging people from all ends of the political spectrum to post here and to attend our meetups.  Unfortunately, there are some people who are unable to handle being around those who do not share their political views, and although it is regrettable I believe they may simply wish to acknowledge that perhaps this board is not for them.  Obviously I would prefer if *every* redditor - including our mystery troll - felt comfortable participating in our events, but clearly that is not going to be possible in this case.  I am not willing to tell a large portion of our group they are not welcome because of one anonymous member's tinfoil hattery.

Second, the State of Minnesota acknowledges that its citizens have the right to own firearms, as well as the right to carry those firearms on their person (under certain circumstances).  Although redditors hosting meetups on their private property very naturally maintain complete discretion to allow or disallow firearms as they see fit, I believe any meetups held in public venues ought to conform to the laws of Minnesota, not the whims of those who fear anyone who does not share their political perspective.  If a redditor does not feel comfortable under those circumstances that is certainly unfortunate, but their grievance is ultimately with Minnesota (and the US Constitution) rather than with TCS or reddit.

Third, I believe this is intended to be a community of adults engaging each other in a reasonable manner.  Creating a throwaway account to toss around (*wholly unwarranted*) accusations of racism, homophobia, and bloodlust is not an acceptable means of raising a concern about the character of this board or its members.  Other mods [**edit:** and all members of the community] should weigh in here, but I am of the opinion that any future attempts to use a throwaway account to impugn the good name of this board or its members should be met with an outright ban*.  We welcome discussion, and even extreme disagreement, but it must be carried out in a straightforward and reasonable manner.  Wild accusations made anonymously are not acceptable.

*To be clear: any redditor who wishes to discuss meetup safety (or any other serious concern) is welcome to message the moderators, and they may do so anonymously if they feel it is necessary for reasons of privacy, safety, or discretion.  I have no desire whatsoever to prevent anyone from airing a legitimate grievance."	t5_2r5mc	True

The plan so far is for it to be hosted at my house in Uptown Minneapolis and all the fun will be starting at 5pm this Sunday.
We will be having a firefly marathon, while drinking surley and eating Thai food.

For the food I think I'm just going to get 2 large orders of probably Pad Thai and a Stir Fry from Chiang Mai Thai if there are enough people willing to help pay. 

For the drinks I also plan on providing some but I think it'll be more BYOB.

For the Firefly, I can stream it from Netflix but if those of you who mentioned projectors could bring one, it would be awesome.

Please RSVP either in the comments or by PMing me so I can know how many people are coming. I have a big area but not enough space for tons of people. Because of this I'll just be sending out my address the day before to those who have RSVP'd.

Please comment with any other suggestions you have!

Edit: I'm putting a cap on this. I'm going to limit it to 20 people for now.

I would also say it's a good idea to check to ensure that you have a spare tire that's properly inflated, a jack and lug wrench and also program a few tow truck #'s into your phone just in case.

Also consider space (thanks Aberrix) and your situation when deciding what's a necessity; it's only useful if you actually have it with you when it's needed.

Primarily, I'm planning on fixing up [this garden-box tub](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=38th+and+4th+Street,+Minneapolis,+Minnesota.&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=44.933977,-93.270128&amp;spn=0,0.016512&amp;sll=44.934130,-93.270124&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,176.82,,0,21.1&amp;cbll=44.93413,-93.270355&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=6gvAoAoelMGh3BK9ju5j7w) at the bus stop at E 38th St &amp; 4th Ave S.  I don't know whether it qualifies as ""guerrilla"" gardening or whatever, but I'll be damned if there aren't some marigolds or something in that box by next Monday.  

The basic story goes as follows: I was at the bus stop, saw a man clearing weeds, tilling soil, etc. in that tub, asked him what he was doing. He didn't speak English terribly well, but he told me ""Maybe, if I do this, someone will plant flowers here.""

So I am going to plant flowers there. I'm going to be in town this weekend until the 8th. I don't know exactly when I'll be going out there, probably Sunday the 7th. Not sure. Anyone who knows anything about gardening - guerrilla or otherwise - is welcome to come and make this corner a little less desolate. I was informed that this subreddit might want to know about it, so... yep.

Update 1: Looks like things have taken a turn for the worse, folks. [The planter is gone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j7b8s/challenge_completerrorre_kickass_flowerbed_guy/) I don't really know what to say besides [I'm sorry](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j6rth/kickass_flowerbed_guy/c29mdv4). 

The planter isn't there any more, but that doesn't mean we can't go planting things in some place that needs it. I just let that guy down, and it feels pretty awful. But nonetheless. We can plant the *hell* out of some flowers. We just need to figure out where and when now.

Update 2: I'm going to be moving about and trying to find somewhere to plant something on Sunday the 7th. I'll be around the neighborhood of 38th and Cedar, scouting things out, and then planting stuff that evening."	t5_2r5mc	True

Plisas	50	13	18	"So 7 years ago I moved to the US and got a super expensive out of state and out of country education just in time for the economy to crash. Since then I've been working terrible hours at low pay, so when I got a great job offer in my home country Norway, I had to take it. 

Problem is I like my husband and he likes me, and we don't like to be apart for too long. I have to move at the end of the month to start my new job, he has to stay here until we can sell our townhouse. We're giving a bunch of stuff to charity, and we're not looking to make a profit on the house, but we can't give it away either. So we're putting it up for sale at a realistic price, and throwing in all appliances and all the furniture the buyer would like (we do have some decent stuff). 

Sorry to post something like this here, but if reddit would like to spread the word and save our love we would &lt;3 you forever!

They are starting a new promotion next Wednesday, can a few of you join?  I'd love to see a few more redditors there.	gwarster	51	14	50	"Bargo rules at the bottom:

So one of my buddies has been tasked with setting up bingo at Maruso. Its a pretty cool restaurant downtown. Another buddy of mine wrote the menu and is the head chef. Nothing is over $12 (most around $5-7) and they're going to have lots of drink/food specials.

I know this seems like a shameless plug, but I've known this guy for a long time and I know he's good at what he does. Obviously downtown MPLS is very competitive and having a restaurant/bar that doesn't ~~gauge~~ gouge you is pretty rare. I'm just hoping we can have a good show of support for their first night.

So as far as the rules go, they aren't set in stone, but it will definitely be free to play. We are likely looking at free shots for the entire table of the winner for each round and a gift card for the winner. We can likely expect a bit more in the way of random prizes and other fun stuff.

If anyone has any questions, please PM me. Also, if you want to come, but don't have anyone to go with, PM me; my table is always looking for a new Redditor to join our ranks!

Hope to see you there!

Edit: The first night is Wednesday the 22nd.  Should start around 9.

The food is ""global street food"" themed. They've got a few latin dishes, some korean, some American, etc. Kinda hard to explain without seeing the menu. [The menu is online](http://marusompls.com/?page_id=18).

By the time i got there, there was already about 50 people in attendance. Over the course of the next hour, at least 100 additional people showed up. We all sat there, patiently, waiting for something to be said, or someone to let us know what's going on. Every 10-20 minutes after 8am (when we were suppose to start) a guy would come out of the door and yell at the crowd to get back. We did not like this. It continued for an hour. After 9 the crowed got pretty unruly. It's understandable considering we were just standing there for 2 hours (at this point) only to be yelled at, and not even told what's going on. At around 9:30 a kid grabbed the megaphone and decided to tell us, nobody will be accepted until 12:00. So, after almost 3 hours of waiting, no volunteers got to shovel. The only people we saw accepted were from temp agencies (20 max at my gate, maybe there were more at the other gate). By 9:30 there was at least 200+ people there. 

tl:dr all that happened was a lot of people showed up hungry for work, got treated like we were nothing, then told to fuck off.

Planning for this has been disorganized at best, so I am going to attempt to nail something down.  The general consensus seems to be that TCS has grown too large for another backyard party like last year, and that therefore an afternoon gathering in a public space would be our best option (possibly followed by some bar-hopping for those who are interested/of age, and perhaps a midnight showing of Rocky Horror for those who are serious troopers). The weather forecast is looking pretty good at the moment - 70s and sunny in the afternoon.

So, let's make it 2:00 PM on the south end of Lake Calhoun. I would encourage everyone to bring whatever food, games, beverages, and other recreational items they can. I won't actually be able to make it there until 3:00 or 3:30 due to family obligations, so I'm hoping one of the other moderators can step up and be there at 2:00, ideally with a big reddit banner like the one we had outside of grandeandy's place last year. I would also encourage anybody who has reddit paraphernalia to bring it along to help newcomers find us.

Please leave a comment if you can make it, and it would be fantastic if you could let us know if there's anything you're planning on bringing besides yourself.

Not much we can do about that now, but if you are hungry and feeling generous, stop by the Dandelion Kitchen food cart in front of the IDS on Nicolette mall and help these guys replenish their stolen tip money. It is healthy type food, good cookies and lemonade.      
**I apologize if this is an inappropriate post. I just felt like I needed to do some thing to help. If this is not an OK kind of thing to put in here, just post in comments and I will delete this post.**

I love eating at new places and would love to share my passion for food with the TCS community.

Concordia St Paul &amp; the Culture Brokers Foundation have teamed up to offer free $5 coupons for over 30 locally owned [businesses!](http://culturebrokersfoundation.org/WCHD) Just [request a voucher](http://culturebrokersfoundation.org/VoucherRequest) and we will send it to you in the mail.

Two great restaurants accepting the coupons:
Flamingo (Eating Rondo cuisine with your fingers is awesome)
Trieu Chau (I am a regular at this Pho house and love the prices)

**TL, DR**: Request a free $5 voucher which can be used at over 30 locally owned businesses. My goal is to give back to the community and help support the local ethnic food scene.

After you request the free world dollars, just make sure to spend it! 
**Note:** I do not benefit financially AT ALL for handing out these coupons and I am a student consultant for Concordia St Paul."	t5_2r5mc	True

The first one, someone got into the garage levels of my building and stole a bunch of bicycles including mine. I had it locked up with a kind of crappy cable lock, and they had all day to cut the lock.  So, I get a replacement.  I bought it on Sunday. I ride it to work yesterday, lock it up with a new 1"" braided steel cable lock, come back out after a hard day of work and it is gone. Apparently 1"" of braided steel cable doesn't even inconvenience a thief because they got it in broad daylight from the very busy intersection of Washington and Portland. I went to college in Flint, Michigan and Camden, New Jersey with never a stolen bike, but I get jacked twice in two weeks in nice, safe, Minneapolis.

So, my question is, how do I keep future bikes from being stolen?  I didn't use a U-lock, but I have heard that most of them aren't any better, is that true? Neither bike was particularly nice, flashy, or expensive either. I've heard advice that I should wrap my frame in duct tape to make it look crappy too, does that help? or will thieves see through that?  

The one silver lining, I bought the second bike with my American Express, and it appears that their purchase protection will reimburse me. So, kudos to Amex, and anal cancer to bike thieves.

The idea is to host a backyard BBQ event with a show to benefit the band so they can continue to record and tour. Of course it wouldn't be until spring or summer. Thinking of $10 or $15 a person and hopefully we could get about 50 folks from TCS to attend.

When I spoke to him on the phone, he told me that one of the women who worked for him had been in our store (I work at the Gap) and had been so impressed with my customer service skills that she had asked him to call me and see if I was interested in coming to work for his company. I was really busy so I told him I was keeping my options open and gave him my cell phone number and told him to call me tomorrow. The first sign that something was hinky was, of course, that he didn't tell me WHAT his company was.

So he called back this morning and left me a message, again, very vague, saying that he was looking forward to talking to me and I should call him back. His name is Keith. I googled the number he told me to call him back at and found that that phone number - 651-636-6407 - is associated with a pyramid scheme. Needless to say I will not be speaking with him again.

1292112541.0	eka4v	Let me tell you about my snow day.	biyomon	31	2	65	"Work was cancelled.  MetroTransit suspended service.  Hennepin stopped plowing.  

But I went for a walk this afternoon in the blowing snow, and I have never seen so many smiling, helpful people.  People digging strangers out of snowbanks.  People pushing stuck cars out of intersections.  

People shouting across the street to strangers, telling them that the busses aren't running anymore. People walking around with shovels, looking for folks who need help.  People just *walking*, giddy, huge grins on their faces as they navigate the waist-deep snowbanks and wave to others just like them.

There were a couple local businesses open, and I stopped in to chat with the folks there.  I talked with the guy at [Choo Choo Bob's Train Store](http://www.choochoobobs.com/):  

""How long are you here?""

""Oh, I dunno.  Six I guess.  We weren't supposed to be open at all, but I was already skiing over here when Bob called and said not to come in, so I figured...""

Dude *skied* to work today.  I bought a card from him.

Down the block, [Izzy's Ice Cream](http://www.izzysicecream.com/) was open.  Hennepin county can't keep up with plowing the snow, but Izzy's is still open, happily dishing ice cream to anyone brave enough to come get it.  I bought a sugar cone (cranberry sorbet and salt caramel), and the girl at the counter gave me a free half pint for braving the storm.  (She was excited about going to Doomtree; I hope she made it over there.)

They got the call when I was there, and closed at 5pm.

I ate my ice cream cone as I walked home.  About half a block away, a couple passed me on the sidewalk.  ""Are you eating *ice cream*?"" one asked.

I realised that I probably looked absurd.  ""Well, Izzy's was open,"" I said, embarrassed.  ""And I felt bad for them...""

""That's *awesome*,"" the woman said firmly.  She looked like she wanted to shake my hand.

Also, feel free to bring something to share (I'm hoping it will be a potluck kinda thing). Also, as someone pointed out, the movies change this week.

Hands down my favorite restaurant in the cities is Rinata on Hennepin between 24th and 25th. Probably been there 10 times and every single course we've had has been amazing. 

Recently went to Blackbird Cafe on 38th and Nicollet and that was outstanding as well. Small menu, locally sourced food. It's across from Shorty and Wags, which also serves phenomenal chicken wings, in a hole-in-the-wall type setting. Best burger would have to be the Paul Molitor with bacon at the Nook, but Matts is also a classic. The Market BBQ is also one of my favorite restaurants. Never had a bad meal there in my life, and their smoked chicken wings are to die for. Amazing ribs too.

The Blue Moon sandwich at Caffreys in uptown will turn your world upside down it's so good. Black Sheep Pizza and Pizza Nea make the best neapolitan style pizza in the city. If you disagree with me on that I will fight you.

Runyons downtown has great buffalo wings. I went to Parma in bloomington and was impressed. Same with the twin cities grill in the mall of america. I did not have high expectations but it turned out to be very good.

Chindian cafe has some great chinese food in Northeast. Origami or Fuji-Ya makes some great sushi. Wondrous Punch at Red Dragon is also a delicious cocktail that will floor you after 2-3.

Where do you guys like to go? Give me some 'must have' dishes across the cities. I want to find an outstanding Gyro. I also want to find more good chinese food. El Taco on Central makes great mexican food, but does anyone have suggestions for hole in the walls maybe on Lake? I've been to Boca Chica in Saint Paul and it was just meh for me. What about great places for pad thai?

Lets see what you guys can come up with!

Let's plan on it from the afternoon into the evening. I'm thinking something outdoors? Post your ideas and let's decide on what to do!


**UPDATE #1**
So it sounds like most of you are interested in some grilling and backyard games at my new house in South Minneapolis. Yay! Some additional thoughts and things to discuss:

* I live 4 blocks from the 38th Street light rail station, so once the sun goes down we can take the train downtown to the warehouse district and go bar hopping. How many of you would be interested in this?

* We can go BYOB or I can pick up a keg of beer if we can come to a consensus on which kind. I would only request that everyone chips in $5 to make this happen. Anyone interested? Suggestions?

* What kind of backyard games do you enjoy? Badminton was suggested. I also have a bocce ball set and can probably get my hands on ladder ball. Any favorites?

* Keep in mind that ""Rock the Garden"" is taking place this day. If you don't have tickets by now, you're in the clear. If you do, you can still meet up with us downtown after the show!"	t5_2r5mc	True

My old roommate had to suddenly leave and I can't afford rent on my own. I figured Reddit would be a good place to start looking for a roommie. Rent is $460 month plus electric and cable/internet. 

It's in Northeast Minneapolis just a few blocks North of where Hennepin and Central meet. It is a small apartment complex with only 4 apts (a quadplex?). Wood floors in the living room are one year old and the bedrooms have carpet (you get your own room!) It has a small AC unit in the living room that cools things down quick because of the smaller space. 

It's not tiny, but space is definitely sacrificed for a clean and up-kept living area. I've lived here a year and we haven't had to ask the Landlord to fix anything yet. He is a dedicated man who mows the lawn and always makes sure everything is going alright. There is a garage for storage or your car as well. And plenty of off street parking as well as two spots for the building residents only. 

On site Laundry (1.25 to wash 1.25 to dry)

I own a cat who is declawed and friendly to humans (not other cats, but we could give it a go maybe). Place comes with a 30'' TV or so and a Ps3 to play. Also a george forman grill, toaster oven, and a clean roommate. I'm not ocd, but I like to spend time each week keeping the place looking nice. I do my dishes and sometimes yours!

Any questions or interest please contact me ASAP.

The man told me that he had just run out of gas and asked me for help. I like to help people out so I started to agree and asked him where his car was. He told me his car was on Hiawatha but he was in a hurry because his wife was going into labor and he still needed to pick up his son. At this point I started to doubt his story. If his wife was actually going into labor he would be in panic but this guy was very calm, relaxed, and friendly. He would hail a cab or something to get to the hospital ASAP not walk up to a stranger in a strip mall parking lot several blocks away from where his car supposedly was. Then I remembered a similar post on TCS about a guy scamming people for gas money with a very similar story. Normally i'm a sucker for that kind of thing I've given people gas money and rides before but this time I said no. I wasn't rude or anything I just simply told him I didn't have any cash and couldn't help and went back to working on my own car. He didn't kick up a fuss or anything and he didn't go ask anyone else for help nearby me so i'm certain he was scamming me. Anyway I just wanted to say thanks!

Well you know who just tried that on me at my place. I like close to 2nd ave S and Franklin and he woke me out of a nap to give his tale of a car being broken down on the off ramp. He came at me saying he works in the area and has seen me bike around and he knows my neighbor so it all seems cool. He just needed like $40 to cover his tow fee, so not a large amount. I looked at him for a second and said, ""Have you ever heard of Reddit?"" He looked puzzled but said no. I told him I have no money and he walked away. I called the cops and they said they have been looking for him for a while and dispatched cars to my area. I just want to say thanks to uptownadam for telling his story here because I would not have heard about him and now he might get caught."	t5_2r5mc	True
1316649945.0	knbp8	MN Please help us find a home for this dog ... (Pics inside)	SaveAPit	31	6	18	"Repost from R/Animals

Hi Reddit-
I'm sorry if this is not the right place to post this, but I am running out of options. Here is the story last Friday (September 16th) my wife and I were on our way home when we came across a number of cars that were stopped oddly with their hazard lights on. We noticed that they were chasing a dog down the street. The dog jumped right in front of my car and began running down the road. I followed the dog slowly, flashing my headlights to alert oncoming traffic. after about a quarter mile, the dog became tired and laid down. I got out of my car and approached the dog, the dog let me pick him up and place him in my car. I drove back to where the people were chasing the dog only to find that they were gone.
I have called local shelters, and various organizations but I have not been able to locate the owners or a home for this dog. Both my wife and I love dogs, but right now with our work and life schedules (2 children) we do not have the time to truly take care of this animal, currently he is tied up in the back yard for 8-12 hrs a day and when winter comes I am not going to have anywhere to put him.
We are trying desperately to find this dog a good home. We have checked with friends and family but as of yet nobody has been able to take him yet.
Here are the dogs stats:
Breed: Appears to be a pitbull or pitbull mix Weight: 47 lbs Age: Approximately 1 year old Sex: Male Location: Minneapolis MN
He is VERY submissive and sweet, he has shown NO agression at all, When I brought him to the vet to check for a ""chip"" there were a number of cats around, he showed curiosity at most.
Here is a picture of the dog: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Am3UIE2UbJ8/TnoJnHwf-KI/AAAAAAAAARw/yi9zrZwUZYM/s640/photo.JPG

1315337927.0	k6q2s	Your Input Wanted in Regards to the Weekly Beer Meetup	ChristopherBurg	32	8	111	"OK here's the situation.  Since the beginning of the weekly beer meetup, with a few exceptions, we've alternated between Minneapolis and St. Paul on a weekly basis.  People seemed to be happy with this arrangement and everything was all hunky dory in the Land of Beer.

Of course nothing stays the same forever and now there is some discontent with the weekly alternating between cities.  Namely there are people who would like to see the frequency of switching cities changed by reducing the frequency we meet in St. Paul to once a month.

There are arguments for and against changing this police.  Our St. Paul meetups are almost always notably smaller than the Minneapolis ones.  Whereas the average Minneapolis meetup may have as many as 20 to 30 people in attendance the average St. Paul meetup is probably something more around 10 to 15.

On the other hand many people live either in or closer to St. Paul and thus favor having bi-weekly meetups in their area.  There are also a great deal of bars we've not yet explored in the capitol.  

So what I'm looking for is your input.  Most of the people who have mentioned wanting to stay in Minneapolis more often either live in or near Minneapolis.  I'm not one for changing polices based on a biased sample so I want to throw this discussion out for all members of twincitiesocial to participate in.  Anybody who wants to voice an opinion on the matter do so here and we can hash this out amongst the subreddit.

If you're for changing the frequency that we meet in St. Paul say so and explain why.  If you're against changing the frequency say so and explain why.  If you would prefer a completely different system be put into place outside of what has already been proposed say so and why.  Basically if you have any input whatsoever now is the time to speak out."	t5_2r5mc	True

On Thursday the 23rd, at about 9:30PM, a highly irresponsible dogsitter lost my miniature Italian Greyhound ([this little gal](http://i.imgur.com/Ge8y8.jpg)). She had Sam over at 420 Central Avenue in St. Paul, and decided it would be a great idea to yank her around by the collar, to which Sam responded by slipping out and running out the open door.

Before I brutally murder this idiot, I'd like to focus on finding my pup. I've let the Humane Society and Animal Control know, but the most success I'm having is through the posters I've set up around the area. I posted on Reddit in the /r/TwinCities sub, but I hadn't heard about this one until today. Minnesotan redditors have never once let me down, so I thought I'd let you kind folks know.

[Here's a map of the area she was lost, with each of the blue pins marking called-in sightings. Click a pin for a description.](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=209386198154265913575.0004c836420dec80b0f57&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=44.954534,-93.118057&amp;spn=0.032982,0.084543)

Her name is Sammy. People have seen her all over, but I could never get to her in time because they'd try to chase her, and she'd split. Which leads me to my main point: **If you see her, do NOT chase!** Her previous owner abused her, and she hates people she hasn't spent several days with. She'll run the second somebody starts moving at her.

Anyway guys, if you spot her, call me at (612) 859-1801 and try to follow at a distance to see where she heads. I'll be less than five minutes away. I'm from the Nokomis area of south Minneapolis, but I'll be biking from 6AM to 9PM all over that St. Paul midway square: between I-94, Minnehaha Avenue, Rice Street, and Lexington Avenue.

I won't have internet access, but if you want to give me an assist, shoot me a text or phone call. By the way, I fucking love you all. Let that be a factor in your decision.

Cheers, all!

We'll need to bring a couple grills, coolers with supplies, games, etc. To that end **I've [created a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkjOjPBuyxc7dC1ndU5rU0JXUFpsV3RjbXNZWDlMUUE) where y'all can list what you are able to bring.** I've added a few things that I will bring to share with everyone.

It would be great to get a good headcount, so if you plan on attending please sound off! I'm positive we will have a great turnout - with plenty of new folks, so if you've never come out to a meetup, don't worry about it! **This is going to be a ton of fun!**

Thoughts/ideas/etc.:

* Yes yes, dress warm, but more specifically, **dress like a *finalist***. The two most outlandish/amazingly dressed and styled of finalists will be selected and crowned. Everyone can either receive two upvotes to cast, or I can play judge. Your call.

* Will have two bonfires going, one in the snow fort and one just outside. I also have access to a propane heat lamp (thx Maggie!)

* Thinking everyone should bring a six or twelve pack and is only allowed one of the beers they bring so we can swap and dabble amongst the flavors. Or have an area dedicated to swapping for those that want to partake. Thoughts?

* Can fire up the grill if people want to do some outdoors cooking.

* Video games outside? Dave?

* Other games? Apples to Apples? Bean Bag Toss? Ladder Ball? 

* I'm flexible on time, but I figure 1pm is great. It's our year of firsts after all :)

[Amy Klobuchar](http://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/emailamy.cfm?contactForm=emailamy&amp;submit=Go)

Dear Senator,

I am writing to you to ask that you vote against the upcoming bill, CISPA, which just passed the vote in the House of Representatives by a 248 to 168 vote. I do not like anything that I see in the bill in its current form, and some of my biggest concerns are:

    Huge expansion of government power, essentially creating a legal channel for spying on its own population
    Unprecedented control of the government over the Internet, which has recently demonstrated huge opposition to bills like SOPA, PIPA, and CISPA
    Lack of privacy controls (any and all information can and will be disclosed to the ""authorities"" should the bill pass in its current form)
    No safeguards that the system this bill would create won't be used and abused by those with the authority to use the powers it grants
    Broadness in the definitions of various terms such as cyber security and cyber threats

Please consider these points carefully before you decide which way to vote. Bills such as CISPA and SOPA make me feel extremely uncomfortable about my government. Just thinking that somebody might be reading all of my personal communications with my friends or relatives sends shivers up my spine. I don't want any website to give out information that I confidentially disclosed to them, with a flimsy reason such as ""sharing images""--an act qualified as a cyber threat by CISPA.

This issue is extremely important to me, as if passed, it would send the relationship between the government and the Internet (which has generally been hands-off) spiraling in the wrong direction. I urge you to support my views on this act and views of countless other people in our state.

I had an epiphany in the car today about how to conduct a scavenger hunt, and I decided r/TCS would be a good place to go to.

Anyways, my idea is to have an r/tcs scavenger hunt, where there are 45 or so things we'd give clues to. Whoever can get the most would win a prize which would be determined at a later date. The clues would be riddles, but not completely impossible to decipher.

What I'd need is a show of interest, and a few select people who are intimately familiar with their various portions of the city. We would then come up with a handful of things to be found, and a date for participants to upload an imgur album showing them with said things. Teams of a limited size would be allowed. 

The winner would get no less than a small resin statue of a cat wearing a nice sun hat.

I've always met new friends from current friends and have always had a hard time going out alone trying to meet people. I'm 24, male. I'm a huge nerd and love games of all sorts. politics, science, astronomy, technology are all interests of mine. I've always been active, ready to drop anything I'm doing to go out. I guess what I'm really getting at is has anyone else found themselves in this same circumstance and how'd you fix it. Feel kind of weird coming out to reddit like this but figured I'd give it a shot.	t5_2r5mc	True

I miss playing. None of my friends are into it though, so it'd be great to dust it off and get together with some people who are also looking to play. 

Unfortunately, my living situation isn't really conductive to supporting a game night, so it'd have to be at someone else's place, but I'd be willing to supply the game, the Wii, and 3 gamecube controllers (and, I GUESS a wii-mote....if you consider that playing). 

If enough people show interest, I'd organize a meetup to play Brawl.

**UPDATE**   Hey guys, we have a ton of people interested and I've found someone nice enough to host us all at their apartment, so it looks like this thing will actually happen! The date we're looking at is Saturday, July 30. It's not set in stone yet, so let us know if that doesn't work and maybe we could postpone it till August if enough people complain....

Anything on the higher end of that seems like more than enough for sledding, and temperatures during the day tomorrow are supposed to be in the mid-twenties, which is pretty much perfect.  Anyone want to try for a sledding meetup (h/t autobahn for being the first to suggest this)?

~~I am open to any and all suggestions for the location and time, but it should probably be in the afternoon to avoid overlap with the poker meet (also, it's supposed to get pretty cold tomorrow night).  **Since nobody has given any input on the time, I will propose 1:00 PM.  That's late enough that the roads should be plowed and late sleepers won't be too inconvenienced, and early enough that there will still be several hours of daylight available.

Location - [Town &amp; Country Golf Course](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=858&amp;q=44.949383%2C%20-93.196175&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl) in St. Paul (h/t worduphomefry)

Time - 1:00 PM

No RSVP is required, and anyone and everyone is welcome to join us!  (Yes, that includes you, lurkers.)

If you have any extra sleds to spare, please bring them along for those who don't have one.  Also, if you have one available I recommend bringing a camera that can take videos because first-person videos taken while sledding are awesome.  I'm bringing my crappy old point-and-shoot for this purpose, so the event will be documented for posterity in very low resolution.  There is (I believe) parking available along the west side of the Town &amp; Country Club.  I don't think there's any risk of towing because St. Paul has not declared a snow emergency yet, but you should definitely double-check this if you are parking on the street.

It's hard to adequately advertise with a very small budget and I'm worried our audiences will be on the small side.  So: Dear Twin Cities Redditors, I invite you to come be entertained by a new theater company--the show is good and we could really use your support.  Tickets are sliding scale and pay-what-you-can.

1284949520.0	dg5td	COME CELEBRATE OUR 500TH TWIN CITIES SOCIAL MEMBER! We're watching a movie on the side of my house this week in Minneapolis! Saturday the 25th(?) Bonfire, keg, lawn games, and some PS3 games too.	grandeandy	25	1	109	"Yes, sudden, I know. I would have coordinated this further out, but there were some family member health issues I was busy dealing with. So let's get down to it!

I'm leaning towards Saturday the 25th starting at 5pm. I'm open to Friday night though if people want that! My grass is plush as carpet, I have assembled the bonfire pit, and it's getting dark enough to begin the showing around 7pm!

Whatever we watch has to be on Blu-Ray for the projector setup graciously being provided by Midwest_Product. The Big Lebowski is sadly not on Blu-Ray from what I can tell, so we've got to find something else. Fifth Element was mentioned, but I'm not really a fan. Don't worry, not too hard to please cinematically, so I'm sure we can come up with something worth watching. Fight Club? Office Space? Kickass? Hot Tub Time Machine? a Judd Apatow film? Funny is ideal.

Let's try to keep a 2:1 ratio on guys to girls to encourage the lady TCSers to come out. Also will pick up a keg if everyone is willing to pitch in $5. Be sure to bring a sweatshirt, a blanket or chair, and optionally a hat if you tend to get cold.

*This event is subject to weather conditions. RSVP in this thread and I'll PM you the address details the day before. I'm in South Minneapolis (Longfellow Neighborhood).*

**UPDATE #1 (9/21 @ 6:10pm)** 

Alright, put together a list together of Redditors who have RSVPed. Please let us know if your status changes, if I got it wrong, or if you want to be added to the list.

* In the ""I'll be there"" camp (28 + guests): midwestproduct, gwagn, grandeandy, sgtscherer, karbassi, muffinmix83, ironiridis, grondin, dkinmn, drifter35, ninjatarian, twonuh, uninternaute, allforumer, fortunamatata, worduphomefry, squidtropolis, PepperJackCrackers, cyberneticwebuser, dorkbait, definitelynotaspy, hans1193+wife, asad+gf, panndder, PikaPikaChick, WalkerMidwestRanger, rofltraut 
* On the fence (6 + a few guests): chadsterrr (+guest), Level1Troll, nikuryori, rofltraut (+guest), VoodooD2, lespea
* I'll exclude the ""can't do it""s and skip straight to the ""grandeandy has no idea if you RSVPed but maybe you did?"" (3): i-like-water, amiknotmyself, interg12

We've got a few ladies attending but our ratio could certainly be closer to the goal of 2:1 guys/girls! Do your part ladies of TCS and be sure to represent!

We're honing in on a movie... Inglorious Bastards is the most likely candidate at the moment, though I have a buddy with a few dozen Blu-Ray movies who is going to send me his list. Will try to finalize our movie selection in the next day or two.

Also, at this point it's fair to say that we'll have a keg with this many people. Keep kicking those beer ideas out there! 

Forecast is looking decent so far. Slight chance earlier in the day of rain, but then clearing to partly sunny with highs in the upper 60s, dropping to lows at night in the 50s.

RSVP if you have not! This is going to be a fun one!!!

** Update #2 (9/22/10 @ 3:30pm) **

Go to the beer selection thread to help us figure out which kegs to get: http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/dhijx/alright_time_to_pick_one_or_two_kegs_for/

** Update #3 (9/23/10 @ 6:30pm)**

FYI, kegs have been ordered for Saturday evening's backyard movie! 8 gallons of Summit EPA, 5 gallons of Fat Tire. Talked to the manager, and in the unlikely event that we need to reschedule due to weather, they'll accommodate us.

** Update #4 (9/24/10 @ 2:30pm)**

We're watching the weather closely. So far we're still on for tomorrow. I'll be PMing out my address tonight to those RSVPed, but remember to check back here a few hours before the event to make sure we're still on and not rescheduling!

Movie choice is between Inglorious Bastards and Kick-Ass. Please post opinions on these if you have them!

** Update #5 (9/25/10 @ 12:30am)**

PMed my address and details out to all the RSVPs! Please let me know if you didn't get it. If you still want to attend, say something as soon as you can so I know to message you! Remember to check back in the afternoon to make sure we're still on given the weather, but we most likely will be! Looking forward to what should be a sweet event! See you tonight!


** Update #6 (9/25/10 @ 12:10pm)**

Chance of showers keeps dropping, now 20%. The grass is still a little damp from the rain overnight, but it's drying quickly. We should be good to go! If you don't see any other updates here before our event, we're on!"	t5_2r5mc	True

Soccer players/Rugby Players/No Exp/ Male and Females!	lockback	30	8	9	"Gaelic Football is a traditional Irish Sport that is played in the US and has a steady following in the Twin Cities. We have been playing since 2007 and typically travel a few times a year to other clubs (we were the 2012 Midwest Classic Champions in KC, and just got 2nd in 2013). 

We are a group of men and women actively looking for new players of all experience levels. You may have seen us playing at the St Paul Irish fair each year. We have players of all ages and ability levels, and the vast majority of the club joined without any prior knowledge of the game. We welcome all new comers, and are looking for both adults and under-18 (with parental permission, or even better, participation!)

The club practices weekly, Wednesdays at 6pm at McDonough Park and Sundays at 2:00pm at the same location. We run scrimmages, games, and travel every year for tournaments. We welcome players who are looking to compete as well as those just looking for a fitness activity. Players with experience in soccer, rugby, lacrosse, or Hurling will find this sport similar in many ways.

Wednesday Practice: 6pm-8pm at McDonough

Sunday: 2-4pm

The Rusty Quarter has fallen on hard times and needs our help! from their [website](http://www.rqarcade.com/):

&gt;Dear Customers,
  Everyday is a fun day for us. We always get to see new faces walk through our doors, excited to see the glowing screens and pew-pew noises from each arcade and pinball machine. It’s fun to make new friends that remember playing these arcade games when they were a kid or watching parents with their little ones, huddled over a game and cheering with their son or daughter as they jump that barrel, stomp on the turtle, or shoot that last spaceship.

  &gt;We always hear you guys and gals cheer, “Thank you for doing this, for opening up in my neighborhood.”… And we always respond with, “Hey if it wasn’t for you guys showing up, we wouldn’t have a fun place for you guys to hang out”.

&gt;But the way things are going, Rusty Quarters might have shut our doors forever.

  &gt;Recently we’ve seen a drastic decline in attendance. Drastic enough that it is affecting our day-to-day business. Some of this is due to the recent odd weather (warm/cold/warm/raining). Some is due to recent public badmouthing of local small Mom &amp; Pop businesses that rely on hobby fandom to survive. And some maybe just for a the fact that the novelty of bringing a retro video arcade back to life has just faded by way of the dinosaur…

  &gt;We are currently in a high rent lease, locked in for 2 more years. We started this labor of love with a very small shoestring budget. We have spent every penny to continue to keep us open. (Sage had to sell his car for us to stay afloat. Just one among many other personal sacrifices.) We’ve tried our best get a Small business loan but have been denied at every turn. (Turns out, you have to have money to borrow money) We are too small of retail space for a food/alcohol license…

  &gt;Bottom Line, if business doesn’t pick up soon for Rusty Quarters, we will have to close our doors June 1st.

  &gt;We’re not asking for all of your hard earned money. All we’re asking for are your spare quarters, which believe it or not truly add up. With your continued support of this neighborhood small business, we’ll keep you guys playing with new games in a kid safe and clean environment. Hey, who knows, maybe with your continued support we’ll be able to move into that bigger space… maybe this time with a hamburger grill or a pizza oven.

&gt;Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you soon!

I volunteer for a non-profit Animal Rescue called Secondhand Hounds. They rescue thousands of animals a year from places like Minneapolis animal control, puppy mills, hoarding situations, owner surrenders, you name it.  Since I began volunteering with them, I have met a ton of amazing dogs that I have fallen in love with and watched them go to awesome homes. I have cleaned kennels, shaved dogs so matted they had a hard time walking, clipped matted feces out of long haired dogs who were not cared for properly.. met dogs who are so terrified of people because of the situations that they came from that they refuse to come out of a kennel even for a treat (some who don't even know what a treat is!), and seen the same dogs come out of their shells on the way to being great pets and living the lives they deserve. It is super awesome, and I love doing it...  and here is why I am telling you this...

This year I am participating in the No-Kill walk for Animals and raising funds that will directly go to benefit Secondhand Hounds vet bills.  SHH is super awesome about rescuing dogs that others would overlook... Puppies who are sick with Parvo, Dogs with tumors, [Luxating Patella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxating_patella), Dogs who need eyes removed.. you name it. SHH does not turn their back on these dogs, so the need for fundraising to help with vet bills is always great. 

Here is the link to my fundraising page... http://givemn.razoo.com/story/Team-Corgi-2012 The walk is just a few weeks away, and every little bit will help me meet my goal to support this wonderful rescue.

If you aren't able to donate, or wish not to because you have no idea who I am or why you should (which is understandable) I urge you to at least check out the rescue webpage www.SecondhandHounds.org and consider fostering, volunteering, or even adopting an animal. I would be happy to answer any questions if you are interested in getting involved!"	t5_2r5mc	True

So I talked to PoppaTCS/Grondin today at a meetup and he said a lot of you would like to play some D&amp;D.  I've got all the stuff to run a Pathfinder game, and a nice place to do it in. We can easily accomodate 5 other people in my apartment with a nice large playing surface. 

Pathfinder is just a continuation on D&amp;D 3.5 rules by a 3rd party company for people who don't like the direction 4th edition went. If that doesn't mean anything to you I'm sure we won't mind explaining the rules. The main gist is that Pathfinder provides a very detailed framework to build a comprehensive adventure of whatever shape or form that you want.

I live around Central Ave NE and 20th, about 2-3 miles north of Downtown with my girlfriend (I just started my late 20's). There's plenty of parking in a lot behind our building and on the streets around it plus bus stops. Also my girlfriend wants to practice her baking skills and any players would be treated to free cake and other delicious baked goods.

For the campaign I'm open to suggestions, but I wouldn't mind to GM a game based in the setting in the last campaign I played in. I like adventures that are based more on having an adventure, with no min/maxing or munchkining or world of warcraft style things. 

Here's a tidy list of bulleted things I like in a campaign:

* No minmaxing, if you have a dump stat you should suffer the effects of it!

* Avoiding/talking/solving an encounter grants the same xp as fighting your way through it. Bonus xp for using your wits and coming up with creative solutions!

* Fights you can't win if you are foolish

* Travelling across the wilderness and facing all the challenges of a rough undeveloped world

* Dungeons that involve just as much puzzle solving/traps as fights

* Just generally enjoying an adventure and allowing yourself to experience living in another world

* Affecting the world with actions of your party e.g. buying a boat and ruining trade routes, or becoming a property holding noble of a city, or saving a town from destruction (or allowing it to be destroyed and looting the remains)

* Using miniatures and making really detailed areas for us to explore/fight in

* Not following rules to the letter, allowing as much room for creativity and fun as possible!

If these things sound appealing to you we would probably enjoy playing together. I'm just heavily into the intellectual side of adventuring in a world that is not kind to people who don't use their problem solving skills.

For scheduling, I work at home and have extremely flexible hours and sleep scheduling, so if there's enough interest we can just work on picking whatever time of the week and make it happen.

Just reply or send me a message if you would be interested in playing. We can have alcohol, but no area for smoking here really, you'd have to go downstairs and go outside (we live on the top floor of our apartment building). I don't think any campaign that I would play in would be very friendly for youngins (like your 12-13 year old kids) I'd advise being at least 18.

So just let me know if you're interested, I can provide everything we need to play, including the materials, the rules, the minis, the dice, pens, paper, character sheets, the venue, the food, the gm, and consistent availability and preparedness of all the above said things.


**SUPERCOOL EDIT** Looks like a bunch of people are interested, grondin knows what he's talking about! I'll start contacting people individually. I'd like to do a weekly game, and based on comments below it seems like sometime on Tuesday,Wednesday, or Thursday and around 6ish pm to start.  We'll give this a few days to see who else might be interested and we'll see who is really available and then have a meeting at my place to see what we can do!

Be sure to dress nicely and be *very* respectful, this is a big deal and an amazing opportunity to get involved politically. The bill if passed will pave the way for a new Surly Brewery to be built, will create 150 permanent Minnesota jobs, a landmark, and a sweet rooftop view of the cities to grab a drink. The bill itself would remove a restriction that prevents Surly from selling beer on their premise (at the restaurant and rooftop beer garden they plan on building).

1329753055.0	pxvhb	Must see: Davina and the Vagabonds	hblask	32	11	13	"I saw them Saturday night at the Dakota, and it was spectacular.  Davina and the Vagabonds are firmly rooted in New Orleans jazz, but most groups that play that style feel like they heard it, liked it, and decided to perform it.   When you watch Davina, you think she *invented* it.   She's got a fresh, modern twist to jazz that makes it all her own, as if everyone else is just imitating her.

I've been to a lot of concerts in the decades I've been seeing live music, and this was by far the most fun I've had.   They throw themselves into their music 100%.    Many bands will fall into their stage presence for long stretches, performing the way they think they should act.   You don't get that with them.  They are 100% in the moment.   They completely lack pretense, even for a moment.

They are performing again at the Dakota on Tuesday the 21st (tomorrow, as I post this).   If you are a person who can stay up late on a weeknight, go see it.   Otherwise, you can check their [official website](http://davinaandthevagabonds.com/) for their schedule.  They play here in town frequently.   (She lives here now).

It's hard to capture her energy and fun on video, or even in a single song, but [here's the closest I could find online](http://www.mnoriginal.org/art/?p=2052).

What: **Iron Chef type BBQ challenge.**

When: **Saturday, July 2nd**

Rules: (Negotiable - taking suggestions)

Contestants will compete in a yard game to determine order of selecting meat cuts.

Meat cuts will mostly be ""normal"" but there may also be some zingers in there.

Each player will select 2 cuts of meat and prepare two BBQ dishes.

Contestants will have 8 hours (10am - 6pm) to complete their two dishes.

I will supply general BBQ ingredients for rubs/sauces/etc. I will supply a variety of wood chunks for smoking (mesquite, hickory, applewood). I will supply charcoal.

Contestants responsible to bring their grill (and propane if that's the way you roll).

Contestants will be allowed to bring their own secret ingredients as long as it is NOT meat.

We will need 5 judges to sample each dish and rate them.

Non-participants may attend and we will have hamburgers, hot dogs, brats, etc. for them and hopefully enough of the contestants food for some samples.

We will have the pool (above ground Intex), yard games and music available.

People are welcome to come and share homebrew and even make some batches if they wish.

Winner of the BBQ Cookoff will receive an award/prize (undecided on what).

Who would be interested?

Would contestants be willing to pay an entry to cover meat/prizes?

Anyone have any suggestions on the whole process?

Modeled after summer festivals held across Japan, it features stage performances, cultural demonstrations, activities, and, of course, Japanese food.  The event is reminiscent of Japan’s annual Obon holiday, an important cultural and family event.  During this holiday it is said that ancestral spirits revisit their families for three days.  Many people will return home to pay their respects at grave-sites, and often small paper lanterns are lit and floated down the river to guide ancestor’s spirits. The Obon Festival also features the Bon Odori, or folk dance, in which all are invited to join in the circle and dance.

Check out this [spread sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0Asu8byHar-a8dHRjX2g0TlJhdmFLc1V0Q2ZwekJBdkE&amp;usp=sharing) where you can volunteer to bring food and anything else we might need.

Make sure to mark yourself as attending if you plan in coming. I plan in bringing a camera to take a group photo at then and and am willing to send that photo to anyone else who wants it. Feel free to bring your own camera as well. We still have quite a bit of work to do, food, drinks and volunteers needed, but I have high hopes and I think we can do this.

I've been looking at organizing a great big awesome Twin Cities/St Louis crossover meetup, and, while it would be a good few months, I like planning ahead.

So, a few questions-

-Are you interested? If not, why not? What makes you apprehensive?

-When would be good for you? I was thinking late summer, probably August, or maybe over Labor Day weekend.

-Would you rather stay with a St. Louis redditor (assuming there are willing hosts) or pay for a hotel?

-If paying for a hotel, would you be willing to share a room? A bed? Strictly same sex, or co-ed?

-Do you have a car to drive down? If not, are you willing to help pay for gas to drive down?

-What would you like to do on this trip? The adult sized playground in question is the City Museum. Other than that, I'm pretty open!

Comments, questions, concerns? Mind you, this is just a preliminary interest-checking post. I like planning.

We were originally going to go to a place where I knew someone who had been shot there, but worduphomefry cock-blocked me and said we have to go to northeast this week. So northeast we go. 

Vegas Lounge everyone. Never been there, but it has karaoke. They don't appear to have specials that day, but supposedly cheap to begin with.

This testimonial says it all:

“I wanted a place I could get Blitzkrieg-drunk, Sing some Zeppelin, meet Friendly people that wont judge slightly boistrous drunks, and at the end of the night my roommates and I could stumble home… Enter the Vegas Lounge. My new favorite guilty obsession.”

There's never any traffic, and when I get there, I park for free a few feet from the door to the office.  Can buy lunch for 5 bucks.  


Coming up soon, we are needing to find a new office location.  We are a small group, and one of my coworkers is really pushing for us to get some executive suite offices in downtown Minneapolis.  Now, granted, that cuts his commute from 40 minutes to 10, but he also says it is awesome to work downtown, with a great view, and the skyway, and good places to get lunch.


I really want to have an open mind about it and give it fair consideration, but I have to admit my initial reaction is pretty negative.  When I think of downtown, I think of gridlock and traffic jams, no parking, and expensive food.  When it snows, it takes you 3 hours to drive home.  Sitting in standstill traffic for 20 minutes just to cover the last quarter mile on 35W to get off the freeway.  Driving around for 30 minutes trying to find a parking spot.  $20 lunch.

1332394038.0	r7zqw	I was offered an awesome job in Minneapolis, but I'm VERY hesitant to uproot from my beloved city of Seattle. Help?	walnutwhale	25	5	97	"Hi! Just today I received a call with a potential job offer for an incredible company that would essentially be a HUGE stepping stone on the pathway into my career of choice (a career that is very difficult to get into). While nothing is finalized, I'm already feeling anxiety because aforementioned job is in Minneapolis. For the last two years I have lived in Seattle, the city that is essentially the love of my life (I fought tooth and nail to move here from a small town). I'm finally feeling settled with a good and creative friend group and a very deep involvement in communities in my interest group. I have a well paying job with coworkers that I adore (though it is not in my intended field), a brand new apartment I moved into two months ago, etc.

Basically, I would have taken this job in two seconds with zero hesitation if it weren't for its location. I know absolutely nothing about Minneapolis except that it's in Minnesota.

A little about me: I am incredibly geeky, involved in cosplay, video games, comic books, acting, filming, etc. I make pretty popular youtube videos, I'm in a two piece nerd band, I spend the majority of my time at anime/comic book/video game conventions for my freelance writing work. In my ""free time"" I go to bars, go to shows (indie rock etc), get involved in the art community, coordinate events, do photography. I'm very liberal, unique, fashion forward, intellectual. I like to be involved with people who are ""do-ers"": Right now I'm helping make a huge web series, working on two web comics, organizing events for comic conventions, modeling in fashion shows, acting in shorts and indie films, etc. I NEED a vibrant creative community to survive.

Please, tell me anything and everything about Minneapolis that might help me with this decision!

tl;dr I'm an eccentric geeky fashionista with a focus on the entertainment industry who loves the Pacific Northwest but might need to uproot to Minneapolis for epic job. Tell me about your city."	t5_2r5mc	True

Lately, I've noticed that they have been playing a lot of the same crap that KDWB and 96.3 NOW plays. Actually on several occasions all three stations played the same Rihanna song which annoys the crap out of me.
So I went up to the girl at the booth and had this conversation:

""Hi, I've noticed that you've been playing a ton of Rihanna, Enrique, and Usher, yet your slogan is '90s, 2k, and today' it would be cool if you played more 90's music because you're playing the same music as everyone else""

""No we do play 90's music all the time""

""The only time you play 90's is either Sarah Mclachlan or Alanis Morissette, yet you play Katy Perry 4 times a day""

""Well we'll take your comment under consideration""

""No I don't think you really will""

""No you're right we won't, also I'll forget we had this conversation when you leave""

I was sort of kidding around but now that she was being stupid and rude I went straight to the MPR booth and gave them money for being awesome (Science Fridays rules) and it made the lady happy."	t5_2r5mc	True
1313264906.0	jhwcv	Dungeons and Dragons one-off session for the die-curious.  Never played but always wanted to?  Aug 20th @ 5pm 	helenofblank	29	11	35	"So you've always heard that [Dungeons and Dragons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dQYhzpuH4A&amp;feature=related) is a grand time but you've always been too busy/intimidate/nervous/embarrassed to try it out.   This is the perfect opportunity for you!  This is a one-time session specifically for those wishing to learn how to play and to find out what the fuss is all about.  

**What you'll need?**  Nothing! I have everything you'll need to play.  If you want to bring beer/drinks/food that would be grand, though it isn't necessary. 

**What do you need to prepare?** Nothing! I'll make a level 1 character for you if you like, all you need to do is let me know before the game what kind of character you'd like to play.  For example, ""I'd like to play a female dwarf who is sneaky, uses ninja stars, and can talk her way out of any situation.""  If you want to make your own character make a 1st level 4th edition character according to the Player's Hand Book (including starting equipment).  All official races/classes are ok.  If you want to make something ridiculous but you are not sure if it's allowable feel free to ask.  

**How long of a commitment is it?** This is a one time session, so basically just 4-6 hours of your time. If you dig it and want to play again or you can't make it to this session, no problem I'll probably be doing it again in a month or so.  Most likely in a different location.  

**What kind of game will it be?**  In Dungeons and Dragons the adventure's tone is entirely up to the people at the table.  The dungeon master or DM sets up the world so usually the tone of the game follows their lead.  The games I run are lighthearted and absurd.  Laughs and ridiculous antics rather than super serious grimdark BS.  Terry Prachett rather than George R. R. Martin.  

So that's about it.  **It will be located [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;sugexp=gsih&amp;cp=46&amp;gs_id=5k&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=4100+tyler+Street+NE+Columbia+Heights+MN+55421&amp;qe=NDEwMCB0eWxlciBTdHJlZXQgTkUgQ29sdW1iaWEgSGVpZ2h0cyBNTiA1NTQyMQ&amp;qesig=15DTysWY2nyYSZ6fO1Yfgw&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tmeMSA6jb4Os6ccGUZ-QjUk5x40XBKxGXftr21vwZhi-NcNz5uGlMg2c2e-1r3U_BKz0wY33lT7UK1fZvD_cKhDmSwjMg&amp;gs_upl=&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=709&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x52b32e6675479309:0x685f3e42f6b3fa22,4100+Tyler+St+NE,+Columbia+Heights,+MN+55421&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=2sVGTr3cEcnjsQKVoaWSCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ8gEwAA) in Columbia Heights at 5pm.**  Anyone and everyone is welcome, even if you just want to watch.  Please post if you will be coming and if you need me to make a character for you.  

 *For those with animal allergies please take note I have both a dog and a cat. They are both totally rad though.*    

 UPDATE:  
So far this is who I have as possibly coming and what they are playing.  We are looking at  about 6-9 players.  This should be fine for a first game where you are just learning how to play.  If you are on the fence about being able to make it I'll most likely do another one of these somewhere else in the city in a month or so.

Right now my wife and I are mostly considering stuff around SLP, Linden Hills, Richfield, etc.  We like the area because it is relatively close to where we will be working, and as far as I can tell it seems like a great area.

One issue we have is that we need to rent, and it must be a house due to some weird relocation rules.  A lot of the condos in the area seem pretty awesome, but we can't really go in that direction.  Since we will be renting the house, we won't be doing any improvements to it either.  So we are trying to find a relatively-updated house that is available for rent, which has so far proved to be a daunting task...

I know that we could move further out towards Minnetonka or Plymouth, but we'd rather try to stay centrally located.  Are there other areas we could consider where we might be able to find something?  

edit: From another comment --

We are both in our late 20s, no kids (yet). We like close proximity to ""useful"" shopping (e.g. grocery stores, places like Target, etc.), and also to good local restaurants. We prefer to live near the heart of a city, but not necessary right in the middle of it. I love riding my bike on greenways and such so close proximity to those is a huge plus. But overall, we tend to be homebodies, so having a comfortable, up-to-date place to live is extremely important."	t5_2r5mc	True

We talked about this briefly at the beer meet-up Friday night, and it got a good reception for the most part. So, I figured I'd put up a thread a little in advanced to see what the community thought of it. My idea is that we would have a meet-up to go tubing down the Apple River in Somerset, WI in late May/early June (depending on how warm May is). Thoughts?

Edit: We would be allowed to bring beer and whatnot to drink as well, making the experience 10x more fun!

Edit2: Lots of hate for the Apple River! There are other places, just the first one that popped into my head. Last time I went, it was surprisingly clean, and I didn't see more than 5 pieces of trash the entire way.

Edit3: Again, I understand the hate for that river. That's fine! However, I'd appreciate more constructive comments (other locations maybe) instead of adding another log to the fire of ""the river is dirty"". :)"	t5_2r5mc	True

1291859953.0	einpd	Hey TCS, anyone interested in learning to drive better on snow and ice?	autobahn	19	1	28	"Just wanted to put this out there:

Glacier Lakes Quattro Club is putting on their winter ice driving events again this year. Basically, they plow a skidpad, an oval, and a ~2mi road course onto Lake Cynthia in Prior Lake (it's shallow so it freezes almost completely solid in winter by the first event, zero risk). 

Dates:
- Sunday, January 16
- Sunday, January 30
- Sunday, February 13
- Sunday, February 27

There are a number of excercises, including slalom, braking, and accident avoidance maneuvers in order to help improve your skills.

It is absolutely incredible how much you learn in just one day ""on the ice"". There's no better environment to learn in as there's nothing to run into out on the ice, and at the worst you might get stuck and have to be pulled back on the course by one of the trucks that will be out there with a tow strap.

I will be at all four events, but probably as a helper at the last 2 or 3. Many people go to all four events every year, as it's not only educational, but a lot of fun!

If you have any questions, let me know. I highly suggest these events for anyone who wishes to improve their driving skills.

If you're interested in registering, unless you have previous ice/snow driving experience and don't need an instructor, make sure to check the ""first time adult"" checkbox so they make sure to have an instructor there for you. Don't worry, nobody is there to judge your abilities or anything like that. 

[Link to more info and pre-registration.](http://www.glacierlakesqclub.org/2010/08/30/ice-driving-events-january-february-2011/) No payment is required up front, it's typically handled ""at the lake"".

**EDIT**: GLQC also puts a special emphasis on teen instruction at these events. If you know anyone with a teenager, let them know about this event! We've had great success with teens in the past and parents have been absolutely thrilled with their progress. It's great for young drivers!"	t5_2r5mc	True

Rilmawen	22	4	21	"So after posting in the book club subreddit and getting no responses, and since I really want to meet new people and love to read books, I've decided to start a new book club!

I'm open to all genres, but I mention sci-fi/fantasy as a starting point. (I'm aware they are two entirely separate genres).

I'm thinking to meet first to get an idea of who wants to do what on Monday August 5th. If not, I""ll probably switch to a weekend or something. I'm thinking meeting once or twice a month to discuss books, or maybe even more if there's enough interest.

I'm open to any ideas of books. I'm hoping each book will be easily accessible to people so that they don't have to spend a ton of money to participate, books like classics or ones that should be readily available at a library or something.

The first book I'd like to read (Not for August 5th, but for a later date) would be the Silmarillion, and center on that for the first month or so. If not, I have a few other ideas in mind.

If you're interested, feel free to post here or PM me!

We are both from the NYC/Tri-State area, and know nothing about the mid-west except from the research that we have already done. We would really appreciate it if you guys could provide some information/advice on what we should look out for when it comes to living (finding apartments) and finding a job in the mid-west? I'll provide some basic info about us below, I will answer any questions if needed. 

Information:
We both want to try something completely different to NYC, and really like the charm/culture of the Twin Cities.

She graduated last year with degrees in International Management and Quantitative Business Analysis (QBA), from a small NYC University, and is currently working at an IT Firm.

As for myself, I am graduating in May from the same university, with a BBA in Finance, and minors in QBA, and Economics. I have a pretty decent background in commodities. However, I am keeping my options open to anything.

We both don't have cars, and are wondering how much of a necessity they are for the area? We are also pretty big foodies, and I am a beer junkie.

Thanks!

EDIT: Forgot to mention, is there any russian community's there? My GF loves the food, just wondering if there was any

Thank you for the input/advice = D


EDIT 2: Sorry that I've been away from the post for about a week now, But we've decided we will be checking it out during my spring break.

In fact anybody who has regularly been reading /r/twincitiessocial for a while now has probably noticed a sharp increase in the number of, ""I need a roommate"" posts.

Because I'm a helpful guy I'm proposing an idea for a meetup: a monthly (bimonthly, annual, whatever) apartment seekers meetup. My idea is to bring all the /r/twincitiessocial apartment seekers together so they can meet one another and hopefully find the roommate of their dreams.

This could be done at a bar so apartment seekers can be blasted out of their minds. After all it's important to know how a person is going to act when they're drunk before living with them. The meetups could also be run like a speed dating service where people seeking roommates and interview one another in rapid succession.

Best of all this could reduce the number of , ""I need a roommate!"" posts. Instead of posting an anonymous message to an anonymous crowd you could actually show up to an event and meet real people who could be your future roommates!"	t5_2r5mc	True

1376013408.0	1jzz2c	Break the Bubble Minneapolis #2 -- Come meet new, friendly people (x-post from /r/Minneapolis)	decuirm	23	11	9	"**What is Break the Bubble, you ask?**

Break the Bubble is an event centered around meeting new, friendly people. Tomorrow's event is at 612 Brew, starting at 8pm.


**What makes Break The Bubble different?**

We've designed this event specifically to get you out and meet people! For one, it's at a brewery. People tend to open up a little after a few beers. For two, there will be a theme. Something to get people talking. Last month's event was a huge success, so we're going to run future events in a similar fashion. Show up, slap on a name tag, start talking to people.


The theme for this event will be ""Finish this sentence...""

If you're interested, please RSVP on the **[eventbrite page](http://breakthebubblempls2.eventbrite.com)**

Hope to see you there!"	t5_2r5mc	True

These meetups are for meeting people from Reddit. We get a fairly good mix of all sorts of people. Please be kind and respectful to each other and remember we are all human beings. We have new people every week, so don't be shy to become the new regular. Please exercise real life/internet safety in how you interact before, during, and after meetups. There are typically around ~~6 to 12~~ (expecting ~40 people) folks in attendance (keep this number in mind if/when you would like to make a suggestion in the future).
We prefer to tip well and keep our space clean, to ensure that we are welcome upon return and our food is never spit into!"	t5_2r5mc	True
