--- 

**1.** ***Big Bang*** **by Simon Singh**
&gt; A highly detailed and highly enjoyable history of astronomy and many key astronomers. It also gives an easy-to-understand walkthrough of the Big Bang Theory, as well as having a concise history of mathematics.

---

**2.** ***Surely You Must Be Joking, Mr. Feynman!*** **by Richard Feynman**

&gt; A funny collection of writings by Mr. Feynman, a brilliant and important physicist. The book also gives you insight into how astronomers gain their sparks of insight that lead to exciting new theories.

---

**3.** ***Death By Black Hole*** **by Neil DeGrasse Tyson**

&gt; A hilarious compilation of in-depth quandaries such as ""What would being sucked into a black hole feel like"" and ""What will it be like when our galaxy collides with another galaxy?"" 

&gt; Tyson is a brilliant writer, thinker, and speaker. If you've liked listening to his speeches, you'll love this book.

---

**4.** ***From Quarks to Quasars*** **by James Jespersen and Jane Fitz-Gerald**

&gt; An easy-to-understand break down of all the new and exciting astronomical ideas that came about this century. Once you read this, you will be able to discuss theoretical physics.

---

**5.** ***Masks of the Universe*** **by Edward Harrison**

&gt; On the cover it says ""A Physicist's remarkable portrayal of Mankind's Search for Meaning in the Universe."" This book ties in ancient culture's ideas about how the universe works with modern physics, and the coincidences are amazing.

---

**6.** ***The Elegant Universe*** **by Brian Greene**

&gt; A well written and well researched ""State of the Union Address"" for the current state of astronomy and physics. It talks about M-Theory and superstrings and all the other cool new things in science.

---

**7.** ***Cosmos*** **by Carl Sagan**

&gt; The classic introduction to the Universe written by the coolest physicist ever.

---

**8.** ***Dreams, Stars, and Electrons*** **by Lyman Spitzer, Jr.**

&gt; Another memoir about a great physicist. This book includes real physics research papers alongside Spitzer's comments on each one. The comments reveal how much physicists love their work and how they treat their research like intense hobbies.

---

**9.** ***Asimov's Guide to Halley's Comet*** **by Isaac Asimov**

&gt; An in-depth look at the history of Halley's Comet and our interactions with it. The book also explains comets and how our solar system works on a grand scale. This is a short book that is packed full of cool stuff.

I asked about it on [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/405215/how-to-label-tag-items-in-a-spreadsheet) and Excellll very kindly coded it up for me in Excel.

I’ve uploaded it [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66242346/booksiread.xlsx) so you may download and use it freely.

I prefer to use Google Spreadsheets, though. But it uses JavaScript for its scripts. I’m a lousy noob at JS so if anyone can code it up for us all, it would be fantabulous!

Hope this is useful for some of you. Do tell me if I'm posting in the wrong subreddit."	t5_2se0c	True
