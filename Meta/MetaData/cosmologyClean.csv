1365433938.0	1bx5yq	Do you ever get overwhelmed in thinking about the Cosmos?	Marmks	83	11	40	"I've loved learning everything there is to know about the cosmos for as long as I can remember. It is my absolute favorite topic of thought.

Nothing blows my mind more than thinking about things like the size-relativity between Earth and the Sun and our galaxy and then truly massive objects such as that newly discovered quasar cluster U1.27. Or thinking about the sheer number of planets and stars and galaxies that are out there. And then thinking about the incredible distances between those galaxies. There's no way humans will ever come close to even discovering a fraction of what is out there to discover! 

It can make me feel quite insignificant sometimes, but at the same time I take comfort in knowing that all of this somehow exists on its own, regardless of human existence. In a way, humans (and the other probable intelligent lifeforms throughout the Universe) are just a sort of consciousness of the Cosmos. It's really incredible to think about.

Sorry if this post seems slightly disjointed. This is something that has been on my mind a lot lately, and through reading /cosmology I know I can't be the only one that gets overwhelmed (in a good way) by all of this. 

Sagan seemed to be in a constant state of mind=blown.

I did a search without any results.  I'm researching, and building my universe for my story, and I'm attempting to be as realistic as the story will allow.  Some writers, I believe, construct their star systems at random, with conveniently habitable planets in plot-friendly locations.  I'm avoiding that.  So, my questions are:

1. Is there an application (pref. Mac) like Stellarium that would allow for the (a) placement of a Point of View from a distant star (b) or, would allow for the placement of hypothetical planets around that star?  I realize that's a real long shot, but I know Stellarium will allow you to change your location to other objects *within* the Solar system, so I figure it's worth a shot to see if that feature may exist.
2. Is there any type of application that would essentially be a planet builder?  And I realize that's an even longer shot.  See I'm currently using some calculations for habitable zones around stars [obtained here](http://www.planetarybiology.com/calculating_habitable_zone.htm), and selecting stars from the Turnbull, Tarter HabCat.  But visualization would be excellent, and if there's an application that would do some of the calculations, that would be great.

Sorry for the long post.  There's no real way to TL/DR that one.  If there's no clear answer to those questions, if anyone knows of a more direct method of getting the information I'm looking for, I'd love to hear it.  Thanks in advance!"	t5_2r5v1	True

1357365574.0	15zupx	Two questions about dark matter	FormerDittoHead	28	7	17	"Strictly ignorant person here.

1) Everything I've seen shows that dark matter affects visible matter, but it doesn't seem to affect itself?  Why not?

It's commonly shown as giant globs surrounding galaxies (see video).  But why isn't it affected by its own mass / gravitational force? Shouldn't it start condensing / compressing onto itself?  Does it somehow send OUT gravity, remain somehow gathered in some consistent shape, but somehow not be affected by gravity?   Is it ""fluffy"" somehow?  If not gravity, what would allow it to maintain its ""shape"" but if it *is* affected by gravity, what keeps it fluffy?

example of dark matter halo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=PznhzHOtr_Y

side note: while the 85.5%(from memory) figure may be well confirmed, is that a *consistent* number?  That is, within a halo, are there ""pockets"" of dark matter more dense (gravitational) and others less dense?

The Bigger one:  For the purpose of this, I will use 100,000 light years as the diameter of ""a galaxy"" and 600k light years as the estimated diameter of a dark matter globule surrounding the visible galaxy.

2) Dark matter has been shown to exist (through inference) *all around* galaxies.   It's shown as a galaxy inside a giant round blob about 6x the size of the galaxy with the visible galaxy smack in the middle.

**But galaxies are known to collide.**  It's my understanding that when galaxies collide, the stars don't collide, but the gas and other interstellar matter *does* mix, stimulating star formation.  

But wouldn't the ""effect"" of dark matter of one galaxy distort the gravitational ""effect"" of the other to a measurable degree?  By itself, the speed of the visible matter on the outer rims of galaxies move in a way that's less than 1/6th in concert with understood physics.  

But, shouldn't adding the dark matter (as the galaxies move toward and then through each other) only distort the visible matter *that much more*?  Furthermore, wouldn't the effect be asymmetric as the collision would start on one end.

Indeed, referring back to the ""halo"" description of the dark matter, the distortion / effects on the oncoming galaxy should be measurable well over 100,000 light years before the visible part of the galaxy started touching the target galaxy.

**To me** the first one of these question/issues just doesn't make any ""sense"" but the *second* question / issue would probably be observable, and unless colliding galaxies don't exhibit a *near doubling* of the ""dark matter effect"", then it would pretty much disprove its existence, wouldn't it? 

Certainly, if you had two galaxies right in the middle of a collision, the two dark matter globs would be overlapping and the gravitational effect would be *doubled*, and I would think the gravitational effects would be that much more distorted.

Conversely, if the visible matter in galaxies *does* display some kind of added effect even before the visible matter started to intersect, that would pretty much prove dark matter's existence.

No physics background at all.  Please don't mock *very* loudly."	t5_2r5v1	True

1373748060.0	1i8ips	Hey /r/cosmology! Come spread some of your knowledge to /r/learnscience!	Aegis6	24	2	0	"Hey /r/cosmology! So recently I created a new sub, called /r/learnscience in order to help bring science education to the masses. My reasoning behind this is that, while we have many subs such as /r/chemistry and /r/biology and /r/physics, amongst others, who are dedicated to the appreciation of a subject, there aren't a whole lot of subs that are dedicated to actually teaching those subjects. Even places like /r/chemhelp and /r/physicsstudents aren't always focused on teaching new material. Therefore, I established /r/learnscience, whose main purpose is to provide a place for people to share knowledge and ideas regarding particular topics in their field of expertise. 

The concept is simple. A user submits a post either requesting to be taught a concept, or an ""expert"" (and I use that term lightly) creates a post explaining something that they are knowledgeable in. For example, a member of /r/chemistry might post something to the effect of ""[Chemistry] How to determine the pH of an aqueous solution"" and then go on to explain the procedure in the body of their post. Similarly, a high school student in biology might ask something along the lines of ""[Biology] What is a phylogenetic tree and how do you make one?"", where someone with a biology background could explain in the comments.

Constructive criticism is more than welcome, and I would be glad to hear your ideas/thoughts on the sub. Whether you are eager to learn some new things about science or looking to pass on your knowledge to others, we will be glad to have you!"	t5_2r5v1	True

As I understand from physicists and cosmologists, the universe likely originated from nothing.  What elements of modern cosmology point to a universe coming from nothing?  As I understand it, the big bang was the origin of time, space and matter.

Isn't the measure of time based upon the expansion of the universe from the start of the big bang forward since that is the beginning of observable motion?  Why couldn't the matter that made up the pre-universe exist infinitely before the event of the big bang?  In my head this makes sense since it could simply be sitting there and for a reason, rapidly expand resulting in our universe.

As I also understand it, the four forces of nature during the first fractions of a second of the big bang acted radically different in relation to each other and eventually, due to the rapid expanse moved to their current constant form that we know them to be.  I've heard the theistic argument that the universe seems to be fine tuned for life, however is there any evidence that the constants and forces of nature could have taken on any other value than what they currently reside at?  Could light have traveled at a different speed?  Could the strong force been any other value that it currently is?  It seems to be that if light could take on another value there would be evidence of being able to alter that value in some way.  As far as I know, there is no way to change the nature of photons on a universal scale.  It seems to me that the nature of light, gravity, weak force and other constants; are completely unalterable and could not take on any other value that what their nature truly is.  Or was there a defining moment in the big bang that defined the values of these constants?  

Because I find that rather bizarre, if during the process of the big bang that all universal constants were prescribed a certain way and weren't the result of their own existent nature and how they react to other particles of physics."	t5_2r5v1	True

Two other good resources (in order of increasing difficulty and length) is the [TASI lectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401547) with Mark Trodden, and the [free version](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9712019) of his textbook. Those 3 resources should get you up to the level of a Graduate Student.	t5_2r5v1	True

As many of you may know, the [""Density Parameter""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_parameter#Density_parameter) Or Omega Value, was a ratio proposed by Alexander Friedmann to describe the density of the universe needed to maintain a ""flat"" geometry, or at least a geometry which wouldn't result in collapse or desolation. Basically this ratio is:

**Actual Density of the Universe's Matter / Density Needed to Maintain a Stable, ""Flat"" Universe**

***

Robert Dicke showed that the universe, one second after the Big Bang, had an omega value of somewhere between 0.99999999999999999 and 1.00000000000000001.  If the density of the Universe after one second were larger than the 1.00...1 number, then the Universe would have collapsed in on itself, as the force of gravity outmatched the expansion force of the Universe. In the opposite case, if the Universe's omega value was less than 0.999...9, then the Universe wouldn't have been dense enough to slow it's own expansion through gravity, and it would have expanded *too* quickly, resulting in an extremely empty and desolate Universe. 

Supposedly, Dicke didn't just choose that ""one second"" because it was an everyday, and rather minuscule, duration. Dicke knew that we had, at the time of the late 1930s, hard **observational** evidence for the expansion of the Universe one second after the big bang.

So what's the Big Deal (purposeful capitalization, there), you might be asking. Don't we *know* that the Universe was expanding after the big bang, no matter the time?

Well, that's an assumption cosmologists would have had to work under if they didn't have observational evidence for the expansion of the Universe roughly a second after the Big Bang, but, to my surprise, apparently Cosmologists *did* have this empirical data!

So, my questions to you all are: What is this Observational Data? Why did Dicke pick that ""one second"" if not just because it was an easy duration for us to imagine? I've heard from a few places that it has to do with the instability of Hydrogen Bombs, somehow. Can someone please clarify this for me?

It's about the red shift effect observed on galaxies.
From what I get : The further away, the more the observed light is shifted toward the red. So we deduce that further away = faster, so universe expansion is accelerating.


Now how can we account for actual present speed, when the light we are measuring have been emitted billions years ago?

Wouldn't it mean the galaxies WERE going faster as they are older ? So isn't the universe slowing down ?

1358658960.0	16wzly	Confusion over the exact usage of redshift	Paramnesia1	17	5	7	"I'm currently reading papers on galaxy evolution, and a fair few mention things such as ""at least half of luminous red galaxies at z~0.2 must already have been well assembled by z~0.6"" or ""at z&lt;1, the majority of massive early-type-galaxies were already in place at z~0.7-0.8, with a number density consistent with the one at z=0."" 

The first quote confused me because it sounds like the redshift of galaxies is decreasing, which I know isn't true (for the vast majority anyway). So the only logical explanation I can come up with is that the 'z~0.6' part refers to time, unlike the 'z~0.2' part. But it's weird for them to change the precise definition mid-sentence. My lecturer said it's not the same galaxy changing redshift (which rules out the definition-of-redshift theory, right?), it just means the galaxies observed at z~0.2 were fully assembled at earlier times. But that sentence seems to contradict itself to me. If it's not the same galaxy (or same group of galaxies), how can the quote tell you what happened at an earlier time?

The second quote almost sounds like there's a peak in galaxy number at z~0.7-0.8, which again doesn't really make sense (why there?), so again, is it saying that for most galaxies within a redshift of 1 of us, they were already there at the age of the universe given by z~0.7-0.8?

I understand redshift is a measure of relative speed, and because the Universe is expanding, and the further away parts expand quicker, redshift is therefore a measure of how far away something is. How far away it is can also tell you how long ago it happened, given light's finite speed. So I guess what I'm asking is whether we change from distance given by redshift to time ago given by redshift (and vice versa), or if it's just about comparing groups of galaxies at different distances/redshifts?"	t5_2r5v1	True

After reading 'Something from Nothing' and watching his videos I am a little confused regarding one of his claims. He mentions that if you remove all the matter/fields/particles etc from a given space to make that space as 'empty' as we can. That space still contains virtual particles, which in turn contain energy which then gives mass to the 'so called' empty space. That's fine, I get that. He then continues to mention that 'according to him' Universes are then capable of spontaneously coming into existence from those quantum fluctuations within that empty space. However, doesn't this ""empty"" space still exist within the constraints of our own Universe? From what I understand the 'singularity' from which our Universe began would have existed outside of our Universe before inflation started and began to create the Universe we all know and love today.

Hopefully that makes sense.

I'm working on a science fiction novel that is kind of like Groundhog Day, except it's on an epic scale. I have some theoretical difficulties, however. 

The universe in which my story takes place is a cyclical ""big bounce"" universe, where every big bang is followed by a big crunch, creating a singularity which then detonates into another big bang. The twist is that the universe spawned by the big bang is EXACTLY the same as the previous universe, and so the same universe has existed an infinite number of times before. Time, here, is cyclical. Characters in my story travel ""backwards"" in time by surviving a Big Crunch inside of a spaceship, traveling away from the point of the singularity, believing that they are preserving the human race by doing so. 


My problem is with the properties of the boundary of the universe, the edge of space. If the universe is crunching, and you venture past the edge of the universe, what would happen? Would you pop into the universe on the opposite end, so that there can be no escape? Or would the universe split into two ""bubbles,"" one containing the singularity and one containing your ship? Or would the edge of space draw the ship along with it, as if it were a fabric or something, contracting?

Hi,
I'm about to choose grad-level courses in physics, and I'm not sure in what area of theoretical physics I want to end up.
Is a broad background in astronomy and astrophysics vital for cosmology? I'm asking this because if I start in that direction, and then change my mind (like ""oh no, I'd rather do string theory or whatever""), I would've read a lot of courses ""for nothing"" (I don't really wanna say for nothing, but they would've been unnecessary for some other areas of theoretical physics).
Can one become a cosmologist without a ton of astro courses? A professor told me something in the lines of ""well, you really should have and astro background, otherwise your take on cosmology will be more ""philosophical"", but that's my opinion"". So I'm asking you guys for a second opinion.
If shit goes bad I will either:
- Have read a lot of astro courses, and when going for a PHD in some other area, I'd be ""behind"" on ""more important subjects""
or
- Haven't read much astro at all, when trying for a PHD in the area of cosmology, I'd know little about that kind of stuff, but have tons of math and high-energy physics.

If so would it be feasable to extrapolate the point in space where the big bang occured based on collected data from red shifted and blue shifted objects?  Has this study in fact been done?  Or am I missing something?  I picture our place in the universe as being some point in say a fire cracker explosion as it expands.  Certainly not the center of that explosion but some where moving out from the center.  It seems reasonable then that given the data we already have, one could figure out and model the center.

MrLiquidose	14	6	31	First off, here is why I'm asking this question. I am writing a science fiction novel. In this novel, there are beings called Atomi. The Atomi are a light based life form, from a solar system formed on an event-horizon around a super-massive black hole. I base their 'solid/concrete' existence on a certain material called 'dimos' which is a material that was compacted in the collapse of a star. Dimos is an element that can withstand immense forces of gravity. I am a big advocate of having my ideas physically and scientifically logical, but this is a pretty far fetched scenario. Although its very unlikely to happen, theoretically speaking with logic, how could a solar system form around a super massive black hole, and what would it be like?	t5_2r5v1	True

so.. its the general consensus that our universe is expanding faster and faster. our basis for this is the red shift of galaxies as we look further and further away.. however.. we are also looking further and further back in time.. therfore could one reasonably conclude that the expansion is slowing down because as we look closer and closer to present day galaxies are less and less redshifted..

1375535964.0	1jmi0t	I'm sure there are variations on this idea	Simusid	14	6	3	"This months Discover Magazine has a cosmology article titled ""Starting Point"" and it is about some of the theories of physicist Alexander Vilenkin.   Some of the takeaways from the article for me are:

* The idea that ""inflation is eternal""  and can happen anywhere in the universe at any time
* Inflation requires ""extremely high energies"" such as existed in our early universe, allowing it to occur
* The ""cosmic egg"" theory of the universe which in the article was shown as a graphic  showing an initial tiny universe that exists for an essentially infinite amount of time at a static size, until at time T=0 ""suddenly the universe starts to expand"" i.e. inflation.

Ok so here is where I sound like a first year physics student sitting around smoking pot.   Our universe is not a random vacuum fluctuation.    The universe is a stable particle that acquired a photon with sufficient energy to push us to the next higher energy state.   That higher energy causes inflation.  At some point in the future we'll give up that photon and our universe will return to the ground state.

NoImagination85	11	4	5	"I have some kind of presentation to make about cosmology and I would like to talk about funding. It's something that always bothered me about science and something that also seems very important, but oddly we never speak about it in school.

So here are some of my questions for cosmologists (or people working on that area):

How do you get money for your research ? (not very original I know)

Who gives the money and why ? Is it just for the sake of research or is there an agenda ? (even if I really don't see what it could be) 

Do you have some kind of requirements to fullfill for keeping your funding ?

There is more but I think you get the general idea.


Off topic:While writing this I thought about how scientists seems to work together regardless of what nationality they are or what country they come from and I wanted to ask, is this true for cosmologists ? Are you working with cosmologist of other nationalies ? And if yes, how does it work and what are doing exactly with them ?

I really hope you can answer my questions and thanks anyway if you can't.

1349299804.0	10wbvk	Is there an acceptable theory connecting cosmology to quantum causal relations?	secretlyMIA	13	7	6	"In light of [this article](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-10/uov-qcr100212.php), I was wondering if a theory exists that connects this concept to cosmology. (And if one does exist, whether it has been discredited.)

If the theory on causal relations in this article is sound, it would make sense that, given the Big Crunch theory, the ending of the universe could trigger its own beginning, because the beginning (Big Bang) and end (Big Crunch) would both be on a scale at which quantum mechanics would apply. This could possibly answer the question of the universe's origins—the eternal question of, Well, if the universe hasn't always been here, what was here before it? and what caused it to happen?

I'm just a college junior with 2 years of astronomy and physics classes' worth of knowledge, but this is a thing I've been pondering for a while. If this is totally crackpot-sounding and stupid, please tell me; I'd definitely like to know the rationale behind why such a theory could be dismissed.

This would be the universal acceleration of time where, just for example, 1 second a billion years ago now passes in something like 10 seconds.

Closing down these telescopes would be a huge loss for the scientific community!

Not only the instrument itself but it would mean less access for astronomers and the loss of a great educational center.

Here's a few random facts about the Green Bank Telescope:

*No other telescope covers, with the sensitivity of the GBT, frequencies as low or as high in the radio spectrum. Without the GBT, certain windows to the universe will be closed.

*No other telescope can both find and time millisecond pulsars, a pursuit which could lead to the detection of gravitational waves (and, probably, the Nobel Prize).

*No other telescope can match the GBT’s sensitivity to the faint spectral lines of molecules in space, including complex organic ones that are necessary for the development of life.

*The kinds of results that come out of single-dish radio telescopes will come out of telescopes in other countries, such as Germany, Australia, and Great Britain. The US will have greatly reduced its scientific competitiveness in this arena.

*The Green Bank Telescope site hosts numerous educational programs, including the West Virginia Governor's School for Math and Science, the Pulsar Search Collaboratory, the Radio Astronomer for a Day program, field trip experiences, and conferences such as StarQuest and the Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers. These programs give students, teachers, and regular-old adults the tools to explore the universe, and they affect thousands of people each year.

*600 astronomers put in proposals to use the GBT last year. Given that there are only about 10,000 astronomers total in the world, that's a big chunk of the community.

*If the observatory is non-federally funded, or if it is not funded at all and astronomers turn to other telescopes, the observatory and/or those telescopes will not have an ""open skies"" policy. ""Open skies"" means that anyone can apply to use the telescopes, and the only thing between you and the control room is the scientific merit of your proposal. In other countries, and on privately funded telescopes, the sky is not so open, and time is often based on affiliation or citizenship.

Other Cool Facts,The Green Bank Telescope:

*Can record up to 800 Megabytes of data every second, the equivalent of 17 laptop hard-drives every hour
*Provides astronomers all over the world with almost 7,000 hours of observing time each year
*Used radar signals sent from Puerto Rico and bounced off the moon to examine  the Moon’s surface
*Helped NASA track the Phoenix Mars Lander to make sure its landing was going as planned.
*Can detect signals from the beginning of the universe, some of which are only 0.000000000000000000000000000000001 times as powerful as a regular light bulb.
*Is the largest fully steerable telescope in the world
*Is 485 feet tall, almost exactly the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza
*Its dish Is 328 feet by 360 feet across
*Could readily fit two football fields inside its dish"	t5_2r5v1	True

Increasing distance would not directly cause receding objects to increase in velocity, but if you think of gravity as a kind of 'brake' or resistance to expansion; then if the force of expansion remains constant (which it would) while the resistance decreases over time; wouldn't we see this as a gradual increase in the velocity of expansion?"	t5_2r5v1	True

What if we look at time from the other direction? What if we see the movement of time as a sequence of events, collisions of particles and probability wave decoherence? Rather than some fundamental axis of the universe, it's merely a human explanation of event and force elasticity.

I'm suggesting that time on a universe-wide scale is really just a measure of the frequency of events. The number of ""events"" in a given space-time locality will directly influence the apparent timespeed of that area, which would impact the four forces as well apparent momentum and mass. That events create time, and thus fewer events mean slower relative time.

Does this make any sense whatsoever? I'm guessing the answer is 'no.' 

But if not, this could have the potential to impact a lot of things. The extreme inflationary period immediately following the big-bang, why that inflation slowed, and perhaps the root of the cosmological constant and the mystery of dark matter and energy.

Surely it is just a likely that the body that is now the Earth was the object that came into the inner solar system? This might explain a lot. The reason the material is very different on the moon is because it is the remants of the body the Earth hit. The large amount of water on Earth might be explained by the idea that it was a Kuiper Belt body similar to Neptune, with a rocky core.

I took an astronomy class on cosmology this year in college and found out how interesting it is. So that's about my level of understanding. 

My question is this: I understand that space expanded from the astronomically small singularity at the start of the Big Bang at an incredibly fast speed, seeing as the universe was so much smaller at the time. I understand that the inflationary theory fixed the holes in the BBT but I still am confused as to tracing back what came from what.

For example: the universe -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; Gases and ""stuff""   -&gt; Singularity of expansion -&gt; ?

You see my question? What allowed the Singularity to form if there was nothing there to begin with?

My [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cosmology/comments/11nlwu/im_writing_a_science_fiction_novel_i_need_your/) here was in some ways a success but in other ways it raised more questions for me to handle while writing my science fiction story. Here is a set of scenarios I'm working on, and I need you guys to help me create the ""fluff"" for these actions and happenings so that they *kinda* make sense from a science perspective. As will be obvious, an exact match is impossible. I just don't want reading it to be like chewing on gravel for people who know a bit of science. 


First off, character A on earth wants to build a spaceship to colonize a different planet. She hires cosmologists. While in the planning phase, an article shows up in a cosmology journal, written by character B, which revolutionizes the field in a contested, bitter sort of way. This article isn't signed, nobody knows who wrote it (character B is in a mental institution. He is a genius with a genetic mutation, providing him with a sixth sense (seeing space-time curvature, maybe?) and crazy-person mannerisms). 

The article shows a) that the universe is going to *crunch*, and perhaps sooner than would be expected (say 2 billion years from now or something) and b) how to build a really fancy spaceship capable of surviving said crunch and also escaping the gravity well on earth. It also needs to be able to power itself indefinitely, because it's going past the crunch and then it needs to be operational for a good while longer.

The article prompts a change of plans for A, who then decides to skip the colony mission and instead try to save the human race from certain doom by surviving the crunch. My current thinking for how this will be achieved will be to create a tiny bubble universe for the ship to inhabit. This needs to be doable from the ship. I'm thinking fancy machine built by character B. If this *same* machine could somehow get the ship out of the gravity well on earth, that would be extra good, because then B could've tricked A into building it before she even wanted to try and survive the crunch in the first place, just by describing it as a ""start engine"" in his article.  

It would also be good if there was a sciencey reason for why Character A and her staff believe that the article tells them everything they need to know to build the spaceship, but that turns out not to be the case and they have to find B and break him out of the mental institution. 

I would love to have some help with filling in the science details here, without having to change these core parts of the story. Thank you all for your help last time around, and I look forward to reading your suggestions!

Bullet point questions:


**What does the article need to do to demonstrate that the universe will crunch, and soon?**



**What kind of spaceship will it be? Will it have like an alcubierre engine? The story does not require faster than light travel, in fact it would be better if that was still impossible in my story**



**If a machine could bend spacetime sort of willy-nilly, could it then manipulate gravity so as to use it as an engine? So the earth pulls the spaceship down, and the spaceship machine curves spacetime around itself so that it is instead pulled *up*? I think that would be cool, but I don't currently posess the language to write it nor the know-how to write it *well*.**

Not sure if there is anything here. Let me know what you think. When I read the wikipedia article about the Banach-Tarski paradox, this thought just kind of came to me.

Could the Banach-Tarski paradox have anything  to do with the structure of electrons or bosons, quarks maybe?

Perhaps the wave like action of sub-atomic particles could be represented by the creation and  annihilation of pseudo-particle and anti-particle pairs.  If their alignment were during their action were that of a paradoxical decomposition set, but while comprising the structure of particles we understand as being part of matter.

Can rotating paradoxical decomposing sets [PDS] be what  comprise electrons or other bosons? If so, could the  Banach-Tarski paradox account for Dark energy and Dark  matter?

Is it possible that the action of the annihilating pseudo- particles arranged in a rotating paradoxical decomposing  set acts on space in such a way that it drags space along  and leaves us with 2 quanta of space when before there was  1? 

If so then the expansion of the universe could be explained  by this. Might the action of [PDS] leave exponentially smaller  and smaller [PDS] the further the distance from the  originating set. This could account for Dark Energy, the accelerating expansion of the universe. 

If mass were to act on this new space, as it does on what we might refer to as old space, then the originating matter would continuously fall back together to the center of these  clouds of new space exhaust. Around a spiral galaxy, gravity would act on this space, as it does, and leave it twisted  as the matter at it's center rotates around the host  galaxy's black hole. Might this twisted space actually affect our measurements through it and may account  for dark matter. 

An example of dark matter acting like a galactic exhaust  cloud may be see in Abell 520 which is a merger of galaxy  clusters. Measurements in 2007 showed the the dark matter  clouds of the merging clusters to be traveling independently  of their respective hosts. I would picture this similarly  to 2 cars with smokey exhausts colliding. Their exhaust  clouds would continue to move and pass through each other  as the the cars hit.

With nothing else in existance both infinetly small and infinetly large would exist and every spectrum in btwn. Also infinetly dense and infetly light with every spectrum would also have to exist because the ""singular"" must also be the ""everything"". If we hold that nothing in our hand and split it in half (haven't worked out why yet, sothing to do with a wobble effect or unbalance, there may be multiple nothings) nothing now becomes 2 and just become self aware of something other than itself. holding the two nothings apart because they are two we now have just created distance, speed and time, beginning with nothing! Now these nothings keep splitting, sometimes grouping back up with other ""after nothings"" and this imbalance in numbers begins the everything we see today.
Lets pause and think before the big bang, before infinetly anything to nothing. If nothing were to ""exist"" everything must also exist but this isn't evident in models. Nothing IS everything when there is nothing to compare nothing to. It is ALL because there is nothing, with nothing there is nothing nothing can be less than (also nothing nothing can be more than for it is everything). So enough of the rambling this is only a draft of a theory. In nothing existance nothing can be seen as opposites. Take zero, zero does not exist. If you take a number line both positive and negative, zero is always the combination of two identical opposite together. Image taking 1 and -1 and slamming them together to make zero. We would say there is nothing, but we can rip zero apart and now we have 1 and -1 again. Because numbers go on forever, we can do this forever or infinitley positive and infinetly negative. When combined we always ""see"" zero but we now know that zero or nothing is the combination of everything. Nothing is the cancelation of two everythings. 
Now this is a working thesis so instead of trashing it please help to refine it. The key questions are the split of this nothings. Please also take into accont the obsertity of infinitely small and dense, there is just no such thing. Why do we hold on to such an unflassible notion?
