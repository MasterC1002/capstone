The hospitality of our fellow Minnesotans have been amazing.My family and I moved around to different locations within Minneapolis over the years.However, despite the Minnesota niceness, I always find it interesting when my friends open up about concerns about the Somali community and questions they feel its too sensitive or un-appropriate to ask which prompted me to do this on Reddit. So Fire away, and lets have some fun.

1352097359.0	12nn0y	**Important Voting Information**	lilith480	85	19	26	"* **Where do I go to vote?  What will I be voting on?**

Go to [this link](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/Default.aspx) to find out where your polling place is, and to see exactly what your ballot will look like.

* **I'm not registered to vote, can I still vote?**

YES!  Use the link above to find your polling place, and show up there on election day (between 7am and 8pm) with the following items:

a. Photo ID (if your current address is on this ID, this is all you need)

b. If address on ID is different from current address, bring the ID and a document with **your name** and your **current address** (such as a utility bill, pay stub, etc) from the **past 30 days**; if you get online bills, just print one out, or bring your laptop/smartphone

* **I just moved/I don't pay any utilities/none of the bills are in my name, what do I do?**

Bring someone else with you who lives in your precinct and is registered to vote.  They can vouch for you that you live where you say you do.  If they're not registered but they do have proof of their residency, have them register first, then vouch for you.

* **I want to vote but I can't walk/drive to my polling place**

No problem!  You can sign up for a free ride to the polls, and someone will pick you up at whatever time you want.  There are several organizations who will do this.  One of them is Minnesotans United, and if you call **800-801-9286**, they will sign you up for a ride.

***

Now for the personal appeal:

Voting is a very important civic duty, and regardless of who/what you vote for, I hope that you and everyone you know will go out and exercise your civil rights.  That said, it would personally mean a lot to me if you vote NO on the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment.  Here are some reasons why they matter to me:

**Voter ID**

1. The amendment is written very poorly.  It doesn't account for a lot of unintended consequences.

2. Unlike voter ID measures in almost every other state that has them, the writers of this amendment didn't make any exceptions for active military personnel or the very elderly who no longer have birth certificates.

3. No other state with voter ID laws has same-day voter registration. Election officials have said that the law, as currently written, would force same-day registration to end.

4. Unlike other states, the way the law is currently written would not allow students from non-state schools in Minnesota to use their student IDs.

5. The amendment, as currently written, is estimated to cost the state $30-50 million.  The state will have to pay for it by increasing property taxes.

6. Once it's in the constitution as currently written, it can't be changed, even if the legislature realizes that is has some unintended consequences; they will be forced to enact those laws because the constitution is the highest law; therefore, we should send it back to the legislature and make them rewrite it, and decide **beforehand** how they plan to enforce the law, so they don't force us to vote on something without first knowing all of the consequences.

**Marriage Amendment**

1. No one would want to be told it's illegal to marry the person they love

2. Gays and lesbians will always be in the minority; therefore, it's up to everyone, especially straight people, to stand up for and protect their rights

3. No single religion should be held above others and put into law, especially not the Constitution. Many religions, such as 3 of the 4 Jewish Movements (including mine), 5 of the 6 Minnesota Lutheran synods, many Baptists, Episcopalians, Anglicans, Quakers, Unitarians, and others, have same-sex marriage.  We shouldn't be discriminating against those religions.

4. The polls show that the vote is 50-50.  Whether the amendment is defeated will come down to how many people show up on election day. **You could be that 1 vote that makes the difference** (think of Al Franken's election)! How empowering is that???

***

Thank you all!  Please pass on all the information about how to vote to your friends.  This is a really important election and it's really important that you actually go out and vote!  I'm happy to answer any questions about how to vote if anyone is still not sure.

my black shoulder style laptop bag with a black guitar strap for a strap containing my 2011 15"" MacBook Pro, Sony DJ Studio Monitor headphones, 1 TB Seagate external hard drive (with all my backups on it... i know i know.. i didn't realize i had it), a couple books and my wallet all got stolen from the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis, MN Saturday Sept 29th at around noon. they tried to use my debit card at a St. Paul Holiday gas station. working with the Minneapolis police but I'm relying on you all to keep your eyes out and send suggestions. I have the ""Find my Mac"" turned on so the moment they log onto wifi they're caught, but they haven't logged on yet. we're pulling surveillance footage from the gas stations so hopefully we can hunt them down. I'm constantly checking Craigslist and other outlets.


all of my music, demos, lyrics, rough ideas, video (50 GIGS from in studio footage) and everything else that is digital and important in my life is in that bag.. i'm offering a $1,200 reward for the fucker because I just want my stuff back. if it's you WAY TO GO you're gonna get paid. I don't even care to press charges I just need it back. I WILL PAY YOU... just return it and I will even mail you the $ to a PO box.. or we can make an exchange in person. please, sir, madaam... don't ruin my life. ♥

Problem is between getting out of the homeless (At 6 AM) and the time the youthlink center opens up (9AM) I have no choice but to loiter around a local bussiness, which is something I'd much rather not do.

I was blown away how active everyone seemed to be, and the number of bikes everywhere was incredible. We spent a lot of time riding the rentable green bikes around and then riding bikes around the city. Also did the running tour of breweries and bars, which was great. Great cheese curds, absolutely loved that they squeaked as they were eaten. We ordered a pitcher of Jack and coke at a bar. A pitcher! That's not legal in Texas I don't think, but it was great.

* Always lock when left unattended:
I can't remember where I read this but apparently the vast majority of bike theft is *opportunistic*. That is, someone leaves the bike alone for two minutes to go get some coffee then goes back outside to find the bike isn't there anymore. I've seen plenty of people do it all around town and while they might justify it by saying ""It was a piece of shit bike, I'll just get another"", you can't really say that when the bike was expensive, had sentimental value, is your only owned means of transportation, or had all three properties at once.

* Lock both frame and wheels:
A nice u-lock for the frame is basic now, but having a cable, cable lock or another u-lock for the front wheel really helps when you have to leave the bike outside. If you have quick-release wheels, it's a must to lock both wheels. How many bikes have you seen without their front wheel? I've seen many.

* Lock in a visible place: That is, somewhere people are around and where someone might say something if a lock is being cut or a wheel removed. Some places hide their racks 'to avoid an eyesore' but really, that just makes it easier for a thief to do his thing.

* Don't fucking buy a bike from some dude in a street corner. You know it's stolen.

A really determined thief will always get the bike he wants, specially at night. If you can, always bring your ride indoors for the night. You might complain about carrying it three floors up, but you know no one is going to take it while you sleep. If you must leave it outside, don't use a puny 4-digit combination lock that anyone can pull on. Use a lock you could brain someone with, along with another, lighter one for the front wheel.

If you really care about your bike, you could try using [SpyBike](http://www.integratedtrackers.com/GPSTrack/) or [BikeSpike](http://bikespike.com/)."	t5_2r3bl	True

Holy. Fucking. Shit. This god damned road construction on University is getting old, really quick. After 2+ months of solid jackhammer noise and construction nonsense, they FINALLY finished the sidewalk and infrastructure improvements. No more waking up at 7:00am against my will due to excessive noise. All is well in the world.

NOPE.

Motherfucks are back at it again. Apparently, a few small standing puddles near the sidewalk corners are unacceptable, and they are spending thousands of dollars to tear up the sidewalk they *just* poured a week or two ago. Not to mention pouring asphalt **between 12am and 2am on weeknights** with loud construction noises waking up neighbors... it just won't end.

I mainly work from home, so I've had to put up with this shit all day every day this summer. It's especially painful because they begin working at 7:00am sharp and have no fucking mercy. Jackhammers at full force, with no regard to the neighbors. Anyone else sharing this pain?

Video example taken a few minutes ago of the shit I have to deal with all fucking day: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bSuOYpybtk

Sorry for the rant.

So, they installed fiber in my entire building (south MPLS). It's pretty awesome. There's just an ethernet jack in the wall. That's it.

When I finally decided to cut the cord on Comcast (praise Jah!) it was literally less than half-an-hour before my new connection was up. It's fast as hell. I do the $30/month option for 30 Mb up(!!!)/down. The plans go up to 1Gb. That's insane.

Also, and I think this is the most important part, I have had the best customer service experience of my life with this company. You call, you get to talk to a human right away and they actually know what they're talking about. I have a background in IT/programming. I tell them that and they instantly go into expert nerd mode and everything is fixed incredibly quickly.

I can't recommend them highly enough."	t5_2r3bl	True

I've already checked the impound lot's website and called the police (it's been an hour and a half and they still haven't shown up, so I figured I'd make this post in the meantime). 

My car is a dark red 1997 Honda Accord 4 door with a rear spoiler [(stock photo without spoiler)](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/vehicle-pictures/1997/honda/accord/96802041990217-480.jpg). If any of you could keep an eye out for it, I'd really appreciate it. I have some personally meaningful books and CDs in the car, as well as both of my yoga mats. 

It was stolen not far from [this intersection](http://goo.gl/maps/IDrNn), sometime between 8:30pm last night and 6 pm today, which was when I first noticed it was missing. Any help or suggestions you can give would be really appreciated. 

**UPDATE** - Got a call this morning saying it was found at the St. Paul impound lot, and that it's stripped and isn't driveable. Wish I could find the people that did this and turn them in so they couldn't do this to anyone else. I appreciate everyone who took the time to upvote or comment. Thanks for all the help and support.

I'm looking to start a team in the Kenwood Park Kickball league.  I played tennis at Kenwood Park a lot last spring and noticed that there were some sweet kickball games going on.  There's gotta be somebody here who is in that league.  I couldn't find much when I googled it.  

EDIT: ding ding! i found my answer!  quoth morganbird: If it's Tuesday or Wednesday night I'm 95% sure it's a pickup game. I sometimes play in a pickup game at Painter Park and sorta know a few people in the Kenwood game. You can probably just go introduce yourself and ask to play with them if you want to.

EDIT 2: The-Cure says:The Painter Park League starts Wed. April 25th, at 6pm. They meet every Wednesday until July 18th. There are other Leagues for every other night of the week, but they play in various parks near Painter Park (Bryn Mawr Meadows, Northeast Park, Bossen, and a few others). If everyone wants to start a team, lets figure out what night would be best. They are all co-ed 18+ Adult League, 10-20 team members (equal ratio of men/women mus be fielded at all times). Fees are $395 for the season. That's 12 regular season games and maybe potential for playoffs. Registration begins in 1 week, Feb 19th. 

EDIT 3:auriolrd says:**Hello! I am a weekly player in the Tuesday night kickball game. It is 100% a pick up game and open to anybody who wants to play. We're very loosely organized but announcements on when in the year we're going to start playing are done via our Facebook group page. PM me your Facebook info and I will invite you to the group!**

Hope you are just as nerdy as I am and loves to hang with cool people cause me and my cat are looking for you!!! lets chat it up! Go out for a drink or two and see if we click!!! 

BTW if you have a boyfriend as well, but not looking for him to move in as well, that wouldbe awesome, too!!!! 

**edit:** After some reevaluating I have noticed where I went wrong in a step here. My boyfriend is not comfortable with me living with single men. Its not a me thing. I am generally really reasonable, but I do not wish to go against his wishes. I also dont talk about him all the time. I talk more about my cat (dont even get me started!) and no, I am not a crazy cat lady. She is the first pet I have ever had on my own and I am just very proud of her and love het to bits.

I am moving to your city in a few weeks. My apartment is located in Uptown, in the Lowry Hill area. I have been reading about the public wifi available in Minneapolis and, as someone who spends too much time on the internet, am a bit concerned about having super slow internet all year. 

I know it varies by location and people probably have varied experiences, but I was hoping to learn a little more about it and what the people of Minneapolis really think about the public wifi system and how effective it really is. I'd also like to hear from anyone who is using something different for their internet service. I'll continue to do my own research but I thought I could get some valuable input from you guys.


Also, if anyone knows how I can figure out what the average electric bill would be for my future apartment, I'd really appreciate it.

One of my friends had a bit too much to drink and so two of my other friends were helping her while I went to find a taxi.  For full disclosure, they are all females and I am a male.

They stood back by the building while I ventured towards the street to try and hail a cab.  After about four minutes I wasn't having any luck, but continued to raise my hand in the air as cars came by.  I was standing fairly close to the curb when a police officer came up to me from my blind spot, telling me I needed to get out of the street.  I explained that I was trying to hail a cab and pointed to my feet, which were not even a foot away from the curb.  

At that point the police officer seemed to snap and pushed me full force with both of his hands on my chest.  I staggered backwards, now fully on the sidewalk and said ""Ok, I'm off the street...sorry,"" expecting that this would be the end of our interaction.  He proceeded to push me 3-4 more times, with the same amount of force and didn't say a word.  He pushed me until I was knocked down into a potted plant near the building side of the sidewalk.  I had no idea what was going on and tried to continue walking backwards but then he took me around the chest and another officer grabbed my feet and they pushed me to the ground.  I was then arrested and the rest of my story truly doesn't matter here.

I'm reaching out to r/minneapolis because my friends told me that they saw people with their cameras and phones out, either taking video or pictures of the incident.  I realize it is a crazy stretch to think anyone who sees this will either be one of those people or know them, but it is worth it because if there is any evidence that the cop was behaving unjustly then it is far more likely I can have the arrest and the charges dropped from my record.  So please, if you were around the Depot/First Ave at about 1:30-2:00 AM Sunday morning or know someone who was, I would greatly appreciate any help you can give me.

Woo hoo!!  

UPDATE:   
I just talked to her to ask what the scoop was and she replied: ""I staked out in the bushes for 40 minutes this morning, chased the guy down and asked him to unlock it. He did! Apparently he bought it off an acquaintance. i have it back""   
so there you have it. KARMA BITCHES!

This summer there's a 99% chance that my family and I will be staying in your beautiful city for a couple of months. I've lived in Minneapolis before for five whole years. Each year we lived in a New House, so I've been in a few different neighborhoods including Kingsville, Kenny, Diamond Lake. Still, they were all still in the same general area. Not to mention I was ages 6-11, so the only places I visited were the creek, Lake Harriet, Southdale Mall, Kenny Park and (on very special occasions) the Malt Shop. I'm still a young'n (15), but this summer I would like to explore more of your amazing city. My plans so far are to take the bus in to the city and explore, try and see some good concerts, and just bike around a lot. I will be visiting a lot with my friend, who's lived there since she was two, but she's kind of a hermit. Anyways, I'm sure I'm just giving a lot of meaningless information, so here's my point. If you could suggest some places to visit (music venues, shops, whatever) that are easy to attend and relatively friendly for my age, I would very much appreciate it. My brother played in a high school band when we lived here and he played at the Twin Cities Underground a lot, but I can't seem to find anything on it online. If you also know of another site that I could find more info, that would be great. Thanks!

I left the city of lakes four years ago to live and work in the NE of China, where the winters make Minnesota seem like the Bahamas. Next month I'm finally coming back, and am curious about some of the changes that have gone on since I left in the summer of 08.

I've been back a couple of times, and check Startrib's website every once and awhile, so I'm not completely out of the loop.

**What I know**

* The New Twins stadium looks awesome, can't wait to see a game there. 

* The Shubert is no longer a blemish on Hennepin avenue.

* Surley beer has become very popular. 

* Minneapolis is going to allow mixed recycling soon ( Fuck Yes!)

* The Dinkytowner closed its doors.

* Light rail lines are expanding.

* I notice Minneapolis has basically no traffic, I was able to make it from downtown Minneapolis to St. Paul in about a half hour during rush hour.  Is this normal?  I am from Seattle and used to huge traffic jams.

* What is it like when it snows?  Do roads and things get cleared fast?  Would you ever stay home from work because of expected snow, or is the city and infrastructure just well geared to handle snowfall?  Do people ever get stuck at work?

* When is the best weather?  Also are there any times where it's like 50 degrees, sunny and dry?  Or is that really rare?  

* What are some neat neighborhoods to live in?  I spent some time driving around Uptown last time I was there, and it looked a little...bland perhaps?  Not particularly lively?  I do love all the outdoor cafes downtown though.  When I was there they weren't hopping, but I would guess in summer they get crowded?

I'm going to be moving to Minneapolis in August for work.  I am going to be working downtown on Nicollet Mall.  I'd like to find an apartment in the downtown area, within walking distance of Nicollet Mall so that I can walk to work - preferably it would be a complex that is connected to the skyway system.

Anyone have any suggestions?  I'm looking for something somewhat affordable, around 1k/month or less for a 1 bedroom.

Thanks for the help!

I would love some advice and tips!	luminouslylurid	21	7	44	"I'm from Montana, (the south eastern region) we get a bit of snow but not nearly what you guys have. I'm really excited to move, and I just have so many questions. If any of you want to answer them here or be my official Minneapolis/Minnesota chat buddy that would be great!

Note: I'm sorry if some of my questions seem stupid. I'm from Billings, which while it is the biggest city in MT, is still rather small. I've never lived in a big city before, so just be patient with me. Thanks!

Some of my questions:

I sort of want to leave my car behind in Montana. Is just having a bike a good idea? 

What areas of town should I absolutely avoid?

How many parkas should I bring?

Where are the best places to fish (near town) and where can I learn to ice fish?

What restaurants do you recommend for delicious, (preferably locally owned) cheap college food?

What is the sales tax like there? I've never lived in a state with sales tax before. 

What are some fun things to do for those of us who don't turn 21 until October?

Do you guys have an Asian market? If so, where?



That's about all for now. Like I said, let me know if you wanna be my chat buddy before I get over there. I would love to have someone to talk to rather than just be alone and awkward. And for your guidance (unless you plan on raping me) I will buy you a coffee/tea when I finally arrive.

Recently accepted into UofM for a masters program.  My girlfriend will be relocating with me.  She works in retail and expects to transfer into the Mall of America.  We have two dogs and two chinchillas.  We currently pay $1500/mo rent but are hoping to decrease this either with a roommate or lower cost of living than where we are now.  I drive and have a car.  She does not and relies purely on walking and public transportation.  The public transportation here is limited to a fairly basic bus network with one hub.  We aren't big drinkers/party scene people so we don't need to be near the bars.  We can get there for the rare times we go out for that.

So, first question...where should we look to live?  We would really like to rent another house, as we have for several years, and have grown attached to amenities like a garage (I have a small wood shop), a yard for the dogs, and our own laundry.  I don't mind driving to school (unless public trans is cheaper/easier) but I want to ensure she has the easiest possible commute without multiple bus transfers.

Driving in the Twin Cities - I've only been to Boston and NYC.  A car is mainly a hindrance in both of these cities.  It's almost impossible to park, costs a ton to park when you do, and most rentals offer no parking.  Is it similar in the TC?  It will be difficult to adjust to a life where I can't even drive to the grocery store or a restaurant because there is no real parking offered anywhere.  Should I begin to prepare to scale down my driving?

I know it is really general but what can I expect to be drastically different than living in a city of 43k in New England?

I am going on a trip to the Bahamas with my girlfriend and her parents at the end of October. Due to several reasons I have to take a different flight than them, which leaves me stranded in Minneapolis from 7PM until 9AM.

My budget is rather tight (almost next to nothing, sadly) and I was wondering if I could get any tips/advice on things I could possibly do at night/any hostel recommendations whatsoever. I am also wondering if it's a ""safe"" city, as in not having to worry about being mugged whatsoever if I walk around at night. I'm asking this because I am still not sure what I am going to do. I could book a room but that's spending money and I don't think I will be returning to Minneapolis any time soon, so might as well make it worthwhile :)


I would really appreciate it! Really looking forward to seeing this city as well, even though it's only for a couple of hours:)

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT** woops I apologize, quickly made this post before I went out with my dog:)

I'm a 23 year old male and I study tourism (I suppose that means I should know more about Minneapolis haha). I'll be in Minneapolis from 7PM (Saturday) until 9AM (Sunday) which I suppose means I won't be able to do any museums whatsoever. My interests are pretty varied but seeing how I'm sort of limited by the time (night) I was thinking of just walking around a bit, enjoying scenery and have a few drinks at a bar/several bars, hopefully striking up conversations with local people, which is my favorite thing to do while travelling:)"	t5_2r3bl	True

I have noticed several places around here are guarded like a well kept secret! I just want to help others by letting them know about some of these places! Some of them have taken me two years to find!

The Camden Promise Food Shelf is through the Gethsemane Lutheran Church and meets the 1st and 3rd Saturday of each month. The church also hosts Angel Food Ministries so you can order food packages to be picked up there, and they accept EBT as payment.

Pastor Paul's Mission is a great foodshelf they give some bulk items, and produce! Plus they have Items that you can buy for super cheap (squash, zuccinic, green peppers, it varies) and have a meal club you can join, not to mention a clothes closet. They are located at 1000 Oliver Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55411

There is also a foodbank from the Salvation Army at 2024 Lyndale Ave. N, Minneapolis, MN 55411 phone (612) 522-4871 Mon - Fri at 2 different time slots per day. Get there early they run out fast!

Also I want to mention Loaves and Fishes There are several locations throughout the Metro area that serve  meals, no questions asked mon-fri from 5:30 - 6:30

Here is a list of more places

http://grovelandfoodshelf.org/

http://www.emergencyfoodshelf.org/

Second Harvest Food Bank, 8405 10th Ave N, Minneapolis, MN 55427, (763) 593-2712

http://shutdownriseup.org/ Is providing meals in the evenings during the goverment shutdown.

There are several Churchs that give out free bread anytime no questions asked, I can't recall the names but I will research it and post them when I find out.

http://www.sharingandcaringhands.org/ also gives out meals daily, even breakfast!

I have heard that http://houseofcharity.org/?page_id=75 gives out mid-day meals to all even on weekends which is rare!

There are also 2 places probably more, but 2 that I know of where you can buy discounted food. Fare For All and Greater Lake Country Food Bank

http://sisterscamelot.org/ is another place to check out.

So, two years ago at the age of 86, my grandpa rode his bike to the library to renew some books.  He skidded on a patch of gravel and fell around the corner from his house, and died in the hospital the next day.

So this past weekend, when I was in town to visit the extended family that still lives in Minneapolis, I made/put up a ghost bike at the corner of his accident (28 west and W Lake of the Isles Parkway).  I left a phone message with the Lake of the Isles Park Board, and emailed the manager, Amy Olson, explaining what the memorial was and why it was there.  I haven't heard back from anyone.

That was Tuesday morning.  Now, on Thursday, at 10:00, I just got off the phone with my widowed grandmother, Libby, who just called to tell me she drove by the spot and the ghost bike memorial had been taken down.  I'm not sure if it was stolen or cut down by the city, but my hunch is that it was the city.  Is there any way that you folks know of to make a formal complaint, or to officially register this ghost bike with the city?  I've seen some others around that have been there for a while without being taken.

I heard a bang and a woman scream ""Oh My God, Oh My god."" My first thought was that a person had jumped off their balcony. I walked outside onto mine a minute or two later but didn't see anything obviously amiss so I returned indoors. About five minutes later, several police cars pulled up outside the building along with a fire truck parked along Marquette. I went back out at the sound of the sirens and saw police tape cordoning off an area in front of the building and officers milling around. Shortly after, I went to bed and the only evidence online of the incident that I've been able to find is here (see Trauma Alert):

I would have thought that at least one of the banal news outlets covering the twin cities (KARE, FOX 9 etc.) would have a write up on an incident like this but I haven't been able to find anything at all. 

Does anyone know what actually happened or how to find out? Why is there zero coverage when many news outlets around here cover every seemingly minor car accident?

It was a haunting event to experience, even aurally, and I'd like to know what really happened.

I write for a travel website (www.travelrinserepeat.com) and I'm working on an article about visiting cities virtually by listening to the bands that best capture the sound of said cities. I have chosen Minneapolis as one of the five cities I want to profile in the article, and I want YOUR input on what bands I should consider including.

I'm looking to feature a local band (not a large national act that came out of Minneapolis), that is active now (still making music and playing shows throughout town), and that best represents the sound of the city.

I know there are a lot of passionate opinions on music, so I'm looking forward to the discussion!

Thanks in advance for your help and I'll post the article back here when I'm all done with it.

I currently live in Baton Rouge, LA but my girlfriend is from Minnetonka.  She has an interview for a job in Minneapolis (not sure where exactly) that she seems to be pretty much a lock for.  Now, the issue is that I can't go with her unless I find a real job to go to (ie something kinda in my field).

So, I turn to you /r/Minneapolis.  I have never lived in the Twin Cities area and don't really know where to start. I've done the typical poking around on the mass job boards and a couple more specific ones but haven't seen much.  I was wondering if anyone here could help point me in the right direction.

A little about me.  I have two B.S.'s in Environmental Science and Zoology from Oho State.  My background is more specifically with wetlands/aquatic systems and   I have worked at two research centers giving tours, working with the education programs, and being an all-around handyman.  I have also worked as a field assistant with the USGS and as a intern drone for the Ecological Society of America.  I currently work as a Dog Trainer.

Any help anyone could give me would be absolutely fantastic.  Thanks!

I'm going to be leaving nola and visiting your fair city during my Mardi Gras break this coming week/end. While I am extremely excited to be seeing a college-friend after years of distance, I'm a little sad to be missing out on shenanigans back home. 

I was wondering if there's anything going on in Minneapolis (St. Paul?) for Fat Tuesday? Or if there are any New Orleanian things I could do as a gesture. My friend is going to be working during the day, so I'd like to find things to occupy myself with next Tuesday.

Are there any good bakeries with King Cake (or beignets)? 

Are there any bars that serve Ramos Gin Fizz? (I know, not as New Orleanian as the Sazerac... but I don't like whiskey.)

Are there any restaurants that serve gumbo or boudin?

At the very least, does anyone have bar recommendations for day drinking? I'm a cocktail-drinker, not beer, so I'd imagine in other cities it'll be harder to find a casual daytime joint where I can read a book and slowly work myself toward intoxication.

Primarily, I don't want to deal with crappy loud neighbors and things like that (i've had a lot of issues with noise and trashy neighbors, but probably a result of me slumming it which leads to undesirables moving in).

Anyone, if anyone has lived somewhere particularly nice or knows firsthand about any particularly nice apartments, please let me know.

My wife just matched an Hematology/Oncology fellowship with the U of M Medical Center and will be starting her training there in July.  We're going to be living apart to start out with so I'm trying to start searching for apartments for her (and me when I visit).


I'm basically looking for some advice on good neighborhoods or apartments to narrow my search a little bit.  Ideally we want to get her as close to the medical campus as possible.  She is currently accustomed to a 15 minute highway commute and doesn't want to go any further than that.  I've noticed that most of the really close apartments seem geared towards college students and that is something we'd like to avoid.

I have a beautiful older, male, neutered, de-clawed, long furred, soft grayish cat named Sydney. He is very laid back and likes to nap a lot. Seeks out attention when he would like some love but he is never pushy or annoying about it. Not a big meow-er, unless you are opening a can of wet food for him and then he is very encouraging. 

I have had this cat since he was a kitten; he is just the most amazing cat and is so important to my family! We are in a bad situation and cannot have him at the hotel with us. My brother was caring for him but is now moving to a place he can’t take Sydney. We literally have until the end of this week (28th of October) to find someone to watch him for us while we try to find an apartment. I hate to have to do this but I am afraid that if I can’t find a temporary home he will end up in a shelter that will put him down because he is old. This would be devastating. 

Please if you love cats, help me keep mine safe! He is such a good boy; he blends in like he belongs. He is just the right mix of independence and snuggle. And his fur is SOOO soft. He loves being brushed. He is a purr box, and will purr you to sleep if you want. For more information please message me.

The issue I've found myself in is that he's always been an indoor and outdoor cat and, apparently, has recently started visiting my neighbor who happens to be deathly allergic to cats. My neighbor wound up going to the ER a couple nights ago because of exposure to my cat and the doctor says that if she had waited too much longer she probably would have died.

Over the last couple of days my wife and I have been keeping Cosmos indoors, but he's been very vocal about not wanting to stay in the house. My wife also suspects that he peed on one of our blankets. I know these aren't the best selling points, but I assure you he's a good cat who just wants to go outside.

I feel like I'm a special case.  I've been to Minneapolis for a sum total of less than 24 hours in my life.  I flew in one evening for a job interview, and flew out the next day.  It's too good of a position to pass up, but I really don't know much about the city apart from people telling me ""you'll love it!"".  I don't doubt that I'll be happy there, but I have absolutely no clue on where to live.

Information about me:

* 24 year old male

* Software developer

* Passion for motorcycles and old cars

* Enjoys drinking at pubs

* Listens to heavy metal

* Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, lived in Milwaukee for 6 years

I was told there is a decent metal scene, which I hope to get in to.  I would like to live downtown near where I'll be working, so that I can either walk or take the light-rail to my office (located off Hennepin and 5th).  More importantly, since I will know no one in the city, I'd like to live near social venues in order to get to know people.  I'm quite social, but I prefer to not just wander aimlessly around a city I'm not all that familiar with.

I'd rather stay away from anywhere that is super ""collegy"".  While I love to go out and drink at the bars, I prefer to live in a quiet apartment (pet friendly).  Is light-rail easy enough to take to downtown?  Is it pretty reliable as far as scheduling goes?  I'm uncomfortable leaving my motorcycle outside, so anywhere I end up needs to have covered/underground parking available.

Additionally, are there any good metal bars in the downtown area, or other areas?  Are there any motorcycle groups that go out for rides?  Is there a hackerspace?

Thanks in advance for any and all responses!

I'm traveling with one other adult (my mom) and we will be staying in the TC from Thursday (5/23) - Sunday (5/26).  We will be making a go at using only public transportation and our feet, so it will be an adventure!  I primarily need to visit the various campus locations, CURA, etc. but we are hoping to explore the city in general.  There have been a lot of posts about see X, Y, etc. so I will look those over but are there any specific sites that would be awesome to see around Memorial Day weekend?  We are going for more of an urban exploration vibe rather than a museum tour, as I can do that on my own when I relocate.

So, my real questions.  Suggestions on places to stay?  Budget is tight, so we want to avoid swanky but also avoid smoke-stained, bed bug infested type places.  My parents traveled cross country and enjoyed Holiday Inn Express but there must be somewhere more interesting to spend $100/night.

Also, food.  I was thinking about checking out some of the Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives locations but I don't know how cliche that is.  Again, our budget is fairly tight.  As I stated before, I've only been to NYC, Boston, and Baltimore but we are looking for less than $14/plate, if possible, as I don't know what prices are like in the TC.  We aren't looking for surf-n-turf, as we are perfectly happy with a good burger, sandwich, or Chinese.

Thanks for reading!  I am so excited to visit.

Moving out to Minneapolis for my first full-time job in a few weeks. Looking at apartments now. I'll be working in St. Paul, but a few of the people there said that I'd have better luck finding what I'm looking for in living arrangements in Minneapolis. So I thought I'd come to you for specifics.

Looking for a studio apartment and ideally not spending more than $700/month. I've been looking on craigslist and apartments.com with minimal luck so far.

A future co-worker recommended Uptown. Thoughts on this? What other Minneapolis neighborhoods would fit what I'm looking for? Any other information to consider?

The_Holy_Pope	8	3	5	"  I'm in school for audio production at Hennepin Tech in Eden Prairie and need to find a band that would want to record one song. This is a learning experience for me, and some free studio time on great equipment for the band.

  I would prefer that the band be an active band, so I could stop by and see a show and get a feel for the music performed. The only criteria the music has to meet is: containing drums, vocals, and at least one other instrument.

  The time frame for this is a bit wonky as the studio time would be from 3-9 on Mondays starting in either 7 weeks or 12 weeks (this would be the talent's choice.) The recording would take place on those Mondays for 3-4 weeks, so essentially 18-24 hours of studio time for the talent.

1308766649.0	i6edm	End the war in Afghanistan	langostino	10	3	0	"Wednesday, June 22, 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. Lake Street/Marshall Avenue Bridge spanning the Mississippi River between Minneapolis and St. Paul. President Obama will announce his plans for the war in Afghanistan in a speech to the nation on Wednesday evening. Early reports indicate that he will announce a withdrawal of 5,000 to 10,000 troops this year, followed by the additional withdrawal of 30,000 troops starting in 2012. This plan will leave 70,000 U.S. troops and 110,000 private contractors in Afghanistan, in addition to 50,000 NATO troops. The Minnesota Peace Action Coalition (MPAC) endorses the call for a special statement at the Wednesday vigil. The coalition of Twin Cities-area peace and anti-war groups have issued a statement that says in part, ""There can be no withdrawal gesture; the U.S. war in Afghanistan must end and all U.S. troops must be brought home now. Gestures are transient. Unless the President makes a clear commitment to bring the troops home, the U.S. war in Afghanistan will continue with all the tragedy that war brings and billions of dollars wasted. Any token withdrawal will not bring an end to the war. A war-weary U.S. population, the majority of whom want an end to the war in Afghanistan, will not be satisfied with insignificant troop withdrawals,"" said the statement. The recent U.S. Conference of Mayors overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for an end to the war and for funds to be transferred to domestic needs. The financial cost of the war in Afghanistan is $122 billion for 2011 alone, an average of $10.17 billion per month. ""Billions are spent on the war in Afghanistan while millions who have lost their jobs and homes and needed social services are facing massive budget cuts,"" says the statement. Twin Cities-area anti-war activists will be joining with activists across the country starting Wednesday to call for a real end to the war in Afghanistan.

1308543922.0	i41yh	I'm moving to Minneapolis, would like advice on where I should live.	lilith480	7	1	55	"So I will be starting my job at St. Jude Medical in the next few weeks, and the issue is that (at least for the first year) I will be working at both the St. Paul and the Minnetonka site.  

So, my goal is to live somewhere between the two, in a nice/safe/not-too-expensive area, preferably where other young people live and where there are things to do.  

I've heard St. Louis Park might fit this, does that sound right?  Also, is there anywhere in the area that I should avoid because it is a bad area/unsafe?

Also, what other random stuff might I need to know?  For instance, will I need to keep my car in a heated garage in the winter, or just a covered garage?

Oh, and if any of you or people you know are looking to share an apartment in the area where I would want to live, feel free to let me know!

Thanks!

1306437952.0	hkw20	Good public transit, seriously?	leevs11	12	6	23	"I saw this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/ghn3e/ok_so_i_really_want_to_move_to_minneapolisany/
today.  Do you guys really think the transit system is that great?  

The light rail is only useful if you live right on it.  

The buses are unreliable and don't nearly cover enough ground.  Plus they seem to be mostly good for commuting to downtown, not just getting around the city.  

Biking is great, but we are seriously lacking in bike lanes.  I love the trails, but they don't really go where you need them to.  

It's definitely not a walkable city unless you live downtown.  Especially in the winter.  

Add to this that all transit stops from 1:30 to 4 am right as thousands of people are leaving bars forcing them to get behind the wheel of a car.

Where is the good public transit?"	t5_2r3bl	True
1302635588.0	gofra	Greetings from beautiful Portland, Oregon. Let's be friends.	apetickler	8	2	25	"Hi all. I have a lot of family around Minneapolis and I thought maybe I should start trying to make contacts in the area in case I'd like to move there in the future.

I visited pretty much every year when I was growing up but have only been back a handful of times as an adult.

About me: I'm Patrick. I'm 28. I've lived in Oregon all my life. Most of my family that doesn't live in Minneapolis lives in Hawaii. Everyone immediately pegs me as an artist, which I guess I kind of am. I love to draw, paint, etc. I'm a struggling independent graphic designer after quitting a soul-sucking job last year.

I bike everywhere. I love to run. I don't like many video games made after 1996 (I love Tetris, Battletoads, and anything Metroid). I love music and am currently pretty into Japanese stuff from the 70s and 80s, tropicalia and bossa nova, dance music from the last decade, and Ethiopian jazz. I don't read much, but I love Bret Easton Ellis and Douglas Coupland and my favorite novel is *The Crying Of Lot 49*. I love cooking and eating, but I think the current food crit craze is really out of hand. I'm in love with jQuery. I have some hipster tendencies. I'm gay and get along well with most gay crowds.

I think most people are too emotional. Lots of people have tried to amateur-diagnose me with Asberger's over the years. I'm a moderate ent. I have really good hair.

If I sound like one of your friends, [friend me](http://www.facebook.com/apetickler). or, obviously, you can talk to me here. Thanks and have a swell day!"	t5_2r3bl	True

1295853863.0	f7xv7	Legal advice needed with intrusive landlord.  (NE Minneapolis)	warfrogs	6	0	4	"Hey guys, this is my first self-post but I don't really know who else to ask and you all seem somewhat knowledgeable and if not, at least maybe I'll get a laugh out of it.

I know it's late, and I'm on a pretty tight time frame in asking for suggestions within 6 hours, BUT, I really need some help.


Long story short, I moved into a place in Northeast off of Central and the 26th in October and things have been so-so.  Friend of a friend was living there and needed a room-mate since his current room-mate (the son of the landlord) was moving out.  The first few weeks were fine until things started breaking.  First the lock on my door didn't work.  Then the door to the downstairs apartment didn't close OR lock.  The upstairs shower leaks onto the furnace whenever we use it, and there's a lightswitch that if you touch it the wrong way you get a bit of a jolt.  Well, that was all alright, I could deal with it.

Then the landlord's kid started showing up unannounced, usually with the premise that he was getting things he left (which are still here) but occasionally just to do stuff around the house, none of which we ever saw any change from.  He harassed my room-mate who was supposedly behind on rent, would post things on his door, leave dirty footprints through the house, and generally act somewhat unnerving and obnoxious.

It's gotten way worse over the last 3 weeks.  During all the snow emergencies, I got towed 3 times and thus was short on rent.  I told the son that and that I would be paying a month and a half's the next month (which I have) and then another month and a half the month after that (still upcoming).

He said it was fine but that I had to pay.  Well, the day came that rent was due (on the 15th), so I mailed the check to his father (instead of how he wanted me to which was a deposit slip into his checking account).  He showed up that very day to my work, in front of one of my employees and said very loudly in front of customers that I owed him rent and have been avoiding his calls, which I haven't as I haven't received a single one as far as I can remember.  I told him to leave or I'd be calling mall security.

I figured the issue was done since my rent should have shown up by now, until I came home from work and I found my bedroom door (the lock to which I replaced at my own expense) open, which I never do, all of my lights on, and some of my possessions in my closet rifled through along with a note to call the father immediately about further renting.  (Their words, not mine)  I've never met the dad, but our downstairs room-mate has and says he's a reasonable guy and that this sounds more like the son on a power trip, but I'm not really sure.

Now, I work a lot, around 40 hours a week at one job and 10-15 at the other plus side jobs, but as a kid just out of college with student loans, rent, utilities, car payment, and car insurance payment, I don't have a lot of money to consult a lawyer, but I have to believe this is illegal.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what I could possibly do?  I'm calling the cops in at 7 in the morning on 311 before work to report trespassing, but I don't have a real lease, no renters' agreement or anything, but I do have deposit records and the like.  Would I be absolutely screwed if I took him to court about this?

What in the world should I do?

**EDIT:  Called 311 this morning and was floored when they said that it wasn't a criminal matter since it's his property, ended up getting pushed to the Housing Authority, they said it was in fact criminal trespassing and breaking and entering, got pushed BACK to my local precinct and filed a report.  The officer said that it was B&amp;E with trespassing but because I'm on a ""oral month to month contract"" that there's not much I can do without ending up on the street.  He said my best bet was to look for another place and once I found it to take legal action against them.  Lesson learned?  Don't bother with 311, call your local precinct.  Hopefully I can get somewhere quick, because I'm still super floored.  I'll check the thread again tomorrow and keep you guys updated with any developments.  (I'll also be calling the ACTUAL landlord tomorrow instead of his son with whom I've had most dealings so that should be interesting.)**"	t5_2r3bl	True

1376433329.0	1kb5x7	How to lower your internet bill	ECgopher	8	5	5	"Note: cross-posted in r/TwinCities

Thought I'd share this experience, in case anyone else finds it useful.
I live in Minneapolis and get internet service of 40 mbps down / 20 mbps up through Century Link. I had a 6 month promotion from when I signed up for the service. During the 6 month promotion I was paying approximately $40 per month for the internet service and modem lease. I do not use or need a home phone line or television subscription so I only had this internet service.

The 6 month promotion period recently expired. When it did, my bill jumped to about $80 per month for the same service.

I looked up the prices/promotions for new customers at Century Link and Comcast. New Century Link customers can still receive what looks like the same promotion I had when I started with Century Link. New Comcast customers can get 50 mbps service and a basic TV subscription for $50 per month (for 6 months).

I called Century Link customer service. From the list of automated options, I chose billing and then asked to talk to a customer service representative. I told the representative my bill recently doubled and I want to see what can be done about it or if I should look into other services. I told the representative I could get faster speeds for less money at Comcast -- the 50 mbps for $50. The representative said she could offer me lower speeds at lower prices, but that's all she could do, she would have to transfer me to another department if that wasn't satisfactory. I asked to be transferred to the other department.

When another representative picked up, I told him the same thing I told the first representative. He was able to offer me a rebate off my bill for the next 12 months. With the rebate, my bill will be about $48 per month for the same 40 mbps service. I went along with that.

Don't know if this will work for anyone else. But figured I'd offer up my experience in case it can help you avoid overpaying for internet."	t5_2r3bl	True

I will be starting work in Roseville, MN in a couple of weeks. I quickly need to find an apartment. I was assuming that Minneapolis would be the best bet. I've been looking online but find it difficult to really get a sense of anything. I plan on going there in a few days and was wondering if anyone had any advice. Are there Realtors that deal with apartment rentals? What are the nice places and what should I avoid? I'm looking to spend around $800 for an apartment. Thanks for any tips!"	t5_2r3bl	True

I am interested in taking the Amtrak train from Minneapolis to Whitefish, MT to do some skiing this winter, and am wondering if anyone has had experience riding this line. It is the Empire line of Amtrak.

I have only rode trains in Europe, so I have no idea what to expect from US trains.

Some questions I have:
-What is the riding experience like? I plan to ride coach, does upper or lower level matter?
-Did you experience any delays? Its a long 22 hour ride, so I am worried about potential delays.
-What are the seat arrangements like? Was sleeping an issue? 
-Can you bring on your own booze?
-Do you have any advice about riding Amtrak - what to do or to avoid doing? 
-How did you like it? Would you do it again?

Thanks for any responses!

Edit: Thanks for all the replies - I've also received a tip that the train is often delayed for 4 hours or more, sometimes up to 24 hours, especially in winter. Makes me hesitant to go Amtrak..."	t5_2r3bl	True

1347391037.0	zq20l	What do we do about our recycling program?	readyifyouare	11	5	6	"Last weekend, I worked my first game as a suite server for ARAMARK catering during a Minnesota Gopher game at TCF Bank Stadium. As with almost any catered event, there is A LOT of waste. Many companies force you to throw away excess food, and while ARAMARK (at least in their UMN/Arboretum locations) composts all of their food waste, this game did not. 

We were told in our closing staff meeting that this would be the last time that happened, and that we'd be composting all food waste from now on, and that there was just a mix up for last weekend's game. Even more jarring, I learned that while we DO recycle, the company that handles our recycling isn't able to keep up with the sheer amount of recycling that comes out of the stadium, so they were only going to be collecting our glass recycling. That is only ONE THIRD of the recycling that can be processed from each game. 

Is there something that can be done about this? I'm not really sure how to go about getting this fixed. It is absolutely disgusting to me that with all of the pressure to recycle, its actually the recycling facility that is preventing it. Is there more than one recycling facility that could be contacted? Or is it more of a funding issue that needs to be brought to a city council meeting?"	t5_2r3bl	True

I have found literally 2 places that would allow my dog out of contacting 50+ places/people/companies to rent from. Unfortunately, those two places I did find went to other people, who as it turned out don't have a dog. I have an 8 year old rescued husky/malamute mix (had him for 6+ years), great dog (minus the shedding) and runs between 60 - 65 pounds. Not that big of a dog! But every place I see either doesn't allow dogs at all, or restricts them to about 35 pounds or less. I have no idea how people with so called ""aggressive"" breeds pull it off. Getting rid of my dog is not an option (I'd rather walk into traffic than abandon my dog), and we need to find a place by November. Anyone else run into this problem or have any advice?

1319389918.0	lm5c7	Out door Shooting ranges?	AurianaV	9	3	7	"Hey everyone. Ok so hubby and I moved from las vegas 2 years ago to the Minneapolis area. 

While we were still back in Vegas though we bought a gun and would go shooting. We tried the indoor ranges, but they're so much money. The cool thing about vegas was just a small drive and a little ways out from the city, and its all just desert. 

Well, there is this known out door shooting area to the locals. But it's nothing you would find in a phone book. 
Part of growing up there comes with perks. One is you just kinda know its there, it becomes common knowledge. 
It was about 30 to 40 minutes out of the city, in a 100% desert area with hills and rocks ect. 

So many people have gone out there and taken advantage of it, it has become a soda can, glass bottle, car part, computer monitor, grave yard. Everything half destroyed or broken from being used as target practice, and the grounds were covered in gun and rainbow colored rifle shells.

One of the coolest places we found to go shooting.

So my question is directed to some of the long term residents to the area. Is there anywhere in Minnesota that has a similar place to go shooting? Ideally not more than an hour or two away?

If anyone knows of any info, I’d be so stoked to find a similar place to go have some fun and shoot again.
Thanks all!
