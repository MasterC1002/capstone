I saw this movie last night and was blown away by its amazing fight choreography and great use of tension.  It has a simplicity to it that means it's easy to watch and understand which means it's a great film for watching with a friend.  That said, this film completely immersed me in its gritty setting and some scenes actually made my heart pound!  I warn you though that this film gets incredibly brutal and fairly gory, it's not for the faint hearted.

The movie is drop dead weird, and the cinematography is really damn odd. It's interesting to some, but for me it was kind of a turn off at first. There's a lot of things you will not understand at first, and it really gives off a ""video game"" vibe. The whole movie seems like it could be from a video game and theres scenes that represent some games. The general feel of the movie is one large climax. There's no ups and downs, the movie just keeps getting better. Give it a little, and you'll really like it, if you like action movies about revenge and honor. Great movie! 8.5/10 for me.

I was looking for some thrills while waiting for the release of The Conjuring here in Europe and this old classic movie totally made it. It's still very efficient and did not age at all. The tension is built throughout the movie and reach a level that made  me pause it several times during the final act to cool down. The acting is brilliant too. 

Hitchcock loved the story and wanted to direct it but couldn't because of legal issues and the result was so good he directly asked the author to write him Vertigo.

Holds a 97% on rotten tomatoes (don't check the page it's a bit spoiler-ish), [and a 8,2 on imdb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046911/). None of the english-sub trailers did it justice. And don't even dare to check the 90's remake with Sharone Stone.

Its director, Henri-Georges Clouzot is a master of suspense ([The Wages of Fear holds a 8,3 on imdb, it needs to be checked as well](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046268/)).

I really want to find more movies like this.

What do I mean by atmospheric? I mean one of the dir's primary goals was to establish a ""mood"" or ""feeling"" even to a fault (eg, ""Tree of Life"" focuses on atmosphere perhaps to the extent that it detracts from being coherent).

What do I mean by visually beautiful? Lots of movies are good-looking, but I like movies where the *primary* goal was to look visually amazing - where every shot is perfectly designed (eg, ""Tron Legacy"" is a fantasy example of this, ""The Master"" is a real world example of this).

What do I mean by ""features OST prominently"" or ""soundtrack at forefront""? Well, I guess, first I prefer atmospheric soundtracks. Eg, ""Magnolia"" might be well-integrated brilliantly with its OST (think of when the characters all start singing the Aimee Mann song as if in a music video). And eg, ""Almost Famous"" (Tiny Dancer scene). But I'm looking more for OSTs that are ""atmospheric"" if that makes any sense - ""atmospheric"" meaning the OST propels the mood of the scene without stumbling into the limelight. Think of ""Tron Legacy,"" ""Lost in Translation,"" ""Traffic,"" ""The Fountain,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Drive,"" etc.

I know this is all kind of vague, but I think of other people have the same preferences they'll know *exactly* what I'm talking about and hopefully be able to recommend similar movies. Thanks a lot!!"	t5_2sqpa	True

I've seen a few movies as such, and I have to add that shots of space are a real bonus. I've figured that I really do enjoy psychological films, but I'm not sure if that's the real genre that I'm looking for...it might very well be.
The only good examples I can remember at the time would be:

* The Fountain
* A Space Odyssey
* Inception
* Memento
* K-PAX
* Primer

Also, there's a movie I saw a few years ago that I can't remember the name too...sorry to ask, but maybe someone can help me remember the name. It was animated and had to do with a journey. Several members for a crew were gathered up and took off to a journey, that dealt with gods and sirens. There was one scene that had a guy in a dessert being played by a goddess and the background was stars with the constellations showing...I can't get much more descriptive than that.

Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg have great comedic chemistry. The Andy's comedic style was highlighted with Rashida's inherently cute awkwardness. Oh... the awkwardness... I will never look at chapstick the same way again...

The soundtrack captures the mood nicely and introduced me to a plethora of new and interesting songs. I found myself Shazaaming every song that came on. It had an indie, alternative score that had my head bobbing in approval. I have yet to download the soundtrack, but it is definitely on my to do list. 

The story itself hit a little close to home for my compatriot and I. It made us reflect on a multitude of our past relationships. For those trying or have tried to stay friends with their ex, prepare for a bombardment of reminiscent pain.

It was clever, painful, and somewhat aggravating at times, but overall good movie and definite red box: 9/10 in my book.

If you like the first movie then definitely  check out Men in Black 3. Hanging out, bustin' aliens again was seriously a fun ride. Give it a chance.

1341972529.0	wd2d5	"Let's Do A Movie Night! Noir Crime, now and then. 
(The Maltese Falcon, Chinatown, and L.A. Confidential)"	Calamity58	21	4	5	"READ FIRST. THE SETUP!

So I had this idea to do a suggestion series of sorts.

I would suggest a double or triple feature for you guys to spend a night on. I suppose if you had seen one or two of them, I would suggest alternates.

NOW TO THE MOVIES!

We start the night with The Maltese Falcon.

A true classic. Almost film perfection, this Bogie machine features a truly intense plot with superb acting that rivals any film period in history.
I can't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it, but a definite for any film addict.

Next up is Chinatown.

This Roman Polanski epic has a truly captivating plot carried by Jack Nicholson and his fantastic acting. Definitely not for the feint of heart: it has a fearsome run-time of over two hours that is not always exhilarating, edge-o-the-seat action. But fear not. This great piece of work stands as a testament to the power of thought and honest acting.

Lastly, to finish the night with a bang, L.A. Confidential. 

This star-studded film is an excellent study of multiple, well-developed characters. As a relatively new-guy (hehehe) at the time, Guy Pearce is a stand-out with his spectacular performance as a young, budding cop with ideals that seem set-in-stone.
All in all, the multi-layered feel of this film will keep you engaged till it's excellent end.

IMDBs

The Maltese Falcon - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033870/

Chinatown - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/

L.A. Confidential - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119488/


Alternates

If you've seen The Maltese Falcon, stick with another classic noir film to get the same feel.

The Killing - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049406/

Double Indemnity - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036775/

The Postman Always Rigs Twice - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038854/

If you've seen Chinatown, try another middle-years noir film. Maybe even early neo-noir, to get the feel of the transitive years.

Farewell, My Lovely - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072973/

Murder on the Orient Express - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071877/

Sisters - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070698/

If you've seen L.A. Confidential, replace it with a recent noir film or a neo-noir film from the 1980's or later.

Blade Runner - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/

The Departed - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568346/

NOTES:

**THESE ARE ALL ADULT MOVIES! THIS IS NOT A MOVIE NIGHT FOR KIDS!**
I am not responsible for your child seeing blood, murder, rape, or hearing excellent use of curse words.


Thank you for reading this! I hope you have as much fun watching these as I had compiling the list.

If you guys like this, please let me know, and I will do it again.
Also, please make requests of genres or themes you would like me to make a night of.

I had a quick question. usually when I watch shows the character that you're designed to hate is just too obvious. Of course I'm gonna hate that blonde haired bitch-prince and his mother in the first season of game of thrones, I course I'm going to hate sylar in heroes (although our of these examples this one is the closest to what I'm looking for, because I began to sympathize with him) as well as skylar in BrBa and ricks silly wife and Darryl's brother in the walking dead. 
What I'm looking for is more of a controversial characterization. the reason I said shows is because I doubt many movies will have the time frame in order to do this, but I'm still open to suggestions.  I'm looking for something where different people watching side with different characters depending on what happened. I'm tired of the black or white. I'm 3 episodes into game of thrones and it's already so obvious who the audience is supposed to hate. it bores me! Also, feel free to suggest books as well.

So. Films not just where there might be one affectationally rainy scene, but films where rain is a vital part of creating the atmosphere. I'm thinking films like Blade Runner in which the prejudicial smothering rain has a symbolic meaning. If you want, you could mention films where other kinds of weather are used to the same effect. Honestly I thought it might just be an interesting thing to discuss really.

I know there are many older threads asking the same question. I have been challenged by my friends to pick a movie and I am not going to kid around. I genuinely want to experience as much fear and stress as is possible from a movie. I'm a bit confused if I want a movie that is utterly depraved (horrifying) or one that has sudden scares and brief moments of tension.

It needs to be a fairly recent (past 20 years) modern horror. 
I want something that would scare you now, not something that scared you as a child.
It needs to be deeply unsettling, and not solely consisting of sudden loud noises.
It cannot be the kind of movie that is mostly defined by the way it ended.


So far a few movies that have failed me are The Shining, a slow paced psychological horror just didn't do it. Alien was okay but not really that scary. Event Horizon started promisingly and then turned into a slasher. The Thing (2011) I got laughed at for this one.

I have shortlisted The Descent and The Blair Witch Project. Other movies that seem okay, but not as good are Hostel, The Thing (1982), The Hills Have Eyes, Audition, The Ring, Paranormal Activity,[REC]. I've sort of answered my own question, but I would like your opinion.

It's not a typical stoner film, but all the nonsense talk about random stuff felt oddly familiar. Maybe you give it a shot, at least for Jason Statham with hair.

1354893388.0	14g2y2	[Request] Hyper-Violent flicks like The Raid and 13 Assassins	perverse_imp	16	4	26	"Hello again r/MovieSuggestions! You guys helped me out in a big way about a month ago with my [rather specific request](http://www.reddit.com/r/MovieSuggestions/comments/124iqq/request_foreign_actioncrime_noir_flicks/) for foreign action/vigilante movies. I spent a great deal of time browsing Amazon's DVD/Bu-Ray market place because of that thread. Lots of adrenaline gone to waste in an arm chair and about $150 later: I now have a respectable action movie collection from overseas. My wallet hates you guys but my CD rack is looking quite full, so thank you all for your great suggestions. I'm back for more so lets get to it:




[Hyper-Violence!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=uI-V0rrlZBo#t=32s) This is the stuff I'm looking for! Brutality, wrath, desperate fury, etc. I'm aware that The Raid is currently the end-all-be-all for gritty violence. I'll take whatever you guys can throw me at me that's similar. Doesn't matter what language it's in, or the year it came out. I watched damn near everything in that last thread and a few stuck out:



- [Merantau](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1368116/)   - the movie overall was quite mediocre. The combat, which I love and will take with even the shittiest overall plot, was great. Thanks /u/tribalspoon for that one.



- [13 Assassins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1436045/)  - I almost didn't watch this movie because it started so slowly, but I stuck it out and was rewarded with a glorious blood bath of the kind I've not seen since the opening of Saving Private Ryan. Thank you to /u/tribalspoon for this suggestion, and the many others you provided. I did try to watch most of them.



- [Oldboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)  - Thanks to /u/Bane18 for suggesting this one. I wasn't sure what to make of this movie at the start and I almost felt like I was going to be disappointed. Random fellow picked off the street and held hostage = action movie? Meh...I didn't see how it could work out. But then everything took a twist into WTF land and heads started breaking. Wonderful movie.


- [Cleanskin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598873/)  - I'm a big fan of Sean Bean and the British in general, so when you toss a spy and an off the grid stop-the-terrorists-before-shit-gets-blown-up plot at me, well, you get smiles. A thanks to /u/sven_hoek for that suggestion.



Excepting the movies Mother, The Chaser, Stray Dog, The Guard, and Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, I watched every movie in that last thread. So whatever suggestions you guys have for me this time, please note my wallet hates you all, but I've been having a blast on the weekends marathoning these and I appreciate the time several of you have put into keeping this sub active-despite the presence of useless lurkers like me.

1354287553.0	141xno	[Request] Smart humour movies	tardis_traveler	17	3	33	"Hi there, 

I am looking for movies that are based around smart kind of humour such as The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy (i am a HUGE fan of the books and the kind of humour used). I also enjoyed the few scenes i saw from adaptations of the Discworld universe by Terry Pratchett, but i have no idea how they are called.

So what other smart humour movies are out there? (i don't like the current Comedy trend mostly based on human stupidity, excessive use of nudity or sex to cover for lack of story or the typical Adam Sandler movie)

Many thanks for any suggestions.

It doesn't necessarily have to be animated, ***--(EDIT5b): BUT ANIMATED MOVIES ARE PREFERRED--*** or fit precisely into the description I gave in my title, just as long as it has the same feel, atmosphere, spirit, etc., as the movies I mentioned above.

I already have [Heavy Metal 2000](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119273/?ref_=sr_3) on the list but I am doubtful if it will live up to the reputation the original left me with.

Any suggestions?

Edit 1: I will be checking out the ""People who liked this also liked..."" section on IMDb and add them to this post.

* ~~[Gandahar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095525/?ref_=tt_rec_tt)~~ (1988) Wattched it, very cool! I liked the way it incorporated time travel.
* [Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1984)
* [Krull](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085811/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1983)
* ~~[Time Masters]~~(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084315/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1982) I loved this movie the best out of the three I have watched so far. I don't know why, it just hit me right in the feels.
* ~~[Fantastic Planet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070544/?ref_=tt_rec_tt)~~ (1973) Very unique scenario and concepts, I loved the vegetation on the alien planet, very interestin, a great watch.
* [Starchaser: The Legend of Orin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090065/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1985)
* [Space Adventure Cobra](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163494/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1982)
* [Wings of Honneamise](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093207/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1987)
* [Pereval](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259499/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) (1988)

Edit 4: Watched Gandahar and Fantastic planet, they did not disappoint. I'd recommend them if you're into that kind of animation.

~~Edit 3: Krull is no longer on netflix (just my luck) so I'm watching Gandahar. I guess I might be back to report what I think of it.~~

~~Edit 2: If you have any must watch recommendations from the list above it would be greatly appreciated. Or if you know of any of the above movies are on Netflix (Canada) that would also help (I'm pretty sure Krull is, I might watch that tonight).~~"	t5_2sqpa	True

1354062781.0	13wku5	[REQUEST/GAME?] Program the whole year in Movies - January Edition. 	ke7in11	12	0	3	"Let's play a game.

I started playing this game with my wife the other day where we were trying to fill a year with a movie schedule.  Movies would be scheduled appropriate to the time of year, holidays, seasons, general mood, etc.

For instance, Before Halloween we would set up a list of horror movies.  Or, in my opinion, if I wanted to submit all of the Harry Potter movies, I'd likely do one a week beginning on Halloween, and trying to end around Christmas. I'd personally probably restrict sports movies to the time of the year where their seasons are active, but there's no rule on this.  If you want to watch Rudy in April, well, save it for the April thread.

This thread is intended to just be the start, for January.

My personal logic steers me into picking movies with themes of self-betterment, or transformation because of all of the New Year's resolutions, or maybe a little towards the dark-then-uplifting because January is dead in the center of winter with cold weather and long nights. Or, just in general, life-cycle type movies because we're beginning a new year.

After a drunken house party with his straight mates, Russell heads out to a gay club. Just before closing time he picks up Glen but what's expected to be just a one-night stand becomes something else, something special.

Here's the trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUU_WzRBHX4

The movie is very nice, it deals with emotions between a newly gay couple which emerged from a one-night-stand, but has no real future. The getting-to-know-each-other phase and the falling-in-love phase are very nicely shown and it's a really nice movie, also for straight people. ;)

* 28 Days Later - I love the film for the cinematics mainly (i.e. the camera used, the types of shots, the soundtrack, etc.); you really become immersed in the atmosphere/feel of the film.

* Snatch

* Basically all of the other Christopher Nolan films. I haven't seen *The Following* or *Insomnia*.

* Leon

* Se7en

* **Edit**: Interview With The Vampire - I guess I have to say I like a lot of Brad Pitt films.

* Some other random ones for the sake of it: *Inglourious Basterds*, *Taken*.

Films I haven't seen, yet am aware I might like them:

* Reservoir Dogs

* American Beauty

* Taxi Driver

* A Clockwork Orange

I would probably say **there are a few odd ones out** on that list (e.g *28 Days Later*, *Snatch* possibly).

I would also **suggest** that you can **classify the films into two groups**:

* Films that really make you think, that purposely do/can apply to your life, and generally **makes you question things** (e.g. *Fight Club*).

* Films that **keep you enticed with an unpredictable plot/unconventional format** that really catch you out in an original way (e.g. *Memento*).

Obviously those **described criteria overlap and can probably be easily disputed** with much more thought, but that's how I'd classify them with the thoughts that came to mind when making this post.

**Thank you**, and if you are keen on any of the films listed and haven't seen some others, then do so!

**Edit**: Just to say, my favourites which I'd pick are *Fight Club*, *Trainspotting*, and *Memento*."	t5_2sqpa	True

I love a good action film, if it's a satire, I'm OK with that. I like movies with a good storyline and above average acting, but if the story is good enough I'll power through it. I'm a huge fan of Sci Fi, but I prefer something with a solid plot.

I love Quinton Tarantino's work, and I've watched Django Unchained (loved it), Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (Surprisingly good), and Inglorious Bastard. There may be a couple more I've seen but can't remember at the moment. 

Also, if it helps, I'm a 21 year old male living in the US. Netflix movies are great, but if it's on DVD, I can deal with that :D

Oh, Twister and Dumb And Dumber are probably my 2 favorite movies of all time :)

Thanks for reading my mini novel and I look forward to your suggestions. I'm open to movies that don't fit with what I've written, by the way.

TL;DR: Sick, desire movies (Netflix or DVD/Torrent), willing to try new things.

It's a good thing I have quality internet, sheesh! SO MANY TORRENTS!

First of all, I'm looking for a horror movie that will actually scare me. The only two that have managed to succeed are Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (I was 8) and The Strangers. Youtube series like MarbleHornets and TribeTwelve will scare me from time to time, and I LOVE watching them. So what I'm looking for is as follows:

1. Something that has a relatively sensical plot. I'm not saying that it can't have any supernatural elements, but I want the supernatural to make sense in the context of the world created. Randomly having a ghost/demon/zombie apocalypse doesn't work for me; my willing suspension of disbelief only goes so far.

2. If the plot does have supernatural elements, I generally prefer ghosts/demons to various other creatures. The exception being black and white horror films...because Bela Lugosi/Boris Karloff are amazing. 

3. Nothing that could potentially qualify as gore/torture porn. I really have no desire to see the Saw movies or Hostel, for example. A little bit of gore is fine, but I'm more interested in stuff that's psychologically chilling. I ALSO ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO SEE RAPE REVENGE FILMS. 

Here's a list of horror films that I've enjoyed: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, the Strangers, The Ring/Ringu, The Exorcist, The Pact, The Shining, Cabin in the Woods, A Tale of Two Sisters, Shutter Island (if that counts) and Dracula.

I'm planning on watching Sinister next.

If you could help me out, that'd be very much appreciated."	t5_2sqpa	True

1339068031.0	upm5v	An iPhone app that suggests a movie critic you should follow	b3no	13	4	9	"Hey reddit, I shared this /r/movies a few weeks ago, but figured there'd be some interest here as well.

I've been working on a side project for iPhone since late last year. The idea is that although there are services like MetaCritic and RottenTomatoes that give an aggregate score for movies, it would be cool to figure out which professional movie critic is the closest match to your personal preferences. A user could rate a number of movies (either by browsing a list or searching), and have their votes compared to all the critics out there to see who best matches up.
I use the RottenTomatoes API for data. I've had it out since February, but have recently made a bunch of improvements and think it's a bit more stable/useful now.  It's called ""Critic Match"".

It might surprise you that many of the funnest, most innovative action films of the last decade never made it to theaters.  You owe it to yourself to check out:

[NINJA](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182921/) - Remember BATMAN BEGINS? Remember how that awesome clan of Ninjas trained that one guy who totally betrayed them and killed the master and then went into business as a lone ninja psycho with a bunch of high-tech gadgets? Wasn't it great how the surviving ninjas spent the rest o the movie getting righteous revenge against him for - Wait, that psycho was the good guy? What the hell? Somebody should make a movie where the ninjas are the good guys. And it should star Scott Adkins. And for some reason there should be an evil corporate cult with a tenuous connection to the ninjas just so Scott Adkins has more people to kick into submission. That would be a good movie. 

[UNDISPUTED III: REDEMPTION](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156466/) - If this came out before 1992, we would be looking back on it as one of the definitive macho man classics. What on the surface appears to be just another prisoners-as-gladiators rerun is elevated to legendary status thanks to Scott Adkins' obscenely entertaining performance as ubermench Russian antihero Yuri Boyka. After chewing up the scenery as the villain in Undisputed 2, Boyka finally gets his moment in the sun as he takes on colorful martial arts masters from around the globe in his quest to become ""ZEE MOST COMPLETE FIGHTER IN ZEE VURLD!!"" See it. Don't worry if you missed Undisputed 1 and 2 - everything is explained here in the first 30 seconds.  

[BORN TO FIGHT](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428725/) - From the lunatic masochists who brought you ONG BAK comes the most ridiculously awesome movie ever made. When Burmese terrorists armed with a nuclear missile invade a small border village in Thailand, it is up to the Thai Olympic team to stop them. Real-life athletes combine Gymnastics-fu, Soccer-fu, Rugby-fu, Hackey Sack-fu, and good old-fashioned Muy Thai to bring down the terrorists in a fist-pumping, jingoistic explosion that lasts 45 minutes and looks like it cost the lives of hundreds of stunt men. 

[BLOOD AND BONE](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0346631/) - Starring THE DARK KNIGHT's Michael Jai White as an enigmatic Badass motherfucker who teams up with Rufio from HOOK to bring down a mob boss by competing in underground street fights. With a surprisingly well-developed villain, incredible martial arts courtesy of White, and the long-awaited return of Rufio, this is 90 straight to video minutes you'll be glad you watched. 

[THE TOURNAMENT](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471041/) - All the world's greatest assassins compete in a last-man-standing fight to the death. And it's awesome. Starring Ving Rhames as Ving Rhames, Kelly Hu as attractive woman, that free-running guy from CASINO ROYALE, Scott Adkins, and Ian Summerholder as a cowboy who collects trigger fingers. Ooh! And Robert Carlyle as a priest. 

[UNIVERSAL SOLDER: REGENERATION](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288403/) - Definitely not what you'd expect from this franchise. After five goofy popcorn films, REGENERATION takes a new perspective on the concept of undead soldiers and ambitiously attempts something genuinely dramatic. Told less like a traditional action movie and more like a surreal PTSD nightmare, the direction is slow-paced and muted, with brutal, unglamorized violence. The story, as it is, is pared down to such a simple level as to feel like background to the strange, inexorably tragic atmosphere. Sure, the budget, acting, and dialogue are all standard STV quality, but the action delivers and the message hits home. And if you've seen every action movie ever made, it's nice to occasionally stumble across something that breaks the mold. Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and Andrei the Pitbull star.

If you really want contemporary action films that are full of boobs, bodies and blood--and might actually be worth your time--these are a good place to start."	t5_2sqpa	True

1370253481.0	1fkmnk	[REQUEST] Films with limited locations/actors.	Jeffool	14	3	39	"I tend to think highly of films that have one/few settings and a cast that's closed off from the world by some device. They seem to force an interaction and personal drama that I enjoy, even when partnered with a general/vague outside force (like zombie films do).


Some examples of what I mean:

Films:

* 12 Angry Men
* Lifeboat
* The Man from Earth
* Buried


Then there are looser examples where you've got relatively small casts, or relatively limited settings, but they still work on some degree:

* Clue
* Reservoir Dogs
* Night of the Living Dead
* Dawn of the Dead


TV:
One could argue most TV shows fit this. The West Wing was mostly a small cast in the White House. Lost at its best was people on an island, The Office is mostly in an office, Eureka usually has one new person each episode, etc. But I'm looking for something a little more hardcore.


* Community's ""bottle"" episodes are an easily recognizable example.
* Titus was the only other one I could think of. Sometimes they had other people, and it took me a few episodes to recognize it, but essentially each episode is a play that takes place on one set.

And there's probably good examples I've seen that aren't coming to me offhand. But, I'd appreciate any help you can give."	t5_2sqpa	True

I would appreciate some details about the movie as well, such as the general idea of the plot (no spoilers of any kind), but that's definitely not required...
