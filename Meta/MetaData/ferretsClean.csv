1368361809.0	1e6hz0	In 6 months of ferret ownership, this is what I have learnt.	Variola13	75	7	48	"After reading the ferrets vs babies earlier, I was inspired to collate my observations and post them. 

**Ferrets are cute.** Sure most animals are cute, especially baby ones. But ferrets are born cute and retain that cuteness for the rest of their life. Everyone else's ferret is also cute, no matter how in love you are with your own fuzzy, there is still enough cuteness room left to consider every one else‚Äôs ferret seriously cute as well. 


**Anything is considered possible to stash**, and I mean *anything*. Doesn't matter If it is dangerous, three times the size of the ferret, or will go off and make a smell in 24 hours it is still possible to drag it under the sofa. If a nuclear reactor was free floating, a ferret would try and stash it. 

You may be inclined to think ferrets are miniature preppers, and are hoarding resources in the event of catastrophe. Nope, the items stashed by a ferret are in no way representative of the usefulness of them, to the ferret or to anyone else.I have dabbled with the theory that ferrets can predict the future, and my jill knows that a large pile of plastic pots, tubs and lids will be essential for survival in years to come. I am not convinced though. 

**If a ferret knows it is not allowed to go somewhere, or do something, they will make it their life goal to do it.** Hours of time will be dedicated to figuring out how to achieve this goal. OCD is a way of life for ferrets, and it is the *only* way of life.  If they do achieve it, it is usually marked with a celebratory poop there. 

 My jill has learnt the sound of the doorbell, and the sound of me taking my keys off the rack to go out, and makes a dash for the front door every time because she knows she isn't allowed to go out there.

 
On the topic of poops, ferrets will poop in a litter tray, if they feel like it. Maybe. Just because they have done it 100% of the time before, does not mean they will do it the next time, or the time after. There is of course no rhyme or reason for this that humans can understand. Also they poop in weird places, places you wouldn‚Äôt even think they can get into, that strange smell you cannot trace? It is a fossilised ferret poop. 


**Ferret play**. The weasel war dance is possibly the funniest thing on the planet, and what‚Äôs more not matter how much your fuzzy does this, the novelty never wears off. It is still hilarious. 

Any time is play time, middle of the night, meal times, when you are getting dressed in the morning, the ends of trousers legs are a flag of play to a ferret and must be grabbed. 

Digging is also ferret play, I thought ferrets dug tunnels but apparently not. Soil snorkelling seems to be the in thing for fuzzies. Unless of course it is a flat surface within something, like a bag or a sofa. In that case furious on the spot digging needs to commence, until they reach the centre of the earth. 

**Everything requires sniffing**, not once or twice or ten times, but a gazillion times. Even if it is has been previously sniffed before, within the last 60 seconds it will need sniffing again. 

**There is no level of height a ferret thinks it cannot jump from**. Book cases, cages, human arms are all of jumping height to a ferret. The jump down itself is more of a slide off and hope to land, rather than anything pre-planned. You may think that a ferret has no fear or is extremely brave because of this. However, if anything truly scary comes along, like an unknown site, smell, or a new watering can in the garden, all that is needed to deal with it is a bog brush tail. All wars could be solved if only soldiers had a tail they could fluff up to twice its size. 

Climbing is a different matter though; I am of the opinion that mountaineers can learn a lot from ferrets. Unless a surface is dead smooth, and completely vertical, it is game on to a ferret. Despite only having shortish legs, they do not appear to get tired when attempting to climb up a curtain. 

-note on legs, if you observe your ferret running across the floor, their legs look like a blur. I have come to the conclusion that ferrets are either clockwork, with an invisible key in the back, or they can hover 1 inch above the ground and that is how they move. 


And lastly,**sleeping**. Ferrets do not have spines, in contrary to every x-ray taken and animal care book written, ferrets are invertebrates. There is no other possible explanation for the twisted contortions they manage to get into while sleeping, and still find it comfortable. Yoga teachers have nothing on ferrets. 


(Background)

[Roe]( http://i.imgur.com/XnxquZTh.jpg), my ferret came into my life 6 months ago, we found her as a skinny flea-ridden and poorly stray. We fell in love with her sweet nature and watched her go from a nervous shy fuzzy, to a loving sociable, naughty little ferret. She is nuts, and I love being owned by a fuzzy. :-)

Please upvote this for visibility. I don't care about the karma, but I want to get this animal back to its home.

I was working a shift at the Brodie Ln PetCo in Austin, TX when a man brought this ferret into the store. He had found it wandering in his front yard.

The ferret is very social and friendly, and is in good health. It isn't even hungry, so I suspect it escaped from its home very recently.

Another PetCo customer wanted to adopt the ferret right there, but I insisted on trying to find the original owners.

The ferret is living in my bathroom now, but I cannot keep it longer than overnight. Tomorrow it will go the Austin Animal Center, where it will be in rabies quarantine for three days. After those three days, it is eligible for adoption, and the PetCo customer will adopt it at that point.

If this is your animal, please contact me ASAP. To verify ownership, you must tell me the gender of the animal, and the area that it was lost from. I know where it was found, and I doubt it went far from home.
