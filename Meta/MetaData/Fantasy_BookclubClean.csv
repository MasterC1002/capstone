1338480115.0	ue0ti	Ask your questions here for C.S. Friedman!	gunslingers	37	8	82	"We are honored to have C.S. Friedman joining the book club for a special Q&amp;A.

C.S. Friedman is a well known author that writes epic science fiction and fantasy novels which feature complex interweavings of plot and richly detailed settings. To date she has published eight novels, several short stories, and a sourcebook for White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade role-playing game. Originally a costume designer by trade, Friedman began her publishing career in 1986, and quit costuming in 1996 to write full-time. She was nominated for the John Campbell award in 1986, and her novel This Alien Shore was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.

Though her books often center on traditional fantasy themes like magic, vampires, and telepathy, Friedman prides herself on providing the kind of detail and consistency that makes the imaginary seem real. She rejects traditional Fantasy's clearly delineated dichotomy between good and evil, preferring to explore the uncertain and often uncomfortable grey zone between the two. Her work is often dark, and some of her most compelling characters are also her most disturbing.

Friedman's newest works include the novel Legacy of Kings  and Dominion, a new novella in the Coldfire universe.

Lets give C.S. a very warm welcome. Post your questions here and she will be here this evening at 7pm central to answer them."	t5_2s92h	True

1338181923.0	u8awy	Hey Reddit, will you check out my wife's book and give some feedback please?  Thanks!	tongatime	33	12	17	"So my wife has self-published a really good book for Kindle on Amazon.com (also available on the UK/Euro amazon websites, but only in English language so far).  It's a middle-grade to YA fantasy book about a small town southern girl who gets lured into the clutches of an evil witch and has to use her courage and wits to save herself and her loved ones.

I try to support indie writers and buy a lot of self-published stuff.  I know I'm totally biased, but I think her book totally kicks ass over most of the stuff I read from other self-published authors.   My wife spent several years writing, revising editing, etc. and it really does show.  It's a good book.

The problem is just trying to get folks to read it.  Those who have read it and given feedback have all been quite positive, but it's just hard in the vast sea of self-published stuff on Amazon to get much attention.

My wife is pretty shy about self-promotion, so I'm doing most of the work right now trying to let folks know about her book.

I've tried blog posts, advertising (including paid advertising here on reddit), kindle freebie giveaways, contests, etc., but so far not much traction.

I've sent copies to several reviewers and am still waiting on most of them to  read it (they all say they have tons of books to read so long wait times).  One reviewer actually gave it to her teenage daughter to read it and she said she ""loved it"", but didn't leave a review on Amazon.

Anyway, I'm pretty old school so all this internet promoting, social network stuff, etc. is all new to me with a sort of steep and confusing learning curve, and I'm quickly learning that I'm a bit out of my depth. 

Will you kind folks please take a look at it on Amazon and give some feedback.  Is the cover art okay?  Is the book description lacking something? etc.

Should she do an AMA on reddit?  Other suggestions? (I think she and I are both socially awkward penguins, so any help is much appreciated!)

I've got the price set low right now, so if anyone wants a free copy, shoot me a private message with your email and I'll send you a gift copy from Amazon.com (I don't think you can receive amazon gift copies unless you have a U.S. amazon account.  Sorry UK/Euro folks.  You guys should complain to Amazon about this I think.)

Anyway, here's the link to her book 

http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0075SRW2E

Thanks for any help folks!

**tl;dr**  Wife has an awesome book at link above.  Please take a look and let me know how to get folks to read it.

I've been getting back into reading, what a nice hobby, especially late at night to wind down and not go from flashing screens right to sleep...

I have very much liked the previous series and would like to find other books which could be compared in

a) quality and

b) serious settings etc.

c) characters that can actually die

d) shades of gray in place of black and white


I very much enjoyed the following series:

First Law, best served cold, the heroes - J. Abercrombie

A dance of fire and ice - G. R.R. M. Martin

The black company novels - G. Cook

Mistborn trilogy - B. Sanderson


In the past I enjoyed:
Some of the dragon lance novels
Some Forgotten Realms novels

ISw3arItWasntM3	18	0	2	"I think that we should start having start and finish dates for the book of each month and for the choosing the book of each month to make it easier for everybody to follow.

Discussions begin on the 1st and end on the last day of the month. This way we're not picking the book of the month half way after that month is already over and so everybody's idea of when to read the book is synchronized.

So for example a topic gets made January 20th. People submit their choices in the comments and upvote the book they want to read. Then, hypothetically, on January 27th **The Final Empire**(Mistborn Book 1) is the highest upvoted comment. That means **The Final Empire** is going to be February's book of the month, discussions starting Feb 1st and ending Feb 28th.

1372021700.0	1gxf4e	Discussion about magic and fantasy worlds		25	6	8	"There are so many wonderful worlds with their own rules, it's really intimidating how much freedom the writers have in this genre, so many fuck it up by various reasons.

That being said I think there are worlds or stories where the way in which magic and the world in general works is memorable. If you can list one someone else hasn't mentioned or properly described, and let's try to make a big fat list of various worlds/series and short description of the unique rules that govern them. 
Of course some series like The First Law Trilogy, Discworld, ASOIAF, Assassin's Apprentice are intentionally vague and you never quite learn the way in which magic works, nor do you need to, this is where we list stuff like Brandon Sanderson's worlds for example.

Ok so after this retarded explanation of what I'm trying to get going here I'll post a few. Why, you ask? Well, because I think describing the world will introduce the series to people looking for interesting settings.
For example, 

**Harry Potter** - wizards have the ability to do magic, they manifest this around the age of 11, and usually they need to use a wand to cast their various spells. Certain abilities are specific to only a few wizards, speaking to serpents for example.

Brandon Sanderson, who's known particularly for his original magic systems and interesting world-building:

**Elantris** - not an incredibly detailed magic system as it's been something forgotten from the past, to cast spells certain people of the world can draw symbols, once these symbols are completed, even in air, the spell is activated or can be triggered by touch

**Warbreaker** - one of the most interesting magic systems that I've read about- In this world every ordinary human has one unit of magic, you could call it a magical soul. Magic is based off of using these souls and transferring them between people, giving life to inanimate objects, with magic that is basically described as color. People who accumulate enough of these souls become stronger and stronger and can do more and more amazing things.

**Stormlight Archives (Way of Kings)** - Still plenty about how the world works is to be discovered, but certain individuals can absorb light, become faster, shift gravity around themselves, basic but very creative for the action that occurs. There are also crystals and forgotten technologies that enable transmutation of materials, certain swords can be summoned from thin air in a matter of heartbeats, and there is a type of power armor, remnants of past ages.

**Mistborn**, **The Alloy of Law** - depending on individual you can have anything from none of all the powers that involve ingesting metals and burning them as fuel for your magic. Allomancers can bend minds by suggesting emotions, they can push or pull on iron, they can become physically strong, and more, all of which involve a distinct metal or alloy. Here particularly in the alloy of law you get more interesting powers from this magic system, including bending time and self healing. It makes for very interesting non-metal weapons that try to nullify this advantage of Allomancers etc.

Ok so much for the Sanderson books.

**Farseer Trilogy**, **Liveship Traders** by Robin Hobb - vaguely detailed but interesting and not too over the top magic, Farseers can go into the minds of people, or creatures, and they are very rare in the world. Inanimate objects can be given life, such as with the Liveships in the liveship traders trilogy. Because magic is so sparse it's almost not worth mentioning here but I think people looking for fantasy with more subtle magic elements will be drawn to these character focused series

**Wheel of Time** by R. Jordan - Women and men use complementary parts of the world's magic, think Yng and Yang. Men channel magic by beating the flow of it into submission, women let themselves be carried off by the river of magic. There are items from past ages that allow channelers to use more and more magic without burning themselves forever from being able to channel. They also ""weave"" elements such as weaving fire to throw fireballs or weaving air to give someone a quick lash. Other than these channelers individuals can speak to wolves, others be chosen by fate itself, thus their actions directly affect the fate of the world, what they do matters in the big picture, and it's up to them to change what's inevitable. This is just briefly explaining or giving a few examples of what is possible, it is another world where the magic is complex but detailed, and not all aspects of it are revealed on purpose by the author.

**Abhorsen Trilogy** by Garth Nix - While there are typical magical users the series focuses on the individual known as the Abhorsen. He is an anti-summoner that can send back undead into death using seven magical bells. Of course this implies that the world also has necromancy around. Also mentioned is the posibility to inscribe weapons for example with words that are effective against undead, and stuff like giving innanimate objects a life of their own.

**Black Company Chronicles** While not having a detailed magic system, there are very powerful and old individuals in the world. Anything from flaming swords, necromancy, spells of destruction are mentioned. One particular thing about the ones that are generally described as powerful sorcerers is that they're a bitch to kill, there are literaly scenes where they're getting torn to shreds and they won't die, even decapitation or impaling them won't make some die. If they can't talk or move their fingers, usually the sorcerers will be unable to cast spells, with a few exceptions. Sorcerers tend to not trust each other and everyone has their own tricks up their sleeves. Powerful magic like the one in this world makes for very amazing battles but it's not over the top or a cop out as it could very easily become, probably why this series is so widely praised.

**Terry Goodkind books** - the gary stu main character wakes up around the 4th book that he's a wizard, which means that if he gets angry wallks can crack because lol so awesome, he defeats evil sorcerers through sheer will alone because he's a gary stu, oh and his girlfriend makes everyone fall in love with her and shoots lighting the end "	t5_2s92h	True

I luckily own my own business which means I can read almost all day if the book gets me hooked, like so many fantasy books do. I feel like I've hit a wall though, I've read so much great fantasy that while the stories are all still good I really need something great right about now. I've been pouring over every amazon fantasy threads trying to find a specific type of book. I've never posted on here, but your tastes always seem to line up with mine when I lurk. I have also read all of the books in the sidebar. Some of them easily being in my top 10 of all time (Way Of Kings, Name of the Wind).

So I am really looking for more adult type coming of age stories with some sort of schooling and great character development. I need a new series like Harry Potter (I know technically YA but books 5,6,7 seemed pretty adult like to me, also they easily had me captivated) or The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. In both series they took a young character with few skills but much potential and molded them through schooling and hard work into amazing characters that I fell in love with. 

Also it does not have to be formal schooling. I think that Night Angel trilogy or The Farseer trilogy molded the young people into characters I personally fell in love with. I love the stories where the character learns a wide variety of skills, from swords to magic, as long as its hard work. Romance is definitely a plus, as long as its not the center of the whole story. 

I hope this makes sense to anyone who loves the type of fantasy I do. Hopefully someone out there can recommend something to keep my interest piqued for a few weeks.

1327436233.0	ouwrd	Looking for specific style of books	buyacasha	19	2	55	"I enjoy reading all sorts of fantasy, but what I usually like most are the ones where the main plot follows the ""young -&gt; powerful magician"" story line. Exactly, the very plot most reviewers would *not* call innovative. And I really mean magician, not some warrior with a magical sword or something along the line- ;) 
I am also not a dragon fan. If there's a dragon or two in a side plot? No problem. Just please don't let the main story revolve around them. 

Here's a few of the books I've read in no specific order.

* Age of five trilogy by Canavan ([This one is basically the very definition of the books I love. Guy or Gal goes out into the world and ends up completely rattling it's political system and *kills of their gods*. I would have killed for a sequel to that series with her being all powerful and such.](/spoiler))

* Wheel of time by Jordan

* All Midkemia books by Raymond Feist ([Boy -&gt; most powerfull mage in the world? Please more.](/spoiler)

* Mistborn trilogy by Sanderson ([Yess.](/spoiler))

* Truth series by Dawn Cook ([Almost a bit dragon'y though](/spoiler))

* Black magicians trilogy by Canavan

* The books by Patrick Rothfuss

* Sword of truth ([Good one. The fact that he controlled a huge empire kind of made up for the fact that he sucked as a warmage ;)](/spoiler))

1365150358.0	1bq0k7	I just read an excellent fantasy trilogy called the “Legends of Muirwood” by Jeff Wheeler.	TomTheNurse	22	5	20	"http://www.amazon.com/Jeff-Wheeler/e/B004SBCEK6/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1/176-5912583-2957904

I was browsing the Amazon fantasy section on my Kindle recently and I came across the “Legends of Muirwood” trilogy by Jeff Wheeler.  What caught my eye is that it had well over 200 reviews and they collectively gave it an over four star average rating.  I read the synopsis, some of the reviews and figured $9.00, (Kindle version price), for the series was worth a shot.  

I am glad I did.  It is not the next “Lord of the Rings”, but it is a very well written and beautiful story.  There is an element of magic, some political intrigue, a bit of a love story, classic good verses evil and such.   

Things I enjoyed about it were the main character was really likeable and the author allowed her to develop and bloom as the story progressed.  I loved the pacing.  There were not 100’s of leagues to be traveled between events so the plot was able to unfold fairly rapidly.  The story was focused almost entirely on one character so there was very little jumping around from character to another.  The story was presented on an almost linear timeline meaning that there was very little jumping backwards and forwards along the plot time line.  Some of the ancillary and supporting characters were delightfully unpredictable.  Just when you thought they were bad, they turned out to be good and vice versa.  

My minor knocks on it were that it was a little hard to get into initially but once it got going, the pace stayed up.  It was fairly predictable overall.  But in a genre such as this, when you read a lot of stories like this, predictability kind of comes with the territory.  

Overall, I love the story and the style in which it was written.  It would have been well worth the cost at twice the price.  I very much look forward to reading more works by this author.  


**TL;DR: Looking for a well written and enjoyable fantasy series that likely you have not heard of?  Try this one.**

1352711103.0	1320zq	Thank you Fantasy_Bookclub!!	Shagga__son_of_Dolf	16	2	13	"Hey, you may or may not have seen [my only other self post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy_Bookclub/comments/11203h/wanted_to_discuss_ask_for_advice_on_some_fantasy/), and this is sort of a followup to it. 

I just really really wanted to **THANKS** to all of you who helped and everyone else too just for being a part of this glorious community. 

I'm almost finished reading the Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny, loved every bit of it (10 books in just over a month!!! that's a personal record) though I liked the Merlin saga better... 

I wanted also to bring up the fact I said about the ""non traditional fantasy"" (with a lot of murders, gore and sex and stuff). While looking for something to read I was 
&gt;Looking for fantasy novels where good / bad isn't always apparent and even in bad there is something good and vice versa.

In russian descriptions to both ASOIAF &amp; The Witcher book series it is said that the books are ""straying away from traditional fantasy"". People have pointed out that 
&gt;every author that isn't crap or from 10 years ago writes like this

Well it turned out not to be entirely true. ""Black and white"" or ""traditional fantasy"" is still being written, and a lot of it (especially many russian authors who don't gain too much international attention), and the ""straying away"" actually is what it is - it is straying away from the previous standards, though not yet becoming in itself a standard. What I didn't know is just how many authors are ""straying"" (turns out A LOT!!). The best part about all this research - I found that there is a special ""series"" (don't know what the proper term or word would be for it) published by one of the publishers called ""Черная Фэнтези"" literal translation being ""Black (dark) Fantasy"" and they publish all those awesome authors that I was looking for!! - Joe Abercrombie, Glenn Cook, Robert Asprin, Richard Morgan and others! IT'S SO FREAKIN AWESOME!!! 

There is a downside to it too - the series is extremely popular among russian fantasy readers but not among general population (like song of ice and fire is for instance) so the books that are published - are being bought out super fast. I ordered all of the books from russia, (I live in Latvia) but chances of getting all of them are slim. But now I'm watching super close on the release dates of new books, and will not miss a single one! Next one to be released is ""Warriors"" a compilation where 3rd Dunk&amp;Egg story is included. 

Phew, I think that's all I wanted to share. As soon as I finish the Amber Chronicles - I'm starting Michael Moorcocks ""Elric Saga"". 


Again, THANK YOU! Everyone! I don't think I'll be giving up reading anytime soon :) 

If anyone is interested.... here's [my current book collection](http://i.imgur.com/CPvjs.jpg). Books that didn't get into the shot - Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny (10 novels in one ginormous book, not on the shelf cause I'm reading it right now) The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie (the only book that I own in english, also the only soft cover) and Harry Potter books (are on the shelf, but to the right from the photo)"	t5_2s92h	True

1324552625.0	nmigl	So my best friend wrote a fantasy novel, 'The Golden Book'.  Come inside and hear his story.  :) I'd like to surprise him this christmas...	thebasicblues	18	4	10	"http://youtu.be/Nv4KPiTFADA

Ok so here goes:

My best friend, Cameron, wrote this really cool book called 'The Golden Book'.  Like most struggling writers/authors he has been working on this first release for years and years, writing bits and pieces of it since as far back as highschool (we're in our late 20s now).  Well, he finally released a hardcover copy of it (printed on double sided 8.5/11, the thing weighed a ton!) a couple of years ago and pretty much invested his life savings into it.  

As you can imagine, the DIY publishing business is a lot of hard work, but he was able to sell it through the local Hastings store in Flagstaff, AZ and at the first friday artwalks that summer.  Unfortunately the winter in Flag that year was the worst of the past 40+, causing the roof to collapse (quite literally) on The Hastings store, and obliterating almost all of his stock.  Being the proud guy that he is, he just kind of accepted that loss.  After that he had to put The Golden Book on the back burner as he discovered he was going to become a father shortly thereafter.  

I don't want to get too personal, but he decided to start focusing more on work and his career and 'growing up'/being responsible and The Golden Book kind of fell to the wayside.  He DID write a couple of short stories, and made this amazing childrens book for his daughter, though.  

http://imgur.com/H0WRl
http://imgur.com/sqj8A


So out of the blue yesterday he sends me a link to a trailer on youtube for The Golden Book and a url showing that I could download it at Barnes and Noble or Smashwords!!!  So cool that he's revisiting the book and with the help of the internet/e-readers he can actually sell it and maybe recoup a few bucks that he's invested into it.  I don't know if this is the right subreddit to be posting all of this, but the man has been such a great friend to me that I thought I'd try to give a little bit back to him this christmas...  

He's selling the book for $0.99 and if you're fans of fantasy and/or for helping out budding authors, then buying a copy would be the coolest gift he could imagine.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you DO buy a copy, thanks SO MUCH for helping out such a nice guy.

Edit: He has no idea that i'm doing this and did I mention he's the nicest guy ever?  One year in college when we were roommates I asked him to record family guy for me cause I was working late.  He did, but recorded over my Pete and Pete tape... I flipped out (which I regret) and then that year for christmas good guy Cameron burnt the ENTIRE SERIES to dvd for me.  We also studied abroad together in The Netherlands, where I currently happily live and work, and I never would've even come over here in the first place if it wasn't for Cam telling me I should join for a semster (what was the worst that could happen?!).  

edit 2: is it a faux pas (did I even spell that right) to post this to another, larger reddit as well?  I don't really know the rules around here and don't want to  shoot myself in the foot, lol.

Also, I considered both to be somewhat ""easy reads"" in that the story immediately gripped me, and I always had a hard time putting the book down. If possible, a completed series would be best since ASOIAF and KC are both leaving me hanging.

After doing a little homework, it seems like one of the following would best best. A push in any direction would be helpful. 

1. Mistborn - I've read that it's a good story, but that the writing may not be of the same quality as ASOIAF/KC.

First, I think it would be fun to read or more likely reread The Hobbit, before the movie comes out.  Second, it isn't very long and people could possibly even read it while reading another novel.  Third, it is probably one of the easiest books to find in just about any form you would like.  For instance a library, audiobook, torrents, amazon, your own bookshelf.  Fourth, it may bring others to the subreddit and increase the size of the community due to the movie's marketing.  Finally, it is one of my favorite stories ever, and it would be awesome to do some sort of reread with a large number of people.
Cons
First, the Hobbit is not likely to expand our own horizons, as I assume most of us have read the book.  Second, it could overexpand the subreddit leading to terrible future choices.

FragCakes	15	5	29	"Okay, like the title says, I recently bought my self a kindle from Amazon. And I've been reading a lot more, since I find reading with a kindle more convenient than a book (reading in the dark, no carrying around thick 1000+ page books (i'm looking at you Brandon Sanderson)).

Anyway, since I've gotten a kindle I've been on a binge reading some of my old favorites from high school. Elantris, The Inheritance cycle, Harry Potter, and recently I picked up another Brandon Sanderson book, The Way of kings, and I am nearly done with it.

Normally, I am slow to get into new books because I see them as a time investment. But I hope a little help from you guys would find me some books to read to get me out of that mind set and get more comfortable trying new ones out.

I enjoy high fantasy like the setting in the Way of Kings. The strange and fascinating world of high storms chasmfiends. The great magic system and the artifacts that are shard plate and shard blades.

I like the kind of story where someone, some how ""ascends"". They become something greater or become apart of something greater. Or gets thrust into a world that person has to quickly adapt to.

I really enjoyed the politics in the way of kings, pretty smart. Nothing is ever simple and the distinction between light eyes and dark eyes is pretty interesting as well.

Another thing I really like about Brandon Sanderson is his very proactive characters, I fucking love Kaladin Stormblessed and Raoden."	t5_2s92h	True

I did not enjoy George R. R. Martin's series **A Song of Ice and Fire** as much as I had hoped I would. My roommate had been recommending the books to me for years, and prior to the series premiere of the HBO show, I read them. 

I felt as though the writing was mediocre, at best; the plot was slow and stagnant at times. To me, it became repetitive. When book 5 came out this past summer I thought *now maybe this one is better... after all, GRRM certainly took his time writing it.* Ultimately, I was wrong. Knowing that the most recent book's time-line overlaps that of the previous book I still closed the novel feeling jipped, almost conned into buying yet another book that offered me very little.

Not too long ago I came across a used book store and found [these](http://i.imgur.com/SyHvKsN.jpg) two gems (among other things).

These 2 books contain the first 4 novels by Steve Perry - Earth Hive, Nightmare Asylum, The Female War, Genocide.

Finally I picked up the first one (got so many unread books right now...) and wanted to share my thoughts with you. These are pretty damn good! 

The books pick up right after Aliens. First one was written in 1992, the same year Alien 3 was made, so you can consider the end of Aliens - a fork in the road, and further Alien movies and Alien novels are two different roads.

It doesn't feature any of the original characters, though it does mention the events of both movies. The plot is sort-of similar to Aliens but definitely stands on its own, and the ending is great though yet again similar to the movie (in more aspects than one). Overall it's definitely what you'd expect - it's an action novel. The futuristic technology is there, but it's not the focus, and the human emotions are there but they're also not the focus, the focus is the action. I'm just about finished with the 2nd novel, and the if I was happy with the 1st, the 2nd is a bit formulaic (new crazy general as the enemy, people trying to tame aliens rather than destroying them etc) but none the less it's still super readable. Not boring at all. 

Also I must mention the writing style. It's very uhm... I don't know the proper term or word for this. It's basically like a movie, almost everything is split into scenes (which in this case definitely works in the books favor, rather than the opposite) I'll try to elaborate as best as I can - you know when you watch a movie and there's an intense battle scene or something? The focus shifts from the ""action"" to some generals or whatever looking at it and discussing it, then shifts to action, shows good guys reaction, shows bad guys reaction, a few hits, then shows generals again etc... It's been done in many books, I know, but in these it really stands out, it's even specially separated like that, every little scene. It's different but it's not bad (at least I didn't think so)

So overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi with huge emphasis on action (or just a fan of Aliens who likes to read books) and happen to come across these - don't dismiss them. They're good!"	t5_2s92h	True

1327523692.0	owim7	Just read Shadow and Claw by Gene Wolfe. Having a hard time understanding why it is rated so high. [SPOILERS]	Asian_Persuasion	13	2	18	"I just want another person's perspective here as to why it is so highly rated as a fantasy book. Here's my take on it:

The whole plot seemed very flimsy to me. I can barely piece together any kind of semblance of a story. Everything that happened to him seems only marginally related to the actual journey Severian is taking. The talk with the green man seemed to serve nothing but give a little philosophical and as a tool to move the story forward. Then there are the mirrors in the story that seem to do nothing but show the fact that interplanetary travel is possible using them. What I mean to say is that Wolfe seems to just write these elements with no relation to one another.

For instance, the giants are some kind of godlike beings, Badlanders being a growing one, are an ancient race that are somehow going to die with some kind of coming apocalypse. This is just my take based on what was said when the giant lady in the Gyoll tries to take him near the end of the book in addition to what happened in the play in the House Absolute. This is in the hopes that the play actually had some kind of significance to the story and was not just a waste of space. After having figured that out, despite probably being wrong, I still do not see any actual relation between the giants and Severian. I want to assume that Severian is important because that giant lady wants him, but other than that one part there seems to be no relation between Severian and the giants.

There also seems to be no fleshing out of anything besides Severian in here. I want to say that is understandable seeing as this is an autobiography, but Wolfe seems to have it set up so that no one truly wants to even give any explanation of anything. We don't really know why the Autarch and Vodalus are having their war, even though Vodalus is well known and is, at least to me, an important part of the story. Nearly nothing is known about Father Inire and the Autarch himself. Severian also, strangely, does not seem interested in the fact that the Autarch and Vodalus are not only cooperating, but are answering to a higher power. Then the Claw isn't really discussed and is only used as a method of healing.

My point is, Shadow and Claw reads like a weak plot propelled forward by even weaker, and unrelated, plot elements with no history or backstory behind anything. I'll take any ideas on this and/or criticisms of my analysis.

**EDIT: All I am asking for is what you personally got from the story that I seem to have missed. Examples of some subtle symbolisms that seem to draw the story together or give some of the side elements some backstory. I already understand there are more books, but if I have read half of the book to come to the conclusion I have, I must have missed something or this book is highly overrated.**"	t5_2s92h	True

I'm basically looking for good modern fantasy novels to read. To help pinpoint the suggestions (because there are obviously thousands of fantasy novels), I kind of wrote out what I like below. 

1) So far I've finished the Harry Potter books (I know that's obvious but I'm not sure if it fits in fantasy), the LOTR trilogy as well as the Hobbit, and I just picked up The Magicians by Lev Grossman, as well as A Game of Thrones (everyone is telling me to read it). I also recently read The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern which was fantasic. Not sure if it fits in traditional fantasy but books similar to that would be awesome

2) I like novels that have some sort of ""magic""-fantasy to them. Magic doesn't necessarily need to take the central role, but any fantasy novel involving magic is something that I would love to read! Also anything involving Merlin is awesome!

3) I HIGHLY prefer series over standalone novels, I feel multiple books give a good sense of growth of characters etc. (I'm assuming these are called epics, but I am not good with my terminology)

4) I don't mind reading novels aimed at any age - that includes youth-literature

5) I also do enjoy horror-fantasy as well, but I absolutely despise science-fiction. I can't do futuristic advanced-techno babble.

Please don't let the above suggestions stop you from recommending a book that you enjoyed!

Then I read the goodreads reviews for The Magicians on Goodreads and was a little surprised to see the book rated pretty low there.  It was also on several worst books of all times lists. I guess I shouldn't have been all that surprised, it is pretty depressing and Quentin is very unlikable, but I felt it was well enough written (especially when you compare it to some stuff out there (maybe Twilight, (although I hate to jump on that bandwagon))).

I think I can figure out what books most people like pretty easily:
Name of the Wind

The Lies of Locke Lamora

Malazan (I haven't gotten to this one yet but it's on my list.)

(Maybe the Black Company Chronicles)

All of Brandon Sanderson's stuff

1329264487.0	ppwfd	Beta-Readers Wanted - Nine Worlds	Runarthor	13	3	7	"Hey guys,
I'm Runar Thor, or R.Thor as I like to call myself. You may have seen my other thread ""Nine Worlds - A Shameless Plug"". If you haven't then allow me to state that I am an aspiring fantasy writer and the owner of www.nineworldsbooks.com. Nine Worlds is a fantasy universe I've been creating now for around 2 years and it's based intimately upon Norse Mythology. 

Anyway, to the point! I'm Icelandic so I don't speak English as a mother language. It's more just something I've picked up throughout my childhood by watching American cartoons without subtitles and of course my adolescent gaming years. Regardless, I write all my stories in good old English in order to broaden my horizon. The fantasy reader market in Iceland is small and I want (like all writers do) as many people as I can to read my works. Which is why I have a slightly bigger obstacle to climb over than English or American aspiring writers, but that won't stop me!

So here is my call out to fantasy readers! I need beta-readers to assist me by providing feedback on my works before I publish them on the website. I will credit each person who presents a review and make sure their assistance is recognized. 

What I'm looking for in a beta-reader:

* Someone who isn't afraid to voice their opinion. (Obviously)
* Honesty. I want to hear the truth and nothing but the truth. I'd much rather have you hurt my feelings and NOT publish a bad piece of work rather than you sparing my feelings and embarrassing me to my readers. (A writer more than often misses obvious flaws in his works that others catch.) 
* Someone who can provide ""constructive"" criticism. I can't stress this enough. As much as I want honesty, I don't appreciate cruelty for the sake of being cruel.

1324182704.0	nh12h	(Game of Thrones) Jon Snow Parentage Theories [NO SPOILERS!]	ManagerOfFun	18	7	22	"Here's my thoughts: we know that Ned Stark claims that Jon Snow is his bastard and never discusses who his mother was. We know Jon Snow looks like a Stark.
We know that Ned has bad dreams about Lyanna, and how he promised her... something, we don't know what.

My theory: Ned is too good a person to cheat on his wife. What if Jon Snow's Stark parent was Lyanna, and the father was Robert Baraethon? Or worse, the Mad King, what'shisface Taergaryen? We know that Rob loved Lyanna, and that Taergaryen kidnapped her, which was a big reason for the war. When Ned finally freed Lyanna, she was being kept in a tower with a bunch of knights, and she was dying. Ned went home from this war with a baby Jon Snow. What if Lyanna was dying from childbirth? 
This leaves the question of why Ned claimed Jon Snow as his bastard. If Jon's father is King Robert, it would be to protect Jon from the Lannisters. If Jon's father is King Taergaryen, it would be to protect Jon from Robert. 
So why take Jon home and raise him as your own, rather than just finding him a farming family to take him in? My theory: Because Lyanna made Ned promise to raise Jon as his own.

It's an elemental based book, so the characters have the normal powers of Fire, Earth, Water, Air, and they throw in Spirit for good measure. I remember that the character with Fire was a female. At the start of the book, each of the characters are in a competition. Once they win, they are taken to a house where they start to learn how to merge their powers. It's thought by everyone else that only the four elements can combine, but they discover how to combine all five. When they do, a new consciousness is created.

I was picking up ""Mask of Cthulhu"" in the book store (my local network of bookstores has a website where you can order a book and have it delivered to a specific shop free of charge) and the overly attached book store clerk started hitting me with recommendations, like do you like Lovecraft? Well you should read this and this and this. Typically I don't like it when clerks do that, but this guy seemed like he really knew what he was talking about, and wasn't trying to *just sell* me more books. However I already have quite a backlog of unread stuff so I was like ""nah man, nooo, nah, no, maybe next time"" but he kept insisting, so I picked the cheapest book he was offering, a small paperback ""James Rollins: Excavation"" (~4,38$). 

Since it's rather not large I decided - might aswell read it and get it out of the way - HOLY FAKE TITS ON A ZOMBIE fellow readers! This book is fucking amazing!

It started off a bit slow (and I gotta say I'm not the biggest fan of the whole treasure hunting / indiana jones archaeology) but when the characters were set and the actual ""action"" started - the mystery actually became interesting! I swear here I am not caring about who this found dead guy is and 50 something pages later ""OMG! Who is he?!! WHY WAS HE THERE? I MUST KNOW!!"" 

I read about 1/3 of the book in one sitting (196 pages out of 540) and I guess the only thing that bothered me was - there was quite a big chunk without anything fantasy/mysticism related, it was all quite realistic. Now something HAS happened, and I can't wait to find out what it means. 


If you're looking for a great adventure book - this is it! I can't recommend it enough! And from now on - I'll be getting most of my books from that obsessive clerk person, he knows his books god dammit!!


Did you read it? Did you find it as awesome as I did? Let's discuss! And if you haven't read it, I hope I interested you enough with this wall of text, hehe. Cheers!

I am desperately looking for a new magic heavy (preferably complete) series to read, I've exhausted all the authors I enjoy but maybe someone can open my eyes to something new.

Likes:
Author: Sanderson
 I love his system of magic having read all of ""The Stormlight Archive"" and ""Mistborn"" books.

Author: Modesitt
His recluse series of books of which I've read them all were superb.

Author: P.V. Brett
The Painted Man and Desert spear have me craving the next book

Author: Rothfuss
His kingkiller chronicles were a treat.

Author: Jim Butcher
The dresden series of books whilst the magic system was not my usual cup of tea the characters made up for its difference.

Dislikes:
Lord of the rings - Just didnt do it for me, I like serious characters.

Harry Potter - I really cant make it through the magic system, it is juvenile to me.

Since its release years ago It has claimed the top spot on my list of fantasy book series. Without a doubt it's incredible.  Thankfully, the series is 4 books long, so it isn't too short or overly long.  Three of which are already out and the final being released in just twenty days (I know I hate reading incomplete series so have no fear!).  It's filled with romance if your into just that, but its really not just about that at all. All of the books feature elements that the guys will enjoy, such as thievery, wizardry and swordplay.  You'll truly be caught up within the universe. The characters are definitely the best part of the entire thing because each has an individual personality that helps affect the world.

The first book can be found here if you're interested:

One thing to note is that if you're afraid of reading a book from multiple perspectives or just dislike it in general I'd say to give this one a chance. It really does it in such a way that leaves you anxiously waiting for the POV switch.

I have sent a couple unfinished copies to my friends, and they think it's pretty good and I should keep working on it, but I would like others opinions.

WARNINGS:

1. This is an unfinished copy and therefore has miss-spellings, and most likely grammar and punctuation errors (Please overlook these, and maybe even point them out).

2. I don't know if this would be SFW or NSFW, mainly because there are some paragraphs that are a little ""sexual"", but they don't go into much detail.

3. It might have some names that are overused, or used in other book/movies/videogames, but I'm not looking to publish it, just to write and have a good read once it is finished. (EDIT)

So with all that said here is the download link: http://www.mediafire.com/?2667vjmwifyosr7

1313797029.0	jodo0	Which books should I read on a 17 hour flight (to and back?)	Yawner	9	1	41	"I've bought the following books for my Kindle, but I'm saving them for a long plane trip to the US in 2 months time:

1. Brandon Sanderson's ""The Way of Kings"" / ""The Mistborn Series"" / ""Warbreaker""
2. Patrick Rothfuss's ""The Name of the Wind""
3. Andrzej Sapkowski's ""Blood of Elves""
4. Scott Lynch's ""The Lies of Locke Lamora""
5. George R. R. Martin's ""A Game of Thrones""
6. Glen Cook's ""The Black Company""
7. Peter V. Brett's ""The Desert Spear""

Thus, my main question:


**Since I'll have roughly 34 hours of on-flight reading time (coming to and back from the US) -- and in addition to that, all those hours that are to be spent waiting for and in buses and trains while I visit several US states -- in which order would you suggest I read the above novels? The criteria is... uhh, maximum continuous pleasure.**


Some other considerations:

- As I've seen A Game of Thrones on TV, I wonder whether I should read the book at all now, especially if the book doesn't contain anything that's too fundamentally different from the TV series?
- I really, really, *really* enjoyed my reading of Elantris, and that book made me a fan of Brandon Sanderson. Any more books like that would be appreciated. 
- I've read ""The Last Wish"" by Sapkowski. It was a great read in the beginning, but then seemed to drag on with unenjoyable philosophical conundrums (to me at least) as the book reached its end. Should I read ""Blood of Elves"", its sequel, therefore? 
- I loved Peter V. Brett's ""The Warded Men"", but that one unexpected [spoiler] rape scene [/spoiler] in the first book left me rather depressed for a couple of days. Since I'll be on a flight in a rather happy mood, should I be reading its sequel? I'd prefer that I not dismount from the flight all glum and sour due to depressing surprises.
- Recommend me reads that are especially funny (in that sharp/smart/sly way) and happy! 

Also, feel free to discourage me from reading any of the books above or to recommend any other novels you think I should read."	t5_2s92h	True

1349553848.0	11203h	Wanted to discuss / ask for advice on some fantasy novels (sorry if not appropriate for this subreddit)	Shagga__son_of_Dolf	9	2	33	"Greetings. 

I just recently finished The Witcher Saga, and am looking for something else to read what would be in the same vein. 

Wall of text on what I actually mean by that (also some background on my reading in general):

I was never much of a reader, but well I got the first harry potter book and followed the series since, when the last one was translated to russian and read - that's it, my reading ended. 

More recently I got a hold of the first Song of Ice and Fire book, and that pretty much blew my mind. I read all of them except ADWD since that is due to be released in october here. (no, I don't watch the show)

When I finished those books - I just had this huge empty space that I needed to fill with more reading. The first thought came quickly - Lord of the rings, it's so popular so it just has to be good right? (never seen the movies) But I was severely disappointed with the LotR books. I bought the 3in1 all novels in one book, but I couldn't even get to half of fellowship of the ring, because it was boring. Now again it may not be the books fault - just a bad translation which doesn't quite tell the story in the way author intended it, but I don't have any other options since reading in English is very difficult (I can't really explain it, more or less reading a novel is very different from say reading a forum post). 

I was browsing the local online book store when a book caught my attention - a 7 in 1 all books about The Witcher, two short story compilations as well as all five novels in the actual ""saga"". I remembered that the game Witcher 2 made a lot of hype and was nominated for multiple game of the year awards, so I cringed at the price a bit but bought that book. The book is bigger than a yellow pages catalogue.... and it costed ~74$ (converted by google). And all 7 are the greatest books I ever read (fact that I read very little aside...). 

**The Witcher**
It's setting is pretty close to what song of ice and fire is, (I'm guessing many of you read ASOIAF since ADWD is mentioned in the sidebar) in that it's partially historical fiction, setting is very reminiscent of middle age europe (East/Northern europe to be exact) only there is much more magic/creatures. Other similarities include - different PoW (though definitely not as much as GRRM, because there is one main character) a lot of very detailed violence, sex scenes (not as detailed :( ), there is a great war that is tearing apart the kingdoms both with the aggressor and amidst themselves, but the main and the MOST important thing - there is practically no good and evil. I mean sure there is a lot of evil, and there are a lot of people who are trying to do good, but the evil characters are not exclusively evil (or their plans are not always ultimately evil) and good characters a lot of times have bad sides to them. I mean - it's not always US vs. THEM (and who are WE and who are THEY is not always apparent) there is no black and white in characters, there are mostly tons and tons of gray. That is what kept me reading all the way through (cause a lot of times the writing style did get tedious, nowhere near as good as GRRM) it's very much like (how I think) it was in the middle ages - people were just trying to survive, not live a ""good life"" (what even IS a good life?). 


Phew... are you still with me? :) 

So I was wondering if this kind community could recommend to me something to read, considering all of the above stated. Preferably something that you know had international releases since I'm going to be reading in Russian.

**TL;DR**

Looking for fantasy novels where good / bad isn't always apparent and even in bad there is something good and vice versa. Thinking - Song of Ice and Fire, The Witcher. Preferably something that you know had an international release, cause I can't read books in English. (And I am willing to try again, but I like to read books on actual books, my attempts were with an e-reader on my android phone, it's impossible to get books here in english unless I import)"	t5_2s92h	True

The background had to do with some future technological disaster that turned earth into five separate worlds, each inhabited by one of the traditional fantasy races.  There were also two super-human races, one that used magical rune tattoos, and the other one more like your traditional crystal spires and toga society.  The two super races had a longstanding war.

The main story of the book had to do with an assorted crew on a submarine in the 'elf' world, where people lived in stone spheres underwater.  There was some guy that was a reject from the crystal spires and togas race, but turned into a Dragon at the very end.  I think there was also a chapter where a tattoo magic guy had to escape from some sort of maze, and got hurt or something, and his mentor had to perform magic laser tattoo removal and redo them all.

It was all very strange, I was like 14 and hadn't read any real fantasy before, so I'm not even sure if it was any good, but I've been trying to find the name of the book because I think there were sequels.  Does this ring a bell to anyone?"	t5_2s92h	True

The Castle is the core of a somewhat federal style government of four nations who are all variations of humans, some are adept to the cold and night, others have wings (albeit cannot fly, except in the case of the Comet) and others are plain humans. The book is set during the peak of a two thousand year old war between this nation and the Insects. The 50 Immortals comprise of the best-in-class of their respective professions; The Comet for example, is the fastest messenger in the empire due to a unique mix of parenting and possess a gift for languages. Others include the Archer, Swordsman, Architect, Doctor etc. Not a fan of the pacing towards the end and some of the plot elements were a tad bizarre, but it left plenty to explore to the other books in the series, which comprises of 2 other novels and a prequel thus far. Would love to hear others thoughts on it.	t5_2s92h	True

1343161980.0	x3bmo	Fantasy/Sci-Fi book for kids on the autism spectrum	btashima	10	4	4	"I’ve written and self-published a book called Secret of the Songshell, a young adult sci-fi/fantasy about a teenage guitarist with Asperger’s Syndrome who travels to an alternate world where his unique brain waves can be combined with the sound waves of music to create magical effects.

I originally wrote it for my son (who has Asperger’s), but after I finished it, I realized that I had created a fictional hero for kids on the autism spectrum — someone who saves the day with his special qualities, not despite them, and a character that they can relate to and gain a sense of coolness and empowerment from.

I’ll be donating a portion of profits from book sales to Autism Empowerment, a non-profit organization that works to promote autism awareness and education (www.autismempowerment.org).

Anyway, if this sounds interesting to you, please check it out at www.thespectralandsaga.com – there’s a sample chapter and links to the Amazon pages where it’s for sale in both print and Kindle versions. Let me know what you think (honest feedback is welcome and appreciated).

Thanks!

I read this fantasy book when I was in middle school (eight years ago) I don't remember all of it but I remember one key part and the beginning and the ending I hope this will help.

The beginning started out with a teenager wanting to contact his friend with his mind to tell his house but knew that his friend could not respond in the same way because (Not because he did not possess magical abilities) but because that was not one of his powers.

When they meet at the teenagers house, the teenager and his mother try an experiment to see if the friend has any magical powers at all and at this point the town finds out that they are doing a magical experiment and try to burn down the house.  The teenager's mother creates a rain cloud to drive away the crowd.

One important part I remember is this woman explaining that some people can use magic, but it is like a sprinkle where the can do small magic and very often while the other extreme is the magic is ""poured on them"" and they can only use it once.

Now the ENDING I remember.

Remember the teenagers friend I spoke about earlier?  Well his magic power is to trade his body for his friends when they were dead and at the end of the book the teenager's friend trades his life for the life of his four friends when they were on the verge of death.


If you know this book, thank you very much.  Also if this is the wrong thread to ask can someone please point me in the right direction?

How did you like Elantris? I like it a lot so far, plot keeps moving forward at great pace, characters are very vivid and likable even if you dont share their point of view, world is big enough, and I believe I will be getting my feet wet with magic pretty soon ;) 

Book is a single read, and is great brake if you are jumping from one big series to another. I regret having read Mistborn before Elantris though, because I have a feeling that Brandon was.. *practicing* in Elantris. Some aspects just seem *so familiar* after reading Mistborn, such as:

* Strong female character not very good at blending in usual social entourage
* Strong male character of royal background falling for her
* Strong male character is an intelectual leader of small group of royal dissidents 
* Seons vs Kandras, fog/ash vs grime

In spite of it being an 800 page beast I'm hoping to get it done within a couple of weeks so I can get back to reading Shogun and finish the second half of that thousand page colossus.

And while I'm at taking care of business with unfinished books, there's three more on my shelf that I have yet to finish (One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Silmarillion, The Fall of Hyperion) before I can catch up all the way with ASOIAF, or for that matter the Otherland series, of which I have also read only the first book and the second is waiting on my shelf.

Once I get all that out of the way I can *finally* turn my attention to that Malazan Book of the Fallen series I've been eyeballing for a few years now (approximately ten thousand pages total upon it's completion) before I read book 2 onwards of that Wheel of Time stuff everyone's talking about (that'll be another thirteen books, 800-1000 pages per book on average).

If I'm still alive by the time I get all that done, I'm aching to read the bulk of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books (the number of which is getting close to 40, though they're typically no bigger than 400 pages).

It's odd having all this ahead of me because every now and again I'll hear of certain things that sound cool like the Gap Cycle or the Night's Dawn trilogy, Black Company, Thomas Covenant, Book of the New Sun, The Chronicles of Amber or Belgeriad, and choosing to add even a few of these to a committed list of books to read that list has easily grown past *one hundred books*.

And then there's also Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, the Ender's Game series, the Dune series, and an assortment of historical fiction books like Pillars of the Earth or The Far Pavillions, or those from Gary Jennings or James Clavell.

Northern Lights (His Dark Materials)

Wizard's first rule (sword of truth) (reading it now)

I want to finish the SoT book, finish name of the wind and then read the next book of the WoT series. But I feel like I'm juggling too many balls at the same time.

1333788915.0	rxopc	My Epic Fantasy novel	ZCYancy	6	7	0	"Out of the Oven is my first novel (with many more to come). It's the first in a trilogy, and draws from all mythologies while keeping a completely original story. It's set in a 60 years post-apocalyptic world, where creatures from all mythologies roam and a black veil covers the sky. The main character is a young man named Aldous Kaine who is forced to rid the world of the creatures. It's a fast-paced and exciting for anybody who loves fantasy. 

It's only 99 cents on Kindle, $14 paperback. I also have frequent free days where it's free on Kindle.

1326757211.0	ojzuo	Help me get back into reading fantasy with some suggestions, please ! =)		1	1	2	"Hello !
After quite a big break from reading ( simply because other things took place) I'm now 100% in the mood (and got the time) to get back to some awesome time sitting relaxed in my bed and reading a great fantasy novel!
I would really like some suggestions though!

Here are some books I've read and enjoyed:

Harry Potter series: I've read them quite a long time ago, so I don't know how much I would enjoy them if I read them now. I loved them at the time, although I hated the last book. One thing that I also don't like on this series is the fact that we are not given any limits to what is possible within the magical world. There always seems to be one more magic or some magical object when it is needed to solve something within the plot, and I really don't like this sort of thing.

A Song of Ice and Fire: I only read the first 3 books, and while I loved them, it also for some reason got a bit tiresome, it just drags a bit to much in some places, so I will definitely get back to it, but not now. What I liked the most about these books were the characters and the way the fantasy aspect was handled. It played allot with dark magic, and it was something very controlled and there seems to be some limits about it, which I think it's awesome and makes it more mystical and frightning

His Dark Materials: I'm just finishing the last book of this now. I'm really divided on this one. I think that there is allot of heart on these books and I love many of the ideas and characters, but some things just seemed so out of place after the first one. In the first book we had this world which was similar to ours in many ways but with some fantastical elements, and I really liked it, and I think that the whole mystery of Dust was also really nice, but I feel like things just got out of control when Angels and all that sort of thing came into place out of nowhere, it just felt so off at the time...just didn't seem to fit, in my opinion. 
At some points the books also seemed a bit childish for me ( I'm 22 ). I don't mind young protagonists, so I can't really put my finger on what made me feel that way.

Chronicles of Conan ~- I've read many of the short stories and I loved them. I really like dark fantasy and Conan has allot of it :). The only problem is that I don't really like short stories, and prefer something like an epic trilogy.

I've also read the first book in the sci-fi Hyperion series and loved it, and I will read the rest. However at the moment I'm more in a fantasy mood!

So if you guys could give me any recommendations it would be great!

Thank you so much in advance!
Take good care!"	t5_2s92h	True

I'm kind of new to reddit and mainly use it for some of my gaming journalism news as I am a journalist. With the new year now having started I've been trying to find ways to promote my own fantasy book and thought of running promotions at forums where I can give away a few eBooks of my work.

But the problem with this is then I just end up being a spammer. I hate spammers myself and hate it when guys just butt in on forums with their stuff and act as if that's ok.

So I'm not going to post anything for this first post of mine - no link or anything like that. I'm just going to ask how much regulars here would welcome that sort of thing. What I'd like to do, to add value to the forums, is give away some eBooks to anyone who responds to my thread (probably another thread, not this one). Give away five or so. 

My book is epic fantasy and I'm getting some really great feedback from readers, so I'm feeling much more confident that the book is really as good as I tried to make it :)

Anyway, let me know if this would be considered too spammy or if anyone wants to once again give an indie author a bash and would be keen to even get the eBook for nothing with a little competition here. I know eBooks aren't that popular, most of us prefer the paper thing, but I just don't have the kind of money required to buy and post print versions and do a full on campaign like that.

Ok, enough talking from my side. Will you all hate me if I do this?"	t5_2s92h	True

Does the book community of reddit have anything similar?  Been looking to get my hands on the Song of Fire and Ice series and my local library never has them.
