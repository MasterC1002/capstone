I think it would be good if we could get some comprehensive guides that we could compile into this post, and maybe add it to the sidebar so newer people can better understand the ropes.

It seems like a lot of people are willing to purchase a Gopro, and are really happy with the camera, until they offload their clips onto the computer and realize its not nearly as good as what Gopro has on their YouTube page.

I use an Adobe workflow, so I will start but **it would also be great to get other people's opinions/workflows** for programs such as Avid, Vegas, FCP, and others.  **Also feel free to suggest improvements to workflows as well as video's that have helped you learn more such as tutorials on slow motion, color correcting etc.**  I will make sure to give credit, when credit is deserved.



So I will start:



Description:

* I primarily film snowboarding, skiing, wakeboarding, wakeskating, and occasionally skateboarding.  So the Gopro makes a great action camera for me, and allows me to get close in on the action.

* I use Adobe CS6, which consists of After Effects, Premiere Pro, Encore, Soundbooth, Audition, Speedgrade, and occasionally Photoshop.  I also use Gopro's free Cineform software.  Lastly, I use a few plugins for some of the programs.  In after effects I use the following programs: Twixtor, Twitch, Magic Bullet Looks, and Optical Flares.


* I originally had a Gopro Hero for my filming and I often filmed at 720p 60fps.  However it is important to note, that when filming in lower light or cloudy conditions, step the frame rate down to allow more light to enter the shutter.  If your frame rate is too high, and not enough light is getting to the camera, then your clips will look dark, and it will be harder to correct in post.





Now for the workflow:

/u/xdamanx's Workflow With Adobe CS6 and Gopro Cineform
-------

-----

Part 1 - Gopro Cineform
-----

1.  I start by shooting my footage, I try to use a large variety of mounts and in as many creative ways as possible.  One of the most important rules I follow, is if I have a chance to mount the camera upside down, I do.  This allows the weight of the camera to help stabilize the camera.  

2. I try and use high quality SD cards, this isn't as important for the original hero, but with the Hero2 and especially the black Hero3, it will be very important to have at least a Class 10 card.  I recommend looking on amazon for them as their prices tend to be fairly reasonable.

3.  After shooting my footage, the first step I take is to put them on a computer.  If you are serious about your video editing, it is best to use a ""scratch disk"" to store your footage on.  This removes bandwidth issues when you edit and will help speed up your workflow.  I was able to scavenge up 4 250gb disks that I have set up to act as Scratch Disks.  This enables your editing program to work more efficiently and helps remove hard drive bottlenecking.


 I like to put my footage into a folder system that allows me to easily understand how things work.  I start by creating a top level folder called something such as ""Gopro"" or ""Media"".  Inside of that I like to put the year, for example ""2012"".  Inside of that folder I put the event name such as ""Fernie_Snowboarding_March"".  I use underscores and capital letters for my folders so that they are easier to read.  Inside of that folder I create a folder called ""RAW"".  Inside this folder I put all the footage off of the SD card.  It's called RAW because its footage that still needs to be sorted through, and has yet to be edited.  I also like to create other folders that I will talk about later in my workflow such as ""Colored"", ""Transcoded"", and ""Output"".


4. After I have put my footage in the RAW folder, I go ahead and open up the Gopro Cineform Studio application.  Once inside, I go ahead and import all of my footage, and begin to start to sort out my cuts.  I start by going into the ""Advanced Settings"" box, and changing a few settings:

* I usually leave the frame size at the original setting, in my case this is usually 720p.  However yours may be different.

* I change the frame rate to 23.976, I know several people like 29.97 but I prefer the ""film"" look.  It also allows for a slight increase in slow motion percentage.

* I leave the ""Speed Up"" box blank.

* I set the file format to ""MOV"", this isn't really a crucial step, as premiere has great support for both, but after conducting a few quality tests I have found that the MOV format works a little better for uploads to websites such as Youtube and Vimeo, whereas AVI tends to be better for DVD's and other physical media.

* For the quality box, its up to you, I have an abundance of space and a powerful computer so I set this to High, however medium will be more then fine for most of you.  It really depends on how capable your computer is of editing the file, as well as the hard drive space you have.

* I tick the ""remember settings"" box so that it saves my settings for all of my clips.

After hitting ok, I then proceed to making a few other adjustments:

* I can hit the Rotate/Flip box if I need to flip my clip.  (The gopro has an upside down mode, but I occasionally forget to change it. Remember that its important to film upside down for the best stability.)

* I change the ""save to"" directory to wherever its applicable.  This is usually an external hard drive.  This time though I put it into a ""transcodes"" folder in the same level as the RAW folder.  (So it looks like: D:\Gopro\2012\Project_Name\Transcodes)

* I change the file name, to describe the clip.  It's really personal preference as to how you wish to do this.  I like to use effective names to describe it such as: PersonsName_WhatTheyAreDoing_RatingOutOf5.  So it may look something like: Josh_DownRail_4.

* I then click the ""Add Clip To Conversion List"" box.  When I have done this to all of my clips, I click the ""Convert All"" box.  Usually I then go eat something, watch some TV, or do something else while my computer transcodes my footage.  When its finished, this portion is complete.  I don't use the ""Edit"" function of the Cineform application as I use Premiere Pro for that.


Premiere CS6
-----



With any video editing program, I find that its best to watch some videos on youtube, and then play around in the program similar to a ""Sandbox"".  Explore around in the program, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.  Find out what each tool does, and how effects work, and become familiar with the program.  This is the basis of becoming better at content creation.  When you edit videos, its a personal task, you are in charge of making the cuts, coloring the video, and choosing which shot goes where.  


Now this part of the guide is going to assume you have a basic understanding of how to navigate around in the program, as well as how to use some of the tools.  This part won't go too in depth specifically on how to edit your videos, but rather parts specific to gopro.


So lets begin:


* When you installed the Gopro Cineform application, you also installed Codecs that are specifically for the Gopro, it helps enhance the productivity of your workflow by allowing your computer to work more efficiently.  So when I first open up Premiere I start by creating a new project.  A new dialog box will open up, with 2 tabs.  The first tab is where you can set the project file name, as well as where to save the project.  The second tab is also important.  This is the scratch disks, if you have an external hard drive with available space, consider using this as your scratch disk to improve your performance.

* After creating the project, a new dialogue box will open up, in here we want to change some settings to match our gopro's video.  Start by clicking on the Settings tab.  [Then match up your settings with these](http://imgur.com/5tPh4), tabs in green will remain the same for all of your gopro footage, and tabs in orange will vary based on your resolution, and destination frame rate.  Also make sure you save your preset for future use. After this, give your sequence a name and then press ok.

* After this point, your settings should be correct and you are ready to begin editing, I won't go into too much detail beyond this, perhaps at one point I will expand this part of the guide.  For this part I highly recommend you watch some Youtube videos for more information.

This is going to change soon. 

Starting with the for sale thread. I have registered [r/GoProMarket](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoProMarket/). This is where you can post all your gear for sale or any deals you find. This will keep /r/GoPro clear of for sale style posts.

The next rule won't go into effect right away. Basically we want to cut down on the same type of questions. What SD card should I get? What is a good microphone? What GoPro should I get? These type of posts will be cut down thanks to a FAQ page. The FAQ page is in the works and will be going live on 11/17. It will be constantly worked on, content added to it as we go. Posts that ask for information that is clearly answered in the FAQ should be dealt with accordingly. 


What I don't want to happen is turn this subreddit into a heavily moderated one. That's what the voting system is for and the mods have done a pretty good job here staying neutral. These new rules recognize this idea. 

Going forward I want to do a better job maintaining this subreddit and updating the FAQ. 

If you have any questions or suggestions for other rules feel free to post them. "	t5_2rvat	True

In my experience, a skier has always been able to capture the best footage. They can do this is because they face down the hill, rather than sideways, and are able to better “absorb” shocks with the core of their body. This causes the overall video to come out smoother.  I've tried filming both ways, and I have found that skiing lent itself to be much easier.  You also have the nice bonus of being able to use one of your ski poles as a mount for your GoPro when filming others. I find that you also have better speed control as a skier, you don't have to rotate your entire body to slow yourself down, but rather you can ""pizza"" brake. Overall, filming while doing either of these will still warrant you great results, however I would prefer to be skiing if I were going to be filming others.

----

With that aside, lets talk about the types of mounts we can use while we film:

1. **Pole Mount** - First and foremost is my favorite mount, The GoPole.  You can create this mount for yourself, [buy a GoPole](http://www.gopole.com/), [or use an old ski pole.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzhFPtH83Mw&amp;feature=related)  The reason I love this mount is because of its versatility, you can use it in a large variety of ways to capture content.

 I highly recommend when you aren't filming yourself with the pole, you invert the camera upside down.  This helps stabilize the footage by using the camera as a counter-weight. Now when you are filming others, try to absorb the rollers on the hill with your legs (this is where being a skier is a huge advantage).  When you use this mount, it is most effective when you are in motion either following the subject, or trailing behind him.  One of the best examples of a follow cam can be seen in several of AbeKislevitz's video's.  He makes use of it several times as a ""follow cam"".  [You can check his videos out here.](http://www.youtube.com/user/abekislevitz).  By watching and analyzing his videos you can get a good idea on how to effectively use the mount to capture certain shots.  An example is putting the camera near the ground (~4 inches off snow) and then panning it up as the rider moves towards the feature.


 In my personal experience, filming upside down has always garnished me the best results, however AbeKislevitz pointed this out:

 &gt;The one thing I would like to add from my own experience is when filming others to actually not turn the camera upside down. I tried this for a while, and while it does act as a nice balancing weight, you get more of a lateral rotation in the camera since you're letting it hang more freely in your hands - this gives footage more noticeable rocking motion in the corners. Cheers!

 So next time I get up to the hill I will have to try this out again, I encourage you to try both and decide for yourself which you prefer.

 I am sure you have seen video's where people use the pole to film themselves.  In my experience, this works best with the camera upright, as it makes it easier to film yourself.  However, please don't create an entire video with this shot, it makes the video long and boring.  However, using it in accompany with other shots that help ""place"" the skier in the viewers mind works well.  Think of it as a ""secondary"" shot, that gives depth to the shot.

 There are lots of creative ways to use this mount, so I encourage you to give it a try, and get creative!

2. **Helmet Mount** - This is one of those shots that can be used very effectively, or it can turn into a boring POV ride down the hill. I find this mount to be most useful when I have a second camera available.  When you use the pole mount to film one angle, use the helmet mount to give a perspective of the rider.  Nobody likes videos composed entirely of this shot, but people love when they get to see the ""riders perspective"" when they complete a certain trick.  Think of a skier doing a rodeo, whenever I see the helmet cam shot, I am tempted to move my head like the skiers.  This really attracts the viewer in, and makes the shot much more interesting!

 There are basically two ways you can go about mounting for this shot, you can use the adhesive mounts, or you can use the head-strap.  People have claimed to get shaky footage when using the head-strap, but I would assume that this is due to the improper tightness of the strap.

 Don't just think the front of the helmet is the best place to mount the camera, I've seen plenty of videos where people get creative and place the camera on the side of the helmet, or they create a ""narwhal"" mount and have a pole extend from the helmet, looking back at them.


3. **Chest Mount** - Lets face it, this mount is best suited for skiers.  With snowboarding you get the awkward ""what's beside me"" shot.  Whereas with skiers, you can see what is actually happening in front of you.  [This video is one of the better uses I have seen of it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=SP7268F0D90ADC9DF8&amp;v=lzSm9dMVtB4#t=33s)

 When you use this mount, don't create an entire video of you riding through powder with this as the only angle.  Rather, use it as a ""pinnacle"" shot where you focus on the rider doing his trick in the air, or as he hits a rail.

 Also make sure that you firmly secure the chesty, when it's loose you tend to get a ""bouncy"" shot.  Firmly securing it should allow you to keep the motion a bit more stable.  Recall that mounting the camera upside down will also help reduce motion.


4. **Boot Mount/Board/Ski Mount** - This is one of the shots where you are going to have to get creative an maybe engage in some DIY. These shots give you nifty perspectives that you wouldn't expect to see.  If you plan on mounting to a ski boot, I recommend using the ""helmet strap"" to secure it to the boot (you may have to use 2 of them).  You can then easily attach the camera to your boot.

 I have also seen a few DIY tutorials for mounting it to your Ski/Board.  I have personally never done this, so I don't have any advice; but I know there are lots of How-To's scattered about the internet on this.

5. **Stationary Mounts** - This all comes down to being creative.  With this, I recommend you use that ""black flat plastic piece"" that came with your camera box.  you can attach your GoPro to it, and use it as a ""base"". Place it all over when you go to film.  I've seen people place it on the middle of jumps, where the skier's skis are splitting the camera.  I've also seen people place them on boxes and have the rider jump over it.  Whatever it is, get creative! It's generally OK if the rider hits it while riding, these cameras are designed to take a beating when they are encased in their housing!


6. **Tripod Mount** - With the [GoPro tripod adapter](http://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Tripod-Mount-HERO-Cameras/dp/B002RCLYXG) you can make a good assortment of mounts. I used some pvc and a 1/4""-20tpi bolt to make a short pole mount for under $10.  This can be used in a variety of different ways, such as a small handheld pole, use on a tripod, or as a ""starter piece"" in a lot of DIY mounts.


7. **Scorpion Mount** - I have never used it before, but I have seen it, really cool mount.  [Here is a DIY tutorial for it](http://goprouser.freeforums.org/stickie-gopro-scorpion-mount-t92.html).  It's basically a view from above the rider looking down. Neat!


8. **Head Swivel Mount** - Did you see in the new Hero3 video where Eric Willet (Snowboarder) has the camera directly in front of him, and continuously swiveling?  Well if you are at all interested, pick up a [swivel mount](http://www.rhinocameragear.com/Rhino%20Products/GoPro%20Camera%20Mounts/Pro-Pole%20Attachments?product_id=90), and 2 [pro poles!](http://www.rhinocameragear.com/Rhino%20Products/GoPro%20Camera%20Mounts/Pro-Pole)

**There are plenty of other ways to mount the camera as well, so get creative!**


-----


I've also created a little list of things I try and focus on when I am filming others:

* Get way closer then you think you need to be! The FOV of the camera is really wide, so being overly close doesn't tend to be a problem.  Make sure you don't crash into the rider though.

* Make the rider the focus of the shot, try to fill the composition with this body, and keep the large masses of snow out of the background.

* Absorb the bumps! Nobody likes shaky footage.

* Try to film when the sun is ""beside"" you instead of ""above you.  This usually tends to be early morning or later in the afternoon.  This helps keep the shadows from becoming too harsh, as well as keeping the snow properly exposed.

* Film everything, review later.  Don't be afraid to keep the camera rolling, you would be surprised how much ""b-roll"" footage you can keep for your videos.


* Buy more batteries! When it gets cold outside, the batteries die faster, so having extras is a must.

I am Matthew with GoPro's UGC department. I have the glorious duties of finding crazy/awesome/cute/epic/moving footage that people like you create! UGC stands for 'User Generated Content'. What we do is we license the raw footage from the person(s) who shot the footage to store in our content library. Our editors would then make an edit with that footage and if all is gravy, it could be a web edit or even a TV commercial. (With compensation!)

This is by no means a sales pitch, but a reminder that myself and other GoPro employees are watching! :)


Here is an example of a web video that an 'average Joe' shot that became a web edit:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXlDStpJVhM

The HD Hero 3 is a huge step ahead of the HD Hero 2. People are going to love these cameras. We will offer three models; the HD Hero 3 White Edition, Silver Edition and Black Edition. We will have three price points, and all three models have WiFi Built into them. They all share a new form factor which is the same rectangular shape (which lends itself to be mounted anywhere, including the Chest), but it's much thinner than the HD1/ HD2. The HD Hero 3 + Backpack is the size of todays camera by itself. All three models will come shipped with the new housing which incorporates an underwater lens into the housing and an improved locking latch. The camera needs to work as well under the water as above the water since it's waterproof. We did have to go to the Micro SD Card format since SD Card Trays are way to big for this camera. There are ton of other improvements; I'll send out a Camera Comparison Sheet once we have that and are allowed to send images.

Camera Line Up:

HD Hero 3 White Edition - $199 Retail. This is basically an HD Hero 1 Camera (5mp photo sensor, etc.) that includes WiFi, dive lens and the new, thinner form factor. Available 10/21/12 to ship. 

1080/30, 960/30, 720/60
5MP Photo
3 shots 1 second photo burst
WiFi Built in
Improved Housing (locking latch / dive lens)

HD Hero 3 Silver Edition - $299 Retail. This is your HD Hero 2 camera with WiFi built in, new form factor and improved housing. Available 10/21/12 to ship.

1080/30, 960/48, 720/60
11MP Photo
10 shots 1 second photo burst
WiFi Built in
Advanced Features / Capture (Protune and White Balance)
Improved Housing (locking latch / dive lens)

HD Hero 3 Black Edition - $399 Retail. This is brand new technology with incredible new settings. Available mid to late November to ship.

4K/15, 2.7K/30, 1440/48, 1080/60, 960/100, 720/120
12MP Photo
30 shots in 1 second (plus many more burst settings where you can control how many shots in the burst and how long the burst lasts)
WiFi Built in
Remote Control Included (only on this model - remote is $79.95 by itself) - if you net out the price of the remote, the Black Edition is only $20 more than the Silver Edition.
Advanced Features / Capture (Protune, White Balance, Continuous Photo, and Picture in Video - PIV capabilities)
Improved Housing (Locking Latch / Dive Lens)

* This is the one camera model that comes in two versions; the Adventure Version and the Surf Version. The surf version simply comes with a surf mount, but no floaty back door.

I have an idea for a film that will only work with the participants of many Redditors (20+) It may or may not have been done before, but I'm not sure if it has been done using entirely GoPros. It would be pretty cool to see what we can create and then submit it to GoPro as a contender for their video of the day.

I want to create a short film, shot in various locations all over the world. A few ideas bouncing around right now are time lapses in all the cities/towns we live in. I'm not talking the big ones that have been done tons of times before, I mean little, unknown towns, with interesting features.  
Another idea (which is similar) is to show the diversity and differences of one thing across all our different towns. For example, the same static 2 second shot of a sunset, in one town, then a shot of a sunset in a town 2000 miles away on a different continent - a sunset is just an idea so you can understand the concept.

Only requirement would be that you have a GoPro (any model that shoots 1080p) and are willing to do a Video Timelapse and upload it somewhere (probably a Dropbox account or something)

If you are interested, comment on here with where your from and wel use this as the basis for the creativity to flow.  If you have any extra ideas towards this, comment and wel all work together to make it happen. 



**EDIT:**


Lots of responses from all over the world, great work everyone. Lets make this happen!!

I agree that it could get boring filming the same thing over and over, so wel open it up a bit to film a timelapse of anything scenery/cityscape/country that you want to in your area (Open to eggtimer timelapse too if people so desire.) The principal behind it all now will be a film created from Redditors worldwide. Lets set a deadline of 1 month from today (May 3rd) this gives people plenty of time to get their footage together (Your more than welcome to do more than one if you are travelling soon!) All shot in 1080p please. I will be putting titles on each clip from the city/town and Country that clip is shot too. I will find the best way for us to all share videos and then re-post later.

FatShadyLives idea is really cool too, if people are willing we can make a separate video with this too, same concept with a twist. It basically involves starting and ending a clip by taking the camera out of a bag (where its black) and ending it by putting it back in the bag (where it returns to black) Make it look like one person has been all over the world. This could be used to film anything, be it removing the camera for a quick shot of London Bridge and then putting it back in the bag, or bringing out the camera for a quick snowboard jump before putting it back in the bag. Again with the locations added to each clip.


**EDIT 2:**


So far we have:

Toronto, Canada. Syndey, Australia. Queensland, Australia. Ecuador. Finland. Oslo, Norway. Tasmania. Hawaii. Aruba. Vinena, Austria. Dublin, Ireland. Germany. London, UK. Thetford, UK. Colchester, UK. Chilterns, UK. Edinburgh, Scotland. Okinawa, Japan. Italy. Milan, Italy. Benidorm, Spain. Oklamona, USA. Minneapolis, USA. Rexburg, USA. Austin, USA. Seattle, USA. Rochester, USA.

**EDIT 3**


I commented this but for those who didnt see it

I have created a new subreddit, r/goprofilm (http://www.reddit.com/r/goprofilm) as a way for us to all share the clips. If you subscribe it also allows you to see any updates and contribute to the ever growing idea.
You can upload clips to your site of choice and then post the link on r/goprofilm. I will go through and download the clips over the next month or so.

Lets try and make everything the same:
*1080p 
*Mp4 only 
*10-15 seconds of timelapsed sped up footage per location (this will be edited down) doesnt matter if eggtimered or not
*Title the clip as city_country_redditusername.mp4 I will add the titles when editing.


A little tip for people, every time you re-encode a video is looses quality, so try to cut the clip down the clip to want, speed it up and then en-code straight to the MP4 you are planning on uploading. Youtube isnt great because it hugely reduces video quality when I download the compressed version. Vimeo is great, just make sure its downloadable :) Mediashare etc are all fine too. If anybody has any suggestions for places to upload please feel free to share."	t5_2rvat	True

1351081062.0	1202rs	Why I'm not buying a Hero 3	Ceret	74	18	40	"I really like my Hero 2. It's been a great little camera, and I think Gopro is doing really interesting things.

There's one big factor that means I won't be buying a Hero 3, however.

I'm writing this in part because I know some of the people at Gopro frequent this forum, and wanted to leave the feedback somewhere where it can be part of a dialogue.

The Hero 3 seems to me to be a great step up, especially in its ability to handle low light. I'd be buying one for sure, except. . . 

The thing is, I'm really very disappointed that the Hero 3 is not more backwards compatible with existing Hero 2 accessories. I have spent more on the accessories in my kit (stuff like housings, filters, bacpacs and so on) than I have the camera itself. I use mine for scuba diving, so need much of this stuff to take a decent video.

If gopro are heading the way of a new model every year (with feature and price creep) and poor legacy support, then I think I will skip this purchase. I really dislike vendors that do this. 

With a product like this, that has a number of relatively expensive optional extras, I prefer a product that has some backwards compatibility with peripherals. 

Let me run through what won't work:

* I have several extra memory cards. No good now.
* I have an extra battery. It won't work.
* I have a LCD bacpac that IS backwards compatible (yay) but it is unclear at the moment how it will work in terms of the new housing. With the current backdoor just slot into the new housing?
* I have a current filter that fits the dive housing for the hero 2. Because the housings are so different, this won't work with the hero 3. It seems to me snake river prototyping has been really burned here too. They have had a lot of customers eagerly awaiting the Dome, which is now an accessory that is only useful to legacy customers, as it won't work on the Hero 3.

And so on. 

Good design, for me, is absolutely about embracing new sensor tech etc - and I would have bought the new camera in a heartbeat if it was *just* the camera I'd need to buy - but it is also about respecting an existing user base with well considered modularity (within reason). You can maximise profit by requiring everything to be upgraded along with the core machine. But a smarter route (imo) is to keep peripheral compatibility. I frequently upgrade my PC box. If I needed to upgrade monitors and keyboards and usb devices each time too, I would pace my purchases very differently.  

Corporate philosophy towards legacy customers is important to me. Brand loyalty is a two-way street. With rumors already circulating about a more expensive, more semi-pro Hero 4 in development - and with competitors likely to appear soon competing for the same market niche the gopro currently occupies - I see lack of good modularity as being a real and significant downside to the gopro range.

Sorry for the rant. The cat isn't interested in hearing it again."	t5_2rvat	True

Hey everybody! I'm a member of the GoPro Image Quality team. We're the guys who are responsible for making sure the image...is quality. (I'm sorry, I had to.) I've been with the company for a few months now, and it's a fantastic place to work. I'm really glad, too, to see this community has sprung up and all the great stuff you guys are posting.

I am *technically* in the engineering department. Buuuuut I'm not an engineer. I was hired because I'm a video guy. I've learned a lot in the past few months, so ask me any questions you may have, and *please* forward me any image related problems you find...but if you ask me the formula to find an ISO I probably won't know it. :)

EDIT: This turned into a mini-AMA and I forgot to verify myself. Herp a derp. Ok, I'm home, I've fed my cat, and I'm sending verification to the mods ASAP...*cracks knuckles* let's do this. 

EDIT: Allrighty, for now I am off to watch Star Trek with my wife. More questions answered tomorrow!

EDIT THE THIRD: Aaaand it's a good morning and I'm back at work. We're talking about possibly doing an official AMA later on, but for now let's keep on cracking in here. Have at thee!

1355303428.0	14pv5b	Hero 3 Black issues I have faced and solved. (May help you out)	icarelessi	51	5	55	"Hello fellow Hero 3 owners.

I just received my Hero Black yesterday, and have run into problems just like many others.

Some of the issues were: Freezing and not powering up, freezing after being plugged into computer, cameras first video only recording a few seconds at the first power on then stopping but going back to normal recording after that, SD err message, Wifi not connecting (remote and phone).

So here are the solutions that worked for me:

1)**Freezing and not powering up**: The Camera would be fine for a bit, and then no longer turn back on. When I tried to power on, the LED on the back would flash slowly. 

**Solution**: This is telling you the battery is low. I noticed the camera takes a long time to charge, especially if plugged into a computer. Make sure the red light is on when plugged in, and the display is off. I know if you power the camera up the display shows a charging image. It is not charging! It is only charging if the red light is solid on the front of the camera and the display is off. Leave it like this until the light turns off. Once the light is off, the camera is fully charged. If you have a wall mount charger (like for an i phone) then plug that into the camera; it charges much faster this way.

2)**Freezing after being plugged into the computer**: After having the camera plugged into my computer it would not turn on. I saw the charging symbol, and left it ""charging"" for about an hour. When I went to use it, it wouldn't respond.

**Solution**: If the display is on, the camera is not charging. Ensure the camera has the solid LED on the front lit up, and the display is off. Once the LED turns off the camera is fully charged. If there is further issue, try removing the SD and battery and trying to charge after replacing the battery alone. Leave it on until the light turns off so you know its fully charged.

3)**Cameras first video only records for a bit, then stops recording**: The camera would take some video after the initial start up, and then stop recording all on its own.

**Solution**: The solution that seems to be working for everyone is saving the files you want to keep and wiping the SD card clean. This issue can be caused by ""ghost"" files on the SD which can bug it up. Make sure to delete ALL files off the SD and let the GoPro re-format the card. Once it's formatted the issue should stop. Repeat if it comes up again.

4)**SD ""err"" (error) message**: The GoPro will display an ""err"" message on the screen. 

**Solution**: This usually is caused by the card being formatted to a separate device. Delete all the files off the device, and I mean ALL! When you use the card in the GoPro it will format it and work fine. There can also be an issue with the card not being compatible with the camera (due to low class, and other issues) if the camera still displays the err after having it formatted, then look into the card being the issue. Also, if the card has been formatted to the GoPro, then it will say ""DCIM"" and ""MISC"" on the card after there was nothing present from the deletion.

5)**Wi-Fi not connecing to the camera (via remote or phone)**: The Remote and/or phone will not connect to the camera.

**Solution**: Make sure the Wifi is turned on in the camera. Go to the settings menu (picture of a wrench) and cycle through until you get to the ""wireless controls"" menu (looks like a sun) Enter the menu until you see ""Wi-Fi RC."" select it then select ""current"" or ""new connection"" once you have done so it should be good to go. Make sure the BLUE light on the camera is flashing to interact with the remote. Connect the camera to the remote, and you're all done.

If your issue is connection to the GoPro app on a phone, then that is due to it not being compatible currently. A release is set for the 14th of December that will allow it to connect. Wait till then and you're good to go. If it isn't connecting still then follow the above directions for the remote, and what the app tells you to do if it doesn't find the camera."	t5_2rvat	True

1376631349.0	1kgzzz	Just got my 3D printed GoPro Hero2 skeleton case. Designed it all from the ground up.	whitenoise106	47	4	35	"Keep checking this post for updates if you are interested because apparently I'm an idiot and don't check things over when I should.  I'm going through and making sure everything is working as it should.

[Here's the album of the case.](http://imgur.com/a/hjgeS#0)  I designed it so I could access the ports and SD card while it was mounted somewhere.  I also added the sunshade to slightly improve the picture quality while protecting the lens from some minor falls.  The wide angle still works with the sunshade on.  It is also compatible with all the bacpac accessories.  Using the GoPro in anything other than 16:9 means the hood will be visible in the picture or video.

Because I designed it to have a bacpac accessory item on it a majority of the time, it works better with the battery cover off.  But it still works well with it on as you can see from the pictures.  

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Edit: ~~If you are interested in getting this, PM me.~~

Edit2: I guess this was a little more popular than I thought it was going to be.  [I'll just put the link to get the case here.](http://shpws.me/oSw2)  Be sure to specify which color material you want.  If having this link in the post is a problem, please let me know asap.  ~~Please wait for just half an hour if you plan on getting this.  I just realized that there is a tiny bit of the sunshade when filming on wide.  I'll strike this out when complete.~~ Fixed =]

[Someone was wondering about the durability of the case so here's a quick test I did to show how flexible it is.  It can still go further.](http://imgur.com/lK0bih9)

Edit3:  [I added a case for those of you who would like to use GoPros as a stand alone camera.](http://shpws.me/oSHm) 

Edit4:  Sorry guys, I made a mistake and the wide 1080 mode will not work without showing some of the hood.

EDIT5:  Keep editing this post.... I have updated/uploaded the design again so now it SHOULD work fine with 1080p-wide.  I measured the material needed to take off of the original hood so it will not show in 16:9.  As for 4:3, that will still show some of the hood.  Fortunately, you can crop the photo into 16:9 if you are using it in a video.  Video comparison of MY printed case should be up shortly.  The video does not reflect the new changes to the case that are already uploaded into the design and ready for printing if you choose to get it.

Edit6:  [Here's the test video for my case.  Again, the case that is currently available has addressed the wide angle issue.  4:3 is still a problem, though.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TW7FrQXKEk&amp;feature=youtu.be)"	t5_2rvat	True

I had the issue where it'd record flawlessly while sitting still but as soon as I mounted it and rode my downhill bike with it, it would stop recording after about 30 seconds. I emailed customer support and within 15 minutes got a response back telling me what to try to do to fix the error. It worked! I was stoked and was happy to have my camera working again. A week later, the camera started acting up again. I emailed the same customer service representative and received another speedy response telling me to send images and proof of purchase. After doing that I unfortunately had to send my camera back to GoPro. I called before sending and talked to the nicest guy named Daniel who took my case into his own hands. I paid the lovely $2 charge to ship the camera back and sent the tracking number via email to Daniel. He told me a new camera would be on it's way back to me before they even had received mine. I got the camera a few days later and they even sent it FedEx and got it to me in a hurry. The customer support at GoPro was much much better than I could have ever expected. Just wanna give a huge shout out to them! Keep up the great work. You'll definitely have my business over any other action camera company. 	t5_2rvat	True

Once I bought my gopro, I realized even the most simple accessories were stupidly overpriced.  Some things you could find made by a third party such as a tripod adapter but not many other things.

Other things such as the Chesty were too expensive in my opinion at $40 but there were no alternatives.  Living on a fellowship (working scholarship) I have a limited budget so i could only buy so much.

I have recently been able to come across some supplier of several accessories. I am about to embark on a motorcycle trip through Vietnam/Cambodia and will be taking the samples with me to see how they hold up.

If they hold up well, I will make a large order and start selling them online for cheaper than the gopro branded items.

So, how many of you would be interested in cheaper but great quality accessories?  I know I would personally use a lot more attachments and put them on a bunch of stuff if they weren't so expensive

However, due to the curved glass of the standard housing, the gopro cannot focus underwater.  All my videos and photos underwater are terrible, even in good light close to the surface.

Watched some videos of the same camera with the dive housing, and that is how I imagined my videos would look.

Just thought I would mention this in case anyone was thinking of doing something similar."	t5_2rvat	True

Either way, I'm going to start doing some GoPro Q&amp;A / Tutorials where users can ask pretty much any questions they want and I'll either do an editing tutorial or just answer the question in a video (as long as i know the answer to your question). 
Hopefully this is something you all are interested in, if not I'll delete this post based on the downvotes ;)

As some of you may have already noticed, I pull a lot of the great content from this subreddit for our social networks. Keep it coming! It doesn't have to be action sports oriented. For instance, I posted up the clocktown timelapse on our Twitter and it got a *great* response. Get creative.

Here is my one request.. Please, please.. *please* stop using AWOLNATION - Sail as the song to your video. Or M83 - Midnight City for that matter. I have to hear that Sail song about 3 times a day.

I usually monitor this subreddit pretty closely, although I did miss a lot from being down at XGames for the past 5 days, so if you think you have something really interesting or compelling you want me to check you shoot me a message (link is in the sidebar). If you just post something up for everyone to see, include your first name or even better your twitter handle in the video so I can give you the proper credit. 

Most of the stuff I find here goes on Twitter, as we save our Facebook for our media team edits or extremely well done content.

Thanks for being such an awesome community!

NeverNude123	40	6	45	Unfortunately I can't say the source of this information but I can share with you what I know is 100% accurate. The GoPro 3 will be arriving at most stores before the end of October. There will be 3 separate models. The GoPro 3 White coming in at 199.99, the GoPro 3 Silver at 299.99, and the GoPro 3 black toping out at 399.99. My main guess as to the difference in these models would be an actual filming and image quality improvement between the white and silver editions and only an attachment difference between the silver and black. Even though they should be hitting the stores by the end of October I have yet to find a sell date. Hope that helps some of you out!	t5_2rvat	True

I was in at the local Best Buy picking up some things for work, and I decided to swing by the GoPro end cap to get a first-hand look at the new HERO3.

When I got to the end cap, I found a very confused customer and a stammering employee who was hopelessly trying to explain to the former the features and differences of the new HERO3 cameras.

I couldn't keep my mouth shut, and I answered one of the customer's questions before the employee had a chance to read it off of the box.  The employee then asked me if I was planning on buying one, and I informed him that I had multiples of the previous generations, and that I planned on getting the HERO3 before my next big trip.

The customer, recognizing that I was much more informed about the camera than the employee, started asking me all sorts of questions about features, difficulties, pricing, etc.  The employee ended up walking away while we were talking.

15 minutes later, I wished the new GoPro (Black edition!) owner good luck with his new camera and left the store.


**TL;DR**- Word of mouth is a million times more effective than poorly trained chain store employees.

Anyone ever have a similar experience?


EDIT:  My goal wasn't to put down Best Buy or big box retailers.  I meant to highlight how effective GoPro ""Superfans"" are at selling the product via word of mouth."	t5_2rvat	True

I was wondering what the possibility was of having an AMA with someone from your video production department, here on /r/GOPRO? I think many of us love the videos you all churn out on your official Youtube account. 

With many questions regarding editing, post-production work, formatting, compressing, etc being posted on here, I think it would be extremely helpful if you were able to organize an AMA with someone who works in that department!

I normally wouldn't make such a request of a company, but with how active GoPro seems to be within the various communities on the Internet, I cant help but hope such a thing might be possible. One of the reasons GoPro's product is so successful is because of the many amazing videos its customers create. If we can get an AMA where many of our post-production questions can be answered, the quality of user-created videos will only surely grow, adding even more exposure to the wonderful world of GoPro!"	t5_2rvat	True

Reddit user GoPro_HERO says, ""The apps will be out shortly,"" and, ""I can assure you that the app is coming VERY close behind the Wi-Fi release date. No more than a month, maybe even sooner.""

Reddit user GoPro_HERO says, ""It's coming very soon guys. Hang tight!"" and ""but now that it's out it won't be long at all for the app""


**July 2nd 2012**
[http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/vxt0q/a_friendly_request_from_your_gopro_community/](http://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/vxt0q/a_friendly_request_from_your_gopro_community/)

Reddit user GoPro_HERO says, ""PS- Before anyone asks, the Wi-Fi app will be out very soon. Hang tight!""


This is basically where I decided to stop.  As of writing this, the most recent posting in my above list was 79 days ago, yesterday (July 18th) reddit user GoPro_HERO says, ""Very, very soon. Very.""  This is way past getting old.

I understand that reddit user GoPro_HERO isn't the guy that decides when it get's released, I also understand that he/she probably has people telling him more or less what to post and when.  Fact is, I bought a product MONTHS ago because of the android functionality, I've endured MONTHS of postings, videos and tweets about how this app is coming any day now and I still don't have it.

So, what's the real deal GoPro, don't you feel a little slimy every time a new date or time frame is given and then passed?  Don't you feel the least bit guilty jerking around your core user group?  Aren't you worried that this kind of behavior will end up spreading the word around that GoPro can't fulfill it's promises?"	t5_2rvat	True

I believe I have found the easiest, and possibly quickest, way there is.

You will need:
 
- A GoPro Camera that shoots 60+ frames per second

- [GoPro Cineform Studio](http://gopro.com/3d-cineform-studio-software-download/)

**Step 1**

- Open up Cineform and click the blue button labeled **import new files** and find your video file
- (You can also simply drop the file in the box on the left)

**Step 2**

- Click and see your video in the [viewer](http://imgur.com/XeWobwZ) (here you can set the in and out points, rotate/flip the video, and change where you save the video to)
- Notice my video was shot on 60.73 frames per a second. You must shoot in 60 fps or higher if you would like your slow motion to be smooth.
- Here, I will slow the video down to half speed, or 30 frames per a second. This will make the video twice as long, but will look smooth while in slow motion.

**Step 3**

- Click **Advanced Settings** 
- You will see a [small box](http://imgur.com/523NZ1R) fall down with a few settings.

**Step 4**

- Image Size: Source Video (whatever resolution you shot at)
- Frame rate: Depending on your original frames per second, choose between 23.98p to 29.97p. The goal is to cut the source fps in half a close as possible. **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!**
- Quality: I personally like it to be on HIGH, but choose whichever you prefer.
- Remember setttings for future clips: If you have multiple clips, click the small box. (Haha, GoPro Cineform has a spelling error.)
- [This is how I like my settings.](http://imgur.com/nutaQ56)
- Click OK

**Step 5**

- You can change your video's file name to whatever you like, then adjust where the video is saved to.
- Click **Add Clip to Conversion List** [like so](http://imgur.com/M7QTcE2)
- Now you can either convert the video, or you can edit other videos in your box on the left panel.
- Click **Convert**, wait tip the video is done converting, and BAM! Slow Motion.

Now your converted video is [twice as long](http://imgur.com/2VW0a44), but is played back at half speed with a smooth slow motion. To get the video back to regular speed in an editor, just speed it up 200%. 

If you guys would like to see the product of the slow motion, I edited a rowing video for my high school team. I think you'll be able to tell which parts are the smooth slow motion. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SGvpytYlM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SGvpytYlM)"	t5_2rvat	True

Like many of you, my GoPro sits on my desk collecting dust 360 days of the year, and I know everyone is always looking for fun things to shoot and edit, so I've come up with an idea... I also am a complete novice with editing, and the only way to improve is to get your hands dirty and do it. Brace yourself, because this idea might suck.


How about once a month (or quarter even?) we decide on a topic or theme, and everyone has to make a video to suit that idea or topic. Some suggestions would be:

* Underwater themed video
* Film, edit and publish in its entirety in less than 24 hours *(and here is [my attempt at this](http://youtu.be/pwEgNAr680U))*
* Something filmed entirely in the first person *(head mount)*
* ?????

What do you think? Would anyone else be into this? I guess for a 'prize', you could have your video in the sidebar for a month or until the next challenge..

Obligatory shameless plug for my [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/mickdelux).

Aaron here, your GoPro community manager. Sorry I haven't been around as much lately but I'm role is changing a bit and I'm focusing more on other aspects of the community manager role. I'll still lurk, comment, and post when I can but to hold you guys over I'd like to intro everyone to Matthew. 

Matthew works in our media department and he'll be scouring, combing, and turning the web upside down to find content. I told him /r/GoPro is one of the best places to source awesome content so you should expect him to be around lurking and commenting quite a bit. The difference between Matthew and myself is that I look for cool content to post onto our social platforms, whereas Matthew will be looking for content that the GoPro media team may be interested in acquiring (possible money!) for various purposes. That could be commercials, YouTube moments, or a variety of things that I'll let him expand on. 

Here is a good example of content we acquired and created our own edit + a commercial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zfsRsPUQkM

So about 2-3 weeks ago there was talk about external USB batteries, and there was a slim/high capacity/sleek design one that want funding on Kickstarter or already had been made and cost over $100 for 8000 mAh. I was curious of a cheap Chinese solution and wanted to see if there was something comparable.

Low and behold I purchased [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/221190580753) for about $22, and now that I've had a little time to do the tests I figure I would post what you can expect out of this thing. All tests done without WiFi/protune on, with a H3B. 
Here are some pictures [link](http://imgur.com/a/lXomO) to give you an idea on size and weight. 

* The Video test:

So first lets see how much life this has recording video. Full batteries (interal GoPro stock battery and the chinese external), I hit record and come back the next day to see when it has stopped. Turns out, on a 64 GB sd card you can record 4.5 hours of 1080p before it fills up. 1 LED dimmed (more on this later). So apparently, this is more then enough for anyone to get through a day with a single MicroSD card. In all honest I should have recorded it on loop mode and noted the start time. If people are interested enough in this, I can do it, but I figured most people would be interested in just knowing if they could record until the SD card filled up.

* The Timelapse Test:

Longest settings possible, I did 12 MP picture every 60 seconds. This lasted 15 Hours. There was no point in uploading the video for the first test, but for this test the video is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvoMzdA-PMw). You can see that it has a non linear LED percentage drop, so if the LEDs start turning off you are running near the end of the batteries charge.


Future: My next test will likely just be to see how long can I get through a week without a wall charger and simply using this to charge my iPhone 4. 


 **TL;DR/Summary**

It works awesome for $22. Will fill a 64 GB with video before it dies (at 1080 60FPS) or last 15 hours with a 60 second timpelapse interval. Just simply useful to have in your backpack for charging your phone or tablet as well, highly recommend it for people who fly on trips that last more than 2 hours.

Still skeptical if it is truely 20000 mAh (should open it up, I imagine the battery is actually rated at that), but I paid $10-15 for one on newegg with 2000 mAh that only charged iPhones (and 30 minutes at that) and now I feel ripped off on that purchase. 


EDIT:

It took me about 14 hour or more to charge it with an OEM iPhone 4 1A charger. "	t5_2rvat	True

** Can't Decide which model to pick? Take a look at this table. **

**What SD Card should I buy?**

GoPro recommends SanDisk or Kingston cards for all their cameras. For the Hero2, Hero3, and future models, we recommend you purchase a class 10 memory card.

The Hero2, Hero1, and Hero 960 all use regular SD cards.
The Hero 3 uses a MicroSD card.

**How do I update my firmware?**

There are two ways, you can use GoPro's [Java-based Updater](http://gopro.com/support/product-updates-support/), or through the device manager in their free [Cineform Studio Software](http://gopro.com/software-app/cineform-studio/).

**How do I make a time lapse?**

The simplest way is using GoPro's free Cineform Studio Software. Once you've downloaded that, simply import the first picture in the full, sequential list of timelapse photos and cineform will import it as a video. Use the advanced settings to fine-tune the timelapse before you convert then edit it.

**Are the hero2 bacpacs compatible with the hero3? Mounts?**

Yes on all accounts. All except the Wifi BacPac since Wifi is built into all Hero3s.

**Which Model should I buy?** 

For info-graphic lovers [click here](http://i.imgur.com/7fmTM.jpg)

Here are my thoughts on an answer:
There are currently 4 generations of GoPro out on the market in one form or another.

**Hero960** – This is a mostly obsolete generation, but you can still find a few for sale. Released in the same year as it's ""big brother"", the HD Hero, the Hero960 featured most of the specs as the HD Hero but at a fraction of the cost and missing a few features. Among them, the Hero960 was shorted a few shooting modes (no high frame rates or full 1080p HD), and was created without the ability to use the BackPac accessories. It was much cheaper at the time, but there is not a lot of value in getting one today when there are significantly more advanced models available for a similar price.

**HD Hero** – This is the second generation of GoPro cameras, and the first to feature full HD (1080p resolution).

**HD Hero2** – This is the third generation of GoPro’s line, and featured a number of improvements over the original Hero, including a better sensor, more resolution options, faster frame rates, and a significantly improved user interface.

**HD Hero3** – The fourth and current generation of GoPro is segmented it three variants: The White, Silver, and Black edition models. While all feature and entirely new form factor (smaller, lighter, etc) than the previous generations, the White and Silver edition cameras mimic the features of the HD Hero and Hero2, respectively. The Hero3 Black Edition differentiates itself as the flagship model, sporting unprecedented shooting resolutions, frame rates, and control.

So where do YOU fit into the GoPro family? Well, GoPro has actually provided an insight into their goals into the market that can actually help you out in deciding. They segment their target market into three different units: The General Consumer, the “Prosumer”, and the Professional.
A general consumer is someone who watches the ads, thinks GoPro footage is awesome, and gets stoked about buying one… but doesn’t really know anything about photo/videography or post processing. They really just want to shoot footage with their camera and upload it to YouTube, using free tools available to them for editing.

The “Prosumer” is a mix of the general consumer and the professional market. They’re not completely uneducated about cameras, and are interested in experimenting with advanced use of their cameras… Timelapse, slow motion, etc. Often Prosumers will self-educate to raise themselves closer towards the Professional level.
The Professional user is exactly like what it sounds like. Well-versed in photo and videography, familiar with advanced post-process functions like editing RAW and Color correction, etc. These users want every feature possible from the camera, as they want to have every capability to use their camera the way they want to.

Chances are, if you’re reading this FAQ, you’re either a general consumer or a budding prosumer. Luckily for you GoPro makes a camera for each of these three segments, and knowing what you are can help identify which GoPro might be best suited for you.

* General consumer– If you’re just looking to try this out for the first time, the Hero 3 White edition or the original HD Hero might be perfect for you. The original HD Hero was and still is a fantastic camera, and shares most of its specs with the Hero3 White edition… but with a lower price. The Hero3 White Edition, while a bit pricier, features the improved UI, the smaller design, and built in Wifi capability. Original Hero accessories will be cheaper, but not as readily available. Hero3 White edition will have more expensive accessories, but you will be able to stay current with any new accessories GoPro releases. If you’re planning on getting more serious with this, try the Hero3 White! If you’re just looking to goof off a little, try an original HD Hero to help you decide if this is for you.

* Prosumer – Chances are, if you’re reading this FAQ you’re either a general consumer, or just barely edging into the prosumer level. If you think you’re in the latter group, you’re probably interested in some of the deeper capabilities of the GoPro, and want to explore doing things where faster shooting modes and more advanced features are available. If that sounds like you, a HD Hero2 or Hero3 Silver edition might be perfect for you. Like the HD Hero and Hero3 White Edition relate to each other, the Hero2 and Hero3 Silver Edition share most of the same specs with each other… the Hero3 Silver edition again features the new size, built in wifi, etc. Similarly, the Hero3 Silver is easy to buy accessories for, but for a higher price, and the Hero2 will have cheaper, but outdated accessories. The Hero2 is the cheaper investment, if you think you’re on the bottom edge of the prosumer level. If you think you’re in the middle of the prosumer level or higher, you probably want the Hero3 Silver Edition.

* Professional – If you’re on the professional level… or are on the upper level of Prosumer and maybe would LIKE to be there (Say, you already have a GoPro of a previous generation, and don’t know which of the newest generation you should get), the Hero3 Black Edition is the only camera for you. The Black Edition features all of the new perks of size, sharper lens, improved sensor, built in wifi, etc… but it also features unprecedented shooting modes like720p at 120fps, 4k at 15fps, and 30img/sec burst mode. The Black Edition will give you the most to work with, but that also often requires a little more work in post process to get what you want out of it. If you’re looking for room to grow as a GoPro user, the Black Edition will give you a VERY high ceiling."	t5_2rvat	True

1350594579.0	11plhx	Some technical information about GoPro's wifi for the geeks out there	klinquist	28	6	24	"This is true for the Hero2 &amp; wifi bacpac, I suspect it will be identical for the Hero3 with built-in wifi.

There are two wifi modes that you select on the camera:  ""Wifi remote control""  or  ""Phone and tablet"" mode.

When in Wifi remote control mode, the remote control is the wifi ""host"" and the camera (or multiple cameras) connect to it (I have not yet discovered the hidden SSID).  The remote control has an LCD identical to the one in the front of the GoPro - it mirrors it.  The two buttons on the remote also mirror the power &amp; shutter buttons on the GoPro.

When in Phone &amp; Tablet mode, the GoPro is the wifi ""host"" - it creates a wifi network.  You specify the name &amp; WPA2 key when you plug it in via USB to your computer and launch CineForm studio.

The wifi bacpac runs its own DHCP server.  It gives itself the IP address 10.5.5.9 and gives clients the IPs 10.5.5.109, 108, 107, etc.  The iPhone app automatically tries connecting to 10.5.5.9 upon launch - no way to specify an alternate address.

The wifi bacpac has ports 80 &amp; 8080 open.   You can browse to port 8080 in your web browser and see a ""cherokee"" web server landing page along with folders for videos, live, and shutter.  Your memory card's contents are in the videos folder - it may be handy to pull videos off wirelessly.  ""Live"" contains short recent clips and with VLC you can see a slightly delayed view.  The shutter folder seems to be empty.

I did some packet capturing with WireShark and found the iPhone app sends commands to the bacpac on port 80.  It issues HTTP GET commands such as:  


GET /bacpac/se?t=[yourWPAkey]  HTTP/1.1  


GET /camera/PV&amp;t=[yourWEPkey]&amp;p=%02 HTTP/1.1     (this seems to be for the live preview)  


Replies seem to get sent to port 60187 on the iPhone.  I have not yet been able to remotely control the GoPro from the command line of my computer, but I suspect I'm not far from figuring it out.  If someone else is interested, I can post up the .pcap.

I was able to make the GoPro accessible from my home network (rather from the GoPro's own wifi network) with a wireless bridge and a static route.   With a VPN it'd be pretty easy to make your GoPro accessible from anywhere.


Just about the cheapest router or wireless bridge you can buy these days is a Raspberry Pi ($35) with a USB NIC or two ($10ea).     You could also use this to perform lots of automated things with the GoPro - I'd love to hear others' ideas. 

Hope this helps people out!

Found this buried on Vimeo. It's a simple way of adapting your gopro Hero/Hero 2 so that the you don't get that choppy, CMOS effect from the prop while in flight. I've done something similar but I bought a Snake River Prototyping Blur Fix ring and use a .9 ND filter. Using this DIY method, you can get the same results for less.

I have a trip to Iceland this Christmas and a trip to snowboard in Tahoe next year so I figured this would be perfect.

Basically, I'm wondering if you guys have any advice for me on avoiding pitfalls or the ""right"" way to record or edit footage. I'm only slightly familiar with editing software but I have access to Adobe products and Final Cut X. Also, if you know of any ""must-have"" accessories, let me know! For the trip to Iceland, it will mainly be hiking around with some vehicle transport. For Tahoe, however, maybe a chest mount and a suction cup mount for my snowboard?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I'll be posting some natureporn whenever I get back from Iceland ;) I'm hoping to make an eggtimer time-lapse mount for any auroras I see..."	t5_2rvat	True

Just Thought I would post up a comparison i have done between The Original GoPro Battery I got with the camera and some Generic Batteries i got off ebay.

**Link : AUD, http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/300856478392?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649**




I picked 3 batteries and a charger up for 27AUD, Only problem is the power adapter supplied with the wall charger cant support the weight of the unit so it falls of. Luckily i had a few spare adapters so i used one of those. They took about 3 weeks to get to Australia which is about normal for things being shipped out of China. The batteries say they are 1599mAh (copared to the 1050mAh on the original) however if you believe that i have a bridge i can sell you!

I have used each of the batteries atleast twice to make sure they charge,discharge and charge again. I did not notice any difference in battery life between them all so i decided to do a comparison. 

I used the test generic battery  as my main battery for about a week, dischargning/charging it 5/6 times then plugged in my LCD touch backpack to see how long it will last. 



**Test : Gopro3Black set to 1080/30fps, with LCD backpack, Wireless Off.**

* Generic Battery 1 : 1hr 11 minutes 5 seconds
* GoPro Battery : 1hr 9minutes: 6 seconds. 



The gopro battery is 2 months old and probably has been charged around 20 times. 

It hasnt been looked after to nicely as its my only battery so i try and make sure its fully charged everytime i go out to use it.




**Obviously buying Cheap Chinese Batteries comes with its own risks:**

The Batteries are working well at the moment, However they are only a week old and might stop working. 
Cheap Li-ion batteries do have a tendency to swell whilst being charged. For this reason i would recommend only charging them in the wall charger. If they swell in your gopro you might struggle to get it out. 


I have had quite good luck with Chinese batteries. however i understand it is hit and miss.

I would definitely buy again. if 1 stops working in 6 months i will go and buy 3 more.

 I understand you do get what you pay for so I'm not expecting much from these batteries however for the moment they are great!

If anyone wants to run a similar test with a Wasabi go for it! if anyone else has had good/bad experiences with these batteries please post."	t5_2rvat	True

The reason for using the wiki and not the default FAQ setup is that we can all edit it at some point. I can approve certain people to edit and maintain this wiki and it will be a lot easier to maintain than going on the honor system. 

I'm hoping to launch it this weekend. So far it will contain all the information captured in the current FAQ linked in the side bar plus some other things. 

I get my Hero 3 Black tomorrow and hope to crank out a bunch of videos on how to use your GoPro. Noob stuff for the most part but editing, sound, effects, slowmo, will all come next. 

Work is being done behind the scenes and I'm hoping we can really turn this wiki into a real learning tool. It's going to take the effort of a few of us and not just me so if you have suggestions for guides that aren't already in the current FAQ leave a comment below. "	t5_2rvat	True
