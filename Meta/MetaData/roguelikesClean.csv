I know you want to turn ADOM into something that makes you money on the iPhone, and that's cool.  I'd support you in that if I didn't vastly prefer Android, which I do.  I think I also remember that you wanted to make JADE some kind of subscription service, which, you know, whatever.  I've read your blog for years, hoping you'd do something with ADOM, but you never did.  After all this time, can we finally agree that not releasing the source code for ADOM was a very, very lame move?

You want to know what would get you my money?  Releasing the source code and heading a big expansion and development project akin to DCSS.  Everybody loves DCSS and it gets worked on, added to, tweaked, and improved on an almost daily basis.  However, everyone also likes ADOM, but you haven't done a damn thing with it for like NINE YEARS.  Sure it was your game, and you worked on it for years, and we all appreciate you for that.  Problem is that you then squatted on it and did nothing but have ideas and make promises that you never kept.  

I'd love to be playing ADOM 7.0.0 right now instead of Crawl.  ADOM started as a better game than Crawl to begin with, but in the last 9 years, ADOM has been left behind.  DCSS is outstanding.  Every new version is better than the last, and even though DCSS has been happening for 6 years now, there's no reason to think that it won't keep improving for another 6.  That could have been your game.  It could be your game that hundreds of people play online every day.

It could also have been your ""Donate Here"" button on the main website.

If you want my money, open up the source and encourage ongoing development by the community (and hopefully take the reins yourself and drive the project forward).  I'm not buying iADOM, assuming it's ever released, because I don't have or want an iPhone.  I'm not sure I'd buy ADOM on the android either, because I don't really want to spend hundreds of hours gaming on my DAMN PHONE.

I've played ADOM plenty over the years, and I'd love to give you some of my money as a show of gratitude.  You'll get it as soon as it looks like you are willing to do something I want to encourage.

With Love,

Some Random Guy From The Internet"	t5_2rhpi	True

So I'm going to try and contribute to the community instead, hopefully that will cover for the plug :)

Today I'm going talk about one technical aspect of my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com), that is random procedural dungeon generation. It's pretty over-engineered, but hopefully will give anyone interested some ideas on generating dungeon layouts for their own games.

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it, step by step:

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate, say 150. This is an arbitrary amount really, but the higher the number the larger the dungeon and in general more complexity.

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much, but it should probably be proportionate to the number of cells. 

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages), I'm using [Park-Miller Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). This skews the size of the cells so that they are more likely to be of a small size (more smaller cells, less larger cells). The reason for this will be explained later!

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large, we don't want perfectly square rooms but neither do we want really skinny ones, but somewhere in between.

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area, most are overlapping. Next we use simple separation steering behaviour to separate out all of the rectangles so that none are overlapping. This technique ensures that the cells are not overlapping, yet in general remain as tightly packed together as possible.

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells, all perfectly packed together.

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier, there will only be a small amount of rooms in comparison to the number of cells, with lots of space between. The remaining cells are still useful however... read on.

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout), we then construct a [Minimal Spanning Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) using the previous graph. This creates a graph that guarantees all rooms are connected (and therefore reachable in the game).

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, but again is a boring dungeon layout because it contains no loops, it is the other extreme to the Delaunay Triangulation. So now we re-incorporate a small number of edges from the triangulated graph (say 15% of the remaining edges after the minimal spanning tree has been created). The final layout will therefore be a graph of all rooms, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, for each edge we construct a series of straight lines (or L shapes) going from each room of the graph to its neighbour. This is where the cells we have not yet used (those cells in the grid which are not rooms) become useful. Any cells which intersect with the L shapes become corridor tiles. Because of the variety in cell sizes, the walls of the corridors will be twisty and uneven, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

Not long after, my computer died and I lost a lot of assets and pretty much gave up on the project.

It took me ages to rebuild the engine. To the point where I was thinking, ""why am I even trying so hard to make this free game?""

But I succeeded in rebuilding massive chunks of the engine from scratch. And after sharing it on yayhooray.com, the positive feedback made me feel like throwing it in for the IGF awards. I felt like an idiot for being so bold afterwards.

Today I recieved two glowing reviews from [indiegames.com](http://indiegames.com/2011/10/demo_red_rogue_aaron_steed.html) and [rock paper shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/10/28/crimson-blaggard-red-rogue/) today. For a game I haven't even finished yet.

So if you're working on a roguelike, and you feel like it's too much, that you don't have the time to make an RPG, that you should make something simpler...

Never give up.

Never surrender.

It doesn't matter if I get in for some award (it would be nice though). What matters is that I made that fucking RPG. And I posted the fucking [source](https://github.com/st33d/red-rogue) up, and hopefully, some other guy will say, ""Fuck it! We DO need one more roguelike!

----------------------
  
I've played many a roguelike, but FTL / Dredmore really grabbed me with their polished graphics, sound and overall style (heresey, I know).

Where should I go next for a serving of pretty-looking brutality?

**Edit : Just to make it clear to the Knights of ASCII out there, to me, pretty/polished does not mean face melting graphics, it just means a clear sense of style that sets it apart from others like it.  I don't care if it's animated or not, I just appreciate it when there's thought put into it.**

For example, maybe you can pass an item or two down to your next character, or you have a house that you can store things in. Or maybe your knowledge of monsters stays with you. There are lots of possibilities; I'm just thinking of anything that makes the time spent on a character not completely gone after you die.

I know Tome4 has the paid ""item bank"" and I believe some Angband variant or another kept monster knowledge across your various characters, but any suggestions are cool.

People are going to suggest Rogue Legacy, but I don't find that game much fun and it's not really a roguelike, plus its designed around dying countless times in order to progress in the game, which isn't really much fun and not the type of game I'm looking for. Path of Exile isn't really a roguelike, but it features a stash that can be shared so that you can pass down items to your future characters after you die, which is pretty cool.

1369864906.0	1faosp	Adapting Minecraft to a Roguelike	abrightmoore	66	17	14	"I am tinkering with generating dungeon complexes within the 3D Minecraft environment. I have a script that walks the map placing rooms from a library that the map maker or player can contribute to. Here is what I've done so far:

http://www.brightmoore.net/mcedit-filters-1/dungeonschematicrandomizerv2

I have been bitten by the idea of redstone rooms and dark tunnels spanning a large underground area, where the player fights their way through the dark with nothing but flint and steel to light the way through the domain of zombies, spiders, skeletons and creepers - solving redstone riddles and chasing after forgotten caches of treasure and equipment in ancient tombs.

I've added some notes on how it works to the blog, and glossed over some of the PYMCLEVEL API challenges and solutions, but if this is relevant to you let me know and I'll expand on how it works under the covers.

The current script features:

1. It won't place rooms above the starting location

2. It suppresses rooms from colliding and overwriting each other

3. It correctly hooks up each room based on the centre of each connected face.


Eventually I want to seed chests around the place, with loot. At the moment this has to be pre-configured in the room templates placed in the library directory.

In the sample tile sets are maze sections, arched rooms, sewers and some scenic areas. I'll do a clean up at some point and build in traps and puzzles.

For now though, I welcome feedback. I'm at that point where a lot of the 'how do I do this' is solved, and now I'm into incremental improvements and building some decent content.

tl;dr: Minecraft as a platform for a rogue-like dungeon hack

Features:
 
* Delve deep into procedurally-generated dungeons, brutally defeating swarms of enemies
* Challenging combat means you are always close to death, but skillful timing of attacks, dodges, blocks, counters, and other abilities will ensure your continued survival
* Permanent death: Choose wisely, you only have one life to live!
* Wield one of many swords, each with their own special abilities
* Gamepad-enabled! Play locally with up to four friends
* A brütäl heavy metal soundtrack by Pip Malt

It's taken me about 10 months, 8 of them actually working on the game in my spare time. I desperately hope I was successful in making a challenging, fair, and varied combat system that makes for an exciting and unique brawler.

SWOOOORDS! is basically the combat prototype for a much larger action RPG I'm calling Urverden. It will be an attempt at combining the brawler and roguelike genres to provide a unique experience, somewhere in between Dark Souls and Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode."	t5_2rhpi	True

1312489787.0	j963v	[DCSS] Species Review 1: Heaven, Hell and Earth	ionfrigate	54	5	11	"So after finally finishing greatplayers, that is, beating the game with every species (in addition to splatting this week's weekly in Zot), I figured I would post my reviews of each species.  

The format is as follows: difficulty is rated as early game/late game, each on a scale from # (super easy) to ##### (absurdly hard).  Then the even more subjective fun score is rated on a scale from # (boring and annoying to play) to ### (enjoyable but doesn't add much) to ##### (the best).  I also note what class(es) I won the game with, as well as any other classes I got pretty far with.  A * in front of a class denotes a winning game.

So without further ado, let's start with three variants on normal humans, from here, above and below: Humans, Demigods, and Demonspawn.

**Human:**

* Classes: *Ar, Cr

* Difficulty: ## / ##

* The average race, humans are fairly easy to play.  Their unspecialized aptitudes do mean it's difficult to gain any particularly strong skills early on, but a +0 aptitude will generally get you far enough.  Their major advantage, however, comes from their quick levelling.  You can level as quickly as a kobold, but still have good HP.  You can level as quickly as a hill orc, but still be able to branch out into magic.  They are by far the most versatile of the fast-levelling races.

* Fun: ###

* It's the average race.  Hence the average fun score.  I don't think they're horribly boring, as some others seem to.  The same lack of specialization that some might call boring design is the same thing which allows them to pick up any skill in the game.  In the end, it balances out.

**Demigod:**

* Classes: *Cj, Wz

* Difficulty: #### / #

* Demigods are difficult to start, but mostly not for the reason one might think.  It is not their lack of a god that is difficult.  Think about it: how much does your god usually help you early game, or even early mid-game?  Unless you're a Trog worshiper, not much.  No, demigods are difficult to start because of their aptitudes.  They took a major hit with the aptitude reconfiguring in 0.7: their aptitudes went from 110 to 119 on the old scale.  Combined with their slow levelling, this leads to a somewhat difficult early game.  However, their superb HP, MP and stats will before long make them shine, especially once you start getting enough XP to get past their mediocre aptitudes.  End-game, they make excellent hybrids, and moreover because of their superb stats, they'll almost invariably have the stats for it, no matter how you distribute the level-up increases.

* Fun: ###

* I do admit that the lack of a god takes one dimension out of the game.  However, it is quite fun to play a character with such beautiful stats and HP/MP, so I say it balances out in the end.

**Demonspawn:**

* Classes: *Be

* Difficulty: # to #### / ###

* Demonspawn are not particularly easy.  They do have the advantage over demigods in that they have a few good aptitudes.  They also have worse health, however, and level just as slowly.  What makes a demonspawn game either easy or hard is the mutations.  If you get demonic guardian 2 at XL8 or so, you have an absurdly easy time.  Conversly, if you're stuck with horns 1, colorless scales and one level of negative energy resistance at XL11, you're going to have a fairly difficult time.  It's just variable.  Later on, their demonic mutations are fairly helpful but no longer have the possibility of being game-breaking.  And they lack any other major advantages in the end-game.

* Fun: ####

* I have to admit, I do enjoy a random character.  Despite the frequent uselessness and lateness of their mutations, it is thrilling to try to gain that next level, just to see what mutation you get.  I do wish they gained mutations just a little more regularly, but whatever.  It's still a fun race to play.

I got almost 100 subscribers after about 20 videos, and then deleted them because I basically quit. Now I'm giving roguelike let's plays another try, this team with what I feel is much better commentary. (By the way, I sing in the beginning of each video for about 20-30 seconds, so bear with it :D)

Right now I feel like my production quality and entertainment value is quite... shitty, but as time goes on and I'm able to afford a better mic and stuff, I think I'll become a much more interesting speaker and be able to create some decent roguelike let's plays.

So, I'd appreciate it if you check out my channel and stick around for a while. I feel that my commentary is subpar, but I really would like an audience to work with and get some feedback from, and improve over time.

Also, if you have a channel or you'd like to collaborate on mine, I'm open to doing dual commentaries or whatever, so shoot me a message.

This was one of my few attempts to play as earth elementalist, and it turned out, that they are awesome.  

Fun stuff i learned during this run:  
 - Lee's rapid deconstruction is really good. i used it a lot on the holy Pan floor against Daevas, who resist shatter and love to block Iron shot.  
 - Shatter is one of the best spells, but it has its nuances. It can theoretically dish out more damage/turn, than anything else - in a deep ziggurat level i had 70+ kills with one cast while surrounded by Orcs. Insubstantial enemies are immune to it: On the downside i almost died on a zig floor full of smoke demons. But it turned out, that haunt summons only insubstantial stuff, so you can happily shatter any unique do death, while they are fighting your haunt summons :)   
- Tomb was a piece of cake, i cleared the 3rd floor within 50 turns.  

The hardest part was getting necronomicon (i did the first Zig just to get that book), i was seriously out of food at one point. And killing Cerebov of course, he way more dangerous than any other moster in Crawl.

Finally i got my best randart robe ever, i doubt, that the RNG can do any better:  
    the cursed +2 robe ""Cran"" {god gift, rElec rF++ rC++ MR SInv}
    (Okawaru gifted it to you on level 5 of the Vaults)   

but i never used it, the armour of robes is so bad, that even a Swamp dragon armour can best this randart."	t5_2rhpi	True

I know this is a bit out of the ordinary for ""roguelikes"", but I found an unusual and extremely satisfying way to get my roguelike fix and you guys should know about it: the Hexxit modpack for Minecraft.

The Hexxit modpack (that just recently came out) fills up your Minecraft world with crazy fantasy dungeons, loot, monsters, and even other planes of existence. It also minimizes the resource grind so the focus really is on exploring a super dangerous random world. Set it to ""hardcore"" and you have one hell of a creative roguelike game.

I'll be honest, I wasn't even a fan of Minecraft and had to be dragged into Hexxit. Now I'm hooked just like I'm hooked to ToME and DCSS.

To see some of the stuff in Hexxit that I liked, here's my rundown of the highlights: http://www.dorkadia.com/2013/07/02/hexxit-fantasy-adventures-in-minecraft/

And if you want to download the modpack right now, here's the website: http://www.technicpack.net/hexxit

Figured you guys might appreciate this, since we all own Minecraft, right?

Edit: You might have to hit the F5 button a few times on official Hexxit site. It seems to be a bit unpredictable."	t5_2rhpi	True

1357881241.0	16d3e6	[Tome] Guide: Higher Archmage - Arcane Specialist	HPLoveshack	43	1	23	"Higher Archmage specializing in Arcane/Aether is one of the most straightforward and powerful casters you can play.  Born into Magic racial talent is direct damage and damage reduction for Arcane Archmages and with Aether Permutation the synergy is incredible.

**Attributes** 

Magic &gt; Constitution &gt; Willpower 

Always max out magic at every level, put remaining points into Constitution.  Ignore Willpower until you max out both Mag and Con.  You will have both Manasurge (in the early game) and Disruption Shield to handle low mana situations as well as a variety of low mana escape spells and won't be sustaining any spells in the early game.  

**Equipment Priority**

* High:  +arcane damage%, +spell crit%, +hp, +mag, +con, -spell cooldowns

* Medium:  +spellpower, +mental save, silence immunity, crit multiplier, +physical save

* Low: +arcane resistance, +mana, +mana per turn, +movespeed, +spellpower on critical, +spell save

Valuable activated abilities to prioritize are Blinding Speed, Disengage, Telekinetic Leap, Phase Door, and any type of Shielding.  Arcane Eye and Stone Wall are nice if you find them at a power of 5 or greater.  Juggernaut and Evasion can sometimes be valuable as well.

Movespeed up to about 30-40% is actually very valuable for allowing you to back away to buy time for cooldowns without taking melee hits.

Arcane resistance becomes extremely valuable once you get Aether Permutation.

Crit multiplier is also extremely valuable as your crit percent approaches 50%+.  The higher your crit percent, the more valuable crit multiplier is as it usually comes in large percentages like +30%.  At the extreme high end it will become the most effective way to increase your damage output.

**Infusions and Runes**

* wizard/titan/psychic wild infusion (mental and physical)

* wizard/titan/psychic shield rune

* Rune of Reflection

* wizard/titan/psychic healing infusion

Get a wild infusion with mental and physical remove as soon as possible.  The resist % and whether it scales with a good stat are of much lower importance.  If you can't find one, stick with physical remove as silence doesn't start showing up until later, only confusion in the early game, however freezing and stunning are more dangerous generally.

Also, wizard runes/infusions are generally preferable and psychic runes will be unviable in the beginning.  Look for wizard or titan in the beginning.

**Escort Rewards**

Healing Light and Chant of Fortitude.  Get these if you get the option.  If you get the option for Premonition, consider getting it as well, can save you a few general points.  Otherwise get +Mag.

**Strategy while Leveling**

* *1 - 3*

1 Arcane Power, 1 Flame, 3 Lightning

1 Arcane Reconstruction, Phase Door - keep maxed

These will last you through the starting area for Archmages.  Command your staff to Lightning aspect and lvl 3 Lightning should kill most of the enemies in a single cast.  Don't bother sustaining Arcane Power. Aim Lightning to hit multiple enemies at once, use Flame to follow up, and remember to dodge the projectiles and stay out of melee range of the manawurms.  If you get caught with the manawurm manaburning poison, DON'T use your manasurge rune.  You will almost certainly die if you do, instead cast your highest mana spells to bottom out your mana ASAP.

Important:  Do not invest anymore class points into anything else other than 1 Flame, 3 Lightning.  You will remove the point from Flame and 2 from Lightning at level 4, relegating Lightning to a clean-up role and removing flame entirely.

* *4 - 7*

Manathrust - keep maxed, 4 Illuminate, 1 Lightning

1 Teleport, Phase Door - keep maxed

Get 4 points in Illuminate right away, then all points into Manathrust.  Command Staff to Arcane and devastate with Manathrust and Illuminate, use Lightning to follow up when necessary.   Remember to use Phase Door and Teleport to get away if things start to go wrong.  Illuminate might seem lackluster to some people, but trust me the huge aoe blind and lighting is absolutely phenomenal and it's only 1 more point to make it deal very good damage early on and still not bad later in the game.   Just be careful not to use it when you have allies/escorts.

* *8 - 15*

1 Glacial Vapour, 1 Freeze, 1 Tidal Wave, 1 Shivgoroth Form, 1 Aether Beam, 1 Arcane Vortex, 1 Disruption Shield

1 Probability Travel, 1 Shielding, 1 Overseer of Nations, Displacement Shield - keep maxed

New Category: Aether

Continue with the same strategy as before, autoexplore, lead with Illuminate, kill with Manathrust.  You'll have a few more tricks now to buy you time for Manathrust to cooldown such as Freeze, Tidal Wave, and Shivgoroth Form's Ice Storm.  All of which are great for managing multiple enemies, especially on multiple sides.  Against difficult enemies and bosses leading with Displacement Shield is a good idea if you don't have an instant cast shielding rune, if you do have the rune, use that then lead with Illuminate and follow with Displacement.  Aether Beam isn't very good yet, but it may be worth casting against casters for the silence chance, also ensure when casting it that you cast it at least 4 tiles away from you or you may silence and damage yourself with it.  Remember it is disarmed if an enemy walks on it, so put it beside their path to you or immediately behind them.

If you have a shielding rune, belt, or amulet, go ahead and sustain Shielding.

* *16 - 19*

Aether Breach - keep maxed, 1 Aether Avatar

Born into Magic - keep maxed

This is when your power really starts to focus and ramp up.  Just be careful not to kill yourself with Aether Breach, use it to open up on groups and follow up with Illuminate and Manathrusts or control spells or position yourself to funnel the enemy.   When using Aether Breach always ensure you are at least 3 tiles away from the edge of its radius (2 tiles between you and the edge), elsewise you may kill yourself depending on how the explosions distribute.  If you must use it close, ensure you are near full hp, have a shield up to absorb the damage, and phase door away from it after the first explosion, you will survive.  Also if all enemies die while Aether Breach is still active, do not autoexplore, you will likely run right into it to loot.  Instead tap your wait 1 turn key a few times until it's done, then autoexplore.

Remember if you find yourself in a bad position about to die, using Aether Avatar followed by Disruption Shield can save your ass, especially if your mana is also low, but not quite below 25%.

* *20 - 29*

New Category: Meta

1 Dispel Magic, 1 Spellcraft, Quicken Magic - keep maxed, 2 Metaflow

1 Aegis, 1 Arcane Shield, Shielding - keep maxed

You could try Temporal instead of Meta, but Meta is better in my opinion due primarily to Quicken and Dispel Magic.  Once you've maxed Quicken your spell cooldowns are reduced by 30% which is incredible for all of your shielding runes, heals, debuff removes, and teleportation as well as Aether Breach. If you can find at least 4% more spell cooldown on an item your Manathrust will drop from 3 turn cooldown to 2, which is extremely nice.  There is also an artifact staff that will reduce Manathrust's cooldown by 1 turn.  Manathrust every turn is ridiculous.

Once you get Aegis you can use Aether Avatar more safely as an offensive boost (25% increased damage, 66% cooldown reduction turns you into a beast).  Just put up one of your shields before hand and once the shield drops below about 50% use Aegis to recharge it, if you get into real trouble use Disruption Shield.

Begin sustaining Arcane Shield and consider replacing any weak shielding runes you have with healing runes.  The shield you get from the healing rune will likely be very close in power in addition to the healing.

* *30+*

Prodigy: Aether Permutation

3 Dispel Magic, 5 Spellcraft, 5 Pure Aether

5 Thick Skin, 1 Armor Training, 1 Highborn's Bloom, 1 Arcane Eye, 1 Keen Senses

Once you get Aether Permutation focus on maxing out your arcane resistance and +max arcane resistance.  They will cut the incoming damage your receive by a huge amount.

Spellcraft and Pure Aether will continue to boost your damage output and also are great companions as Pure Aether will make your spells not only more dangerous to the enemy, but to you, due to the arcane penetration.  However, with Spellcraft maxed and active you don't have to worry about that at all and can even do neat things like drop Aether Breach on your own head to clear out melee range enemies.

**Endgame Notes**

For your final prodigy Corrupted Shell, Spine of the World, and Unbreakable Will are solid defensive choices, but I definitely lean toward Corrupted Shell, hard to argue with 150 extra hp and more saves based on con.   By combining Corrupted Shell with Featherwind and Blur Sight (for a measly 42 mana sustain) you can actually get decent defense ratings as a mage too; you end up tough as all hell if you take Corrupted Shell with Aether Permutation.  Meteoric Crash or Bloodspring would be my choices for offensive prodigies.

You will be investing in willpower during the final stretch of levels so your mana will increase very quickly and you will have extra mana to use on sustains.  Keen Senses and Premonition are good choices, Featherwind is also nice if you have the extra points to max it out.  It may still be be worthwhile just for the carrying capacity even if you can't max it though.   Just be careful, if it is disabled for any reason while you're over your base carrying capacity you will find yourself encumbered in combat, not a good position.  Consider teleporting away and resustaining Featherwind if the enemies are actually dangerous.

Extra class points should be spent in Arcane Vortex, Aether Beam, and Disruption Shield.  Although, 1 point into some of the sustains in the Phantasm Category is another option.  I don't think it's a particularly good one though.  Keep in mind generally the first few points into the arcane direct damage talents give better returns than the last few, to the point that increasing all of your secondary arcane damage abilities (everything other than Manathrust and Aether Breach) to 2-3 rather than one talent to 5 is a reasonably good strategy.

Tactics don't really change at this point except that you should be a hell of a lot more resilient, just don't get too cocky, your con is most likely maxed at this point and your hp isn't going to be increasing very quickly anymore.  Don't underestimate the value of Arcane Eye.  It can be very nice for scouting areas and ruining the days of invisible/stealth enemies.  However, it does require a full 5 points to truly shine.  It can sometimes be found on items at higher than 5 power and is worth sacrificing a bit to wear if you do find one of these.

After surfing over to the website, I learned that the game is now Freeware anyways. Shit was cash. 


So I booted it up. Knowing roguelikes tend to great take glee in watching you suffer, I played carefully. Taking care to ration my food, not stir up trouble in villages, etc. However, something would ALWAYS go wrong. My last character before my current one decided attacking an old man on the road was a good idea. Things looked great until I was knocked out, and died.



Determined to not be beaten by a silly game though, I started again. As a fisherman on the coast, I set up shop on a narrow inlet flanked by deep forests. Villages were all around. Despite making good catches of fish, I wasn't getting anywhere. The mean men in the village refused to trade with me. 5 days into my game and I was tired of being stone-walled. 


Sneaking into a village under cover of night, I set fire to piles of twigs beside the tool shop of the mean owner. The fire spread to the shop, and soon it was ablaze. My eyes glazed over. ""Finally"" I thought, ""I can have stuff!""


The village seemed to get mad at me for burning down the mean mans house, and before I knew it a little posse of angry Driik fishermen were barreling through the woods behind me. It didn't take long too lose them, but it was certainly exciting. This burning technique is definitely a keeper. 


My characters name is Tiikut, and since the burning incident I have taken to calling him Tiikut the Mad. Tiikut went north for 3 days after that, putting plenty of space between him and the Driik. He now has constructed his first cabin (After only 1 3/4 months!) and is fishing like a champ. His food supply is ample, though has started to spoil even though it is in his cellar. Guess the May weather is just to warm.


Either way, things are looking good. Come fall I'll sneak into the Koivula villages to the east of me and steal their grain and what not so I can have seeds to plant myself come next spring. For now, I just want to keep food supplies up, and build a trap fence. A looooong one.

2.  'Camera' perspective makes it impossible to tell where you are in relation to other sprites. This will end up with you often taking a hit when you didn't expect to. While this would normally not be a problem, except for the fact that...

3. There is no way to heal HP other than consumable use, and all units appear to move at roughly the same speed. Basically, you can't avoid combat and you can't heal HP without getting lucky with drops, so RNG solely dictates your success in the early levels moreso than an actual traditional roguelike, which rewards caution and macgyver-esque preparation. 

4. It's basically impossible to tell what's going on. Graphics are never the selling point for a roguelike, but it's very important to be able to distinguish between the player sprite and enemies, between the environment and interactable objects, the relative location of enemies and what each enemy is and what it does. Color coding and extended ascii accomplishes this task in most roguelikes, and simple high-res tilesets accomplish it in others. Hack Slash Loot deliberately cribs the graphical style of Powder to such a degree that it feels like plagarism, but unlike Powder does not have the excuse of literally being a game limited to the platform constraints of a gameboy. The sprite artist seems to be the same one responsible for Realm of the Mad God, except Realm of the Mad God has the decency to outline sprites and put them in high-res environments. 

5. It's the most expensive indie roguelike to date and does not appropriately reflect the production values at all.

Dredmor had a lot of problems initially with pacing, controls and RNG fuckery, but it actually improved over time in areas users complained the most about. Taking a look at the official HSL forums shows that the developer is completely unrepentant and unwilling to recognize any of the (very legitimate) criticism coming his way at all. If you really feel like you need to support the indie development scene, at least play the demo first before you pitch money to the wrong kind of developers. I wish I had.

However as has been said it misses out a few... which is kinda inevitable, but maybe we should have a community collated bundle?

I own www.roguelikebundle.com, which has alas languished in inattention for some time now as the original plans for it fell through. It seems like a good home for this endeavour though, with game profiles and torrent links for Windows, Linux and Mac.

What do people think? And what games should we have? A personally drawn list would include:

Nethack, Rogue, DCSS, ADOM, Angband, Brogue, TOME, DoomRL, AliensRL, Berserk!, DiabloRL, Dwarf Fortress &amp; Lazy Newb Pack, Unreal World, Cataclysm, IVAN, RedRogue, Sil, Powder, Zaga-33, Infra Arcana, UnNetHack, PRIME, Hydra Slayer, Vicious Orcs, PrincessRL, HyperRogue III, nLarn, The Slimy Lichmummy, Frozen Depths, LamdaRogue, Smart Kobold. Maybe a few other classic 7DRLs.

Suggest more! And if you want to contribute in organising let me know.

Edit: Okay, following up here's an open spreadsheet of a number of games with some details:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai4woBhgpQ7hdGVzSktGZjZ1Q19Ea3JDTTRFWVJmTmc&amp;usp=sharing

I'd appreciate some help in filling in gaps. Add more games if you like. Please do not remove anything.

The criteria for including a game is that it's reasonably finished (so not ADOM II for instance) and fully playable, runs on modern systems and is something you'd recommend to people to play (ie it's good). There's a subjective column for good interface/ui - in general this should be strictly a 'y' for very good UI only -  insert a comment if you feel the need."	t5_2rhpi	True

I played brogue, dungeon crawl stone soup, nethack, wazhack, etc...

In DF you can find towns, necromancer towers, tombs, bandit camps, sewers with a tribe of mutants, dragons' lairs, forgotten beasts...

What I found in that roguelikes is a repetitive cavern, where I have nothing to do except killing and killing.

You may remember me from this post: [I beat Shiren the Wanderer on DS](http://redd.it/ug19v)
The last time around I did some grinding and built up a powerful weapon. This time around I stuck to a more traditional rogulike play style. I did NO grinding. I did not backtrack to prior levels. I only used weapons and items I found on the road. I got lucky and found a melding jar. The melding jar allows you to boost your weapon more quickly.
I was skeptical that it could be done on Shiren the Wanderer. The game seems to push you toward building up powerful weapons. But you can do it.
Some highlights:


* I beat the final boss using a doppelganger staff.
* I paralyzed the other monsters surrounding the final boss.
* I escaped 2 monster houses, barely.
* I survived being changed into a riceball and being slowed. I was surrounded by two monsters. I changed back in time to blitz them with a blastwave scroll.(damages all the monsters)
* I got lucky when a blacksmith upgraded my weapon. He gave it a two point boost instead of the usual one point boost.
* I was lucky to find the mastersword on an early level. I also found at least two airbless scrolls. They upgrade your weapon.

tl;dr to sign up: **SSH** into ancardia.us.to, give adom/adom, follow prompts, [configure your SSH client](http://ancardia.us.to/#putty), then log in with your new account.

ADOM was not made with a public server in mind, and certainly not made with running multiple versions on the same system in mind.  But a few community members have written supporting scripts for Linux to enable this and a lot of cool features.  There have been at least 3 other public ADOM servers, but all of them are now offline, so I've taken up the torch, and also added my improvements to the software.

Features:

* Publically available over SSH (Texas, USA)
* ADOM 1.0.0, 1.1.1, and 1.2.0p3
    * Plus an enforced [Eternium Man](http://ancardia.us.to/guidebook/challenge.html) (1.1.1) mode
* [ADOM Sage](http://kiserai.net/adom/sage/) option (except for 1.2.0p3)
    * Automatic backup saves, and automatic restore when ADOM crashes
    * Star sign selector
    * Stat reroller
* Safe to disconnect or lose your Internet or run out of battery: the only time the server will lose your playing time is if Rackspace in Dallas-Fort Worth loses power.
* Optional session recording &amp; playback
* Guidebook available [here](http://ancardia.us.to/guidebook/) and on the SSH menu
* Co-op mode
* Spectate other players
* Hi score announcement on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AncardiaUS) and [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/adom)
* Public [hi score lists](http://ancardia.us.to/adom_hiscore/)
* Optional public HTTP access to your homedir: Download your FLGs (victory logs) and save files for local playing
* Immediate bug-infested temple access

Please read the readme; it answers most of the common questions.  The server thread on the official forums is [here](http://www.adom.de/forums/).  The most reliable way to ask questions about it (including my server) is in that thread.  

P.S. the [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/adom) has a useful bot named soradombot that will give you detailed but concise information about an item (with @i itemname) or monster (with @m monstername), and some sometimes-useful community members."	t5_2rhpi	True

There might also be people with Counter Strike, Team Fortress 2, League of Legends, and whatever else it is you kids play.  If anyone has any suggestions or requests, feel free to make them.  :)

Who will be playing?  Lots of people, hopefully!  There will at least be members from ##reddit-roguelikes, ##gooncrawl, and ##crawl joining us.  Clearly if you're reading this you're invited, too.  In what other situations will be be able to be better at a game than elliptic?

about it? Are there other roguelikes like it?"	VRCkid	40	9	68	Have been playing this game for a while now and I must say it is a very enjoyable roguelike. Plenty of things to do, plenty of things, and its humor to fight make it a really great and addictive experience. One of the main features, for me, that really made it stand apart was that it had actual graphics and animations. What are you thoughts about the game and do you have any knowledge of games similar to it?	t5_2rhpi	True

For no good reason at all, I recently wrote a Python script to sift through my morgue files and find out how long I've played Dungeon Crawl. I figured that others might want to know this piece of useless information, so I put it up on Google Code so anyone can grab it:

[Autopsy home page](http://code.google.com/p/autopsy/)

How to use it:
It's a one-file script that you place in your morgue directory and run. You  need Python 2.7 installed on your system. The script will create a log file that contains your game time info. I should run on Windows, OSX, and Linux, though I've only tested on Windows. If you run it on any system, please leave some feedback. Obviously this will only work if you have your morgue files locally, so if you only play on akrasiac or another server this won't be very useful.

Leery of running some yahoo's strange script on your machine? You probably should be. The nice thing about Python being an interpreted language, however, is the script is not compiled so you can look it over before you run it. You can also view the source [here](http://code.google.com/p/autopsy/source/browse/autopsy.py) before you download anything. If you're worried about your morgue files, you can create a temporary copy of your directory and run the script there. The files are opened with read-only access.

Right now it's pretty limited in its functionality as it only reports game time information: how long you've played, average game length, shortest and longest games. I am interested, however, in hearing what other information people would like to see. Now that the necessary bits are in place to read all the files, create a log, etc, it's just a matter of implementing new stats. Things like:

* Number of runes collected
* Common causes of death
* Breakdown of races/backgrounds played
* Win ratio (bahaha)

A few final thoughts:
**Does something like this already exist?** I may be reinventing the wheel, but I don't know.
**What else would you like to see?** If it's in the morgue file, we can probably get it.
**Am I doing something stupid?** If you know Python and see something face-palmingly dumb in the script, let me know. I'm new to Python.
**Did it work and/or crash?** That would be useful information. You can either file a bug using the slick interface on the Google code page or list it here.

Love,
Michael"	t5_2rhpi	True

This is a guide on playing the Halfling Berzerker. [Here's my tournament profile](http://crawl.akrasiac.org/tourney10/players/jaeger.html). A lot of how I got in second place is due to my strategy of playing HaBe.

The moment you begin the game turn off training in Armour and in Axes. You won't be needing either of these. Early game is spectacularly consistent, which the draw of this combination. 

Pick up and wield the first short blade, whatever it is. This includes knives. You want to be gaining Short Blade skill instead of Axes right away. If you find robes, put that on instead of your animal skin. Be smart about swapping up equipment. You should try every glowing or runed short blade you find, with proper caution.

When you see something difficult, such as a pack of gnolls or an ogre then you berzerk. But be judacious about how you berzerk. Halflings are blessed with sustenence, so you will get to berzerk more frequently than other berzerkers, however, it is still a resource you have to manage. 

Say you have an ogre tailing you. You definitely want to berzerk to kill it, but you should try to accomplish as much as you can with your berzerk. So shou(t) to attract attention and try to get a line of monsters including the ogre to follow you into a hallway. When you have a nice line of an ogre, a snake, a kobold, and a hobgoblin, then you would have a great opportunity to berzerk. You get to kill all four at little cost. This is actually a safety tactic, because it ensures those monsters won't be around _after_ the berzerk ends and you are vulnerable. By the way, you can berzerk against jellies, but switch to a weapon you don't want damaged first, such as your starting axe.

Use the general smart tactics against ranged attackers. If you see an orc priest, run to a corner, shout to gain his attention, then wait one square away from the corner. This way he'll only have a single turn during which he had a range advantage over you. You should let stealth train, so that you can setup battles in your favor.

Anytime you aren't hungry sacrifice every corpse to Trog. You eat less than other races, so you will gain piety faster. You can start getting your first god gifts before you reach the Lair, if you play well. That can make the Lair quite the breeze.

You should pick up any buckler you find along the way, too. On level ups, increase dexterity. Your combined EV and SH in the end game will make you extremely hard to damage. 

In Lair you should be making your stash and testing scrolls and potions. My rule of thumb for the ID mini-game is to test very high frequency potions right away, as those are generally healing and other common useful potions. Same with scrolls. In Lair I test any scroll and potion I have two or more of. Potions and scrolls I have only one copy of and are unidentified, I stash. What you want to do is collect more scrolls and potions, and bring them back to the stash to test when you have the appropriate quantity.

The play order of branches you should follow is: Lair, then Orc, then dungeons until you find Vaults, Vaults until you find Crypt, almost all of Crypt (you can back out if liches scare you, though berzerkers fare pretty well), then Swamp/Snake/Shoals/Hive if you have rPois (but don't finish them, as the last levels are dangerous). I like to do Elf:1-6 after that. Elf:7 isn't recommended until much later.

It's actually fairly difficult to write a guide for Crawl, because so much of the game is dependent on tactics, and I need som nice way of doing ascii drawings to illustrate a lot of them. Perhaps I can create an anotated ttyrec sometime."	t5_2rhpi	True

The idea is it's basically a roguelike in reverse. Normally in most roguelikes, you're an adventurer making my way down through a dungeon to some treasure or boss at the bottom.

But I thought it might be an interesting idea to be the boss at the bottom, and to influence the forces on each level of the dungeon to face a party of maybe five computer controlled adventures who are trying to kill me / steal my treasure.

The goal being to coordinate the creatures on the levels to wear down the adventures and make them give up and try to escape to the surface.

1367261799.0	1dcsik	[DCSS] Weekly challenge #84: Become the dragon	simpaon	35	6	42	"Hey, listen (also, skip to the end for the short list of rules)! 

Ever since you were a tiny lizzardling cub it has all been the same. Growing up, attending draconian kindergarten, advancing through newt school and finally graduating (with measly grades in everything except Salamanders &amp; Scions: A Brief History on the Evolution of the Man-Drake) you have always been the littlest one. You know, the guy everyone picks at.

As time passed you watched both your brainer and brawnier brethren pass you by. Night after night you have curled up, nose to nail, in the smug warmth of the embers in your furnace and dreamt. Of glory, of greatness, of one day surpassing every one of your tormentors. But then, during one particularly long and sleepless winter night, it struck you. There's a way to turn this around and show them what you are capable of, what you desire! You must become a true dragon.

Ah, to be a dragon. To one day sore the windy skies. To perceive your mortal cousins as nothing but fleshy lumps, nothing but feeble foes. You would dominate them, plunder them, kill them! One day your name will be widely spread and feared by all. You will become the dragon.

Much of your energy from this day on is spent on long hours of studying. You decide to learn the art of transmutation, to dabble with the dark powers of transfiguring yourself and dominating other. Instead of taking a position as a berserker trainee or fire mage disciple you seek out the shadiest of masters, Gorlaf the Pockfaced. If you once were an outcast you are now doubly so. Even your proud draconian parents refuse to acknowledge their shame of a son/daughter and your old classmates snickers behind your back when you run into them on one of your countless trips into town to stock up on chewing tobacco, cheap brandy and pretzels for Goralf.

And still this apprenticeship of yours yield little. You trudge away catering to the every need of this grumpy old fool, yet he teaches you nothing - nothing! Only after *years* of hard work, social degradation and a slowly growing depression have you learned a single spell that is not capable of transforming more than a single part of you at the time.

And so one day, as Goralf sends yet another of his snarky requests your way, you snap. Summoning claws you rip the old fool half to shreads in your fury before your temper sets. And yet the scrawny old man still hangs on by a thread.

""*You are not even strong enough to end a poor old man like me, how will you ever succeed in this fools errand*"", he chuckles, and coughs in pain.

""*There is but one solution for you now. You must meet your faith in order to fullfill your dreams. Take the book! Head for the dungeon! Go now for you will never again face naught but cold hard justice in this town*"", Goralf gasps with his last stuttering breaths. And you know that he is right.

**RULES:**

* You must enter the Dungeon as a DrTm.

* You must learn Dragon Form and get it down to 10% failure rate or below in order for your score to count.

* You must not worship a good god, they do not support your long term goals of world dominance.

* You must not use up your wealth. A dragon seeks to amass a glorious stash of gold and jewels, so do not spend a single coin for the durarion of the game (unless to buy a spell book containing Dragon Form, after all that is your ultimate goal). 

**FAQ:**

**Q: How do i participate?**

A: Abide the rules and post your result here or in the End of week 84 thread that will appear on sunday. 

**Q: I don't like dragons, why can't I play some other build instead?**

A: Lol. Everyone likes dragons. 

**Q: What if no one manages to learn Dragon Form well enough? Will that be the end of weekly challenges forever?**

A: Well, in that case I guess to person who provides the best explanation as to why he or she failed to meet the conditions will be declared the winner. We wouldn't want the competition to be ruined forever, now would we? 

**Q: Is Goralf in any way related to Crazy Yiuf?**

A: Yes, funny you would ask, as a matter of fact he is. They are cousins, but Goralfs mother - Yiufs aunt - married a draconian man, so that makes Goralf a dracgnollian. And yes, that is the actuall term."	t5_2rhpi	True

Lil_Druid	31	2	106	"So as the title implies, I've been getting more and more interested in the genre since seeing things such as FTL and Dungeons of Dredmore lately(I'll be honest I'm not even 100% sure if these are actually ""roguelikes"", but they're close enough to me) as well as reading about a few others, such as Elona(or something like that, can't recall the exact name but I could not for the life of me get the download file to work properly when I tried a few weeks ago, so couldn't play it...).

I basically have never played any roguelikes except Azure Dreams for the Playstation(again, possibly not 100% a roguelike, but close enough to me) which was actually one of my favorite games as a child, so my experience is incredibly... low. I looked around but it seems most of the ""what are good beginner ones?"" posts are at least a few months old and, while I took glances at them, I still wouldn't mind some up to date opinions, especially based off possible new releases/updates.

As blasphemous as it might be to say on here, ASCII roguelikes aren't really *huge* for me, so while I might take a look at some suggested, I'd certainly prefer some with at least some graphics, even if it's ""tilesets"" like the ones in various Dwarf Fortress mods, though the better the graphics, such as in FTL, the... well, better! Don't think I'm saying I prefer graphics over gameplay at all, though, since above all creativity is my biggest draw to a game, so the better the customization, replayability, etc, the more I'd enjoy it most likely.

On that note, *ARE* FTL and Dungeons of Dredmore considered roguelikes and would they be good beginner ones?"	t5_2rhpi	True

1344611707.0	xzzpp	I've decided to start keeping a diary for my characters.	Fushigidane	35	5	22	"EDIT: This is for DCSS

I'm typing them up in a text document as I go at the end of each 'day'. I consider any area I traveled and the experiences I had in them for the diary trying to remember that anyone entering the dungeon would act as if he knew nothing about it. Each 'day' ends after I've descended to a new unexplored floor. This is my first entry for my demon-spawn berserker. Naturally, each diary is unfinished (you can't write about your death, you know.)

Day 1 D:2 - A good start to my exploration. I found some armor. I also found a feathered hat and gloves. Most demons think these human frivilties as junk, but, I know they are useful. I've found some unidentified scrolls and potions as well as these oddly cold darts. I'm more of a throwing dagger person, though, but I've decided to bring them along with my 3 daggers. Hungry.

Day 2 D:3 - What a great start! I did battle with a human female magic user named Jessica and later an imp named Ijyb. To my surprise I've found that when I am in danger I sometimes can summon a minion, presumably from the chaotic plane. I've found this delightful sword that 
seems to sap the life from those I hit. It's not very strong otherwise, but, it is very useful. Very hungry.

Day 3 D:4 - Challenges abound! Yesterday I used the term 'imp' jokingly, but, today I ran into an actual shadow imp by the name of 'Grinder'. I have heard of this one, a peon who used to torture those unfortunate enough to cross into our dimension. Very dangerous indeed... for the weak. I found a temple with many altars. Ridiculous idea. Trog is the one true god, except maybe Logonu. I'd smash their altars if I had time.

Day 4 D:5 - Who in their right mind sets up stores in a dungeon? Madness. I didn't get a good look at the shopkeepers; they kept themselves hidden behind a cloak, but, I could hear from their voices (if they could be called that) they were no specie I recognized. I was able to buy some scrolls. I will have to remember to return to the book stores later to burn them. Trog will be pleased. This dungeon is starting to try my patience. I enjoy a good fight but so many in a row is maddening. A warrior, even a berserker, needs his rest. However, I enjoyed the challenge. I was faced by a bloated toad named Prince Ribbit and a kobold with human slaves by the name of Pikel. They teamed up on me, but I got some minions of my own. The slaves were happy to be free of their master, but, at the time I was too hungry and exauhsted to kill them. They wander free for now. I later also did battle with another human magic user named Menkaure. She fell quickly.

Day 5 D:6 - This last floor was mostly boring. Found a weird helmet with wings coming off the side. Meh. Hungry.

Day 6 D:7 - I encountered a lot of zombies today. They just kept coming! My minions took care of them though. More interesting, though, is I found some stairs down into a mine-like cave area. I'm not sure which path to take. I'm thinking going through the mines though. Hopefully I can get some recovery time away from all these monsters I've been finding.

EDIT: I just realised it might be a good idea to start the diaries off with a header, maybe changing it based on that character's personality. In this case I imagined my demonspawn beserker as an impatient person who got bored and decided to write a diary before he went to bed simply because there was nothing else to do. MAybe that's why his didn't have a header, even a simple one like 'Diary of Fushigidane' because he didn't care enough."	t5_2rhpi	True

1331586555.0	qtgu8	[DCSS] YAVP - 15 runes on first ever ascension	chowriit	32	0	9	"[Character morgue file](http://pastebin.com/EpDX9DKS).

First ever ascension, and as I've been playing on and off since 0.3.4 I think it's about time! :)

I'm pretty proud of this, I've never made it higher than XL15 before I'm delighted that not only did I manage to win, but got a nearly ""complete"" win. I was hoping to beat a Ziggurat too, but on Zig:18 I got a Pan Lord floor which really kicked my ass and forced me to random tele/semi-controlled blink to the exit, apport the good looking loot and jump down to Zig:19 only to find an even worse floor, so I decided not to risk my first win.

Mummies are, all told, an *interesting* species. I think they're somewhat underrated - once you get Sif Muna's free MP power they become pretty damn good, and when you get Orb of Destruction as well you can really tear through almost anything short of Zig5, Crypt and Pan Lords until you get Fire Storm castable. You never have to worry about food, so you can scum Abyss all you want relatively safely, which more than makes up for the terrible skill aptitudes. The downside is ultra-lategame you seem to cap out earlier than I think other characters do - your low stat gain means that even at XL27/27 spellcasting/27 fire magic you'll probably only have ~30 int even with items included, which still gives a ~6% fail rate for fire storm, and you don't have quite the HP or mana pools of other characters. Plus, while being undead is great, necromutation is better very late on as you can restore lost stats or avoid dispel undead/holy attacks.

Saved all my enchant weapon scrolls and used them all on that demon trident to get a good backup weapon, and trained up polearms to get it to minimum attack delay, then only had to use it once when I got cornered in a spider-themed zig floor by multiple ghost moths (mana draining stare meant they kept me on 0 mana even if I channeled every turn) - ended up doing better damage with several wands of lightning anyway.

So as a starting point, I think it'd be interesting to have a regularly rotating set of people streaming the roguelikes they play once a week (say for five hours on a Saturday, every Saturday), with a donation box open to go to a charity of our choosing. People could play different roguelikes depending on their preferences - it'd be nice to have a good variety going, as many of us seem to specialize in particular games.

If you have settings you want to transfer to the download version (such as having ascended, equipment in the under/overworld, etc) then follow these instructions:

During a level press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to activate debug mode. In the debug menu is an option to save your settings to a file. Once you have that file you can then load that into the downloadable version and your settings will be transferred.

This is technically cheating, hence it's undocumented - but it's not fair to rob someone of having ascended. I won't be allowing games in progress to be transferred I'm afraid, you'll have to find another way to save scum. Please finish your run if it is in progress.

I'm floaty-happy right now, I've been hopping from roguelike to roguelike for a long time now.  I also feel like I earned this one -- by the time I got to level 5 with 13 strength, no rings and only unenchanted leather and a dagger, an unidentified axe (of quietus it turns out, used it 'til the end of the game) a slew of enchant scrolls and a lightning staff, I knew it was time to make my own luck.  I dumped the enchants into the staff and went for it.  The game eventually did start throwing plate armors at and finally some rings, but I found I leaned most heavily on the lightning staff.  At times I was wandering around with five tentacle horrors, the tensest moment was a face to face battle with a dragon, ended up killing most of my horrors.  After that, though, I just walked on down, grabbed the amulet, and left.  :)

Maybe it's time to get serious about DCSS, and then, maybe, finally, I'll be ready for nethack.

This popped up while playing this week's challenge.  I decided to go Draconian for the breath attack (basically a free conjuration spell).  But I forgot how bad the armor restriction was, so a huge amount of experience has been going into shields.  (And evocations for more attack options, a rod and the disc of storms seems a good combo.)  A shield of reflection makes Elf so much easier.

1335409451.0	ssy5r	On purposeful movement in a Roguelikeish	Worthless_Bums	30	2	27	"This post probably belongs more in [/r/RoguelikeDev](http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev), but I've had pretty good luck having discussions with people in [/r/Roguelikes](http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes) before so I figured I'd try again :)

My game is a squad/turn based Roguelikish (link below, I'm trying not to make this a shameless plug post). Initially I wanted the focus to be on squad based mechanics - movement, flanking, position swapping, covering fire, decisions of that nature. Having just released alpha version 0.4, I've had some time to reflect on the direction my game is headed in.

The number one complaint about my game is that it is tedious and frustrating to move the squad (consisting of a maximum of four characters) across the map. This tells me (and I could be looking at this the wrong way) that there is too much ""dead space"" in my dungeon layouts where the player is simply exploring and nothing of note is really going on like fighting or going after shiny objects.

One way to fix the tedium is to have squad members auto-follow a leader when a explore mode is toggled. Another is to collapse the squad onto one avatar in explore mode and disallow combat while in that mode.

An  obvious and cheap way of fixing this is to spawn more enemies and to do so dynamically. I'd rather not do this. Early on I had open maps with hordes of monsters swarming the squad. While hectic and fun, it grinds on the player after a few levels of that.

What I'd like is a more claustrophobic, steady movement type of gameplay. Traps are something I will implement, as are ambushes and more intelligent monster AI to work in groups. But there's still dead space to deal with!

So really my questions are, ""What can I do to make the game more claustrophobic to Roguelike players and make them want to move ~~slowly~~ more purposefully with the squad intact?"" It seems to me that a lot of Roguelikes have auto-explore mechanics which I personally find boring.

I think the following would  help:

 - Add hidden rooms/objects. But then I'd need a mechanic to uncover them. I'm not entirely sure how well this would work in my game.

 - Mini-bosses that are fast and aggressive (i.e. death to the stragglers).

 - Traps. I'm not sure how a squad walking into a trap would be better than just one person. Maybe flood an area with lava so that it would actually be better to send only one scout ahead?

 - Monster Ambushes that would kill one or two squad members, or simply an unprepared squad. One way I've considered doing this is using spawning holes. They can randomly spawn monsters if their tile is clear, so perhaps having a squad member stand on a hole (or bomb it to close it - not implemented) while the squad moves through a narrow passage would be a good idea.

 - Critical failures. Maybe a squib round blows up in your face, damaging your character and lowering weapon stats. Probably a poor idea since it's mostly RNG. I tried implementing weapon jams you had to (T)ap (R)ack (Bang) to clear else the next shot fired would have catastrophic failure. It was not well received.

 - Limiting ammunition and forcing players to melee. Currently the squad consists of more furturistic type characters thrown into a world of low tech and magic. Melee attacks are very low damage and currently don't have any effects like knockback. But limiting ammunition may encourage players to melee weaker enemies in order to save ammunition for tougher enemies. This has the perhaps unfortunate side effect of encouraging the player to send the ammoless character into a possible death trap to test the waters.

 - Specific enemy attacks designed to chip away at squad health instead of kill anyone outright. Possibly a cheap option that takes control out of the player's hands. Think of a Frost Troll charging - it powers up then the next turn slams through every tile in some line.

 - Monsters currently only get one Action Point (basically one move or one attack) per turn. Higher level monsters will have more to draw upon which should make the player more wary of running into a room.

 - Squad based abilities. I haven't implemented anything like this yet. Shows you how smart I am, eh? Something really overpowered that can only be used every 100 turns or somesuch, in combination with lesser abilities.

 - I have formations implemented (i.e. standing in a square boosts squad defense) but it's a crappy mechanic. I mean this sincerely as the guy who wrote the code. No one uses it. Even I don't use it. It's much more a, ""Hey, I got some extra bonus because I moved my squad into a position that was optimal for this situation anyway."" Maybe I could tie this into squad abilities somehow, but I think that's just my bias for not wanting to throw away code.


Okay, that turned out to be a lot longer than I thought. Sorry about that. Any thoughts, even ""You suck, your game sucks, and your knowledge of Roguelikes sucks!"", is appreciated. Really. Often times you don't know what you don't know. Feel free to tell me to just suck it up and make an auto-explore mechanic because it's the cat's ass.

High Elf Wizard of Vehumet, 3 rune win.

I found a book with fireball and a ring of fire really early on, so I played a little faster through the branches than normal (I played a lot of the branch ends as soon as I got there.)  My general strategy was to repel missiles, fireball everything, and ice beast/ice could whatever was still alive.  After I could cast fire storm I starting using it as my main damage source, relying on gourmand to keep my food up.

Killing Mennas made me happy &gt;:D  The only other time I ran into him with a wizard I tried to fight him and ended up almost dying twice.  This time I had fire storm.

I almost died a few times, always due to me being stupid.  I almost killed myself with poorly placed fire storms twice, once taking myself to &lt;30 hp with a few crypt monsters nearby. That was probably the lowest I got the whole game.  A few times I ran out of mana trying to fire storm something while no buffs were active for me and had to random teleport (once in Zot:5, the first time I ended up manaless next to an arch lich and had to tele again.  I landed by exit stairs that time, luckily.)

The Orb run was a lot easier than I feared.  Most levels I walked through uneventfully (maybe stealth helped?)  I did have a scuffle with a demon thing and had to randomly blink a lot to get up the stairs without him.





**My Background:**

I've been playing DCSS off and on for around 6 months with little success (never got much past the Lair entrance.)  I tried a few combinations, but found I really liked the wizard playstyle the best, so I almost exclusively play them.

This past week, I decided to start seriously trying to win.  I read a bunch of posts on r/roguelikes and on CrawlWiki that helped a lot.  One in particular about ""playing like you have 1 hp"" made me really change how I think about combat.  I stopped thinking of my health as a resource to be traded for more turns during fights.  Now when my health drops I stop and think about my options, and usually err on the side of retreat/defense buff.

Also I think trying out Vehumet instead of my usual choice of Sif Muna helped.  The extra mana from kills and cheaper fire storm was invaluable.  I really liked being able to switch out spells at will, but when I found out that you can forget spells by destroying spell books Sif Muna was a lot less appealing.

Ok, done rambling.  I'm just excited that I finally won a roguelike!  Thanks r/roguelikes, for all the helpful posts and comments I have read while lurking here :D"	t5_2rhpi	True

After 190 deaths and 10 months of trying just to survive, I think I've finally got the essence of this Game and managed to escape with this famous and guarded orb.

I've always been a follower of Trog and mainly a Mountain Dwarf Berserker. I tried a few other combinations, but then realized I'm a natural born berserker.

I've failed every incursion to the Elven Hall 5 so I decided to skip it forever.

I think the key of this game was rN+++ and the tons of exp in the Vaults.

Finally, I want to thanks my fellow friend Palparepa, who helped me a lot with his tips and to presented me this amazing game.

Thanks to DCSS team, Reddit and Palparepa again!!!... Now it's time to celebrate in this Halloween night in Santiago de Chile, South America.

 * mass downvote an individual's posts

 * report posts just because you don't like them

In particular mass-downvoting a new player's posts just because they didn't enjoy your favourite game is immature and very unwelcoming. The fact that several people are doing this reflects badly on the whole roguelike community. If we want an active and sustained community we need to be welcoming to new players, otherwise we'll end up a bunch of elitist jerks making snide remarks in the dark corners of the internet.

The latest version of Dungeonmans is available, with improved dungeons, rebalanced combat, and more secrets to discover! Details and download link here:


http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/56637190/dungeonmans-the-heroic-adventure-roguelike/posts/547609


In particular, the way dungeons are generated is much more interesting. Previously there were lots of situations in Dungeonmans where you'd go from large room to large room, and while the fights were fun the areas were kind of boring after a while. 

I changed this to add more interesting rooms, that allowed for things like hidden alcoves, multiple intersections, and cover. You can still kite enemies to the door if you move and jump around enough, but it isn't nearly as plain as it used to be. Here's an example.


http://dungeonmans.com/images/kickstarter/update04/old_vs_new.png


In addition, there's a secondary pass over the map to create extra doors between areas that might be able to use them. During generation, each room is built on top of a room generated higher up the tree. That means starting rooms usually have lots of doors but once you get further out that dries up. Extra doors being added in help create loops and switchbacks that make chasing / hiding from monsters more entertaining.

I hope you guys give the new build a try, I'd love to hear what you think!

I started trying a CK because I was looking for an interesting character to try, and this surely delivered.  Minotaur because I want to win once with each race if possible and would prefer to avoid MiBe or MiFi, so I used this to get rid of Minotaur from my list.

This is the second character I have gotten a 15 rune win on (the first being an OpMo of TSO).  I learned a lot of important lessons playing this character too.  I am never ever doing the Tomb again unless I have statue form castable, or am undead, or have necromutation.  In this run I just decided to man mode it, but I had to use up almost all the available healing in the game to undo all the rot curses I racked up.  I guess the other big lesson was to never underestimate Xom's fickleness, carelessness in his actions nearly killed me several times.

Now for what everyone wants to hear about an extended CK endgame:  how much did Xom mess with you?  Short answer, A LOT.  Some of the more memorable recaps:

GOOD actions

-Giving me the effects of a potion of experience on D8-10 or so, and then almost immediately doing it again!  Didn't end up being too important as I already had my skills in good shape by then, but can't complain.

-Gifting me a wand of Heal Wounds (the only one I found all game until Zot 3-4).

-Confusing one of the rune guarding bosses of Pand mid fight, take that ""immune to hostile enchantments"".

-Extremely good mutation set for most of the game.  At one point I had free rElec, RC, RF, +6AC, +20% max hp, clarity, regen, with only a few minor bad ones like blurry vision.  I also spent most of the extended endgame with free rMut, although by then I had lost most of my other good mutations.

BAD actions

-Teleporting me in LoS of about 20-30 mummies including many greater and priests on Tomb 3.  He then swapped me out of my fog scroll immediately, and when I tried to run for it, teleported me deep in the vault again.  I managed to get out after several teleports and running for it, going down to 20~ hp a few times.  He also swapped me on my final way out into a worse position...man did he ever want me dead in the Tomb.  Also right after I finished escaping and clearing the stairs he cast necromutation on me....where was that when I desperately needed it in LoS of 12+ guys who torment you Xom?!

-While fighting Ereshkigal he teleported me away when she was low, causing all my buffs to fall off and her to heal to full.  I was very low on buff supplies by then too.  When I re-engaged and buffed up Xom cast me into the Abyss as I was very low on hp (still confident against boss though).  Finally managed to kill the boss on third try...she must have made some kind of deal or bet with Xom.  I disapprove strongly.

-Teleporting me in LoS of 2 Orbs of Fire on Zot 5, before I had cleared almost any of it.  During my frantic spam teleports attempting to get out I almost made it, having to only cleave through a single ancient lich to freedom, only to have my weapon swapped for a draconian's and me not realize it immediately, so I had to teleport again.  Barely escaped with my life and managed to find my weapon using my backup one.  Xom also animated/swapped my weapon during several tense battles...definitely one of his most devastating abilities.

-On D1 during my ascension he tried one last time to do me in, polymorphing me into a wolf spider as I was fighting a Pan Lord and a couple other dangerous enemies.  I ended up just blinking and running for it, escaping in spider form.

Some other things of note in the run are the fact I found very few decent cloaks all game, preservation I didn't really need that much was about the best one.  Also I found no decent boots at all, where were my boots of running.  I somehow managed to NEVER find a cap or wizard hat in the entire game...I couldn't believe that.  Empty equipment slot for endgame saddens me so much.  I used 3-4 aquirements on armour but no dice.  There was also a treasure trove that needed a +5/+5 demon blade, but no demon blade was found either.  Pretty bizarre item shortage overall, but I persevered.  I had a lot of stupidly good items regardless so I can't really complain much.

In any case, it was a fun run, easier than I anticipated for no TSO and with Xom meddling, so try a CK yourself if you need some added insanity in your DCSS.  If anyone has any interesting sounding race/background combinations let me know since I am looking for my next character and don't really have many ideas yet.  So far I have won with DECj, OpMo, MuAK, DSSk, SpEn, TrWr, and MiCK now.  A lot of melee hybrids or close to pure melee, with 1 pure caster.  I haven't tried a ranged weapon user yet (throwing on TrWr closest) so maybe one of those, or a caster using a school I haven't touched much yet.  Out of my winners, I have enjoyed the TrWr the most, worshiped Chei there and had a blast."	t5_2rhpi	True

Kelshmo1	29	3	47	"I have been playing many different roguelikes for quite a while, and I would really like to make some kind of video on the genre. I would like to have a discussion on the subject of fun in roguelikes, or maybe what makes the genre compelling, or rewarding to play? It doesn't even have to be what makes the games fun, but I'd like to delve a bit into what the appeal is. 

What keeps me coming back is knowing that (for the most part) i'm going to get a different experience every time. It's the unpredictably that most roguelikes share that I just LOVE. It seems that the industry is full of boring, and predictable games/mechanics, so playing a good roguelike is such a breath of fresh air. Another thing I love is the difficulty, even at times of extreme frustration, games like Brogue, FTL, DF (adv. mode) always impress me with the fairness, and balance they can have, while still being tough as hell.

Sorry for rambling a bit there, but I would love to hear all your opinions on the genre, what makes it fun, what keeps you coming back, and also, what do you think the future of the genre is?

1595145 Soren the Sorcerer (level 27, 150/150 (151) HPs)
             Began as a Spriggan Enchanter on July 29, 2011.
             Was the Champion of Kikubaaqudgha.
             Escaped with the Orb
             ... and 4 runes (of 4 types) on Aug 3, 2011!
             
             The game lasted 15:15:33 (140490 turns).

Spriggan enchanter is fun and very effective, and hunger was never really a problem. This was my first time seeing any moderate success with a spellcaster, though I had once gotten to Zot:5 with a Kobold Berserker.

Thanks to everyone in #rrogue for their support! I'd have most likely died a horrible death if it wasn't for the good advice there.

**Game Highlights:**

stabbing is fun:  
 &gt; 2869 | D:3      | Noticed Terence  
 &gt; 2871 | D:3      | Noticed Sigmund  
 &gt; 2877 | D:3      | Defeated Sigmund  
&gt;  2879 | D:3      | Defeated Terence  


Nothing like coming back later to take care of unfinished business (note the turn counts):    
&gt;  39034 | D:15     | Noticed Roxanne  
&gt; 112456 | D:15     | Defeated Roxanne  


One of the two uniques that I decided not to kill:  
&gt;  51739 | Vault:4  | Noticed Mara  

The other one? well...

SO YOU WANT YOUR FIRST RUNE? LOL NOPE HERES BORIS  
&gt;  71313 | Shoals:5 | Noticed Boris     
&gt; 71510 | Shoals:5 | Got a barnacled rune of Zot    
&gt; 71510 | Shoals:5 | HP: 7/140 [Boris/iron shot (44)]      

I was happily invisistabbing the entire merfolk population when Boris showed up and woke up everyone in the room with the rune. I barely escaped with my life and never looked back.    


So I was feeling kind of cocky and decided to clear Elf:5. It was certainly no cakewalk, but then along comes a deep elf high priest with a triple sword of distortion:    
&gt;  82649 | Elf:5    | Cast into the Abyss (deep elf high priest)     
&gt;  84003 | Abyss    | Got an abyssal rune of Zot    
&gt;  86000 | Elf:5    | You pass through the gate.       

I was certainly not expecting to find the rune so quickly, I was just trying to find a way out (note that it took me about 3500 turns to find the first exit out of the Abyss).    


After that, I decided to leave elf:5 for another time and I grabbed the Swamp rune.    


Also, this:    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed Erolcha    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem    
&gt; 101426 | D:25     | Noticed a toenail golem   

Yep...      


Zot was tough, though it helped that draconians can't see invisible. I made plenty use of Summon Shadow creatures in zot1-4, and spammed Haunt all through zot:5.    
   
Also, I learned a valuable lesson:     
1. Shadow Creatures can summon moths of wrath in Zot.  
2. Moths of wrath can cause their enemies to go berserk.  
3. Berserked Orb Guardians are horrifyingly scary.   
From then on, I just made liberal use of haunt.     


And, of course, finally:     
&gt; 139760 | Zot:5    | Got the Orb of Zot   
&gt; 140490 | D:$      | Escaped with the Orb!    

The ascension was quite easy after I got the orb. I was expecting more scary things, but i was able to safely make it to the surface and barely took a scratch.     "	t5_2rhpi	True

I'm still kind of amazed that I pulled it off and I can't stop grinning. I know I did some stupid things and nearly died about 15-20 times but I played carefully, didn't get overly impatient, and got a little lucky with gear (even though I was severely lacking in resistances). 

I have to ask, how the FUCK does anyone beat Tomb or Hell? I poked into both a little and got the fuck out pretty quick. I assumed Pan would be the same and avoided it altogether. Got a really lucky rune in Abyss after being banished there by a Zot trap. Picked it up literally a screen away from where I landed and then got a portal out not far from there. 

Man, I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and wanted to tell some people who actually know what the game is. Morgue file [here](http://pastebin.com/5JViRF4p). Disregard the 18 hour play time, a lot of that was idling to give myself a break and looking stuff up on the wiki. I'm still kinda blown away by how annoying Zot:5 was.

Your level, skills, and attributes can all grow limitlessly, no caps, and a dungeon with infinite levels for infinitely harder enemies too.  The potential and quest systems discourage mindless grinding.  I've put over 100 hours into it and I feel like I'm nowhere near beating it.  Further, the skill system allowed my melee warrior to learn a bunch of magic skills later on without hindering his melee skills in any way or wasting finite skill points.

That said, I've put over 100 hours into it and sort of need a break.  The scarcity of procedural dungeons makes it somewhat repetetive.  I'm looking for more games that are similar.  I really enjoy the turn based dungeon crawling of roguelikes, but get annoyed at creating temporary characters that get chewed up and replaced and having the game completely forget they existed.
So in general, I'd like games similar to Elona, specifically:

*No permadeath (or some other form of persistent progress like Rogue Legacy)
*No level/skill caps, or just extremely high ones
*No game end, or just one that takes an extremely long time to get to, or lets you keep playing after."	t5_2rhpi	True

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, they are always hungry and will seek out corpses to consume. Eating helps the Skeleton regain lost health, and also if left long enough, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight, and there are no detected breadcrumbs) and so it proceeds to patrolling the waypoints using simple A* pathfinding as before. If while in patrol mode the Skeleton detects a corpse it will set the corpse as its destination and proceed to run directly to it using the Seek Steering Behaviour.

2 . If a player is detected, the Skeleton will switch out of this mode and chase the player instead in full alert mode. Skeletons ALWAYS prioritise the player over eating corpses.

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, it will begin eating it. The eaten variable for this corpse increments every frame. While eating, the Skeleton's field of view is reduced to 45 degrees instead of 90, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons, so the player has to make sure this doesn't happen!

5 . At that's it, nice and simple behaviour made possible by combining and tweaking the previous behaviours in a certain way. This is the beauty of behaviour trees, it is quick and easy to create new meta-behaviours by combining the building blocks of the previous ones.

**The Next Few Days**

As some of you may already know - my game TinyKeep is on Kickstarter and there are currently only 7 days left of funding to go! If you enjoy reading these kinds of technical articles, please consider pledging so I can continue active development of the game. Currently I have accrued almost half the amount I need, but as Kickstarter is all or nothing I need to make the full £22k or I lose all my pledges so far. If I get funded, I plan to keep on releasing articles on all aspects of the game's development, including AI but also game mechanics, procedural generation, multiplayer networking, 3D graphics &amp; animation, performance optimization, workflow - and everything in between! So please help if you can!

**Changes since v1.4:**

* Dungeons now include interactive “quest rooms,” which include lock-and-key puzzles, collapsing/flooding terrain, hidden items, elaborate traps, challenges, boss monsters and more.
* All new weapons: spears/pikes, which hit an adjacent enemy and the enemy behind it; axes, which hit all adjacent enemies; and maces/hammers, which hit twice as hard and require an extra turn to recover afterward.
* Added item description screens, which include useful statistics about the item and are accessible via the inventory or by examining a discarded item on the ground.
* New monsters, items and weapon/armor runic abilities.
* Monster descriptions include statistics about how certain staffs and wands will harm or affect the monster, and whether the monster is carrying an item that it stole from you.
* Messages and monster descriptions are color-coded for clarity.
* Monsters that can blink will now do so more intelligently to approach enemies, flee attackers and escape harmful terrain.
* Numerous tweaks to make colors crisper and the interface less distracting.
* Allies get stronger over time at a faster rate, are able to attack wall turrets, and are better at following you down pits and stairs.
* Monsters are no longer generated in sight of the level start.
* Merged Potions of Healing and Extra Healing; eliminated Scrolls of Sanctuary.
* Gold is now generated independently from items, both to reduce the variance of per-game aggregate gold quantity and to stop gold from being generated at the expense of items.
* Rings now auto-identify after being worn for a while, similarly to armor and weapons.
* Subtle change in ally color to distinguish allies from enemies.
* Spectral blades and other inanimate creatures do not avoid gas clouds if the clouds would not affect them.
* Wisdom is now a ring instead of an armor runic.
* Reflection is now an armor runic instead of a ring.
* Cancellation is now called negation; certain monsters are marked as animated by magic and will die if negated. New Scrolls of Negation will negate all creatures and items within your field of view (but will not affect items in your inventory). Negated weapons, armor and rings will lose their magical properties, and negated wands and staffs will lose their charges.
* Removed Scrolls of Sanctuary.
* Added a point of damage to darts.
* Creatures exposed to fire will burn about half as long.
* The duration of entrancement no longer varies with the target’s maximum health.
* A uto-resting will terminate if you are embedded in an obstruction and it dissolves.
* When pink jellies split, their health is divided between their progeny, and they have commensurately more health initially.
* Items and monsters won’t spawn in hallways or doorways, but items may spawn in shallow water.
* Detect magic icons are now also color-coded to distinguish good items from bad.
* The ‘D’iscoveries screen specifies whether the detect magic potion will flag that item as good or bad magic.
* Wands and staffs that are meant to target enemies once identified will not default to auto-aiming at captive monsters.
* You can now see allies that are invisible (and wands of invisibility will auto-identify if you use them on an ally).
* New special effects for magic mapping and aggravate monsters scrolls."	t5_2rhpi	True

Why are we doing this?

You will (hopefully) see some of our active chat members/operators making posts about other rl's in the near future.  I personally plan on winning a weekly and getting everyone to play DoomRL or ADOM.

Hopefully a mod here will change the sidebar for us.  :)  And I hope to see everyone still in the new chat.  "	t5_2rhpi	True

It has stunning graphics, fun game play, an interesting story, and a user-friendly game controller. But now I cannot stop thinking about DCSS. I thought I would try it out once. It was interesting, but not outstanding. 

But wait...I died so quickly. Maybe I'll play it one more time... That's better; I've got the hang of it now - this character could withstand anything.

Hello? Who are all these slaves? Why won't they die quickly? Why am I the one running away? Why am I dead on the floor with blood running from my lips and slaves ripping me to shreds? And, for god's sake, why am I starting a new character?

Just three days ago, I would casually say, ""I think I'll play Red Dead for an hour or two."" But now I think, What did I do wrong that time? What sort of character should I make when this one gets wiped out? And that question there, where I'm already accepting of my demise and trying to think of new strategies, THAT'S the most amazing part of DCSS. It's actually entertaining to know I'm going to get my ass kicked.

All you DCSS people have turned me into a masochist. And I'm taking these few minutes to thank you. I no longer have to wonder what I should do every time I get a spare moment in my day.

1371377158.0	1gg50i	"""Infinite Cave Adventure"": public telnet server"	diggr-roguelike	33	6	16	"Hello all.

I've put up a public telnet server that hosts ""Infinite Cave Adventure"", a sequel to ""Diggr"" and a different roguelike.

Connect with any telnet client to host **diggr.name**, port **20020** to play.

I've attempted to make a roguelike that shifts away from roleplaying towards boardgames and strategy games. 

Some highlights:

* 'Grinding' is impossible or pointless.
* No experience points, the game advances when you face new challenges, not when you collect kills or equipment.
* A very limited inventory that makes stockpiling impossible. Choosing what gear to keep and what to discard is a major strategic choice in the game.
* A steep 'ramping' of power levels and an aggressive hunger clock makes the game fast-paced.
* Each level is different in flavor in strategy, to make advancing interesting. (You advance by visiting different locales, not by incrementing a number.)

The game is open-source, the sources are hosted at http://code.google.com/p/incavead/.

It is written in C++, for maximum performance and portability. Dependencies are minimal -- a recent `g++` and OS support for BSD sockets should be all you need. (Running the game on your phone should, theoretically, be easy.)

Thanks, I look forward to your comments and suggestions.

* When going out of Ice Form, the vampiric wield effect triggered instantly starving me to death

it wasn't a particularly lucky run and i made several dumb mistakes. there is a crucial item in FFP, the Strengthening Jar, which improves weapons and shields placed in it for every floor you advance. this run i didn't find one until floor 45 (out of 99) and the monsters are waaaay overpowered at this point unless you have been improving your gear. 

and then i stupidly threw it right into the water on floor 56, losing the maxed-out items i had in it! i almost gave up right then and there; you are likely to find only one or two in the whole dungeon. but since i had already put a few hours in on this run, i decided to press on and found another in a shop a few floors on. i had several close calls getting transmogrified by wizards into a riceball (riceball status removes any protection you may have had,  makes your weapons and armor useless, and removing any abilities except moving and weak attacking) and getting blinded and dropped 10 experience levels. at least three times i had a tank level-up to the max by killing other monsters and had to chip away at his hitpoints 1HP at a time. i didn't find an Herb of Revival (one of the best semi-common items, which brings you back from death one time) until floor 95.

1294224342.0	ewj58	Brogue: Taking level 7 by fire.	Tychotesla	31	5	13	"Brogue is really fun. I never thought I'd say this, but the ASCII/Unicode graphics are really visually fantastic, and, shockingly, more visually appealing than any tiled roguelike I've seen. It's also simple, short, and plays well. Also, playing with fire is **fun** in it. I won't mention too much so that you can be surprised by things... but here's just a taste:

Our story starts soon after arriving on dungeon level seven, when across a lake I saw two goblins dancing in worship around one of their quaint totems. It makes a beautiful scene, [so I take a picture](http://i.imgur.com/dIxrl.jpg), tourist that I am. Truly, goblins have a rich and varied culture.

Then I launch a fireball across the lake ( [lucky screenshot captured this gorgeous Kodak Moment](http://i.imgur.com/ktnKL.jpg) ).

The first shot only damaged one goblin a little (it was standing in water), and all the while the totem was taking pot shots at with me with lightning bolts, [so I decided to up the ante a little by starting a ~~grassfire~~ fungus fire around them](http://i.imgur.com/BvPwx.jpg).

This plan was a triumph. [Everyone died](http://i.imgur.com/ndRWc.jpg).

A short time later I got cornered in a bog by a nefarious acid mound while testing potions. Fortunately one of the potions I'd drunk IDed as fire immunity... so I lit the swampgas up with my trusty *Staff of Firebolt*. [The results were a flaming success](http://i.imgur.com/mLR7n.jpg). (**Do not try this at home**. Do not test potions in swampgas unless you've already IDed *Potion of Incineration*. Wash thoroughly in case of accidental contact. Be aware that lighting gas gives blast damage as well as fire damage.)

Unknown to me the swamp gas extended through a door to the north and ended up lighting another fungus fire, so in a few turns I found myself able to strategically use the flames to my advantage while fighting vampire bats.

Another little while later I found myself a room full of monkeys! That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but fortunately the punchline would be hilarious: ""*Potion of Incineration*"". Nothing beats that joyous glow and feeling of warmth you get the first time [you watch monkeys on fire](http://i.imgur.com/ZQW8m.jpg) fleeing from the molotov cocktail you tossed on them while they dreamed precocious monkey dreams. Especially when you're standing in front of the only exit picking them off with a mace as they try to escape the burning room. Oh, monkeys!

Finally, I'm done with the level. I celebrate by winging another shot across the lake in remembrance of how I started this level and [Ooooo... pink jelly!](http://i.imgur.com/E0HIR.jpg) One shot later and it's dead and I'm down the stairs.

Hello level 8! Oh hey, [I wonder what's going on on the other side of that lake](http://i.imgur.com/Ch8Ti.jpg)? You know, by that flammable fungus?

I'm playing MiBE for quite a long time since I just want to beat this game for once. This time 'Lucky' really gets lucky. I basically get artifacts on all slots and got some good mutation resistant after drinking potion of mutation and potions of cure mutation some times.
After picking the Orb of Zot it is much easier than I expected. I've got a boot of speed and wand of digging I didn't meet any tough enemy.

1354131279.0	13y62c	[DCSS] Week 67 Challenge - Ogre Ninja	Yxven	28	2	31	"If you thought ogre wizards were rare, then you probably haven't heard of the small ninjutsu school founded by ogres. This school produces assassins that are feared across the world for their rock ""shurikens,"" but they are now quietly mocked by other ninjutsu schools. Apparently, you can't call yourself a ninja if you're not sneaky. 

Needless to say, the ogres have killed every critic they've found. That said, it's time to prove ogres can be sneaky once and for all with a fresh batch of recruits. You'd think that only ogres would dare to attend this school, but trolls and mummies have been sighted in the dining hall.

Rules:

* You must be an ogre, troll, or mummy.
* Stealth must be trained from the start until it is maxed.
* You must use manual skill training until stealth is maxed.
* You may only have 2 skills training at one time until stealth is maxed.
* The week ends 12/3/12
* No focusing skills until stealth is maxed.

Pro tip: If you use a club in a sneak attack, it produces a confusion effect.

I haven't beaten either, so maybe I'm not experienced enough to judge, but they certainly feel very different: my experience with ADOM, which, all in all, I would say has been more fun so far, has felt more like an adventure game - I find myself more interested in the ""story,"" or in the particular character I'm playing, however long (or not long) he survives, and for this reason, it seems like it's not as much about beating the game as it is about playing the character (still talking about my experience here). DCSS, though I like it too, feels more gamey (not necessarily in a bad way - variety is the spice of life).

I have been playing Diablo 3, and it has been rather unsatisfying so far. Granted, they need some time to work out the kinks! 

Anyway I was checking out kickstarter, which led me to Indie Games on reddit, which lead me to here.

I tried out Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, and in short, it is AMAZING. I've just been working through the tutorials so far. The controls are not easy to pick up though, Castle of the Winds did not use the whole keyboard like this game does.

However, I absolutely love the openness of the game, and it seems like lots of options, lots of things to interact with, and lots of items. 

Is this true with most of the games in this genre? Is this one of the more user-friendly games, or is there another I should try out first? I am not big on ASCII and like some nice graphical representation of what I'm seeing, doesn't need to be too fancy. I tried out Dwarf Fortress and couldn't hang. :/

1337827824.0	u24od	[DCSS] How to automatically delete your Bones files when you launch Crawl	HotSake	29	6	26	"Since I disagree with the concept of player ghosts (feels like being punished twice for dying), I wrote a simple batch file to delete my bones and launch DCSS. If you'd like to do this as well, just copy the following code into a text file, change the game path at the end to match your own location, and save the file with the .bat extension. Optionally, change the path to the no-tiles executable if you like. Then, run the file when you want to start DCSS.

    @ECHO OFF
    cd %appdata%\crawl\saves
    for %%f in (bones.*) do DEL %%f
    START C:\Games\Crawl\crawl-tiles.exe

Remember, it only deletes bones when you run the batch file, so if you die and restart without closing Crawl, you can still encounter your ghost. Hope this helps some of you play the way you want to play!

P.S. Haters: please don't downvote just because you think everyone should deal with player ghosts. Players have the right to tailor their experience for maximum enjoyment, and I'm only trying to make that easier. Thank you."	t5_2rhpi	True

I just wanted to share with you the very first version of the roguelike I'm working on, jsRogue. This is an extremely early build of the game, so it's lacking many important features like items, saving/loading games, a minimap, etc. But this is the very first fully-functional and minimally playable version of the game, so I thought I'd share it with you.

jsRogue at the moment is a very simple roguelike developed using the JavaScript/Canvas technologies, so you can play it from inside any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and IE9).

Although I've lurked here for a while, I'm relatively new to the roguelike community. Some questions I have for you more experienced crawlers:

1. Are there any free tilesets/art assests that I could use for the game royalty free or for a small charge?

2. Are there any other roguelike communities on the web where I should consider posting jsRogue?

3. If you play the game at all, what feedback do you have so far?

Website: [http://jsrogue.com](http://jsrogue.com)

Instructions: [http://jsrogue.com/instructions.html](http://jsrogue.com/instructions.html)

PS:
If you're using firefox, give the browser a little bit of time to compile the javascript so that it runs fast. Your first couple turns may seem a little slow.

jsRogue currently uses only VIM-style keybindings for movement. If you're having trouble remembering them, click on 'Options' at the bottom right corner of the screen and check 'Always Show Directional Help'

My character is a level 37 alchemist. I have abilities that allow me to fork the time stream so I can test out alternate strategies with relatively low risk. I have the ability to pull meteors out of orbit and send them crashing down on my foes, and I even have a crown that does the same thing. I have a wand that allows me to focus gravity and move enemies into a clump so I can hit them with AoE spells effectively. My golem carries a bigass stick whose base damage is in the 150 range. I have two different shields, three ways to heal myself, and four ways to teleport out of a jam. I can speed myself up to over 768% so 1 in game turn is stretched out to, what, eight?

That's just one character! That's just tiny handful of abilities. And with all that, the game is still challenging as hell! I'm just in awe, and stunned that this is just being given away."	t5_2rhpi	True
1370293842.0	1flut6	[DCSS] Weekly Challenge #87: Lava Orcs, Gargoyles and Djinn! Oh my!	WinterShine	27	5	35	"Together they stood at the entrance to the dungeon, each with something to prove.

The gargoyle smashed a fist into its open palm. ""They think us mere constructs. Nothing more than forms hewn from rock by magic. Not a proper race at all, they refuse to respect even their own laws when it comes to us.""

""This is nothing,"" replied the djinni. ""At least they leave you alone. Our power -- our very essence -- petrifies them. They would hunt us down and slay us all, were they capable. I shall see to it that they are not.""

""You concern yourselves with the affairs of mortals,"" interjected the lava orc, ""yet it is the gods themselves who have turned their backs on us. Beogh has turned from my people, calling us a foul mockery, leaving my people to suffer. I shall both punish them, and prove them wrong.""

They were silent for a while; then, as the sun began to dip over the horizon, they stepped as one toward the gate which led into the infamous dungeon. There was a wrenching sensation as they stepped through together. Vision went dark, then sight came slowly back into focus, as though waking from a deep slumber. Each looked about themselves, but found only the ancient walls of the dungeon nearby. Those who seek the orb of Zot must do so alone; they had heard this, but now they knew.

Nerves settled once again, each steps down the staircase leading to the dungeon proper, with the goal of retrieving the orb and bringing their race to power. May the best race win.

---

Prove your chosen race is the best!

**Rules**: The rules are simple. Play as either a lava orc, gargoyle or djinni, retrieve the orb and escape the dungeon. Best score wins. You can post your wins here, and I'll also post a thread sometime Saturday as a last call of sorts. On Sunday (in that thread) I'll declare the winner, and they can create the next challenge.

You can **[download trunk here](http://crawl.develz.org/trunk/)**, or choose trunk from the menu when playing online. Need motivation to switch? No more nausea!

---

Here's a brief rundown of each race:

**Gargoyle**: Gargoyles have rN+, rC+, Claws 2, Fangs 1, Talons 2, and Slow Metabolism 1. They are immune to being petrified, but can elect to petrify themselves.

**Djinni**: Djinn have total immunity to all fire and hellfire, rN+++, and rC-. It takes two levels of rC+ to bring them to even, and three to get rC+, which is their maximum. Instead of HP and MP bars, they have a single Essence bar. 1 MP costs two essence. Djinn do not need to eat, and instead pay hunger costs by gaining glow, but any mutations they get from glow are temporary. Djinn have to 'float' over water which slows them down, but they can float over deep water. They can pick up items in shallow water, but not in deep water.

**Lava Orc**: Lava Orcs have rF+, conserve scrolls, saprovore 1 and stoneskin. They move slowly (1.2). In additon to HP and MP they have a temperature meter. As temperature increases, they gain (in this order, as temperature increases):

- Normal movement speed
- rF++; lava magic boost (currently just bolt of magma?); they lose stoneskin
- rF+++; rC-; fire magic boost
- Fast movement speed; burn attackers

Heartless49	29	4	23	"I have played countless roguelikes, including some classics such as Nethack, Rogue, Moria, etc... and I love them more than most other games/genres in existence. They are always games that I can go back to and pick up for a period of time, whether it be for a few minutes or for a few days/weeks/months.

However being that I call myself a hobbiest, I don't fully research strategies and I don't really look into how to get far or the best race/class combos, or anything of that sort. I just kinda play on a whim and do what I feel.

This playstyle however has left me with a few disadvantages. First, I've never 'beaten' any roguelikes, let-alone even gotten very far at all. Second, I've never really understood the proper way to do certain things.

The one that I keep coming back to over the past couple of years is DCSS because of its ease-of-access as well as its brilliant interface... it really has combined a lot of the best features of other roguelikes, lol.

Anyways, getting to the point of my post here: The one thing that I'm confused about right now, and I'm actually going so far as to ask for help/guidance on it, is how does everyone USUALLY figure out what various scrolls/potions do...

I mean, do most redditors just use them and hope for the best? or is there something I'm missing... I know that you can get them identified... but I VERY rarely get that lucky, lol.

Let me know, I'm playing DCSS right now, and would love to know what I should do with the 20+ scrolls that I've collected in the last 30 minutes, hahaha."	t5_2rhpi	True

This is a fun new Sprint map but its only available in trunk (0.12), so you will either need to play sprint trunk on one of the online servers or go [download a development build](http://crawl.develz.org/trunk/) and play local like the anti-social heathen you know you are.

Speaking of anti-social, don't forget to swing by the ##reddit-roguelikes IRC channel (link on the sidebar ----&gt; ) and idle with the best of us, or maybe actually join and ask for tips on this week's challenge, whatever floats your boat.  Rumor has it that our own resident Ogre king, ophanim, holds court there regularly.

Per the usual convention, ~~highest score wins~~ and the contest will run 9 days until Monday, November 19th.  Good luck!

This was actually my first time in the extended endgame at all, so I'm surprised it went as well as it did. Thanks to the guys in ##crawl for helping me with my annoying questions about Pan, and to this subreddit for sharing many endgame tips in other threads. 

A few things I learned:

* Quick blades of pain are amazing.
* Slings are a cool choice for a Skald's ranged weapon, even moreso when when you consistently get great ones. Sling + Haste = machinegun.
* Oka's wrath isn't that bad when you can blink out of it and run away.
* Pan really is easier than Hells, if you are prepared.
* Even when you have rF+++, doing Gehenna as your first extended branch is a BAD IDEA.
* Regeneration (spell, troll armour, ring) is very useful for characters that spend a lot of time running.
* Tornado is pretty cool, but maybe of limited usefulness in 0.9.
* Control Undead is not as bad as the wiki makes it seem. Situational, yes.
* Mass confusion isn't particularly great.

Feel free to add wisdom or argue with these points below. I'm just so excited, I want to talk about DCSS all day!

1266857956.0	b52sk	Let me tell you all about ToME.	ColdSnickersBar	28	6	28	"Troubles of Middle Earth, or ToME, is an Angband variant that could easily be more described as a total conversion. It expounds upon the Tolkien theme of Angband, and adds much content. 

You can download it here: http://t-o-m-e.net/download.php?tome_current=0 Be sure to download the binary, and not the source. Personally, I recommend downloading version 2.3.5 because v3 is still alpha, and has some bugs that I couldn't deal with.

I see so much on this reddit about ADOM, so I decided to give ADOM a try. After playing it for a week or so, what really struck me is how much simpler and how much more casual ADOM is. Compared to ADOM, ToME is much more in-depth and complex. For instance, in ToME, you can: build magical items and craft artifacts; you can customize your character much more than in ADOM; there's a much larger overworld with many more places to explore; and many more NPCs with varied quests and nuances.

ToME is also longer. You can expect to build the same character in ToME for months or more. I've had characters in ToME that lasted more than a year. The power curve in both games seems pretty balanced, but in ToME, there's more power to be had: you eventually find god-like equipment and powers. If you manage to win, you will have battled balrogs and other greater demons, armies of great wyrm dragons, Sauron, and defeated Morgoth (Sauron's dark god). You even have the choice at the end to gamble it and follow Morgoth's beaten soul into the void and destroy it forever - a nearly impossible feat.

**Places:**

The areas to explore are more varied and colorful. The ""dungeons"" are larger, and have varied generation algorithms to match their themes. For example:

* The Barrow Downs ""dungeon"" is generated to be made of various paths through trees and rocks, caves, and stone tombs.

* Moria is made to be sections of winding stone caverns interspersed with dwarven structures and great halls.

* Mirkwood is generated to be like winding paths through dark forests, meadows, and streams.

* You can go to the Heart of The Earth, where the walls move like water every turn and can even swallow you.

* There's an underwater cave where you can die if you don't breathe water, and your gear will dissolve unless they're protected from corrosion.

* There's a castle of illusion with glass walls that slowly drives your character insane.

**Equipment:**

The equipment system is nearly limitless. If you like to collect gear in RPGs, ToME has a much more comprehensive system than ADOM. There are thousands of unique artifacts that each have personalities of their own. For instance: Mormegil, the dark sword of Turin; the phial of Galadriel that shines light forever; the mighty hammer, Grond, that you can take from Morgoth after sending him into the void; each of the 3 Rings of Power; each of the 7 Rings of Power; each of the 9 Rings that you can take from the defeated bodies of the Nazgul (although, it's never a good idea to wear those ones); and, the One Ring, which is an entire strategy decision itself on whether to wear it when you get it, or to destroy it.

You can craft your own magical items, and you can even create ego items and make legendary artifacts. 

**Some screens:**

* *Chillin in Bree:* http://imgur.com/rHexR.gif The windows surrounding my main view are extra terminals. You can turn these on from Window &gt; Visibility. Then, you set what you want each terminal to show by typing ""="" for options, and then going to Window Flags. It's easy from there. Then, arrange your terminals however you like.

* *Examining an artifact:* http://imgur.com/EisSL.gif Here, you can see the details of this fully-ID'd unique item.

* *Skills screen (for a hobbit assassin):* http://imgur.com/a4FsE.gif Somwhat similar to ADOM. As you level, you get skill points. You type ""G"" to ""G""ain skills. The skills are hierarchical. Child skills contribute a fraction of each point to their parent skill, so if you spend your points on swordmastery, you'll gain a little in weaponmastery, and a little less in combat, for instance. The numbers are: skill level [how much each spent point raises the skill]. There's also a special abilities list (""N"") that you can purchase for a set amount of skill points. Unlike skills, you don't improve on abilities - you buy them once, and you often have to save many levels worth of points to get them.

* *Exploring the Barrow Downs:* http://imgur.com/fY0Av.gif Notice that the dungeon is a winding maze made of forrest trees (the green blocks. They can be chopped with a bladed weapon, and the dark green are small trees which can be walked through), natural stone (the brown carrots), and tombs of man-made walls (the gray blocks). Each area in ToME has different level generation algorithms.

* *The overworld (with tile graphics):* http://www.t-o-m-e.net/wilderness-2.2.png

To give you an example of how the game can be, there's a strategy where you play as a Posessor (a kind of mage that permanently leaves the body he's in to take over the corpse and gain all its inherent powers), and then take the body of either the guardian of Moria's gates - a giant squid-like creature - or the body of a many-armed demon like a marilith, and then use all your new limbs to carry many magical swords, or wear all the Rings of Power at once. Or be a necromancer and resurrect a powerful unique enemy to be your undead slave - complete with all their powers in life.

Ask me anything about ToME, and if I know the answer, I'll answer your questions."	t5_2rhpi	True

What's new: I added more multiplayer features, inspired by sandbox games like Minecraft.

You can now permanently change the dungeon. Currently you can add stairs, add traps and store items for permanent safekeeping. (Yes, the structure of the dungeon is the same for all players, and other people playing the game will see your modifications too.)

Hopefully this will make the game much more interesting -- dying in the game is now a much more strategic business. (Even if you can't win this particular game, you can still do your bit of 'civilizing' the dungeon, which should make successive attempts easier.)

1372524841.0	1hbfhr	[DCSS] Weekly Challenge #89: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger	ManMan91	29	7	7	"This week we're creating the next step in the evolution of mankind... with mutations! The winner will be the creator of the best new race (i.e. your character) by next Friday night, judged by the following scoring system:

- Racial mutations (displayed in blue) do not count. We want to create a NEW race, after all.

- Bad mutations (displayed in red) subtract from your score. Each bad mutation subtracts 50,000 points from your total score. We want to create a BETTER race, after all. Note that the penalty for bad mutations is far smaller than the bonus for good mutations (see below), so quaffing a potion of mutation is still a good idea (well, probably...)

- Good mutations (displayed in light grey) add to your score. Each good mutation adds 500,000 points to your total score. This is how you make your race the best. [All Jivya mutations count as good mutations for this purpose]

- Multiple tiers of the same mutation stack, but in a special way. Second tier mutations give you 1.5x the base bonus/penalty, and third tier mutations give you 2x the base bonus/penalty. For instance, Claws 1 would give you 500,000 points, Claws 2 would give you 750,000 points (not 1,000,000), and Claws 3 would give you 1,000,000 points (not 1,500,000). Tiers higher than third count as third tier for this purpose, so that Dex -3 and Dex -5 would both subtract 100,000 points from your score.

- Mutations that stack with your base race's mutations (displayed in cyan or magenta for good and bad mutations respectively) are treated like they would be if you had acquired them as a human. For instance, a Naga with Slow Movement 3 would have only 50,000 points subtracted from their score since they started at Slow Movement 2 - in other words, Slow Movement 3 is treated as a tier 1 mutation for a Naga.

The above bonuses and penalties modify your normal crawl score - there's nothing like the quest for the Orb to prove the worth of your new race. Characters without at least one good mutation don't qualify.

Sources of good mutations include:

- Drawing the Helix card from the deck of Wonders or Changes will give you a random or a good mutation

- Xom will sometimes give you a bad, random or good mutation, depending on his mood

- Quaffing a potion of mutation will give you 3 random mutations

- Eating mutagenic chunks (from a sky beast, ugly thing, etc.) will give you a random mutation. Mutations granted by eating rotting mutagenic chunks are strongly weighted towards bad mutations.

- Jivya grants unique mutations available only to its followers

- Quaffing potions of Gain Str/Dex/Int (0.12) or Beneficial Mutation (trunk)

Some sources of bad mutations (avoid these):

- THE MALMUTATE SPELL - I list this one first and in caps since this is by far the most common. Neqoxecs, Cacodemons, Shining Eyes and Orbs of Fire all cast this. It requires line of sight, but it works at any range, and it ignores magic resistance. If you're going into the Slime Pits, the Abyss or Pandemonium, make sure to have some form of protection from mutation. Note that an amulet of resist mutation is still only 90% effective.

- Magical contamination (gained from miscasts, multiple castings of haste/invisibility in a row, Zot traps, etc.)

- Mutgenic attacks (from pulsating lumps and Mnoleg)

- Miscasting a high level transmutation spell sometimes gives bad mutations

- Mutagenic fog

But I find it disappointing, sometimes, that no player can ever share a particularly unique experience except by writing up a report or dumping a ttyrec or what have you. Sure, you could purposefully pass along scummed saves, but it isn't ""supported"" in any fashion and it's certainly not encouraged. As a consequence, not only is it non-trivial to share saves, it's very difficult to allow players to compare themselves on a perfectly ""equal"" playing field, excepting the degree to which every player can compete to be the most adaptable given the random conditions.

(As an, you can ""simulate"" endgame problems with, say, wizmode in several games; in Nethack, anyway, it would be entirely possible to create any given set of equipment, stats, XL, and DL through wizmode, along with any number of other situations. And, for some games, the seed of the dungeon can be manipulated, which will allow you to recreate the conditions by playing back the previous game's input. Both solutions are inconvenient, though.)

I'd love to see a roguelike that included the option for endgame problem studies. What if you could annotate certain turn numbers during the game that would only become accessible upon victory/ascension/whatever?  Or maybe, at the end of the game, the system would pop up with a few key moments that you could select from, like the game conditions when you first picked up the Amulet of Yendor. Or maybe it would exclusively work like New Game+, where it requires you to have beat that game yourself to play previous saves. I think you could avoid the sensation of save scumming if you made it a requirement to beat the game before having access to saves, maintaining the challenge of ""fresh"" seeds but allowing for an alternate style of playing the game. 

Admittedly, I have no idea what the technical limitations on this would be. I assume that, since the game has no problem saving the state of the dungeon in between plays, the save files aren't so cumbersome that additional ones could be stored. And because of the way roguelikes are procedurally generated, it's impossible to create the same conditions for very long, depending on how the RNG advances. But it would be fun to create endgame problems for expert players, whereby a particularly difficult or absurd situation could be shared to compare notes on how to approach the situation best, etc. 

Ugh, word vomit. **TL;DR**: Why not have endgame problem modes where players who won could use saves created during the session? Is this too much like save scumming? Would it even be possible? And would people even want it?"	t5_2rhpi	True

[Monster AI System Explained (Part 1 of 5)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1eavwx/monster_ai_system_explained_part_1_of_5/)

[Procedural Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)


All techniques demonstrated are implemented in my game **[TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)**, which is currently **[Kickstarting](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phidinh/tinykeep)** (only 10 days of funding left to go!)


Interactive demos for Parts 1, 1.1 &amp; Part 2 are at the usual place:

http://tinykeep.com/ai


**Part 1 Improvements**

Before I crack on with Part 2, I want to quickly mention some minor improvements I've made to Part 1 as a result of community feedback from Reddit and elsewhere. Thanks everyone for helping me improve on the AI so far!

[Part 1.1 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/YttkpNdS5bY)

In short, the changes are: 

1 . The co-ordinate of the last detected entity (either player character or breadcrumb) is saved as a variable every frame. So, while in Alert mode, if the Skeleton loses sight and smell of the target (all raycasts to the player character or dropped breadcrumbs return false), he will still continue to head towards this last detected location as its final target and re-evaluate from there. This is an improvement from the previous version where a monster would stop and go back to patrolling even though it has detected a target in the past - which is not expected behaviour.

2 . If the Skeleton still cannot detect anything from this point (all raycasts to the player and breadcrumbs again return false), Alert mode is dropped and the monster makes a ""best guess"" where the character is and sets the patrol waypoint target. For this initial version, the ""best guess"" is simply the nearest waypoint to the character at the time. If the character moves away after this point, the best guess waypoint remains the same. I admit it's a little bit cheaty of the AI - since it now knows exactly where the character is in order to set the waypoint - but it works well and looks realistic enough because of its slow movement during non-alert patrol mode. Most players won't know the difference, it just looks like the the monster is heading in the general direction and its likely the player has moved on from this point anyway. Still - for completeness I may modify best guess to take into account the target's last seen velocity and extrapolate from there.

Given these changes, we've removed the alert level (range 0-200 etc...) as we've found this feature has become redundant and offers no extra intelligence. It has simply been replaced with a boolean, so either alert or not. The ""smell trails"" have also been shortened significantly to balance out the extra added behaviours - with the last detected code there is no need to have such a long trail, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.

Let's move on to the fun stuff!


**TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense**

Today we'll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the ""Shy"" personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long, and he'll breathe fire on you, while still attempting to flee.

[Part 2 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c)

1 . For the demo, Fire Imps in non-alert mode stay in one position, although other Shy monsters may roam/patrol in the same way as Skeletons. The Fire Imp is constantly looking around for signs of danger - every approximate second or so the monster rotates between a random range of -270 to 270.

2 . Like the Skeletons, the Fire Imps employ line of sight, the FOV being slightly greater than the Skeletons due to it being prey and not predator. If a raycast to a threat returns true (threat being the player or aggressive monster), Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.

3 . While in Alert mode, if the player exceeds a certain distance threshold then the Fire Imp begins the flee. We use an inverse of the Seek Steering Behaviour, which creates the Flee Steering Behaviour. (Subtract the destination vector from the source vector, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp's max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.

4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, Fleeing comes with a greater risk of getting stuck on walls and sharp corners. Because it is being repelled by the player, the target destination could be anything - a wall, another monster etc.. We don't get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.

5 . Each monster has it's own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, if the Fire Imp is in Alert mode and is being chased around for a sustained period of time, it will begin to breathe fire at the player. This is simply a fire particle with a velocity towards the player at the time. Fire particles are short lived and decay after a second. If the Fire Imp is no longer being chased or comes off Alert mode, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.

And that's it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, give them surprised animations, make use of sounds and speech. It doesn't matter how intelligent the AI is, if the player isn't given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.

Wait, what's that last one?

You die and lose everything?

He was off to a great start, but on Lair:8 ran out of ammo and had no other skill to replace his slings @ 24 with. The re-qualification to Long Blades was extremely painful and protracted (no stones for a looong time) and he was expecting to die. Both Lair:8 and Orc:4 clearing had to be postponed because of low skill with swords. He had to continue exploring the Dungeon until he started getting ammo gifts from Okawaru again. Eventually, the game took off and he got on the track again. He was actually powerful enough to kill Xtahua and Mennas in tight sequence, appropriating the latter's eudemon blade that was his primary weapon from that point. Eventually, he collected 4 runes and was thinking about trying the Pandemonium, but that attempt was called off because of no way of resisting mutations and generally awful resistances. In Zot:5, the fighting was tough. Ancient liches were falling under eudemon sword blows left and right, but it was orbs of fire that caused the most woe, heavily mutating the halfling until he had acquired teleportitis. Quick search revealed that the only potion of cure mutation is stashed in Temple. The long run there and back again and fight resumes and again, mutations, mutations... this time no teleportitis, so he got the Orb and started to run. The most nerve-wracking moment of the whole game took place at its very end -- mere three tiles from the upstairs on D:1. The halfling was down to 26 HP and the hellion who has burnt him that badly was near him. It looked that he might die tantalizingly close to the victory. Fortunately, his stack of potions of heal wounds was sufficient to reach the stairs.

Mine was a bit lame:  
I had the 1st layout Rock ship, my main strategy was boarding. As weapons just 2 mediocre missiles (which run out really quickly, if you use them all the time). The usual mission went as shoot missile to medbay, board with 2 rocks, win.

Turns out the boss is weak against boarding (i had 6 crewmembers, 4 were rocks):  

Fight 1: Teleported first 2 rocks into the 3rd room (this one shoots missiles), then one rock into rooms 1 &amp; 2. These rooms are separated, so after destroyed, the ship will be just floating there, unable to attack - infact it cant hurt you if you just take out the 3rd missile room. After the rocks have finished smashing the weapon rooms, tele back, heal. Then hit their engines with missiles(to reduce their avoid chance to zero), until they had 3 HP left. After this one more missile into the medbay, and 3 rocks + a human guy ports in. Their main area has 7 crew, it was a fun fight. After everyone died, the AI takes over the ship...which will autorepair everything. Dont wanna wait for that, so i teleport out, and fire a final missile to finish him.

Fight 2:  
Now the ship has no crew, just an AI...which sounds worse than the crew, since it autorepairs everything, but actually this is his biggest flaw too. Plus i have no missiles left... I send one rock to the missile bay again, two to the droid room. the others stay at the ship to fight the assault droid for now. If the ship uses its special ability, i cloak, thus negating all damage. after a few seconds, the missile bay is down again, same for the droid bay, thus no more assault droids. And here shows the biggest weakness of the AI: As soon as it repairs a system, my rocks start to hit it again. If it gets destroyed the ship loses 1 HP...so its checkmate again. Since i have no missiles one of the rocks must stay on the ship to finish it... sadly he dies if the fight ends.

Fight 3:
After a repair (and getting 5 missiles) Same technique as before, send in rocks to smash things, if the AI repairs them, smash again. I needed those missiles to tear down the super shield, because it prevent teleport.

I liked this method, seemed pretty creative to me, but a bit lame too - basically one guy tearing down the entire rebel mothership while the others enjoy the show behind the shields."	t5_2rhpi	True

Pourush	24	1	36	" I'm interested in the complexity and difficulty in roguelikes, but I'm not willing to play through a boring early-game. Because of that and my tendency to not save a game I find uninteresting, I never see the mid-game, whether through failure or apathy.

 I don't really care about only seeing the beginning if it's interesting, but I haven't really found a roguelike I've liked. In the ones that I've played (Crawl, Nethack), there's a lot of time that passes between interesting decisions, my impatience for which could cause a discrepancy between my experience and the readers of this question. I can't comment on whether seeing the mid-game or late-game would make me more interested in the roguelikes I've played because I haven't ever seen them, which may also cause such a discrepancy.

 I'm not sure that there is a roguelike that would be interesting to me, so if the answer to my question is ""No"", or ""None that would be so for you"", I'll accept that.

Edit: I asked about a roguelike that was fun for noobs because I will be a noob at the game when I start. I think I'll be pretty much okay tutorial-wise as long as I can understand whatever screen I'm seeing.


Edit 2: I've actually played a few more roguelikes than I've mentioned. Below is a list of the roguelikes I've played for a nontrivial amount of time, along with a short description of why I played (if notable), and stopped playing. 

ADOM: All I remember is that I couldn't stand the setting of it as soon as I played it.
Desktop Dungeons: Couldn't find anything really that fun in it.
Crawl: Loved the focus on risk management and resource management, but otherwise not my cup of tea.

The Red Sonja dungeon sprint map: The only flaw I saw was that it got too repetitive when you played it multiple times with the same build due to you knowing exactly how to handle the point up to when you died. There might be some other reason that I didn't switch builds. Liked the discovery of how to handle the various rooms.
Dungeons of Dredmor: Alien to me in every way.
Nethack: Okay if I'm bored enough, but for more than that I'll have troubles with the pacing.
Dwarf Fortress: Complex in areas that aren't as interesting to me as complexity in, say, character builds and playstyles. Could be fun, but just not worth the effort it takes to learn how to play. 

Thanks to everybody who posted/will post a recommendation. I'm kinda new to this sort of thing, so I hope I'm doing whatever I'm doing right.


Edit 3: For better spacing. Didn't take.

Edit 4: I played a bit of Brogue. After I realized that the gameplay of this game represented a very basic form of what a roguelike was all about, I realized that I didn't really like the basic gameplay of a roguelike, whether it is easy or difficult. It's just that I happened to get confused because there were some aspects of some roguelikes that I really liked a lot. So, sorry for the confusion, and thanks for your help."	t5_2rhpi	True

Sil is an Angband variant featuring a massive overhaul of the Angband engine to make an authentic Tolkienian dungeon crawling experience. It's the best variant I've ever played, and is becoming one of my favorite roguelikes.

Do not be fooled that this is an Angband variant - the developers have gone to great lengths to make this game intuitive, balanced and non-repetitive, having cut out huge chunks of the original game, reworked user interaction, and consolidated redundant/pointless gameplay elements. The design philosophy is much like Crawl's, where everything has a purpose and nothing is wasted.

It has a great tutorial and an *excellent* manual that should be all you need to enjoy the game.

-The aforementioned autoexplore

-A health bar and color-coded status line and menus for low health, bad effects, cursed/blessed items, etc.

-Perform actions on an item directly from the inventory screen instead of backing out first.

-Automatically attempt to open doors when you move into them.

-Rebalancing of useless artifacts

-Color-based alchemy, so different potions are mixable every game

-Dungeon overview, keeps track of interesting features (ctrl+o to view) and lets you name levels (ctrl+n, unless you use hjklyubn movement), so you can remember them for later

*Procedural content generation is one thing, but what's hot these
days is player-generated content. How does it fit in roguelikes?*

Some time ago I heard someone propose a ""hardcore mode"" challenge for Minecraft: you only have one life, when you die, you have to delete
the savegame. Now this is something that works in roguelikes pretty
well... but would you really want to play Minecraft that way?

It seems that while in roguelikes you get pretty attached to your
character (and what he achieved), when you're allowed to build/create,
there is something more involved. Threatening not only several hours'
play but also effect of several hours' *creative work* - developing
something way more complex than player's stats and inventory - seems
too harsh.

Or maybe I underestimate RL player's masochism?

- Do you know examples of Minecraft/DF-style building gameplay in
roguelikes? Or any gameplay that involves creativity?

I wouldn't say exploring and leveling up is creative. Some games allow
for digging (I always dig up a little storage area for a stash in
ADOM) and placing doors. There are things like pudding farming in
Nethack which seem a bit more creative but not very fun.

Are there any more express examples in existing games?

- Do you think allowing player so much creative freedom (DF-style
skills, for example), combined with permadeath, would work?

One problem I see is that the game could become too much sandbox-like.
Maybe it could be possible to balance freedom with some of the usual
anti-farming measures - hunger/corruption/shortage of building
resources/doomsday clock/??? "	t5_2rhpi	True

Video with voiceover is the obvious way of doing this. But since that's a bit more work (and I'm not going to get the chance for a few days anyhow) I thought I'd see if anyone was interested in such a thing beforehand, and what elements they'd like to see in a video. 

For example: spending some time before starting a game talking about why MfVM is a good build, what sets it apart, what the flaws are, etc. Also, going over keys and interface features that new players might not realize exist. And anything else I might not think of besides general strategy, skills building, etc.

Can't be sure it will work out, I don't really want to upload several hours of video, just as I'm sure no one would want to watch anything that long, so I'll need to do a lot of editing.

I can remember a few and I'm hoping others can chime in with playing tactics that help bring them further into the dungeon.

1.) It's almost universally worth quaffing and reading every scroll you come across in very immediate beginning of the game to attempt to identify them without waiting for scrolls of identify or being able to cast the spell, but you should try to wait until you have unidentified and cursed equipment in your pocession before hand.  This way you'll be able to use scrolls of identify or scrolls of remove curse if you come across them.

2.) Sometimes it might be worth quaffing that potion of mutation you're sitting on.  While there are plenty of mutations that will affect you in a negative fashion you might luck out and get one of the beneficial one.  I always pick up and keep all my potions of mutation and will quaff one everytime I pick up a potion of remove mutation.

3.) Hill Orc Priests usually just need to make it to the Orc Mines to see a serious power upgrade.  Be sure to pray over all/any fallen Orcs for piety.  If you run out of Orc followers you can always try to return to the Mines later; I've had some luck with finding more Orcs even after I've cleared the whole thing out thousands of turns before.

I also want to take a look at ULarn once I've beaten Larn.

It's a pretty simple game for the most part, but it's pretty hard to get information on what the items and spells do.  I've been taking a look at the source, and it's nasty (for an object-oriented programmer, vintage 80's C is a terrible sight) but surprisingly readable.  Based on that, I'm thinking about creating a wiki for *Larn, in the vein of the NetHack and DCSS wikis which have been so helpful to me.  I don't particularly want to go to the trouble, however, if no one else is going to read it.  Is anyone interested in this?

5th win! Working on trying to win with every race. 

I always struggled with Trolls because of two things: mid-game creatures with ranged attacks and hydras. 

Even though trolls have lots of health and regenerate quickly, they have terrible AC and EV stats because of lack of access to armor and low dex. So I thought Chei might be a good choice to get EV up (yeah, I know, many of you hate her) because of the big dex boost. But that exacerbates the problem, doesn't it? As a troll, you should be as mobile as possible so you can escape when things get hairy, and Chei's slowdown of movement speed makes that difficult. So I thought, ""why not try a warper?""

Early access to blink is super helpful, especially when you can cast control teleport or find a ring of the same. And early access to portal projectile, combined with large rocks and high STR (thanks Chei), gives you Super Smite^TM . Adding a large shield makes you pretty durable.

You basically turn into a slow-moving smite machine. This eliminates the two aforementioned problems, as ranged threats and hydras get smote. Even if you round a corner to bump into a hydra, 2 or 3 large rocks is enough to kill it. And the high strength enables you to carry 10-18 large rocks. Run out of rocks? Troll-unarmed blending machine. Low on health? Teleport or blink away.

http://crawl.develz.org/morgues/0.10/shackes/morgue-shackes-20120513-142951.txt

The initial thought behind the build was to be a guy with a bardiche and a shield. How does that work? Condensation Shield and Divine Shield from TSO (Turns out they don't stack too well, I had 20 from CS and DS (with 0 Shield skill) added only 5 for a total of 25 SH). Also while I'm at it, Ozocubu's Armour (increased my AC from 19 to 32 in the end).

Mf was the logical choice because of good (great) aptitudes in Ice Magic an Polearms. Hunter is good for the earlygame imo, Sigmund dies to 2 or 3 javelins to the face. Also, I don't like to start the game as a Spellcaster.

So I got Polearms to 26 and waited for Okawaru to give me a good Bardiche. The best he could muster was +1/+2 of venom, I was reluctant to enchant it because i thought it could be better (and TSO wouldn't let me use it). But I had 2 rings of slaying, an armour of slaying (:D), and +Dam on boots and gloves, so I went through about everything like a breeze.

I left Oka as planned, when the whole dungeon was cleared, including all branches except for Zot and Crypt, which I was saving for TSO. I enchanted a bardiche of chopping instead, and made it holy shortly after Crypt.

Thanks to the items, I was able to take down all Pan lords I encountered, just had to be careful if fiends were around. At one point I decided I wanted to be able to do a zig, with the hopes of finding what I was lacking: a good ring with rF and a wand of healing. That meant I wanted to learn Ice Storm, with Ice Magic already at 27. So I trained Conjurations, I actually didn't know that I still hat 10% fail chance with both at 27 in my leather armour (I don't play many casters).

Went to a zig with a ring of wizardry, a staff of energy and a crystal ball of energy (but Evocations only around 12). So basically 3-4 ice storm until mana ran out, then melee the rest. Found my ring on level 11.

On level 13 I got banished by a draconian. (Possibly saved me from a stupid zig death ;)) I was also under penace for Ice storming unaware draconians. Should be more careful.

With the ring (rF++) I knew I could do Gehenna and handle Orbs of fire, so I didn't enter another zig, and just finished the game.

The moment closest to death was probably in Pan, when I opened a Pan Lord Vault, that is pretty much a big concave door, where about 5 fiends and a Pan Lord were waiting for me.

Shiren had melded a Bufu mod onto his weapon several floors before and had some Ark Dragon meat. ""aha!"", he thought, ""i'll just retaliate with the homing fire attack!"" he ate the meat and transformed into an Ark Dragon and aimed in the direction of the attack, only to hit an unseen Shopkeeper in the way, causing him to aggro and rush in. between the 50 hit point attacks from the distant Ark Dragon and the Shopkeeper's pummeling, Shiren succumbed to his wounds and collapsed. 

i should have reverted to human form so i could use some of my items (including 2 herbs of invicibility), but panicked and stupidly tried to run away from the 2x speed Shopkeeper.

1301146459.0	gbxg6	7DRL review: Magicko, the thinking gamer's Magicka. 	Prezombie	23	3	1	"[Download now.](http://www.fobbah.com/magicko.html) For any Java-enabled computer.

This is a game in the same vein as Kornel Kisielewicz's DoomRL and many other games which take a popular game, and adapt its mechanics into a roguelike. Sometimes the result is worse, sometimes better, and occationally something completely different.

For Magicko, I'd say whether the result is better or worse hinges on two things. If you've played Magicka, and whether you liked playing Magicka. 

If you're going into this game blind, you're going in without a tutorial, and have little chance of enjoying it. If you've at least played some of Magicka, you've got a fair understanding of how the spells go together.

Apparently paradoxically, If you didn't like Magicka, you're more likely to enjoy Magicko than someone who did like Magicka. While Magicka's combat is fast-paced and the story is rather amusing, Magicko limits how ""fast"" you can construct spells, turning the system from a desperate keymashing game into a thought out attack.

At the cost of this is nearly all the atmosphere, but of course, that's something a roguelike rarely has, and rarely needs.

Since like Magicka there's no leveling up, no items, and the dungeon is purely procedually generated, with no storyline or pregenerated obstacles, nothing's stopping a player from just figuring out an optimal attack, then diving. 

It's a rather short game, clearly more a proof of concept than a fully-fledged roguelike, but the concept has been proved, and shows that developers shouldn't be afraid to experiment in the fear that the result will be utterly broken, eg. Tome2's runecrafter.

Rather than rate it on some abstract scale, I'll say it's worth playing, and at least beating on the easiest difficulty, but I wasn't hooked enough to try again on a harder difficulty.

If you'd like more 7DRL reviews, say so, and also feel free to leave your own thoughts in the comments."	t5_2rhpi	True

This game, I just came back to it in my search for awesome Roguelikes.

It has a small community WHICH REDDIT CAN HELP TO MAKE LARGER, but it's tight-knit, and very helpful.

The game is based on finding your own plot of land, and trade skills, along with combat.

Care to make a masonry fisher who cooks a mean cake? Do it. Want to make a berserker with black magic who uses a scythe? Do it.

If you make a complete fighting character, you hunt monsters for treasure, and use the gold to buy your land, pay someone to build your house, etc.

If you're a pure crafting character, you can create just about anything you'd like - right down to the wood grain graphic of your home, and others pay you to build/craft things for them.

What was your favorite, most ridiculous death caused by the rng?

Mine just happened (which prompted this post). I was a level 12 troll monk of Trog and had up to this point annihilated everything in my path. I had just cleared the orc mines and decided to peek at floor 13 for some scattered loot or treasure. Immediately upon descending, a yellow wasp stings me, severely poisoning and slowing me (no poison resistance). I attempted to go back upstairs before things got nasty and it stung me again, paralyzing me. As I'm frozen, a wolf spider zombie, giant toad, and wyvern zombie amble out of nowhere and proceed to gang rape me while I am frozen.

A spore then floats by and explodes on the giant wasp and me, killing it and leaving me confused on top of being paralyzed and severely poisoned. Then, guess who? Maurice the thief waltzes over to my helpless, horribly poisoned troll in the middle of the zombie gangbang and STEALS ALL 4 OF MY GODDAMN POTIONS OF HEAL WOUNDS, turns invisible and presumably joins in on the rape. My paralysis finally wears off and I have 5 hp, am severely poisoned, confused, and lack any source of healing. I attempt to quaff a potion of healing (the poison would have murdered me next turn so I had no other options), and am killed immediately.

1374051511.0	1ih4dp	[DCSS] YAVP Lava Orc Skald - full breakdown inside	Mdnthrvst	25	4	6	"http://pastebin.com/1PYmAB90

I quit at 3 runes because of a complete and utter lack of rCorr and rMut anywhere at all, even with a treasure trove and a Bailey; I didn't want to waste my 3 CMut pots on gunning for TRJ (and as it so happened, each and every one of them proved clutch in Zot), and I'm not comfortable enough with LO to attempt extended, especially since the Forest spawned and not the Crypt, preventing risk-free max TSO piety.

Anyway, these are just some observations about Skalds and melee-oriented hybrids in general.

The Skald spellbook itself, with some minor supplements, is up there with Enchanters' in terms of its comprehensiveness - aside from RMsl I mainly used all of its spells through the entire run.

I was insanely lucky to find Minor Magic in the Lair, though my luck ran out with jewelry, armor and weapon artifacts. Everything sucked, and everything that didn't suck I couldn't use, apart from a decent longbow. RMsl is one of the best spells in the game and I would've been perforated by any number of Giants, Centaurs or Yaktaurs without it.

I made a significant waste of heal wounds charges in Vaults: 5, completely preventable, owing to hubris/laziness/overestimation of my pure melee capabilities, namely, charging into a confrontation without a full magic pool, which is always necessary on Skalds.

Ring of Magical Power never left my finger through the entire game; by the end I had 50 MP, more than sufficient for hybrids that ignore Conjuration.

Infusion is superior to Song of Slaying at low spellpower, but quickly becomes a detriment once Song of Shielding is online; they both rapidly drain magic and the slaying bonus of Infusion is negligible compared to the damage reduction of Shielding.

I don't understand why Spectral Weapon and Tumika's Dance are different spells. It's ridiculous. They're the exact same thing except one is incorporeal. That said, Spectral Weapon is better by a mile, and is also the best spell in the starter book.

Chargin' up Heroism/Slaying/Shroud/RMsl/Spectral/Shielding (along with Regen/Haste/Finesse during insanely tough situations) with a well-enchanted max-rank weapon more than makes up for a lack of pure melee AC/EV (I don't think Ozo's Armor works with LO temperature gain, and didn't find it in the first place, so whatever.)

Mennas doesn't Silence you 100% of the time and Spectral Weapon is the most important thing to cast during that window of time.

Fuck Mennas.

Can't stress this enough - never enter a fight without your buffs or without enough MP (20 or so) to quickly pull off your Super Saiyan charge-up as enemies approach.

Spam Regen after every tough fight once it's hungerless. Speeds up midgame healing tremendously.

LO high-temp reading prevention didn't bother me much - three or four times I noticed it, but by then I already had Tele wands. Of course, if you get into trouble earlier than you have Tele or Blink online, this may be a problem, but you do have free Swiftness and ambient fire AoE at high Tension. It seems like a fair trade, but of course your mileage may vary. 

I used Song of Shielding too much - it is expensive as hell and you *will* lose all of your MP from a single cast. This prevents emergency Regen or SCBlink during fights that go sideways. I should have used it as a last-resort instead of including it in my pre-fight lineup, perhaps switching in Phase Shift instead if I had found it earlier. Song of Shielding isn't very good for the same reasons as Infusion, basically - 30 magic is a far more versatile resource than a little bit of slaying or damage reduction.

Not a Skald thing in particular, but in general, leave ALL of your potions and scrolls at the entrance to Zot. When you clear Zot:4 and everything in Zot:5 *before* the Orb Chamber, run back and grab all of your shit. You will need it for the Orb Chamber, but Draconians will burn and freeze most of it if you carry it on your first way down.

Elemental Evokers need to be used carefully if you follow  Okawaru - spamming the half-dozen or so lamps and fans I'd collected in the Orb Chamber, the fire guys' flame trail overlapped the air guys and this ""ally betrayal"" incurred penance. Which would've been a bigger deal had I not had a full suite of Charms, but lacking Heroism for a bit was slightly stressful. Do be careful with those if you're an Oka worshipper.

Lacking rElec was the roughest part of Zot by far - a surprise Storm Dragon brought me to 17 health just before the Orb itself, and only a random Tele to safety saved my life. Even worse, an Elec golem in Zot:1 nearly killed me before a merciful Warper Abyssed me away to safety. Yes, you read that right. Everyone is so preoccupied by Orbs of Fire that they sort of ignore an almost bigger danger in the abundance of Electrical enemies in that place.

The Orb run was uneventful, as it always is. Pan lords never seem to have torment or hellfire for some reason, not that I'm asking for it.

1358626646.0	16w3k9	[DCSS] First win after a year, MiBE	brain_scratch	24	2	4	"[My morgue](http://pastebin.com/rACE9bdc)

So I've been reading this subreddit and playing DCSS for roughly a year now...  Only got past vaults 4-5x. I play a bit aggressively, apparently.

I got bored of playing Dark Souls last night, and fired up a few rounds of DCSS. After a few random class splats, this guy came out to a decent start. An early acquirement scroll got me an early tele wand, and things just picked up steam from there.

I made a huge mistake that nearly killed me on zot 5. i picked up a deck and out of habit, decided to draw-ID it. This landed me in a very hot spot.. a few more tele wands put me just outside the orb chamber, where by providence, things came at me only 1-2 at a time.

I was considering dropping Trog and grabbing TSO for some extra runes... but really wanted to just get a win under my belt. Next time!"	t5_2rhpi	True

On my current run, DEEE, I ran into an altar of Trog on D2; the type with a nearby book that Trog torches when you get close.  I added a travel exclusion instead of triggering the bookburning, and headed on. I figured I'd probably get Blink at some point if I didn't kick it on the next floor, and if you can pick up Blink, you might be able to throw in Apportation too.

Fast forward to the L7, where I finally find my book of Spatial Translations.  Chalk that one up as later rather than sooner, but hey-- since Phase Shift is already castable, no worries.  I memorize Apportation, Blinking, and Shroud.

As I learn Apportation, I remember that I wanted to steal a book from Trog.  I went running for D2, all aflutter with excitement.  What could possibly be in that rare book?

I gank it.  I read it.  It is indeed a rare book, a unique manual containing only a single spell... Apportation.

My face.  Imagine it just then.

So far, I'm finding coffee break RLs to be a lot of fun. Brogue and DoomRL have gotten most of my RL time.

That was before I played RLs or even really knew much about them, so I didn't give it much thought.

But now I'm wondering about what other ones there are. I'm interested in checking out RLs from pretty much any [home gaming] console, but a little more interested in the 8 and 16 bit systems.

1336454985.0	tciim	[DCSS] Week 52: Lairless	danharaj	21	1	8	"The challenge for this week seeks to shake up your game by removing a branch that is considered to be a central component of a standard 3 rune game. The only rule for this challenge is that you may not ever step foot in the lair of beasts. The implications are many.

First, and most importantly, you will not have a vital source of experience early in the game. You will have to lurch your way around the dungeons and make an early appearance in the orcish mines in order to compensate.

Second, and perhaps more interestingly, you will be denied access the two easiest runes (and slime but no one likes the slimy rune). In order to make up the difference and enter the realm of Zot you will need to acquire two runes of the extended endgame. It is recommended that you proceed with extreme caution, as the realms beyond the standard dungeon are fraught with danger.

Perhaps the two most straightforward runes to attain will be the Iron rune located in the City of Dis and the Abyssal rune found in the endless expanse of the Abyss. The Abyss is a boring place though, so perhaps you would like to test your mettle in another branch of hell, such as Tartarus. Those who follow Kikubagudgha will seek the Golden rune located in the Tomb of Horrors, as they will be protected in large part from torment symbols. Followers of the Shining One will, in any case, find their god's powers extremely useful.

The greatest trial will be surviving to that point. Without the experience of the Lair, your midgame will be more difficult. It is highly recommended that you follow a god who will carry you through this period. Trog and Makhleb have powerful summons that can help you overcome foes when you are outmatched. Lugonu can banish enemies beyond your means and Jiyva can slimify them into benign jellies. Yredelemnul is another powerful choice, and Kikubagudgha gives you an alternative third rune as well as undead servants and a powerful midgame weapon brand.

Good luck whatever choices you make. Certainly there are many approaches to choose from here. Creativity and good judgement will take you far!"	t5_2rhpi	True

You can play any race or class and worship any god and you can play in 0.10 or Trunk.  However, you may only train one skill at a time and you cannot stop training that skill until it reaches 27.  

This means that upon starting a game you must go to your skills menu with ""m"", select manual with ""/"", and you must turn off every skill but one.  You cannot turn on another skill until you max the original at 27.  You can only train that skill until it hits 27, where you must turn on another skill.  This goes on until you die or win.

I highly suggest OgBe, MiBe, or MfBe.  Non-Be ideas include SpVM, MfDK, TrDK, MuSu, or VpSu.  Melee oriented characters will probably want to go Weapons -&gt; Fighting -&gt; Armour/Dodge, while spriggan casters can do Spellcasting -&gt; &lt;Primary school&gt; -&gt; &lt;Secondary school&gt; -&gt; etc, and Summoners will just want Summoning -&gt; &lt;Anything&gt;.

Since roguelikes have permanent death,  I thought I'd list games that carry over progress after death. Realize that not all games I list will be roguelikes, but if there's permanent death and a good permanence system, I'm listing it in hopes that roguelikes players would appreciate games a little outside the genre. If I missed one, please help out since I love the idea so much and would like to try any new game with rewards like this.

**Most Roguelikes**- There's a good chance you'll run into a ghost of your former self that you must fight. Also your own knowledge of spoilers as you experience dumb deaths. 

**Shiren the Wanderer**- Quests that are completed open up the path to goodies, story, overall progress, and bonus dungeons. (probably my favorite use of permanence in roguelikes)

**Desktop Dungeons**- If you meet certain objectives you unlock new dungeons, enemies, and classes to play as.

**Dwarf Fortress** - Ruined fortresses are explorable in Adventure mode and also cataloged within the map.

[**Realm of the Mad God**](http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/)- Get new classes; accumulate ""fame"" which can be used for purchasing items. 

**Binding of Issac**- Getting achievements and beating the game multiple times unlocks new weapons to use.

edit:

**Diablo III**- (not sure this exists, but it should unless the devs are thick) Achievements that lead to custom banner logos for doing well in Hardcore mode.

1334932990.0	sjpeb	It's been awhile but, Wayward Alpha 1.2 is now out!	drath	24	2	31	"Play it here: http://www.unlok.ca/wayward/

Last release post on /r/roguelikes/: http://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/oplet/wayward_alpha_11_released/

Also, new to the release is the Wiki (if you need help/info): http://www.unlok.ca/wiki/wayward/

If you've never played/heard of it it before, to sum up the game:

Wayward is a browser-based, turn-based, graphical roguelike currently in alpha. It is currently supported and will work in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. In the game, there is a large focus on realism and survival. Because of these elements, most weapons, and items will need to be crafted by natural objects found around the terrain. Unlike traditional roguelikes, in Wayward there are no levels; however, you can gain different skills which increase your effectiveness for each of the individual skills. Stylistically, Wayward hearkens to a 16-bit aesthetic in graphics and in sound. Game mechanics wise, the game is similar to the Ultima series, more specifically, Ultima Online with inspiration from other roguelikes and roguelikelikes.

1280587249.0	cvugf	Thank you, /roguelikes, for introducing me to DCSS.	Milgwyn	24	3	38	"I'm a long time Angband veteran (although my characters almost never make it past CLvl 30; I'm cursed by an inability to stop playing past 2 AM, when my concentration wavers and I'm incapable of making good decisions) and occasional IVAN/ToME player. Anyways, Stone Soup is the solution to so many of my Angband complaints, and while Angband will still have a special place in my heart, thank you /roguelikes for showing me Stone Soup.

I've especially enjoyed how every monster is, in some ways, a player; they behave intelligently, and I think I've seen goblins steal items from the floor before attacking me. Also saw some unique monster use potions and wands. Blew my mind. The persistent dungeons are just the icing on the cake. And the skill progression makes me feel like I have options for my character, instead of being locked into my class skillset only.

The biggest improvement over Angband, however, is the removal of any semblance of an economy. It feels so liberating to be able to leave junk on the floor because you don't need it; I'm used to maxing out my inventory slots in Angband because of the profit potential. It just feels wonderful to see an item you can't use and be able to chuck it without care.

Anyways, sorry for the long windedness, but if you've got any amazing features of DCSS to highlight (besides the above, and the auto-explore/auto-equip that already has me spoiled...), or anything to thank the /roguelikes community for, or any complaints about Angband/DCSS, feel free to reply.

Thanks for reading. :)"	t5_2rhpi	True

**I'm happy to share with you the latest build of Dungeonmans, the Heroic Adventure Roguelike.**


[Latest version here](http://www.dungeonmans.com/?page_id=290)


It requires the XNA 4.0 Redistributable, [found here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27598)


Dungeonmans is a lighthearted 2D roguelike set in a persistent world of high adventure that grows and evolves as you play. Explore untamed wilds, delve the deepest dungeons, defeat terrible and remorseless monsters, and roll around in piles of shiny loot. Currently in Dungeonmans is available for Windows.


Combat in Dungeonmans is about tactics, positioning, and clever use of skills. Even melee fighters get lines, cones, dashes, and other area effect attacks that reward players who think ahead and seize opportunity. Hero development is free form as you can pick from a variety of Masteries to build exactly the character you want. Start with a base class to get your settled in, or just grab a handful of points and a backpack of loot and build a class yourself.


I've been putting out new builds around once a week, faster if something broken gets out. Game data comes in after every kill, and players can send their own feedback right from an in game window if they so choose.


Every Dungeonmans is a graduate from the Dungeonmans Academy, an ever growing bastion of learning and knowledge. As your hero adventures, you might find old artifacts, lost knowledge, or trophies ripped out of the toughest monsters. These items can be used to upgrade the Academy and provide you with bonuses to your existing character and future graduates as well! Each heroically slain Dungeonmans can add power and knowledge to the Academy, driving the player ever forward to victory!


I hope you download the game and give it a spin. If you like it, and think it is worth your time, [check out the Kickstarter and see if you feel like backing Dungeonmans](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/56637190/dungeonmans-the-heroic-adventure-roguelike).


I'd be happy to answer any questions about development, as well as take your glowing praise / withering critiques right here in the post. Thanks for your time!

1371412457.0	1ggyjy	[DCSS] Weekly Challenge #88: Good God, Man!	suddenlystarving	24	3	31	"Sorry about the late start to this challenge, I was off the grid for the last week or so.

For this week's challenge, I'd like to highlight (in my opinion) one of less popular gods: **Zin**.

***

**Rules:**

* Start with Zin, either by playing a Priest, or by taking Zin as your first god.
* You must collect all runes and finish the game with Zin. 
* You may switch to the TSO or Elyvilon temporarily, such as to have TSO to brand a holy weapon or Elyvilon to cure rotted hp.

The winner is the player with the highest score by next Sunday afternoon, I'll create another thread on Saturday to wrap things up.

***

Here's a highlight of Zin's features:

**Piety**: Zin takes a tithe of 10% of your gold and converts it to piety. This stops at max piety. Gold is somewhat hard to come by in the early game, but piety can be maxed by the end of Lair/Orc.

**Vitalisation** - Protects you from nearly every status effect except for slow. (sickness, nausea, poison, paralysis, confusion, petrification, rot, and stat drain) 

It also boosts all your STR, INT, and DEX by Invocations/3. Thats a maximum of +9 to all stats!

It also gives a small amount of nutrition, but won't go past Full. This can save a character who would otherwise starve.

This is Zin's best ability (in my opinion). Use it early and often, whenever you see anything that may inflict you with a bad status effect or you might need the boost to your stats. 

**Early uses**: Adders/Ants (Poison), Orc Wizards (Confuse), Wasps/Eyes (Paralysis), and most if not all Unique/Named mobs

Later it can also help deal with mummy curses, although they can still slow and torment you.

**[Recite](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zin#Recite)**: Inflicts status effects and/or damage to things that Zin doesn't like, depending on the scripture you read. It takes 3 turns to recite, during which you cannot take any other actions, or cancel it. Afterwards you are out of Breath, and must recover to use Recite again.

It's tricky to use, but at high invocations it can instantly kill demons and undead. I've used it to clear Hellion Island and help in Tomb:3.

**Mutation Protection**: Your percentage to resist mutations increases to 100% and grows with your Piety. Zin also has a one-time use ability to remove all of your mutations, good or bad.

**Imprison**: This ability surrounds a monster in a 3x3 silver walled prison for a number of turns. There must be empty space surrounding the monster to be able to create the walls. 

Use this to stop single threats from attacking with a larger group, or to run away from a single enemy. 

Best targets: Fiends, Orbs of Fire, Ancient Liches, Out of Depth monsters 

**[Sanctuary](http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Zin#Given_Abilities)**: One of the best panic buttons in the game. This creates a temporary halo around you which monsters run away from, and will not attack you. It has many other effects, such as casting holy word at demons and undead. 

You can not attack an enemy without dispelling the sanctuary, but you can use your consumables to heal up, or to escape from the battle. Oh, and you can also use Recite without breaking it.

**Hell-Effect Protection**: Your percentage to resist the effects of hell while exploring it's branches increases to 100% and grows with your Piety. This lets you rest and recover in branches where you typically have to move as quickly as possible to avoid all the terrible effects of the various hells.

***

Feel free to add more tips and tricks to this thread, Zin is definitely a tricky and complex god, but one of my favorites.

After trying to get a bunch of Skalds past the early game, I decided to try a different route and start as a Necromancer but train melee and use Regeneration and undeads as support. Things went kinda well, hit a wall during mid game where I had a hard time killing stuff because I refused to use up my pain brand before I found a demon whip... After that point everything progressed smoothly until I hit extended.

Having only gotten 5 runes before (DECj, died to Brimstone fiend in Gehenna) so I was really scared of all the Demon branches. But after getting banished to the abyss and finding out I could steamroll everything there, I decided to go extended.

Last rune was the icy one, and hardest one, too. After almost getting killed (twice!) by Antaeus I decided to Shatter my way around him, snatch the rune and get out of there.

Demonspawn mutations were a lot of fun, despite my followers being killed by my burning blood mutation..."	t5_2rhpi	True

HOPr	magic_harp	22	3	10	"After three f**king years of playing this game fairly religiously, terrible characters, terrible playing, late bleary-eyed YASD nights and at least 4 times where I said I'd quit this game forever, I finally got the damn Orb.

[Character](http://pastebin.com/YJMkiE4S)

Thanks to Ophanim, whose train necro for pain brand and equip orcs better advice in my post earlier this week really made all the difference.

Zot was fairly easy, except for the Orbs of Fire that made short work of my horde - never found any rMut the entire game, either. Not a single item. Only two cure mut pots in the whole dungeon. I started having second thoughts about Zot when I got at least 10 mutations from the first Orb I fought. The run back to the door was much easier than I expected, too.

Never looted Vault:5 because Mennas spawned and recalled right next to me while at ~50hp and I nope'd the fuck out, snuck back, snagged the rune and left. I started thinking near the end, when I was trashing mobs with ease, that I could have gone farther, but, as other redditors pointed out in my previous post, that most likely wasn't going to happen and should at least get my 1st win.

And damn, it feels good.

&gt;A TAS of Nethack. Before you ask: no, I have no idea what's going on. Here's ais523's post about this movie:

&gt;----

&gt;What I've done since the last one is to get hold of a magic lamp (used) and a magic marker (not yet used, and left pretty much where I found it), fixed god anger using a dead shopkeeper, started training detect monsters (so you all can see what's going on), then went back to the Valley, then to the top level of the Wizard of Yendor's tower, to gain the levels required for the Quest unlock. (It turns out there was no nearby seed that let us bring all five wraiths down nearby, so we get four of them, and one of them gets away. We might nab it later, or gain the 14th level via polyself rather than wraith; there are plenty of options.) We've saved prior to the first actual sequence break in the game (as opposed to ""intended"" routes through the game which are far too risky to do without, at the least, strategies designed specifically to survive them; the route through the Castle that we've taken so far can actually be done in realtime, but only with around a 1% success chance based on Maud's records). What I'm going to try to do is use the master mind flayer's ranged attack, which doesn't require line of sight (unlike pretty much every attack in the game), to wake the Wizard of Yendor from outside his tower, then rely on the cheating AI to take him through the nearby impenetrable wall to fight us. (This can be done in realtime, but it's a bit random; I'll see if I can figure out how to do it quickly.)"	t5_2rhpi	True

1364107039.0	1awjj2	[COQ] Favorite Caves of Qud starting build?	Terkala	20	0	11	"Personally, I prefer gunners. The mid and late game guns are quite good, and it seems to me that while big hulking brutes are great for the early game, they tend to fall off in the midgame.

Start with: 24 agility, 18 intelligence, everything remaining in toughness. Take the mutations of ""hightened speed"" and ""Triple jointed"", with the remaining points spent on one more thing of your chosing (multi-legged is a great choice, and so is phasing, but its up to you). As for starting path, the pistol path is good, but so is the tinkerer path for starting with some basic crafting skills.

As you level, invest points equally into triple jointed and hightened speed, and equip any items that increase your dodge-value. The acrobatics skill of ""spry"" is essential as well. If you get your dodge value up high enough, enemies won't be hitting you much. And with Triple Jointed you'll be raising your agility (which raises your dodge value and ranged accuracy) as well as giving a flat percentage-chance-to-dodge all attacks. 

End result: The enemy will only be hitting you on natural 20s, and even then he'll miss 50% of his attacks. And you'll have an ungodly good accuracy with ranged weapons, and act about 20% faster than everyone else.

Let's hear your builds. I'd love to see some mental-mutations based builds.

1360719696.0	18ezeu	RogueShell - Roguelikes just became a lot more portable. (Free invite codes inside)	HumbleVermin	31	9	28	"Hey guys,

For those of you who didn't see the creator's original thread or missed the invites well I've got a surprise and for those of you who didn't even hear about it stay tuned.

 I’ve recently come into some luck and got an invite to this thing called RogueShell. It’s a pretty innovative program for those of you who are rather inclined to playing roguelikes.

 It allows you to play a variety of games (Nethack, Rogue, Crawl, ToME, and others) within a browser just by logging in saving you the trouble of downloading some of your favorite games, and keeps your session stored so that you can log in on any other computer and access your session and continue.

 It is still very much so in Beta, and it is a one man project, but there are a lot of features in the works. Currently you can spectate other users’ game session without chat, but it is a planned feature. He is very open to comments and suggestions to help build this project.
 Eventually there is going to be a fee, but not until the designer feels that it is a fit product to be sold. For now I have some good news though. For a temporary time he is currently giving out a limited amount of accounts that will have a lifetime free registration and has given me some of these codes to distribute. 

Do keep in mind that this is not a finished product, but a project in works and those of you who receive the accounts are asked only that you help the RogueShell by reporting any bugs or glitches you may experience. Go ahead and check it out, and you don’t have to have an account to spectate games so that you can pick up on some more experienced players’ sessions to help your own progression.
The developer is a really bro tier guy who had the registrations closed at first, but gave me one because I took the time to email him. Now that things are expanding a bit more he and I have been talking and he just needs help with exposure.

r/roguelikes, your challenge this week is to roll up a necromancer and make some friends. Undead friends. See, your necromancer is scared to death of fighting alone. Bolster your confidence with an army of the undead! 

Rules: Play normally, but you are only permitted to kill until you find a humanoid corpse. At this point, you must rely on using your undead slave to make kills for you. 

Make it as far as you can, you gothy deathmonger!

**Highlights:**
I started with good stats and enough talents to get my Heir gift (adamantium dagger of penetration) which kicked loads of ass and definitely helped get me out of the early game. Seriously, this thing is one of the best heir gifts.

I got very lucky and was able to pacify the Big Room super early, which let me abuse the hell out of herbs. Went into the mid game with stellar stats.

Got stuck for a long time with no Amulet of Lifesaving for Khelevaster. But (again) finally got lucky with a blessed potion of exchange and a stack of 8 rings of something. Nothing smells like victory like a stack of 8 blessed rings of djinni summoning. I used the wishes on seven league boots, AoL, girdle of giant strength, PoGA's, etc. This is why I never, ever sell or drop rings. Just let them pile up.

I cleared a Greater Karmic Vault, which was fucking harrowing, also a Ghost King tension room that almost aged me to death, but with all those wishes it was a pretty straightforward run. Pretty satisfying, I'd been working on this character for a few months.

Also, I don't know if anyone else does this, but I always create a notepad file for each of my characters that last longer than a few turns. It helps me keep track of where important things are (herbs, altars, cats, etc.). I find it super helpful. Here's my notes for Sam. Things in parenthesis are stuff that are no longer a threat.

My first ever ascension, and with a MiFi that in the early levels I thought wouldn't make it past D:8 thanks to some bad uniques.

Orbs of Fire weren't really a huge prob with rF++ to me it seemed. Once I hit Zot I just booked it to Zot:5 rather than mess around and get something bad to destroy me.

In the end, I feel mentally exhausted and oh so damn happy. 

Here's hoping to many more ascensions! (Oh, and if anyone wants to tell me where I did something possibly wrong, feel free, always down to learn new things.)

I was next to a barrel.  Barrel exploded, and with knockback, I remained in the resulting lava spill.  Died instantly.

This is the first roguelike I've played more than a half dozen times before getting bored and giving up, so I'm definitely a noob.  But I have about 48 hours into DoomRL, and it's getting pretty frustrating that I've only even made it to the Cyberdemon twice.  This death was pretty frustrating to say the least.  I still love the game though.  Heck, I already want to start developing my own roguelike for fun.

**Naga**

First up, the slow and sturdy race. Until recently, I haven't played much of these, but after I had a good run with a Naga Warper, I like them more than I thought I would.  Lots of HP, decent defenses, and low shield penalty make the speed thing less of an issue. Constriction has been added in 0.10, and it helps quite a bit early on.  Naga make good hybrid characters, since they need a way to fight stuff they can't run away from.

**Felid**

Second, fast and frail. I hadn't played much of these either, but I recently splatted a FeSu in Zot:5, and I had fun doing it.  Not being able to use anything except scrolls, potions and jewellery makes things interesting.  Nemelex would be a good god since Felids can't use 95% of the stuff on the floor, but can use decks.

1326095418.0	o92cw	[DCSS] YAFVP: DeWz of Veh	indspenceable	22	4	10	"First win! Ah! Generally, the character went smoothly - spent the early game mostly spamming Call Imp, with some Meph support. Eventually this stopped being effective, when monster stopped staying confused for long enough to deal with. Someone posted that going Conjuror with Veh is like easy mode, and I have to agree - Bolt of Fire + Bolt of Ice + Freezing cloud -&gt; ice storm makes the game feel much easier. This was my frist time in the slime pits, which I had decided were the scariest thing ever and was pleasantly surprised that they aren't actually too crazy.

A couple of tricky things: first, Mennas wandering around a level was terrifying - I've had bad experiences with him in the past, and this character was completely disabled by silence. Never got deflect missiles, so I had to stick with repel unless i had time to switch to the rod of warding. My biggest issue of the game was MUT, though. I found my first potion of Cure Mut on Vault 3; I found another 2 on Zot 4. No rMut equipment. In slime, I managed to get stuck with the anger mutation; I had to use clarity in zot. Got ambushed by an orb of fire &amp; an archlich without mana, and got loaded with mutations, but somehow managed to be alright, after retreating and using up all my curemuts.

I think it took me a lot longer than the average player; I started  crawl (playing on+off) four years ago. It's pretty cool to finally win a game!

So anyway, I'm standing near some water, and I quaff it. Potion of Gain Strength. Sweet. I'm feeling good, I'll try the scrolls. First one is Detect Magic, awesome. My pack shows positive enchantments on everything else I have, which is one more scroll and a wand. This is great. The next scroll is a Scroll of Enchantment. *No way*, I think as I apply the enchantment to the wand. I feel like I wasted it a bit by giving an unknown wand one more measly charge, but I'm still too happy and impressed by IDing so much useful stuff so early on. 

Just then, a jackal comes through the door. I figure *what the hell*, and hit the jackal with a bolt from the wand. The jackal suddenly changes into a spider. Shit! The spider immediately webs me. I shoot the wand again. The spider becomes a kraken. Double shit! I blast it with the wand one more time. It disappears.

----

I'm tinkering on a roguelike game at the moment, and I'm working on a crafting system for it.  I have a few ways I could go with it, and thought I'd ask and see what others thought.

The crafting system will involve finding the raw ingredients for making objects, and then going to a ""crafting"" interface where you can break down and combine objects to create new objects.  Crafting is going to be pretty central to success in the game.  But how does the player know the ""recipes"" for breaking down and combining?

**Option One** is to have a crafting system where you start the game knowing all the things you can craft, the ingredients they take, etc.  The player has perfect knowledge of what he can create, how to create it, and what he needs to find to create what he wants.  The focus is on strategic crafting.

**Option Two** is to have a ""discoverable"" crafting system, where you happen upon ingredients for craftable items, and you have to experiment to see if they can be put together or torn apart.  The focus is on simulated invention.

On one hand, I like the idea of discoverable crafting.  It adds mystery and a sense of accomplishment when you discover a new recipe.  It also adds fuel for a community to grow around the project as people post and share ""recipes"" they discover.

On the other hand, while I'm going to try to have the crafting system have an inner logic to it, I don't want people frustrated with having to play ""guess what was on the game designer's mind"" in order to succeed.  And this approach also seems like it would be more prone to ""I think these should go together, but they don't!"" sorts of situations.

So, I started brainstorming ideas that might mitigate the problems of both approaches.

**Option Three** is a hybrid of the two, with a large library of ""known"" recipes at the start of the game, with several reserved recipes that you have to discover on your own.  I'm not entirely convinced that this isn't the worst of both worlds.

**Option Four** is an on-the-fly listing of craftable items based on items you have.  This would tell you what you can craft *at any given time*, but you still might have to experiment with bringing together different ingredients to discover new recipes.

**Option Five** would be to list, as part of the description of each item, what items can be crafted from it, but not the entire recipe.  This would allow things that can be craftable to be discoverable, but you still might need to get creative and/or lucky to get all ingredients.  This would also, I imagine, involve a lot of cross-referencing, which might be a dull proposition.

A sixth option, ""buy recipes from NPC's or earn them as treasure"", is possible, but I don't really like it because is not really conducive to the setting.  However, I'm open to advocacy for it, since it's possible to contrive anything (""You just had an idea for making an axe!"").

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

It might sound odd, but I've never had such an adrenaline rush from a game like running Zot:5 for the Orb in Crawl or grabbing the Amulet of Yendor in Nethack, fighting my way up through the Elemental planes and then slashing through the Astral plane to find the right altar.

Those are 2 examples of some very intense roguelike endgames that I've gotten a ton of enjoyment out of. On that note, a lot of Nethack/Crawl can be pretty intense in places. I really like that a lot.

ADOM is another one that leads to some intense situations, but I haven't played it in a very long time and I never did get to the end. There's something about running through the Tower of Eternal Flames that is weirdly adrenaline-pumping to me. I'd like to get back into ADOM, but I'll probably wait until the current dev cycle is complete before doing that.

So we're looking to expand our ranks to include a lot more people from the roguelike community to help review all of the 7DRLs made this year.  What we're looking for:

- Experienced roguelike players or developers, especially those with good knowledge of 7DRLs
- You must be willing to spend at least an hour a game on at least 10 games, chosen at random, that may be shite or buggy or hard to get running with poor instructions etc
- You must give objective ratings from 1-3 on 6 areas (see http://www.roguetemple.com/7drl/2012/ for examples) with short written justifications for each
- Write an overall description of the game, that is both informative for players and constructive for the developers
- A RogueTemple account so you can join in lively discussion on the private subforum

This challenge will end Monday, January 21st at 12:01 AM

As someone mentioned previously, if you go Chaos Knight (OpCK) you can sometimes get quick levels in the Abyss by poking a monster repeatedly with a trident from deep water.  This may make your early game easier.  Otherwise, Octopi do well with magic (avoiding direct combat due to no armor) and have pretty good stealth ability.  You can try to abuse Fedhas to create deep water but they're not as good as merfolk in this regard so it is probably a waste.  

I always wished that constriction could be better but sadly most later monsters are too big and it doesn't seem good for much other than keeping crimson imps from running around and getting rid of plants faster.  Still, once released, the Kraken cannot be stopped.  It can only be killed by a marauding pack of gnolls and turned into overcooked calamari."	t5_2rhpi	True

Hi everyone, lengthy post ahead!

So this is my first time posting in roguelikes (much less anywhere else on Reddit). I'd played nethack and ADOM a bit before and really liked them even though i was never quite good with them so i decided to give DCSS a try after seeing all the posts here. I have to say that i was very, pleasantly surprised.

So first my thoughts about the interace. I decided to try the tiled version because the tiles look pretty good to me actually, not like poop in other roguelikes. I've tried tilesets for nethack before but they never really did it for me. The tiled interface in DCSS is AMAZING! i love the hover tooltips and being able to click for commands that i had yet to figure out the hotkeys for! it really made getting started with the game so much easier. Also the in-game help is so well layed out. It made it really easy to jump in the game with just my limited experience with other roguelikes. And don't even get me started on all the travel options! Auto-explore is an amazing feature and i bet if i hadnt been using it i wouldnt have gotten so far with my first game.

Now about my first game so far. I made my first character and jumped right in, ignoring the tutorial option at the main menu. I made a Deep Dwarf Fighter because i'd heard they were easy characters for a beginner. I played through a bit and the first problem i ran into was the lack of natural regen on my character. I'm guessing it's a racial trait? Luckily, i assume as another racial trait, my guy started with a wand of heal wounds. Another stroke of luck that i didnt really appreciate til later was finding a shrine to Elyvilon and becoming her worshipper. Being able to rejuice my wands has been a lifesaver! And my third stroke of luck was finding a wand of disintegration early on. I feel like i've actually gotten pretty far for my first playthrough. I managed to disintegrate Sigmund (a famous name i hear thrown around who seems to be the bane of beginning adventurers), some named slaver guy, and Prince Ribbit. I've just been going down through the dungeon killing enemies, finding loot, and now i'm at Dungeon Lvl 8 and my fighter is lvl 10 and he's still alive!... for now haha. I'm sure hard times are ahead though because i've permanently used up all my mana recharging my wand of healing as its been my only source of healing, as well as a recharge or two of my wand of disintegration.

So, my story is probably not impressive for veteran players, but it's still my first game and after 3 hours of play i'm still alive so i felt like bragging a little. If you managed to stick around and read up until this point then thanks a lot and hopefully i'll get in on the discussions more in this amazing subreddit! Good night for now!

Here's to hoping we put up a stronger showing this week, lets see some wins!

EDIT:  The Slash'EM challenge works as a tie breaker.  If two people ascend in crawl, and one of them ascends in Slash'EM as well, the second player wins.  Crawl score is third tie breaker if multiple people ascend in both, or nobody ascends in slash'em (more likely ;-))"	t5_2rhpi	True

* **DE, Mu, or Vp of Trog:** These are probably the three worst races for the Berserker god.  DE wastes pretty much all of their good aptitudes, although they do still have good Dodging and passable Short Blades, Long Blades, and Staves.  Worse though is their low HP - but taking up archery is an option, especially since Trog gifts ammo.  Mu of Trog is obvious: no berserk, bad apts all around, no healing options (which Troggies need much more than casters).  Vp of Trog is a strange one to play: you can go berserk, but it's very dicey: you frequently fall out of berserk as soon as you trigger it, having done nothing but slowing yourself.  Also their apts and skills are hardly suited for a berserker.  I'm not including Gh of Trog here because, despite the lack of berserk, that one's actually pretty easy: lots of HP, Trog's hand helping with regeneration, good UC and Fighting apts, and BiA more than make up for that lack.
Note that for this choice, you don't have to start a berserker if you don't want to, but you must pick up Trog at the first altar you find if you don't.  No DENe for the whole game who picks up Trog on the Orb run!  But style points awarded to anyone who ascends a DEWz of Trog.

* **Fedhas:** The plant god!  Not a bad god by any means, but his abilities are kind of scattered, and require a lot of food and Invocations investment.  They are each useful in their own way, although some more than others.  I leave it to you to figure out what species work best with him; for this god, he must be the only one you worship, and you must pick him up as soon as you find his altar.

* **Jiyva:** Slime for the Slime God!  A number of strange but useful abilities.  In this case, you can worship another god before Jiyva, since otherwise you'd have to startscum for an early altar or play atheist for a while.  However, as soon as you're able to survive the trip to Slime:6 or your current god's wrath, you must switch and stay."	t5_2rhpi	True
