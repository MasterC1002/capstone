With newly-minted PhDs and completed postdocs in the market, I thought it would be good to compile a list of great resources for finding faculty job listings.  

There are a lot of niches that different sources might focus on:

* Location:  United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, Central/South America, Africa, or regions within those categories.
* Type of school:  Research university, liberal arts college, community college, etc.
* Specialization:  Natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, arts, professional (e.g., medicine, law), narrower categories within these, etc.

For listings throughout the spectrum but with a focus on institutions in the U.S., my go-to pages are [Chronicle of Higher Education](http://chronicle.com/section/Jobs/61/) and [Higher Ed Jobs](http://www.higheredjobs.com/).

So, what resources do you recommend?

First of all, I just want to say thanks to all that make this a great subreddit. I find articles and discussions that I would not run across otherwise and they are always interesting to read.

I am currently at a state university in the United States studying higher education. I am scheduled to graduate in the spring of 2014 with a Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration. I have a graduate assistantship at the university where I am a student.


My main interests when it comes to careers in higher education are in institutional research and financial aid. As an undergraduate, I fell in love with research and I feel that if I were to work in IR I would be doing something I love. A job has just opened as an IR analyst at the university where I am a student and I am torn as to whether I should apply. On one hand, it is an opportunity at an institution where I would love to work and it is a good entry-level job in IR. Further, I want to stay in this city and I am not sure if there will be any opportunities available in IR when I graduate (the other offices at institutions in this city are small). On the other hand, I would have to leave the office for which I work as a graduate assistant (my supervisor said that he would not prefer that I leave but would support me if I chose to do so) and I would still have to go to school while having a full-time job. I am scheduled to graduate if I take 9 hours in the fall (3 classes) and 6 hours in the spring (2 classes, one being associated with an internship that requires 150 hours of work for the semester). Needless to say, it would be a tough year but I am confident that I would be able to attend graduate school full-time and work a full-time job.

Do you all have any advice for me or know anyone that has been in a similar situation (i.e., full-time grad school and full-time job)? Thank you very much."	t5_2r04r	True

Last week marked both a mass stabbing at Lone Star College (Texas, the second attack on a Lone Star campus since January) and a shooting at New River Community College (Virginia).  The truth is, I sit down to write this post every time I hear about senseless violence on a college campus.  I never post them.  Life always gets in the way.

Now we have seen at least five campuses disrupted by the threat of violence in the past two weeks.  Enough is enough.  I'd like to use this thread, and this community, to organize prevention and response resources for anyone involved in higher education.  We cannot stand in for a counselor after tragedy has struck.  Nothing posted on the internet will stop a bullet once it's been fired.  But we can work together to help prevent another tragedy and to help people deal with the burden of responding to one that could not be avoided.  We all have knowledge, wisdom and resources that should be shared.  We can make a difference.

Please post articles, comments, and anything in between that people can draw on to prevent or respond to violence on campus."	t5_2r04r	True

1374156481.0	1ik51y	A little sliver of what cost cutting compliance looks like when state legislators get involved.	UniversityofBrouhaha	12	2	1	"[ Throwaway account for several reasons. ] 

I have read several threads on reddit about college costs, and the bloat of college administration.  There are a number of causes behind problems like this.  I wanted to share something with you from my home state of Michigan.  It doesn’t explain away college costs or college administration, but it is a little window into the kinds of the things that universities have to deal with.

This summer, just like every summer, the Michigan legislature passed the higher ed budget along with an array of requirements that universities must fulfill to get their state support.  Some of these requirements are actions (like tuition restraint) or policies (like not offering benefits to unmarried partners) or reports (like telling the legislature how the money is spent).

This summer, the legislature has added a requirement designed to address the high costs of textbooks.  “YES!” You say, you who have recently bought college textbooks and felt like you’d been thoroughly rogered.  “It’s about damned time, this is awesome.”   

What did the legislature do?  It mandated a textbook review process.

According to Section 262a of Public Act 60 (that’s the appropriations bill), all universities shall develop policies for reviewing textbooks.  I’m going to set aside the concept of non-interference with faculty responsibility for pedagogy and content.  That’s an entirely different (albeit important) discussion.  I’m going to focus on what it means for costs savings.

So what does this look like?

First of, the legislature says that faculty members must submit lists of required textbooks and course materials for university review.   Okay.  Let’s say you are at Grand Valley State.  In a year there are 3,000 courses offered to undergrads (we’re going to assume that the legislature is most concerned about undergraduate books; the number would be higher if ALL courses were reviewed).  At Central Michigan, we’re talking over 2,500 courses.  Western offers almost 2,900.  U of M offers 3,400.  So we’re not talking about some small task here.

Admittedly, not all of those courses will require books or course materials; for example, musical performance, studio art, and similar courses often don’t require them.  However, some courses will require more than one text.  We’re talking about thousands of books and other materials.

So someone, or some office of someones, is going to have to “review” submissions for 3,000 courses.  That’s some staff time right there.  It’s going to take time to develop the process and communicate this to faculty, too, before the review task even begins.  Where do those people come from, and what work will they be setting aside to do this?  Whether or not this concerns you probably depends on whether you believe, as many do, that there are dozens of staff on campus with their feet up doing nothing. 

Now, how does someone “review” books?  Well, according to the legislature, there are several things involved in that.  One of them is that the university ensures the least expensive edition of a textbook available is chosen, when educational content is comparable to a more costly edition.  That probably means a couple of things.  First, they need to determine availability.  There have to be enough editions of an old version in circulation to ensure that students can get their hands on them and that they'll really be cheaper than the new version.  That’s probably not a huge deal; surely this is something that textbook dealers to on a regular basis.  However, making that check for hundreds of textbooks will take a non-trivial amount of time and effort.

More daunting is the task of determining that the content is “comparable.”  What does that process look like?  Going through two versions of the textbook, page by page, noting all the differences, and figuring out whether the difference is meaningful?  So who do they consult when a pharmacology textbook changes its information about side effects to commonly prescribed medications?  “Hey Joe, the 10th edition notes that anemia can occur when this class of drugs is taken with certain anti-inflammatory drugs, but the 9th edition doesn’t mention this.  Anemia is a big deal, right?  So the 10th edition is probably necessary?  No?  What about cardiac arrhythmia?”  Are these the kind of conversations the Michigan Legislature wants your university administration to be having?  Or will they have faculty do this part?  Won't you have to review that process to make sure faculty aren't just rubber-stamping their colleagues' choices?

Here’s the other thing:  This process has to happen quickly.  The University of Michigan studied textbook costs a few years ago, and they determined that one of the best ways to keep costs down for students was to get book info out EARLY.  

This is helpful for many reasons.  First, it lets area book retailers get out there and get as many used copies from distributors as possible, so more students have the choice to buy used if they want.  And if it happens early enough, it also lets them know about their own resale possibilities, so they can offer better buyback prices to current students (they can store the books themselves for resale the next term, instead of selling them back to the distributor).  Also, it gives student- and university-coordinated book sales/exchanges programs time to be updated and for students to use them.  It also gives students more time to track down other textbook resources on the internet, if they choose, because there’s selection and there is ample time for shipping.  

I don’t know how long these kinds of required book reviews are going to take, but you don’t review thousands of textbooks in a week.  It’s inevitable that they are going to slow down the process.  Bookstores will be notified later and the market for used books will be more competitive/constrained.  Students may not have enough time to order books online, or will have less availability.   Book swap programs will be under a time crunch too.  

Initiatives like this drive up costs and gobble up administrator (and faculty) time.  This probably sounded really progressive to someone in our state legislature.  Finally, someone is going to rein in those spendthrift profs who assigned pricey books!  They have signed this into law now.  All fifteen public universities in the State will be either be putting in review boards and a review process to comply with this, or they will be investing staff time in trying to explain to legislators why they didn't.  

This is not the only requirement in Public Act 60, of course.  Nor is it the first thing like this that Michigan universities have had to sort out.  The public awareness of these kinds of requirements, and their unintended consequence, is generally pretty slim.

I'm looking for first-hand accounts of what this means in practice. How do you divide your time? Is the research really free once you have an employer? How is the relationship with your advisor? Don't you think the flexibility you'd get by being a student is a good thing?

Also, I'd appreciate if anyone has links or articles about how this affected the science done in the Netherlands. Overall, was this a good or a bad move from the government's perspective?

Anyway, anyone's opinion is welcome in this discussion of whether science and scientists are better served by having PhD candidates be students or employees."	t5_2r04r	True

I have a little money set aside for some tech devices (and software) I've been lusting after, but I really want to use it to make an impact.

What I'm looking for is a tool that I can use to write on as I lecture ONLINE in a format such as Adobe Connect.  (I.E. students meet online at a predetermined time, I have a screen that I can write on as I talk to them over the webcam.)

Our campus uses Canvas, which has a link for a Big Blue Button meeting, but it's clunky to try and write and draw with the mouse.

I have heard that tablet PCs (laptops) are really the most sensitive while still allowing a person to see (on the PC) what they are actually writing - but this was in the context of somebody using it in a face to face lecture.  And, tablet laptops are the most expensive option ($1200 ++)

Tablets (like an ipad) are a cheaper alternative, but I understand they really lack sensitivity, and again this was only in the context of hooking it up to a projector with a VGA cable in a face to face class - I don't know if it's possible for me to plug it into a computer and use it as a WACOM substitute (but that would be awesome!  Am I missing something and is this possible?)

A WACOM tablet seems to be the cheapest option that would definitely work for my PC at home with an online class; but from what I understand, it's difficult to use because if you remove your pen from the tablet, you have lost your sense of reference, as the tablet does not have its own display screen.  Thus it would be difficult to go back later and add superscripts/subscripts to an existing equation, for instance.

Keep in mind that all the above information is what I have from hear-say from other professors and IT salespeople.  I could be wrong, if so, that's the information I'm looking for.  Which of the above tools (if any!) would be best for what I'm trying to accomplish?"	t5_2r04r	True

Seeing that there is a wide variety of higher education and higher education related professionals and students, I felt that there could be an opportunity to talk about many different hot issues in the field.

One issue that is very pertinent is the role of non-classroom, non-experiential based learning.  That is, the growing number of students who take coursework from accredited universities (For-profit and Non-profit) in hopes of reaching their goal of graduation and/or work.

Some of the challenges that play out with these types of teaching and learning models include persistence (the number of students who drop out of MOOCs, for example, is extremely high).  Second, there is a large number of professionals, specifically faculty, that do not place a lot of value into the learning that occurs in some of the for-profit models.  Third, these types of courses are being made more and more necessary (or at least, that's what we're being told) but there isn't any remarkable success in the delivery of these courses.

Feel free to take this discussion in any way that you feel is necessary.  I'm hoping that everyone in /r/highereducation can, at the very least, provide an opinion of the topic at hand and perhaps address some of the issues that I've provided.  For what it's worth, I'm coming from a student affairs perspective and so persistence is a big concern for me.

99% of all grants to higher education are based on research. 

A professor's success is defined by research. Research output determines whether they can travel for work, be of interest to their peers, get any power that matters in professional organizations, and make more money.

So, what incentives do professors have for being better teachers?
I'm a professor. I think I know the answer. I'm curious to know what others think."	t5_2r04r	True

- Stumbled through first two years of college studying computer programming
- Took a year off
- Changed major a couple times
- Graduated 3 weeks ago with **Bachelor's Degree in Journalism: Mass Media**
- Think my degree is worthless and want something better while I still can
- Considering additional education focusing on technology (possibly computer networking?)
- Looked at Phoenix University (expensive) and ITT Tech (which, quite frankly, terrifies me based on what I've read)
- Turning to Reddit for help :)


**Questions**

- Is a career in computer networking worth going back to school or should I consider other options?
- What other colleges should I consider?
- Is an associates degree worth looking at?
- Is there a way to find jobs with tuition reimbursement plans?
- Is anyone else going through something like this that knows what to do, at least more than I do?

Is there a better subreddit for this kind of thing?  I thank you for reading any of this.

A few of us have been batting around the idea of pushing our department (media and communication) towards a four-day week (M/W and T/TR courses) and leaving friday as a day for labs and practicums.  This would allow for hands-on courses like a journalism practicum where students would get an assignment at 9am, research it out, and have the story ready for an afternoon deadline (emulating the real world without having to set aside chunks of the day for other courses).  We would like to do similar things with our audio and video programs.

Reason being, with a mortgage and family, I can't just pick up and leave not drive 4-5 hours to the nearest school with a so-so PhD program (nor would I want to simply do so because Academic traditionalists say so).

My specialization is in Cognition, Instruction, and Learning Technologies with an emphasis in Instructional Design and Game-Based Learning. I realized this morning that the reason I've been so anxious lately is because of the looming job search I need to go through (and the probability that I'll need to move away from where I live in order to find a job that matches my qualifications).

Are there any recent doctoral grads out there who can give advice about how they moved forward when they reached this point in their careers? How difficult was it to find a position? Did you sacrifice personal preference for location to get your foot in the door somewhere?

Of course, recommendations for any job fitting a game-based learning specialist are appreciated, too. :P

So my mom has been mentoring this girl since she was in 7th grade. She'll be a senior next year and is a very smart girl. She's taking all AP classes and has maintained a 3.8 GPA even for being gone for a year form school. Her mom is not a legal citizen, but she is...her mother also doesn't make any money other than to pay for where they live. My mom basically takes care of her. That being said she has high dreams of going to school to become a vet. Unfortunately her mother has constantly crushed her hopes by mocking her. I personally work in Student Affairs but I'm no expert at admissions or financial aid. I want to help her get into UC Davis, and get the most financial aid she can. Even with her GPA I know UC Davis is a long shot. Also does anyone know how FAFSA works for those with parents who aren't legal citizens. Can she file without her parents information? Is that better for her? Chances of a pell grant? Best scholarship opportunities."	t5_2r04r	True

I'm also aware of the average U.S. student loan debt ($25K per student) and our university's: $19K. 

In prepping for this interview, what recommendations do you have so that I can do the proper research? If you have worked in financial aid, what type of questions would you ask? "	t5_2r04r	True

1368212410.0	1e32hk	As state funding erodes for public institutions, will we see increased poaching by private universities of major faculty and centers?	Honestly_	6	1	2	"Obviously, private and public schools have poached faculty for a very long time, but are we going to see a bigger trend moving forward? Especially of centers and their larger footprints of staff and research dollars?

Today there was a headline in Los Angeles that USC, the city's largest private university, [just poached a major lab from it's public rival, UCLA.](http://www.scpr.org/news/2013/05/10/37198/brain-transplant-ucla-s-loni-neuro-imaging-lab-is/)

The Public Radio article pointed out:
&gt;And while many neuroscience labs across the country are struggling to secure funding due to sequestration cuts, Garrett says USC's private donors ensure that the school can continue supporting the work of researchers like Toga and Thompson. 

The [LA Times article](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-la-now-live-201305009-dto,0,6343153.story) posed an interesting, general concern that I've been thinking about for the past several years, particularly after the last economic bust:

&gt; It also raised concerns about the ability of budget-pressed public universities to fend off raids from private colleges.

My public law school (Minnesota) is now almost entirely funded by private tuition, a trend being seen nationally. 

So what do you think? Is this something that's more of a concern when a public institution has a comparable private institution nearby? (certainly, USC/UCLA are more uniquely situated as they're both large AAU schools in the same city)"	t5_2r04r	True

I'm a collegiate reporter who also is exorbitantly frustrated by college, and that's what I want to write about. I've written articles about the cost of college, student loans, debt, tuition increases, university investments, state budgets, education appropriations — all that good stuff that goes into how a university is funded. It's all terribly depressing stuff, and each time I hear more about college costs, the angrier I get for going to college. (Before anyone says it, yes, majoring in journalism was a mistake, I full acknowledge that. But I've also held three other dual majors on-and-off since I started school, and those were all wastes of time, too.)

So I want to write something about college. I'm leaning toward a book because I have an outline already made and definitely the interest and passion to keep it long and interesting. But this is where I need your help, Reddit. I need PEOPLE.

I'm looking for potential people to talk to about the college experience, financial aid struggles, hardships in paying for college or if they have any expertise in college or state funding, financial aid, basically any of the topics I listed above. I'm trying to talk to a wide variety of sources because obviously I have my views about it all, but I don't want that coming across in the book. Ideally I'd like to find current college students from as many states as possible, and from as many socioeconomic backgrounds as possible.

I just had the idea to make something tangible out of this a few days ago so I have nothing to show for it yet. But I really want this to happen some day, whether it's published for a media organization or on my own. So I'm trying this whole Reddit crowdsourcing thing out to see what comes out of it. So if it sounds like you'd be interested, let me know. Looking forward to seeing what (if any) responses I get! Thanks, all!

I am an upper-level undergraduate in biology. I have a great GPA, 3.6. I have stellar GREs. I'm told I'm competitive for the Ivy League when it comes to PhD programs.

I value learning. I value critical thinking. I value an education. I value being aware of the world around me. I value putting myself to a task and finishing it. I value the personal growth that comes from education.

So tell me, what the hell is this phenomenon I see around reddit where you get a lot of people - maybe they're college dropouts, people who never BOTHERED, people who are anti-intellectual, people who did poorly in high school and college, people whose degrees ended up getting them salaries they don't like - who are so negative about higher education? Who are these people so negative about college and graduate school?

And, more importantly, how do we get them to recognize how wrong they are? The BLS statistics on earnings by degree (TL;DR: got a college degree? you're making almost twice as much as anybody without one, and unemployment plummets too), other government stats, they're definitely NOT wrong.

1350464152.0	11meiz	"Teacher training in The Netherlands: ""Human Dynamics"""	blacknumber1	4	2	0	"Dear (would-be) teachers,

I'm an English teacher in the Netherlands at a vocational school. Our collective labor agreement stimulates ""continuous learning"" for teachers and I agree that as individuals we should be inclined to keep developing our skills. However, I feel that certain educational theories and training courses are doing more harm than good.

Just to offer a little context: education in NL is moving towards a more student-centered approach, which means teachers have to be more aware of students' diversity, learning abilities, learning disabilities etc.

I like to think that I'm a very involved/concerned teacher, and I take a lot of care to give all my students enough attention and to help them learn the material in the best way possible - I get pretty passionate about the importance of language in life. 

One of the ""professional"" training courses I have to follow is called ""Human Dynamics"" - a concept/theory invented by an American ""doctor"" named Sandra Seagal and her husband: to me it's the biggest load of bullshit I've ever read/heard and I want to hear your thoughts on this. 

So, obviously everyone's different: psychologists have discussed the ""Big 5"" personality traits at large, but Seagal is a new-age wacko. 

Basically, she says there are three aspects that govern human experience: mental, emotional, and physical.

Everyone contains a combination of these three aspects, but everyone has one dominant aspect: so you get combinations like 
mental-emotional
emotional-physical
physical-emotional etc.

Apparently, each combination has its own merits and each individual thus has unique learning/working abilities. 

So, for example, she says someone who's emotional-physical (apparently 55% of the population) has the following traits:

*talks often, especially about feelings and emotions
*easily makes contact with others, maintains harmonious relationships
*in touch with own feelings, empathetic
*trusts emotions, sensitive to ambience* 
*relates everything to oneself, critical of self
*creative, artistic, expressive, versatile, wide-ranging interests

The whole point is that I'm supposed to become aware of and exploit all these differences so everyone can work together and everyone can learn in their own way (the individualistic credo). 

Again, I think this is 100% new-age pseudo-scientific occultist bullshit, but it's a huge thing here in The Netherlands. I know two other teachers in my department who swear by this, but I don't think it's very useful; I'm open-minded to things, but this is just too much. 

I'm young (25), but I'm more part of the old-school teaching methods. I think I'm a decent teacher; I feel like I can inspire my students to critically think about language and I get positive feedback. I respect my students' differences and I'm always prepared to go the extra mile for them. 


Does anyone else have any similar experiences? I hear Human Dynamics also really caught on in Sweden.

Feedback is greatly appreciated!!!!

This summer another student and I created a website that is on its way to being a phenomenal student resource (currently at 760 student users).

The URL is [ http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

All you need to sign up is a .edu email address. As an avid user of the world wide web I know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at jhamilton@openleaf.me

Hopefully those of you that are still students and try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.

Also before you say anything, yes it does have some similarities to reddit. We ""borrowed"" some of our favorite features from the site we spend the majority of our time on because we feel that giving the users control of the content makes the internet better.

TL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.

I have a couple of questions to ask, but some inside information. I'm 21 years old this September, I've lived in Ontario my whole life, I graduated high school at the very end of 2010 (I took an extra semester) and September 2011 I started my first year of University. Now I found it hard to know what I wanted to do and ended up not enjoying my first year (ECE), so after my first year I dropped and worked for a year because I wanted to move to BC, which I will be actually arriving to next week. I want to go to UBC for next September 2014, and take Biology. The classes I took in Ontario don't meet all the program requirements but I'll be taking adult school in BC to make up for the few that I need. Now first, I know you guys will wonder why I didn't ask a high school adviser this question but by the time I actually wondered how this works high school were closed already for the summer and I don't someone directly from there to ask.
But okay, the first question is when I start the adult school in BC do I need to take all the program requirements? Because the University has different provincial requirements, so how do they combine them, I don't want to take extra classes if I don't have to.
These are the specific provincial requirements for the two provinces, ( *** means I already have that credit) : 

Ontario:

English 12 (ENG4U) ***

Advanced Functions (MHF4U) (minimum 67%)

 [1]
One of Biology 12 (SBI4U), Chemistry 12 (SCH4U), or Physics 12 (SPH4U)

Three other Grade 12 4U or M courses ***

Chemistry 11 (SCH3U)***

BC:

English 12 or English 12 First Peoples

Principles of Mathematics 12 or Pre-calculus 12 (minimum 67%)

Two other approved Grade 12 courses, including at least one Biology 12, Chemistry 12, Geography 12, Geology 12, or Physics 12

Chemistry 11
 
So yeah, if you could just let me know how they combined them that would be great, especially since I have the 3 other 12 U or M credits which were really good grades, I want to take as little classes as possible in the adult school and hopefully I can apply to UBC earlier for January 2014.

Second questions is though, sometime a long time ago when I was first looking into this, I think I recalled something saying that high school marks are valid for only 3 years. Is this true? If it is does that mean my grade 12 high school marks are void since grade 12 ran from Sep 2009 - Dec 2010 (extra sem) for me.

Sorry for all this rambling, but its just had me worrying a lot.

In LSU's press release they say the cost of the online MBA ""will cost students about $15,000."" Only problem is it's a 36 credit program and they list the cost per credit hour at $1,046 on their landing page (they don't have a real website for online). That would put the total program cost at $37,656, not $15,000. 

Not directly accusing LSU of anything unethical, but as the online space continues to get more competitive, this kind of cloudy behavior is eerily familiar of the for-profits. I would hope with increased non-profit entrants we could usher in a more ethical and open era in online edu.

I was a terrible college student; I chose a lousy degree (history), never did my homework, and often showed up to class drunk. Somehow, I still graduated with a 2.9 GPA.

Upon graduation, I kept the full-time retail job that had paid my tuition. Three years later, I'm 27 years old and I've done nothing with my life. I currently make $36,000 in that same job, and am starting to hate it.

Some things have changed recently. My s/o left me, I quit drinking, and I quit smoking weed. I need a change of scenery, and I want to take life a lot more seriously. I want to do something new and exciting, something meaningful.

So I've decided to start with a new education in a field that will lead to a career. At the moment, I'm considering mechanical engineering or robotics. I realize that this a lot of schooling; I'm willing to do it, but I don't know where to start.

I'm guessing that because I have no background in science, going straight for a master's program is out of the question. So... do I try to get another bachelor's from a different university in science? Is it common (or even possible) for people to get two bachelor's? Then do graduate work from there? Or would it be better to find a trade school or a community college and start at a slower pace to get a feel for science?

I know very little about science, but I have a great curiosity for it; and I'm not good at math, but 27-year-old me is a lot more willing to work hard to learn than 22-year-old me was.

Also, I'm not set on engineering-- if anyone is aware of a career path that could actually utilize my history degree (or the resulting skill set, including writing skills and critical thinking), then I'm all ears.

&gt;To be eligible to the International master’s programme in political science the applicant needs 
to fulfil the eligibility requirements formulated in the education plan, i.e. to have a “Bachelor 
of Arts degree in political science or the equivalent” (180 ECTS credit points or the 
equivalent of which 90 ECTS credits in political science).

I have a B.A. in Psychology with minors in Political Science and Peace and Conflict studies.  Are there ways around this? Have you or anyone you know accomplished this?

I think I just want to know if it's at all possible.  I've always loved learning across fields and applying what I know from those fields to the different classes.  It would really be a downer if my degree would prevent me from entering a masters program in other fields.

That being said, I picked up the Kaplan GMAT book. First up, math. Epic fail on that section as I am math retarded. Decided I need a math refresher. So I pick up a math refresher book. I have finally discovered how jacked up my math skills are. It took me about four or five minutes to do 45.67*.987 by hand (as you can't use a calculator in the test). I had to do it....twice. 

Math has always been the worst of my subjects, but its one of the biggest portions of the GMAT. I understand HOW to do it, I just cant multiply, divide, add or subtract anything, beyond small, simple numbers in my head. For anything larger, I have to do it in multiples of two with tally marks to track how many I've done. Example, of it would be 9*7. I have to do it like this.

ETC.

Does anyone else have this problem? I need to get into grad school, but I feel the math portion is going to be the tire tied around my feet while I try to swim. Just the constant hitting my face against the wall on this is wearing me out. I need a stiff drink.

I have worked as a behavior instructor for kids with Autism and as an intern at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility. I am almost done with a program in drug and alcohol counseling at UCLA(open enrollment, not graduate school).

I plan on continuing my education and either getting a masters in psych and an MFT or something similar. I found that I enjoy working in a therapeutic context, but I am concerned it wont be as lucrative as I hope.

On the other hand I am considering a PhD in Psychology and then studying psychedelics, schizophrenia, religious experience and altered states of consciousness in general. Does anyone have experience with both research and therapy or possibly teaching? If so is it possible to make a decent living as a researcher with a PhD along with teaching some courses?

For the first time I have had to face the question: what type of room do you place a trans-sexual student in university housing?  The ideal answer is obviously gender neutral housing but at my institution that is not an option.

We have a student who was born male but is transitioning to be a female.  I neither know nor want to know at what stage in the process she is.  Looking at her you would never be able to tell but in the system she is still under her birth name and sex.  

My colleagues and I had a long discussion whether to place her in a male of female room.  This student is well known in our office and we all refer to her as her. 

It is clear that this student identifies as a woman, she goes by a female name, wears female clothing, and has had cosmetic surgery to give herself breasts.  Our discussion ultimately defaulted to our policy and we went by birth sex.  Luckily, we had an open male room in a suite so she had her own living space and only had to share a bathroom.  

I see the benefit of defaulting to the policy.  It is a CYA move; which is sometimes the answer BUT I believe that this solution is one that ignores the needs of our students, particularly our trans-sexual and transgender students.  The best answer would be to offer gender neutral housing (which I honestly don't see happening due to the forces that be).  Are there other ways to better handle this situation in the future?  What are some of the policies/procedures your departments have used in similar situations?

**TL;DR We placed a transsexual student (born male) in a male room.  How would your dept handle a similar situation?**

About one year ago they hired several folks from For Profit schools. (They were looking for jobs due to the heat their previous University's were going under, read: the federal oversight.) 

They ""lead"" through fear and terror. Most of my colleagues have quit or gotten let go. There are only a handful of us ""old timers"" left. I'd go tomorrow if I had a job. Hell - Starbucks or Wal-mart. The daily pressure they are exerting is extreme and relentless.

Unfair that a non-profit can NOW use For Profit tactics, and yet not fall under review of the congressional investigation.

Seems like something is amiss.

I half feel like alerting our regional accreditation council. 

Know anyone else going through this? 

Some of the practices:
- several times a day emails saying how poorly we are doing
- Telling all team members everyone's numbers and in front of everyone, berating those with low numbers
- writing up people with letters in their employee files saying their work is substandard (and this is for folks that haven been recruiting successfully for 6 years, just not able to get the numbers that have been created - which are unattainable.)
- Since this team has arrived, when someone leaves, they hire recruiters with NO degrees. Not even associates. They have NO college experience, but they are good in sales. 

I know for a fact if I recruited they way they want me to, retention would go to hell in a basket. Not to mention I'm in a small area. The word of mouth would travel fast and we'd simply implode.

What worries me most is that I don't know how I'd get reference letters.

Would this be possible or likely? What would I need to do to make it happen? I'm most interested in getting a BS in Computer Science.

I would have to relocate to get a degree in this field even from a Canadian school, and considering I am looking to get a job in the US eventually, it seemed like a decent idea to consider.

Alternatively, would it be easier if I completed one year in a Canadian university, then transferred?

I just finish all my classes for my AA in the spring term. I am taking Spanish 2 in the summer to fulfill the foreign language requirement the class will finish at the end of July. This is the email the admission office send me
We are unable to continue review of your file until we have received documentation that you have met the foreign language admission requirement. The deadline to meet this requirement is July 1, and there are no guarantees that we will be able to consider information after this time.
However, you may send in your transcripts immediately after your grades post, or submit an application for a future term when you have met the foreign language requirement.
To apply for a future term, please submit a new application at https://admissions.fsu.edu/undergradapp/. Florida State will keep your application fee and any previously sent material on file for up to two years.
So it seems like they will not review my application at all since my class won't be finish in time for the deadline. I kind of think its mess up since I know people are being admitted before they finish their AA classes. It's a different story if my application is being review and rejected but they won't even review it.

This is the rundown of NAU's Personalized Learning program:
--A six-month subscription is $2,500. You can complete as many courses as you can in that six months. 
--No application, program, book, course or lab fees.
--No required texts. All course materials are included and available online.
--No semesters. You can start at any time.
--You can transfer in credits from other colleges/universities.
--Three degrees offered: BA in Computer Information Technology, BA in Liberal Arts, and BA in Small Business Administration.
--It is regionally accredited. 

I've been following competency-based degrees and personalized learning in higher ed, and (in my humble opinion) this one takes the cake in value and quality. What are your thoughts? Do you agree?"	t5_2r04r	True

I'm a History graduate from the UK. I've been out of Uni for 2 years now and I've struggled to find work related to my degree. I've decided that whilst I'm still young, I will go back into education with the aims of getting myself another more practical degree. I am looking at getting A Levels in maths and economics to get the requirements for the degree I choose. ( Apologies for lack of specifics, this is an epiphany I've had in the past few days and is still in its early stages of development. ) If anyone has any advice as to where to my A Levels i.e. should I go to college, do it online? If anyone can tell me what I should be looking at in this stage, that would be most excellent!
Basically, if anyone has advice on this situation, that would be awesome!

Best regards, Pandacatcat!
