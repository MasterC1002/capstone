I was having a bad day, and hour worth of clicking ""random"" led me here. I am in no way familiar with the 'subject', but...  

...You gorgeous human beings give me so much hope.  
Sometimes it feels that this world is filled with only racists and homophobes and what not, but then I find people like you and the faith is restored.  
You must have gone through so much pain and suffering in your life, but still you guys carry on and work so hard to make yourself happy, and when you achieve your goals and let the whole world see your beautiful smile, finally in the body where you belong, and what you deserve, it makes me smile. It makes me smile so much.  
Even the toughest looking guy can be a pretty princess on the inside, and he should have the possibility to be just that. That should be considered normal.  
It should be normal to be yourself.
  
Everyone should look up to you.  
You make the choice to be happy. And no one can stop you.  
  
You are all awesome, and so beautiful.
  
Have a nice day! :)

This may seem really weird for a random stranger to say but I am so proud of each and every one of you. I am so happy that you are able to become the people you want to be. 

I can't imagine any of your journeys have been easy; there are still a lot of nasty, hateful people out there but I want you to know that there are also plenty of people like me who support and admire your strength and courage. 

Congratulations to all of you for being strong and following your heart. Your progress should be motivation for all of us to take charge and become who we want to be, whether that means changing genders or not.

Nothing has been done about it, but that's a long and different story.  This is just something I need to vent about because I have to tell someone, and I can't tell anyone that I know in person.

While at work, a customer referred to me as ma'am.  I do not pass, I am not attempting to pass, I was just at work in guy mode being a fake.  He called me ma'am entirely by accident because he was on autopilot and clearly very frazzle.  As soon as he realized what he had said, he looked horrified.  He began to apologize.

Calling me ma'am in the first place set off many different internal triggers, but it was his profuse apologies that truly upset me.  Not that he was apologizing, that in itself was fine.  He thought he had insulted me, and he was trying to be nice.  He kept repeating ""I'm sorry sir, I wasn't even paying attention sir, I wasn't trying to say anything sir,"" and more, over and over.  Every time he did it again I had to smile, and say it was fine, and I understood, when all I wanted to do was beg him to stop calling me that, but I knew he wouldn't understand.  Every time he said it just made me feel worse, and the rest of my effort for the next several hours was focused on not bursting into tears.

I don't even know if this is appropriate for this subreddit. Don't know what my purpose for posting this really is, to be honest.

1357553973.0	164446	[Meta] Hi new subscribers, a few ground rules		68	14	6	"It seems we're getting an influx of new subscribers from 2XC. Welcome ladies.

I'd like to take this opportunity to mention a few things about this community that you should take to heart if you wish to participate:

1. Note the rules in the sidebar, this is a strictly moderated space due to its nature and you will get at most one warning if the mods are in a good mood.

2. This is not a place to criticize those in the timelines. As the rules say, if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all.

3. Don't give unsolicited ""advice"". You don't know what a person does/doesn't want to improve about themselves and it is often hurtful and unwanted when not specifically asked for. That means if someone asks for advice on hair, don't start also giving them advice on makeup.

4. This is primarily a space for trans people to be inspired by their peers and to get a sense of validation. Respect that and don't treat us like zoo animals.

7. Do not share these timelines around without permission from the person in the picture. They are posted here in good faith that they won't be spread to places the owner doesn't want.

5. Please don't advertise this subreddit without checking with the mods first.

6. No mod sass."	t5_2u0oa	True

You're probably wondering why there is a written text submitted to your subreddit.
To be honest, I'm not transgender. I sometimes wander to this page and sometimes to /r/transgender, and tonight I just felt so compelled to write you all about how I feel.
I've never met a transgender person. Or perhaps I have, and I've not been aware of it. But from looking at your timelines, your stories...
I am so so so inspired by you all. :) You all took a risk of coming out as trans, no matter what your family or friends thought. You did it for yourself, so you could truly be you.
I just want to say that I admire your courage and your confidence. I'm so sure that thanks to you, many other people will step up to make the right decision for themselves, too. Not only that, you'll make people smile like you made me smile. :)
Keep on shining, sunshine, because you're such a lovely person.

*EDIT:
Terribly sorry for causing some trouble. :( I didn't quite use the correct terms, and I didn't express myself clearly enough. Please understand that I didn't mean to knock anybody down with my words.
Thank you, though, for clearing up my information. I now find myself more informed!

When I first started to get erections, I would push my penis back into my body.

Even before puberty, I would roll up pillows inside their pillowcases and stick them in my shirt, barely cognizant that I was giving myself giant breasts. I would put another pillow between my legs and then put my jeans on and I would relish the smoothness of my crotch and how far apart my hips felt. Not really aware of sexuality or gender, the child me just pretended to be fat. I would often go to sleep with pillows in my clothes.

Before I could buy my own nail polish, I tried using a pink highlighter on my nails.

Once, my uncle forced me to get a haircut. I decided that I hated it, mostly because it was short, and I cried all the way home.

At the beginning of puberty, I looked up how to speak with a feminine voice. With no more resources than a single web page, over the years I would practice in the shower and at night speaking as a female, as if this talent would be useful someday. I would often talk with people over voice chat when playing video games or on a Ventrilo/Teamspeak server with a girl voice.

In highschool, I would shave my arms and legs. One time, a girl who sat next to me in English class noticed and asked me if I shaved my arms. I was embarrassed.

I also bought tighter jeans. I would wear two pairs of jeans so that my rear and my legs would look thicker and rounder.

At this point, I had longer than normal hair.

When I wanted to buy a Nintendo DS, I decided to spend extra money in order to purchase a Pearl Pink DS which is only available in Japan. Then I was convinced to trade it to the girl I was crazy about, receiving her ordinary grey one. Eventually, I bought a pink shell and modded it myself.

I also would occasionally paint my nails.

There was a point in time where I would douse myself in lavender lotions and drink only soy milk.

I experimented with razors, Nair, wax strips, and eventually settled on using an Epilator to deal with body hair. I hated my leg hair.

I went to Goodwill for the first time by myself. I rode there on a bike, even though everything feels far away if you’re used to riding in a car. I bought a skirt. I rationalized that I would just resell it or something. I still have it.

I couldn’t deal with homework or school and I was depressed. When I was a kid, someone teased me and asked if I had a mental disorder. I said “Yes,” because I thought of depression. I saw a wonderful therapist during high school who suggested I had adjustment disorder with depressive symptoms. Before I could really bring up any gender identity issues, he passed away. I still haven’t found another therapist.

For some reason I really liked Esquire Magazine. I don’t know what that means.

At this point I had moved on from pillows to socks and shirts stuffed inside bras. I found that blowing up a rubber balloon inside another rubber balloon would work decently well. There was a terrible accident with a water filled balloon, because I would go to sleep with them in my bra. By now, this had become a very sexual thing. My preferred method of masturbation was by vibrator.

I still wish on stars.

I never put down my gender or my real name anywhere online.

My friend got a Hello Kitty debit card. I got one too.

The first time I crossdressed in public was for a friend’s birthday/Halloween costume party. I went as a girl. I was well received. Someone asked me about it but it would take me years to come up with a female name.

A female friend of mine wanted to buy adhesive strapless bras for wearing with her prom dress. I bought two if them to stick in my bra. Then I bought another pair. Eventually, I would order silicone breast forms from Ebay. I’m on my third pair.

I stopped practicing guitar because my nails were often too long. I didn't want to cut them short and take off the nail polish.

I read some erotic fiction. And all of it was males were turned into females through magic or chemicals or something. The idea of turning female was extremely sexually arousing. I eventually found a lot of Japanese hentai on the subject, and then western comics.

A friend of a friend that I knew decently well came out as gay. Then she came out as trans. I didn’t really think much of her transition. But then her also trans girlfriend moved in with her. And this new girl I was jealous of because she was on hormones.

One day I got my ears pierced. It took days for my parents to notice the placeholder rings.

I ordered new glasses online. They have stars and flowers on them and a definitely feminine outline.

I dyed my hair red. I used to spend money at salons. Now I just do it myself.

Gradually, my female wardrobe increased. Payless has lots of shoes in my size. I love my extra long thigh high striped socks. I had female jeans, skirts, and countless female fit t-shirts. Bras, panties, a hoodie and coat, hats, necklaces, even a cute watch.

At this point I gave up on shaving and started epilating/plucking the hairs on my face. I looked very different with shaped eyebrows. And with way less five o’clock shadow, I could wear makeup to hide it completely.

I bought a pochette bag and tried carrying it around. It was too small and eventually I found a bag that I love and carry around every day.

I changed my wallet from brown leather to a faux leather one with sushi print. Now I have a Hello Kitty wallet.

At this point I would sometimes dress female, mostly based on how much facial hair I had at the time and how nice my hair looked. My friends kind of just accepted it. I look pretty natural in girl-mode, thankfully.

I looked through names one day online. I picked one that I kinda liked and I used it online. Now it’s my online name everywhere. I have my friends call me by it when I’m in girl-mode. It’s on my business cards.

More and more I would get ‘Ma’am’ed. At this point, even if I don’t shave and just wear ordinary male clothes I still get referred to with female pronouns by old or inattentive people. Even when I’m not using my female voice.

On my 24th birthday, I ordered Estradiol and Spironolactone pills online. I’m currently waiting for them to come. I just wish I could have thought to do this much sooner.

I imagine that a lot of other people have had similar experiences, clues that maybe you weren't really satisfied with your gender. Anyways, [here is what I look like](http://i.imgur.com/UKc34De). Feel free to add your own experiences in the comments. "	t5_2u0oa	True

Im 24 years old and I am finally trying to face who I really am on the inside. For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to be a girl, I used to spends nights just praying that maybe some ""god"" would realize the mistake he made and turn me into a girl over night.

 As a kid I always ""dressed up"" stealing my aunts and mom's clothes I always thought this was just me being weird and that I would grow out of it but throughout the years every time I try to stop I always end up buying more girls clothing and dressing in secret. I try'd to repress this side of me I joined the military in the manliest career field I could find and just tried to forget about those secret's..Less than 6 month's later I was dressing again spending hundred's of dollars of clothing and makeup. I would then freak out throw everything away repress the feelings again and the process would repeat. I have probably spent $1500 + on women's clothing and haven't worn it outside since middle school.

This has continued up to the point Im at right now...Rock bottom basically - I have pushed everyone in my life away and only really talk to my mom.  A no-lifer if you will   my day's are filled with video games and school nothing else. I realize that I can't go on living like this but I am terrified of the next steps. 

Currently I am scared to proceed in my current state - I am 6'1 215lbs I put on 40 lbs from just pure depression in the last 1 1/2 year's.
 Me- [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GvDIEa9.jpg[/IMG]

I have a few Questions and hopefully this will give me confidence to continue.

1. I realize that I am a bit heavy should I concentrate on losing the weight before going to a therapist or should I start the process asap?

2. Is there anything I can do PRE everything to make myself prettier? ex. I am terrified of going through the process just to look like a guy in makeup and long hair.  -  Money really isnt an Issue saved around $12000 to help with this.

3. After looking at my picture do you think I would ever pass with my bone structure and big nose?

also I am out of the military at this point. Going back to community college with a focus on IT stuff.

1373735423.0	1i84js	So I finished my first round of voice therapy, here are the results... (hard data inside)	nikkistarzz	27	3	5	"I finished a round of speech therapy sessions at my local university recently. It was a great experience and since I was working with a student, it was far cheaper than going to a speech therapy clinic.

The sessions were monitored by a speech pathologist (I'm assuming their teacher) and ran for 8 weeks. I plan on doing another round in September when the sessions begin again. It cost me $160 for all sessions, and in Septemeber, the cost will be the same, but that group of sessions runs for 10-12 weeks. So, it's even more bang for my buck. 

I highly suggest girls looking to improve their voice reach out to their local university and see if they have a speech therapy dept. that offers therapy to the general public. It's a way to get cheap voice therapy and also educate others on trans* things whom may never experience it otherwise. So it's a win-win really.

Here are my results after 8 sessions:

**Beginning of therapy (male voice)**

* Pitch during relaxed “ah”: **133.36Hz**
* Pitch during conversation: **132.56Hz** *(typical male: 100Hz to 130Hz)*
* Conversational pitch range: **91.07 Hz to 187.97Hz** *(typical male range: 80Hz to 165Hz)*
* Lowest pitch “ah”: **83.06Hz**
* Highest pitch “ah”: **413.22Hz**


**End of therapy (female voice)**

* Pitch during relaxed “ah”: **142.04Hz**
* Pitch during conversation: **168.76Hz** *(typical female: 170Hz – 220Hz)*
* Conversational pitch range **134.31Hz to 246.41Hz** *(typical female range: 145Hz to 275Hz)*
* Lowest pitch “ah”: **86.66Hz**
* Highest pitch “ah”: **561.80Hz**

So as you can see, my male voice is already a bit higher than the average male. However, my new female voice is still a bit lower than the average female. Hence me doing another round of sessions in September. Also, will obvi keep practising! And I wish there was a way to measure resonance! If there is, and I'm not aware of it, let me know!

I was thinking about waiting for my 3-6 month mark on hormones, but I'd like to get an idea from others. My thinking, is that I wouldn't feel comfortable dressing and going out in public until I can at least mildly pass.	t5_2u0oa	True

There are few other reports on breast development and hair regrowth.  

Has this been studied elsewhere with verified clinical data?

1st subject: I need help coming out in the first place. I am quite a nervous person and well I'm not sure how my family would react

2nd: Averagely how much does the therapy cost? I ts one of the reason I'm scared to ask for it. I am under age so I do need parents consent. Money is tight and I don't want feel like I am going to drain us of money

I am very afraid of transition due to my age (33 years). But I think  my face is cute and so may be I will be passable. The problem is I am of Indian decent and I did not find anyone from Indian decent who look like western transsexual. So, I am confused. I do not want to look like hijra."	t5_2u0oa	True

I have been on hrt for about 9 months now, and was thinking of doing it around the 16 month mark. What I'm not sure about is if that is the right thing to do. I have grown to an A cup, but I'm not sure if they will grow much bigger because I don't want to spend all that money if they are going to grow still.
I was wondering if anyone knew about when breast growth plateaus and has any advice for me. Thanks ahead of time."	t5_2u0oa	True
