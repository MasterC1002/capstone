The first Dinosaur Family of the Week is now up and running!  We're doing [Vulcanodontidae.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/scixz/the_first_ever_dinosaur_family_of_the_week_april/)  
Everyone have fun!

**/edit**


I really like r/Dinosaurs, and want to see it thrive.  I have an idea to throw out there; please join in the discussion and add how *you* think r/Dinosaurs could be better!  (Also, please upvote this so the community can see it; I gain no karma from this post.)

I would like to propose that we brush up on various dinosaurs in a fun way, revitalizing the subreddit and seeing new content on it every day.

What would you say to having a ""Family of the Week"", where we all learn about a family of dinosaurs?  The chosen family would be announced at the beginning of the week, and most of the submissions that week would be about that family  (not all- for sure if people find something interesting, they should submit it even if it's an unrelated dinosaur!).  

Example:  
[The Family of the Week is: Spinosauridae!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Spinosauridscale.png)

And then submissions following it that week could look like:  

* [OMG is that a fish?!](http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/173/8/8/baryonyx_walkeri_by_great_oharu-d3jnu6a.jpg)  

* [Nice detail of a Baryonyx Walkeri's head](http://www.dinosaur-world.com/weird_dinosaurs/species/baryonyx_walkeri.gif)

* [Do you find me... Irritating?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritator_challengeri)  

* [Oh man, is there anything WolframAlpha doesn't know?](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinosauridae)

* [Pretty battle-worn Spinosaurus...](http://i.imgur.com/tll6s.jpg)

And so on!  

Hah, I actually just learned a lot putting this together.  

So, if you're all partial to my idea, we can begin (dramatic echo effect) **the r/Dinosaur Family of the Week** Week^Week^Week^Week

ThaiSweetChilli	41	5	14	"I went through the most popular subreddits to see if I could subscribe to anything else which caught my interests and I was completely distraught that in 6 pages I had not come across any popular dinosaur subreddits! Not even an /r/Jurassic Park!

I've *always* loved dinosaurs. As a child, the very idea and thought that these enormous creatures used to live on this very planet astonished me and I'd grab every book on dinosaurs that I could find.

So I propose that to help make one of my most loved childhood subjects (loved even to this day) popular, that we perhaps encourage dinosaur discussions! Hypothetical questions, 'what if' questions, to make the interested dinomaniacs curious for more.

Should we make this subreddit scheme a lot more snazzy? How about an 'earthy' background with dinosaur fossils burried like how the Minecraft forum is (look behind/over the borders) http://www.minecraftforum.net/
With people digging down the way at the top/subreddit bar?

Oh gosh.. **DINOSAUR FLAIRS!**!

What about mods have a 'dinosaurs of the week' thing going on where they post facts or descriptions about dinosaurs, especially the least popular/least known ones?

However, I am suggesting that we don't allow people to post things that are clearly against all of the current evidence. 

Right now the top post in the subreddit is ""This is it, no more feather bullcrap!"" (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/1aeqof/this_is_it_no_more_feather_bullcrap/) Scientifically and culturally this really concerns me, because it promotes a sense of entitlement that is anti-science and refuses to change in the face of overwhelming evidence. This is the same attitude that was held by people who freaked out about Pluto no longer being a planet or the merging of torosaurus and triceratops. 

This is dangerous because it lets people take anecdotal nostalgia as scientific evidence. We have known for years that some dinosaurs had feathers, and that some dinosaurs had scales and many had both. I find it really concerning that someone would take a really exciting fossil that can show us a lot about dinosaurs and instead politicize it by promoting the anti-paleontology attitude promoted by Jurassic Park. The same attitude that says velociraptors were 7 foot tall scaled beasts that ran around kitchens hunting children. It makes for a great movie, but really bad science and we should not promote it on this subreddit. 

Again to clarify its fine if people post pictures they drew or craft projects they did that are not 100% scientifically accurate, those are awesome and one of my favorite things about this subreddit. However we should promote people to ask questions like ""Does this fossil of scales disprove feathered dinosaurs?"" which would promote dinosaurs so we can discuss the science and the evidence.

tldr; Moderators should remove content that makes scientifically inaccurate claims, which would allow for  posts that ask legitimate questions or show of the creativity of this subreddit to get more attention. "	t5_2qmoq	True

The book I loved the most was an encyclopaedia but (to cut a very long story short) I donated it, but now I really want to find it again.

It was an encyclopedia that had a double pages devoted to each dinosaur and went through a whole bunch of dinosaurs alphabetically. It also looked at flying and amphibious reptiles from the dinosaur era as well. I've forgotten how long it was but I think that it was between 150-300 pages. 

On the front of the book it had a painted image of a sauropod (an Apatosaurus I think). I've forgotten the name, but it might have been as simple as ""Dinosaurs"".

I've checked Amazon but I can't seem to find it. It wasn't a cartoony kids encylopedia, but nor was it a serious and boring academic tome. 

So /r/Dinosaurs, do you think you know the book I'm talking about? "	t5_2qmoq	True

I really cannot buy the idea that Tyrannosaurus Rex was a ***full time, exclusive*** scavenger.  It's simply too well equipped for killing.  The massiveness of the animal certainly slowed it down, but with that mass comes some advantages like the ability to overpower struggling prey.


Of course, it would scavenge on occasion, as do nearly all large predators. Lions, wolves, grizzly bears, and sharks will all eagerly consume carrion for example. Alternately, animals like hyenas and jackals, which we call scavengers, are actually very proficient hunters as well.


Anyway, the whole *""T-rex is a scavenger""* came from it being determined that the animal was too large to move quickly, and would exert too much energy in a drawn out pursuit.  I think that its wrong to assume, that just because t-rex wasn't a *runner* that it wasn't a hunter. After all, most predators hunt prey that is actually faster than them. T-rex could have relied on ambush, superior maneuvering, an intelligence advantage, or even pack hunting to acquire prey. As far as chasing its prey down, a predator only needs to be a little quicker than it's prey for a very short time. Even if T-rex topped out at 12mph, surely it's prey really wasn't much faster. Most hadrosaurs, iguanodons, and ceratopsids are not exactly built for speed after all."	t5_2qmoq	True

It was an event that has defied all attempts at a satisfactory explanation.

EDWIN H. COLBERT, The Age of Reptiles


R/Dinosaurs today celebrates an outstanding event in the history of life and in the history of earth... we have reached 300 members! Well, of course this occasion may not be as momentous as the destruction of the dinosaurs, and I may be exagerating a little bit about the impact on human history but it is still an exciting day her at r/dinosaurs.

I would like to thank everyone for contributing to this subreddit and would encourage everyone to talk about r/dinosaurs non-stop, print T-shirts for your friends, take at local adverts in either newspapers or television and anything to help our little community grow.

SO, what that means is, say, you want to be ""Team Ankylosaurus."" OK, cool, that's a decent dinosaur, sure. However, there's no pic for that. If you want a pic, you can edit the css class next to your flair (if you can find that area) and type in the name of a default. Example: You could be flair: Team Ankylosaurus with css class: pterodactyl. OK?

History: There was moderator discussion of doing this a while back (a year ago?), but we couldn't figure out how to do it. 

Then, last week, some of our dino users requested this, and provided a little help to get the ball rolling. [link to post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dinosaurs/comments/1e3tog/im_thinking_we_could_improve_the_flair/)

You  might need to re-pick your flair to activate pictures, or you might just edit your flair and add a css class. For reference, you can only enter the following words in the css class field: 

    parasaurolophus, deinonychus, mammal, tyrannosaurus, triceratops, stegosaurus, 

    pterodactyl, brachiosaurus, compsognathus, therizinosaurus

Oh, yeah, due to his popularity, I added therizinosaurus as a default team with a picture. Win. 

Mods, I added css classes to your flair for frontpage display purposes. Feel free to modify.

Enjoy! I don't really know how this all works, but it looks cool!

I took it with me, and asked the dad if he had a box, and while he found one for me, the two kids were interested in the pigeon. The older kid (4) went off eventually, but the young one (2) was really interested. 

He's a real sweetheart, absolute nicest kid i've ever met. He's just about learning to talk, he speaks in syllables that are a rough approximation of the words he wants.

Anyway he was looking at the pigeon and i said 'He's a cute little dinosaur, isn't he?' A little frown creased his face and he said hesitantly 'Na, ee a ba...' (no, it's a bird) and i said 'Yes, he is a bird, but look at his feet!'
I lifted the pigeon slightly and put a finger under one of the feet, and the pigeon wrapped his scaly pink toes round my finger. 'Do you see how he has scaly dinosaur feet and claws? Birds are a type of dinosaur!' 
For a second the frown deepened, then his eyes got as wide as saucers in delighted shock, and he look at me grinning and said 'RAAAAAAAH!'

I remember how much more awesome birds suddenly were when i figured out that they were dinosaurs, it was the highlight of my day to be part of that moment for him."	t5_2qmoq	True

&gt;From Wikipedia: [Dinosaurs Attack!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_Attack!) is a trading card series by Topps, released in 1988. The cards tell the story of dinosaurs transported through time into the present day through a freak accident and wreaking havoc on Earth. The series is notable for its graphic violence and gore, intended to evoke memories of the successful Mars Attacks trading card series of 1962.

The company [Fright-Rags](http://www.fright-rags.com/) is doing two limited edition shirts as a homage to the cards. I own serveral of their shirts and they are great quality.

I have no idea how it would/if it could  work but i was thinking of maybe having a dinosaur of the day/week post. In my mind this would just be a text post with a bit of basic info about the dinosaur. People could then comment other facts, discuss and just generally widen there knowledge on these great creatures. let me know what you think!	t5_2qmoq	True

1348706391.0	10jd1c	Dinosaur Civilization	GalacticGhidorah	13	8	40	"I have been wondering about something for a while. The dinosaurs were around for 150 million years or so (correct me if I'm wrong), and we started a civilization around 4 or 5 million years after the first human ancestors evolved. In the dinosaurs' timetable, a civilization would have theoretically evolved 10 times. If the dinosaurs did create a civilization, how far would it have taken for them to get there? And how far along would they have gotten before the asteroid hit? I think the most likely species to do that is the Trodon, since they were among the smartest dinosaurs. What are your thoughts on this?

Edit: Also, how much of an effect would that have had on the other dinosaurs? There are countless species on the endangered species list now. If a species of dinosaurs, maybe the Trodons, made a civilization, would that have made more species go extinct faster? And let's assume that they evolved the same way we did"	t5_2qmoq	True
