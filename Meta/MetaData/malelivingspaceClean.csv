Ah now. You must have hobbies and interests. [This guy likes movies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/dvdcollection/comments/tuapw/i_decided_to_use_some_of_my_favorite_dvds_as_wall/) Or you could Google ""(favourite film) alternate poster"". Vidya? Try the same thing. Want something a little more refined? Go to an art museum, find something you like, and then research the style. Missing home? Next time you visit mum and dad check your friendly local library for things like old photos or maps of the area where the older children used to steal your lunch-money. If you grew up next to the sea, nautical charts are a nice alternative to maps of the world. When on holiday collect things like postcards, ticket stubs and beer coasters and frame that shit - I went to the DMZ and now have my [waiver, North Korean money and a JSA sticker in a lovely Ikea frame. ](http://i.imgur.com/RfYFwSz.jpg) Broke-ass student? Scrounge event posters or flyers from nightclubs and gigs, or ads from magazines - [all of these cost me exactly nothing.](http://imgur.com/sbGINrA). Go to a charity shop and stock up on cheap frames, or get lucky and find something cool.

Part 1: Dealing with Bad Smells

Your first impulse may be to spray Febreeze and call it a day.  Don't. If your room smells bad, you should try to remove the source of the smell before trying to cover it up with something nicer.   Otherwise, the smells mix and can turn even worse.

Find the source of the smell, and, if practical, remove or clean it.  The top three offenders in my apartment are the trash can, the toilet, and the sink/microwave.  For these things, I absolutely love the [Clorox wipes](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Clorox-Disinfecting-Wipes-3-Pack-75-ct/14898365) my local Walmart carries, although I'm sure Lysol wipes or any cleaning solution will do the job as well.

I've never had any musty furniture – I honestly haven't bought very much furniture at all – but I'm aware that it can smell bad.  Luckily, [Apartment Therapy had an article on de-mustifying furniture](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-to-clean-musty-furntiure-171736).  If that's your problem, you should read it and let us know how their methods work!

Sometimes you can't find a bad smell, or the smell lingers after the source of the smell has gone.  In that case, you can wait for the smell to dissipate, or you can help it along.  My favorite way to get rid of odors, weather permitting, is to open up all my windows and let fresh air in.  It's not just that it smells better; sometimes it feels better to be breathing some new air.

Part 2:  Introducing Nice Smells

Here's where I'm weak.  I am aware that some people like living with strong smells, but I had trouble with asthma growing up, so I tend to avoid that.  But, here's some solutions that other people have written about:

[Dappered.com](http://dappered.com/2012/07/cologne-for-you-home-tips-for-making-your-place-smell-great/) recommends using a [reed diffuser](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDKBD8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=dappered-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JDKBD8) to scent your place, as they're more subtle than candles.  When it comes to smell, subtle is a good thing.

[Apartment Therapy](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/9-ways-to-scent-your-home-with-98938) says quite a few different things – lighting a fireplace, baking and cooking, as well as leaving nice smelling extracts around.

I stumbled across an interesting DIY guide to an air freshener on [The Burlap Bag](http://www.theburlapbag.com/2011/12/diy-room-air-freshener/).  They say to put a small amount of baking soda in a container, place a few drops of your favorite scent of aromatherapy oils (search Amazon for “essential oil”), put a few holes in the lid, and set it out somewhere.  I've only recently tried it, and I got a bit carried away with the oil.  But I like that you can really easily adjust how much scent there is.  Not enough?  Add more oil.  Too much?  Cover it up a bit, or add more baking soda.  It's nice.

For the ultimate in laziness, and the method that I favor, just leave dryer sheets tucked away in corners of your room (or in your closet, dresser drawers, under your bed, the bottom of your trashcan...) once you're done with laundry. They smell nice without overpowering you.

Part 3: Maintenance

Far and away the most important thing is to clean your living space once a week.  If you think you can't do it every week, try breaking your cleaning routine up.  For starters, you can look to [The Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com/2012/08/14/heading-out-on-your-own-day-14-establish-a-simple-cleaning-routine-and-stick-to-it/) for a suggested routine.  Personally, I just rub all my countertops, etc. down with the Clorox wipes and vacuum once a week, spot clean as things get dirty, and do a really thorough clean once every month or so.

As long as it's clean, and you make an effort to keep it smelling like it's fresh (see part 2), it will certainly meet your expectations.

I'm very open to suggestions so comment if you have something.

**What Will Be Removed**

Bigoted slurs of any kind. If you see them, report them. 

Posts not pertaining to living spaces at all. 

Advice Animals/meme submissions (fine in comments). I love em too but there are more than enough subs for it. 

**What Will Not Be Removed**

Something you or even the community may not consider ""male"". It's a loaded term with a lot of connotations and I'm not going to touch it. You as a community will decide the feel of the subreddit and my only contributions to it will be my upvote and downvote. 

Shit posts. Look, I'm the trash picker here, not the editor. If a post sucks, downvote it and move along. If we can't self-police the sub then we'll have a much longer chat in the future.

Relevant [meta] posts. 


**Tagging**

In the rare occasion that a post is overwhelming regarded as factually inaccurate, I will tag it as such. I can only imagine a few times that facts even come into play in a subreddit like this but if someone posts a link saying a humidifier in your apartment will cure scoliosis I'm going to tag it.

1350573981.0	11oy25	Don't forget about the women in your life!  Tips to make your living space more accommodating to female visitors.	ScumbagPope	78	9	23	"1.  Place a trash can with a bag in your bathroom.  This is an easy one to forget, but unless you want her lady products wrecking your plumbing, it is important.  Be sure to empty the bin regularly, not just when it is full.  

2.  Consider the stench.  Invest in some of those plug in air fresheners or flameless candle things.  I prefer these because they're not as harsh smelling as incense or as worrisome as an open flame.  If you forget about them, you're less likely to burn your house down.  Probably.  I haven't actually done any research.  Fuck it.  

3. A clean mirror.  A clean house, really.  I say mirror specifically because we all know it is one of the first places she is going to really look for more than a few minutes.  It would probably be a good idea to just clean everything, especially the bathroom. 

4.  Beverages.  Bottled water, soda, beer.  Be a gentleman and offer her something to drink.

5.  Something for breakfast.  If your date goes well or your mom drinks all your booze and passes out, your feminine visitor will no doubt appreciate an egg or two in the morning.  Just don't do that thing where you ask if she likes them fertilized.  Especially if she is your mother.  Jesus christ, man.

6.  A dimming switch.  This is more for you, but you'll thank me later.  I can dim my lights from my couch, which is great for movie night or mood lighting.  Don't use this switch with compact fluorescents.  You will create a stone effect and I am not responsible for any seizures you induce because you ignored this point.


7.  Books.  Even if you aren't an avid reader, have a few interesting books around.  Books are a great way to start conversation and find common interests.  Women often spend a few minutes browsing my shelf. Bonus points if they're not about sports.

8.  Have a blanket on or near your couch.  She will probably get cold. You can play the hero if you have a blanket.  If this is a romantic interest, you should know blankets are magical things inspiring security and closeness.

This is my first-ever studio apartment and only time that I've lived without roommates.  The apartment is a rent-stabilized unit won in a housing lottery sponsored by NYC HPD.  I moved in on 6/1 and spent around $850 or so on furnishings and stuff I needed, so far: computer chair, bed spread, small white dresser, couch, bar stools, shower curtain, towels, housewares, cleaning supplies, etc. 

**Living room area:**

I still want to get an area rug and coffee table...thinking of something [like this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/155398726/metal-leg-coffee-table-multi-stain) for the coffee table and a white/off-white short shag area rug.  

I don't really like having the office area and TV (which is really serving as an extended monitor since I don't have cable) right next to the window.  Looking for arrangement suggestions if you have any. 

**Bathroom:**

I got the towels after the bath rug and now wish I went with another color bath rug.  I'll fix that once the one I have is run down. I've owned that CRACK! poster since I was 16 or so, taken from a Teen Center when it closed down due to lack of funding. Crack kills. 

Besides that, if you can recommend a cheap coffee table, rug, or other items that would look great in the space, let me know. Maybe some lighting suggestions, too?

Thanks!

Just found this subreddit and was looking for some help, I recently remodeled a foreclosed house and have been living with bare walls for the past 8 months. So I figure its time to start putting some stuff up.

I'm a techie guy, so I like more modern things. One thing I've been looking for is a cool wall clock. It's going on a ""Haze"" colored wall in my living room (close to beige in color) and I'd like it to be a decent size (say 16"" or bigger, if its a round clock) Any suggestions? I've looked at clocks and any of the cool ones I find are pretty expensive. I'd like to spend $100 or less if I could. 

I also have a corner in the same room I want to hand something on, I was thinking something sort of wirey and long. 

I can get some pictures up of the space if thats helpful, but won't be able til later tonight.

I graduated a year ago, got my degrees framed because, hey, it seemed like the done thing, and since then they've been in storage because I couldn't put them up. I now own my own place, and my mum has tried to give them back to me now that I have walls to hang them on, but frankly I'm not sure I want to.

I have two flatmates, so it seems kind of pretentious to hang them in communal spaces, but it kind of seems even worse to hang them in my room! My mum's threatening to hang them at her place if I don't want to put them up, and I'm tempted to tell her to go ahead... Are there standard practices when it comes to hanging degrees without looking like a gloating asshat?

As an aside, I am, indeed, a ""lady"". I'm gonna be doing up my place bit by bit over the next while and was really hoping to post here for input and advice as I go along - I really like the community and style here, and most of my place is going to be pretty gender neutral.

So [this](http://imgur.com/a/X562C) is what I've come up with.

I think lifting the television a bit may help, though with that design it wouldn't be resting on the desk anyway. And speaking of the desk, it's basically a place filler in my model at the moment until I can find one or two I can buy and join together to fit along that wall.

The main problem I have is about what to put in the angled gap between the slanted wall and the desk wall. Extending the desk to the slanted wall just looks weird. If I manage to get a desk that fits that angle then I'd like to put a cabinet beneath it for my N64 and Wii.

If you have any ideas please post them! My entire life in this room I've never been able to figure it out.

I'm currently living with a close childhood friend of mine in a big city who is thinking about moving to a new city. I'm 23 and still in school so my funds are limited. Ive now have had a roommate for 5 years and want to ditch a roommate and get my own place. Unfortunately it seems like a studio apartment is all I'm going to be able to afford in the neighborhood that I really want to live in. Or I can move outside the city and get a really nice 1 bedroom for about the same price as a studio inside the city. As a young professional it is just so much more appealing for me to live in the city. 

I am wondering what everyone thinks about living in a studio apartment. Bad idea? Manageable? Anything I should be really concerned about. I've only rented two other places in my life but I'm pretty familiar with the basics of renting.

Original post:

Just moved out of a crappy house into this killer new place, and decided it's time for my shabby goodwill furniture to go. I don't have a strict budget, but not trying to break the bank.

~~album~~

The first 3 pictures are my bedroom. The light on the wall is the only working light source in the room. What I have in mind is something modern and sleek, with a low dresser that would fit under the windows and enhance the look from the high ceilings. 

The next 3 are the connected study that will mainly only be used for listening to records. I'm trying to get my hands on an expedit shelf to replace the crates. The gray cushions on the ground are for a rocking chair that I haven't brought in yet. I think it might be better to ditch both chairs for some sort of small couch or loveseat and swapping the location of chairs and turntable.

Most of the artwork leaning against the wall in the bedroom and the posters in the music room will likely all end up in the music room or living room. Not sure what I will put on the 2 open walls in the bed room.

The room is roughly 12' x 20'. This is where my girlfriend and I hangout in the house most of the time -- watching TV, playing video games, etc. I often have people over for movies, hockey/football games, and board game nights. My budget is pretty open ended.

1. Thoughts on the layout? Should I leave it as is or put the TV under the window?

2. I'm planning on buying a new couch soon, after doing some research I think I'm going to go with the [Ikea Karlstad Sectional](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S09840644/) with the chaise. I want a sectional for the extra seating when I have people over. For the color I'm leaning towards [Isunda Grey](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/images/products/karlstad-two-seat-sofa__0115895_PE269808_S4.JPG) or [Sivik Grey](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/images/products/karlstad-two-seat-sofa__68161_PE182313_S4.jpg).

3. The color of the walls is too bright for a basement hangout spot so I'm planning on painting that a darker color. If I go darker should I stick with the lighter color couch or will the dark one provide a nice contrast against the wood paneling?

4. I will be replacing my TV stand soon. I'm thinking about getting [this one](http://www.scandinaviandeko.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/47721.jpg) once Ikea releases the 2013 Stockholm Collection in the US.

Should I get a coffee table or just stick with end tables? In the one pic there is a large bookshelf, that will be going away, what should I put in that area?

5. The artwork is bare right now, but I've been collecting [concert prints](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/p480x480/249114_10151486670203311_26995684_n.jpg) and will be putting them up once I pick up some frames.

I have a long curtain rod that could extend across both windows, but I've also looked into roman shades, thermal curtains and normal blinds.

I have most of the furniture (in the room but not in place) but need to buy a sofa so I want to see which one makes the most sense to buy and how to arrange it given the space.

The dimension of the room is 20ft X 13ft.  There is a fireplace and a slide door that leads out to the patio/backyard -- so I have to work around that.

I am going for a rustic/old world vibe with the furniture and furnishings (most of the furniture is from World Market -- except the temporary Poang chair in the middle).

Here's what it looks like right now: [Living Room](http://i.imgur.com/s4XMRd4.jpg)

[Option 1:](http://i.imgur.com/oBprXAy.jpg)

I think a good size sectional along the corner walls make the most sense.  But given how the TV is situated, most people will be facing the fireplace.  Also, the sectional will be off centered from the fireplace which may look awkward.

[Option 2:](http://i.imgur.com/Z13PBE8.jpg)

I can offset the sectional and align it to the fireplace.  This will eat up some room behind the sectional so might make the room smaller.

[Option 3:](http://i.imgur.com/5E7QBmR.jpg)

Really don't want to do this -- I can mount the TV on the fireplace and put the long part of the sectional in front of it.  The viewing angle will be weird -- crink in the neck.  However, this will also divide the room quite nicely I think.

[Option 4:](http://i.imgur.com/SBK4Kkn.jpg)

I can change the position of the TV and use the sectional back to divide up the room

As you can tell in the photos, the living room space is limited, and the sliding door that separates the bedroom/living room would prevent me setting up a flat screen there. I'm thinking I'll just have to put the TV closer towards the washroom and angle it, while keeping my coffee table and couch low in hopes to create the illusion of ""space"". The TV (60"" flat screen) would either be mounted with a full motion mount to angle or I'll use an ikea expedit single column shelf as a TV stand, move it in front of the sliding door so I don't have to angle all my furnitures for the TV. I was thinking of building my own galvanized pipe couch, but I'm having issues sourcing sofa / couch pads for sale by itself. Thought about using bean bags, but that's not really too practical when having guests over. I've found a rectangular coffee table that is height adjustable, but I'm afraid if I'll have to angle all my furnitures towards the TV, the shape of the table wouldn't work well. 

I'd love for my place to be relaxing (chill and cozy is the idea!) and minimal yet practical. Thoughts?

The bedroom is 8 ft wide by 13 ft long.

I've come up with a plan for arranging the room that puts a tall desk in front of the window with the bed taking up the majority of the middle of the room.  

https://planner5d.com/view/?key=91fd98eccc3f7236ff3b6d8b851d179e

I've heard for small rooms you are supposed to divide the space to make it seem bigger, so this creates a study area by the window with lots of natural light, and a dressing area closer to the door.  My main concern is the size of the bed only leaves a foot of clearance to get to the back half of the room.

Does anyone have any suggestions for improvement?  Thanks!

Reason being is I can't picture anyone really having much of a reason to sit in there when you could sit on the couch and put your plate on the table in the living room and eat there where there is a TV.  This way I'll have more options for storage.


1)  Do you think that's a good idea to nix the dining room table idea for more storage and cooking room?

2)  How would you fill the kitchen area?  What would a legit chef do?  What are some must haves?  I'm thinking a nice kitchen cart would be sweet.

Interior of the window measures 25"", outside of window including framing/molding measures 32"". Blinds come in 33"", so no cutting for the one on the outside of the window. I'd have to trim the one mounted inside the windowframe. 

Thoughts on which to mount where? 
Blocker inside and diffuser outside would provide the most privacy and light blocking (east facing window, hello sun) with the diffuser mounted above, still showing the outline of the window. Issue: must roll up diffuser to roll down privacy/light blocking. 
Diffuser inside could stay down all the time, offering a bit of privacy and blocking a bit of sun, with the total blocker mounted outside/above the window. Issue: rolling down the blocker covers the entire window &amp; wood molding/frame to the point that it looks like I randomly hung a painting.

I'll be buying a desk when I get to my new place, but I will need a chair. Preferably something midsize, so it need not have 15+ levers and knobs, accompanied by an ottoman and cupholder(s). 

Should I just go to Staples and see what's on sale, or are there some well-known office chairs of legendary-comfort-at-an-affordable-price that I should know about?

Also, I will be studying CompSci, so I'll be spending a decent chuck of time with my ass in said chair. I'm also skinny, so weight support is a non-issue.

And I have a big collection of art. Mostly original silk screen and movie posters. The decor in my room is all black, white, or Metallic.

The same is done with the shelves etc, so my art toys, books, and other display pieces pop out more.

What I really need help with is setting up the small living room and the bedroom. 
I'm not very good at picking out colors that mesh or work with a room very well so advice on that is also appreciated. 

Living room:
Currently, my biggest concern is that the living room is very ""blah"" - it has a boring colored couch and chair and the other furniture doesn't really go together very well in my opinion. Unfortunately, I can't get rid of any of the furniture. What can I do to make the room a little more interesting or vibrant? I want to add some color but also cannot paint the white walls. I absolutely hate the current colored mini drapes at the tops of the windows but again don't really know what would go well with the furniture that I have in the room. I also have a huge white wall across from the couch which I'm planning on putting up some kind of artwork or photographs. Also, is it advisable to put some kind of wall art on all of the walls or will that make the room too cluttered?

Bedroom: 
With the bedroom I'll be using it for regular bedroom activities plus work at the desk. At this point it feels a little packed, I'm considering moving the bookshelf to the living room if I can find a spot for it in order to clear up some room. Again, furniture in here cannot be removed. The red drapes came with the apartment - I don't really like them and would much prefer some kind of darker color that works with the blue sheets I already have (left over from previous residence). Lighting in here is a small desk lamp and overhead light, not including the two large windows. I'd like the bedroom to simple, minimalistic and calming.

Before I get started, [here] (http://minus.com/mMnhA3ZC0jE12) is the album. I tried to get shots of perspective, and if anyone needs more shots please ask.  
  
Alright, so two adults and one adolescent live in the house, and an older brother in his twenties occasionally visits and sleeps over, on that couch. In addition, the adolescent plays soccer and usually has several (5) friends over at a time, give or take. We love movies, gaming, and soccer, and really want to upgrade the entertainment experience with these three things in mind. We are resurfacing the floors and painting the walls a nice yellow with the hallway a possible blue (not sure yet). In addition, basically all of the furniture is going out in a house sale (we plan on that) minus the piano I believe, and so a new template is in place.  
  
I really need help in deciding the following:  
  
1. Couch/Sectionals and what color/material
2. Furniture colors and what to add/what to keep/what to replace
3. How to open space in the living room (I might put the TV where the piano is, thinking about it, how light works with that).
4. What to do with the radiators.
5. Prints/Paintings to add/take away and where to get them.  
6. How to keep everything seasonal-neutral (good all-year round).
7. Where to go to shop (IKEA?).

I used to work as a cook and I can tell you with certainty that especially as just a home cook, you will need a max of three types of knives:  

*  **An 8 inch chef's knife.**  

This will be the most important tool in your arsenal and the one you use for probably 90% of tasks. A sharp, quality chef's knife will make cooking a pleasure and set you back maybe 25-30 bucks.
  
* **An 8-10 inch serrated knife**  
  
This knife is mainly used for slicing bread but can also be useful for vegetables with tough skin.  
  
* **A small paring knife**
  
This one would probably be optional for most but can come in handy for working with some small ingredients.  
  
Get yourself a solid cutting board and a nice magnetic strip for easy access to your tools and you have pretty much all you need (although I'd also advise buying a sharpening stone and learning how to use it to keep those blades sharp.)

I am moving into a studio/loft apartment in the later part of July, and am trying to come up with some ideas and/or sense of direction when it comes to how I envision the layout/design. You can view the layout in the link I have posted. 

Basically, 778 sq ft with one big open room which offsets the kitchen, adjacent to my closet and bathroom, and encompasses the living/dining/bedroom area. I do not have any dining room furniture, so I am debating on turning the dining area into a office/computer room-esque section. I have been searching ideas on if I want room dividers or not, if I want to hang one of the two tv's I have (I am coming from a traditional 1 BD/1 BA apartment, so I had a tv in the living room and my bedroom), or not, etc etc. I currently have 2 couches, a coffee table, and end table with a lamp, dresser, and nightstand coming with me. The flooring is wood-style throughout the entirety of the apartment. 

One cool feature about this particular layout are the floor-to-ceiling windows which face east and take up the majority of the back wall.

1357688439.0	167pfr	Tell me what to do with my unconventional house!	TheodoreRoethke	23	8	6	"I just moved into an 1800's row home that I'm renting in an urban neighborhood. It's just me living here (Male, 25, employed) but my girlfriend basically lives here as well. I'm trying to get a bit of advice here because this is my first place on my own. This house has a strange layout but that was one of the reasons that I rented it, it has a lot of character for the money I'm paying. It's a two story house, about 800 square feet, not including the basement. I've included various pictures. Please note that none of the rooms are finished or the way that I want them, and pardon any mess you notice, I'm not done with the moving process or really settled at this point.

The couch is a Chesterfield that I had delivered yesterday. I want to kind of work with that, it's a little big for the room but I like it that way. I'm totally open to moving it wherever in the room, the spot I have it in now is just where the movers had set it. This might sound really stupid but I was going to put an area rug at the foot of the couch, I was thinking a cowskin like this: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60222932/ and then a coffee table of some kind. I want to get some ferns and things like that, I just don't know about the layout of the room, hard for me to get a feel for. The problem is that the bookshelf in the back corner is built into the wall so that kind of inhibits what I can do with the room, as well as the cellar doors, and the back door, they all need a little room. You can kind of see that all in the pictures. I have a surround sound system with 6 speakers and a TV stand that needs to go somewhere, but that's about it. I don't need a lot of furniture in the living area.

The kitchen is basically fine the way it is, I may replace the table with a smaller one, but other than that I'm mostly happy. 

Upstairs there are 3 rooms, the front bedroom (room with blue walls, being used as an office), the back bedroom (room with bed and closets) and bathroom. I didn't include pictures of the bathroom because it's pretty much set the way it is, no problems there. 

The front bedroom definitely needs seating of some kind, maybe a couch, art, something. I was going to get a carpet for it as well. Not sure. The bookshelf that is in there is not staying.  

The back bedroom, I don't really want much stuff in there. Underneath the built in shelves, I was going to put one of my Expedit IKEA shelves sideways, put casters on it and use it for record storage and put a turntable on the top of it, for bedroom listening.

1353786154.0	13q46a	Discussion: Computer Desk in Bedroom or Livining/Common Room	wehooper4	23	7	13	"Over the last 8 years I've had it several ways:  

* Computer and bed same small room (dorms + current setup)
* Large bedroom with a bookcase room divider between the desk and bed areas. 
* Separate shared ""office"". 
* Separate individual ""office"". 

Every of those was dictated based on the living situation at the time, and obviously the separate office setup was optimal followed by the shared office.  I'm about to move into my first solo place (no roommates) so a new dilemma has appeared: Put the desk in the bedroom or in the common area/living room?

Here is a rough floor plan of the place (ignore furniture placement): [Floorplan](http://i.imgur.com/rQXDm.jpg)

My wife and I have been married 10 years, and very recently I realized something - I've never felt like ""our"" bedroom was ""mine"" at all. I always felt like I was sleeping at her house, in her space - and even felt like I was intruding on her space if I had to go up there and get something while she wasnt home. Wow - I don't know how I missed whatever was causing that, I guess there were always bigger fish to fry and I never put my finger on it - but ok, we talked about it, and she feels horrible, never meant for it to feel that way and such, and told me to get some things to make it feel like my room..

Problem is I have no idea what that would be. Any ideas to make my ""his and hers"" bedroom feel like it's more ""his too"" ?

1350429213.0	11lirf	Awesome household addition: endgrain cutting boards		16	2	7	"These things are true pieces of artisan craftwork. They're useful, assembled with deep, dark hues of high quality wood, reliable, and lastable. Their care and maintenance is elusive to most people and so they often get ruined from excessive heat/moisture, abrasive cleaners, or *gasp* being thrown in the dishwasher. All you need to know is this: cleaning a cutting board involves wiping it down with vinegar, letting it dry, and giving it a running over with some low-odor oil (like safflower). That's enough to sanitize, deodorize, and condition the wood on something that can last for decades!

You'd never guess it, but leaned against the wall in the kitchen, it can look like a piece of artwork. [This endgrain cutting board goes for a cool $100 USD](http://www.amazon.com/Proteak-Cutting-Board-Rectangle-2-Inch/dp/B001CMRQZ2/ref=pd_sim_sbs_k_4). It looks like you give a fuck about your materials, especially if you actually cook. When I see a knife block with Japanese or German steel and a cutting board like this, I see a kitchen that belongs to a legit chef.

The impressive bit is that you can use it for serving too. Throw some grapes and goat cheese straight on the board, as is the French style, and it never fails to impress others who have an eye for things like this."	t5_2v70p	True

1350439600.0	11lucu	A couple of tips for getting artwork you like at a good price	MerkinForTheWeekend	17	1	4	"Contact your local college/university's art department, and find out when their senior BFA students are having their shows.  You can often find unique stuff you really like at pretty low prices (100 to 500 bucks).  Besides, you never know, the person might end up becoming somewhat famous down the road, and the piece might go up in value.  Granted, the chance of that is slim, but still there.

Likewise, faculty shows can be a good source of art at reasonable prices.  At many colleges, the faculty is required to show x amount of work per year, so they end up with a lot of work cluttered up that doesn't sell.  If you run across someone whose work you like, ask them what other things they might have for sale.  If they have pieces that they just want rid of, they might be willing to cut you a good deal.

Art fairs are another great place to buy work by less well known or up and coming artists at good prices.

If you run across an image you really like on flickr or wherever, contact the artist to see if you can buy a print.  You would be surprised at how cheaply you can get prints of photos you really like if the person selling is just someone who does photography as a hobby."	t5_2v70p	True

So first off, yes it's ridiculous to have two TV's (42"" LED on top; 32"" LED on bottom) on one wall. But this is my first place of my own, so while I can, I'm living the dream of being able to play Xbox while watching baseball. So those won't be moving.

The ceilings in my place are 10' high, so the top edge of the upper TV is at ~7 ft.  Looking for suggestions for the left side as far as storing electronic equipment: cable box, modem, router, Xbox - as most of the inputs on the TVs are on the left side. I've thought about a leaning bookshelf, but those don't seem to go up 7 ft typically, and the top shelf isn't really deep enough to hold much of anything.  

I've purchased this [cord cover](http://www.amazon.com/Wiremold-CMK30-Screen-Television-Cover/dp/B0015EA3NO/ref=pd_sim_hi_7) for cable management purposes, but out of fear haven't made an attempt at it yet.

Additionally, I have some video game posters done by [Ron Guyatt](http://www.etsy.com/shop/RonGuyatt) that I'd like to put up. I figure once there's two TVs on the wall, there's no such thing as overkill when it comes to flying the nerd flag.

I will be moving sometime this summer and the space I will be moving into will have this awesome 'man cave' space in the basement. I am starting to plan out ideas for it and feedback may be nice as I am in-between different ideas.

I want the space to be a nice media room and have part of it double as a work space for projects and research/study. I don't have pictures handy at the moment though (as it is still unfinished/being built)

I ordered a 60"" samsung that will be calibrated. I do have an xbox but I dont use it much and may trade or sell it or something. 

The color scheme I am planning for is blues and whites 

Wall Color I've picked out: http://www.lowes.com/pd_93707-4-CI196PEACEFULSLUMBER_0__?productId=3325020

I'd like to even put a semi-perminant bar structure in but that is a tentative, down the road possibly, idea..

The major thing I guess that I'm asking for is feedback on my ideas for aesthetics. I was considering what type of art would be best. Would white vinyl lettering with a quote or song lyric look good above the seating area? I was also debating about ordering a Fathead of something similar to this: http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=RCAHMS&amp;id=32092&amp;image_id=SC342304  

though I would find a better picture and make sure the space was balanced well. or instead, the fathead site has a white board that caught my eye. I wasn't sure what would be best yet. 

Also, I wanted to ask about the room smells thing, I read the guide which was awesome. While incense isn't foreign to me I am not a connoisseur.

those did catch my eye for the bathroom though.

and I don't know if they are worth it. it would probably just be cheaper to get smoker chips or something lol

As for audio I have a Big Jambox connected by bluetooth to my tablet that has sirius XM, so that will do.

still have to accumulate tables and some seating (though I will at least have a futon and possibly a couch)

so, do these ideas work? is there anything I should have in mind I am not considering? I find myself starting to peruse through different home decor sites trying to find what grabs me. Trying not to get ahead of myself.

*  Maybe a mini bar on the corner that just has that random cord for the TV?
* Accent Pillows? for the couch.

My roommate and I call this our rec room; we use it quite extensively as a common area for watching tv, playing with the dog, and practicing our instruments. The problem is two-fold: for one, the wooden floor is very slippery, and the dog tends to skid along it if she's not careful... for another, the room just doesn't seem complete without a rug in the middle.

I'm looking for suggestions on a ~5'x7' rug to go in the middle of the room; in front of the couch, under the chest, and between our two desks. The couch itself is a dark brown, and the chest is rosewood I think... the floor has kind of a light cherry color to it, the walls are a light brown ""mocha"" color with white trim everywhere.

We were thinking of an oriental rug [**like this one**](http://www.floorsandsurfaces.com/products/view.aspx?sku=9555428&amp;af=2247&amp;cse=2247&amp;gclid=CK6gndeHq7cCFcef4Aod5GEAjw), but I'm open to any suggestions. Thanks!

SlateHardjaw	13	2	3	"Have been sharing a bedroom with significant other for a year now and we're looking to replace a clunky dresser with a more robust dresser/wardrobe combo that can organize a lot of things well. We're willing to spend well for the right one and don't want Ikea. 

Only limitation is that significant other doesn't like things that look too ""modern,"" which I believe means too much metal or too sleek. Wood seems to mitigate this limitation. Current bedroom furniture is a hodge podge of styles, so will probably build style off of this wardrobe over time.

We both need more compartments that close to help tuck away our trend toward disorganization. So, a mixture of drawers, compartments, shoe holders, and hanging space is what I'm looking for. Sliding doors or doors that close over every space are necessary. Don't mind if the guts of the sock drawer are a mess if I can just close it. 

An example of what I'm looking for, functionality-wise, is on this blog, but the blogger fails to reference where she got the photo: http://delightfullysimple.blogspot.com/2012/03/simple-wardrobe-part-2-sort-of-tutorial.html

Before that I had a smaller 1 room apartment and before that an even smaller 1 roomer. 

I've been collecting my furniture since I moved to my first dorm, 19 years old. I'm 28 now. Things don't really match anymore. The apartment layout has changed, room sizes has changed, colors has changed and so on. It's could be a lot worse but I'm still not satisfied. 

I've made an album with some images for this little project. The first two show the current state of the room. The wide angle images mess up the proportions a bit but you'll get an average idea at least. The shorter wall (with the windows) is 360 cm wide. I have some paintings to put on the walls and some other small details to change, I've been leving here for a week so everything is just put in place without any bigger thought right now.

* /r/roomporn - Also good, but has a high percentage of ideas that are impossible to recreate purely by interior design. Definitely more in the inspiration category

* /r/diy - A good source to see how people are getting DIY projects done. They often deal with creating decoration, furniture, or living space renovation

* www.apartmenttherapy.com - Overall a good resource, but has a large number of ideas that are decidedly more feminine or not really ideal for young single dudes. The sheer number of posts that they have on a daily basis can make it a pain to wade through and catch the posts that really apply to your style

* www.houzz.com - This site features pictures uploaded of professionally designed rooms/houses. They are sorted by room, style, etc. When you find one you like, you can find others like it, ask the uploader questions, save it to your idea book, etc. It is a good way to find out what other people are doing that ends up working. Questions are typically answered, so you can usually find out what color of paint, pieces of furniture, and other items are used

Hi all, I'm a single guy in a 1br in New York and was getting a bit bored of my apartment's layout/design.  Any criticism/suggestions are much appreciated.  I'm going for the ""bachelor pad/contemporary/clean"" look.  I also have a few questions:

1.  Can my apartment accommodate an ""arco lamp"" seen [HERE](http://www.dwr.com/product/arco-floor-lamp-white-base.do) in either the bedroom (behind the desk arching over?) or the living room (maybe where the current lamp is sitting, arching into the living space, or behind the couch).  Love the lamp, just don't know if it would dominate the space.  Side question - what light options would work best for this apartment?  I was thinking of hiring an electrician to install recessed lighting in the ceiling for both the bedroom and living room, then I could toss the ugly floor lamps.

2.  Is wall-mounting the TV recommended, and is my TV too small for the living room size?

3.  Should I get rid of the ottoman and get a proper coffee table?  I love [this one](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/desking-tables-and-furniture/occasional-tables/noguchi-table.html)

4.  There's really no other way to rearrange my bedroom is there...once the full bed and desk were in, I didn't have much room left to play with.

* My studio has a drive-in closet that I comfortably fit my full sized bed, 32"" LCD tv, and a decent sized nightstand in, I removed the accordion style closet door and will be hanging a curtain or something over it.

I bought a bunch of nice furniture but my walls are completely bare! I need some advice on what to do to make my place look great.

First of all, here is a picture of my couch for context and to help you get a feel for my taste: http://imgur.com/DfzLK

Right now I'm only trying to get something on that big white wall behind the couch. That room has abysmal lighting so I wanted to get a couple of wall lamps from IKEA (probably [this kind](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40163882/), but [here is the link to their store](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/20503/) if you want to suggest a better one).

My idea is to get a big art piece flanked by two wall lamps with cords running to an outlet behind my couch. I like some of the pieces on www.mywhitewalls.com and the prices are very reasonable. I'll highlight a few of the pieces that I was thinking about.

I'd like to center the whole shabang on the wall behind my couch (the two lamps and the artwork) so I want something big but not too big. I just double checked, the dimensions of the wall space I'm working with is 103"" wide by 56"" tall. If I want to center it on the wall itself, and not the couch, the wallspace is 140x56 inches.

After this I'll get some deep red curtains for my windows so i want a piece that will bridge the look of the couch to the red room accents. Like, an earthy/ espresso and burgundy color scheme.

First of all, here is the space:
[Dining Area 1](http://i.imgur.com/8IbT4.jpg)
[Dining Area 2](http://i.imgur.com/N98sN.jpg)
The table that's in those pictures is gone already.

This is the table I bought to replace it:
[Christopher Table from Ethan Allen](http://www.ethanallen.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-ethanallen-us-Site/en_US/Product-Show?pid=386504)
I love this table. It's solid acacia wood, and the quality for the price is fantastic. I chose the dark ""java"" finish. However, I didn't like the chairs that matched it. They were just a little too country for me, and I prefer a slightly industrial look. So now I've been looking for chairs, which was way harder than I imagined it would be, because I can't actually look at the chairs next to the table I bought.

So here's what I'm thinking:
[Remy chair from Restoration Hardware](http://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod1870729&amp;categoryId=cat1830093)
I love the industrial look of this, the price is unbelievable, and I know it will last. I'm slightly worried about comfort, but I've sat in plenty of metal chairs recently, and I don't think that will be an issue as long as the chair is somewhat ergonomic.
Also, I'm thinking of mixing up the finishes. I'm thinking 4 Burnished Steel ones to go on the sides and 1 Gunmetal for each end (6 total).

So... let me know your thoughts. Thanks guys!

HOWEVER.

I have a large poster (28x40 approx) and a shit ton of smaller frames (a bunch of 5""x7""s, 4x10s, and some larger inc one 16""x20"").  Problem is theyre a hodgepodge of random size and style frames.  They have all been painted black however so that is uniform.  Print wise it's a mix of B&amp;W portraits, random art prints, color photos etc.

Will this design look weird if I put the poster in the middle, centered, and then used masking tape to block off a horizontal line extending at the midpoint of the poster and went above and below similar to this tip?  Or is that center line going to be too weird, and I should do something more random with all the pieces (keeping the poster in the center still)?

Floorplan inside.	kwalitee	8	2	0	"My wife and I are moving into a great little rental house that has just been renovated. It's a little small, and the layout is kind of strange, so we thought we get some ideas. 

Here is the floorplan: 
http://imgur.com/SQyMO9a

note: The living room floor (wood) turns into tile for the kitchen at the point of the wall, so there is some sort of dividing line there, just not a wall.

A couple thoughts:

* We like the idea of a couch with a chaise in the living  area, something like this (ikea) http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S29902853/#/S99894152 or with leather: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39877749/
* We have an armoir with our record player and records/speakers on top that is about  1.5' x 3'
* ikea malm bed with pullout shelves (in black-brown) http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wt3EvJ-fyt8/Ta86aIg9AII/AAAAAAAAA-Q/Cjmez7Ix9Ac/s1600/ikea-malm-bed-suite.jpg
* One bedroom (likely the small one) will be an office; my wife works from home. She wants her desk to NOT face the wall. we would like to have a pullout couch in there perhaps where guests could stay over too. 
* the front indoor porch is a little bit strange...not quite sure what to do with that yet.
* So the big room is left as the bedroom, and it's just awkwardly shaped and very long. Ideally or TV would be in there, facing the foot of the bed if we can. No TV in the living room as of now, which is how we have it in our current space too. 
* we are kind of fans of a somewhat minimalist style, with mid century mod cues. 

SO, any ideas or thoughts? Thanks!

I guess I've been very compromising when it came to interior decoration. It doesn't seem to fit my style and I need some change anyway. I've got around 50m^2 (550 sq ft) for myself now and by the next week half of the furniture will be gone, the bedroom will be completely empty.

Here are some photos: http://imgur.com/a/7fbCZ

Doesn't look like a mid-twenties student's apartment, does it? I guess it's the colors. I like the brown walls but hate the greenish ones (the colors in the photos are a bit of, it is more pale like in the last photo). I'm going to keep some brown and white furniture: dining table, chairs, sofa, coffee table, the rug. Any suggestion what colors would make it more manly? Brown/white+something combo or go with completely different colors? I wouldn't mind to get rid of some of the Ikea stuff.

The purple, flowery wall in the bedroom... It's probably the girliest thing in there but I'm afraid it's also the only wall with character. All other walls are completely empty. If I'm going to keep it I really have to compensate for it somehow. But how? To make it worse the ceiling height is about 3.60m (12 ft) which emphasizes the emptiness. I've always had this problem that I have no ideas what to do with walls. 

People always think I'm really minimalistic, but most of the time I just have no clue what to fill my space with. I like everything functional. I like things with some style but nothing overly cool. I get bored of art soon if it hasn't some emotional value. Ok, maybe I am kind of minimalistic. But I still want to do _something_ with those walls.
I kind of liked the greyish [industrial](http://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/1cilp9/looking_for_decorating_ideas_im_pretty_much/) (maybe I just need some metal?) and [futuristic](http://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/1cwkvz/xpost_from_rgaming_recently_designed_my_room/) looks (especially the mirrors and grey walls, everything looks way too dark though) of those recent posts but I doubt that it would look good in an old building with high ceiling and light-colored floor.

Just looking at ideas for my new apartment and really like the idea of doing a big wall of mismatched photo frames.  

Is this too girly?  I've been trying to find cheaper lots of photo frames on ebay but they're all painted white and a little on the 'shabby chic' side for a guy's apartment.  

So instead I thought matching colored square frames are more dude-worthy and organized.

My idea was to purchase (2x) of these:  http://www.amazon.com/MCS-7-Piece-Gallery-Frame-Black/dp/B007UOTKT6/ref=sr_1_18?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373900987&amp;sr=1-18  then a couple larger poster frames, and maybe a couple square record holder frames as well, but all in black. 

Is that about the most economical way I can fill a wall with photos?  I had planned to take photos from shorpy, the library of congress and flickr and get the smaller prints made cheaply at CVS and then just get the larger prints made at a shop by my house.

I'm 20 years old and living with my parents, currently in College. However, I spend all of my time at home in my room, and so I'd like to finally touch it up and add some character to it, and make it look nicer.

Any advice? 

First things first:

*Wallpaper* - I want to paint my room. What colors would be good? I don't think I'd be able to redo my carpeting any time soon sadly.

*Organization* - I just cleaned my room, but there still seems like there is clutter. My entire closet is filled and I don't know where to put anything anymore. I just got done 5 minutes ago getting rid of a lot of things I don't need.

*Cat Perch*: Needs to go.

*Window/Area above windows*: I'm clueless about this. I know it looks awful, but I don't know what looks good either. Curtains? Drapes? I dunno. Need some advice. I really enjoy natural light and I get a lot of it in this room.

*Pillows/Comforter/Bed* - I feel as though I need to redo this.

Any other suggestions are appreciated."	t5_2v70p	True
1356559898.0	15hj6s	Would appreciate some advice/tips on my space.	fromclouds	6	2	6	"I recently (read: 3 months ago) moved into an apartment from my parents' place; meaning that I did not own any furniture outside of a bed, a desk, and an office chair.  I've been trying to put together a space for the last 4 months, and am having only marginal success.  I have been lurking on this subreddit, and was hoping to solicit some advice.

Here's the space right now (or what I have pictures of, in any case).  I'm a renter, so would like to avoid painting / installing sconces / heavy electrical work / etc.

**The Dining Room:**

I don't know what to do with the big empty wall.  I have two framed prints that I picked up at ComicCon that I'd like to put up, but they'd look strange if they were the only things on the wall.  I am thinking about stacking them to the left of the doorway to the kitchen.  I also need to buy items for the table (flatware, plates, place settings, stemware, etc.) so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.  All in all, there's furniture, but no decor, which is the problem, I think.

**The Living Room:**

The living room is similarly sparse.  Obviously, I need to get that TV off the floor.  I know wall-mounting has its proponents here, but I am really thinking of picking up an Ikea media stand, [like this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20117674/) since I don't want wires running down the wall and I don't want to drop wires behind the wall.

**The Bedroom:**

Last is the bedroom.  There's absolutely no lighting, and the bedding is leftover from my college days... which was... a while ago.  I need linens and lamps, and was hoping for recommendations.  I don't have a dresser or anything, but I've got a walk-in closet that suits my needs for now.

When I came home earlier this evening, I realized that the default smell for my house is curry.  I'm a fairly prolific home cook.  Normally, my house smells like whatever I've most recently made for dinner.  I have a cabinet packed full of Indian spices, which have apparently been lending their fragrance to my abode.

It got me to thinking...  do I smell like ethnic spices too?  What can be done to rectify this situation?  If it wasn't spices, would it just be something else?  Something worse?  At least it doesn't smell like a rot or a fart.  So there's that.

I am of the opinion that the best smell is no smell, so I'm not looking to mask anything.  I'd prefer to just be odor neutral.

* How closely should the pieces in on one wall or in one room stick to the same theme in terms of content / color?

Recently I got a bunch of new LED Christmas lights to use for the common area/hallways of my 4 bedroom house, which I share with 3 other guys. We used some older ones before but half of them burnt out and we needed new ones. I also got some extras to use for lighting in my bedroom. 

Although it is nice that the new lights will (supposedly) help us save some cash on the power bill (and certainly are more effective in lighting the entire living room), we were all accustomed to the warm color temperature of the previous lights we had. There's something off about the physics of how LED's work that don't agree with our eyes too. 

I have them strung up around the outer perimeter of the living room, and leading into the hallway where our bedrooms are. They are controlled by one switch in the living room. We have frequent visitors and friends to our place and it's nice to have one central light switch instead of having several on and off and different times, and people don't always remember to shut them off after leaving a room.

Some reference photos: http://imgur.com/a/PUKLV

I particularly like the way they speckle the walls and ceilings. 

I am wondering if there are ways to achieve a similar ""warmth"" (currently the lights are white/cool in temperature) without having to compromise the ""money-saving"" features of the LED or having to buy different lights? I was thinking of maybe painting the bulbs or putting some more wall or ceiling decorum to reflect the light off of. Thoughts? Something simpler? 

**tl;dr** Got new LED Christmas lights for lighting the interior of our house, but they hurt our eyes and don't lend themselves to a warm atmosphere. Looking for solutions.

This is about the best shot i can get, using my iphone's panorama.  I have a storage bed from ikea, where the entire bedframe lifts up to provide storage underneath the mattress.  Also have a small nightstand and a small, taller matching set of drawers that give me about as much furniture as is humanly possible for such a small space.

I have a window on the right side, where the curtain is, as well as another window behind where the photo is taken so really my only space to put things on the walls are what are shown here.

Any advice on what I could do to make this room look cooler?  Right now it's just very sparse.

*Before you ask:  I live in an expensive city, make a great salary but hated writing a 1400$ rent check for a larger room.  So I live in a fantastic neighborhood in a $750k+ house and I have a relatively good deal on rent.  Plus my closet is huge (in the hallway) and is bigger than my room.*

Should I be looking at craigslist or other sites for not-apartment-building-apartments?

If I paint it, I would have to paint the entire hallway also, right?
What color couches should I get? Should I get a couch and a recliner? Couch and love seat? Best way to cover up the ugly carpet? Just tell me how you think I should lay it out, I have about 2000 to spend.

1354668116.0	14akl4	Does anyone have a Lovesac couch?	kirbypuckett	3	1	5	"I recently bought a house and I'm struggling to find a couch for my game room. Three years ago my girlfriend bought me a Lovesac for Christmas and I love it! It is perfect for lounging playing video games and it has held up quite well. Now I'm curious about their Sactionals (couches).

Does anyone here have one or know someone who does? They're pretty expensive, but I'm looking to buy a nice couch and it seems good couches run quite a bit. I'm used to Ikea and cheaper furniture. I've looked in Levins and a few other furniture stores, but everything I'm seeing is either boring or cheap.

Here's a link to the Sactionals if you're not familiar with them:
http://www.lovesac.com/sactionals/allaboutsactionals.html

This is the figuration that I was considering:
http://www.lovesac.com/sactionals/6series-sactionals-7cushion-sectional-chaise-ottoman-black-herringsuede-covers.html

I don't want black suede though, I was considering a different color/fabric. The Lovesac store is a little cheaper than online, that configuration above will cost $5,040 + tax.

For reference, here are pictures of my game room:

* One ""media stand?"" that has two door on the front, above that and open space that I keep my xbox, ps3, and cable box. One the top surface I have my TV, my modem/router, media player, and two HDDs with all of my totally legal media on them.

* I have a twin bed, beside that a small ""nightstand"" with two drawers, one medium-ish and one a bit larger. On top of the nightstand I have a lamp, and cell/tablet chargers etc. Under the bed, I have a two drawer chest that is almost as wide, as the bed is long. There is unused space under the bed and I haven't figured out a way to utilize it yet.

* I also have a small closet, it is very cluttered unfortunately and so is the rest of my room. There is a wide shelf that runs around the closet, this is where i store my ruck and other gear when I'm not using it. On the widest wall of the closet, there hangs a clothes rack, and to the left of the door there is a small three drawer chest for more clothing.

I am authorized to put nails in the wall, but it cant be anything too destructive because I have to fix the wall/pain it when I leave.

I hope I was able to paint a fair enough picture of what I am living in. This is my first post here, so constructive criticism is appreciated.

If any other detail is needed, please let me know.

My main goal in posting this is to hear about some creative storage solutions for clothing/shoes/ and just stuff in general. Maybe some decorative things also, but my main focus right now is making it more functional. Thanks to those who respond, and sorry about the wall of text.

My roommate and I (both 25M) just moved into an apartment with a wider living room, got a bigger TV, and got rid of some shelves. Just looking for some opinions on the new place. 

[Panorama of the living room.](http://imgur.com/5opl4lD) I'd like to hang the two paintings leaning up against the windows somewhere. [In our old place,](http://imgur.com/9KOX8) we had the one with the guitar over the TV and the one with the car over the sofa. I think the guitar painting may not look as good with the bigger TV, but we'll get back to that in a minute. 

[Here's a view from the couch as it currently sits with nothing on the walls.](http://imgur.com/KaE1VUu) I did the best I could with the cable management, but it's hard to hide everything with an open-back TV stand. The walls definitely need something though. I was thinking about getting a shelving unit to put between the TV and the window, but something fairly minimalist, like [this](http://www.target.com/p/dolce-4-shelf-folding-bookcase-dark-walnut/-/A-608712#prodSlot=medium_1_8) or [this](http://www.target.com/p/manhattan-ladder-bookcase/-/A-11110051#prodSlot=medium_1_3). 

[For size comparison, here's a picture of the guitar painting leaning up on the TV stand.](http://i.imgur.com/7MUGM4X.jpg)

[And one with the car painting.](http://imgur.com/MYJXK8b)

One of those might work if I end up with the shelving unit, but wouldn't be wide enough on their own, I don't think. 

[Here are both paintings leaning on the back of the couch, for size comparison on that wall.](http://imgur.com/NHuCkhs)

As far as furniture, everything in the room now is staying. I eventually want to replace the TV stand, but that's far enough off that I should design the room around the current set-up. Besides the aforementioned potential bookshelf, I'm thinking about getting [a storage ottoman bench](http://www.target.com/p/double-storage-ottoman-bench-espresso/-/A-10320236#prodSlot=medium_3_55) to put against the window closer to the TV as an extra place to sit when we have people over.  

I have a couple plants out on the balcony at the moment that I could bring back inside as long as they're near the windows, so a table or small shelving unit by the window is an option too. 

I also have some sepia pictures of London that I could hang up. [Picture 1](http://imgur.com/sIyW3P6) [Picture 2, with Sharpie for size reference](http://imgur.com/dS4D5N3). I'm not sure they'll be of much use in this room since they're kind of small, but I figured they're worth mentioning.

Anyway, I have some of my own ideas on how to decorate, but I'll let you all state your own. I'm open to spending a little bit of money on some book shelves or something, but would like to keep the expenses down as much as possible. Still, if you have some longer term suggestions that I could budget for, feel free to share. "	t5_2v70p	True

* Accent Pillows? for the couch. 

I'm also kind of lost on where to get these things.

I just moved into this new apartment two weeks ago. I've lived at my previous run down place for 5 years and never bothered to decorate or put up any wall art, but now that I am getting older (late 20s) I'd like to add some sophistication to my place and make it my own. However, I've never been good at decorating. Suprisngly enough, I dress well and have style, but when it comes to furniture, art, colors, contrast, etc I am clueless where to even begin. I do like moder and minimalistic approach, but I don't want it to be too cold. 

This is an open space 660sqft apartment. The floorplan along with the pictures are linked above.

I believe my coffee table (glass top) is too big and high for my couch. I am not sure if should get a TV stand or hang up the TV. I think TV stands look better, but it will take more space. Not sure what colors to mix since I have a black leather couch and brown floors. Can a espresso TV stand work?

I was looking at these TV stands:

Hope I'm posting this in the right subreddit.


My room currently:

http://i.imgur.com/lmX1jCR.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/RCe2Xdt.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/UjXwzeK.jpg


To start off, the bed needs to go as it's not mine and the person I'm borrowing it from wants it back. So I thought that I will get everything new and go with a different room style as I'm kind of bored with the current setup.
So I've been thinking and have decided that I want some sort of a nice clean looking modern bedroom, either with a mix of black and white furniture, or just black or just white (swinging more towards the black/white mix though) but so it still feels nice and cozy so I won't have to ever get out of it :P (kidding) I would be open to other colour themes/styles but will have to consider them and see few examples in a form of a pic.


But I'm having problems on deciding what exactly to get, and generally having problems putting the whole thing together. Yeah my imagination is really letting me down. Important info to note is that I'm a PC/tech geek and a massive gamer, so the room would have to reflect that in some way even just a little bit.
I would like to get a ""platform"" bed, either double or queen sized and need to get it ASAP. The current bedside table and chester drawer will most likely get put on ebay, and would like to replace them with something that would match with the bed and rest of the furniture. 


Computer desk will also go as I find it too small now and just uncomfortable. Not sure how tall the other desks are but this one is really short to the point I had to use old games cd boxes to put under the screens so the screens are at the eye level. The desk can be either white or with glass parts. Can be a corner desk but would prefer just normal straight. Needs to be able to house 3x 24"" LCD screens.


With the TV setup, I either would like to hang the tv on the wall somewhere or buy a small entertainment unit at some stage.
Really like the look of this one, either in black or white http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/Products/Living-Room/Entertainment-Units//p/MEMLOWMED140MDFBLK
or the full version http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/Products/Living-Room/Entertainment-Units//p/MEMLOWLGE200MDFBLK


The room walls can/have to be painted. I do have a permission to do a feature wall, just at this stage not sure which wall.
With that thingo hanging above the bed right now, I think I will be able to get that down if it needs to be taken down.


The built in wardrobe currently lacks doors, I most likely will be putting in mirror sliding doors in.
The window curtains will also get replaced later on.


After I have sorted out the furniture so it all matches well. I most likely will need help arranging it all, like where I should put the bed and the TV etc...


I really would appreciate the help with my room and what I should buy and any other tips etc. Need to get this done very soon.

Jabourasaurus	1	1	0	"[I'm not 100% certain this is the best sub for the question, but it's the closest I could think of, and actually what inspired the idea, so I figured I'd give it a shot.]


I have a very old poster that I bought second hand from a record store that I have been dying to put on my walls for some time now. Due to it's age, it's a little tattered around the edges and has a couple of small (&gt;3 inch) tears coming off the edge.

I was thinking of framing it, but while hunting for frames at the arts supply store, an employee told me that having it plaqued might be a better idea. They mentioned that they'd probably have to re-cut the edges because of the tatters/tears, but I kind of like them there to show how old it is.

I also feel like plaque mounted posters look cheap; I had one when I was a kid of a giant fire-breathing sea monster attacking a pirate ship, which was awesome at the time, but in retrospect was super lame. The only other things I ever see plaqued are those stupid stoner posters you can buy in the back of video rental stores.

Here's a photo of the poster in question. Ignore the booze bottles, the poster has been living in a protective tube dealy for a while now and I needed something to weigh it down flat.

Any recommendations on how to organize the room?  The wall with the door is about 9 and a half feet tall, you step down one step to get into the room, once in the room, the ceiling slants down to 4 and a half feet on the other side of the room.

The room is approximately 9 feet wide, but 25 feet long (In the farthest reaching area), you'll also notice that there is a small 'hall' or cave in the back of the room, this area is about 7 feet long and has a max height of about 6.5 feet, again slanting down to 4.5 feet,

Im not sure what to do with this area.

I also have a large TV I will be mounting (probably on the door wall).

The small box area in the corner is part of the bathroom which I don't have direct access to through my room, so that's dead space as far as Im concerned.

A couple months ago, me and a mate of mine from uni moved into a flat as we tried to make our ways into the real world. At the get go, we brought what we had from our homes as a basic start and just shoved it into our rooms. We then went out thrifting for cheap used goods to fill in the empty spaces to hold us over. 

Well, it's been a bit now and we have both gotten our careers going, we have come to terms with the fact that those things we brought in to get started are actually complete rubbish. We upgraded the bits we knew, the technology and whatnot, but when it comes to the furniture and interior design, we are at a loss.

That is where you guys come in! Attached you will find albums of the rooms in question. I am hoping you could peruse them and give us feedback on what we can do as far as furniture and layout.

I have a leather couch/love seat from Ikea that's about 2.5 years old now. When I bought it the Ikea rep told me to use leather conditioner every six months. I never did anything the whole time, but I understand that leather conditioner is necessary to prevent cracking and to make the leather more soft. My couch hasn't cracked and there's no discoloration but there are some grooves forming in the seats and it's probably time to loosen it up.

The seat and cushions are real leather, but I suspect the back and sides are vinyl if that matters. Does anyone use a certain type/product they recommend for leather treatment? I think 8-16oz would work, as it's a love seat not a full couch. I keep the couch pretty clean (there are no stains) but a cleaning probably wouldn't hurt.

Have no furniture other than a queen mattress (sold it all a year ago and spent a year with the parents).

For me, bed comes first.

Apartment is fairly modern ([pic here](http://imgur.com/o1wXGBP)) 

Anyways.. from the wall behind the camera to the window is 13ft/156in/396cm, and from the left wall to the right wall is 12ft/144in/365cm

Living room and kitchen and other bedroom are already furnished by roommate.

The deck outside is all ours; its massive. That will be a future post maybe.

So, I'm looking for a queen bed to match the colors in that terrible pic. If I go back tomorrow I will try to take a better one with the shades up and lights on.

Anyways, I've been looking at places like Macys, eroomservice, Z Gallerie, and I'm having choice paralysis.

I'm looking for something that will last, match the colors and size of the room, and impress the ladies.

You can kind of see the outline of the previous bed coming out from the left wall.

Price for me isn't really a concern as long as the look and construction will stay relevant for a while. Other than that, I'm all ears.
