#Mushroom Week day 1: just some backyard visitors. Handsome, well-dressed, sociable. http://i.imgur.com/VkQnj.jpg


Day 2 of #Mushroom week: A closeup of some redheads.
http://i.imgur.com/hsNuJ.jpg


For today's #mushroom photo, I found some fairies dancing in a ring around a tree in the dark.  
http://i.imgur.com/TJmo2.jpg


And a happy cappy Wednesday, this #mushroom week, day 4.  http://i.imgur.com/l0yxX.jpg


Lean on me, when you're not strong. #Mushroom week, day 5. http://i.imgur.com/yOG29.jpg  Carry on.


Hawkswings for day 6 - first time I ever found this #mushroom species, could've picked 100 pounds of them. Delicious.  http://i.imgur.com/FYoPc.jpg


To end #mushroom week, the most powerful fun guy of them all - amanita muscaria, food of the gods (and the reindeer).  http://i.imgur.com/6jfU3.jpg

1367532075.0	1dkvhr	How to make a successful ID request on r/mycology	thefrisker	49	7	7	"There are a lot of people with a great knowledge about fungi on r/mycology that will be happy to help you in identifying your find. Some of these ID's are spot on from a single picture, but often there is too little information to make a successful and accurate ID. Below are listed types of information that are desirable in order to nail it. Of course you don't have to provide all that in order to make an ID request. Just bear in mind that the more information you supply, the greater are the chances of success. Too many postings are fruitless when there is just a picture of a cap from above or a basket of todays harvest scattered over the kitchen table.

**Not more than one or perhaps two different types of mushrooms in a post.**

Too many different mushrooms in one post just adds to confusion. 

**Submit more than one picture.**

Take a variety of pictures to the extent possible: From above where it's growing, close and not so close, from the bottom, cut through, base of stem etc. If there are both young and old specimens present, get a picture of both.

**Where was it found?**

It makes a lot of difference for a successful ID to know whether it grows in Arizona, Denmark or Tasmania.

**When was it found?**

If the picture is not very recent, state when it was taken. It's a wild goose chase to look for a fall season mushroom among the spring time species.

**Describe the surroundings.**

Woods? Grassland? Were there any trees near the mushroom? If yes, do you have an idea which kind? Can you describe the soil as rich, sandy, chalky etc.? If it didn't grow on the ground, then where?

**Examine a specimen.**

Does it bruise or change color in the cuts? A distinctive smell? A distinctive taste? (Yes, its perfectly safe to taste a mushroom with your tongue as long as you don't swallow anything. But if you don't feel to do so, don't bother).
Texture - how does it break? Did the cap feel slippery/dry/velvet like etc.?

**Make a spore print.**
  A spore print is normally not the first thing you will be asked for, therefore it's not a 1st priority. However, in some cases it might be needed, so be prepared to make one on request. Place the cap with gills/tubes down (or other spore surface) on a white piece of paper with a black print on it. Leave it overnight, and observe the color. The black area of the paper makes it easier to detect a white or very pale print.

There is a post in the spam filter right now that deals with the cultivation of *P. cyanescens*, and while I'm sure the information would be fascinating to some of you, I believe that most of you, if you are interested in that sort of thing, know *exactly* where to go to get that info.  We have links on the sidebar, and this post actually includes links to the source of OP's information.  I understand that cultivation of psilocybin-containing mushrooms isn't illegal globally, but it is in many western countries.  

So what do you guys think?  Should r/mycology incorporate the huge world of psychedelic mushrooms as a regular part of our reading experiences here, replete with grow-op photos and teks and the whole nine, or should we quietly remove such posts, out of respect for the wider community?  I seem to be answering my own question here, but I wanted to see the discussion, if there was one.  I feel guilty removing this post, but I see no reason to allow it, slippery slopes and all.

Discussion?  

**EDIT** - I'm gonna let this brew for the day.  Please discuss.  Please comment even if it is simply to say yes or no.  Please upvote or downvote - express yourself.  I will make my decision based on what you guys say.  There are so few of us already, we should be able to reach consensus on this.  Also, mods?  Care to pipe in?  

**EDIT 2**  [**Here's the link in question.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/l93fm/another_update_on_my_small_annual_psilocybe/)  

I know to some of you this may seem like a non-issue, but having spent many tedious years participating in ""Kabenzees Growing 90 (remedial)"" at various sites on the internet, and having taught cultivation, identification and just generally having to field all manner of stupid and uninspired questions from peeps who just want to grow ""shrooms"" to slang on the streets, I have serious trepidation about moderating a subreddit wherein this is the norm.   

I must say, though, that although there is a little variation in how folks would like to see this handled, we all seem to agree that censorship is balls, and all things mycology are of interest, including silly stuff, deadly stuff, hunting, IDing and eating stuff as well as growing stuff.  It has always been fascinating to me how many myco-geeks were inspired to learn about fungi through experimentation with *Psilocybe* and its allies.  

I will be back in this thread to address a few more things, but for now I need to doff my wet forest gear and ogle my giant Laetiporus from this afternoon.

1338219474.0	u8sy7	Hello Myconauts	quaoarpower	27	3	21	"Hi Myconauts - Mod from r/spiders and r/whatsthisbug here. I have a lot of unidentified tropical mushrooms, which I post from time to time.

My last submission did not receive any [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/mycology/comments/u2aqs/identity_help_costa_rica/) and got downvoted so it doesn't even appear on the feed anymore. 

While I realize the difficulty of identifying exotics from only a picture, I would still suggest that the Linnaean classification system allows for *some* level of identification in nearly all cases. 

I know the r/whatsthisbug ethic is not for everyone, but if we are presented with a blurry picture of a black beetle, we can at the very least identify it as a beetle and tell the poster what we need to get the identification any further than Order. 

I know it's tempting to just be AWESOME with each post, and hand out species-level IDs of the ones you recognize because they also grow in your backyard, but I hope we can expand the limits of r/mycology. 

I also know from similar conversations with other ""r/whatsthis"" subreddits that there are huge numbers of proud and prickly ID-ists who don't like to be pressed - so please don't take this as a criticism or anything that might cause the gills of your ego to deliquesce. I'm fascinated by fungi and just want to know more about them and how they are classified. So, let me gently suggest that you folks who know things to Order, to Class, to Whatever Level, that if you see a strange mushroom, go ahead and ring in with a tentative identification. That way your subreddit can continue to grow and build its reputation. 

And on the flipside, let me suggest that completely ignoring a post and downvoting it, kind of takes the ""fun"" out of ""fungus."" I'm not here for upvotes, but I am here because I have scientific curiosity about the natural world, and I hope there are a lot of other people here who share that.

(proper crosspost from cookit)	robotsongs	26	1	12	"I was fertilizing my lemon tree just now and as I was turning up the dirt around it I found this. I thought it was a turd at first but then I realized it would have really hurt anything that pooped it. So I brushed off the dirt, sliced it in half and smelled it. It's the most wonderful earthy, fungal smell ever and it's most definitely a fungus fruit of some sort. There was no stem or anything, just this blob of fruit. 

So, does anyone recognize this? This is in San Francisco and it's been raining a bit lately. Any mushroom specialists in the house? I'd love to use this in some food....

Also, I use E.B. Stone fertilizer which says it has micorrhizae added. [Here's the list of the strains they add to the box](http://imgur.com/kl0lf.jpg). I know nothing of fungus, so I'm hoping one of you do, and whether it's possible this is just a fruit from one of those strains listed on the box. I'm sure it's most likely the case, but who knows.

Also, does anyone know of any forms of truffles that are actually poisonous? I might be mistaken, but I've only heard of poisonous fruits that have a cap/stem. Is this just poor information on my part? Thanks again for any ideas.

I feel like they are shaggy parasols or something similar, and they look mighty tasty, but I can't find my reference anywhere. What do all of you think?

I noticed a sad looking mushroom in this area about a month ago and checked the soil, noticing it was entirely filled with the mycelium. I also noticed the earth was really dry, so I started misting it lightly while watering my garden. Then pop, 4 big mushrooms come out. Really cool stuff.

Thanks for any help!

edit: If these are edible, what are the chances I could try and cultivate these indoors? I'm having luck with some oysters and I'm curious about cultivating wilds. Is that a stupid idea? I've never really considered it before. I guess once I identify them I could just take a spore print.

edit 2: Thanks for the input everyone. A more mushroom-experienced friend helped me identify them as shaggy parasols."	t5_2qu6q	True
