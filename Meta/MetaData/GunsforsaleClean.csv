1362711934.0	19w0lp	PSA: /r/Gunsforsale Those who have never shipped to a FFL	ChunkyJungle	59	17	32	"An FFL must have a “premises address” to which firearms must be delivered. He can also have a mailing address (like a P.O. Box).

Q: Can an FFL ship a firearm to an address that is different from the business premises address identified on the license?
Yes. Neither the GCA nor its implementing regulations contain specific provisions, requiring that an FFL have firearms shipped to their licensed business premises when receiving firearms. To that end, an FFL may lawfully receive firearms at their mailing address, storage location, or other address where the licensee intends to ensure safe and secure receipt of the firearms.

Source: http://www.atf.gov/publications/newsletters/ffl/ffl-newsletter-2006-03.pdf

You should also be certain that the person is indeed an FFL holder. It is not required that an individual (non-FFL) have a copy of the license; but you should believe in some manner (business card, website, storefront) that he indeed has an FFL.

An individual cannot use the USPS (Post Office) to ship a handgun, but can use UPS/FedEx.
There should be no indication on the outside of the package that it contains a firearms. Like Joe’s Gun Shop, I’d just address the package to Joe’s. Navy Arms ships their guns as “NA Corporation”.

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U.S. Postal Service?
A nonlicensee may not transfer a firearm to a non-licensed resident of another State. A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. The Postal Service recommends that long guns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun.
[18 U.S.C. 1715, 922(a)(3), 922(a)(5) and 922 (a)(2)(A)]

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by common or contract carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by a common or contract carrier to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition, Federal law requires that the carrier be notified that the shipment contains a firearm and prohibits common or contract carriers from requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that it contains a firearm.
[18 U.S.C. 922(a)(2)(A), 922(a) (3), 922(a)(5) and 922(e), 27 CFR 478.31 and 478.30]

Q: May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by common or contract carrier?

In addition, Federal law requires that the carrier be notified that the shipment contains a firearm and prohibits common or contract carriers from requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that it contains a firearm.

Never ship a loaded gun and never package ammo with a gun. Never ship ammo by USPS....only UPS/FedEx.

Q: What record-keeping procedures should be followed when two private individuals want to engage in a firearms transaction?
When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, the Gun Control Act (GCA) does not require any record keeping. A private person may sell a firearm to another private individual in his or her State of residence and, similarly, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee (FFL) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA-required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

There may be State or local laws or regulations that govern this type of transaction. Contact State Police units or the office of your State Attorney General for information on any such requirements.

Please note that if a private person wants to obtain a firearm from a private person who resides in another State, the firearm will have to be shipped to an FFL in the buyer’s State. The FFL will be responsible for record keeping. See also Question B3.

1361584248.0	1922xt	[META] Please be aware of some upcoming subreddit changes	stephen_j	48	8	26	"Hey everyone! As of today, I'll be helping out around here to make things a little more streamlined and easier to find what you are looking for.

There are going to be some changes made both in policy and in the way the subreddit is presented. I'm going to outline them below:

* Links will now be colorized according to the type of transaction (Color suggestions welcome).

* Links will prioritize the color based on the FIRST tag (i.e. ""WTS/WTT"" will categorize as ""WTS"").

* Links will fade once visited in order to make new posts more visible.

* Users will have the ability to sort links by transaction type (e.g. ""WTS"" only or ""WTB"" only).

* Users will have the ability to sort links by state.

* Links will now be given a small flag to indicate which state the transaction originates in.

* We will be cracking down on improperly formatted posts. Please format your post as follows:

    *Example:* [WTS] Colt AR-15 .223 [NY]

    Note that the transaction type is at the beginning and the state is at the end.

* Buyers and sellers can become verified by the moderation team and given ""approved buyer/seller"" flair. If you engage in a successful transaction, please send us a link to your post and tell us how it went.

* Conversely, buyers or sellers who scam or in any way engage in fraudulent behavior will be banned.

* If your transaction is completed successfully, please message the moderators with a link to your post so that we can mark it as completed. You may also delete your post if you wish.

* If you suspect someone is engaging in illegal or fraudulent activities, please inform the moderation team. 

* Finally, if you wish to discuss the state of the subreddit or make any announcements, please use the [META] tag in your post.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback. As always, we encourage you to read the rules in the sidebar before posting. If you mess up your post, just remove the old one and repost it with the correct formatting.

Thanks,

stephen_j

1367284568.0	1ddout	[META] Beep Boop. Hi, I'm Guns4SaleBot! Let me tell you about some new /r/GunsForSale features!	Guns4SaleBot	50	12	14	"**Welcome to the new and improved /r/GunsForSale!**

Earlier this year, we added the ability for users to become ""trusted"" traders so that you know you are working with someone who another redditor had a smooth transaction with. 

Last week, we took things a step further and enabled all of you to collect points from each transaction, further proving just how trustworthy you are! 

Well, it turns out that this was a lot of work for our mods! Over 150 of you have become ""trusted"" traders over the past few weeks. This translated to lots of time spent editing flair and checking transactions. 

Today, we are pleased to announce the introduction of me, /u/Guns4SaleBot! I am an automated robot thing and I will be handling transactions on the mods' behalf. 

**Here's how it works:**

After you successfully complete a transaction, you will need to send me a private message. It's easiest for me to understand you if you put the name of the person you traded with in the title of the message (in the format of /u/USERNAME) and a link to your transaction in the body of the message. If you get these parts wrong, I'll write back and let you know.

Once you write me, I will update the flair for the person you traded with. If you want to get your flair updated, you will need to make sure your trading partner writes me, too! Keep bugging them until they do it or get in touch with the moderators if they refuse. Don't forget to update your post's flair to ""Completed"" -- I don't quite know how to do that yet.

If you have any problems with your transaction, please get in touch with the moderators. They can handle problems my little robot mind cannot.

There are lots of more cool features coming soon, so make sure you keep an eye out for more announcements. Thank you for reading and let us know if you have any questions!"	t5_2sdvv	True

Thank you all for posting and reading, and making this community happen.

Since I've started this subreddit, a few things have come up that made me decide to come up with some official ""Rules for Posting""

1. Your state **MUST** be listed in the title. Forget to list it? Copy-Paste-Delete Repost. Simple enough. 
1. Dealers **MUST** put **""FFL""** in their thread title. Not sure if you're a dealer? Easy guideline: If you can't sell the gun in a FTF transaction, you're a dealer. Typically, an 03FFL (C&amp;R) doesn't apply.
1. **ALL WTS** ads must have an **asking price.** Whether it's the price you'll let it go for or not doesn't matter, let it at least be a starting point of negotiations. 
1. **NO LINKS** to auction sites (Action Arms, Gunbroker, GunsAmerica etc.) or other sites you have the gun listed. (AR15.com, Cruffler, Craigslist etc.) This reddit is not designed to be a place to dump your link onto, take the time to post a real ad.
1. There is **NO AD-STOMPING**. Don't like the price, or think the gun is a POS? Take it to PM. Everyone has the right to sell what they want for whatever they want. If the price is outrageous, odds are it won't sell.
 

Simple enough, no!? 
I will, for now, keep posting in ads that are not of the required format, requesting they be changed. If no changes  or additional posts containing missing info are made in a reasonable amount of time, your ad will be deleted. 

 
 Furthermore, my wife and I are expecting a little girl to come into our lives any day now, and my time spent here will be less for a while. ~~I will ""be taking applications"" for a co-moderator. Shoot me a PM if you want to help.~~

I'd like to welcome **Itsgoodsoup** as the new R/Gunsforsale co-moderator!

If you are an AR fan but like bigger calibers, this is the gun for you. Designed to take out engine blocks, this .50 caliber packs a mean punch. The Beowulf has been used to hunt the largest game animals found in North America, elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Or shoot whatever you need to destroy, the Beowulf doesn't care!

* Magpul MBUS rear flip up sight (OD green)
* Magpul rail ladders (OD green)
* Magpul UBR adjustable stock (OD green)
* Magpul PMAGS x 2 (OD green) (No mods needed to make these work with this gun. Holds 10 rounds instead of 30 because of the massive size of the rounds.)
* Magpul MOE+ grip (OD green)
* Magpul oversize trigger guard (OD green)
* BCM Gunfighter charging handle
* JT tuned and polished extra power buffer spring
* Enidine ""AR-Restor"" Hydraulic Recoil Buffer
* Barrel has been threaded
* Satern Machining custom ""Talon"" muzzle break/personal space device
* Factory metal magazine x 1

* Oversize dust cover built for the .50 Beowulf (does not come from factory with a cover)
* .50 Beowulf 325gr Hollow Point cartridges x 40 (factory rounds)
* Spent .50 Beowulf brass casings x 38

The more transactions, the higher your level!"	stephen_j	38	9	23	"A user came to our mod team after a successful transaction and brought this idea to our attention: what if we kept track of the number of transactions each ""trusted"" user engaged in? I had the idea of sticking image flair in like /r/stopsmoking and /r/stopdrinking to give it a more ""leveling up"" kind of feel.

Everyone who is currently ""trusted"" will start off at level 1, but if you care to link your past transactions to me, I'll give you the appropriate level. It will take some time to get this implemented fully, but I plan to have a bot running things so that we don't have to. 

Here's what I need from you:

* If you complete a transaction for the first time, you will earn your Level 1 Trusted flair.
* If you already have ""trusted"" flair, PM us after a successful transaction and include **+1** in your message (as well as a link to your post and who you traded with).
* As always, it is important for both parties to contact us. This helps us be sure that the transaction was pleasant for both of you.

This way, it will be easy for us (or the bot) to go in and increase your points accordingly. 

Example transaction:

* Bob buys a 1911 from Steve. 
* Bob and Steve message the mods with a link to their post.
* Bob has no flair and earns Trusted level 1.
* Steve is already trusted, so he includes ""+1"" in his message.
* Steve is promoted to Trusted level 2.

What do you think? Let us know!

1371173782.0	1gb67z	[Meta] You can now filter posts by state. Also, state flag flair for listings.	stephen_j	29	3	7	"Again, sorry it took me so long for this feature, but it's here! 

The announcement bar has a link to our wiki with a big giant table. To view all listings in a particular state, click ""All"". For only selling, buying, trading, or price checks from that state, click the appropriate link. I'm still working on implementing the selling/buying/trading/checking on a per state basis, so bear with me. 

Unfortunately, reddit's shitty search algorithm means this system only works if we assign flair to every post made. I'm working on getting /u/Guns4SaleBot to do it, but for now, we have to share that burden. **It would be immensely helpful if you could assign state flair to all posts you create/have created.** If you forgot or can't be assed like a jerk, we mods will do it. I am manually adding post flair right now, so we don't have a ton in the search history. Not much I can do until the bot is updated.

Lastly, I have removed the ""completed"" flair in favor of using the ""nsfw"" feature to mark completed posts. Please use that instead.

1300890095.0	g9put	FAQ for this Reddit. 	Mr45	22	1	20	"**Frequently Asked Questions and posting guidelines**


*How do I buy or sell a gun using Reddit?*


* This Reddit is only meant to connect the potential buyer and/or seller of a firearm, or firearms parts/accessories.


* **Post what you have, what you’re looking for, and where you’re located in the US in the title.**


*  Post title should read something like:  **WTS/WTT/WTB  GUN/PART/ACCESSORY (State)**


* **Make sure you add a price in the body, or what you’re looking for in trade.**


* Although not required, posting a picture (Imgur is a great and free image host) is a good idea. 


* Sellers can prefer not to ship a firearm out of state, but do an in-state face-to-face transaction. If this is the case, make sure you mention it. 

* No links to auction sites or ads hosted elsewhere. This reddit is not intended to bring traffic to Gunbroker/Gunsamerica, or wherever you have your gun listed on. 


* **make sure you check all laws applicable to yourself and the buyer/seller. **




*So I bought/sold a gun from/to someone out of state, now what??*


* As the buyer, the first thing to do, after the deal is struck and the details ironed out, is go to your local FFL, and tell them that you need to transfer a gun in from out of state. Your FFL will be able to assist you.
The idea is, that the seller can **only** ship a firearm to a FFL dealer in a state, so he must be sure that the recipient is in fact one.   

(Pro-tip: If the FFL is not willing to give out their FFL to an individual, the seller can verify the FFLs status on the [FFLeZCheck](https://www.atfonline.gov/fflezcheck/) using the first 3 and last 5 digits of the license number. 

* Once this is completed, and the gun is sent to the FFL of the buyer, the procedure for the buyer will become the same as if the gun was purchased from the FFL. Background check, call in, wait time, or whatever your state requires. 


Simple as that!

*A few more pointers*

** Be aware, there are states where certain rifles, handguns and magazines are still (or again) banned. If you have a buyer, and you're not aware of the legality of the transfer, research it, or ask. **

* Funds can typically be transferred via Certified Mail, USPS Money orders or Cashier's checks are advisable. While I don't condone it, ""discrete Paypal"" can be used, although if Paypal finds out you're violating their policy, you will lose the fund. 

* Gunbroker has a [FFL Search Function](http://www.gunbroker.com/FFL/DealerNetwork.aspx) for those who don't have a ""Regular"" dealer they use. 

* Example Bill of Sale can be found [here](http://www.kcarmstrader.com/billofsale.pdf).

With the gun I am including 2 magazines, (13 and 15 round), a soft zip case, and 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense.

At this point I am only interested in FTF sale to people who are legal to purchase this gun in TX and I am asking $850.  If you have a Sig Sauer P238 I may be interested in working out a trade.

Thank you and happy shooting!

1375833346.0	1jujam	[WTS] DPMS .308 LR with lots of mags! [FL]	Simplyeyc69	19	3	9	"With some regret I am posting this for sale. It's a DPMS .308 LR. I do have some scopes and stuff that are optional that I can sell along with this if desired. The scopes aren't very high quality though, more on those below. 

This .308 has seen some action and it works fluidly. I have a hard case lined with foam for it that will be included.

I have several magazines that go along with this weapon: 

* 2 - 20rnd pmags with mag covers. 
* 2 - 20rnd DMPS steel mags
* 2 - 30rnd PRO MAGs 
*1 - 5rnd DMPS steel mag. 

The scope is a GunTec USA 4x32 that I picked up off a friend to use on the rifle. The scope has rings and a mount system attached to it. The reticle illuminates in red and green and has bullet drop compensator lines. I would take $50.00 for the scope as it is now. The glass is clear and it works, I just don't have a system to mount it on. 

Along with this weapon system I can include a grip pod and iron sights for additional $50.00 as well.

1365868571.0	1c9u70	[WTS] Custom FMP SLG95 (military HK Contract HK91) [AL]	FeistyCrawfish	22	5	5	"I'm asking **$2000** for it. If it needs to be shipped I'll calculate the charges and add the exact amount.

Here is the breakdown of the rifle and what has been done to it:

- SLG95, desporterized with Navy G3 SEF Lower and Tac-Mag Release - $1880

- MagPul PRS-2 Stock - $250

- Bolt Microslicking (Dry Film Lubricant) - $150

- Wide Texture Forearm with H&amp;K G3 Bipod - $148

I took this thing in from an owner who had it since the and it was, and still is, in great condition. This used to be a military rifle that was then configured by FMP for export (with a welded semi-auto shelf). I had to do some work on it to fix a few things (Such as replacing the rear sight, and installing a Tactical-Mag release on it) and decided to turn it into a target and combat rifle. It has a Magpul PRS-2 sniper stock along with a microslick treatment to the bolt for a smoother action. It runs like a charm and has eaten anything I fed it, even Iraqi surplus (~80 rounds of test ammunition through it). I've got the original handguard, stock, a few replacement parts and armorers tools I will send with it as well should you buy it.

1365367884.0	1bvflg	[WTS]1919A4 package [FL]	Mr45	21	2	9	"For sale is my 1919A4.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/yqSlt)

I built it from an Izzy kit, using a KMP plate and trigger/sear.
Internals were machined by Iron Creations LLC.

It was originally built by me in 7.62x54R, but I changed it to 8mm. The only thing it's missing to run 8mm is the correct size booster. The .308 izzy booster is still on it. So with a 30.06 booster it can run 8mm, and with a .308 barrel from Sarco it can run .308. 
Included with the gun are a (bought new) Iron Creations Tripod and T&amp;E.
Also included are 1919 TM, some spare springs, cartridge stop, etc, as well as a spring buffer made for me by a member of 1919A4.com
Comes with what I estimate to be between 2500 and 3000 izzy links, a 5 round quick linker and a loader that works very well. Not built by me, but its' unmissable.
Just about everything less the driveway in the pictures is included.

I'm not looking to break up the package, and shipping is not included.
Receiver can be separated and shipped to UPS to FFL, and the rest can be shipped ground to your house.

$2,100.00. USPS Money Order/Certified Funds or discrete PayPal +4%

1333082863.0	rkhe3	WTB/WTT Medieval armor for ccw. [South Carolina]	godlesspaladin	17	1	8	"I thought that title might be a bit out of the ordinary.

Ok, here's my situation. I **just** finally got my ccw permit last week. The problem is that now the weather is warming up and all I have is a moose killing S&amp;W K frame .375 magnum revolver. Not exactly something I can conceal in summer clothes.

So, I'm hoping to acquire a pistol in the compact to subcompact range. As for caliber, I'm looking for preferably 9mm, but anything between the .38 .40 range is alright too.

So what do I have in return? A [kettle helm and a buckler](http://imgur.com/a/EEAqV). I used to do medieval living history, but I've since burned out on that. The kettle helm I bought originally for $250 and the buckler I had custom made by [François L'Archevêque](http://flarcheveque.wordpress.com/) an extremely talented French Canadian armorer. The helm is 16 gauge steel and the buckler I believe is either 16 or 14, can't remember. 
I also have an extra ash longbow with a 35lb draw weight.

I'm fairly cash poor at the moment but things are negotiable. We can mix and match items, or an item and some cash. More details and pics available on request.

**EDIT** Extra details: Ideally I'd like something with night sights on it, but it's not a deal breaker if it doesn't have that.


**2nd Edit** More items! Pictures [here](http://imgur.com/a/8H2Rs).

As I mentioned, I have a traditional style longbow with a 35lb draw weight. It has been kept dry inside for the majority of its life. The only time I had it out was a weekend here or there for an event, and never in the rain. It's linen backed with a wrapped handle.

I also have a polearm, or specifically, a glave! Also in great condition. The thing is 5 feet 7 inches in length.

And lastly, I have a **.77 caliber black powder handgonne**. It's a working replica of an early style gun. I usually used 70 grains of FFF powder in it. You need matchcord to fire the thing. I painted over it black to help protect it from rust, and put it on a oak stock. It has steel bands around the barrel to keep it tightly secured to the stock.

**EDIT 3** More items:

[Viking belt](http://imgur.com/a/Esk9M) (60 inches total) with decorative brass buckle ($35)

This ""pistol"" is perfectly fine in it's current state with the one point sling attached to the rear butt cap, but can also be easily converted into a SBR (NFA rules apply) by simply replacing the buttcap with a collapsible or folding stock.

I am looking to sell my lightly used Romanian PSL-54C. I am not the original owner but I have taken it the range  a couple times and shot no more than 60 rounds through it. The wood on it is nice and shiny with no real imperfections that I can see. The blueing on it looks good and there aren't any noticeable scratches, minor if any from its short trips to the range. The dustcover is probably the only item that looks like it may be imperfect since its a little dinged up from constant opening and cleaning (not sure why the Romanians made such a dinky dust cover). Overall its in good condition.

When I got the 8x scope, The previous owner said the bulb or battery was out so I never got a chance to try the illuminated portion of the reticle, but it worked fine for me without it. 

Breakdown:

Romanian PSL-54C , Made in Cugir Romania
Threaded Barrel with detent pin and removable Flash Suppressor
Belarus 8x POSP Illuminated Scope
PSL Sling
3 10 Rd PSL Magazines  (1 of the three has a little rust putting in a couple small spots at one time, doesn't affect it)
Harris Bipod Adapter

UTG AK Buttpad

Hey guys, my father's having some health problems so I have to liquidate part of my collection. First to go unfortunately is my safe queen and favorite rifle, my Tula AKS-74UN. It has ~150 rounds through it. Here's the specs:


- 74uLLC Receiver with Cyrillic selector markings, including full auto cut
- Bluejack v3.5 barrel with 1:6 twist rate
- Tula 1986 AKS-74U kit
- Gunsmithing and Building by Jayson Cotter at Investment Grade Firearms. This included the Envirotech finish
- Russian Improved MTK-03 side rail
- IGF Fake Can for those not wanting an NFA item. It has been blind pinned and includes the original booster, so if you want to SBR it, you can simply grind off the weld, pop the pin out, and put the booster on



It also includes the following items and add-ons:


- Russian Zenitco B-12 and B-11 handguard set. This is one of two sets in the United States
- Two 30 round Circle 25 magazines and one Circle 10 45 round magazine
- Bulgarian Peep Sight top cover from K-Var Corp
- RS Regulate AK-300 full side mount with AK-R picatinny rail attachment

I would like to get *$2150 OBO* shipped for all of this, well under what I paid to build it. This is about as good of an AKS-74U as it gets. I'm incredibly sad to sell it, but I would like my father to live a little longer.

I was originally trying for 1450 on Armslist, I realize now that's a bit lofty. **Asking $1350 initially but we can talk about price.** 
I can throw in 4 G2 PMAGs, 3 of which have ranger floorplates, and 60 rounds of Lake City green tip 5.56 if that sweetens the deal for you, depending on price.

**Rifle sold, post marked complete**



I've come on some bumpy times financially and need to make ends meet. So sadly today I am putting this M1 Carbine up for sale. 

[PICTURES HERE](http://imgur.com/a/MGsrq)

Details:

This rifle is an Israel Arms International model, produced sometime between 1996 and 2003. I bought the rifle with no sling or accessories, instead of a rear sight it had a rail and cheap scope which I have removed. It has a metal heatguard that can be easily replaced with the classic wooden one. Since buying this rifle, I have added the following:

* Flip Sight: $30
* 15-Round Mag Pouch: $30
* Oiler and Sling: $15
* 15-Round Magazines: 3 Korean-made (2 marked ""U"", 1 marked ""SY-B"", $20 each, $60 total
* 30-Round Magainzes: 2 Korean-made (Both marked UU) $25 each, $50 total
* Bayonet: $20

I have fired approximately 300 rounds from this rifle and it's been a joy. The only failures I've had were with steel case ammunition, it seems to prefer brass. Does well with FMJ and Soft Point rounds though. Great for a beginner rifle, plinking, small to medium game hunting, home defense, or reenacting if you're so inclined. 

For the rifle and all accessories I am asking $600. I live in the Belltown area of Seattle.  "	t5_2sdvv	True

+HK .45 or USP tactical
+FNX / FNP .45 tactical
+Sig MK 25 or similar (I know the MK 25 isn't .45 but I'm flexible for the right pistol).

For the right HK there is also some flex.  My priorities are full size and higher round capacity.  This is why if its a Sig I would lean away from .45 since the 220 is single stack.

1911 Details -
All original parts, manufactured in 1917.  Government model, wood grips are in great condition with no fractures or chips.  Original blueing with some standard muzzle wear from use.  Scratch on frame under the take down lever.  Comes with a military issue magazine (lanyard loop).  This weapon served in the Korean War after being purchased as a personal sidearm, which is where it picked up the GI mag.

These were gifted to me, to help finish my build, from a friend. They spent some time in the middle east, so they've got some wear/grit on them from duty. They certainly aren't perfect.

Unfortunately, the barrel I've got is mid-length, so I've got to get a different set.

PM is fine, I'm usually pretty quick to respond. Can get some pictures this evening for anyone interested.

Mosin Nagant made by Izhevsk, marked 1939. Gun is a reasonably good shooter, I get 3-4 MOA with Bulgarian Surplus and I am not a very good rifle shot. Stock and rifling are in good shape, crown is unmarred.

Rifle comes with usual accessories (oil can, cleaning kit, Mosin tool, bayonet, sling) as well as a replacement rubber buttpad and front sight tool. I also have 285 rounds of ammo, 105 of which is in stripper clips.

I am in Duluth.

$200 for everything.

Edit:

People are asking for pics, here's a couple, just remember it's a +4' long rifle, anything in particular you'd like to see?

The only thing that I can find with the rifle are

* The threads on the cleaning rod aren't great so it fall out after about 20 shots (a little lock-tight would fix it)
* The finish is beat up, but no major dings.  So it would easily sand down and be refinished."	t5_2sdvv	True

I don't have any slings or ammo, sorry.  
  
~~There is a fitment issue with the side-folding bayonet that came with the rifle. For some reason, the locking collar fits a bit too tightly and doesn't allow for proper operation. For that reason, the bayonet will not come attached to the rifle. I'll leave it up to the new owner to be a project of their own.~~  
**Edit:** I've contacted AIM about the fitment issue. It's possible they sent me the wrong collar and that they'll replace it with one that fits correctly.  
**Edit:** AIM is sending me a new collar that should fix this issue.  
**Edit:** The new collar arrived today. Everything fits and works as expected.

I have fired 200 rounds through the .45 barrel, and fewer than 100 rounds through the .22LR, both are in perfect working order and I have experienced no malfunctions.

My 91/30, all original parts, matching serials, stock shellac has been removed and a satin tru-oil finish to bring out the pattern in the wood. Included I'm throwing in 60 rounds of surplus ammo and a pair of stripper clips.( The rubber buttpad has been moved to the T53 so the original buttplate has been returned). Comes with bayonet and the typical accessories, I'm in Rochester NY if anyone is looking to avoid shipping, etc.

Bluing was in pretty poor condition so it's been stripped down to white and given a clear matte finish to keep from rusting, etc. Can easily be re-blued if desired. Purely an aesthetics choice to match the blonde laminate on the stock. If you're a purist you'll hate it, if you like the look you'll love it in person.

The bore is in great condition for one of these models. Tried to include a picture with the bore-light. No counterboring, shoots great in my experience. (Way better then my t-53).

I'm asking $150. Would be interested in any reasonable trades as well. Pretty much open to calibre, got the t53, no need for two mosins in the house, the wife won't shoot them! I'd love to trade for a pump-shotgun (20/12ga) really, but about any reasonable trades would be great.

Overall the rifle fires pretty well, like many will agree the trigger is a little heavy but it is still able to shoot well and on target with practice.

Houston area, clear lake/friendswood/pasadena more specifically. Willing to drive, but the closer we meet, the better and the more I'll be willing to pay. I'm North of Houston until saturday afternoon so if you're anywhere close to I-45 between Huntsville and League city, or close to Beltway 8 between Bush Airport and the ship channel/Pasadena I'll be passing through that way anyway. 

I'm 19, so face to face only. Stripped lowers are considered to be ""other"" on the paperwork so FFLs can't sell to under 21 even though it is going to be a rifle. 

I would rather have metal than poly, but will consider it if the price is right. Will also consider used if it isn't banged up too bad, again if the price is right. Don't need it bad enough to pay panic prices, if you know enough about firearms to have an extra lower laying around, then know what's fair.

[Smith and Wesson 1911](http://imgur.com/a/UtdjH)-$800 

Round count is about 250. I am the only person to shoot it, although I did not buy it new. My neighbor kept it as his home defense backup weapon but never shot it. I carried it for about a year, so it does show some wear on the backstrap safety. The spring is VERY heavy and so is the slide, so it has about 25% the recoil a glock or springfield has even in a smaller caliber. 


~~[2 Chip McCormick Power 10 magazines .45 1911](http://imgur.com/a/NYQnm)-$20 each~~ 

Rounds were not stored in these so the spring is in perfect shape. I used these at the range to reduce reloading time.

These magazines are unused, never loaded, but you can see marks on the bodies where they have rubbed up against each other. I took pics of all the markings, up to you to determine ban or pre-ban or whether legal for you to have them.


[2 Scopes - BSA Sweet 22 3-9x40mm IR](http://i.imgur.com/tF815.jpg)
Need to update this. Just realized there are many versions of the sweet 22. will do tonight when I get home.

UPDATE: This is a BSA Sweet 22 3-9x40mmIR (illuminated reticle). It is brand new, just opened the box to take this pic. I found underneath the scope in the box instructions, a lens cleaner, and replacement battery. This scope automatically adjusts trajectory on 36, 38, and 40 grain .22LR rounds. To do this, you need to plug in the right distance. It is illuminated green reticle, shock proof, water-proof, and fog-proof. Cheapest I have found the IR version online is $109. $95 shipped, selling 2 of them.


~~[Newer wolf ammo .223 20 round box](http://imgur.com/a/2i0IU)-$4.50 a box, 18 boxes~~

55 grain full metal jacket, steel cased, boxer primed, polymer coated. Before this becomes a thread about the validity of Wolf ammo, allow me to clear some things up. Older wolf ammo got a bad rep because they lacquer coated the rounds, causing barrels and parts to get gummed up. Acetone was the cure for that. Wolf has switched from lacquer coating to polymer because of the lack of sales or some other irrelevant reason. 

The bad now - it is steel cased, so if you use it in an M4 you may experience FTE, since the steel does not expand like brass. Up to you to decide if it is worth it. Also, it is really dirty. I mean like, you don't want to fire more than 400 rounds or so, that is when mine started to smoke pretty bad. Also, in an AR, you wont want to dry fire this or lubricate the bolt too much, results in lots of smoke and teary eyes.

The good - 22 cents a round. just requires a little more attention on your part. Polymer coated, VERY accurate. I have only been able to fire it out to 300 yards, no less competent than Federal.


~~[Wolf Military classic .223 20 round box](http://imgur.com/a/WMBeD)- $4.50 a box, 15 boxes~~

I think it is exactly the same ammo as above. Same FPS, muzzle velocity, and grain. Looks like Wolf tried some new packaging.

1335369304.0	srwj0	WTS CZ-75B .40S&amp;W Satin Nickel and H&amp;K USP .40S&amp;W	Nitron	10	1	7	"**SOLD**

I'm looking to sell a gently-used CZ-75B in .40S&amp;W with the satin nickel finish. It's a fantastic pistol (the finish is 100%) and I'm only selling it because I'm not a fan of .40S&amp;W and I've already replaced it with a CZ-85 Combat. It's had 108 rounds through it. Comes with two factory 10 round magazines, all documentation (manual, warranty book, unfilled warranty registration card and factory test target), and unused cleaning rod/brush. Missing the fired casing (might be able to locate it, though). 

Asking price: $500 OBO cash or money order, FTF in Northern Virginia with CCW permit or shipped to an FFL (see below).

Also looking to sell a police trade-in H&amp;K USP in .40S&amp;W. Again, great pistol, just not for me. Manufactured in '94 and imported through Sterling, VA. Comes with two 13 round magazines (one of which is a ""restricted"" post-ban magazine, pictured). It has some holster wear, so I'd estimate the finish to be between 85% and 90%. I've put around 25 rounds through it, with an unknown number before that. 

Asking price: $450 OBO cash or money order, FTF in Northern Virginia with CCW permit, or shipped to an FFL (see below).

Great shooting full sized handgun. I bought it used and I've put about 1500 rounds through it without a malfunction. Minor cosmetic wear on the slide (see pictures). I already have another full sized handgun and I'm looking for something smaller for a CCW, else I'd keep it.

I'm asking $450 for the handgun with one 10 round magazine and five 15 rounders. Will trade for a GLOCK 36 and may consider trade for other (sub)compact .45 ACP handguns.

Prefer face to face transaction, but can ship through FFL if necessary.

* Comp-Tac settable cant holster with belt-slot and paddle attachments - $50
* Galco Jackass shoulder rig in brown - $100

It will include the original accessories and factory 5rd magazine as well. The parts list is as follows:

* Carolina Shooters Supply conversion kit: Tapco trigger, CSS trigger guard, hole plugs (unnecessary because of stock adapter), mounting block, 8.5"" Ace Skeleton stock, Tapco SAW grip in FDE
* Tromix bolt handle
* CSS axis pin retaining plate
* An extra, low-power spring for low brass ""bulk"" birdshot (also CSS)
* CSS polymer buffer pad
* Tapco tri-rail fore end in FDE (original handguard too if you want)
* Mesa Tactical rear sling swivel (meant for an 870 but fit perfectly)
* Promag 10rd magazine (gen. 2, but they sent me the wrong replacement spring, so it's yours free)

The conversion included milling off the rivets so none of the holes are ""egged out"", assembly, some bolt polishing, and opening up the gas ports (same angle, larger diameter). I can include a CA compliant magazine lock (as pictured...it's that funky block on the trigger guard) as well for no cost.

I'm looking for $1200 obo, including everything above, and I'll cover the shipping if it's less than $50/the first $50 if it costs more (I'll get a quote if that works better). I'll entertain reasonable offers, but please, no trades unless they come with several hundred dollars...I love guns but I can't pay my rent with them. **Edit:** I mean for example, ""I'll trade you a CZ SP01 with night sights and 4 mags, plus $____ ."" ...or whatever.

I also have available as options: VTAC polymer light mount (pictured) $18, Streamlight Polytac LED flashlight (pictured) $40, MI front sling mount (pictured) $30, Magpul AFG (pictured) $32, and Surefire M900 (not pictured, like new in box, all papers &amp; accessories, both lamps, red navigation LEDs) $350 obo...I have a little wiggle room on the M900.

Made in Romania 
TGI Knox TN 

Included: 
1 Magazine 
PSO LPS TIP2 4x Scope 
Leather Sling 

Price: Asking $825 Shipped to your FFL in CONUS or ONLY trade for a similar value VEPR 23"" chambered in 7.62 x 54R 

Method of Payment: Payment by CASH or US Postal money order only. Will ship from my FFL to your FFL including a bill of sale. 

Info: 
I've had this gun for a few months now and have taken in to the range a handful of times. The gun is by no means a safe queen, and does have the typical wear for a used gun. Scope is bright and clear and includes both front and rear rubber covers. As far as I know the leather sling is the genuine one that it came with. I bought the rifle from the second owner and now I have to sell it. It's a great gun and I hate to see it go, but I'll eventually get another one down the road. Please let me know if you have any questions via IM. 


Feedback: 
I'm sort of new here but I can provide a link to feedback from ebay with over 400 positive transactions.

It has spent most of the last three months in its hardcase, has 255 rounds through it, and has been cleaned and oiled after every range trip (four times now, probably playing it a little too carefully).

Included are a pair of Hogue rubber grip panels and a simple magazine loader I bought to make my range time a little easier. The original box, case, manual and gun lock are included as well. The handgun is chambered in 9mm Luger.

I am looking to get an M91/30 rifle.  Numbers-matching is not important whatsoever.  The most important thing for me will be if it meets the following criteria:

*  Izhevsk-made

*  ""Accurate"" for a Mosin

*  Good bore (see above)

*  Round receiver

I am wishing to start a project build, and it will involve some permanent modifications.  This is why I'd like an Izhevsk since they are the most common.  I will be turning this into a long-range rifle, or as others (and myself to a degree) would call it, Bubbafying it.  This will include a barrel shortening and receiver drilling/tapping, so counter-bored and rearsenaled rifles are fine with me.  Stock condition is also unimportant since I will be replacing it (if it doesn't have a stock, I'll still take it).  Stockless would almost be preferred since I don't really want an extra laying around.  I will also be in no need of a bayonet.

I can easily get a copy of an FFL (I am not a holder) for you, and I can be semi-flexible with payment methods.  I can also offer beef jerky."	t5_2sdvv	True

The only real defect I can see on the gun are markings on the rails from attachments that used to be there.  Let me know if you want any more detailed/specific pics.

I have a nice Remington 1100 Trap model shotgun. Everything on the gun is original as it came out of the factory in April of 1978 (according to the barrel stamp). It has BOTH the 30 inch factory step rib barrel (fixed full) and monte carlo stock. The gun is in great shape, and being an older Remington, the fit and finish is excellent.  I have two 1100's, and the other one (also my first shotgun) just gets used more for trap.  $650

As far as trades go, I would be interested in Model 1903's or a nice Model 1917 (not sporterized). I would also be interested in a .410 Shotgun for skeet and a .410 reloading press. Cash can go either way depending on the trade.  A nice 357 revolver would be cool too. I'll entertain all trade offers!

This is Serial Number 16 of the special Cabela's Edition of the Witness 45 ACP / 22lr combo.  The gun is in a special brown (FDE) version of their ""Wonderfinish"", and as far as I can tell is otherwise the same as other Steel Full-size Witness 45's.

This gun is clean as a whistle (I have an ultrasonic cleaner and take extremely good care of my guns) and shoots just fine.  I am selling it because I got a MKIII hunter and I'm TRYING to buy a FNX 45 Tactical, so I'm making room in the safe.

Comes with:

* FDE full sized steel frame (Serial number is CAB0016)

* FDE .45 ACP complete slide

* Black .22lr complete slide

* 3x 10rd factory magazines in 45ACP

* 1x 10rd factory magazine in .22lr

* Complete box with original papers, bags, and cleaning rods

Condition of the gun is like new, 99%, save some light barrel wear.  This gun has seen maybe 200rds of 45, and not sure about the 22, but more.  The cleanliness of this gun will surprise you.  Always kept in humidity controlled safe, and always cleaned and lubed, and occasionally cleaned with my ultrasonic.

Everything is stock on this gun.  The 45 slide was replaced by the factory recently and it has not been shot since, so new springs and slide guts are assumed.  Barrel is original.

Asking $500, FTF in WA preferred.  I'd rather not ship, but will consider it.  Located in the south Puget Sound area.

Trades I'll entertain:

* Sub2000 in .40 with Glock mags

* Sig P938

* Mossberg MVP

* Kel-Kec KSG

* toward a FNX 45 Tac FDE

* Taurus PT100 or PT101 in SS

*As a side note, if you have a P938 for trade, I have a Sig P238 I would trade you for it, plus a little cash*

It is in nearly perfect condition, less than 100 rounds fired through it across 2 owners, all the factory accessories (scope rings, allen wrenches, key lock), and assorted ammo that I have left over (Winchester white box [about 20] and Federal PowerShock [about 40]) and one 5 round mag. Selling it all for $525. 

I need to sell this weapon badly. I'm a contractor who earns money by piece work, and due to lack of work haven't worked in coming on two weeks. I'm new at my job, and it's a new company. No one told me or expected there to be a slow season in the winter, and I'm a dumbass 21 year old so I don't have much saved. This and donating plasma are the only things that are going to keep me from going under until work gets steady again.

Please consider my offer. I've tried to price it very well. Share this with your friends if you yourself are not interested. I have never shipped a firearm before but will work it out if I need to.

Thanks for reading and considering. 

Nathan.

(Linked image is a small album. I can provide pics of it with all the factory accessories if needed :) )

Rainier Arms/Sampson Floating handguard w/ extra rail mounts

Rainier Arms Forged Upper

Rainier Arms Thunderbolt BCG

Stag low profile gas block

There have been only 220 rounds shot through this. I just finished the build in May. Took it out for a run and loved it. But haven't shot it since and there are other things I want to spend money on. I have roughly $1500 into this rifle with the extras. So my loss is your gain.


You can get a ton of info on most of the components at the Rainier Arms website. Rest assured, it's a good quality build. You will not be disappointed.

* 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells

This is a factory, used 12ga 28"" vent rib, light contour barrel that came stock with my 12ga Remington Wingmaster 870 pump action shotgun.  I've decided to convert the gun to a shorter barreled rig so this one's got to go.

This barrel can accept 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells.  It features dual beads on the rib (mid-rib is silver, muzzle-end is ivory).  It can accept Rem-Chokes and will ship with two (full and improved cylinder, both safe with steel shot).  I'm also including the choke wrench.

The barrel is blued and polished and is about 90-95%.

Brand new. Never fired. I bought to make a SBR project and am unable to finish. I have a faux suppressor on order so that this can be used (legally) with an HK stock (able to be bolted on with no modification). I will include that with the sale once it arrives.

Comes with 1 brand new factory magazine and 5 lightly used HK magazines. Includes the OEM hard case (and 80 rounds of ammo if local).

This is registered as a pistol and will require an FFL transfer. I will meet within 30 mins of the East Suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA. If you do not have a preferred FFL, I have one that does $20 transfers and is available for appointments. I can also have this shipped to your FFL at the buyer's expense.

Asking $1400 which is not even break even with the ammo, mags, and faux suppressor.

**For trade:**  [Remington 700 .308 SPS Tactical AAC-SD](http://i.imgur.com/y18Df.jpg) with the following:

* Bell and Carlson A5 stock

* Millett TRS-1, 30mm, 4-16x 50mm, 1/10 Mil, Green Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle

* Burris 30mm Xtreme Tactical Rings

* EGW 20 MOA base

* Harris S-BRM 6""-9"" bipod with Alpha Bravo bipod lock

* KRG Bolt Knob

* JP Enterprises Muzzle Brake/Compensator

**Other Notes:**

* I have $1600+ into the gun.

* Approximately 200 rounds down the tube.  I mostly shot handloads (168 &amp; 175 SMK's).

* I can't comment too much on the details of its accuracy as I am/was just a beginner to long-range shooting.  However, I took it out to 440 yards and could hit 6"" diameter balloons fairly easily.  I don't have any exact MOA data.

* I have the original Hogue stock, never used.  I can throw it in with it.  Or if you are wanting to go with a stock other than the B&amp;C, I could install the Hogue and keep the B&amp;C (and lower the price).  I doubt I'd have too much trouble getting rid of the A5 by itself.

* I'm willing to ship.  Contact me about FTF options.  

* I have positive feedback on snipershide.com, ar15.com, and eBay.


**Wanted:**  I am really only interested in a few things, but will listen to and consider all offers.  I'm not really looking for another bolt action rifle or any shotguns, as I'm really more into semi-auto handguns or MAYBE an AR or an AK.  I already have an AR, but will still listen to offers.  While I'll consider many guns, I'd love to find one of the following:

* Desert Eagle, any finish and any of the three calibers.  Seems like this could be close to a straight up trade.
* CZ's.  A CZ 75 of some sort + cash if necessary or I'd love to find a CZ 97B.  If someone has a CZ 75 with the .22 Kadet kit, that would be awesome.
* I would consider a Glock + cash.  Preference would be a standard size or compact and not the subcompacts.
* Beretta 92 with the INOX finish.  I like all 92's, 96's and M9's though.
* Ruger 77/357 or MAYBE a 77/17.
* A nice .22 caliber AR isn't out of the question either.
* I'd also consider a pair of handguns to avoid the ""+ cash"" part, even a pair of Glocks or something like that.  Some other combination might be possible too (like a 22/45 and a CZ-75)

I am looking for the [above stated gun](http://i.imgur.com/B4R1NwA.jpg). I saw one at a local gun store a couple weeks back and absolutely fell in love with it. It just felt *right* in my hands, you know? Anyway, I wasn't sure if I was going to get it, so I went to dinner with a couple friends to think it over. Well, I decided to get it and went back to the gun store, and wouldn't you know it?? It had been sold. :(

The store I visited has been *incredibly* cool with prices since all of this price-hiking stuff has been going on. They had the gun marked at $650, so I'd really like to get it around that price. I am on a waiting list for it at the store, but he is not sure when he will get another in.

One of the finest semi-auto handguns made by Smith &amp; Wesson, the Model 52 is chambered for .38 Special Mid-Range (.38 wadcutter), and it was designed for competition target shooting – to that end it has a fully-adjustable rear sight, a high Partridge front sight, and one of the smoothest factory actions you will find on any semi-auto pistol. The pistol has a shiny blue factory finish, and checkered wooden factory grips with silver colored S&amp;W medallions. The pistol has a few really tiny service marks, and the grips almost look new – overall condition is a nice 95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and as mentioned, trigger pull is very smooth. This Model 52 is a nice find for both the Shooter and the Collector, it’s a gun you will really enjoy owning.  2 5-shot magazines are included.

I love this gun, but I've got back problems and had to get something lighter for carry.

I've fired about 1,000+/- rounds without a single issue (this is probably much higher than reality, but I thought I should round up rather than down). I also spent way too long polishing the barrel because I hated the way the coating scratched off from the chamber. She has a little bit of holster wear, but she is in great shape.

I would like to sell this as a package. I'm asking **$460**. I am also including prices for individual items, but I won't break it up for 3 days. PM me if you want particular items, and, if this doesn't sell as a package, it's yours.

I would like to sell the gun, whether in the package or alone, FTF to a Georgia Weapons License holder. I am currently unable to drive due to medical issues, so I would like to do it in Gwinnett if possible. I will ship, but I really would prefer not to. I will provide a bill of sale if requested.

Package includes:

* XD9 Sub Compact
* 4x 13rd magazines
* 3x 16rd magazines with grip extensions
* original XD Gear (Mag Pouch, Mag Loader, Holster, Lock, Brush)
* 1x additional XD Gear Mag Pouch
* ~~Comp-Tac Infidel IWB Holster with unattached Moleskin (I never bothered putting it on)~~
* Approximately 30 rounds of Winchester NATO Loads

Individual prices:

* XD9 Sub Compact (with 1x13rd mag, 1x16rd mag &amp; XD Gear) - $375
* 13rd magazines - $15 each
* 16rd magazines with grip extensions - $25 each
* XD Gear Mag Pouch - $5

I also have the original Beretta stock, manuals and a set of speedloader tubes and pouch. I have *never* used the speedloaders and have no idea if they work with this gun, I think they are intended for the Benelli M1, but good luck with them!

[http://imgur.com/NLJkT](http://imgur.com/NLJkT)

Remington 1100:  This is a 2 3/4"" 12GA 1100 with a bead ""FULL"" barrel cut down to 22"" with a brass bead installed.  It has a Remington factory +2 extension, Ram-line youth synthetic stock set, Remington 1100 Competition Master shell lifter with the big bolt release button, GG&amp;G side sling mount and a Streamlight flashlight mount.  The whole thing (minus the magazine extension tube) was sandblasted, parkerized and painted in Brownells black moly-resin for a tough finish.  The Remington tube was added after I refinished it and is still in bare parkerizing.  Spares included: extra o-ring gas seals, 2 +2 Remington magazine springs, and a spare bolt handle.

The barrel is longer than the extension because I had it cut off even with the Choate magazine extension it was wearing previously, which was replaced because it was cheap and crappy.

Gun runs great, a soft recoiling tubular claymore that tightly patterns buckshot.

For an additional $150 I can include a 1100 2 3/4"" 26"" VR MOD barrel that was also parkerized and painted in grey moly-resin, plus a kind of beat Remington wood stock set, a standard length magazine spring and a stock magazine tube spring cap.  Two guns for the price of 1.25!

It's so new that these are the original batteries, I had to take it off the rifle it was on to ""go featureless"" :/ (thanks California...) **$350 OBO shipped**

**Barska multi reticle red dot sight:** Like new in box also, all papers, extra battery, cleaning cloth, etc included. Mounts to a weaver rail or 1913 rail, and can switch between 4 reticles. Was on my S&amp;W 22A, works just fine, but sits too high on the pistol for my taste. You can see $50 on the tag, save yourself the ten bucks and the tax. **$40 OBO shipped --- SOLD**

**Primary Arms Ultimate Weapon Light:** Once more, like new in box (with one small nick in it), everything included. Bright white spot, two tail caps, removable mounting base, also still on the original batteries. I just can't figure out a way to mount it that works for me on my Saiga 12 hand guard. They're $80 new, for this lightly used one call it **SOLD &amp; SHIPPED**

**3"" sun shade for 40mm Leupold scopes:** Again, like new in box (the packaging isn't pictured, but I have it if you want it). It was on the Leupold Mark AR on my SPR build; I had my iron sights at the 1:30 position and had to lose the sun shade when I put them back at 12 o'clock (with a longer hand guard it'd work at 12 o'clock though). **SOLD**

**Magpul cheek rest for MOE and CTR stocks:** I don't remember the height of this one, but it's not the tallest nor the shortest (so it's ""medium"" I guess). Just don't need it. **$10 OBO shipped or $5 with something else --- SOLD**

**Mid length and carbine length hand guards:** Both are like new, with no packaging; the carbine length ones came off an RRA, the mid length from a CMMG. Both of them have heat shields. **$15 OBO shipped for either pair**

**AR flash hider, 5/8""-24 threaded:** Never shot through, suitable for 6.8mm, 7.62mm, and 9mm *as long as the threads match.* This has cuts all the way around, unlike an A2 birdcage. **$20 OBO shipped**

The pictures are more or less in the order I posted the items. Shipping I'll cover as long as it's in the lower 48, otherwise we'll work it out.

I don't give a shit how old it is.

I don't give a shit if the barrel is shot out, bent, has a bad crown, whatever.

I don't give a shit what shape the furniture is in.

All I care about is that the receiver is serviceable, because that's all I intend to use.

Since all I care about is the receiver, I can't justify buying a brand new rifle from one of my distributors and stripping it.

And I haven't had any true beaters come into my shop lately.

The price range I'm looking at is maybe 30-40 bucks (plus shipping, of course), tops.

So if you have a beater 10/22 collecting dust in your garage or under your pickup seat, and want to make a quick buck, send me a PM and let's do this shit.
