Alright from this point on you send me $20 on paypal each month to post, that is all. No? Ok fine.

In order to streamline the sub in wake of us adding so many new bees in this trap and to make things easier on me ^^and ^^the ^^other ^^mods ^^who ^^hit ^^me ^^when ^^you ^^go ^^home... I would like everyone to read these over and PLEASE start adhering to these rules and guidelines. This will make our job easier and will allow us to start delivering new content for you much quicker and simpler, it will also allow the sub to run better, all of which benefit you and make things a little easier on us. I will give this a week or so but I will start removing posts and asking them to be tagged properly after a bit so please pay attention.

**RULES:**

* This is NOT the place for EDM based trap. Please take anything in that vein to /r/trap. Before you guys get all WOLVERINES on this our creator, no not Jesus, /u/fuzzy_dunnlop mods both subs so keep the drama down

* No personal attacks. You guys can argue but let's not stoop to calling each other faggots and other insensitive stuff, there's no need for it. Use your big people words.

* People dancing poorly to Chief Keef songs really isn't content, come on. 

* Read the sidebar to see specifically what types of music go here and a big comprehensive list of other subreddits for stuff you may find is better suited for your post


**NEW POSTING GUIDELINES:**

* All song posts are to be [artist] - [song]. [Here's an example of a post that will be removed in the future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1g0ewn/ugly_mane_with_another_banger/) Only use the [FRESH], [MIXTAPE] or day appropriate tags.

* Use [MIXTAPE] for mixtape download posts. This will help me as I group recent releases to make threads for and give posters credit for posting them. 

* Do you want to post non music content? Great, just make sure it follows the general theme of the sub. No memes or low content posting and we'll be doing a monthly sidebar contest soon where you can post your whacky pictures in. If you have an interesting picture or documentary or article PLEASE DO post it. [Something like this Vice post is a good example of an interesting video that isn't music related.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1fztf6/vice_hbo_s01e09_chiraq/). 

**ACCEPTABLE TAGS**

[FRESH], [MIXTAPE], [MEMPHIS MONDAYS], [TEXAS TUESDAYS], [WAVY WEDNESDAYS] 

Do not stray from these tags your posts will simply be removed, you can resubmit them afterwards but you need to read the rules which are now stickied at the very top of this sub as well as linked in the sidebar, don't be a victim of ignorance :)

Read it two times, absorb it, let my words wash over you. We're not asking a lot just for a little order which will make it easier to find and index stuff instead of searching through tons of posts. Remember that Monday is [MEMPHIS MONDAYS] and Tuesday is [TEXAS TUESDAYS], you don't have to post content exclusive to these cities on those days but feel free to post some older hits from these areas. As always we value feedback and suggestions from you guys, this is your community so help us make it better for you, leave your comments below and we will get this thread stickied or I'm going to tell the NSA what dhaft has been saying about them behind their backs.

The results are in for the first ever /r/trapmuzik Essential Albums vote! Remember where you were when Flockaveli got on an Essentials List, this is historic. I posted the top 20 by votes so if your album didn't make it or you don't agree with a selection that's democracy. For the most part this went well and you all listened, in the future any EDM trap stuff goes in /r/trap, so direct all your TNGHT and such there. 

Voting for Essential Mixtapes will be up next within the next few days so get your Datpiff on. I've included links to full albums via Youtube or Grooveshark alphabetically listed because I have crippling OCD! The Lil Boosie entry I could not find a proper full version so I went with the best option, if anyone can find a true one or make one I will edit it into this list but you at least get most of that album. 

Thoughts and feedback? Leave it below but don't try to vote because the vote is done like Paul Ryan's 15 minutes of fame. Remember to check the sidebar for your Essentials List and your community made Artist Guides to level up your trap game.

/u/BigWicked was cool enough to make a spotify playlist of the albums for easy listening as well as the grooveshark and youtube links that are up so thanks to him for his good deeds. [You can find that here.](http://open.spotify.com/user/121560241/playlist/3d9NNvB3nNVMm4WjL83Oel)

There are links to each mixtape and some song recommendations, let me know if any links are dead or if any formatting is fucked up, this was a lot of work so I'm sure there are mistakes somewhere. BURR!

[**2006 - Chicken Talk**](http://downloads.crackmixtapes.com/mixtape/Gucci_Mane-Chicken_Talk/#_)

This is what got Gucci on the map. It featured production from Raw Beats and DJ Paul &amp; Juicy J. Features came from frequent Gucci collaborators like Yo Gotti and Shawty Lo. Gucci went in at Jeezy on 745, an early sign of both Gucci's propensity towards beef and his rivalry with Jeezy.

 *Essential tracks:*

* [Trap Money ft. Shawty Lo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFKLvIY76PE)

* [How Hood Is This ft. Yo Gotti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33dQREkO-U8)

* [745](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llC_lQlkQmI)

* [Zone 6](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx9aSgOBqQM)

[**2007 - Bird Flu Pt. 1**](http://crackmixtapes.com/mixtape/Gucci_Mane-Bird_Flu)

This tape recycles a bunch of songs from Chicken Talk but is unique if not simply for the fact Gucci actually apologizes to another rapper for starting shit. He famously apologizes to T.I. over a misunderstanding the two had at the time. Younger Gucci was more diplomatic but as we know now he was just an ice cream cone tattoo away from being the Trap God...

*Essential tracks:*

* [Stick Em Up ft. La Chat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkClo5L6D4k)

* [I'm a J ft. Lil Jon &amp; Fabo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhyLn18cq5U)

* [Bird Flu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCIv2V5Y118)

* [Dat Boi Cold ft. K Riley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQpeMFx1xck)

[**2007 - Ice Attack**](http://allmixtapes.com/mixtapes/listen/ice_attack)

This was produced almost entirely by Zaytoven who would become a mainstay on Gucci tracks as well as one of the preeminent trap producers. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [Give Us What U Got ft. 4Tre &amp; Jody Breeze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPOdjPvNJrU)

* [Alligators](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0Si5-sLXQ)

* [Freaky Gurl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIMaYajamyw)

[**2007 - Ice Attack 2**](http://allmixtapes.com/mixtapes/listen/ice_attack_2)

Installment #2 was once again handled by Zaytoven. Gucci's early work also helped established the Trap-A-Holics mixtape team and gave us those classic adlibs.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Hit Another Lick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNXrKp91_xM)

* [Cot Damn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0gUq11yBuc)

* [Iced Out Bart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ijn4B8BRY)

[**2007 - No Pad, No Pencil**](http://mixtapeleak.com/music/2084/gucci-mane-no-pad-no-pencil/)

Some freesyles and a few new tracks and a bunch of freestyles on this one but not a lot of substance on this one, sort of ironic considering the title. It did give us a fire track with OJ Da Juiceman however.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Woosh ft. OJ Da Juiceman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPZCzVi9_aA)

[**2007 - Guap-A-Holics**](http://mixtapemania.com/mixtape/dj-scream-gucci-mane-shawty-lo-guap-a-holics/)

This was a collaborative tape with Shawty Lo who alongside Gucci, T.I and Jeezy was a big pioneer of the trap genre as we know it today though he is much lesser known, especially to new fans. It also featured an early collabo with a young Mike Will Made It, another prominent trap producer who benefited from Gucci early on.

*Essential trcks:*

* [Lock Me Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSiVibkrPek)

* [Re-Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsRBXsTfM3k)

* [Smoke Kush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ2uVT6kC2I)

* [Dey Know ft. Ludacris, Young Jeezy, Lil Wayne &amp; Plies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohNuBnrfcio)

[**2008 - EA Sportscenter**](http://mixtapeddl.com/dj-holiday-zaytoven-gucci-mane-ea-sportscenter/)

Zaytoven was back on production for this, Gucci among his many infamous tattoos has the big EA logo on his neck. Rocko was featured on this tape before he created 327 versions of UOENO. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [Fast Break](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x8e-loJYLc)

* [Bricks ft. Yung Ralph &amp; Yo Gotti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIS8twlzuMw)

* [Lots of Cash ft. Yo Gotti &amp; Rocko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crQF4ljcj5U)

[**2008 - Gucci Sosa**](http://mixtapeleak.com/music/1867/gucci-mane-gucci-sosa/)

This tape had a hilarious cover and is responsible for Chief Keef calling himself Gucci Sosa. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [Mo Money ft. OJ Da Juiceman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3X82NuYOhQ)

* [Thirsty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGVsscACGuw)

* [Stunt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTgjqpMe99E)

* [Mr. Perfect](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c91nZwgNuiw)

[**2008 - Mr. Perfect**](http://guccimaneclassics.blogspot.ca/2012/10/mixtape-gucci-mane-mr-perfect.html)

Higher than a falcon on California reefer. This recycles a lot from his previous mixtapes but it has a few new tracks.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Ridiculous ft. Yo Gotti](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGdIfo0stoo)

* [Ms. Pacman ft. Rich Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDie0iN_AiA)

[**2008 - Definition of a G**](http://mixtapemania.com/mixtape/dj-drama-gucci-mane-and-yo-gotti-definition-of-a-g/)

This was a collaborative effort with Yo Gotti as part of DJ Drama's Gangsta Grillz series. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [Call the Weed Man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5of4fS4kpI)

* [Smoke ft. Willie Da Kid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc2EjoIM_fs)

* [Put On For My City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h85AiuEwUk)

[**2008 - The Movie**](http://allmixtapes.com/mixtapes/listen/the_movie)

The first part in Guwop's movie series, I like to think Gucci is a big fan of period pieces and wants to get Judi Dench on a track.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Gangsta Movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPvsc4tzQNU)

* [Georgia ft. Gorilla Zoe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_n8bqw7cZc)

* [Love Fo Money ft. Willie The Kid, Trey Songz, LA The Darkman, Bun B &amp; Flo-Rida](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65GAh-LXVw8)

[**2009 - Bird Flu Pt. 2**](http://allmixtapes.com/mixtapes/listen/bird_flu_pt2)

The follow up  to Bird Flu 1 and yet another bird-themed tape from Gucci. I wonder if he had one of those bird watching books and a little pair of binoculars as a kid, I'd pay money to hear Gucci recite the proper Latin names to different birds.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Cheerios](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MOIR838y_M)

* [Throw Up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUxo17lCmSw)

* [I'm So Fresh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxGmmlncdCY)

[**2009 - Bird Money**](http://www.datpiff.com/Gucci-Mane-Bird-Money-mixtape.38206.html)

Mostly stuff from albums and previous tapes though it had 7-8 new tracks. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [All My Jewelry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtGAw4PSeEM)

* [Bounce That](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qErurGkSJs)

* [Do The Math](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_U4M682ys0)

[**2009 - Writing on the Wall**](http://www.datpiff.com/Gucci-Mane-Writing-On-The-Wall-mixtape.46179.html)

This was Gucci's first release after doing a prison stint. This release is notable for Gucci's flow evolving and this opened him up to a bigger audience than before. This is the beginning of the Gucci you know.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Hurry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQIZjadG4bg)

* [Game ft. OJ Da Juiceman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHy7nBJPwE)

* [Wasted ft. Plies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wBOiO5ptJk)

* [Pussy Rehab ft. Tity Boi (aka 2 Chainz)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEJgdQed7j4)

[**2009 - The Movie Part 2: The Sequel**](http://crackmixtapes.com/mixtape/Gucci_Mane-The_Movie_Part_2)

This tape was feature heavy top to bottom and showcased a lot of So Icey rappers. People tend to either dig this or dislike it because of the features so it's really up to what you want to hear: Gucci on his own or Gucci with every rapper he could find.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Hottest Rapper ft. Waka Flocka Flame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9voOYz3GyUE)

* [Superhero ft. J. Futuristic, Waka Flocka Flame &amp; Shawna](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK5yU_DRaE)

* [Ain't Nothing Else to Do ft. Shawty Lo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYH575HZq7U)

[**2009 - Burrprint 3D: The Movie Part III**](http://www.datpiff.com/Gucci-Mane-The-Burrprint-The-Movie-3D-mixtape.483951.html)

One of Gucci's best tapes, he scaled back the features and went in mostly on his own. Gucci really stepped up his hook game on this tape.

*Essential tracks:*

* [Dope Boyz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBSDySw778o)

* [I Want Her](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi572TcrAC8)

* [Trap Goin Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAum09fJI94)

* [Real As They Get ft. OJ Da Juiceman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igh5ZxXSkug)

* [Foreign ft. Shawty Redd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LEC0EidknA)

[**2009 - Cold War Trilogy: Great Brrrritain**](http://illmixtapes.com/gucci-mane-great-brrritain-cold-war/), [**Brrrrussia**](http://mixtapeleak.com/music/1830/gucci-mane-the-cold-war-brrrus/) and [**Guccimerica**](http://www.mixtapefactory.com/DJ_Drama-Gucci_Mane-The_Cold_War_Guccimerica.html)

Yes, Gucci dropped three mixtapes on a single day. He gets hated on for being a ""dumb"" rapper and shit but the dudes hustle is unquestionable, you gotta have some brains to be able to keep putting out shit and sustaining an audience for that much material. 

*Essential tracks:*

* [Street Cred ft. Drake &amp; Killer Mike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzUjWlVOBuI)

[**2009 - The Burrprint 2: HD**](http://allmixtapes.com/mixtapes/listen/burrprint_2_hd)

Arguably Gucci's best tape, Burrprint 2 was produced almost exclusively by Drumma Boy. It was released while Gucci was (shockingly) in jail and the intro was recorded over the phone while incarcerated. The album had a lot of features, most notably Rick Ross, OJ Da Juiceman, Waka Flocka Flame, Trey Songz and Ludacris.

1365209030.0	1brqrh	[Starters Guide] Waka Flocka Flame’s Mixtapes	Chrussell	69	5	14	"I’m only making this guide about his mixtapes because he only has 3 albums and if you haven’t already heard those then you should don’t need a guide for that.

Flocka like Gucci has released a ton of tapes so this guide will be fairly long. He began to blow up when he released the single O Lets Do It. He followed up with more street bangers like Hard in Da Paint and Luv Them Gun Sounds produced by Lux Luger and longtime bricksquad producer Southside. He helped the trap scene gain more mainstream attention with his debut album Flockaveli in 2010.


[**Salute Me Or Shoot Me (January 2009)**](http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/3731/waka_flocka_flame_salute_me_or_shoot_me.html)

This was his debut mixtape and featured production by Tay Beatz, Don Beatz and Southside as well as some others.

His first of two collaborations with fellow Bricksquad artist Slim Dunkin. I’m not sure who handles the production but it’s a solid tape.

This mixtape is pretty well produced compared to the first one. It has production from Mike Will, Lex Luger, Shawty Redd, Southide, Mike Da Rockman and others. It has a few features from Bricksquad but it’s mostly just Flocka going in. This is a really great tape that should definitely be picked up.

*Essential Tracks*

*[Go Hard Prod. Lex Luger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgfFvrqH6So) - This is basically the early version of Hard in Da Paint. Not really that different.

[**LeBron Flocka James (October 2009)**](http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/10641/lebron_flocka_james.html)

This tape has the same producers as his last couple and has a few more features. It’s got a lot more lex luger on here now though. It’s the first tape in the 3 part LeBron Flocka series. It’s a pretty good tape with some decent singles. It’s got a few recycled tracks like o lets do it and hard inda paint again but those songs are too good to not be put on again.

*Essential Tracks*

[**Streets R Us w/ Travis Porter (October 2009)**](http://www.datpiff.com/Travis-Porter-Waka-Flocka-Streets-R-Us-mixtape.75001.html)

A collaboration mixtape with the group Travis Porter. Flocka isnt on all the songs but this is a great tape. A bunch of repeats again. I’m not really sure who does the production at all.

*Essential Tracks*

*[Travis Porter Ft. Roscoe Dash - Bananas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIwtmvYYz-o)

[**True Blood w/ Jon Geezy (January 2009)**](http://www.datpiff.com/Jon-Geezy-Waka-Flocka-True-Blood-mixtape.90745.html)

Don’t really know much about this tape or Jon Geezy in general but its still decent.

[**LeBron Flocka James 2 (April 2010)**](http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/11116/lebron_flocka_james_2.html)

The last tape that Flocka drops before his debut album Flockaveli. Not really his best or his worst. It has a lot of features on this one, including quite a few outside of Bricksquad like Roscoe Dash and Eldorado Red. Production like usual is handed by BSM producers Lex Luger, Tay Beatz and others.

*Essential Tracks*

*[Intro - Still Standing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1jPBDnspgs)

[**Salute Me Or Shoot Me 3 (February 2011)**](http://www.datpiff.com/Waka-Flocka-Salute-Me-Or-Shoot-Me-3-mixtape.201216.html)

One of his best tapes, has more Southside, Lex Luger as well as Zaytoven and Drumma Boy. Not many weak tracks and tons of great collabs. Essential tape for any Flocka fan.

*Essential Tracks*

*[Clap Prod. DJ Speedy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryHOrGmUHbA)

[**Benjamin Flocka (April 2011)**](http://www.datpiff.com/Waka-Flocka-Benjamin-Flocka-mixtape.218773.html)

Not as good as his last tape, but there’s still some tracks worth checking out. The tape is mostly produced by southside. All the best tracks on here are recycled but there’s some pretty good new ones.

*Essential Tracks*

*[Lotto Ticket Ft. Young Dose, P Smurf, Slim Dunkin, Ice B, YG Hootie &amp; Short Dawg Prod. Prince N Purps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqGyhQQ2uS4)

Some great tracks, some repeats. Not something you really need to get other than a couple singles.

*Essential Tracks

*[Mud Musik Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Tity Boi (2 Chainz) Prod. Southside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgvNeYyV8Q) - tracks from ferrari boyz

The last tape Flocka managed to do with Slim D before he died. This is a lot better than the first and definitely an essential BSM mixtape. Production on this tape is great, it’s seriously hard to pick the best songs. Actually just ignore my suggestions and get the entire tape. RIP.

So you guys have been axin' about getting some sort of essentials list going in here so I'm looking for some feedback about a couple things. 

* Since mixtapes are such a key component to the genre do you think they should be included alongside albums?

* Since we're not going back to the 1970s with this what kind of timeframe do you want to work within? Example: Finally Rich came out last year and is an important album within the genre but is it essential? 

* Differing from r/hiphopheads, would you like to see a little more information as to *why* something is essential and influential. 

* Should producers be included as the trap sound is just as important to the lyrical content (yeah /r/music there's lyrical content)

* We've been thinking about doing some starters guides to the more popular artists, kind of like trapmuzik for dummies, would people be interested in this? (i.e. A starters guide to Gucci or Waka because of the high volume of releases they both have)

* Should I eat chicken or beef tonight? Help me out  guys!

Put your feedback in here, discuss, and feel free to send the mods fruit baskets because we are all very healthy and want to set good examples. I'm partial to citrus fruits.

edit:

Alright thanks for the input, in a day or two I will make a thread where you guys can mention albums, mixtapes and producers, we will use those three criteria to make a list. It will be helpful if you guys can include a little info or tagline with your submissions i.e. Lex Luger is important because ____ and so forth, you don't need to write a novel but a little something will be helpful for me arranging stuff, I'll add my own input on it as well.

To clarify about the starters guides and how they'd differ from the essentials lists, we all know Gucci and Waka are going to have albums and such on here. It would be a separate post we'd throw in the sidebar that would explore the artist and their body of work a bit more. Myself or someone else would write an OP outlining them, their body of work, key places to start/listen to etc, and then people can add their input in the comments, sort of like spotlighting certain people so someone new can go grab a few tapes or albums and have a better understanding than trying to figure out why BayTL is so bad (because it is) and why Trap Back is great.

Feel free to keep adding shit in here and I will sort through it, thanks again for the input. 

edit 2:

/u/the_oskie_woskie had a good idea about including download links for the mixtapes, so when we start compiling a list please include either a datpiff or livemixtapes link so people can go through the list and be able to actually get these tapes."	t5_2slji	True

Chances are if you've listened to rap music for a year you get this but people need to be reminded:

* This sub is for ""trap muzik, dirty south, crunk or any other rap you would bang in the club."" as per the sidebar, does your submission encompass that?

What *is* trap muzik or trap rap and does it let me do the Harlem shake? 

* No, there is no Harlem shaking to be had here. /r/trap is for **any EDM style trap music**. Say again **any EDM style trap music** goes to /r/trap. Jame$!

What about a Waka or Gucci song that has been remixed to the EDM sound?

* Again, this is not the place for EDM-based music. Take a second to scour the sub, listen to a few songs, does your song sound similar? If it doesn't chances are you haven't found the next big thing you've just found something that belongs elsewhere on reddit.

I'd also like the highlight something a lot of people don't understand. Being a mod doesn't make you cooler, it doesn't make you some sort of powerful deity. Mostly it means you have to clean up messes because people are too lazy to read the rules. Someone responding to /u/dhaft88 as a ""crybaby"" because he wants people to follow the rules is ridiculous. dhaft designed most of this sub and a lot of /r/hiphopheads. He doesn't get paid to do this as do none of us. I don't get paid to give you guys the essentials vote or to do artist guides, we do these things to give you a better community and we don't receive and compensation for it. 

/u/fuzzy_dunnlop moderates a ton of subs on here, /u/sperdoj moderates other stuff and on top of this we all work and go to school or both in some peoples cases. Following the rules helps things run smoother and it frees us up to give you better content and a better experience, this shit takes time to do and we appreciate cooperation so so things run smoother. 

Don't be an asshole because you're behind a computer, if you're just a naturally kind of an asshole (and devilishly handsome) like me, try to be less of one. This is your community, if you see someone post a Bauuer song or whatever point them in the right direction, don't question their sexuality and stuff, point it out, use the message the moderator function so we're actually alerted to this and can handle it quicker.

Any other comments or suggestions feel free to touch upon here and be civil because I know none of you are bout this life so let's all enjoy the gift that is trap muzik without being dicks and stuff."	t5_2slji	True

Any post that I see titled [BANGER] [TURNTUP] [LOLIMBRACKETINGSHIT] I will remove, simple as that. This isn't going to be HHH where there's 30 brackets. Artist - Song as well please and thanks.

The other thing for the millionth time is this is NOT a place for EDM trap. If you look at the front page here, does this seem like the place to post a Daft Punk song? Does the CSS look like a place to post Tame Impala mixes? Come on now. 

The other reminder I'd like to state is at the start of every month I will be holding a sidebar contest, the winning entry will receive reddit gold from me (you fucks cost me money, that's how much I luv you) and have their image included on the sidebar for dozens of people to see! Well, maybe a singular dozen but still that's like...12 people. So work on your photoshops and what not, it doesn't have to be made by you necessarily but chances are if you pull it off tumblr I've seen it 3 months ago, get ridiculous, get creative.

For specific trap related subs check out /r/ChiefKeef and /r/freebandz. If any of you guys have other trap related ones let me know and I'll shout them out. Thanks for continuing to get turnt up and Bugatti-ing.

In this guide I will cover all of Gucci's studio releases to this point. Keep in mind Gucci is releasing **Trap House III** this year, June 2nd is the tentative release date but don't quote me on that, music industry be crazy yo.

Gucci is one of a trio of guys who are credited for really establishing the trap sound. You had groups like Three Six Mafia and UGK who helped create the sound and then you had Gucci Mane, T.I and Young Jeezy who were able to take the sound and really establish it as its own thing. 

I will break down his albums and include what I think are essential tracks for each. If you are looking at Gucci and feel a bit overwhelmed with his catalogue then this will give you some indication as to where you can start or songs to check out. BRRR!

[**Trap House (2005)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_House)

In case your parents don't like bad words there was in fact a clean version of this album released. Study hard! The album featured production from Zaytoven, Shawty Redd, Heatmakerz and Nitti. Zaytoven and Shawty Redd are both prominent producers within the trap genre. This album was also released independently so the next time some barista with a 13th century French art degree tries to play some cool independent Atmosphere, bump this.

*Essential tracks*: 

* [Trap House](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pjLA4SrI-c) 

* [Icy ft. Young Jeezy &amp; Boo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EO7qPJouXk)

* [Pyrex Pot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rY6-1wYg5Q)

* [Black Tee ft. Bun B, Lil Scrappy, Young Jeezy, Killer Mike &amp;  Jody Breeze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8x4sK35cus)

* [Go Head ft. Mac Bre-Z](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB6yKXC4_Ks)

[**Hard to Kill (2006)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Kill_%28album%29)

Once again released independently. Almost exclusively produced by Zaytoven, the album also featured production from Nitty, Cyber Sapp and Josh Butler. In a case of art imitating life Gucci Mane is in fact hard to kill.  Hopefully he doesn't go the B.I.G. route and prognosticate his own death.

*Essential tracks*

* [Street Niggas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNsCxa4BZB8) 

* [Freaky Gurl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtT3_bHgF8o) also there's a remix to this where someone remixed Santigold's first album with a bunch of Southern rappers. [Remixxxxx!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCIkZh6XTbg)
 
* [Pillz ft. Mac Bre-Z](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J_nnjUoSV8)

* [Drive Fast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1pTD51N46U)

* [Stick em Up ft. La Chat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7gEPeoOs-g)

* [We Live This ft. Black Magic &amp; Young Snead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_pYh9Pm-6I)


[**Trap-A-Thon (2007)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap-A-Thon)

So Gucci says not to buy this or support it because he deems it an ""unauthorized"" release. Basically he left Big Cat Records and joined Atlantic to release ""Back to the Trap House"" and they put this out with some old tracks and urealeased stuff. Everything essential on here is pointed out elsewhere in this guide. 

[**Back to the Trap House (2007)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Trap_House)

Gucci's first major label release, he's like Atlantic. Probably his most iconic album cover, Gucci proves that much like Mr. Muthafuckin Exquire he's got a big belly and will still take his shirt off like Nelly. This album saw much more diversity when it came to producers as Zaytoven, Shawty Redd, Nitty, a very young Hit Boy and Polow Da Don made appearances.

*Essential tracks*

* [Freaky Gurl Remix ft. Ludacris &amp; Lil Kim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikf3JTq1gD4)

* [I Know Why ft. Pimp C, Rich Boy &amp; Blaze 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6K46gvoVMs)

* [Bird Flu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCIv2V5Y118)

* [I Move Chickens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8NPxoO9DM)

[**Murder Was the Case (2009)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Was_the_Case_%28Gucci_Mane_album%29)

Gucci again considers this to not be a real album and doesn't endorse it. Zaytoven and DJ Speedy handled the bulk of the production. 

*Essential tracks*

* [Stupid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4NCByULtrM)

* [Runnin' Back](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVk8YaD-8tw)

[**The State vs. Radric Davis (2009)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_State_vs._Radric_Davis)

This is arguably Gucci's best album and it saw a big jump in notable producers. The album featured Zaytoven, Drumma Boy, Polow Da Don, Bangladesh, Scott Storch, Shawty Redd, Jazze Pha, J.U.S.T.I.C.E League &amp; Mannie Fresh among others. The album also has some very notable features from trap and hip-hop as a whole with Usher, Lil Wayne, Cam'ron, Soulja Boy, Waka Flocka Flame, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Bun B, OJ Da Juiceman and more.

*Essential tracks*

* [Stupid Wild ft. Lil Wayne &amp; Cam'ron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeecXBRgn-w)

* [All About The Money ft. Rick Ross](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC6gmcBIFTI)

* [Lemonade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Q4s_ZdvAQ)

* [Bingo ft. Soulja Boy &amp; Waka Flocka Flame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMgJLgsO8WI)

* [Gingerbread Man ft. OJ Da Juiceman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCg6mAuUEQU)

* [Wasted ft. Plies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wBOiO5ptJk)

[**The Appeal: Georgia's Most Wanted (2010)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Appeal:_Georgia%27s_Most_Wanted)

Part two of ""The State"" trilogy, the Appeal fittingly dropped not long after Gucci was released from prison for an old aggravated assault charge. Perhaps foreshadowing future events the album didn't feature Waka (or OJ) and caused some tension at the time though everyone brushed it off at the time. Production credits included Zaytoven, The Neptunes, Swizz Beatz, Lex Luger, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Drumma Boy &amp; Jim Jonsin.

*Essential tracks*

* [Little Friend ft. Bun B](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6H0LJb0IZ4)

* [Missing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjdN7UznTFM)

* [What's It Gonna Be](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9YFdYh1mx8)

* [Gucci Time ft. Swizz Beatz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VoIAzC_0zs)

1363752272.0	1an6hu	The Starter’s Guide to Three 6 Mafia’s Studio Albums	champcantwin	46	10	17	"**The Starter’s Guide to Three 6 Mafia’s Studio Albums**


Fellow trappers, this is champcantwin’s starter’s guide to all the best songs from Three 6 Mafia’s nine studio albums! For more information on Three 6 Mafia, I would recommend the [Wiki page] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_6_Mafia) to get started! Why be redundant?


In this guide, I cover all nine studio albums from Three 6 Mafia. The problem is deciding what tracks would be considered “essential.” Three 6 Mafia were mostly an “underground” group whose fame was mainly in the mid-south until the release of *Da Unbreakables.* Where applicable, I listed hits from a specific album under the *Essential Tracks* category, however, some of the earlier albums don’t necessarily contain mainstream hits or even tracks that could be considered singles. I used my own taste to feel these voids to what I felt were the best tracks on the album.


I also includes a second category, *Posse Song*. Three 6 Mafia are known for always including a song that features all of the members of the group along with other recording artists on the Hypnotize Camp label. These tracks are a definite essential for listening to and understanding what makes Three 6 Mafia one of the most influential groups in the trap genre.


The last category I use is the *Bonus Homework* category. These tracks are my favorite deep tracks on the album which are considered “cult classics” or just some of my favorite tracks. I hope you enjoy them!
Finally, this list is mainly a matter of opinion, and I am open to input if anyone would like to suggest a track or argue about the “essential status* of any track.


All links are to the best quality YouTube link that I could find. Enjoy!

Currently working on part 2 of the Gucci mixtape guide for those who liked part 1, also big shoutout to /u/BigWicked for adding a Spotify play list for all our essential albums, check out the essential albums thread for updated info.

For all your Sosa needs we are working on /r/ChiefKeef at the moment, stop by and offer up suggestions for what you wanna see from your favourite group of Chicago troublemakers. Make sure to support /r/twerking in our goal to become the #1 twerk spot on a website that was once dedicated to asking questions about science. Also shout out to the homies over at /r/freebandz for skurrrrrring in their new Bugattis, check them out. 

So aside from gift bags what would you guys like to see improved around here? The biggest part to any sub is you the community, so feel free to offer up any suggestions or throw out ideas on how to make this place more interactive and interesting. 

One idea I was thinking about was either a bi-weekly or monthly sidebar contest, some hilarious stuff has been made either in this sub or other subs that we've used on the sidebar to keep things 3HUNNA in the laugh department, would you guys be up for that?

May he be forever shamed for talking shit, anyone who makes fun of him will receive a personal upvote from me which is a *big* deal.

*But shun-16 even though you are very handsome I don't agree with some of these entires!*

That's democracy kids, vote harder next time if you disagree with some of the entries, this sub is a reflection of you, the users, so you can only blame yourselves if you mad.

The next vote will be for producers which will happen sometime in the future, so get your ^Lex ^^Luger ^^^sound ready and if anyone can guess Young Chop's weight you win that number in jellybeans. It's like a fuckin state fair of type 2 diabetes. Thank you guys by the way for not submitting any EDM trap, I was proud.

1375817633.0	1jty9a	[STATE OF THE TRAP] Shit gets sticky, you have a new mod, it's fuckin SHARK WEEK	shun-16	28	1	7	"Seriously shark week is awesome. Alright here's your rundown of recent happenings and shit in regards to the greatest place for trap rap on the entire internet (because Reddit admins actually listen to this sub, take that rest of reddit). 

So first off reddit has now implemented for us mods the ability to sticky a self post at the top of any sub, which I have done with the rule thread so make sure you read it as I am still removing posts frequently. artist - song format is what we want, it may seem trivial but it goes a long way in curbing ridiculous tags that subs fall into that takes away from the music because it becomes an arms race to make stupid tags. People should be able to scroll through the sub and easily understand what they are clicking on. 

The other thing I've noticed recently is some reposting going on, especially on things posted within a few days. Guys, give the front page a look and it's always a good idea to use the search function, this sub isn't so big that the search function is totally useless. I know it's not the best search bar in the world but it helps. If you ARE going to repost something, give it a 6 month window though I'd prefer we don't fall into posting popular songs for karma grabs because they did good months ago. 

We have added a new mod, /u/Churssell to the esteemed panel of trap gods. This move is for a few reasons, mainly I am moving countries soon and will be getting used to a new life so I wanted to add someone to help pick up my slack with enforcing rules and such. I've worked hard to make this place better and provide you guys with the best possible product along with some key posters and a generally good community of subscribers, so I don't want any slack in the mack. Chrussell understands the genre, he provides a lot of quality submissions, he's helpful within comments and from dealing with him on a more personal level he is a great guy and he fits in well with the dynamic we have going behind the scenes so treat him good, he's here to make things better and help this place continue to grow in a positive way. 

Also if any of you fucks have Black Ops 2 for PS3 hit me up on PSN shuNonesix and let's throw some 14 year olds out of moving cars like Guwop would. 

Continue being respectful to each other, we have more guides on the way (we started this guide shit, reddit always gotta steal from the trap) and look out for Juicy J's album which drops this month especially if you are new to this kind of music, doesn't get much better than one of the original members of Three 6 Mafia. Bird sound adlib goes here.

If you're still confused submit your tape and prefix it with ""is this a mixtape"" so I know you at least tried to follow the guidelines and I won't summon dark entities to terrorize your close family. Reading is fundamental. 

I have also brought together a shadow council of people to review the [ESSENTIAL ALBUMS](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1b7lax/rtrapmuzik_essential_albums_list/) thread and after much insight and debate I have added three more albums to the list because, being an ESSENTIAL ALBUMS list, those albums are fucking essential. So Project Pat - Mista Don't Play, Big Tymers - I Got That Work and Shawty Lo - Units in the City have been added. 

Big shout out to /u/Chrussell for putting together [the starter's guide for Waka Flocka Flame's mixtapes, click here bitches](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1brqrh/starters_guide_waka_flocka_flames_mixtapes/) so go get your learn on and give him props. Make sure to check the sidebar for your community starter's guides to artists and your essentials lists. 

**IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING DOING A STARTER'S GUIDE**: let me know beforehand so I can talk to about formatting and shit and so I know what's coming. Input from this community is appreciated as both /u/champcantwin and /u/Chrussell have been a big help. A sub is as good as the people who use it so if you want to see a change be the change you want to see children. 

**READ THIS SHIT WITH YOUR EYEBALLS**


As per the sidebar ""THE subreddit for trap muzik, dirty south, crunk or any other rap you would bang in the club.""

Rules for this motherfucking vote are as follows:

* Include a link for your mixtape to a reputable download site (Datpiff, LiveMixtapes etc) this will save time when I have to make the final list. Despite demanding more money /u/fuzzy_dunnlop currently pays us nothing to be mods so helping me out is cool. **IF YOU DON'T READ THE FIRST RULE I WILL REMOVE YOUR SHIT**

* One submission per post

* Do not spam submissions. Post a mixtape and let it breathe. If you have another tape you want to submit **GIVE IT SOME TIME**. If it still hasn't been posted you are free to add it in a separate post

* Please go through the thread and upvote stuff you agree with, check back tomorrow when everything has been posted and upvote the stuff you missed that you like, I don't want this being the first 20 mixtapes get all the votes and something good gets posted and buried. Don't make me put contest mode on and deprive you of your precious orangered arrows

* If you post TNGHT I will punch your mom

* Feel free to discuss why you think x mixtape is essential, one of the more helpful things in the Essential Albums guide was people actually saying *why* they submitted something, it's the reason some shit got added later so use your words

* Play nice

The problem though is that I prefer listening to whole tapes as opposed to just songs. Since I've played LiveLoveA$ap into the ground, I've been looking for more mixtapes to fill that need, but all the ones I find tend to be like three good tracks and an hour of filler.

Aside from the obvious we will offer competent moderation like you have experienced both here and in /r/hiphopheads, there's a reason these subs don't suck to use. 

Feel free to post your twerk videos, gifs and pictures of ass shakery. Help us become the destination on this site for booty shakin' or I will start allowing Bauuer songs to be posted daily.

Unless you have the subreddit style turned off, in which case I will personally leg kick you into submission, you can see (at the moment) a picture of a fictional Waka Flock breakfast cereal. This is our sidebar and if you scroll down it you will find all sorts of fun stuff and some shit that doesn't make sense because /u/fuzzy_dunlop has been busy collecting fresh intel on Kony. The sidebar now contains links to the first two /r/rapmuzik starters guides. Big shoutout to /u/champcantwin for creating the first one, [a guide to Three Six Mafia's studio albums](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1an6hu/the_starters_guide_to_three_6_mafias_studio_albums/), as well as [my guide to Gucci Mane's studio albums](http://www.reddit.com/r/trapmuzik/comments/1avn4x/starters_guide_gucci_manes_studio_albums/). These guides are to help introduce you to the bodies of work of certain artists and help you get started with their bodies of work, stuff to listen to, informative facts and all that. There will be more coming in the future but for now you can check those out on the sidebar.

Tomorrow I will be posting the official thread to submit Essential Albums. Reading is important so these are **albums**, not mixtapes. There will be upcoming votes for essential mixtapes and producers so don't fret. Brainstorm, go through your zune playlists and submit your ideas in the thread tomorrow. It would be helpful if you included why you think it is essential to the genre and please use your ctrl+f search feature to make sure something hasn't been submitted, we don't need 30 posts about Flockaveli. Upvote the stuff you agree with, add your thoughts and play nice."	t5_2slji	True

1338736087.0	uin5r	Just wanted to say if anyone needs samples (Gun shots, anything from a Youtube video) let me know and I will help you out...	ETL4nubs	17	3	8	"I'm sure some of you have seen my posts saying I can record anything that comes out of my speakers, so I'd like to help out and give you guys anything you might need.


Example: Flocka posted this http://www.therapboard.com/ in a thread the other day. If anyone wants any of those samples, I can provide.

Also, I do have a whole folder of gunshots that I have made from various games, and I have gathered some of them from various locations.

There are samples of really anything online. I recorded a track for a small band a few weeks ago and they wanted to talk at the end of the song and have a scene at a bar. So I searched google for ""Bar ambiance sounds"" and found a recording of a crowded bar. So I looped it and threw it at the end. Sounds great.

Basically My mixer (Presonus studio live) hooks up to Fruity Loops to use as a basic input device. But since it is a digital board, I can select the output channel of the mixer and use it as an input channel in fruity loops. (I guess is the best way to explain it). So anything I play out of my speakers, gets recorded in the EXACT quality it comes out. I've used it for gun sounds from Counter-strike and battlefield, and have gotten various samples from random Youtube videos.

TL;DR - whachuneed Igotchu. RIVERDALLLLLE
