1354698951.0	14bdb5	What do you think today's MMORPGs are lacking?	skebeedoo	130	13	320	"Hello r/MMORPG. I was wondering what you think today's MMORPGs are lacking. As a long time player of MMORPGs I have noticed a general trend that the lifespan of MMORPGs seems to be shrinking and that MMORPG players seem to have very little faith in developers taking their games in the right direction.

I'm thinking about starting an MMORPG project with some friends(yeah I know, there are a lot of obstacles in the way and it's a lot of work to do. But fortunately I have some very talented friends!). I think the biggest problem with today's MMORPGs is that they lack different kinds of content(more importantly than volume, its quality and variety), complexity when it comes to gameplay(most MMORPGs are very streamlined these days), and difficulty(most MMORPGs are just a walk in the park these days).

If you wouldn't mind, I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks MMORPGs are lacking and what the future of MMORPGs needs."	t5_2qlxw	True

1376577862.0	1kf5kt	"All these ""looking for a new mmorpg"" threads."	crowquilled	91	31	70	Am I the only one who is a bit tired of them? Every day the same question or similar is brought up, and almost every day the answer is split among the same couple of good active games the market currently has: FFXIV, Eve, Rift, Tera, GW2, and I'm probably forgetting some, but it hardly goes beyond that. Whatever OP wants, be it sandbox, open skills, f2p/p2p, open world pvp, populated, etc., leads to the same answers. Those threads are boring, are getting repetitive, don't add up anything, and to me it seems the people who ask them didn't even bother investigating. It's not like there are hundreds of games to choose from anyway. Well technically there are, but we know the MMORPG industry is going through a bad time and unfortunately there aren't many games that are still active enough to make worth a try. I may be wrong, or I may not understand the purpose of this subreddit, but I think it would be much better to have a solid MMORPG list with a summary of its features and pros and cons for everyone to check first before flooding the subreddit with the same question.	t5_2qlxw	True
1371882077.0	1guel3	Thank you, FFXIV.	xhieron	81	21	39	"This might come across as a little saccharine, so heads up.

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone at S-E who've poured their blood, sweat, and tears into ARR (and version 1, too, for that matter).  It's beautiful, it plays like a dream, it sounds unmistakably like one of the most brilliant composers of the modern era, and everything about it reminds me of the franchise's entrenched place in my childhood and all the memories that come with that, to say nothing of XI, which I've maintained until today is the most fun you can have at a computer with both hands on the keyboard and mouse.

I found out earlier tonight that my father has a mass on his lung.  We're not sure what it is: it could be harmless.  Or it could be, well... you know what else it could be.  Everybody knows what else it could be.  Of course the entire family is experiencing a series of mini-breakdowns interspersed with optimism, resolve, and timid hope.  There'll be a biopsy tomorrow or early next week and then we'll know whether to panic or not.

So I came home from the hospital tonight an emotional basket-case, did a few of the maudlin expected things, and then I sat down and I leveled my little Marauder from level 1 to level 4 (and drank, of course).

And when I got done, of course I'm still alternating between total meltdown and get-yourself-together-it's-probably-fine moments, but when I did my nightly ""let's check reddit just one more time (for four and a half hours) before bed routine,"" I didn't trudge over to /christianity to beg for prayers (though Lord knows we need them and I'll take any that are offered), and I didn't try to vomit my feelings up onto /offmychest (though I may yet do that).

Instead I came here, to lift my bottle to Yoshi-P and his cohorts, because their project brought me a moment of comfort when I was low.  Maybe it's a little ridiculous, but I think on some level all gamers get it.  Someone comes home with this news and plays piano.  Another guy opens up an account and works all night.  Another grabs his (struggling) cat and curls up with it for a few hours.

I played the XIV beta.

And it's a fucking excellent game.  I know the real deal is still a couple months away, and this being a beta weekend plus me even having access is somewhere between dumb luck and divine providence, but I just wanted to take a minute and say thanks.

'and to say also, really, if this game isn't on your radar, your radar's broken.

EDIT:  It's pneumonia.  Praise the holy name of Jesus.  I didn't think I'd ever find myself singing hallelujah for a diagnosis of pneumonia, but I've got no complaints.  Biopsy results came in this morning (7-1-13); no cancer.  Now the family is moving on, and I just wanted to extend my thanks to everyone for the kind remarks, prayers, hopes, and good wishes during the ordeal."	t5_2qlxw	True

1368811249.0	1ej164	"Indie MMO ""Project: Gorgon"" is in open testing"	eheimburg	67	4	73	"Our indie MMO, ""Project: Gorgon"", is in pre-alpha testing and could use more players! It's a 3D fantasy MMO focused on exploration and small group combat. It's pretty unusual for a PvE game: no classes, no overall level, tons of skills. It's very open-ended, too: think like how Skyrim does questing, versus how WoW does it. You have a ton of quests available to you, and there's no right order to do them in. Areas aren't level restricted, either, so you can go wherever you want, if you can survive!

I don't want to overhype it, because it's still in pre-alpha and there's tons of glitches, placeholder graphics, and missing features. But it's still pretty fun, if you're into this sort of game. **[Just give it a shot](http://projectgorgon.com/play-now/) and see if you like it.**

One bit of advice: when the game warns you about fates worse than death, it isn't lying.

It's like the cash has finally stopped flowing into MMO's or not like it used to be.

1372523347.0	1hbdza	Project: Gorgon, an MMO focused on exploring, needs more testers!	eheimburg	68	16	43	"Hi, I wanted to plug [Project: Gorgon](http://projectgorgon.com) because I think a lot of people here are looking for a new MMO, and this might be the game you're looking for. It's an indie PvE game that focuses on exploring. That's two kinds of exploring: physically wandering around, obviously, but also about ""systems exploring"", figuring out how the world works and how you can make it do what you want. It's a world full of surprises.

Let me try to paint a picture with bullet points:

* No classes or overall ""character level""
* A huge number of skills and abilities to discover, in all shapes and sizes
* Free-form questing: do quests and tasks when you want, in the order you want. Think Skyrim-style questing
* NPCs that are a little more nuanced than the usual MMO fare
* Tons of world interactions. Milk cows, throw items on the ground, turn into a werewolf and scare the townsfolk
* A few puzzles interspersed to keep you on your toes and your brain engaged
* A dynamic random loot generator that makes loot-finding fun
* Fates worse than death: bringing a bit of true danger back to MMOs with boss monsters that can permanently curse and transform you if you don't beat them
* No PvP (we'll later have ""opt-in"" stuff like Arenas, but it's not focused on being a PvP game)
* NON-instanced dungeons that create a communal experience and let you cooperate and help each other in freeform ways
* Ugly-ass graphics and lots of glitches: we're an indie MMO still in pre-alpha. But it's already lots of fun

It's not even close to done yet, but it's already entertaining, and there's new stuff added every week. And if this sounds like a game you'd enjoy, we could use your help playing, giving feedback, and spreading the word about the game. It's a niche game and it's been hard to get the word out about it, but we're sure there's an audience that's been waiting for just this game, with its mix of old and new MMO ideas.

Also, a word of caution: this is a game that has fates worse than mere death. Death itself isn't that bad, like in most MMOs. But there are fates much worse than death. The game will *always* warn you if you're in danger of one of these, but if you ignore the warnings...

Actually, you know what, let me be less vague. Early on you might find a bucket of milk that you can drink, but you're repeatedly warned not to. Don't drink the milk, or you'll be cursed! I think the game is a little too cruel about this one right now, because players just aren't used to an MMO that has real repercussions in it. It's something we'll work on explaining better in the future.

[ PS - I mentioned this a month ago here and got some great feedback as a result! If you played before and want to try again, I'd love to hear your opinion of the stacked GUI bars. We're trying to find a way to make it easier to intermingle your two active combat skills, and are experimenting with different designs right now. ]"	t5_2qlxw	True

It was the first time I had ever heard of an mmo and at the time it was pretty much just releasing the second patch of vanilla. I had no idea what I was doing and who was a real person and so on. A few months passed and I understood it all, began raiding, doing instances and so on. Up until WOTLK, I had the best gaming years of my life. Problem is, ever since then I am never satisfied with a game. I've tried relogging into wow, I've tried Rift, GW, tons of free ones. I just feel like, although WoW was the best years of my gaming life, it kind of ruined a lot for me.

Does anyone else have this?"	t5_2qlxw	True
1370872298.0	1g1lgp	"I have been thinking about ""that feeling"" when playing a new mmo. You know the one, the one you're always trying to recapture as you go through dozens of titles..."	phailcakez	43	1	51	"Sometimes we're looking for specific features. PvP that works in a certain way, or ""action combat"" or a particular setting. But sometimes we're looking for something a little more intangible. It's hard to put into words what it is, but usually one can describe an experience in which that feeling occurred.

Here is mine:

In FFXI, one of the first MMOs that I played, I had just hit level 5 I think with my elvaan black mage (if you know anyting about FFXI, you know that an Elvaan black mage is not really the best idea, but I didn't know!) I went up a hill and this HUGE orc came barrelling right at me. HOLY SHIT. I could see his camp in the distance as I tried to fight him off. I got scared thinking, if I can't handle this guy out here, what is going to happen when I go in *there*? I don't even remember if I died or not just then, but I remember that feeling.
Exhiliration and excitement. Fear of the unknown. Feeling like I only had myself to depend on at that moment.


So, I guess what that feeling is for me is that fear, exhiliration and excitement. The allure of the unknown.


Why haven't I had that feeling in so long?  Times, they are a'changing. The games largely work on the same core mechanics as they ever did. Level up, get quests, kill stuff, sell stuff, get new gear, kill more stuff.


What is not the same is the way we go about doing these things. Used to be that there was no handholding. There was no Dulfy or ten ton hammer guides. Reviews didn't come out before the game itself. There were no wikis for every last piece pixel's worth of art in the game. Or, perhaps, in my youth, I just never looked hard enough.


In short, there are no longer any secrets. There is nothing to discover. How many times have you been looking for something for maybe 5 whole minutes and gone ""Fuck it, I'll just look it up.""?  You're killing your own fun.  How many times have you just zoomed through the content to get to end game? What are your priorities?


For me, it's an MMO, it's time consuming. That is the POINT. i'm no fan of korean style grinding at all. But I don't mind spending time in game to learn and explore and appreciate the art and the sense of exploration.


We're a culture that has learned to run from one quest hub to another. We literally don't know how to entertain ourselves in between anymore.  MMOs give us, hopefully, a somewhat open world. And we run linear paths through it. Quest hub---monster area---quest hub. next quest hub---monster area---town.


If you say, well, I don't have TIME for that, maybe MMOs are not right for you. Maybe it isn't the games that are failing you, maybe you've lost the spirit of what MMOs are. I don't want to log into a game to do a laundry list of things. I mean, I can be goal oriented, but I'm not logging in because I *want* to kill 15 spiders or bring back 10 bottles of wine to the town drunk. I am logging in because I want to explore. If these quests happen on the way, then cool.  I am looking for the larger story, but I'm not going to be ruled by these petty ass quests.


By the time a game launches, I often feel like I've already played it, either due to beta testing, or just to extensive youtube searching. of course, no one is forcing us to read these guides or participate in betas. but we desperately want to know everything.  We're looking up stat calculators and boss encounter mechanics and just ruining our own sense of accomplishment on the way.


So, I did something different. I have been looking for a ""new"" mmo to play. I went through this helpful list on the sidebar here and just made a decision. What I didn't do was look up a bunch of shit about the games beyond a maybe 5 minute synopsis.


I chose Age of Conan and I went into it UTTERLY blind.  I love it. I, did, in fact, get ""that feeling"". It is partially because the game is somewhat low pop out in the starter zone (I think?) and I had to figure my own shit out, and partly because I got my ass handed to me a couple of times by monsters I thought I could take. But it is mostly because I know very little about the game. 


I have been taking it somewhat slow and actually letting the cutscenes build the scenarios for me.  


I like that I seem to be able to be a bit evil. And I like the fact that women run around topless. It's not a g rated game, and I am happy with that. seems a bit more realistic.


Anyway. I just wanted to share my thoughts on ""that feeling"" I read so much about.


I know this going into a game blind doesn't work very well when you have to drop $60 on the game and maybe a sub on top of that. But, in the future, I am certainly going to limit my obsessive knowledge collecting about games before they launch just so that I can appreciate what I discover when I get into the game.


TL;DR: Got Age of Conan, had fun because I knew nothing about it.

I just discovered it today, and decided to try going on a live chat with customer service. I explained to them that I messed up and I knew it was my fault, but asked if anything could be done. They gladly sympathized and gave me a refund for the last 5 months of charges.

So long story short, goddamn. NCsoft is an awesome company. I would totally play their games now if I wasn't a busy college student."	t5_2qlxw	True

So, I decided to create my own fansite forum about this game, but the community is very small right now, so I think few people have even (if any) visited the page. I have been in contact with the developers, and I have some nice screenshots to leak, but I will only do that if people join the forum ;D

So, Link for video trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDhimjJLc6c

Fan Website: http://www.blackdesertspoint.8forum.net

Developers: http://www.facebook.com/Pearl.Abyss.Black.Desert?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts

Have fun! And have a happy new year!

(I'll stay here as well :&gt;)

Edit: The developers are still looking for hosts outside Korea, if you know any good publisher in US/EU/SEA/etc, please contact them and tell them to look up Black Deserts. This is our chance to influence PearlAbyss to choose a good company!

Edit2: Also, don't forget to sign up the forum from the Fan Website I made up. I have some screenshots which, so far I know, have never been seen before on public ;)... But they might be somewhere, I don't know, but I haven't found all of them! If the forum gets 10 members, I will post my current favourite screen^^

1356355487.0	15dful	/r/MMORPG, it's time we stand up for MMOs.	trashmouth	42	11	80	"I've seen so many comments and posts lately about MMOs losing that sense of community that made us all love MMOs in the first place. The fact is, MMOs have become just regular games where NPCs are replaced with real people who have even less dialog, and players quickly get burnt out. With auto-grouping and things like that, there is really no reason to talk to other players anymore.

I want you to think back to all of your fond memories from MMOs. They almost *all* involve TALKING and getting along with other players, don't they? Every MMO that I have played and stuck with I have made friends on and that's why I stayed. I'm sure plenty of you are the same way. Working together and making friends with other PCs is what MMOs are all about, and many people have forgotten this.

This is why I think it's time that we as a subreddit did something to give us a sense of community. I have an idea, and I'm sure we're all open to any other ideas to bring back the love we all once had for MMOs.

Let's, as a subreddit, choose an MMO to play together. Let's get together, make a guild, and make friends. Let's talk to other players too, and just try to perpetuate a community outside of just ourselves. We can use this post here to upvote an MMO to play. Who's with me?

**Edit:** Alright, so to make this more organized, I want you all to post any suggestion you have for an MMO for us to all play. Make sure it has not been suggested yet. If it has, upvote the comment of the one you want to play. Suggestions can be b2p, f2p, or p2p, it doesn't matter. On **December 27th at 11:59 PM CST** The game with the most upvotes will be the one we will play. If you refuse to play with us simply because of the game choice, you have missed the point of this post. We are not here to find the best MMO and play it, we are here to try and start a trend of active communities in MMOs. If you do not join us, I urge you to promote the same idea in whatever game you play.

I agree with many when they say that WoW has killed the genre because nothing can compare to it - but the game itself is stale. I've looked for many different MMOs to occupy my time with, some over the years and some post-WoW. The only MMO post-WoW that I can tolerate is Rift, but Rift has serious performance issues on my computer so I can't play.

Is anybody else stuck in a state of not being able to play one MMO before getting bored? I can't find a single game that's worth playing past the first few levels.

***Please share your ideas down below, I made it reader friendly for people to easily skip sections if needed***

This idea is to get an understanding of what people like about MMORPGs and mash them together making something incredibly enjoyable. All of which would be hypothetically done through a closed open-community project. I will refer to this game as being **RMMORPG** (Reddit-MMORPG).

**Buy To Play, Un-breaking Subscription service**

**One server:**

**No Gear Grind**

**No Levels**

**Significant Skilling**

**Everything Effects Everything:** Choices must be made and choices have consequences 

**Characters:**

* **Races:**  From what I read on the thread and online races would have some variation as having ones that people have seen before and some originality to others. Races would have each have their own characteristics.

* **Classes?**:  For the majority point there is no classes but for starting sake you get a choice and upon entering the game you decide whether to stick with that class type or not. 

* **Customizing:** Everything on the character can be customized. Color and size of nearly everything. Possibly body characteristics. 


Everything within your choice would affect how NPCs and how you move within the game. You make your character fat? You will be slower. That scar on your face makes you intimidating towards certain people. 

* **Beginning Out:** After Character creation a player will be randomly placed in a random city. This will take away from having a beginners area. Each city will have roughly the same tutorial (difference will be location) and will go through all in-game content. Players will venture out to their liking and will meet people randomly. 

**Environment:**

* **Open World:**

* **Massive World Size:**

* **Dynamic Weather:**

* **Dynamic Seasons:**

* **Partially Dynamic Terrain:**

* **Cities/Towns:** Civilization will vary per area. based on the size and type of town will bring different content.

* **Realms:** This is like same concept the anime Swords Art Online had (I believe Mortal Kombat also does something like this). For everyone not familiar though the idea of having different ""zones"" to go too. The difference with this is that each Realm would be equal in size but have different content to give and NPCs could react towards you in a different way. 

**Graphics**

* **Textures:** Everyone is given their opinion. Some like realism while others like a cartoon feel.  I have came down to the conclusion that this game will have a more Realism look. 
* **Low End:** Not everyone has the best computer and in order to appeal to the majority there will be some pretty low end specs to run the game. Anything from taking particles out from lowering viewable content

* **High End:** Think of it like this...It will test the specs of a well built gaming PC. 

**Combat:**

* **Melee, Magic, and Range:**  Each would have a tree of variety of skills

**Skills(non-combat):**

* **Wide range of skills**

**Crafting system:** This needs to be unique in many ways. 

* **Specific craftable items:**

* **Random Craftable Items:**

**Karma:**

**Factions:**

**Questing:**

* **Main:** there will be more than 1 main quests all of which factor in choice made throughout the game

* **Area Based**

* **Skill Based**

* **Lore Based**

* **Voice Actors:** Gives some personality to the quests while helps those who aren't up for reading. All quests will have audio and if you aren't up for reading it or listening then skip through.  

**PVE and PVP:** From my understanding people love both concepts. So instead of having separate servers for each why not combine the two into a thrilling game. Areas will be permanent PVE while others Permanent PVP, but I do think an algorithm could be created that allows for areas to change their stances. This will allow for random ambushes to be possible. Here is the catch though there will be no indicator if an area is PVE or PVP. Only signs within the game can tell you. 

**Wildlife (Monsters and Animals/Creatures):**

* **Hostility:** Not everything is hostile towards you but if you agitate it then it might attack you.  

* **Simple non-aggressive monsters:** These monsters can be used for practice and to gather items for skills

* **Hostile Monsters:** These are set monsters/beings which will always attack you

* **BAMs:** (Big Ass Monsters)- I know many Korean games you this as a big majority of their games to describe what is challenging but these won't be it.

* **Godlike Beings:**  Everything out there has creatures that have become into some belief that they are gods. This will be the case and these beings will be strong but not immortal when you have enough groups fighting it. 

**Dungeons**

These are what don't stay true to the open world environment. They are all based upon who enters.

* **Generating:** Some dungeons (Not all but most) will be created through some complex algorithm

* **Traps and Puzzles:** Along with monsters and bosses dungeons can hold traps and puzzles that people have to conquer in order to move through sections. 

* **Player-Creation:** This is sort of a skill based upon dungeons that have been tackled you will learn of the mechanisms used and the monsters within them. This allows for you to create your own dungeons. Dungeons can be publicized or can keep private for only friends. The dungeon lead can take on the dungeon or look over it and put given unknowns that the creator has specified for the it.  If the Creator  allows it their dungeon can be saved by other players. 


**Traveling:**  /u/gordianus1 
&gt;No fast travel, if you want to travel rent a horse, or boat to cross ocean and land mass.
	
I agree with it actually so to add to it. Yes there will be teleportation spells  and teleportation devices. Possibly scrolls that can be found. There will be ways of getting around but simple fast travel will not be in.

**Social Groups**

* **Guilds:** just like most MMOs there will be player made guilds which will have a variety of things they can do

* **Clans:** Separate from a Guild something of which is less permanent but can be necessary.
* **Partying:** You can party with certain amount of people in order to tackle creatures and quests

**Guilds:**

* **Size:** I would love to say a guild can have as many players as possible but we all need to be realistic here and say this cannot be the case. I think a compromising size for such a game would be **500** and to start and keep a guild you can have no less than 20 people.

* **Headquarters/Housing:** Every guild needs a base. So upon entering you can buy land to build a base. Guild housing will be castle like form which comes in various sizes. The more people you have the larger your castle can be. Warning owners your castle has upkeep costs.

* **GvG:** it is only appropriate to say that this is possible then. GvG is allowed anywhere unless the area is simply a non-battle zone(PERIOD). 

* **Requirement costs:** This doesn't necessarily need to be part of a guild...but if your swordsmanship and magic aren't up to par to what the guild wants....sorry pal try again. (&lt;&lt;example)




**Chat Options**

* **Global:** This will only be allowed for subscription users in order to keep botting down while also saying  you got to pay to troll. 

* **Realm:** Given people variety...

* **Area:** this is just as blunt as can be...simply the area you inhibit at the time

* **Guild:** Since guilds will be huge this can be monitored depending how you like. For instance there will be the general guild chat but also you can make be just for higher positioned people. All depends how the owner limits it.

* **Privatizing:** This is a way to limit people into your chat. For instance a party of randoms and some guildies want to chat together or clan mates and such. OOORR this can also be used for Roleplaying. A person can set up a chat and it can be invite only or limited to a set of people. Customization is endless

* **Private Messages:**  Not exactly a chat option but more like a postage option. But if you feel the need to inform a friend of something when he/she logs on then you have that possibility. 

* **Much More:** Variety of tabs, colors of text, password chats, Clan Chats. 

**Political System**

You are all thinking, Tera?, you are taking the Vanarch system of Tera?. No not exactly this is more random and balanced but the whole idea did come from it. Bare with me here. 

* **Who you vote in:**  You are not voting in any player user. No your votes all go towards NPC of  cities. There will be maybe a hundred or so NPCs who are allowed to be voted in. Voting is all based upon the players though

* **What happens:** Simply each NPC will choose how the taxes  are laid out. No one will know for sure but based upon how the NPC acts there will be a general concept of how they would rule to be formed. 

* **Crime:** These also affect crime rates. NPC crime and Player crime and depending on who is in charge will affect how guards react. 

* **Over-time:** A NPC can be ruled in as much as the community does so but this also affects how they rule. 

* **Corruption:** It is possible a guild could have control of the political system in an area. It is also possible to buy out a ruler to end its term or possibly let your criminal sentence slide. 


**Bonus Content:** This is stuff I believe can be added to make the game be more social while also putting friendly quirks in there too.

* **Card Game:** Not all of us like card games but there are many that do. Why not add this into the mix. Playing the game collecting cards. Building up decks. Why not right?

* **Mini-Games:** I honestly do not have much examples for this other than Runescape. People like to have fun and these could change it up a bit

* **Gambling Games:** Not all of us like trying to break markets and build money from doing so, but we like to gamble instead, right? 

**Mobile Application**

Depending on where your character is will depend on how much you get to work your app.

If you are in the city you will get access to surrounding market content while also being able to get to city min-games. If you are in a small town you get access to content based on that town: this can be specific town driven content or maybe lore about the town itself

If you are in your house, you get to do various activities around it. 

Mini-game content- If you leave for a bathroom break never feel bad about having the other person wait!

There is always the ability to access guild/clan/party and private chats with it. Even private messages.

I've tried nearly every large/""next big"" mmo since and even a few WoW private servers; A Vanilla, TBC and even WoTLK. All suffered problems, mostly population. None got me even close to those feelings.

I feel like these feelings are lost forever and only to be remembered and reminisced with friends. 

Sometimes I still get those urges to hop on with friends and have a good time, only there is nobody and the WoW in those memories, from those days, is gone. It kinda bums me out when that happens

 So to any ex-WoW players out out there. Have you managed to recapture those feelings from the ""good old times"" of WoW or are these feelings lost to us forever? If you have, share your story.

Star Wars Galaxies was a popular MMO when it was released, because of the ""open"" concept that it had. Involving things like a player economy, cities, guilds and completely open planets and space.

SWG was a successful sandbox game with a thriving community, but as the years went on (And Fambaa hunts disappeared), for some reason the developers of the game saw how good WoW was doing, and decided to take some elements (Like a level system) and implement them into SWG, which basically alienated the previously loyal user base.

The Emulator project, aims to launch a playable SWG platform, based on before the New Game Enhancements, to give players a truly sandbox Star Wars esque game to play on. With the recent release of SWOTOR, and its linear storyline, some Star Wars fans ache for the good old days when they could just go out in the wilderness, explore, set up a camp and play a tune.

The Emulator project is in its Beta phase, with a semi-playable version of SWG available to test and to try. The developers need money and testers to continue with this ongoing project, please follow the link and find out more, you can buy old copies of SWG on Amazon, however there are many other ways of acquiring it.

No quests, nobody telling you what to do (except the law of course). People trained to be sheriffs, marketers, barmen, farmers, etc... etc... You could get in with bandits if you wanted to.

GeekAesthete	31	4	66	"I'm teaching a course on interactive media this fall, and among the various games that I'm assigning, choosing an MMORPG has proven the most difficult, as I have not kept up with MMOs in recent years (Star Wars Galaxies was the last MMO I put any serious time into, and MMOs are generally outside my realm of expertise -- I spend much more time in single-player games), so I wonder whether /r/MMORPG can offer some suggestions.

Costs are a factor -- my students are going to be required to purchase several games, so I'd like to keep their costs low, but I'd be willing to require a reasonable 1- or 3-month subscription if it seems worthwhile (I've considered a month of EVE Online, for instance, but wonder whether we'd get much out of the game in such short time). On the other hand, if I can choose a free-to-play game that is worth our time, all the better (as this would let us play the game casually throughout the semester rather than concentrating our time all at once).

Some other considerations: we're only going to play one MMORPG together as a class, so I want to pick one that is a good representation of the genre, but since we'll be investing a good bit of time into playing it, I also want it to be worthwhile in its own right (especially for low-level players -- we won't be playing long enough to get very good at it). The class is equally split between men and women, so I do want something that will appeal to both genders if possible. And, since the majority of students will not be MMO veterans (and in some cases, have little gaming experience at all), I want something that will be accessible to noobs.

Thanks!

EDIT: I neglected to mention technical issues: I *should* choose a game that's available for both Windows and Mac, as I'll undoubtedly have students who own both, and it should be at least functional on an underwhelming laptop, as many of them won't have high-end rigs. We spend two hours each week in a computer lab, so we will be playing a little on better machines, but for playing at home, it shouldn't be too demanding."	t5_2qlxw	True

Now to explain more, for those that have referred to it as ""Pay-to-win"".

I've played through some of the betas (have been burnt out in MMO Beta testing before, didn't want to do the same here).  I have been playing since the game released last Thursday.  I originally paid for a founder's pack, but then received a refund, because financially other things came up.  I was surprised that I got an e-mail saying I would have early access, which that was pretty cool.

I'm not level cap yet, and I have made over 400k AD without trying.  Using the AH, doing dailies, doing the scheduled events (i.e. AD bonus from skirmishes), praying hourly, and sending companions out on leadership missions.  And I've only put roughly 24 hours into the game.  I can only imagine what it'll be like at 60.  If you look at the game as ""you must pay to get things"", then yeah, it'll be pay-to-win.  But it is so incredibly easy to save up AD and buy Zen.  If the market changes, that'll be one thing, and only time will tell what happens.  However, as it stands right now, if with a day played out of an entire week, allows me to buy a respec and some change, for a game I have put $0 into, that doesn't sound very pay-to-win to me.

I'm sure there are those who disagree with me, and will point out that people can buy AD with zen, my question is, why do you care?  People could do that in WoW, just through third party companies (and I know quite a lot of people who took advantage of it) while BUYING the game and then paying a subscription.  

It happened in Diablo 2, people buying runes and bugged gear, after paying for the game.

A lot of people will point at Guild Wars 2, and say ""why don't they do what they did"" (which isn't free to play, it just doesn't have a subscription).  I bought Guild Wars 2, and had a blast throughout it.  But when I got to the end game, I couldn't stand it.  I had spent $60 on this game, played through the content to finally hit 80, and I could not enjoy the endgame almost at all.  I was pretty frustrated, and was out $60.  And while they release content now, they will be releasing an expansion, which will probably be selling for $40~$60 itself.  Neverwinter doesn't charge that initial fee, and doesn't require you to spend a cent.  Some players will want to take advantage of the Microtransaction store, and more power to them.  If they want to buy some BoE off the AH, and they don't have the time to invest in farming, it's either buy from the company producing the game, or they'll look for some third party to pay off and do the work for them.  Either way, some people are willing to pay so they don't have to put any work into a game, they'll find a way, because someone will step up and provide that.  If the company that owns the game steps up and says ""fuck it, we'll legitimize it"" and gets rid of a middle man, it all the sudden becomes ""greedy company makes pay 2 win games"".

I'm not fanboying (if this were Wildstar, it'd be a different story), but the MMO f2p model relies on this, and this one seems to be incredibly balanced, especially compared to what is out there.

I'll probably receive a lot of hate, but if you look at how much a lot of people play games, and how little effort it takes to succeed in this game without paying a cent, it's pretty easy to see balance.  If you get upset, because someone bought some sword, then you should avoid MMO's, because it happens everywhere.

Edit: [In response to another thread where someone brought up League of Legend's model, and why F2P MMO's charge the way they do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1dlywp/respecing_in_neverwinter_costs_6_are_you_kidding/c9s06xf)"	t5_2qlxw	True

When I played WoW for the first time in 2004, I was blown away by the game genre. I was curious to explore, and anxious to progress my character.

I have this home-made hypothesis, that this feeling can only be felt once. After playing for a while (years I guess), you get the general idea of characters and big digital worls, and the feeling can never be achieved again. Not in an expansion, and not in another MMORPG.

I'm curious if I'm wrong or right (or something inbetween).

Do you think it can be felt more than once? Have you felt it twice? Was that in two different MMORPGs? Was it after a long break?

Personally I think/guess playing has a disillusionising effect. Similar to how it's difficult to start believing in Santa again. It becomes impossible to pull the curtain in front of your eyes.

Why do I ask this? I think some players link this positive feeling to vanilla WoW, and unwittingly they think vanilla WoW was better than any of the expansions.

A Fantasy-MMORPG based on the mechanics of music.	axcess07	23	0	11	"Stumbled upon this game on /r/indiegaming and I think the premise sounds fun and engaging (teacher side of me coming out), but I wonder how musical mechanics could translate into a major MMORPG.  I'm almost willing to bet it's going to be more MMO than anything, but the idea of players creating music with musical weapons sounds refreshing (Dat violin in the video, so cool!)  Especially since they can credit those involved and upload the music into the game itself for others to use.  Though the concept art looks freaking beautiful, I hope the Unity engine will be able to replicate their ambitious artwork.

[Website](http://www.theanthymn.com/)

[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/37002837/anthymn) - I think asking for $600,000 will discourage backers.

**From their website for those on mobile**

* **THE STORY -** Anthymn’s story follows a young maestro, Tiarnen, who is trying to write the first national anthymn in hopes of uniting the land of Chora before its provinces are shattered by civil war. The choices made throughout your adventures will either help complete the anthymn or destroy it forever.

* **THE MUSIC -** Anthymn’s music, much like Chora itself, is based on orchestral movements and classical modes. Each of the provinces has been shaped by a musical genre to allow your personal style and preferences to not only forge a unique identity in Anthymn.

* **THE EDUCATION -** No matter which class or instrument you choose, there is a full series of lessons available to help you weave tone, chord and melody into warsongs. Once created, the entire Anthymn community will be able to publish, share and wield their warsongs together in battle.

**From Kickstarter for those on mobile.**

* Anthymn's story unfolds across the continent of Chora

* Chora is divided into 8 unique provinces with their own musical race and culture

* The provinces are engulfed in civil war, their maestros and champions are leading campaigns against each other in order to prove whose musical style is the most powerful

* One maestro, Tiarnen, believes there is a way to end the war peacefully by uniting the provinces under a national anthymn

* You will choose a province and character class based on your own music preferences in order to help complete the anthymn and unite the provinces or shatter them forever

* The game will be developed with the Unity engine for PC, Mac and Linux

* English, French, Spanish, German, Korean, Mandarin, Japanese languages will be available

* The game will be distributed DRM-free in both box and digital download versions"	t5_2qlxw	True

The hard part is that none of the current mmo choices are fitting the bill. I might just have unrealistic expectations. I'm not sure, I might.


1. I'm done playing wow. I have been on it since vanilla and basically quit in the beginning of cata. Now the numbers are too large to even matter. Bosses with 1 trillion hp?


1. The Secret World seems like a really great idea. The whole theme of it. I'm into it. The issue for me is the gameplay. The system of building any way you want. Not really. A lot of the skills are hokey. The combat is stiff and the UI bothers my eyes.


3. Guild Wars 2 was probably my largest heartbreak. I followed it as early as I could. It was amazing. The quests were going to be fun. The game was designed for pvp. What I ended up seeing was a mmo fashion show. The end game is pointless. The PvE fights are large clusterfucks. There are things to do but everything is so grind-y(?). WvWvW doesn't interest me at all. All it is is zerging. The traits aren't balanced well in my opinion either.


4. Star Wars The Old Republic was a great idea butchered. The one class I was interested in playing was the scoundrel and the cover system made me want to kill myself. It was okay for pve and in pvp it made you a sitting duck. Now it's free to play. There is now basically no gate to remove the casuals from those who actually wanted to be objective. At least be pay to play so people can't just spam accounts.


5. Rift interested me. It was neat that you basically pick the archetype you like. From there you have a variety of play styles to choose from. Neat. Barely has a community. Also, the theme isn't really my cup of tea but I don't let cosmetics bother me that much.


6. Never touched TERA. An fpsmmo didn't sound appealing.


7. Defiance was a gimmick game. Didn't take off as I expected. On steam it has less people playing than that Warframe game.


8. Path of Exile doesn't have an end game. It's basically Diablo that you start over and over with different build ideas. The racing part seemed comical.

In Development/beta there are a few games I'm hopeful for. Neverwinter seems okay. I like the idea of player created content. If actually moderated it will be a source of infinite content. However, I'm not sure if players will have tools needed to make quality content. Also, not thrilled with what requires actual cash in these games. Final Fantasy XIV:ARR is something I've been having my eye on. I didn't like the first incarnation. The controls and the user friendliness were out of the window. It was ported to pc to use on a gamepad. Bad idea. A good idea from them was allowing one character to level as every class or job. Very neat. It really feels like it's going to be that anime based on an mmo Sword Art Online. I'm hearing from testers that the controls are not forgiving and that the global cooldown really hampers the game. We'll see.

All this is pretty much why I can't settle in on an mmo. I like bits and pieces from all of them but none of them make me want to play."	t5_2qlxw	True

1366139641.0	1ch9p0	Veteran gamer looking for a PvP Mmorpg	AxlJones	24	3	50	"Hey everyone,

I've been on a brake from mmorpgs for a few months and i'm looking for a new heavily focused pvp game to play on. 

I can spend 15h+ a week gaming, like big sandboxy fantasy/medieval games with lots of pvp (open world pvp is a really big plus). I'm really not a big fan of lore, instanced raids and pve in general.

Here's an exhaustive list of MMOs i've already tried/played:

*WoW (full season 2 glad when i sold my account, i loved the arenas gameplay and open world ganking)

Knight online (played a few years before wow, absolutely loved the big pvp map and the invasion. The invasion being one of the most thrilling gaming experience i've ever had)

Guild wars 2 (got 2 80s but i find the pvp very boring and linear; people mostly have the same gear and hardcore gamers barely get rewarded)

Champions Online (got a few characters at max level)

Bloodlines champions (played almost every day for a few weeks)

LoL (full 2009 year)

Hon (almost a year)

Diablo3

PoE

Age of conan (played a week 2 years ago)

Lineage 2 

Tera (only played at very low levels so far)

Eve online

DayZ

WarZ

There are a few games coming out this year that i'm closely watching (archeage,wildstar, dayz and black desert) but for now, i don't know which game to play.

I've noticed the new darkfall just came out and it looks pretty good from trailers but it also received very bad reviews from beta testers.

Anyway, what do you think?

1360536188.0	189r8w	Trouble sticking to MMO's. Trouble letting go.	mistertor13	25	3	37	"So I've played WoW since release, and I loved it, but here and there I want to try out newer MMO's. For about six years I managed hold my guild comprised of real life friends together, but we fell apart for the last time after first teir of Cata raiding. Since then I've hopped between guilds but none of them are the same, they all have their clique and I'm the outsider. 

So I jump from game to game. At the moment, I've played/I play:

DCUO, SWTOR, GW2, Tera, Rift, WoW, Planteside2, and Diablo 3. I have different friends that play each one. I have at least one max character in all the games, but usually a lot of alts too. Especially WoW, I have a server with max level 85s (but only 2x 90s).

My problem is this: After all this time, I'm burning out on Daily quests, while at the same games that have no linear drive (GW2), just can't seem to suck me in.

I feel guilty when I ""Should be playing XXX"" to do the daily/weekly or whatever, so that I'll have a decent character. 

Take WoW, this week the Darkmoon faire was on, I SHOULD have been levelling an alt, because of the efficiency provided from the XP boost, but instead I just bummed around on Tera. I couldn't be bothered playing WoW, I'm over it, but at the same time I can't let go because I've done it for so long.

Moreso, I don't stick to one game because my friends are so scattered, but I miss the big guild joy. I don't have that much play time, so when I do I want to be making the most of it. 

I can't play single player games at all anymore because they don't have the same sense of acheivement that MMO's do.

I guess I'm burning out, but being a gamer is all I've known. A lot of my friends have quit completely. I try, but by god I need the escape.

TL;DR. Play too many MMOs. Not enough time to play them, getting burned out feeling obligated to play. Having trouble letting go of old mmo's like WoW.

I hope there's someone out there like me, what the hell do you do?!"	t5_2qlxw	True

I've been jumping through a couple of games, and I've found that my healing experience is different in each. Some I find immensely boring, some frustrating, some very fun, and some, eh.


Then I've been thinking, hey, I wonder what other people think about healing in different games.

Me, personally, I think the most fun I've had playing a healer class was in Iris Online. In Iris Online, not only did I have to keep up with healing, there's also tons of debuffs I had to get rid of. So I was constantly on my toes healing and removing debuffs. I'm, what you would call a healbot. I have a bad habit of, if there is nothing to heal, just sit there. Iris Online helped me keep up my healbot habits, ahah, which is probably why i had most fun (plus there was a mermaid/fishy outfit and I love my fishies).

I also recall having a lot of fun playing the healer in Dragon Saga/Dragonica, but it's been a long time and I can't remember exactly why.

As for hated healing, well, there was one game, the name has slipped my mind, all I remember about it was that there was a system where you could make your own dance emotes. But yes, that game, I've never felt so useless as a healer. My heals did nearly nothing, and my party members kept dying, they had to use potions themselves, I couldn't keep up even with focusing only one person, and this is at a dungeon that everyone my level was going to! Not sure if that was only because it was still early game but I hated feeling useless. Plus I did poop damage so I couldn't contribute much.


So, what was your healer experiences? I'm interested in seeing how some games made healers more or less fun."	t5_2qlxw	True

The whole gameplay is very limited – you buy potions, go to dungeon, kill some mobs, you either survive the Boss or die. Doesn’t matter. You might up your level in your one gaming session. Doesn’t matter. No matter what you do, you will be forced into these patterns. 

When we first started working on a mobile MMO, we had this &lt;cliche&gt;vision&lt;/cliche&gt;, that you can play interesting MMOs without the help of PC or laptop. All you need is your phone or tablet, and you’re good to go. Throwing lanparties is as easy as just having your friends over. 

Instead, the mobile MMOs follow the path of any other mobile games – you play them while you are in the bathroom. Instead of revolutionizing the whole gaming experience, this has become a start for a whole new era of castrated MMOs of 5-10 minute long gaming sessions. 

We decided that your mobile devices deserve a complete, desktop like MMO experience and we need your help. Our studio has started a campaign on  [indiegogo](http://igg.me/at/DestinyOfAres/x/2576851) and we will be happy to receive your every dollar to make this vision come true.

1365102724.0	1boh3u	The next big MMO?	homeless_in_london	20	1	77	"I've never really been a big gamer, the only game that's really become a wanted addiction was WoW, but every time I return it just feels like it's lost that sense of magic. 

I used to wander around Azeroth getting up to all sorts, after I came home from school it was never ""what game shall I play tonight"" but rather ""what shall I do on WoW tonight"" but if I get back into the game and play anywhere near the amount I used to play everything is done, and the things that aren't done aren't rewarding at all. I'm sure you've all heard it before but WoW definitely feels like it's dumbed down, but I'm not sure if I'm just getting older. I was 15-18 when I played the most and now I'm 22, but back then I knew of plenty of people much older than I am now who played almost religiously.

Granted, I was a lot younger then, but I'm still hoping a new MMORPG will come along and fill me with a sense of wonder again, but there doesn't seem to be one on the horizon, the only one that looks promising to me is Oblivion Online, and even then... meh.

Is there anything that anyone on here is excited about? And am I being a fool for thinking anything like vanilla/BC WoW will ever come along again? I mean WoW had everything, you could spend weeks reading the lore, years playing the game, people always complained about the PVP but I found it amazing, the raids were challenging, the forums were really active and each server had a very strong community feel, not to mention all of the unofficial communities like AJ.

There's plenty of franchises out there that have the expanded universe that a great MMO needs, but they all just feel like half-hearted attempts to steal some revenue from WoW, which itself has blatantly turned into a cash cow for Blizzard. The way Acti-Blizz is going I'm not sure how Titan will turn out, I doubt it'll be as pure as Vanilla/BC. I know people love to romanticise vanilla WoW but I really do think Vanilla and BC were the pinnacle of MMORPGs, all the ingredients were there and Blizz pulled it off so well."	t5_2qlxw	True

So, today an old friend of mine came to me and said that he was giving me back my character, which I had sold to him for a small amount of money. He explained to me that he was deleting his other char, and that he no longer needed the one I sold to him, and he was giving me back. After I said that he should just deleted both, he said he was giving it back to me anyways, and that I shouldn't delete it, if for nothing else, for the memory.


It touched me a lot, because I really liked that Char, but it was just that, a mmorpg character - Yes I had lots of fun playing it , I met lots and lots of cool, honest, warming people. One of the funniest and coolest person I've ever met til this very day, I met  playing that game in that exact character. But, this wasn't just a regular character. 

You see, when I first started playing this game (I'll tell you which game it's at the end, don't worry) - this cash game - I was very weak, and I knew so little about this game. The forums didn't help much, because they didn't have much to teach you.


So I tried messaging some of the higher levels and tried to talk to them. All of them ignored me until I was about level 60 http://imageshack.us/a/img545/6269/arvores.png  and already knew a LOT about the game (the highest level at the time was 100+-) and was actually teaching them, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

So, high levels didn't want to teach me shit, so I went and looked for forums in english (I'm Brazilian and my native language is portuguese), to see what they had to teach me, for my surprise this game didn't 'exist' in a english version. So I tried looking for other versions of it, I don't remember how, but I end up finding 2 things. First a Chinese Version and second a Vietnamise version. The name of the game, in both version were Fun City (different from the brazilian one) and I used google to translate their forum to english and found the Tutorial/Guides section of their forums. I msg'd some random people asking for help (everything in english) and gave them my MSN. A chinese guy actually asnwered me, and he said I should add him in Skype and we both should talk (you see I can write just fine in english, but I can't really speak it, I've a hard time speaking english, but it's getting better). Well we chatted, a lot, he was from the same class as me in the game ( hunter/summoner type).

http://imageshack.us/a/img132/1063/dragonkk.jpg

He ended up teaching every little thing I had to know about the game... He taught me how to make lots of money without the need to buy Cash, he taught me the best skills to teach my pet, the best ways to level, how to equip myself (you see, this was a very 'poor' graphically game, but it was full of amazing things and secrets). He taught almost everything there was to know about my class, and he did it patiently (most of the time) and I'm very grateful to him to this very day. He even lend me one of his char, so I could login and play with him ( a level 100 char ) .

Well, time went by, I got stronger in the game, became one of the top 20 in the ranking level, had the most amazing pet in the game (everyone wanted to have one like mine)

 taught lots and lots of things to people, kept somethings secret... Made 3 really, really good friends and level'd with them from 60 to 100,  and taught a lot of my secrets to them too.

(Met a lot more cool people like the guy I sold the char, but he stopped playing and came back later so he didn't made so much history).

Well, we started a war in the server. The reason? Well some guys had power abused me a long long time ago, it all started as a little battle and I lost a lot, but them I got stronger and started to bully him day and night, posted screenshots in forums

, talked trash (dunno the right word), made a fuss.. Well some people bought his fight, it ended up being a war...

Some time passed, one of my friends meets this girl (which we help to level up, he becomes crazy in love with her, fight with us later and bla bla bla) we help her out, she gets about the same level as us, but she is this manipulative *****. 

Anyways, we get tired of it all, we already have had lots of fun, and we decided to quit - 3 of us quit in the same day. Said good by in the forums, people cried, some said we were bluffing. In the end that was it. Legacy was over - We had no other reason to keep playing, it was a waste of time (and money for some of us) because we were the best, we knew all the secrets, we had won so many battle, and we made history so fast (about 4 to 6 months playing, while people were playing for a year or more) and so intense that it didn't matter anymore.

Well, I decided that I would post all of my secrets in the forum ( I already had posted like 80% of them), because I always benefited from forums (ragnarok, tibia, wow, etc, etc) but I never had really teach a lot. This time it was going to be different, I had shared a lot, taught a lot, and I was going to teach everything that was left to teach. I made my decision and told the others. 1 of them didn't like it very well (it was the one that was going to keep playing, and was in love with the girl and Yadda yadda yadda - he was the scared one anyways, he always hesitated to jump into a fight, and skipped most of them).

Well, time goes by and here I'm... Telling my story to you guys. There is so much more that I had to skip just to make it easier for you guys to read.

In the end, this was my second REALLY AWESOME experience with MMOs. My frist was with Tibia, 11 years ago, my first mmorpg and I had a great time there. And this time (about 2 years ago) I had the change to meet all thoose awesome people, make awesome friends who I want to meet in real life, made a lot of fights and wars, and laughed so fucking much...

I just had to share it here, because in the end, in a good mmo comunity, it doesn't matter how much we fight and make war, there is a respect and almost a friendship with the people we make war. Because we DON'T hate them, we just have to fight to defend our interest, but it really doesn't matter in the end because it's just a GAME and everything end ups being good memories... I know this because that is how I feel about everyone I met, friend or foe, and I talked with thoose people sometime later and they all had good memories of our wars and battles...

Have Fun Guys and I hope you like it.

Ah, the name of the game in portuguese is Magic Campus (same name for the english server, that exists now). I really hope you guys like it."	t5_2qlxw	True

I see so many people complaining about modern-day MMO's (hey, I'm one of them), but I rarely see people explaining what they really want at the end of the day. It's almost to the point where I'm convinced it's impossible to please some of these players.

So... what do you want? What mechanics, gameplay, and world would make it an ideal environment for you, that current games just don't offer?

**My own take:** I want a game with deep customization, huge open world PvP with locations to conquer, and action combat.

Guild Wars 2 is the only game that's come close as of late, but it sort of misses the mark on action combat. 

It's World vs World area is VERY fun, and well designed. Taking out supply camps that can hinder keeps, siege weapons, all the secret passage-ways, etc... it's just a dream come true for my open world PvP fantasies. And the character customization is obviously fantastic for that game.

But the combat.. eh. It's still sort of living in the ""tab target and hit buttons as they light up"" era. I'm just kinda done with those games, having played them since EQ1 and FFXI. What I want is something more like Tera; let me manually aim, let me physically block with my shield. I want something that feels more involving. I'll admit Guild Wars 2 is a bit of a step up from the old MMO's, but not as much as I want.

Anyone else? 

**EDIT:** Should probably mention that my opinion above actually has somewhat come true with Planetside 2. And I actually play it quite a bit! But I'd also prefer something more fantasy based."	t5_2qlxw	True

1361920469.0	19aft6	Perpetuum, the Robot Sandbox MMO.	Ostanage	18	1	9	"http://www.perpetuum-online.com/ 

So if you like Sandbox MMOs and Robots, this is a pretty sweet game. It's similar to EvE where it's a Player Driven Economy (Miners gather stuff, people build robots and modules, they go boom, rinse and repeat). Also, the skills are similar, but you accumulate points over time and then upgrade the skill. 

It's a fairly low population game and still needs some work, however it's defiantly worth trying and investing. The owners of the game plan on releasing a large patch in the near future and it's close to going live on Steam. This also means there is plenty of opportunity for new players to join and start some pvping without getting blobbed to death instantly. There's also plenty opportunity to build up the economy if that is your forte as well. 

There's plenty of land to be claimed and more so to knock out others.  

The community is great and helpful, give it a try and ask questions on the forums or public channels. Sometimes might catch a DEV or GM on as well in the General and Help Channels. 

Some other bonuses are: Alpha Islands are safe, you cannot be ganked nor can someone steal your Mining Can. Most corp leaders are not Egomaniacs that have everyone playing for their agenda. Gamma islands are very unique mechanic, you can shape the land how you see fit and build your own base. "	t5_2qlxw	True

http://spaceblasterx.blogspot.com/2013/02/why-i-will-never-buy-nexon-credit-again.html

**Why I won't buy NX Credit ever again:**


You would think that in the era of Free to Play games, companies would be intelligent about how they promote and get players to buy their products and try to make the system as convenient as possible.


I recently started playing Dragon Nest because I wanted a game to have fun with friends by running around bashing stuff in the face.  Simple.  And I personally have no problem chipping in a few bucks here and there for F2P games for some of the vanity stuff or bag upgrades and whatnot.  I understand it takes money to run the game and have no problem with the F2P model in general.


So, I am upset about how complicated the system is and how they force you to use systems that are plain stupid.  Let me explain:


In the game you get a starter package for your character, like other asian MMOs these give you coupons and potions and whatnot to help you get into the game.  Well I noticed I had a couple coupons for a discount on a permanent bag slot upgrades.


Although I didn't read it all the way through, I did notice it said that you can't buy with Nexon Credit.  Well, after clicking on it, it shows the discount with the NX icon and the remaining NX after the discount.  So it seems that if I buy the NX currency, then it wouldn't necessarily be credit.  After checking out the pricing I see that, Hey I could buy both discounted items for 5$.  Neat!  And I thought that this is a good way to get your players spending the in game currency by giving them some limited time discounts.  Good marketing, or so I thought.


So I buy the NX Credit, just five bucks worth, and find out, that only NX Prepaid, which I had no idea what that was, could be used to buy the discounted items.  Yes it says you cannot use NX Credit, but that makes no sense and I bought the currency and thought that 'Credit' meant you could charge it and pay it later.


So I'm like, well okay, I guess I have to get this prepaid shit and then get these discounts.  Well it turns out that getting the prepaid 'currency' requires me to either go physically buy a specific card at a store or sign up for this whole online cash transfer bullshit program that looks like a pain in the ass.


This system is a load of jack.  I may play their game still, but probably for not much longer, and I just don't understand this kind of marketing.  It would be VERY smart for them to give you discounts, make it quick and easy to just enter your card and get what you want, but instead, they make the system confusing and a pain in the ass.


Maybe I'm just cranky since I just got off work, but I know that I won't ever be buying Nexon Credit again since it's a load of crap and the 5$ I bought can't even buy any bag slot upgrades without a discount.


If you guys are planning on playing a Nexon game, just beware and read that shit thoroughly.  And Nexon, if you ever read this, please get better marketing guys, if it pisses me off, I'm sure it's gonna piss a lot more people off as well.  (I'm generally a pretty passive and forgiving person with this kind of stuff).


**TL;DR:  NX Credit is useless with some coupons they give you in the starting package, but getting the other currency is a pain the ass and shit's just confusing unless you go out of your way to read all this crap about the NX system.**"	t5_2qlxw	True

I want a game that has a low to moderate pay to win structure, meaning I don't mind if it is in the game, just not so heavily impacting the game.  

A game that is basically class-less, like Runescape, where everyone starts out the exact same in the beginning and branches out from there.

Don't care about game's popularity.

Prefer F2P as of now but am open to suggestions for P2P.

I mean no longer having leveling zones, and simply starting the game out running dungeons with groups and progressing into raid content, with nothing but the focus on gearing up.  
  

I personally play as many MMO's as i can get my hands on hoping to find the next best thing, and the leveling experience in pretty much everyone of them is almost exactly the same as the MMO's i played before it, and It's simply dreadfully boring.

During group content i get to actively meet new people, feel like I'm progressing ( leveling doesn't even feel like progress to me anymore ) and challenging myself with new boss encounters that are difficult to beat, learning strategies and genuinely having fun.

The entire leveling experience however, feels like a mindless grind to me, perhaps this is because MMO's are so very likely to focus on Solo players these days, leveling just doesn't hold any challenges anymore.

1367791636.0	1dr5xb	Asheron's Call's loot system: is there anything else like it?	KoboldCommando	18	1	18	"I don't play Asheron's Call anymore, but there are a ton of things I loved about it.  Probably more than anything else however was its random loot system. Spending hours, days, weeks looking for that one perfect piece, or just seeing what you could get to show up.  Swapping armor with your friends, showing it off, and just enjoying it.

Part of why I enjoyed it is that it's not strictly necessary in any way.  In fact there was quite a while where people more or less ignored it in favor of building mages and mage-hybrids and just buffing robes as armor and using quest weapons.  But it's still there, and it's still fantastic.

I started to go into detail about it, but there's just so much that goes into it!  For an armor drop, you see a huge amount of variance in the type of armor, the areas of your body it covers (9 slots for armor, two clothing, 5 pieces of jewelry...), the color (sometimes three separate colors, with tons of hues), the armor level, the elemental resistances, and of course the buffs.  There are also a massive number of buffs in the game, meaning building a suit to cover them all was a monumental task, but it remained quite fun because it was always easy to make compromises, using quest items, accepting buffs a level or two lower than max, what have you.

They even made the system even crazier later on with tinkering, letting you move buffs between items, boost certain stats, and add certain buffs and abilities you couldn't get otherwise.

Like I said, I don't play AC anymore, and I don't know if I want to go back at this point.  Is there anything else out there with a loot system even remotely resembling this level of depth? Even Diablo and its followers feel shallow by comparison, and most MMOs prefer to follow the ""quest item of the week"" approach to gear which just bores me to tears.

Anarchy Online comes fairly close, it's even more in depth mechanically I think, but it relies a lot more on crafting and questing with less spontaneity, and the game shifts into ""raid gear"" mode as you level up, unfortunately."	t5_2qlxw	True

I like to play alot of PvE content, for example well made Questlines/Stories, Dungeons/Raids, Events etc.

I've spent the last few years making prototypes and small burner projects to understand the concept of network programming. About a year ago I felt I was comfortable enough to build an entire experience out of it and started on what is now the Noble's Land project.

At this point it's a seven program project

* Game Client
* Game Server
* Resource Editor
* World Editor
* Publisher Tool
* Launcher
* Website

I've started doing videos recently to get the hang of it while it's still early along, [you can check out a Release Video of the last test session, this past weekend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfXCnLMq_NU). [There is also the Video Update series where I try and demonstrate the latest features I've been working on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gBCbnqtdUA&amp;list=PLPribIMoX_d8HDD_NOmQnwrJgm4vKx8TC).

As for the game design I am taking what I loved about older games from my childhood and applying newer technology and design behind it. 

* Backpacks are free placing, not slotted
* No hotbars, no 1-0 combat
* Always on PVP
* When a player is killed in pvp they drop their current backpack and one piece of equipped gear, they have X minutes to try and get it back either by themselves or by calling in nearby guild mates
* No paperdolling (NO RAINDOW ARMYS). When you make your character you pick your starting class. You have an idle style based on your current class. When you wear a full matching set you become a subclass which will change your appearance to others. For example, if you are a Warrior and wear let's say a full gold set of armor you would become a Golden Warrior which would give you unique abilities as well as change your appearance. If you die and drop a piece of gear you will get a buff that lets you keep your subclass until the item is looted or dropped on the ground.

* Instead of hundreds of generic items I plan on having one set of armor per class per skill range. This way when you see someone appear on your screen you know what they can do or what they have attached. So lets say lvl 1-10 is rank 1 set, lvl 11-20 is rank 2, lvl 21-30 is rank 3. If you had a mixed set of gear from rank 1, rank 2, and rank 3 you would be the rank 1 subclass. If you had a mixed set of rank 2 and rank 3 gear, you would be rank 2 subclass. I hope that makes sense. You can get a sense of their strength at first glance, but they could have mixed armor so you can't always be sure. You can ctrl + click the player and it will open a Player Identify window which will show you what pieces they have on. The idea is that players will look at each item in the game like symbols instead of generic number raising junk you swop out every half hour.
* No Auction Houses
* No Player Levels but Skill Levels
* Land Rental: You can't place houses anywhere in the wild. You can rent houses in cities. There are also a handful of lots in secluded places around the world where you can build your own buildings. This way the thought and design I put into the map wont be ruined by random houses all over the place.
* Land mounts and boats
* Law system: bad actions like killing others unprovoked, stealing from stores, etc... will give you criminal ratings. Lawful characters display names become green, those who commit crimes become red. You can potentially be sent to jail (sort of a punishment, but there is also content there you can enjoy but still in isolation).
* Unique lore and design aka non-Tolkien based. No Orcs, Goblins, and Elves. It's more a story of survival and exploring the unknown. Long story short ""your the human race on a new planet trying to survive. The settlers aren't cherry picked but are a random assortment of people so what it would be like if a random assortment of people around the world had to establish society and government without any knowledge of how everything actually works"" That's a shitty summary of it but I really have gone on long enough. It's a good amount of humor involved.

So yea, that's enough description for now. If I have piqued your interest at this point and you want to know more you can do the typical internet things to see how it progresses. You can subscribe to me on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, RSS.... I have a subreddit if that's your thing too. There is also a Developer Blog on the homepage. I try and spread it around enough so you can get news whichever way you prefer. You can get links to everything on the menu bar on [NoblesLand.com](http://NoblesLand.com)

If anyone has any feedback, questions, or comments I would love to hear them. I promise I wont self promote around here for a long time. You would obviously be my target audience but I also know how annoying it can be. Thanks for your time!

F2P business model and pricing structure has seen significant success in other games: Especial egs such as Team Fortress 2 and
League Of Legends: Both Commercial and Player satisfaction. Why is this?

More than a few indications suggest that F2P is growing and already is the dominant revenue model in MMORPGs; a quick search reveals some strong claims to this view:

1. [Turbine: F2P “The Only Sustainable” MMO Model](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/05/17/turbine-f2p-the-only-sustainable-mmo-model) 

&gt;""Turbine launched the Lord of the Rings Online in 2007 as a pay-to-play title, before abandoning subscriptions in 2010. Since then, the revenue from the title has doubled, and a similar transition has taken place for Dungeons and Dragons Online.""

2. [Wargaming.net: F2P Is The Future for ALL Gaming](http://www.gamefront.com/e3-2012-wargaming-net-f2p-is-the-future-for-all-gaming/)

&gt;""“Absolutely, and for any kind of gaming. Google is free, Facebook is free, even your cell phone, barring some minor down payments, is free, so yes — it’s the future for all kinds of gaming. The box — retail — will not survive. Downloads for money will not survive. Because of piracy, because there’s so much… Quality. If you look at games coming out of China, you see multi-million dollar budget games that are improved upon every month after launch, and they’re free.

&gt;“So yes, free to play is the future, and we proudly consider our company to be one of the pioneers in free to play, quality games. In the past two years, the market of global online games has grown like crazy, and we’re part of this growth.”

And with notable recent F2P converts include: The Secret World, Star Wars: The Old Republic and Tera, it seems F2P is the future of mmorpgs. Or is it?

**Arbitrary Best F2P MMO List**

A quick and dirty search for the quality of F2P titles (also includes ""reformed P2P"" mmorpgs) does not necessarily reveal that F2P makes a game any better than a P2P and it's open to question if F2P ends up being cheaper also. Additionally there are volumes of F2P mmorpgs that give F2P a very bad name.

[Best Free MMORPGs - gamesradar](http://www.gamesradar.com/best-free-mmorpg/)

2. DC Universe Online

To answer some of these questions I've added some very insightful and comprehensive articles on F2P in mmorpgs and games in general:

1) Is F2P the future?
2) How does F2P affect the design of mmorpgs?
3) Will F2P lead to spending less or more by players?
4) Is there still a future for sub-based mmorpgs?
5) How does F2P relate to virtual or simulated game economies?

... and many more questions:

Wildstar simply put just feels like WoW's successor. The devs are promoting this game saying it's made for hardcore players. That appeals to me see as how most mmo content feels rather rinse and repeat. This is possible because of they way they are doing combat. High mobility and those markers on the ground. Much more activity.

FFXIV:ARR seems to be more of a hobby game. I'm in love with the ability to change classes on one character and that the professions are classes themselves. It would be pretty cool to just be a expert miner or tailor. "	t5_2qlxw	True

Anyways, below is the class updates.  Big update with lots to read!  There will be 2 main designations; Maestros (Caster/Range) and Champions (Melee/Tank/DPS).

My question is: how can you get away from that formula and still have quests? And could an MMO survive without any formal quests? Do we just need a fresh take on the old formula?

I'd love to discuss ideas, as I am having trouble coming up with any myself that would keep MMO's social and not entirely soloable."	t5_2qlxw	True

Games that are coming out soon (Hopefully) that have caught my interest are:

**FFXIV: A Realm Reborn**

**Camelot Unchained**

**Wildstar**

**Dragon's Prophet**

**Blade &amp; Soul** (Idk what stage this is in for NA)

**Phantasy star online 2** (Same as Blade &amp; Soul, though you can play the JP version with an English patch pretty easily).

**Archeage**

**TES: Online**

**Black Desert** (though that's quite a ways out)

**Everquest Next** (probably a couple years out)

I'll use TERA as an example, since it has open world PvP, as well as PvE servers. Why not have some open world (Lineage 2 style) raid bosses, where on PvE servers, the bosses simply put you in an instance, and you can kill them once per day or something. But on PvP servers, you have to PvP other guilds or parties for these bosses. Anyone who has played a game where you had to PvP over raid bosses knows it's one of the most fun things you can do in a game.

I've played most of the early MMO stuff like EQ, WoW, GW, etc. I'm kinda outta the loop with the newer stuff, though I have tried GW2, a bit of SWTOR, and miscellaneous asian mmos too. With that said, I'm trying to see what the WORLD wants to see in an MMO:

* what your favorite parts are 
* what your gameplay would be like
* what fun mechanics would you introduce


For myself:

Not so much gameplay wise, but a beautifully designed HUD gets me into a game. If it's seamless and uniquely presented, the better.  

Aside from that, I love games that don't take themselves so seriously. So if I get bonus xp for popping off a boss' head clean off with a rolling pin, I'll love that game. 

So yeah, if you can help, that would be faaaantabulous.

**TL;DR** - I'm a writer and want to know what specific things you'd like to see in an MMO or what you love about existing ones.



**EDIT:**You guys point out some great gameplay elements and they're all kind of meshing together. Now my next question I guess is, where do you see the future of MMOs heading? What kind of new gameplay mechanics would you include? What if the level of immersion was increased with headgear and tactile feedback peripherals? "	t5_2qlxw	True

I’ve been one of those players fortunate enough to see the evolution of these games from the get go. I’m not talking about WoW being someone’s first MMO, and certainly not TERA or GW2. These games have been around a long time. From the early days of Origin Systems and Lord British to the birth of the modern MMO like UO and the original Everquest. I feel like so many of these PC titles are becoming more and more like console games. At the very least, a fragment of what they once were.

Content and levels are faster becoming increasing easier to acquire. Gear less important and certainly less unique.  I can’t remember the last time I was standing next to a player (in any game) and envied his/her appearance knowing exactly what an item was he/she was wearing solely by their appearance.  No inspection necessary. Most appearance items of today are bought from a market and hardly resemble the item being worn. 

I remember the days of Epics and how unique each and every weapon and armor set was. I remember the Coldain War where hundreds of players (most complete strangers) united together to assist in a zonewide PVE event for a single item!   An event with hundreds of NPCs and complex storylines.  I remember Dragons Wandering the land challenging players of all levels to keep a watchful eye on the horizon where any zone could be dangerous regardless of level. Even mobs were unique, some rare some ultra rare with hundreds of varieties. 

I remember when there was no market place and you had to earn “run speed”. I remember when experience potions were a rare reward (like a 5 years Veteran reward) instead of $5 in the marketplace.

Worlds have become easier to navigate, death meaningless (What’s a Rez anyway?).  Groups are becoming smaller, classes more independent, raids irrelevant.  You can even buy in game currency directly from the game developers!! 

Once familiar terms like Quad Kiting or Swarm Kiting are near dead. Rare spawns and “rare drops” less and less meaningful with each new release as game developers work harder and harder to appeal to the masses. 

While I’m a HUGE fan of graphics and game improvement, and open minded to new combat systems, there’s something to be said and missed about the old ways.  Some things should not only be remembered but built from. 
In a recent (but brief) conversation I had with Brad McQuaid we expressed similar interests, and unfortunately similar concerns that MMO titles today are about the masses, and that the days of the true Hard Core…may be over.

While I’m no doubt expecting the vast majority of players reading this to shrug in disbelief, troll this post and talk about how great games have become, here’s to hoping there’s a few remaining veterans out there still hoping, waiting for the return of the MMO.

Im currently play SWTOR but ready to give it up due to a really really really boring PvP system

I dont understand why there is not more interest in MMO's that have open world pvp, and preferably, non-tab targeting and loot systems set up. What if a game instituted features like this where the grind was minimal and top of the line gear was, for the most part, easy to obtain. Do you think there would be more interest?

We played oldschool everquest at the launch of Kunark. Back then you would find a camp, stand there with a group and destroy monsters for hours on end untill you leveled. There were no question marks on peoples heads and quests were generally for the item not the experience. True experience came from claiming a camp and being as efficient as possible.

While there's plenty of valid reasons for people to dislike the very nature of those games, I actually tend to enjoy it. I *do,* however, have a very specific complaint with those games in particular: the way the in-game economy works.

When I last played MS, the only way to sell items was either to open up a shop, which required spending real money; or to spam WTS messages in the designated zone. When I last played RO, it was similar: you had to either level up a dedicated merchant character, or else spam your WTS advertisements.

Are there any simple Grindy games of that nature that have an actually *decent* in-game economy? I don't mean that the prices are normalized, or that there aren't too many gold-sellers; I mean just mean a game where everybody has equal opportunity to sell their drops in a fair and balanced setting.

From playing various mmorpgs in recent years I have noticed a rather jarring trend. Generally the larger and more successful guilds and players will get to end level and start taking on the end game content. Now this content may start off imbalanced and difficult and will cause a few to complain. The developers will then proceed to drop the difficulty somewhat, feeling rather nervous about losing potential subs. This tends to start a domino effect and before you know it all gear and difficulty levels have been dropped several times over the course of the first few months.

These people eventually get bored of running the same content again as there is no challenge and since they are decked out in all the gear you could dream of they have no incentive and leave.

Now ""back in the day"" of vanilla/tbc wow, the end content was difficult (looking back, too difficult at the start), there were plenty of casual players and the numbers ever increased. Now, many players weren't able to meet the demands of the higher guilds at the time, but the numbers still rose.

Is it because there just wasn't much choice back then and wow came at the right time or will casuals still play even if there is content they just can't access unless they put more time in?

More importantly, do you think having the old school difficulties and principles back will keep the overall player-base playing for longer?

This was pretty much my first MMORPG. I remember sitting in Draynor chopping on willows trying to get 99 woodcutting.

 That game kept me entertaining and playing the longest of any MMORPG game to date. Maybe this was just because I had real life friends playing or something I don't know. The game was just sort of simple but had tons to do and somehow chopping trees all day didn't seem boring at all. The bots were probably the main reason I quit. Everyone was so rich it didn't seem like I could compete by playing normally. 

Is there any sort of game that will emulate this feeling that is newer and better perhaps? It doesn't have to have terrible graphics it just needs to be somewhat similar. I bought GW2 and it really didn't do much for me. It seemed like a grind to me and the community was friendly enough, but it wasn't about just grinding and chatting. Yes Runescape had more grind but it didn't feel like they were trying to hide it or something. I thought all the quests in RuneScape were actually sort of unique and enjoyed them. Not to mention all of the skills. 

Anyways, I always get this sense of nostalgia thinking about that game. Maybe it is just because it was the first MMORPG I played. But nothing since has compared even though the games were definitely higher graphics, more developers, better quality overall. I am just not ever feeling happy with an MMORPG lately and want to bring that old feeling back.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions. Who knows maybe I should just start another Runescape account? Does anyone here play anymore? I know it sort of started to go downhill after the wilderness died and the GE and whatnot, but I know they have added a lot since then. Is it even worth playing anymore? Anyways, thanks in advance. Happy gaming.

I'm wondering if anyone knows anything about that Blizz project they are supposedly working on, I believe it's called project titan?

I ask because like many of you I'm sure I struggle to find an MMO that is worthy of my time , basically one that I enjoy and can get engrossed in.

I'm 20 years old and played world warcraft since I was 13 or so and have stopped playing it within the past 2 years. I say that because i never quit one day but I'm sure you know what I mean, I sort of stopped and started until I eventually lost interest; though I do occasionally think about trying it again.

A part of me asks myself whether I grew up and out of the genre (truly my best time in gaming, those years were just amazing)or whether the game grew stale and nothing has come close to it since. I tried GW2 and as fantastic as it is, it just isn't the same.

So tell me, /r/MMO, what's next in line to be the 'saviour' of the MMOs? Perhaps, for me at least, it needs to be blizzard."	t5_2qlxw	True

However, when I do find the few that has music that just makes me go ""yessss i love this"", it's awesome.


At the moment, my memory is failing me and I can't remember all of the games which had a lot (or even one) piece of music I loved, but one I do remember and love, is one of my first MMORPGs, Maplestory.

As far as I know, nearly all the music in this game is memorable and catchy. It's the kind of thing that I'd listen to, and remember, and typically not get sick of. There's the typical town themes, which are still enjoyable, to the fun little areas, to the really epic ones. 
For me, both the old music and the new music in the ever-updating game are both just as charming, and they are a blast to listen to and play the game to. They really manage to set the mood, and it's one of the few, if the only, MMORPG to really make me feel a sense of sadness, anxiety, or just really pump me up for that big battle. 

There's a lot I can say about it, but Maplestory definitely takes the cake for not only having the most songs I can remember and like in its soundtrack, but also just for having awesome songs in general. It's not just because of nostalgia, I just genuinely think Maplestory has some amazing music.



Here's a few of which I quite like. One of them I hadn't even heard before, hah!

Okay by a few I mean quite a bit. I had to stop myself, I could go on and on, there's just so many pieces I like. I highly recommend browsing some of Maplestory's ost.

So, yes, r/mmorpg, what's some of the best music you've heard from an MMORPG? I'm interested in seeing, since everyone has such different tastes, what music has caught your eye enough to really grab your attention and just make you go ""damn this is some good music."""	t5_2qlxw	True

Look no further: Tera Rising	Kuldebar	25	11	51	"So, I started playing Tera Online just under a month ago after watching this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gXIl2iZ7vn0). 

I had shied away from the game on its NA Release because of words like *""Korean grind-fest, strange combat system, weird art style, Elins""*. 

Also, I had only so much money for gaming and I had already spent it on Rift and later GW2; both decent games; but GW2 kind of let me3 down because it became (strangely enough in a dynamic game) stale. Rift, I left only because my fellow guild mates drifted away and I had little interest in forging new friendships in-game at that point of time.

There are plenty of reviews out there on Tera, when reading them, keep in mind these very relevant points by [bridgetjones](http://www.mmorpg.com/profile.cfm/username/bridgetjones):

&gt;I seriously think I would fall over dead if anybody writing at MMORPG ever actually got to cap in this game instead of taking screenshots of the starter zone and calling it a day.  A few points I'd add as a vet player:

&gt; 1)  The game's hard.  It starts out easy and gets progressively more difficult with a steep curve about halfway through leveling.  If you're not leveling a Berzerker, then you have to take care of your gear while leveling, enchant it some, and use good crystals.  You can die while leveling, which is something that's been removed from WoW and its clones.

&gt; 2)  The only people who think Isle of Dawn is breathtaking are people who have not seen the rest of the game.  Isle is mindblowing coming fresh from uglier games, but just wait til you get to the capital cities, Heartwood, Scythra Fae, Tirkai Forest, Fountain of Shara, Bastion and Baldur's Temple, etc.  If you can run it on max, there's very little that touches it.

&gt; 3)  The armor and weapon designs are all race, gender, and class specific.  If you have a human female, the design is completely different than on a high elf female.  You can also dye every piece of armor in the game using custom RBG/brightness sliders.  There are dozens of armor designs per race/gender/class, and every single one is usable to remodel gear while leveling.  So I disagree very much that everybody looks the same within a race/gender/armor type.  There will be overlap no matter what, but there's a lot of customization here, including re-usable costume and accessory slots. 

&gt; 4)  You haven't truly experienced Tera's combat until you've stepped into a hard mode.  Most of the bosses have relatively simple mechanics that are, in practice, very difficult to execute.  There is no Deadly Boss Mod telling you the attack timers; you have to outsmart and outplay the AI of a very large, fast monster that wants you to die.  There's no global CD to stare at, there's no skill in the game that's spammable, and there's no set rotation.  You use skills based on priority, situation, and cooldowns.  The starter zone only gives a tiny, tiny taste of what the actual endgame is like.

The game is beautiful, [sexy](http://www.otakustudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/swimsuit_hero.jpg); and the combat..*.if you can adapt to a new way of MMO combat*, the combat system is very engaging. More so than GW2's rather static combat skill system, each character class will gain a large number of skills and abilities while leveling in addition to custom Glyph builds to further use for specialization.

It's free, come try it, you might just like it. But give it a chance, don't be thrown off because it isn't like every other MMO out there. Oh, it's a theme-park ride, for sure, but with some really nice differences. Fact: No one complains about lack of content in Tera, too much content maybe, but not a ""lack there of"".

I have played this on and off since the start and currently almost maxed up in LFR epics, which leaves me (as a now causal player) no place to go.

So, I have thought about leveling up a new char, as various trips around the world on my main (and only) bring back huge nostalgia trips.

However, what are the worlds like on the other mmos, are they are intresting/epic as wow's world [which IMHO] is excellent, so much to see and do/find.

I started playing TERA today, and when I landed in the starting area, I accepted the first quest, did the second and found some non-agressive mobs. ""Hey I'll get a couple of levels off of these guys"" I told myself.

Well I did and then I realized, how I missed killing mobs to level. I didn't want story driven elements in my MMO. I think that's why I hated Rift so much. I wanted an open world game where I could level without the need of quests, and without the need of instancing - I wanted to adventure with other players.

See, MMOs to me are a grand adventure game, where you make friends as you travel. It's not one instance to another instance to another instance ad infinitum.

1372095667.0	1gzbeq	Anything new worth trying?	King_and_Bird	16	4	41	"My friend and I have been desperate to find a new game.

We play Dragon Nest together but until there are new updates there's really nothing for us to do, so recently we've been on a quest to find new games.

Neither of us wants to play another point and click game. So that really doesn't leave us that many options.

I already have GW2 but he's not interested so it's not an option. We've both tried Vindictus and we're not big fans of it.

I would appreciate recomendations of games with a decent player base, not really interested on playing in a deserted place. PvP is a big + as well.

PS: We're from Europe.

EDIT: Here's a small list of what we've already tried, currently waiting for and planning on trying.

Some of the games we play(ed) (and at least one of us enjoyed):

Dragon Nest

S4 League

Guild Wars 2 (but he's not interested in spending money right now)

Grand Chase (just me)

C9 (Just me)

Games we're currently waiting for:

Phantasy Star Online 2

HeroesGo

Onigiri

Games we're considering trying but not too sure:

Tera

Elsword

RaiderZ

EDIT2: Thanks everyone for the recommendations, I'll be trying out Tera as soon as I can, I'll also look into some of the other games you guys recommended, I won't be trying FFXIV though, I'm ok with ""Buy2Play"", P2P on the other hand..."	t5_2qlxw	True
1371558807.0	1gkws4	Fantasy MMO with most rewarding crafting	mexamoxa	13	0	38	In your opinion, what's the MMO with the best / most rewarding crafting system? I'm looking for a game where crafting is important, where I can create really good items for my char and others, on par with end game drops (?)...? I played vanguard at launch but left due to all the obvious issues it had but the crafting system seemed really good. I played LotRO for some 18 months too and I enjoyed the vocation system and interdependance. Do you people advise any of these two or another game? Cheers!	t5_2qlxw	True

1370473889.0	1fr5ty	Some elements I would like to see in future MMOs	mahlzeitcompany	23	9	25	"I was looking for some decent MMOS to play, I enjoyed WoW very much, BC was great, WotLK was okay, after that it just went down for me. I tried out Rift, which many people find a decent descendant of Vanilla WoW. It's a good game but I'm having some troubles with it, it just doesn't feel sharp.

This is my personal opinion, feel free to discuss. It's not necessary relevant to Rift, but to all MMOs. My Vanilla WoW heart is speaking here, please feel with me.


* Decent Talent trees

My favourite talent trees were in Vanilla WoW. You got one point each level, you felt a little bit more powerful each level up. You slowly learn to adapt to new abilities and enjoy your character. And what happened? They changed it to one point every 15 levels. Totally takes my inducement to level up.

* Classes need to have clear differences

Rift for example. Only 4 classes? Okay. What? Every class is like 4 classes, hundreds of options, getting overwhelmed by the massive amount of abilities, souls. So I spend 5 points in a tree, giving me passively 1% damage increase per point, I can skill new abilities and effects. BUT ALSO I get abilities and effects based on the amount of points i spend on the tree passively. This just blows my head. I can play rogue as melee, as ranged, as spell ranged, as damage heal support, as tank. This is too much. You should be able to do two roles, not all of them. 


* No automatic teleport INTO the dungeons. 

I would like to see where the hell I am. What's wrong with two people going to the place and teleport me in front of the door, and we go in together.

* Limited amount of currencies. 

I don't want millions of coins, marks, emblems, sigils or whatever to buy some gear during leveling. I'm learing to play the game and now you want me to figure out where I can get what gear at which price for which level. Keep it to a human amount so that everbody understands what it's for, so people with less time can also get some good gear. But keep it until max level, please.

* Subscription. 

Make it 2, 3, 5 Bucks per month and I stick to it. This won't let me unsubcribe if I feel I'm not going to play that much. Give the first week for free. Advantage to F2P: People who enjoy the game will stay and build a stronger community. No need to sell pay2win items, no need to pay for getting advantages.

* Limited instant teleports to certain places. 

If I want to get from A to B, I want to see what is between. The griffin concept is just fine.

* Two dungeon modes

One easy AoE-through mode for leveling, one hard ""I have to use my brain and CC some mobs, walk outside the fire"" mode for max-level.


* One Bag Window. Why do I need to click on 4 different bags?

* Adequate transition between main game and addons. Having 200000 hitpoints is just absurd.

* Crafting needs to have personal benefits.

* Level description for zones/territories.



Feel free to add.

I've put 90 hours into the game now and am having an absolute blast. The missions are like none in any other game I've played, I especially love the investigation missions.

The dungeons are very fun, although the boss mechanics are very WoW-ish, there are still plenty to do, nightmare modes, elite modes and then a raid.

I'm a PvPer by heart, but I love open world PvP so I haven't even touched PvP this time around in TSW, yet (being the operative word). From what I remember the PvP wasn't that great, but the rest of the game has been great so far.

1354066329.0	13wox5	"""Sandbox MMO"", Anyone Else Tired?!"	stealthmoe	17	5	37	"/rant

We were playing ""Sandbox"" MMOs before it became the buzzword it is today. I started playing this genre with Everquest: Online Adventures. Yes, it's not Ultima Online, but I can still say I was ""on the scene before WoW"" so that gives me a little more credibility.

Does anyone else sit back while playing the ""MMO of the Month"" (last month was Guild Wars 2) and think, ""Man, this game has awesome graphics, but it's still the same as &lt;GAME&gt;."" The industry changed when WoW released. Packaged content, released at regular intervals, with tiered progression ensured the ""majority"" of players will stay hooked forever and was so successful. Thus, the ""themepark"" was created. Developers jumped from being innovative to trying to recreate the magic. 

The simple fact the phrase ""WoW-Clone"" is a pejorative shows the industry again is in flux. Themeparks bad, sandbox good. My two favorite MMOs of all time are Star Wars Galaxies and Shadowbane. These were sandboxes before it was hip. If SWG or Shadowbane were released tomorrow, they would the sandboxes everyone thinks they want until the masses realize communities sometimes suck and make it their mission to ruin your gaming experience.  

I hope one of these crowdfunded games become a hit and we can return to golden age of MMOs, spending hours and hours corpse camping each other or laying siege to your wonderful player-made city you spent everything on and see it wiped out right before your eyes.

* Larger maps with more details. I thought of a HD Skyrim looking world with large maps/dungeons. With the larger maps however i feel some would want a way to quickly travels still so maybe a vehicle or TP Ports?
* No level system but a skill system. Possibly with trainers and practice? This would encourage more play time to work on your skills in the game and could help with the better combat system. 
*Sandbox! The only problem that I would see encountering is people who would try to loot banks and other people more then just to play the game. I do want items to have some kind of security for the inventory, but I also enjoy the possibility to rob someone blind.
* Crafting mini-games and less drops. It would encourage a strong economy and player enjoyment. It would take out a large part of wanting to fight bosses however, but with the skill system mentioned above it just might be what is needed.
* Clans are what your character is born into, while guilds will be limited. I can understand the wanting to limit the guilds, but I just don't see the possibility of that happening, EVER.
* More Mods? It would be costly... Has there ever been an in game report button? I am fairly new to MMORPG's and I haven't seen anything like and in game report button. Also if that is abused, what about a volunteer group of people who have a more direct access to a mod to address the problems.
* More Character customization / Import a photo and the game will try create a digital character like that?
* Combat can come from anywhere at anytime. So you can fight and kill anyone at anytime, with a duel system to ensure that if you want to test your skills and not die you can. 
* Many random Unique items that travel around. So maybe a pet that follows you around for a while, or a weapon that talks while you fight, or some other just random cool things that you can show off to others. Some would be be able to be held on to(as long as you are active) and others would just travel.
* Servers. I saved this for last because I have an idea. When you first start out in the game you create a character. After all the face and body details you put in you choose what clan you want to be apart of. Each clan would have its own server/ starting area. After the getting to know the game phase, where you are judged on your skill and ability to handle the game and placed in a server appropriated to your skill level, however if you feel you have been placed wrong you can choose to move up not down. With that there are also different servers for different towns and dungeons and plains. I think if we are able to break up the areas into different servers it would allow for larger maps and less people per server. And along with that have a few servers for the more frequently stopped at places like towns, and add a chat that travels though all of them. I think this would be EXTREMELY costly however. 


ORIGINAL : Sorry about the read but what do you think are some good aspects of one and ideas to improve on some of the ones I have?

* Good combat system
* I want a market system that can be controlled by players or guilds. If you want what the NPC does like as a black smith or something you can buy out his company and do what you wish with it. You can keep it as a black smiths or change it to a home, a guild space, a store, a storage space, ANYTHING. But it can also be bought out from you, broken into, destroyed. 
* Lots of NPC's and social aspects 
* Mix of Past, Present, Future 
* Not Pay to win but you can buy items and clothes that have no extra stats and available for free in game money
* True open world. I want no area that goes ""you can not pass though this area."" If there is a door you can break it down. If there is a mountain you can try to scale it. If there is a wall you can try to break it. If it has ledges you can try to grab them. 
* Clans and guilds.  I want guilds and clans. I want to be able to create new towns and destroy others.  I want to build a world that begins in order and based on the decisions of the people playing the game... it may become anarchy.
* I want you to be able to make one Character and only this one. If you die you are moved to another world (these will be like servers) and cannot return to a previous one (well maybe). And the skill tree you choose can be changed or expanded into any of the others.
* I want no limitations based on your skill levels. If you try and fail, you may lose some experience or some stats, but along with that i don't want it based on luck either. I don't want a level system that goes off the time played or the time farming. The only available at this time events are also a problem.
* A crafting system that is easy to understand and work with
* A strong story line that encourages PVP and PVE interactions, but you may find your way on your own. 
* Good graphics and environmental settings

I love playing with people on games like CoD and Smite. I love walking around in skyrim where the world seems to go on for ever. I research a little bit and the most common names that came up were Rune Scape, Aion, Wow, and Guild wars 2. Now before I go on and put 20 hours on a game trying to get into it, Which one is the  best? I don't mind spending a little bit of money 10-15 dollars a month but 40-60 dollars to start might be a problem (Wow, Guild wars 2) I want to be able to walk for hours in a straight line and not reach an end, I will like to play with people who are respectful and don't mind hanging out and chat for a while, Pvp  is not a must but I wouldn't mind, I own FF14 but sadly It just wasn't for me the narrow world paths didnt cut it for me, I want a truly open world at least most of it. I try the free trial for WoW and it was fun but to continue playing its $60 and a monthly subscription. I dont want to pay that and then find out that Guild Wars 2 would have been a better choice. I played DC universe and even thou I love the fighting and setup there is very little exploring to be done I can wait s couples weeks for my Bday and get WoW or GW2 if you guys believe that would be the best way to go.

1346810247.0	zdc6a	The year of the MMORPG (2012) has let me down so far. I think I'm done	Saish	22	8	51	"The year isn't over, but I am pretty sure I'm now completely done with MMORPGs in general. I can't tell if it's my age (late 20s), being sick of the genre, or just a whole lot of crappy releases, but I have been completely underwhelmed with the releases so far this year. 

After years and years of waiting for some of these titles and being completely bored, I knew that 2012 was THE year for releases. 

**SWTOR**
Technically this came out in late 2011, but I'm counting it anyways. Played it hardcore for the first month and then realized the entire game was just WoW with lightsabers, crappy PvP, and a lot of loading screens (thank you Hero engine). Quit cold turkey after beating the end game raids on normal mode and haven't missed it one bit.

**Tera**
This was my hopes and dreams. Action combat with scantily clad females? Hell yes. I have no idea why, but I completely lost interest and stopped logging in. I even continued to pay for the sub a few months after I quit, in hopes that I'd want to someday login and play again. Never happened and I eventually stopped my subscription. 

**Diablo 3**
Not considered a MMORPG by most, but I picked it up this year in hopes that it'd make me become addicted. I got two chars to cap and about 150M worth of gear before I started to feel like this game was a second job. Any awesome drop would make me wonder ""Do I want $20 for this or 40M gold?"" And plus, I can only farm Act 2/3 so much before it gets old. I'm sure it'll play out similar to D2, where I login randomly throughout the years.

**Guild Wars 2**
Yeah, most people are going to disagree with me on this one. But I really don't have much interest in this game. Admittedly, I'm only level 25 but I don't have the drive to go hardcore for the level cap like I normally do with most MMORPG releases. I can definitely see what things Arena Net has done right (like no monthly fee) but I just can't do it. I've tried out WvW, SPVP, and I've done things like crafting, gathering, and map completion on the PVE side, but really, the game doesn't seem innovative at all and it's having a hard time holding my interest. I'm forcing myself to login at this point.

I didn't try it, but I know that The Secret World is also underwhelming and only has half the amount of subs as initially expected (200k). 

The only other release I might try this year is Firefall (if it even gets released this year?). MoP is definitely a no, seeing as how I'm very, very sick of WoW. I would love to throw my money at some company to provide me years of entertainment and I thought this would be the year that decides it. I was wrong, definitely wrong.

Would anyone be interested in a non-blue baby MMO where everyone is spoon fed? For the love of god when did questing turn into simply following the guys with the bobbles over their head? Where everything is lined up and mapped as if you were following directions on a highway.

Would anyone want a game that is open world everything. No instancing. If you own a plot of land then you own that land and you can sell it later to the highest bidder. 

Open world free for all PvP where you can be killed by anyone at any time (after, say, level 7).

No teleportation or flight system. Only boats by water way and mounts by land.

Where epic gear is epic because it's rare and not everyone can have it. 

Where GM's do world events and actually aid in the story line as a powerful NPC boss or god.


A game where its lasting appeal is the community of players and the alliances they have formed.

Welcome tothe firsteditionof the Warhammer40,000: EternalCrusade newsletter. I’m David Ghozland, Creative Directorontheproject.

First of all, I wanted to say that myself and the team here at Behaviour Interactive can’t thank you enough for your support. We knew there would be a big response to a new 40k MMO, but the passion and enthusiasm we’ve seen from the community has gone beyond our expectations.

We consider this to be YOUR game – the online 40k world that the fans have always wanted. To that end, we’ll be setting up a space where you can communicate with the devs and share your thoughts. Expect some news on this front very soon!

In the months to come, this newsletter will be a platform for expressing our specific intentions on this project and communicating the thought processes behind its development. For the inaugural edition, however, I’d like to say a bit more about the game itself.

A World At War

One of the first misconceptions we saw about the game based on the announcement was that because of the game’s genre, people thought that we were making a ""traditional"" MMORPG. If you looked out our ""required playing"" list for new team members*, you'd see that we're planning on making something quite different indeed. We believe that the MMORPG genre is one with vast possibilities –just look at EvE Online or Firefall to see how far it can stretch.

In Eternal Crusade, we’re presenting a war on a planetary scale, but what you want to do in the game world is really up to you - there's no traditional quest or leveling structure in the experience. When you drop down to the planet with your friends, you’ll have a great overview of the ongoing conflict due to both traditional UI elements and community channels. If you want to head to the front lines and fight where you’re needed most, you can drive over there and do so. Along the way you might meet players from the enemy faction skulking about, or maybe you’ll spot a tantalizing entrance to the world beneath the surface or a Tyranid infestation bursting out near one of your strongholds.

Or perhaps one of your squad-mates will get an idea to hit the enemy behind their lines at a particularly valuable strategic position. It’ll take some skill to get there unnoticed and you might be guaranteed to have the enemy’s attention once you’ve done the damage, but the game's not going to stop you!

Part of what makes this possible is that MMO technology has come far enough to allow for true skill &amp; precision-based gameplay and we’ve made a deliberate choice to make progression as horizontal as possible. A small amount of power gain is inevitable, but in a PvP-focused game it’s crucial that the vast majority of progression is about filling out your tactical possibilities and increasing specialization. Tabletop 40k has been a big inspiration in this regard, as you’ll see when we talk more about creating your character builds.

The other part is that we’re not creating a ""content-heavy"" world, but rather one driven by gameplay systems. There are unique spots to find, environmental lore bits and an ongoing narrative, but community efforts and Tyranid invasions drive the battle for the surface while the shapes and challenges of the underworld are generated procedurally. Our aim is to make an online world that never stops being able to surprise its players.

If this sounds good to you, stick around! We’ll keep talking about the details of the game design and other production updates right here, so if you know anyone else who might be interested in these topics, you can encourage them to register on the site.

Until next time, may the Emperor protect!

David Ghozland

1367670170.0	1dobas	I often quit games during the endgame stage, and here's why.	kagemitsu	24	12	35	"I felt like ranting a bit, and I wanted to know everyone's opinion on endgaming nowadays. The reason why I hate endgame can be summed up in one word: raiding. 

I enjoy games during the leveling phase, and I like running dungeons with small groups, but when you get to the endgame part is when games stop being fun to me. Raiding requires lots of organization with your guild, it's an huge time sink and, more often than not, you come out empty handed. It's an endless grind where there's always some better piece of gear to get, and when there isn't, you can be sure the next patch or expansion is going to void all your work so far, and you get to grind all over again.

Besides the time factor, there's this thing that every boss has his own strategy. I realize that it was probably meant to make fights more engaging, but they only make it more annoying to me. Stack, move, kite, avoid the goo on the ground, focus heal at certain points... I know not everything can be tank &amp; spank, but some games take it too much to the extreme. You can't just jump into a dungeon and do your thing nowadays: you've got to study the strategies beforehand on a wiki or what have you, otherwise you risk causing wipes. It gets better after a few runs of the same dungeons, but at least for starters, it represents a great barrier to entry.

Basically, I still haven't found a game that has a casual-friendly endgame, and kinda saddens me because there are many other aspects of a MMORPG I like. I want to play a MMORPG, but I'd just like an alternative to raiding.

Do you think we will see some other forms of endgame in the future?

I've pulled away from WoW and Tera and looking for something else.  I saw some previews of age of Wushu and before I start to get into a new game just wondering what your experiences have been.  

The biggest thing I'm looking for in an MMO is the action combat of Tera but less grind.  I don't mind a grind to max level, but I don't want to get caught up in a game again where it takes countless hours of RNG to progress.

So for Age of Wushu, what has been your experience?  What do you love?  What do you hate?  Is there a decent amount of content in the beta?  Are there instances or Raids?  What is the primary feature of Age of Wushu that will keep you playing? "	t5_2qlxw	True

For example, any MMORPG I know makes grinding monsters totally lame. You can basically watch TV and kill monsters simultaneously. Solo grinding is basically: Find a single monster, Attack with spell 1 then 2 then 3, repeat until dead. Groups are basically: Tank, Healer, DD.

What I'm looking for is some game, where monsters are not just grazing grass on pastures in stupid amounts but are much more rare and difficult to kill. Every monster could require some specific tactics.

Basically, I want a game where you need to get ready for every fight, not just bosses. Any ideas? 

**TL;DR:** Basically, I want a game where ALL monsters are 5-10 times more dangerous than in regular MMORPGs (Lineage, WOW, etc) but also 5-10 times more rare. Also drops would need to be 5-10 times better too, not just pointless junk that you collect in thouthands.

Then in retail UO nowadays it's mostly full of long time players, with a lot of elitest's. A lot of close community circles and it's just not welcoming to newcomers.

I'm aching for a new sandbox that plays just like or similarly to UO with the type of community that i've heard so much that the game had the first few years.

It is hard for a company to truly nail a pirate themed game (just because it is difficult to get the mood right). For example, when I play a **pirate** game, I want to feel like a **pirate**. Someone who sits at the top of the world and does whatever the hell they want, not another mindless person dressed in silly clothes and sails around everywhere.

I think MMOs with a pirate theme should take a page out of **Sid Meier's: Pirates!** It really captured the mood of a pirate game in my opinion. You could reap the spoils of your victims and choose what to take and what not to, and then choose what to do with said spoils. For example, I was able to raid the treasure fleet (yet another player decision) of it's spices. Instead of them instantly cashing in for gold, I sailed to the town with the best market prices. It's the little things that really make games like these, the fine details. Another example is dancing with the governors daughter to get some cool gear. Or sacking a city just because you don't like the fat governor. MMOs developers need to understand it's not just about quests and gold. 

That said, one game I have my eye on is [Kartuga](http://beta.kartuga.com/). They are still in beta right now, so I don't know what to expect but I can tell that they're putting an emphasis on PvP. It's good because we still have lots of time for the game to develop.

Besides, a lot of the time, as soon as you get geared out, the next release is around the corner, what you have costs less and you start again. 

I play a lot of games. DCUO, WoW, SWTOR, GW2, D3 and TERA. It's not just the gear grind that gets me, its what you have to do once you get the gear, you then have optimize, gem, enchant, mod, augment, exo your gear, which is terribly annoying. Add to that there's usually PVE vs PVP sets, and you've got an incredible time sink just to compete on the same level as people.

To set this straight, I never want to have the best gear, but I like to compete on a level playing field. I usually have a lot of alts in games as one of my favorite things besides playing in a persistent world is obtaining new abilities and looks. 

I was curious as to everyone elses takes on this? It was sorta crap for me during Cata in WoW, I got my 10 alts all geared up in DS gear, only to barely use any of it. During Mists I've tried just leaving them with 1 teir behind, but I under perform terribly and it still takes some work, again, pvp them PVE.

Was just curious for ideas to alleviate this?

1366401628.0	1cp1x2	GW2 Free Weekend, First Impressions	7h3C47	22	10	28	"So I just logged my first ever 4 hours on GW2 as there is a free trial weekend going on.  I am playing on a beefy gaming rig. The only other MMORPG I've ever played has been Lord of the Rings Online, which is said to be a traditional or WoW style of game.  The four hours have been split between a Sylvari ranger, and a Charr engineer.

Some Positives:
-Graphics.  They're not as nice as everyone has been making them out to be in my opinion.  However I'm going to guess that people have been making this claim based on the graphics of many other MMOs, and the one I play happens to already be pretty decent.  Regardless, it's great.

-Character creation. I'm really impressed.  Very thorough.  Makes me feel like my toon is actually unique.

-Environments.  They're pretty immersive.  I would have liked to see a little more open-worldness to them for the starter areas, but that's just a personal thing.

-Options.  Many races, many classes.


Some things that didn't initially impress me:

-UI  It's so polished to the point where, yeah, everything is intuitive, but it's not particularly speedy where I can get the info I need really quickly and keep doing my thing.  Kinda clunky, would prefer something light and simple.

-Voice acting. Meh.

-New player guidance.  I could have used a little more aid in terms of what I'm supposed to be doing at any given point in time.  This wasn't terrible, but it would have helped.


Overall the game seems great so far!  The other people running around in the newbie areas were friendly and helpful.  I definitely plan to pick up this game at some point in the future.

Dungeons that were not just there to be 3 quick boss fights, collect loot, and leave.  Even in WoW throughout the expansions dungeons and raids had become much more linear, and simplistic.  Now from what I've seen they are just this side activity to do that join from pressing the LFG button and you are teleported to a dungeon with no context.

Sadly I have not found a newer MMO that has anything close to what I want to think of as dungeons.  Are these longer more immersive dungeons something that is gone from the MMO market?  Should they make a return or is simplifying the PvE experience something MMO's need to do?"	t5_2qlxw	True

The ""hunger"" for getting better gear/epics/itemlevel and so on, I liked that I always had a goal to work towards. GW2 is great, but I think there is a lack of content. I've done all there is to do (except sPvP but I'm more a PvE guy), even made 2 legendaries. 

As I said, GW2 is great but I lack goals, I want progress!


Do you have any mmo to recommend? I've been looking at Blade and Soul for quite some time and I'm definitely gonna try that out, but there is no release date in Europe yet. Considering that I love GW2 and the combat system, is there any mmo you would recommend?

The Secret World MMO

Evil roleplayers doing mischief in The Secret World, London zone.

Today at approx 12:40 London time I was accosted by a roleplayer wearing a pumpkin head by the Ealdwic Station. She promptly traded me a Fancy Glass.

Thinking this was a spontaneous gift by a so-called roleplayer (I am on the Arcadia dimension), I told her to stay and promptly ran to the Bank to withdraw a Quetzal Bird. It would be a fun exchange of gifts and I had the opportunity to delight an unknowing roleplayer. Or so I thought.
We then shared a glass of the sparkly drink she gave me. ""Drink up my friend!"" she said.
But to my horror, I instantly died! The glass was poisoned with cyanide!

Sure there was still somewhat of a user base of the dedicate fans. However, with EQ:Next (more than likely) starting off with the same f2p model all other SOE MMOs follow, do you think this could be bad for EQ:Next launch?


I know some people won't touch a f2p game because they generally think of gold botters, spammers and people who don't take the game seriously so no real end game content is ran. Basically because they aren't paying money for it, they don't care. In my opinion, one of the reasons why Guild Wars 2 had such a large drop in player base was because there wasn't a month fee and when shit hit the fan, people just stopped playing.


Assuming EQ:N follows EQ 1/2 the game will have it all: open world bosses, some instances, player housing, deep crafting system, auction housing, guild housing, mounts, companions, etc, etc, etc. Basically more than some sub games offer today. "	t5_2qlxw	True

What I want now is a f2p model.

I like the idea of RaiderZ's open character development but it looks like a button mashing sting of kill quests.  Vanguard's exploration is appealing as are the class options, but from what I read it's hard to solo and the servers are bare.

To gain access to the closed beta and the download, you have to buy ""elite"" from their website which costs $10, and includes some perks at launch etc. Please note this will stop being sold within 24 hours, I am not sure of the exact timing.

But as a side note, I have set up a subreddit over at /r/AgeofWushu which I would like to get popular. Anybody who buys Elite also gets 5 keys to give away, which one of the subreddit subscribers is kindly offering his keys over there.

I will also have a few keys to give away on the subreddit, first come first served.

So I've played the fuck out of Vindictus, but it got boring at about lvl38, and it wasn't the type of MMORPG I was looking for in the first place. Then I tried to get into Runes of Magic but it's really generic, the gameplay is bland, and no one talks. 

I'd love to play games with 15$ monthly fees, but I'm on a tight budget and can't really afford it. Can anyone recommend me a good F2P, or very cheap P2P MMORPG with a nice active community? Not Runescape because I already play that :3"	t5_2qlxw	True

1375730311.0	1jrboz	The Trinity isn't part of the game - it IS the game.	gtramontelli	29	18	43	"My MMORPG buddies and I have been having an ongoing discussion about the evolution of the MMO (featuring alternating bouts of nerd rage and nerd angst).  We've played many of the big ones over time and it seems like the latest few released have had a very ""flavor of the month"" feel to them.  There is also a trend toward eliminating the ""holy trinity,"" which seems appealing at first glance but is terrible in practice.

Guild Wars 2 is a fantastic game.  Their pricing model, leveling, exploration, and crafting are really well executed.  However, the group/dungeon mechanic is awful.  By eliminating the typical class roles, the dungeons feel more like a co-op single player affair rather than an MMO.  This alone ruined the game for me and my friends.  In  fact, the people I know who enjoy dungeons in GW2 only enjoy them because they've figured out some way to mimic the Trinity (""If you play guardian right you can pretty much tank"" etc).

I've come to the conclusion that the trinity isn't part of the game - it IS the game.  When we play MMORPGs, we are playing the trinity with a variety of skins and bells/whistles.  In much the same way that an FPS is expected to have the first-person perspective but may be set in WW2, the present day, or the future, the MMORPG may look and act any number of ways.  However, to eliminate the Trinity is to change the nature of the game.

Having to specialize and depend on group members is what creates the MMO experience.  It also creates the community.  If you're a dps, it pays to make friends with tanks/healers so that you can tackle content more quickly.  This effect is diminished somewhat by ""dungeon finders"" in the latest crop of MMOs, but I think most DPS would prefer to have a pocket healer/tank than to face the long wait times of LFG queues.  

My ideas about this are not fully formed, but I was wondering what other people think about this.  The reveal from Everquest Next is the main thing that got us on this topic.  I'm going to try the game (there are lots of really cool ideas in it) but I'm a little doubtful that the trinity can be eliminated without making it into a new type of game.

On the flip side. What old standards do you think are being phased out? I *thought* the trinity was on its way out, but gw2 group play was chaotic - so I'm not sure. I feel like pigeonholing a toon to one role is definitely on its way out though.

1369358798.0	1exyxj	What if players could create the side quests for MMORPGs, do you think would this make the game more interesting/entertaining? Do you think this could work?	Smiley-Face	13	3	21	"Ive been thinking of a interesting idea to go with the whole sandbox idea and keeping players interested in MMORPG games. As you know with alot of MMORPGs the side quests tend to be something along the lines of go here and kill X amount of creatures or obtain X amount of resources from creatures. 

How much more entertaining and rewarding would it be if the players where the ones creating the side quests, say a higher leveled player needs a certain resource to craft an item but this resource is obtained from lower leveled creatures. Instead of wasting their time grinding the resource themselves they could, they could post it as a quest for lower leveled players. 
The reward could be of their choosing. I have not quite thought out how exactly to work this, something along the lines of their own money maybe even experience, or an item even. 
This would give the possibility of endless amounts of side quests as it could range from bounties on peoples heads (if say you had a law system in the game) to simply protection for travel or even possibly clearing out basements or courtyards of creatures of a higher leveled players house/refuge etc.
If you could somehow make this system work that lower leveled players could 'hire' higher leveled players with a worthwhile reward for the higher leveled players then everyone would win.
Of course there would also be other npc quests such as main quests, specific quests or even other side quests.
I believe this would create more incentive to complete these side quests as you would be doing favors for other players and possibly even creating relationships, say maybe a favorite customer, or specific assassin/thief you want to get the job done. There could be reputations grown. This would also create alot of competition to get the job done first competing with other bounty hunters etc.

Would like to hear thoughts and feedback on this idea even the bad. Though this is just an idea im putting out there not even sure how it would work exactly."	t5_2qlxw	True

The first MMO I actually did this with was GW2, and I was swept up by Anet's flowery revolution speech. They made lots of vague promises that then fell flat (despite what you think about the game, there is a lot they said would be in it that hasn't manifested yet).

Then this new crop of Kickstarter MMOs springs up and devs are promising us things like ""The best PvP"" ""The biggest sandbox!"" etc. What do you guys think about this? Is this simply necessary to get funding for your game? Should they be held accountable to everything they promise now, in the stages of game development where it's 99% theoretical? 

And for devs with AAA budgets behind them, where's the line between pandering and simple honesty? Is it better to keep things vague so the community doesn't get its hopes up then rage when something doesn't play out? Or is it better to say something is in, find out its impossible to implement, and admit your mistake/apologize?

The LFG Dungeon Finder destroyed most of WoW's charm for me because after it, groups in WoW seemed silent too much of the time. Low incentive to socialize, and it seems almost like I HAVE to join a guild to get to know people.

I tried Guildwars 2, and while it did not have a dungeon finder, it seems very much built to remove incentive to socialize (e.g. with full xp to non-group-members on a kill, people around me rarely spoke during quests; I got caught in doing quests at full speed too).

I tried Eve Online. While it seems to have a great focus on community, it seems once again that I have to join a guild/corp to meet people. Bumping into them while questing/grouping didn't appear common.

I've never played Minecraft, but have heard it has MMO servers. Since it's not too expensive (and as long as it's a one-time purchase), I might be willing to get MC, if it offers what I want.

So, what F2P MMORPGs/MC servers fit the following criteria?

- Has no Dungeon-Finder.
- Has people socializing with randoms while questing/grouping (i.e. the MMO should let me make friends easily even without joining a guild).
- Is not too heavily affected by latency (I will almost certainly have ~200 latency on Eu servers, and maybe 350-450 on NA; for reference, I played WoW fine, even with ~700ms latency).
- Has plenty of PvE content. I'm not a fan of PvP."	t5_2qlxw	True

I enjoyed the character creation, the races, the classes, the storyline, the style of gameplay (including combat, the way the skill system worked, and the feats or trees seemed very interesting.)

As I played for about seven levels I noticed something. It was a linear path through a lot of instanced areas. While it was kind of nice to be in my own area I truly enjoy open world games. I wrapped up for the night.
Later I decided to check out some streams of the higher levels and see what it was like. It was more of the same and I asked a couple of the streamers if the game was as linear as it seems and they said yes.

From what I have seen, you could literally follow the sparkly trail from the beginning of the game to the end and never diverge from that path. I decided the game was just not for me as I enjoy open worlds with choices in where I will go what I will do and how I will level.

I had high hopes for the game and even an initial feeling of enjoyment but I just don't think it will be for me. But if you are looking for a theme park game with a neat combat system and instanced areas this could be the game for you.

I list of all the popular MMOs that shows the important aspects of the games (cost, PvP?, combat system, etc.)	Greyletter	14	4	7	"There are lists of MMOs out there, but they are usually really basic and don't give me the info I want when looking at MMOs. I don't care who the publisher is or how much hype the game has. I care about two things:

1. Is there a harsh death penalty?

2. Is there open PvP?

3. Is the combat like WoW? (if it is, I won't play)

4. Cost.

There needs to be a community driven site where this information about all current MMOs can be compiled, along with other information that other people care about. 

I hate having to search long and hard to find out what happens when I die in a game. I wish I could just find a list and filter by the things I listed above. I'm sure you all share my pain in some way.

1361095301.0	18oqfm	Looking for a certain kind of f2p MMO. Can you help?	Marzz	11	0	58	"Basically, I'm looking for a free-to-play MMO that's got a decent community, an engaging story, a cash shop that doesn't break the game, great early-game, and has extremely low system requirements.

I realize that the above is a complete and total pipe-dream.

But I do need a decent, free-to-play MMO with low system requirements. I played War of the Immortals for a long time but realized that i wasn't even progressing, i was just grinding the same events daily for experience and gold. 

My laptop WILL play WoW at lowest settings, and WILL play Rift on low render quality. I've got a Core 2 Solo, 2 gigs of RAM, and a weak intel video chipset. I've played Guild Wars 1 and enjoyed it, but I don't have much fun with that now. 

I'm not a big fan of kung-fu MMOs. I've tried them, but don't like them.

I was looking at Runes of Magic, but while my computer meets the system requirements for the game, I can't complete the registration process for some reason- pressing submit just brings me back to the registration screen. 

Being that I'm playing on a slow laptop, hotkey MMOs are best- no real-time combat like MapleStory or Dragon Nest. 

Anyways, I know the things I'm asking for are kind of rough. But what would you guys suggest?


**EDIT**

Turns out, Lord of the Rings Online has seriously low system requirements. Like, I don't know HOW they got the system requirements so low and managed to keep it looking so good. I'm about to play on the Gladden server (unless you guys have other suggestions), so feel free to PM me on here if you play there and we'll get together for some fellowship or something about a couple of buildings."	t5_2qlxw	True

Anyway, friend and I who got a copy were talking about our overall MMORPG cost. So I actually figured mine out:

&gt; Everquest 29.99 (7 months at 9.99 = 69.93)

&gt; Asheron's Call 19.99 (3 months at 12.99 = 38.97)

&gt; FFXI 2008 Collection for free + WotG 8.99 (28 months sub at 12.99 = 363.72)

&gt; Wow Battlechest + Wotlk + Cata 129.97 + Charity Pets 30 + Other Pets 30 + Special Mounts 20 (35 months at 11.99 = 499.65)

&gt; Rift 9.99 + 9.99 CE Upgrade (2 months at 12.99 and One year pass of 99.99 = 125.97)

&gt; FFXIV 12.99 (No sub)

&gt; Aion 19.99 (4 months of sub at 11.99 = 47.96)

&gt; Everquest 2 Gold 19.99 (2 months at 12.99 = 25.98)

&gt; SWToR 59.99 (No sub) -- I think I was drugged that day :\

&gt; Tera 20.0 (No sub)

**So that makes a grand total of $1,524.06 since 2000 equaling real monthly cost of $10.58375**

Seems astronomical at first, until I figured out the overall monthly cost. Basically two meals at McDonalds. "	t5_2qlxw	True

If you're looking for something to do and don't want to spend a dime check this out!  I was surfing around a bunch of MMO sites for the last month looking for a new game to play.  I've done the gambit: everything from Ultima Online to Guild Wars 2 and everything in between.  If it was a big name MMO I've played it and if it wasn't but had a free trial then I've given it a shot.  I have to say though, in all the years I've been playing these things, I've never been as captivated as I have been the last week with Vanguard.  I'd tried it a year or two ago but something else caught my attention and I didn't give it a second thought.  Today though, with the addition of a free to play model, the community is being reborn as old vets and newbies like myself come together to rediscover this MASSIVELY overlooked gem!


The game doesn't hold your hand as newer ones do, but the community is always helpful and I've yet to run into anyone being mean or rude for the hell of it.  Websites like [VGInterface](http://vginterface.com/) offer amazing interface mods to help update the slightly aging look and maps, (I would definitely reccomend the [InfoMap](http://www.soresha.net/infomap/) mod at the very least).  If you're confused by the way the various in-game systems work, [The Telon Project](http://www.thetelonproject.com/) has a wealth of information to guide you in the amazingly in depth crafting system.

I could go on and on about this game forever but I beg you to go check it out for yourself!  Now if you don't mind me, I need to finish crafting my ship to go sailing and look for a place to build the house I'll be crafting down the road :D"	t5_2qlxw	True

EVE - I really like it, but the skill system is too slow. I feel like im just waiting for the next skill to finish. I would like to get deeper into the corp though. 

WoW - I LOVED end game raiding with my group of raiders, but the time it took to get there just isnt going to happen. Especially now when MoP is close to release. 

Bunch of other MMOs - I hate questing (Kill x creatures. Kill X named creature. Gather X goods. Travel to X). I don't like FPS's. 

I'm going to take a look at the sidebar links but suggestions are appreciated.

1376565954.0	1keuy0	So what MMORPG should we play until WildStar/EQN/ESO come out?	Newklol	14	7	66	"Hi,

After being in a very successful raidng guild in WoW for a long time I stopped playing a year ago and haven't touched it since. It just wasn't exciting anymore and felt too much like ""work"" and also I didn't have so much time for it anymore because of my job.

I tried a lot of different games after that: Diablo 3 (no mmo...), Guild Wars 2 (no endgame...), Eve (really boring...), Defiance (shooter ...) and a lot of other coop and versus multiplayer games with some friends really, but nothing kept us playing for very long.

GW2 was most promising, but it simply has no endgame at all. There is no way to improve the character after hitting the max level and then there is really nothing to do.

However I do like to get a legendary Item once in a while (for all those who don't play borderlands a legendary item is a powerful weapon that has a very low chance to drop from a fallen enemies corpse, and generally are very powerful). It seems though that the chances are so low that the only way is to ""grind"" for hours and hours on a boss until it drops and even then your not guaranteed one. As some one who has actually done this I can tell you it gets frustrating, and puts a bad taste in my mouth about the game itself. Unfortunately many MMORPGs have been doing the grind game as a substitute for better gameplay. for example a game may boast 20+ hours  of game play but how much of that is traveling to an area, fighting the same  monsters over and over, or watching cut scenes/quick time events (Morrowwind was an example of this and so when fast travel was created that became the new standard).
 Now I am not trying to say that all games that involve grind are bad games, but what I would like is to reward people for grinding, more so then what is being done now. for example in Borderlands you have a certain percent chance that such and such item will drop from an enemy, I think it would be cool if Borderlands could record how many times you have ""grinded"" on that boss, and increases the chances of rarer loot by a small margin per instance.
 I also think that this would be a useful technique for other MMORPGs. Imagine you are guaranteed an Item (not maybe), how much more would you be willing to work for that item, thus the games would be played more for the fact that there is a realistic goal that can be achieved. Anyway just my thoughts this morning tell me what you think.   "	t5_2qlxw	True

I've been an avid Dark Souls player for the last year and I absolutely love the atmosphere, mechanics, and freedom to build your character however you want (i.e. no classes). I realize that there's no MMO in existence that has the mechanics that a game like Dark Souls offers, however I'm wondering if perhaps there is one that shares the darker themes and character build freedom.

The main qualifier to be considered a ""stealther"" in the scope of this question is always on stealth.

You can argue that WoW Rogues/Druids are close, especially if you consider gear advantage to be equal to a buff bot. The main issue here is that there are so many forms of cc breaking/escape in WoW that catching someone long enough to get the kill becomes a chore.

Most modern MMOs do not have always on stealth, so a lot of games are filtered out based on that.

1366324880.0	1cn08m	The End vs The Journey		12	2	6	"So, I've recently been hit with overwhelming amounts of nostalgia and the urge to start playing online games again, specifically MMO's. I wanted to give you guys and girls out there a brief history of my MMO experiences and get your opinions on something that I think has changed the MMO genre and mindset of players going into new/old MMO's.

So, I started my first MMO way back when right around 2003-2004 during the friends and family alpha of World of Warcraft. WoW, was my first MMO, but not my first online game. I had been playing a large quantity of FPS games online at the time like Counter-Strike, Battlefield, Team Fortress, Day of Defeat, etc. So being in a somewhat online community was not new to me. However, the vast difference between an MMO and FPS-Online game was new.

I played WoW up until very recently, about 6 months ago. Quitting on and off more often as the more expansions came out. In vanilla WoW the level cap was 60, it took 1-3 months, at least, to get to that point depending on who you are and how fast you play. There wasn't much to do along the way, and there was A LOT of grouping for certain quests and instances, etc. Once you got to 60 you didn't have much to do aside from running the instances, raiding and farming rep. All of these activities required extensive levels and time of commitment to get the end result. Even the best of guilds spent 4-6 hours in Molten Core only getting about 16-20 pieces of gear total for 40 players. It took weeks/months of farming reputation with the earlier reps like Silithus/Thorium Brotherhood to get what you needed from them for bosses. I enjoyed these types of long term activities because it gave me something to look forward to.

Once Burning Crusade was released the game started to lean, very slightly, towards everything being easier. The game still required extensive time investment in a lot of areas but as time went on the game was made more accessible to people with less time and less willingness to spend every waking minute on the computer. Which from a business standpoint makes perfect sense, if I was running a business I would be maximizing my efforts to make money.

From what I have heard, the other couple MMO's out at the time such as Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot, Lineage, etc were all just as intensive as far as time commitment is concerned. To some extent some of those games still are in some areas.

If you look at WoW, or any other MMO today, substantial amounts of time investment doesn't really seem to be there. WoW is all about the casual player now, everything takes only a few short weeks of time to obtain, most of which takes even less time than that. You can level to max level in less than a month, and be in full epics less than a month later.

I have tried almost every single MMO that exists, with the exception of the free to play ones, and almost all of them take little to no time to get to max level. From my experience, most of the MMO's today are about a simple task, get to max level, do the same activity over and over until you get the one item you seek. This as I am sure will be pointed out to me, is called the gear treadmill, or carrot on the stick.

One example I want to throw in here about Rift. When Rift first came out, I rushed to 50, or the cap, and immediately started farming instances for gear. Well I was a tank, and my friend was a healer, we were both extremely well versed in instances/raiding from our time with WoW. However, it still took us 2-4 hours to complete 1 instance in Rift. We found this unacceptable and left the game. We were brain washed by WoW in the sense that, if an instance takes longer than 30 minutes, it's a waste of time. I feel as though, had Rift come out at the same time as WoW, these lengthy instances would not have been looked at in the same fashion, because at that time, WoW would have never changed the dynamic of instances.

I feel as though, and the point of my post is the determination of whether or not anyone else agrees, that the progression of WoW's business system and success has led other MMO developers to follow suit and try to match their success. I feel like because of WoW, and the time I spent with it, when I start a new MMO, my soul focus is, blast through every quest and completely ignore everything until I get to max level. I have never played an MMO to enjoy the game itself as opposed to the end result.

I don't feel as though this is the game's fault, but my mindset from my extensive tenure with WoW. I dream of a day where someone finds the solution or the counter-point to the gear treadmill or carrot. Ultimately no matter what MMO you play, it's always about maxing everything out and getting the best gear. I dream of never allowing myself to play WoW, then I think I might be able enjoy a games content as opposed to it's endgame. I severely desire playing MMO's again, however I feel as though I will never be able to genuinely enjoy one again because of what WoW has taught me, mentally. Every MMO that isn't based around a certain model these days is frowned upon, it seems a lot of the negativity towards Defiance is that it isn't like every other MMO, why is that a bad thing?

So my question for you is this, when you play an MMO these days, is it for ""The Journey"" or ""The End""? Have you played WoW? Do you feel as though it affects your ability to enjoy other games? Do you find any current MMO's to provide with you pure enjoyment throughout as opposed to only at the end? Do you have any MMO's that you would recommend to someone trying to change their style of thinking when it comes to MMO's?

Ultimately, what makes the MMO you play so important to you? Why do you enjoy it, and what makes it stand out from every other cookie cutter MMO out there?

1363707430.0	1aliea	Can't decide on a upcoming MMO...	abyssea	10	1	11	"For the longest time, I've been waiting for Everquest Next (3) to be released, get more information about it, etc and nothing really until apparently the end of this year. And that's at the earliest. While I, along with others, are basically pining for its release, there are other MMORPGs I've been interested in. Those are FFXIV 2.0 and TESO.

I tried out FFXIV 2.0 and while it is a huge improvement over FFXIV 1.0, I just felt like I was playing a prettier version of WoW/Rift. Although only about 5% of the game was open. So I can't make much of a judgement there.

I've also really enjoyed TES series and have read up on information for TESO. I do like how it won't use the traditional ES interface (for an MMO that would be very difficult). I don't like how player housing isn't available (at least at launch). But things like massive server, amazing graphics, story and lore is what has me mainly interested. Plus I want an MMO that can sit at for years and not get too bored from (not talking about occasional breaks) because I'm also very tired of MMO hopping, trying to find a good MMO that isn't a copycat or something else poorly implemented. 

Must haves would be - player housing (atleast in the works at release), auction house, stability, good music (I still have FFXI, EQ2 and some WoW music in my head from time to time), a good player base, good crafting system (around GW2 and Aion complexity), an achievement system (yes, I said it) and the more open the better as far as exploration.

Some extras that would be nice but not deal breaker - battleground type PvP (I mainly PvE), social networking interaction (although I've never used it in any MMO I've played), in game marriage (for those people even though I'd probably marry a mule/alt of mine if there was a in game housing bonus or something), player bazaar (although I'd rather a auction house).

I'm looking for a new MMORPG to play but it should be in Beta because I want to play it from its beginning. It should have a action combat system like TERA and I'd prefer if it was P2P.
I hope you can help me."	t5_2qlxw	True

I currently own guild wars 2 but I felt the lack of pets was unappealing. Are there any other alternatives to MMOs with just really in depth and well thought out pet systems? Or just suggestions for games to try would be great as well, thanks!	t5_2qlxw	True

1361265961.0	18t6sl	Is there a MMO with fun PvP?	opinions_	12	3	24	"* It should be released (I, too, am waiting for ESO/CU/AA)

* It should have PvP progression. 

* I prefer open world, but instanced is fine too if it is well done



MMOs that I have played and why I stopped:

* daoc. The expansions ruined it

* WAR. not worthy of a subscription. If they went F2P I might give it another chance

* GW2. No progression. No trinity. I hate the downed mechanic. sPvP is cut off from the rest of the game. WvW is all about mindlessly zerging keeps. 

* WoW. Shittiest community. Arenas and BGs got boring very quickly.

* RoM. Would have been great if it wasn't P2W."	t5_2qlxw	True

Examples: 
Trickster Online - Absolute garbage combat (and overall) but somewhat made pleasant by the entire game world being covered in buried treasure, and everyone able to equip Pneumatic Drills to dig it out.

Wakfu: It's got a stunning Enviromentalism system, a squee inducing portable player housing and a combat system akin to being a character from Fire Emblem, while being completely full of crazy design decisions. (Class balance is beyond silly, End game dungeon that opens for 1 minute every week at 6am, crafting disciplines requiring non-existant items and actually being impossible to level)

Any other gems that have really shined out at you, while being sadly being sandwiched in a turd sandwich of an MMO?"	t5_2qlxw	True

I recently posted a survey link in this sub-reddit to explore the benefits of MMO gaming for adults and protective factors against addiction.  First, thank you to everyone who has taken a few minutes to take the survey.  Second, we have just passed the 300 mark in the number of participants and are nearing the initial goal of 500!  
Unfortunately, the pace of people taking the survey has been slowing so please encourage other adult MMO gamers you know to take these brief questionnaires and take it yourself if you haven't already.

Below is a link to the anonymous survey.  Please take it if you are at least 18 years of age and play massively multiplayer online games.  There is a link at the end of the survey that will allow you to provide a valid email address that enters you in a raffle for one of five $20 Amazon.com gift certificates.  You do not need to enter the raffle and your email address (if you chose to provide one) will be kept separate from your responses and not used for any other purposes.

What are needed in order to improve the current state of questing? My friends and I thought about this while looking back out our previous games/MMOs. Most of us found that Runescape's questing system was very nice and were actually quests instead of tasks. Another said that implementing GW2's dynamic events/quests while having Runescape Questing style will make a nice change to the system. 	t5_2qlxw	True

I've been in contact with the developers of the game Black Deserts which has been half-hyped over various forums for a while. You might have heard it from the reddit post I did a couple of weeks ago. Now, I'm soon going to do an interview and if there is anything you would like me to ask them, please leave you question here!
