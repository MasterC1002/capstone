After hiking Diamond Head with my 2 year old daughter, I thought I'd see if we could find a snack before we headed home.  A large yellow truck made my daughter exclaim ""School Bus!""  It was instead, Magoo's Burgers.  We walked up to the food truck and I asked ""Are you guys cash only?""  I was not surprised when a middle aged man in the truck replied, ""yes.""  What did surprise me, to a great deal, is his counter question, ""Did you guys just finish going up?""  I probably threw him a weird look, but I replied that we had.  Without hesitation he said, ""I'll make her an ice.""  

And he did.  He let us pick the flavors, made it perfectly, and charged us nothing.  My daughter absolutely loved it.  Relaxing at the bottom of Diamond Head with Shave Ice and a calm breeze will go down as one of my favorite memories here.  I know it probably sounds trivial, but I was deeply touched.  If you ever find yourself by a big yellow truck with ""Magoo's Burgers"" on it- pay them a visit!"	t5_2qi3u	True

1376614928.0	1kghvm	Oahu- help me find my brother before our mom dies	smaches	91	18	50	"My brother stopped contacting our family last October for no reason at all.  I don't think he died, but I do think he's had some sort of mental break.

He stopped contacting his entire family despite the fact that there was no fight, no drama, nothing. Last we heard from him was when my mom asked him what address to send his Christmas present to.  

He unfriended us all on facebook, but some mutual friends contacted me to let me know that his posts had become erratic and well, crazy. He started writing song lyrics to famous songs, claiming he wrote them. He's made several rambling posts about how the goverment was watching him, he's claimed to invent everyday objects, and pretty much stopped making sense of any kind. 

We tracked down his former landlord. After he stopped talking to us he asked her if she had any rentals available, and she told us that he seemed strange and kept rambling about conspiracy theories. We talked to the woman in charge of his storage unit and she said the same thing. Anyone who's seen him has said he's been acting very odd.

He's was living in Honolulu and traveling back and forth to Iceland before all this happened.  I think he went to Iceland after we last spoke, but he always goes back to Honolulu and considers it home. He find temporary rentals, camps, and stays in hostels.  I haven't seen him post anything on the internet since about last April.

I'm afraid he's become homeless and is living rough on the island. Why else would his phone be turned off and have no access to the internet? In his last posted pic, his hair was long and straggly and it looked like he had lost at least 25 lbs. He used to be in great shape and he just looked gaunt and unkept.  I'm afraid something bad has happened to him.

To top it all off, our mom just got diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She has about 50% change to survive. She misses him so much and asks about him every day.

If I had any money I'd fly out there and post flyers and drive around until I saw him. I've been there a couple times before and I know it's not a big place.

His name is Shane Flaten and he's 32 years old. He's 5'7, long brown hair and blue eyes. He's from Minnesota originally and he might tell you he's a commodities broker. When he has money he tries to stay in Honolulu itself, near the beach and all the vacation rentals. When he doesn't, he camps or finds room to rent on other parts of the island. He particularly likes making friends with international travellers, so if you're visiting Oahu, keep an eye out for him please!

Any information, sightings, anything would help!  I just want to find him and talk to him before our mom dies.   Thank you for your help, Hawaii.

I've been hiking the islands since 06 and have never heard of this many incidents happen in such a short span of time.

**Just this past weekend:**

[A woman fell 300 feet to her death](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/22662780/woman) on Puu Manamana Trail. Like most trails in Ka'a'awa, this trail is pretty hazardous even for experienced hikers. This woman had just moved to the island 8 months ago and thought she was ready to take it on during a weekend of rain showers. **The ʻaina doesn't care how tough you think you are, where you've hiked before, or where you're from. Know your limits!**


[A rock slide in Manoa](http://www.kitv.com/news/hawaii/3-hikers-injured-from-rockslide-in-manoa/-/8905354/20678254/-/10u1bxk/-/index.html) injured three resulting in a seven year old to get air lifted to a hospital. Just because you are hiking an ""easy"" trail does not exempt you from freak accidents.

[An elderly Korean man died](http://www.khon2.com/2013/06/24/hiker-who-died-after-falling-from-mariners-ridge-trail-identified/) on Mariner's Ridge where he attempted to climb down the [rock scramble to the lower peak that heads over to the KST west] (http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/slideshow?widgetid=83580) (towards Kuliouou). I can safely assume he tried this in order to get a better shot for her camera as I've personally witnessed people climbing the exact same spot before to get group pictures. **Once again, know your limits, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger because shit does in fact happen.**

This one takes the cake though. [A group of seven were gallivanting Kaau crater when a wild group of pigs appears!] (http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=22676265) It's super effective because apparently it scared them so bad they ran away off the trail, got lost, called 911, then eventually found their way back and lied to rescuers about ever calling for help.

These events are just from this weekend, but the over the last few months there have been people falling off the lighthouse, [getting stranded due to weather](http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20130528_Maui_helicopter_rescues_12_stranded_hikers_at_Haiku.html?id=209301811), [falling off waterfalls](http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/139342293.html?id=139342293), having heart attacks on top of stairway to heaven, and countless other people [getting lost](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21083864/hikers-stranded-overnight-near-stairway-to-heaven-trail)/[hurt resulting in helicopters lifting them out](http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20130518_Fire_helicopter_plucks_fallen_hiker_from_Koko_Crater_trail.html?id=208037001). The hiking community is [catching some bad press](http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/22665419/man-dies-while-hiking-mariners-ridge-trail) and hopefully it doesn't result in stricter trespassing laws, fines, closing of trails etc. from some sort of knee-jerk legislation passed to remedy the outbreak of incidents lately.

There are a bunch of great hiking groups/clubs throughout the state that will gladly take you in and show you the ropes. If you are new to hiking or visiting or know someone who is I strongly urge you to consider joining some of these guys versus reading a hiking blog and doing it yourself.

1359169899.0	17aoz3	Warning to those flying out of Honolulu	Amphigorey	80	15	57	"The TSA, as everyone knows, is awful. Honolulu Airport is cursed with some notable specimens. I flew out on Wednesday and had a terrible experience with Stso. Parker and her supervisor, Michael Cain.

I opted out of the naked scanners and so had to be patted down. Parker picked up my things from the X-Ray, and she stacked the bins. I asked her to please not stack the bins because one of my items was fragile, and she completely ignored me. I tried to get her attention politely, but she would not acknowledge anything I said. Fortunately nothing broke, but not through any effort of Parker's.

Things got worse from there. She gave me a brief spiel about the pat-down, then told me to turn around and hold my hands out so she could start. She was rough from the beginning. She flung my hair aside and ran her hands roughly down my back. I flinched away because I was startled, and then with no warning she pulled my shirt up and yanked on my waistband, which was not something she'd warned me about in the spiel. 

This was unlike any other TSA patdown I've received. Normally the agents are professional and polite, and they narrate as they're giving the patdown. Parker was silent. Even though I was clearly uncomfortable, she continued the pat-down by running her hand up my leg and hitting my groin hard. At that point, I said ""HEY!"" and turned around, and asked her to please warn me before she touched any sensitive areas.

She flatly refused. She just said ""I'm not required to do that,"" and I said that I was just making a small request, that all I wanted was a verbal warning, and she said she'd already given me the warnings at the beginning, and that was all she was required to do. I said I'd never had a patdown like that, and she said ""We don't change our procedures for anyone."" She also called me a liar when I said that every other TSA patdown I've had included a narration. 

Because I was uncomfortable with her rough pat-down, she and two other TSA agents escorted me out of security. By this point, I was very upset, and they wouldn't answer my questions about what was happening. After they pushed me out of the exit, they told me that I'd made the ""choice"" to not submit to the search, and that I wouldn't be allowed back through security. (They did not tell me this directly; they just told each other ""Make sure she doesn't come in again."") This was a lie: At no point did I say I was refusing the search. I was only asking for warnings during the search. This is an incredibly small and reasonable request, and the TSA's response was ridiculous and outsized. 

Stso. Parker abused her authority by kicking me out as soon as I made a very small protest. She was clearly retaliating against me because I'd complained about the rough treatment. She should not be in a position of authority, and she should certainly not be patting people down the way she does. She was incredibly disrespectful and rude to me from the very start. She also refused to look at me or make eye contact, which I found extremely creepy. 

Eventually, I was able to talk with her supervisor, Michael Cain. He never apologized, but he did say that I would be able to go through security if I was willing to undergo a search. I said I wouldn't go through the scanner, but the metal detector was fine. Mr. Cain told me that the scanners weren't millimeter wave, which is a lie: Honolulu Airport uses the L-3 millimeter wave scanners. He also told me that I would go through the metal detector, which also turned out to be a lie. He escorted me to the front of the line, and then disappeared completely. I was confused, and the other agent waved me towards the scanner. I said no, Mr Cain the supervisor gave me permission to go through the metal detector (which were in use, so I wasn't asking for anything special), but the agent just shook his head. Since I could not see Cain anywhere, I had no choice but to opt out once again and go through another pat-down.

When I came to the search area, there was Mr Cain, who was obviously waiting for this. There was a different agent to do the pat-down, and she was perfectly professional. She was gentle and she narrated things as she did them, so the pat-down went smoothly. Cain watched, although it was clearly not for my comfort, but to make sure that I didn't cause any more ""trouble"" for his agents. 

This kind of thing should not be normal. What happened to me was a minor violation on the scale of atrocities that the TSA has commited, but it was still too much. Their reaction to my tiny protest was deeply out of proportion to what I did. This is how police states work.

TL;DR: Stso. Parker of the Honolulu TSA is abusive and will kick you out at the smallest provocation. If you are unlucky enough to encounter her, ask for a different agent."	t5_2qi3u	True

If you have any feedback or suggestions feel free to post them in this thread or shoot me a private message.

There are other UI changes currently being tested that that will show up in the next few days. Currently we're testing

* A red downvote honu to easily distinguish between upvotes and downvotes
* Theming the link colors for threads
* Tweaking the overall color scheme of the subreddit to a green/ocean blue look
* Various other small tweaks 

Furthermore, reddit is planning on rolling out a wiki system for subreddits. This will be used as a location to store F.A.Q.s that we currently just link to in the side bar.

Finally, upvote for visibility. This is a self post so I get no karma for it.

Mahalo for your time.

Edit: typo

**Edit: Cayou came up with a great idea of implementing some generic Hawaiian user flair icons. Things such as honus, waves, shaka, etc. I'm a terrible artist, but if there are any artists out there that want to create some generic icons, I can set them up as flair.**

Amenities include billiards table, ping pong table (most likely used for the inevitable beer pong tournament), dart board, full rock band set and a grill if we choose to cook some meats. Bring what you want to drink, but I'll probably buy a 30 pack of cheap shit and have a handle of captain on hand. The more the merrier, last time was a pretty big turnout (surprisingly)

My address is 98-221 Kanuku St, Aiea. I prefer people to come in the Moanalua Loop route [here](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=200261949032426543375.0004bb7b1e4d6a18c0c2e&amp;msa=0) as the house configuration is a bit odd and my neighbor doesn't really appreciate people walking up his driveway. If necessary though its fine. If  you are coming up from Kanuku or my garage happens to be closed when you show up please send a text, (810) 627 9236.

For clarification, meet up is on the 31st. Show up whenever you want. I expect it to go well into the night. Parking on Moanalua loop can be on the side of the road. If you are busing, the closest bus stops at the Anna Millers/Bravo.

The girl is 15 years old and answers to Nohea. She went to school (finding out which one) on Tuesday and has not been seen since that morning. If you are out and about please keep an eye out for her.
After talking with the stepfather everything had SEEMED just fine up until her date of disappearance. No troubles at home or school that they knew of, they had just returned from a fun trip in vegas and everything seemed just fine. 
If she did run away keep in mind she may have cut or died her hair, or tried to alter her appearance in other ways. It's Friday and its FIRST Friday at that so if she did run away she will probably be out having a good time tonight. Lets hope this is the case and she will be found. If you have any information or you see this girl please call HPD.

* Rainbow drive-in plate lunch (should be on the list)
* Ailana shave ice (should be on the list)

Here are my questions: 

* Although our world is so mobile now, and populations are constantly moving around, what are the thoughts among descendants of native Hawaiians when it comes to preserving a pure race? Is that important to some people?

* Seeing the islands of Hawaii madeover into a manufactured tourist spot, what are some ways that the culture/heritage of Hawaii are kept intact? Are there any traditions that are kind of purposely hidden away from visitors, something you can just call your own? 

* I noticed that Hawaiian dancers in the past (when the dances were done for spiritual purposes) were primarily men, but now that tourists come and expect to be entertained, the dancers are women. What are some other things that have been ""tweaked"" like that for the sake of vacationers?

* Do you think it is unfair that there is a certain percentage of native Hawaiian blood necessary to qualify for government benefits (like going to school for free or having rights to land)?

Anyway, since this topic is new to me and I hadn't been given this food for thought til today, I haven't formed any solid opinions or projected answers regarding the above questions that I have. So, thanks redditors! Hope you can give me some interesting perspectives. :) "	t5_2qi3u	True

We're not looking for any group consensus or anything like that, just robust discussion that can hopefully lead to some of your comments and insight helping our news coverage on Election Day. 

To be clear, we won't use your comments in our stories without talking to you directly about it first, and getting your name and other basic information just to identify you in our work. I've already reached out to the moderators to ask permission to post this thread and verify who I am, and you're welcome to look me up online or call our Honolulu AP bureau if you have any questions (for ease, the number is 808-536-5510), or PM me here, ask me on this thread or email me at ogarcia@ap.org. I'm also @oskargarcia on Twitter, if you prefer that. 

Above all, thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and insight! Here are a few questions to touch off the discussion: 

-- Is there any one issue or race that most motivated you to vote this cycle? (ie. the presidential race, rail on Oahu, the balance of power in U.S. Senate)

-- Who did you vote for for U.S. Senate: U.S. Rep. Mazie Hirono, the Democrat, or former Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle, the Republican? Why?

-- Who did you vote for in the U.S. House races? (Hanabusa/Djou, Gabbard/Crowley)

-- Who did you vote for for president? If you voted for Obama, how important were his Hawaii roots to you? If you voted for Romney, were Obama's Hawaii connections a factor in any way? 

-- Which of the local races did you pay attention to most? Honolulu mayor? Hawaii County mayor? What was most important to you about these races? 

-- Did you have any trouble at all actually voting? There were problems on the Big Island during the primary, did you experience any issues (especially if you live there)?

Thanks again! Throughout election night, I'll share and post our AP stories related to Hawaii in this thread, so you can see what we're up to. Like I said, hopefully this turns into a robust and insightful discussion focused on what matters to you in Hawaii! 

**EDIT:** Wow! Just want to say I'm stoked to see the response this has gotten so far and I look forward to seeing it keep up as the ballots close and the results start coming in. First thing in the AM, I'll share links to our stories and updates as I can give them. And hopefully I'll have the privilege of talking to many more of you directly once the sun comes up. Thank you again!

**EDIT 2 (7:30a Tuesday)** Here's some reading material. Other things as they develop will likely be posted in comments:

Suggested format:

Please try to keep the top posts to events only, additional comments below the event posts are AOK.  However, for this starter thread, we're also seeking suggestions, so go for it!

This is a new idea, and we'll be tweaking the frequency of these posts, so if weekly is too often, we'll move to monthly instead.

1364446463.0	1b5so7	UPDATE: Is it worth fighting a traffic ticket in Honolulu? (Yes)	SVPERBVS	36	10	8	"I originally posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/192mo5/is_it_worth_fighting_a_traffic_ticket_in_honolulu/) asking all of you about whether to challenge a ticket... I did, and it was a success. Thanks for all the input!

I submitted the paperwork, received some court documents w/ my court date listed. I recommend getting there just a little early just to get situated, but make no mistake, you will be spending time at the courthouse (I was there for about 1.5 hours).

When I got there, I noticed most folks were wearing very casual clothing, I wore a button up and khakis, I figured it couldn't hurt to look presentable.

You are seated, the bailiff (she was very forward, borderline impolite and impatient) will take your name and you'll be called in alphabetical order (but if you have a lawyer, you'll be heard first).

The judge definitely had his BS-detector on, and if you plan of having a fluff story it's likely not going to fly. He was, however, pretty reasonable in hearing out any mitigating circumstances and took great liberty to reduce fines, unless the violation carried a mandatory fine.

As for me, I came up to the stand, he asked if I admitted to the charge, admitted w/ an explanation, or denied. I denied, and explained what had happened, trying to keep it short and sweet. I had my witness (wife) but he said it wouldn't be necessary to hear from her. He took a few minutes too look at his computer screen, and I guess the police officer entered notes about when I was stopped. The judge said my story lined up w/ what I said at the time I was cited, I didn't realize the officer would enter his own notes that aren't included in the citation. The judge said he believed me, said I had a clean driving record: ""Case is dismissed."" ""Thank you, your honor"" and that was that.

tl;dr It was worth fighting the ticket, got it dismissed. Be/look professional, be polite, be confident when speaking, make sure to have a logical explanation, and don't try to BS the judge."	t5_2qi3u	True

We've tried to go away [from](http://access.wa.gov/) the [usual](http://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html) styles [and](http://ny.gov/) approaches [taken](http://access.wa.gov/)  by various state portals, and hopefully shake things up a bit.  Everything is arranged into four simple categories, and we've tried to heavily focus on making navigation as intuitive as possible which has meant throwing out some preconceptions about how things should be.
Let's be honest, you don't really care all that much *which* department it is you need to contact about, say, getting camping permits.  Nor should knowing be a requisite for buying one.  You just want to get a camping permit!

On the tech front, if you'll excuse the buzz-word bingo: it's using an HTML5 based, mobile-first, responsive design (so it automatically provides the best layout for your devices resolution, and doesn't waste time downloading large content on small screens), that is touch-enabled and data driven (if you know of any good data feeds to show, we'd love to hear about them!)

All content is generated hourly from markdown format (same thing reddit uses for comments) into HTML by ruby/jekyll, meaning our web-servers can just get on with giving you the site rather than trying to figure out what to present.  It's quicker for you, and less resource intensive for us.  It's also helped us to rapidly prototype the site and get it into fit form for bringing live, from concept to final product has taken barely 2 months!

One of the hardest aspects of website design is the sheer number of devices and web browser combinations out there.  We've done our absolute best to get this working as bug-free as possible on every platform but if you do find you're getting problems please let me know or drop a line to our support (info at ehawaii dot gov), and let us know what device, browser and what you were seeing!

My colleague Audrey McAvoy (Reddit newbie /u/audreymcavoy) is writing a story about a long-term decline in tradewinds and what this may mean for life in Hawaii. The starting off point for the article is a study co-authored by UH meteorologist Pao-shin Chu, documenting a 27 percent drop in tradewind days since the 1970s. 

What we'd like to know from you: Have you noticed fewer tradewind days lately? Are you concerned about this decline? How do you think it affects you or others on the islands? 

We're hoping this discussion can ultimately lead to some of your comments and insight helping our news coverage on this.
To be clear, we won't use your comments in our stories without talking to you directly about it first, and getting your name and other basic information just to identify you in our work. I've already reached out to the moderators to ask permission to post this thread. If you want to talk to us outside this thread, you're welcome to call our Honolulu AP bureau (808-536-5510), email Audrey at amcavoy@ap.org or myself at ogarcia@ap.org, or PM us here. I'm also @oskargarcia on Twitter, if you prefer that.

Above all, thanks for your insight!

I remember a lot of good things, but I also experienced ""Kill (or Get) Haole Day"" in school (is that still a thing?) - I wasn't caught, but it was a close thing two of those years.

Anyone here old enough to give some perspective on changes (good and/or bad) from the 70s through today?

I know traffic is horrible now. I can street map and see my old neighborhoods and how much more built up they are now. Prices were high back then as they are now. 

Some good things I remember:

* Checkers and Pogo (I won a cheap camera on that show!)
* Kikaida
* The big carpet slide somewhere outside Honolulu
* Going nuts playing hide-and-seek with my sister in the International Market Place (and my parents were fine with that so long as we met them at a predetermined place at the right time - we were younger than 10 when we first started doing this!)
* Farrells Ice Cream Parlor Birthdays!
* Ala Moana Center was still brand-new and completely awesome to play in.
* Managed to swim to Chinaman's Hat (is it still named that in these P.C. times?), accompanied by adults both in the water and in a power boat - rode the boat back.
* Regularly went to the Key Hole/Toilet Bowl (whatever that park is called) and just snorkeled to the less-crowded areas, or spent many hours stalking the tide pools.
* In fact, a large amount of my time there was spent just exploring the wildlife wherever I was.
* My food horizons, especially with Asian food, expanded dramatically - I was the only kid (haole or not) in the neighborhood who'd save his allowance to buy street vendor nori balls instead of shave ice/ice cream. Yeah, I still like to joke that that I am apparently a hipster for liking sushi et. al. long before it became popular on the mainland.
* The whole ""aunty/uncle"" thing - which applied to nearly all my elders in the neighborhood, except for elderly Japanese men who tended to insist on *name*-san.
* Pidgin was fun - and also got me picked on when we moved back to the mainland.

It was a good time to be a kid then - is that still the case? I'd like to take my wife there and do a extensive revisit.

edit: welp, 2:30 a.m. here, and I see that's this is already 4up/2down, so I'm guessing it's not going to get much traction, so I'm off to bed. I'll check back in any case later this morning.

In a thread I posted earlier, I mentioned wanting to start a geographically close network to offset bandwidth and traffic snooping issues with local ISPs. I've *finally* settled in to my new digs and have my server rack set up so the games can begin. What I'd like to do in this thread is to get the groundwork going. I'm going to throw out some ideas and I'd like to get some feedback (and other ideas) from people. I know there are at least a few people who are well versed in computer networking. If you are not one of those people, not a problem. I can provide ""training"".

## Please join us in IRC on irc.freenode.net in channel \#rhawaii for live discussion. I will be posting a new thread with more granular details about the project shortly.

As it stands right now, I have a +10 dBi panel antenna configured as such:

## (EDIT AGAIN: I've set up a +15 dBi omnidirectional (360 degrees of signal, no more bearing) antenna with the same settings as below. I doubt anyone lives close enough to connect but give it a shot anyhow.

* **Location:** [21.349924, -157.927402](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=21.349924,+-157.927402&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=58.076329,117.685547&amp;t=h&amp;z=17)
* **SSID/network name:** TaosHumAlpha (no password needed)

Right now, it shows up as an ad-hoc wireless network. If you can see it and connect to it, *please do*. It's connected to an old Presario 700 laptop running DSL with XAMPP installed. I still have to configure it with a real site, but it's there. I have another server and another laptop I will most likely be adding to the mix, as well as another panel antenna. I will also be swapping this connection out for a real wireless router with swappable antennae.

Here are the things I'm proposing and on which I'm asking for feedback:

* Network protocol! I have a Cisco 851 router without the advanced IP services IOS image so I can't use IPv6 yet (unless one of you with Hawaiian Telecom or other Cisco reseller connections can get me a *cheap* Smartnet contract for my router so I can download the newest IOS for it...) but I would **really like to use IPv6 if possible**, admittedly simply for the sake of using IPv6. Otherwise, IPv4 subnets would work just fine.
* Top-level domains: I propose .odn for **O**ahu **d**ark**n**et (I can host DNS services and I can show others how to do it as well... I also wrote my own DNS server software that will run in Windows with almost zero configuration if anyone is interested...)
* Secure P2P file sharing: Freenet is a package that already exists but I'm also open to suggestions... such as writing one myself using HTTPS...
* Connecting remote sites: Powerline communication for short distances (can be purchased at any Best Buy or Walmart, look for ""HomeAV"" stuff) and transparent LAN services for more remote sites (EDIT: haven't tested it, but apparently most of these devices are ""smart"" enough to limit their signal to in-building wiring); DD-WRT has EoIP and DD-WRT capable routers can be bought almost anywhere. VPN is another option and OpenVPN will run on almost anything... including DD-WRT routers... This *may* have an impact on your bandwidth usage, though. I don't know how the local ISPs calculate that. (Does the traffic have to go outside of their autonomous system? Does it just have to traverse their distribution routers?) I know that Clear has a transit agreement with Time Warner, and Time Warner has an undersea pipe to Palo Alto, but I don't know about Hawaiian Telecom or anyone else. I have Time Warner's business class data so I don't get bandwidth caps... so it's no issue for me to host something like this.

If you've lived on Maui for any length of time, you've probably at least heard of him.  He busts everybody, there are rumors about his crookedness and resentment of his history with the police (supposedly shot some guy in the 80's/90's on O'ahu, got transferred to Maui and had a huge pay cut, since then has been gaming the system by constantly and consistently ticketing people for the smallest traffic violations and other things in order to get yearly bonuses and such.  Pay he feels he deserves).

Word on the street is his hands were swabbed by TSA at the Kahului airport on Maui, and the alarm went off due to whatever may have been on his hands.  As is protocol, he was then given a patdown and in response got all nuts, yelling and throwing a tantrum.  I even heard he took statements from other ""witnesses"" in line.  Since he's so infamous, some of the workers present are said to have taken a little satisfaction in seeing his discomfort, and might have been smirking or giggling.  Since then he's been seen circling the airport in the early mornings, trying to ticket those who were involved in the incident.  An incident in which he is said to be at fault, and one in which he received no special treatment nor mistreatment.

I wonder if there's any kind of complaint that can be filed without him calling the entire MPD down upon you for doing so?  As much as most of the island hates him, he probably has friends in the force, and if he's insecure and juvenile enough to retaliate that hard for simply being laughed at, it would not surprise me at all to see him take drastic measures in order to satisfy his petty sense of justice.

There was no police report, and the most I got from HPD when I called was that ""You probably just crashed."" 

I was apparently pretty crafty as I skillfully used my face to stop the rest of my body from getting hurt. I got a pretty severe concussion and lacerations.

-----

After eight months of closed crags, Hawaii climbers have only Senate Bill SB1168 to legalize climbing. The good news is that it's [successfully passed all of its committee hearings](http://openstates.org/hi/bills/2013%20Regular%20Session/SB1168/), and one of the only steps left is a full-floor senate vote, which could occur as early as ~~Friday.~~ *edit 2/28: It looks like the vote will be on Tuseday or Wednesday.*

As always, climbers need help! But not only that, bills like these help hikers and the entire state by protecting the government from frivolous lawsuits. Please take the time to sign [**THE PETITION**](https://www.change.org/petitions/hawaii-senate-pass-sb1168) to automatically email the relevant senators and help convince them to vote in support. We need them to realize how important this bill is, and flooding their inboxes is a good way of doing that. 

Additionally, you can also send a customized email to the same senators:

One day two of them stopped showing up...all three were pretty sick, so I think they died.  I felt pretty bad...so when the third one decided to come into the house we decided to try and save her.

A month later she is looking great.  We have two other cats and a dog, and she loves all three--especially our Shar Pei.  She uses the same bowls and litter boxes, so that is nice.

But--and this kills me--we just can't keep her.  I hate this.  She is easily my favorite animal in the house, but for personal reasons we can't part with my other two dingbat cats.  She is the only animal in the house that actively cuddles with me, and never hides under things...so I don't want to do this.

We have taken her to the vet, and she is going to get fixed next week.  Shots are done.

I cannot give here to the local SPCA.  They have a million cats and it breaks my heart to think she will sit in general population for months waiting for a new familiy.  She deserves better.  I will not take her to the Human Society.

So, I know Reddit is fond of there cats...does any Hawaii redditors want to add a super cool kitten to the family?  I would love to find someone who will keep her even if they move.  She has no interest in living outside either...she is also the only animal in the house that does not break for the door when it is open.

If interested please PM me.  We are happy to help pay for the first year of vet bills too.  There should not be many...the vet said she is healthy as a (tiny) moose.

A little about myself, I am 23 years old. I currently work as a tour guide at Pearl Harbor. I am a big fan of beer such as IPA's and pale ales. I like to play board games and love to throw down for v.s. fighting games. I have gone surfing a few times now and while I am still learning, I enjoy it very much. My life here so far can be best compared to Paul Rudd's role in ""I Love You, Man"" where I actively seek out friends, and don't really find any... I don't drive so unfortunately that is a down side to me but if you live anywhere near Mililani, or willing to meet up somewhere near there, that would be pretty rad.

I'm kind of shitty at writing about myself so if you wanna ask me questions or anything to make sure I'm not a psycho from the internet, please do so!

I'm in a very hard place in my life right now because I am experiencing loneliness like I have never felt before. I had many friends in my home town and so it's been a surprisingly hard adjustment going from that to being completely alone. "	t5_2qi3u	True

Time is from about noon to whenevs. I had thought we could go to Nocturna after, but someone reminded me that there is a dress code for guys, so I don't think that will work out. 

I can pick up 3 people, and I am sure there are others that can offer rides as well.

i went down to the pig pen on baretania to complain, and they said they didn't handle that. what? they didn't handle illegal vehicles on public streets?
so i went to some office on Richards street by the Hawaii State Art Museum. like the department of something or other. the guy there said he was just as irritated as me, and that these motorcycles are in fact illegal. but the HPD doesn't feel like enforcing the law on every single one they notice because ""they have better things to do."" 
but he did say that if i had a record of a ""persistent violator,"" i could expect the cops to show up eventually. right now it's just a case of HPD apathy. they don't want to enforce the law, and they have ""discretion"" in the matter. but if enough people make a big enough stink about it, HPD policy will have to change... or something.

TuntadunFilms	28	6	46	"I enjoyed movies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and 50 First Dates as much as the next guy but as a Native Hawaiian filmmaker, I've always yearned for real stories ""by the people for the people"".  At the same time, I completely understand film is a business which complicates things and makes it a bit of touchy subject creating a fine line to portray Hawai'i ""right"", whatever that means.  

On one hand, if Hawai'i is portrayed as the typical commercial island paradise, we go crazy like ""We're more than just surfing and hula skirts!!  Real stories need to be told!!""  At the same time, when Hawai'i is portrayed in a darker tone (which is more realistic to me being from Westside O'ahu), we hear ""What are you doing?!  This is Hawai'i!! This is paradise!!""

Seems like almost a lose-lose situation.  What do you guys think?  Obviously there are tons of stories that the rest of the world should/need to see and would make amazing films (reign of the monarchy, the overthrow of the Queen, Hawai'i going into martial law after WWII, just to name a few).  But as a filmmaker from Hawai'i, I want to make sure that I do good by Hawai'i and I do good for Hawai'i, so I just wanted to throw this question out there.  

How do you wish Hawai'i and her people was portrayed in the media (film, TV, etc.)?

I would love to meet up with some people if you are open. I travel there tomorrow and am in Honolulu for the next week or so doing various activities.

Additional: I already did my research on what to do but if anyone has any suggestions not covered or typically missed I would love to hear them.

The third and final developed outdoor area has been closed by the DLNR.	experiential	32	10	12	"**Update:** Please sign this [Change.org petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/governor-abercrombie-and-the-dlnr-re-open-access-for-climbers-to-climb-on-state-lands).

As of today, Moke Jungle and ""The Arch"" have been officially closed. Signs are being pounded into the trailheads, and DLNR rangers are no doubt out to intercept anyone attempting climbing. 

Here is the news release from Mike Richardson, owner of Climb Aloha: [\[Facebook.com\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ClimbAloha/permalink/10152311460415467/)

------------

**[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/153sxn/a_plea_to_help_save_climbing_in_hawaii_the_third/) from /r/climbing:**

The island of Oahu has three developed areas for sport and trad: Mokuleia, Makapu'u, and the Mokuleia Jungle Canyon. 

On June 11th 2012, a young girl with a group from the YMCA Camp Erdman was [critically injured](http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Mokuleia-climbing-wall-closed-after-falling-rock/cXxiqnK3h0ekVB3_48eTtg.cspx) by a falling rock at Mokuleia. The group was not wearing helmets, in violation of YMCA safety procedures. The day after, the area was closed by the state's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). 

In August, the DLNR [closed the Makapu'u crag](http://www.accessfund.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=tmL5KhNWLrH&amp;amp;amp;b=7903133&amp;amp;amp;ct=12116903&amp;amp;amp;notoc=1), a small area on the opposite corner of the island with little loose rock and no recorded history of injuries. 

Now, the DLNR is preparing to close the Mokuleia Jungle, a slot canyon not far from the Mokuleia wall. It is also preparing to forbid climbing on ""[The Arch](http://www.unrealhawaii.com/2011/04/the-arch/)"", a difficult bouldering spot west of Mokuleia. It's easy to imagine that bouldering may be outlawed outright. 

This is happening in a state where a person has drowned [roughly every single week.](http://hawaii.gov/health/healthy-lifestyles/injury-prevention/injuryinfo/drowningbrief.pdf)

There are not many climbers in Hawaii so support from the international climbing community would be greatly appreciated. This issue is relevant even if you don't live here. You may want to visit in the future, or you may just feel that climbing is a sport that all people should be able to enjoy. Furthermore, laws passed in Hawaii may be used as examples for other states.

The Access Fund has agreed to provide, at no cost to the state, one year of liability insurance for climbers while a more permanent deal is developed. The DLNR has rejected this proposal.

--------------------

If you would like to help, please take some time to contact a few people:

William J. Aila Jr., chairperson of the DLNR. Ask him why the DLNR has rejected the Access Fund proposal, and point out that you would be less inclined to visit the state if climbing is illegal, and that about 30 tourists (and 30 locals) drown each year, but no tourists have ever died climbing.

Saturday at Vit's, 8:00pm

It's located on the ground level of Maile Sky Court and I believe there are free pupu's. If not free, then 1/2 price due to the hour. 

Come one, come all!

EDIT: I just got back from talking with Vit, the owner, and he agreed to give us happy hour prices ALL night long, as well as starting their 1/2 price Pu Pu's an hour earlier. So we can get $3.95 Mai Tai's and $.50 off all beer and any liquor. Pu Pu's will start at $3-$6 and they're awesome! May not be the cheapest, but for a Saturday night and we have the entire bar area to ourselves, we should be good to go!!

I'll be traveling to Seattle, WA in mid-June for their awards ceremony where they will reveal which of the three books in my category will be the winner, taking home a $15,000 advance and publication!

In the meantime, fellow Hawai'i Redditors, I could use your help. Go to the [ABNA page](http://www.amazon.com/abna) and take a look at my excerpt, and then vote for my book, *A Chant of Love and Lamentation*.

The competition is pretty good so I can use all the help I can get. It's quick, it's free, and it would mean a lot to me. Spread the word! Thank you everyone for your support.

Here's the Publisher's Weekly Review:
&gt;This well-developed work imagines a Hawaii in the aftermath of an act of home-grown terrorism. Meaning to shed light on their cause, returning Hawaii to Hawaiians, the state’s secessionist movement takes the extreme tack of bombing a tourist hotel on Waikiki. The impacts, more far-reaching than the bomber had imagined, unfolds through the stories of three characters: Charlie, a mixed race cab driver who is convinced by members of the Warriors of Freedom to be the bomber; Jeff, a self-important real-estate agent whose life falls apart after the murder of his wife, Anna; and Daniel, the heir to the Hawaiian throne. After the bombing Charlie flees to the mountains where he faces the choice of living by his wits or dying. He isn’t around to see tourists staying away in droves, resulting in the collapse of the island’s economy. For Jeff, the loss of jobs and rising foreclosures have little impact; he has no interest in living. Daniel, who had been running from his heritage, returns home and is pulled into the “Hawaiian Islands, Hawaiian hands” movement, a group with money and political clout. The intertwining of stories is effective, providing a fully developed view of the consequences set in motion by the hotel bombing, and the narrative is cohesive, believable, and well worth a reader’s time.

Woodforsheep	25	2	14	"So, quickly, here's my bad situation.  I'm homeless right now because of pending civil legal issues.  However, I also still have to keep paying the 2500/mo. lease on my home.  This on top of lawyer's fees and court costs and basically, I don't have a lot of disposable income.

I have some friends letting me stay with them right now, but they move on the 31st of March, and I'll be living in my car again, which I don't really want to do.  It's a small crappy car.

What I'm looking for is someone that's looking for a roommate for a month that can't afford a whole lot.  I really just need a place to stay for April.  I can probably afford to give you about $400, but that's the limit of my budget.  I don't need anything fancy, just a place to sleep/shower/plug in my computer.  I work on Ford Island so if you're in the Pearl City/Aiea/Salt Lake area, even better, but I know beggars can't be choosers.

A little about me.  I'm military.  I'm a software engineer with a college degree.  I'm clean.  I'm quiet.  I don't smoke, but I don't mind smoking.  I like to cook and am happy to do that and other household chores.  I'm also handy, especially with plumbing/carpentry.  My only limitation is that I can't be around drugs in any way.  And just to clarify, I'm not a criminal/accused of any criminal activity and my legal issues are a civil matter.

If you have any interest in helping me out, PM me.  I can provide references, more information and am happy to meet you anywhere to talk.  Like I said, I'm just stuck in a really terrible situation right now, the likes of which I've never had to deal with before. 

This may be absolutely the wrong place for this, and if it is, I'm sorry, but I'm not having a lot of luck on craigslist or roommate/rental sites.

EDIT: UPDATE.  I found a place.  A nice lady that I work with is going out of town for a month and needs someone to house-sit, so I volunteered.  This is the first lucky break I've caught in a while.  Anyway, thanks for all the responses and for everyone who offered advice.  I really do appreciate it."	t5_2qi3u	True
1331349048.0	qptzp	Hello from the Hawaii Moderator	jasonskjonsby	26	5	23	"It has been about a year that I took over as the moderator of Reddit Hawaii. During the last year, we have gone from having around 300 Redditors to 1421 Redditors.  I am very happy with all the submissions and the Aloha that has been shared. Keep up the good work.  We have also gained fellow Hawaii Reddits:  r/Maui r/Kauai and r/universityofhawaii.  Some new ideas and updates to consider and giving feedback on:


*The FAQs are old so we can no longer add to them. I will soon start rolling out  new FAQs over the next few weeks on the same topics (Things to Do and places to eat) and a few new ones such as (I’m moving to Hawaii and need help) and (How is Hawaii different?/ What cultural differences will I experience here?) Feel free to consider giving me other ideas.


*Also I have gotten busy with things and haven’t always been on top of the spam filter/ Mod duties all the time. So I am looking for a few Redditors to join me as Moderators. I am looking for Redditors with experience and who are active on r/Hawaii.  It would also help, but not required, if you had some computer knowledge to help enhance the site.


*The spam filter is not perfect and if you have a story that doesn’t show up PM (private message) me promptly




*Finally, there have been a few recent cases of people being rude or cruel to other Redditors on r/Hawaii. The Aloha spirit should be our guide and we should all work to make this site positive. If you are feeling harassed please let me know. I don’t want to ban anyone but I will if it becomes necessary.  Also, the word “Hoale” can be seen by some as insulting. It is okay if we are using it as a cultural identifier when we are talking about cultural issues but it should not be used to insult someone else. I personally believe that we should try to limit the words use. Edit:Haole, although calling someone a Ho'Ale is offensive too.

*I have added a few new Moderators. I will see how it goes and add a few more in the future if all goes well.

i can't live here anymore and i don't have any other friends. she sabotages whatever friendships i try to develop, and my depression and alcoholism made me kind of an ass for a long time. so all my friends from high school aren't friends any more.

On Monday, February 27, 2012, a student reported to UH Manoa Campus Security that she believes she was given a drink containing a “date-rape drug” after being approached by two males she did not know.

The reported incident began at Hemenway Hall in Manoa Gardens/Balé about 6:00 p.m. on Friday, February 24.  After consuming the drink, the student said she has no memory of the rest of the night, awakening in an off-campus apartment with a person she didn’t know.

The student reported symptoms consistent with the ingestion of date-rape drug substances: a rapid onset of intoxication out of proportion to what alcohol has been consumed and reported memory loss.

There is an active investigation into this incident.

To protect yourself, Campus Security warns everyone not to leave drinks unattended and to be wary of accepting drinks from anyone you do not know well. It is recommended that, in drinking situations, to be with friends and to look out for each other. If you or your friends exhibit symptoms including dizziness and/or nausea, memory loss, and breathing or motion difficulties, get help.  If you are on campus, call Campus Security at 956-6911 or police at 911.

If you have any knowledge of this incident, or feel you may have been a victim of a date-rape drug, contact Campus Security at 956-6911, the Honolulu Police Department at 911 or the UH Mânoa Women’s Center at 956-8059.

archzinno is inviting the lot of us over to his fine establishment for a 4th of July (but not really on the 4th of July) get together. Lets get to the Details!

  * When: Sat, July 2nd. Start rolling in at ~4pm

  *  Who: Anyone that is not (!=) a serial killer

  *  Where: 
  *  What to Bring:  
*  Burgers  
*  Maui Onion chips and some gazillion layer dip (Looking at you  [riksin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/i6o7s/reddit_meetup/c21cdvm))
*  Beer
*  Booze
*  Sweet stuff (chocolate, lots of chocolate)
* Computer, if you want to get some game on

I will bring some Pizza! 

archzinno:

Okay so as you can see in the google maps pic, there are technically 2 houses at my address. Mine is the one that's closer to Moanalua Loop, and actually my garage is up there too. Now, there is enough room for some parking on Moanalua Loop next to the cliff for some cars, so you guys can park there, but parking on Kanuku st on the sides is fine too.
One thing the neighbor asked me when I first moved in was if anyone were to come over through the front of his house for me to escort you in, which I don't see as unreasonable considering you come right up his driveway. So if you do come in through the Kanuku St entrance, please just text me  and I will ""escort"" you. I will let him know that people are coming over as well and perhaps he won't really mind either way, but I don't like to piss neighbors off.
Anyways, I look forward to you all coming over, I hope I can get my house fairly clean so you can all destroy it in an hour. j/k
I've got 2 couches and an air matress, and if some couple comes and gets too drunk or something and wants to crash I don't mind them taking my bed (King). So if you don't have a plan on getting home or whatnot I don't mind people crashing, but I would suggest bringing at least a pillow if that's the case, because there would be no guarantee you'll get a soft spot.
As for entertainment, my house contains a Billiards table, Ping Pong table, and a dart board. At any time 2 of those 3 can be played safely (as in no one getting smacked in the face by a paddle or impaled by a dart.) Upstairs is a little tighter because thats where I spend most of my time, and I've got a 52in TV with every game system. So if you have a favorite party game or something, feel free to bring it. I also have a lanai I will put some chairs out on if anyone feels the need to smoke. Don't think I have an ash tray but solo cups will suffice I imagine.
Any other questions or grievances feel free to ask.
And thanks for picking a creepy pic. I feel like if I wasn't wearing sunglasses I may have had serial killer eyes.

A car comes through the wrong way on a one way, and tries to cut in front of my car, and the 6 or 7 cars behind me. we scoot up as a ""no way pal"" kinda move and they thrust in even further. I lower the window and shake my head like NO WAY and they almost hit our car going in MORE. At this point Im thinking they cant be SERIOUS. So I lower my window and they open the passenger door.

A guy [i could tell he was a local] gets off and starts telling me ""what the fuck"" I said ""SERIOUSLY MAN, YOU CANT CUT"" and he replies
""FUCK YOU. SIT THE FUCK BACK IN YOUR FUCKING CAR. NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK YOU, YOURE STUPID, GET THE FUCK AWAY, I WILL WHACK YOU RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW""

so im in AWE he was so aggressive. I say ""Really? Really. Okay well heres my phone, i just pressed record, youre gonna hit me? Go for it""

Im 5'5 hispanic female. I was in beach gear. Totally didnt deserve the aggression I got. As soon as i said ""Ill record"" he backed up immediately and got in the car with a few last obscenities about my appearance and they shoved their way in front of us in line. 

I was shaking with adrenaline, and i asked my roomate driving ""should i call the cops? he threatened to hit me"" and she said ""Im already calling""

I got off and snapped a pic of their lic plate, and after getting our meals, waited in the parkinglot for the police. They knew I called because of the picture and us waiting on the phone, so they waited too. 

The cop showed up and I got off our car to go talk to the officer, and he comes up running behind me. I started walking faster to the police car and tell the officer ""He threatened to hit me i dont want him anywhere near me""

The guy denied any threats, and now his gf comes out of nowhere and also says im lying. And that im ""fucking ugly"". Like it has any relevance? Anyway, the cop stood by while another cop arrives and takes over. The new officer was obviously local as well and asked me what was going on. I tried to explain and he interrupted to ask for my roomates ID. She gives it to him, and he says ""WHATS THIS? I DONT WANT THIS. I NEED YOUR DL, NOT THIS"". [It was her military ID.] She calmly states he asked for ID, shell retrieve her DL. 

His attitude IMMEDIATELY changed after seeing her military ID and my Texas ID. He spent all of maybe 5 min with me total, never hearing my entire story. He spent appx 20 min with the guy and his gf, both locals. He was smiling and laughing with them, while i was SHAKING with frustration and crying. As soon as he got to us, his smile disappeared.

I never felt so unfairly treated and discriminated against. I heard a lot of warnings about staying away from certain ""locals only"" parts of town and not to cross any ""locals"" because they hated mainlanders. But in Haleiwa? Really?

I was gravely disapointed in how it was handled. He wrote it up as a traffic violation [no one was hit and he did nto ticket her for driving incorrectly into a one way]. There is a ""harrassment"" option but he did not file my complaint under ""harassment"". I attempted to dispute this with him but he brished me off saying ""if i wasnt happy to call in 7 days and dispute it or whatever""

I have the entire conversation from police arrival to leaving recorded. [thanks iphone!]

I called a Sgt at Honolulu Police Dept and he said i can only file a complaint with polcie commission, and hes gravely sorry i had such a horrible experience. He empathized as his own wife apparently deals w a lot of discrimination too.

Is there anything else I can do? Is there anything i should keep in mind in the future?

It left such a bad taste in my mouth, and now I know why some people make the assumptions that they do. I wanted to love Hawaii, i really did. But this incident may leave me jaded. :("	t5_2qi3u	True

So I ask the redditors of /r/Hawaii, if you were putting together a collection of songs *that represent the islands to you*, what would be in there?

I'd love to hear absolutely any suggestions, for any reason!

Maybe you'd include historically significant songs by native Hawaiians like ""Aloha 'Oe"" and others written by Queen Liliʻuokalani. Maybe you'd include more modern Hawaiian music, like Iz's stuff including his epic arrangement of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" Maybe entire genres of music bring Hawaii to mind, like slack key guitar (seems like ""Sleepwalk"" always makes me think of a beach).

Perhaps you'd even include seemingly random pop songs or unique stuff that just has an anecdotal/personal significance to you and you relationship to the islands? I'm not ashamed to admit that every once in a while the sight of a volcano randomly reminds me of the horribly cheesy theme song to the (arguably awful) 1980s television special ""Garfield in Paradise.""

This Sunday, August 5th, let's go explore the GREAT OUTDOORS! We need guides! We need friends! If you're familiar with the trails around Oahu, leave your suggestions on this thread.

We'll meet in the guest parking lot at 350 Aoloa street, Kailua. Need a ride? Let us know! Got a ride? Let us know that, too! 

Rain or shine, let's do this! 

Edit: Pu'u Ma'eli'eli has been recommended as a decent beginner/moderate trail that should keep everyone interested. I figure if no one disagrees with it, we can all meet at the address above and then rendezvous at the movie theater parking lot near the start/end point. I want to start hiking around 9 am, so we can get back in time for lunch.

Also, if this gets to be a popular thing, i would like to do a different trail every time; and up the difficulty as everyone becomes more acclimated.

Edit 2: If you're interested in going, make sure you save this thread somehow. I don't want to litter our front page with updates and this post may be hard to find next weekend.

Edit 3: For those coming from town, if you guys carpool and already have a full car, just meet us in the parking lot at the base of Pu'u Ma'eli'eli (i think there's a dmv office there, too) at 9. We'll see you at the summit for a photo op ;)

**If you don't have a ride**, find your way over to Aoloa street, and we'll carpool. PM me if i need to pick you up on our way. I'll find you a ride one way or another. We're leaving Aoloa by 8:30am on Sunday.

Hey everyone!  Tomorrow is our meetup, and I'm totally stoked!  Just wanted to re-iterate a few key points of information:

* **DATE:** June 23rd
* **TIME:** Noon and onward
* **LOCATION:** [Magic Island, Ala Moana Beach Park](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=217374399201554733355.0004c29bdbf6440a1f918&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=21.288495,-157.848816&amp;spn=0.020173,0.033023) (click link for exact satellite link on Google Maps)
* **[Who's Bringing What](https://docs.google.com/a/kd5vmo.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am7ii02-bHuMdHdYMHNaWnBQUnR0c2ZQeWVRRW5NY1E#gid=0)**

First off, we have a few housekeeping things.

* Please note that while many of us support the right of everyone to enjoy their lifestyle however they please, **due to the location of the gathering and state law, we must request that this be a no trees and no alcohol event**.  I realize that a ton of you have signed up to bring alcohol, and may have already purchased it in anticipation of tomorrow's gathering; I do apologize profusely if this is the case, as we are still getting better at event planning.  We honestly cannot prevent you from making the choice to go ahead and bring it and keep it on the down low, but please realize that we are not held responsible for any fines, tickets, or other legal repercussions for doing so.  The same applies to trees.  TL;DR: If you must, be discreet.

* In note of the above, there may be after-gatherings that /are/ alcohol/trees friendly.  Please feel free to make arrangements in this or other posts for such gatherings, and we'll be glad to link to them.

* A LOT of people have signed up to bring things--our current count is hovering around ~33 +/-3.  As such, we would love it if anyone could also sign up to bring cups, plates, utensils (forks/knives/spoons), napkins, and trash bags.  Portable tables would also be appreciated.  Please edit the sign up list accordingly if you will bring these items.

* We also need more folks to bring foodstuffs.  If everyone shows, that's a lot of people to feed!  Drinks like juice/soda would also be awesome.

* If you have signed up to bring something, and can't make it/had a change of plans/hate kittens, please strike your name from the list so that we can keep a more accurate head count.

Thanks for reading, and we'll see you all tomorrow!

The denizens /r/Hawaii are here to help!  Many of us live here and are glad to share our Aloha with you, as well as our insider tips.

To make it easier to help you, help us by giving us some basic info.

1) Which island are you traveling to?  There are four major islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and 'Hawaii' AKA The Big Island) and two minor ones (Molokai and Lanai) that you can travel to.  Knowing which island(s) you plan to visit allows us to help you right away, rather than asking ""which island are you visiting?""

2) What kind of activities do you like?  Are you a night person?  Day time?  Early morning?  Do you like hiking?  Swimming?  Sipping a drink by the pool?  Knowing what you like helps us to suggest what to do.

3) Who are you traveling with?  If you're by yourself, awesome, we got the ideas for you.  If you're with family and children, there are different activities we can recommend for all of you.

I was swimming with some friends at Papailoa on the North Shore, when we saw a commotion about 25 yards away from us.  It took us a moment to realize that it was a person that was being pulled from the water, unconscious, by her companions and some other beachgoers.  They administered CPR until the paramedics came.  We ran out to the street to show the EMT's where to go.  They came and continued CPR, then tried defibrillating her, but her heartbeat never came back.  I'm still in a bit of shock about it all, I've seen people die in front of me before but never quite like that, where I felt sort of helpless - she was already getting the help she needed, there wasn't much more I could do - but it's still an awful feeling.  Her friends/family were crying right there on the beach and there was nothing anybody could do - their vacation/beach day turned into a living nightmare.  The paramedics and firemen covered her body with a white sheet and then left as the police took over.  A stark reminder that even nearly flat, calm seas can be deadly, and a reminder that life is short and fragile, so enjoy it and be good to each other.  Mahalo for reading.	t5_2qi3u	True

My friend found a day old nene goose getting eaten by a dog. He saved it, but after an exhaustive search couldn't find the mom. So he took it home where it imprinted on him. Meaning the baby gosling thought that my friend was her
mother. 

He kept it for two weeks but didn't  really know what to do with it as it would follow him everywhere. So he gave it to me. I raise ducks and chickens and have a big fenced in yard for them. So I raised the nene along with a batch of ducklings. (side bit of cuteness. The ducklings hatched the same day I got the two week old gosling. So, she was imprinted on tall white males and the ducklings ended up imprinting on their brooding goose
companion. So a line of us would walk through the yard; nene chasing me and the 6 ducklings chasing nene). 

I asked around about what to do with her.  Apparently the humane society works with DOFAW to return them to the wild, but they can't accept imprinted ones. Rumor was that if I turned her over to DLNR they would kill her. Neither of which I want to happen (as I've gotten close to this awesome goose that now thinks I'm its mother).  

My thought was that as long as I didn't keep her contained, that I wasn't really breaking the law. Keep in mind that nene geese are the rarest geese in the world. They are endangered and federally protected. So, it's been fine and she's now six months old. However, she's beginning to fly. Her safe half acre of fenced in lands (orchard with ponds) is surrounded by dogs (my own and neighbors). None of the dogs are particularly dangerous, but she has a bad habit of pecking at their eyes. 

So, here's the problem. If I let her fly out she's going to invariably get eaten by a dog. If I clip her wings, I'm sure that I'm violating all kinds of state and federal laws. If I turn her in, she'll probably be killed or kept in small confinement. 

What do I do? Please, any advice is appreciated. I really just want to do what's best for her and harbor no delusions of keeping an endangered animal as a pet.  

TL;DR I have a nene goose and am not sure what to do with her.

1368706830.0	1eg2yu	Has anyone signed up for HawaiianTel Fiber?	ardentto	21	3	56	"I use DirecTV (mainly for the NFL Package but the new Genie is pretty great) and Oceanic for ISP.

I am seriously considering switching to the new HawaiianTel Fiber option -- sales reps came through my neighborhood (last week) after they ran the fiber (last month).    Unfortunately, I can't get TV &amp; Internet if I want the 50Mbps down and 10Mbps up speeds.

I also noticed (from their website) that the 50/10 service is really 50/2 and you can upgrade to 5Mbps and 10Mbps Upload at some extra charge (cant find a price).

So my questions are:

1. Does anyone have the service?  If so, TV, Phone, Internet?

2. How is the picture quality, call quality?

3. How are the internet speeds, what speed are you rated for?

4. What is the '$5k worth of equipment' they will install in your home 
'free of charge?'

Any details will be of great benefit.  Thanks

**Update #1:**
Called Hawaiiantel, they'll give me 25/10 for $67.95/mo.  Their standard up is 3Mbps, and to go to 10Mbps is another $10/mo.    They also 'lost' my order, so I'm glad I called.

**Update #2:**
If you get a tv package, your max upload speed, currently, will be 1Mbps.  I'll be waiting for the new project that allows higher speeds and TV before I switch the TV packages.  Internet pricing (w/o bundle) is here: http://www.hawaiiantel.com/Residential/Internet/Overview/tabid/210/Default.aspx#sthash.rgSy8xhn.dpbs  then add $10 for 10Mbps upload."	t5_2qi3u	True

""Aloha Runners, 

We hope that your training and plans for the 2012 XTERRA Trail Run World Championship are going well. We are now a week away from the big event, and we are turning to you, our XTERRA Tribe, for some assistance. 

As many of you know, events of this magnitude would not be possible without the assistance of volunteers, and we are in need of some volunteer help on race day. This year's race is scheduled for Sunday, December 2, and we are expecting a record field of of more than 2,000 runners at Kualoa Ranch this year. 

Volunteer duties include packet pick-up assistance, aid stations (handing out Gatorade/water to the runners), course marshals (keeping runners on course), finish line assistance, timing help, and clean up. All volunteers will receive an event t-shirt and lunch, and the undying gratitude from the XTERRA staff and runners. 

The day would start around 7:30 a.m. and end around 1:30 p.m. (some duties would require an earlier start or later finish). If any of you have friends, family members or co-workers who might want to come out and help for the day, please send them along. Any potential volunteers can contact us for more information: 

dayton@xterraplanet.com via e-mail

I did an insane amount of hiking while I was there and I'd like to thank you guys for providing the FAQs in the sidebar that lead me to sites like UnrealHawaii.com which is a treasure trove of incredible hikes to go on. I hiked a bit before I went there but while on the island I absolutely fell in love with it and will probably start doing a lot more back on the mainland as well. I'll recommend some hikes that I did. Mariner's Ridge is a wonderful one to do with family or for people not in good shape, it's short and not difficult but results in a wonderful 360 degree view. If you're a bit more experienced then Olomana is an incredible time but I have to say take caution, you can easily get hurt very badly if you aren't careful here especially after the second peak. I did the Lanipo trail which I thought was great, it was fairly long and after the beginning part was pretty overgrown and there wasn't another soul on it. It has a pretty cool view of Kaau Crater as well. For a workout you really can't beat Koko Head. 

Another big thanks to you guys for your Places to eat FAQ. I have you guys to thank for checking out Teddy's and South Shore Grill both of which I thought were fantastic. 

I did, saw, and tasted so many awesome things while I was there that I know I won't soon forget this trip. Thanks for being such cool people in general and a ton for the information you guys put on this subreddit, it's appreciated. 

P.S: Anyone visiting or native who goes hiking or anything outdoors, if you see some trash or a bottle or something...pick it up and take it with you. I didn't see a whole lot of that but I tried to pick up what I could when I saw it, no one wants filthy trails. 

TL;DR: Thanks to this subreddit for being awesome and to the people of Hawaii for being nice. "	t5_2qi3u	True

This year give her something unique- Adopt a Nene in your mother's name. For your $30 donation to the Friends of Haleakala you receive adoption papers, information about your nene, an adoption certificate, and a nene postcard. Donate more and get a matted nene photograph and your mother's name displayed at Haleakala NP visitor center. All donations go directly to Haleakala National Park for conservation work.

The nene is Hawaii's state bird- a Canada goose that made the long journey out here and decided to chill out, lose some weight, and stay a while. The nene almost disappeared from the islands by the 1960s due to habitat loss, introduced predators, and hunting (it was on early menus at the Volcano house with an ohelo berry sauce!) A captive breeding program and intense predator control has brought the nene back from the brink of extinction. Now you will find them on Big Island, Maui, Molokai, and Kauai. They still require human intervention to survive. The adopt a nene program is one way that you can directly help the nene and the people who work hard to keep our state bird alive.

* We will have XBoxes, Game Cubes, and other games (Settlers of Catan, Munchkin., Ect...)

Fell free to call me at (919) 473-3348

From MegaMorty:

I'll supply as much as I can in terms of plastic utensils, plates, cups, etc. Somehow I don't have any coolers, do you? COLD BEER please!

I'd say to add yard games to the main post for stuff to do/bring. Like that plastic horseshoe game or something, theres a small area for something like that to be set up.

Just so we're not stuck in a house all day, if everyone is down we can head up to the park (2 min walk) and play some ultimate frisbee or idk kickball or something, there are a ton of baseball fields at the park.

Today we were snorkeling and noticed a snorkel operation encouraging damage to the reef we were at. I saw snorkelers picking up sea urchins and bringing them ashore, snorkelers breaking off coral, and generally destructive behavior to the reef and animals. I tried to discuss this with some of the snorkelers I could reach, but they told me that their guides told them it was okay to do this. This made me very angry, since the reef we were at was one of the nicest I've seen and in excellent shape. I was hoping someone who was local could point me towards an organization to whom I could report this. (I do plan to contact they snorkel company as well.) Thanks!

**Edit: I just got back to my room. Thank you all for your responses. I will try DLNR and the two websites posted. I don't want to give the company name since it is possible that the snorkelers were acting of their own accord (although I doubt it). But I would like to have it noted by some of these authorities.

So I want to start putting together a LAN Party, but I want to make sure that efforts will not be in vain... 

Things I need to know

 * Dates! what times are best and when... I am going to shoot for some time late next month (October 29th or 30th?) but I am open to ideas

 * Location... I have a few places with enough space for ~40 people, and 100 or more if it gets that big, all downtown, but there will be no tables, so that would need to be arranged. If you have a better place, please LMK.

 * Attendance: Who would be interested? Have any friends that would come? The more the better.

 * Games:! PC, Xbox (360), PS3, SNES and more... But we need some common games that we can all play (SC, Quake 3, Halo, WC3, BF:BC2...)

 * Equipment: I have bunches of 16/24 port 100Mb dumb Switches that we can use, and we I can whip cables together quickly. Power can be handled in due time. This leaves TV's, which I must say I am somewhat short on... I may be able to pull some projectors from a source, but I cant guarantee anything on that front. Servers may be a bit tricky if we need them, but I could pull some stuff together.

 * tournament? would we want to have a street fighter tourny? SC? Quake? Halo?

Type 1: The Gangster


Even though Type 1 comes from heavily gentrified areas like Kapolei or Mililani, he likes to believe that he is living in the center of a violent ghetto. Type 1 has some decent quality herb, but he pinches bags and will, typically, give less than what was paid for. It is this practice that causes people to use him as a “last resort” when all other contacts are unable to provide. 

Type 2: The Raver


Type 2 loves to dance to house music and party it up at small clubs in Chinatown. He doesn't like to smoke herb because he is concerned that the munchies he will eat afterward will cause him to gain weight. Type 2 encourages experimentation into hard drugs; he will share stories of wild nights when he was shaking his booty in nightclubs while high on E. He is very friendly, but sketchy sometimes. Mid-grade herb; sometimes low grade. He always packs the bags with a little extra though.


Type 3: Classic Stoner Guy


Type 3 is cool as fuck. He's got long hair, he listens to classic rock, he doesn't care about anything but women, weed, and AC/DC. Sometimes he's unreliable, but usually he pulls through with some herb that will knock your socks off. Type 3 is always low on funds so he usually asks for gas money and will ask for a bite of whatever you're eating, but it's worth it because he's reliable. 


Type 4: Surfer


Type 4 is from California. He moved to Hawaii from California for the waves. Type 4 and Type 3 would probably get along really well because they have very similar personalities. Type 4 is a hippy: he will talk about mother nature, he only eats organic stuff from Whole Foods, but will occasionally eat at Taco Bell. You can find him at the North Shore. All the ladies love him, and he is perma-baked; even when he's not high, he appears to be ostensibly. He has some of the best herb on the island.

1364784702.0	1bebc8	People of Hawaii: What do you wish visitors/tourists knew about Hawaii's people and culture, but usually don't?	Bedheady	26	11	37	"Context: My husband and I visited Hawaii for the first time in May/June 2012 for a work-related conference at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. We had a great time, but we know that our experience of Hawaii's culture and people was very one-dimensional and stereotypical. It made me rather uncomfortable, actually. Our country is also a big tourist destination and the image presented to attract visitors is problematic as well. I had some health issues to deal with before our trip, so wasn't able to do much research. Since June, I've been looking at newspapers, blogs, books and Reddit trying to learn more. I consider myself a settler ally to the Native peoples in my country and am approaching this with seriousness and respect. 

Thanks in advance! :)

TL;DR - Went to Hawaii last year, had a sanitized tourist experience which was enjoyable but one-dimensional. I am an settler ally in my country and am approaching this question with respect and an open mind. 

EDIT: Thanks so much for taking the time to share with me. You guys are awesome!! :) I'm relatively new to Reddit and didn't know what to expect. I'm doing my best to check in and respond, but between real life responsibilities, the time difference and the sorry fact that I'm still trying to figure out how Reddit works, I'm quite behind!

1338747121.0	uiu7s	Reminder: Tuesday Venus Transit Big Island Viewing Locations (repost)	KaneHau	19	3	2	"I posted this a few weeks ago, but thought I'd repost as the Venus Transit is this coming Tuesday.

On June 5th (2012) the transit of Venus across the sun will start at 12:10 PM and will end around 6:44 PM.

On the Big Island - free viewing is available as follows:

1. **[CFHT](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/)** - The Canada France Hawaii Telescope in Waimea will have solar telescopes and a sunspotter available to the public.

2. **[Imiloa](http://www.imiloahawaii.org/)** - The Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hilo will have solar telescope available for public viewing as well as showing NASA live streaming of the event.

3. **[KECK](http://www.keckobservatory.org/)** - The W.M. Keck Observatory will have solar telescopes for public viewing at their visitor center in Waimea, as well as a live video feed from Mauna Kea summit.

4. **[MKVIS](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/)** - The Mauna Kea Visitors Information Station (9,000 ft on Mauna Kea) will have solar telescopes available. They are also operating satellite sites around the Big Island at Pu'u Huluhulu on Saddle Road, the Natural Energy Lab of Hawai'i' in Kona, and in Kea'au across from the post office.

5. **Internet** You can also watch via the internet [here](http://transitofvenus.org) and [here](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/podcasting/nasaedge/index.html)

Many of the sites will also be giving away free solar viewing cards (Imiloa, Keck, MKVIS, Pu'u Huluhulu, Natural Energy Lab, and Kea'au).

You can learn how to build your own Solar Observer [here](http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/05/stars2.html)

As you may know, S. 968 was introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) on May 12, 2011. This measure would authorize the Attorney General (AG) or an intellectual property right owner harmed by an Internet site dedicated to infringing activities (ISDIA) to commence an action against a registrant of an ISDIA's domain name or an owner or operator of an ISDIA accessed through a domain name. In addition, the bill authorizes the AG to commence action against individuals associated with nondomestic domain names. Following the commencement of such an action, the court is allowed to issue a temporary restraining order or injunctions against the nondomestic domain name, registrants, or the owner or operator of an ISDIA. On May 26, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill to the full Senate where it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar.

I support the bill's intent of ensuring the protection of intellectual property. However, in doing so we must ensure that we do not hinder the free-flow of information or stifle innovation. Rest assured I will keep your concerns in mind should the Senate consider S. 968 or related legislation in the 112th Congress. Mahalo again for contacting me.

(It's impossible to get these realators to fill them out off island) Well now her roommates are being lame and won't let us stay with her. So now I am stuck moving to Hawaii with no place to stay. All of the hostels there require a round trip ticket in order to stay there. I have hit up Couchsurfing.org but because I just created the profile no one will take me seriously (understandably). So this is a call for help to the last community I know. 

My friend and me are looking for a couch/floor space/hell even a closet to crash at while we go full force on apartment searching. I already have a long list of places to go to via craigslist so the hard work is done (I continue to update that list each morining).

We are mainly interested in lounging on a beach and swimming/snorkeling, and of course, eating. It'd be nice to fit some light hiking in or a museum.  The question is, being that we'll probably return at some point, would you recommend just staying on Oahu or taking a connecting flight to Maui. For the later we would likely have to spend the last night in Honolulu to catch our return flight. I've read that Maui is the more popular snorkeling location. Any advice would be great.

I perhaps should add, we are in no way advanced swimmers/snorkelers so safety of the sites may be a factor as well.

Edit: Thanks for the friendly advice everyone, great subreddit. We decided to do 5 nights in Maui and 3 in Oahu (Honolulu).

However, I absolutely love this soundtrack, and I was just wondering if this is a fair representation of Hawaiian music? I'm familiar with John Cruz and the Ka'au Crater Boys (and Jack Johnson of course), and this soundtrack sounds like it is perhaps more of an older style of Hawaiian music?

It's so funny the stories regarding the waterproof camera found. Last Monday i was visiting the North Shore with some friends and we went swimming in Sharks Cove. We went in low-tide and when the high tide waves came in the cove quickly became very dangerous. I lost my camera (dropped it swimming to get my girlfriend) and im lucky to only walk away with a few cuts. 

The camera is a [Fujifilm Finepix](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51s8ffSQMYL._SL500_SS500_.jpg) and is yours to keep as my thank you if you come across the camera, I am only hoping to recover the photos that were taken. 

I was swimming in the north part of the cove, but im sure the camera could be anywhere, hopefully still within the walls of the cove. 

Anyway, any help you can give would be so greatly appreciated! Thanks!

This Sunday, September 2nd, let’s go explore the GREAT OUTDOORS! 

Need friends? So do we! Need a ride? Let us know! Got a ride? Let us know that, too! 

Maunawili Falls is a popular beginner trail with a nice waterfall and swimming hole at the top. Make sure you bring shoes that you won’t mind getting muddy or wet because this trail will likely be both. A swim suit is highly recommended if you want to take a dip at the waterfall. EVERYONE BRING WATER! 

Parking is going to be an issue at the trail head, so if you don’t have a full car, meet in the guest parking lot at 350 Aoloa Street, Kailua and we’ll carpool. 

Rain or shine, let’s do this!

Edit: Looks like we have plenty of drivers... Who's coming from where? I'm more concerned with our leeward folks; I can pick up people windward.

As far as the start time - How does 9 sound? So meet in Kailua around 8:30-8:45. That will put us back at the car around 1pm (depending on how long we screw around at the falls) - then lunch in Kailua?"	t5_2qi3u	True

By 7pm he still hadn't arrived back to the hotel, we sent a team by car to the trail, no sign at the head, by 8pm the cops are called, the helicopters are gearing up for their search. 

He walked in, safe but bruised and weary, at 9pm. Gave us all a scare but thank GOD (athiests can ignore that comment) he walked in. Safe, but had an entire squadron scared for his safety and his well being. 

Now, the boys are all downstairs enjoying a few drinks (celebrating?) and giving him shit for going solo and scaring everyone.

My girlfriend and I are moving there on March 20th (actually, she gets there first, then I'll be joining her later).

She's planning on volunteering on a few organic farms to get her feet wet and start looking for a solid place for us to live before I get there in April or May. We love North Shore and Honolulu, and personally I loved Hauula for it's laid back, inexpensive lifestyle, but we're pretty open to where we want to land on the island. I know if we landed near Kahuku I would go to the Superette every single day for the best poke I've ever tasted ;)

OK so I'm basically cool with living anywhere on the island except a tent city. I'm bringing my own job (internet based) and she has dark skin and almost looks like a local (Kama aina, right...?) so I don't think she'll have trouble getting a job or being treated ok, but I'm as white as the driven snow and I obviously don't look like I belong.

My goal is to be respectful of Hawaiian culture and feelings, and I don't want to take insult to being called a haole or even being treated with indifference or anger by those who don't know me.

Can you guys give me some suggestions for the way I should react when being treated like or called a haole? Oviously I am one but I just want to know the best way to react.

Also, what areas should we be looking to live in for people that are on a pretty tight budget?

I currently have a Clear 4G Mobile Hotspot.  It's small, portable, has unlimited data, and under most circumstances allows for reasonable bandwidth...it's fast enough to stream video with a not-overly-annoying amount of buffering.  The downside is that it costs $50/month, and I'd really like to rein in my budget.

So, has anyone out there had experience with DSL from Hawaiian Telcom or TW Oceanic that they care to share?  Hawaiian Telcom seems like the better deal for the money, but the reviews on Yelp for both internet service quality and customer service are horrible. But TW also seems to have terrible reviews as well.  I do understand that one's proximity to a DSL hub determines a lot about one's actual bandwidth (I live at the Ewa end of Waikiki, btw), but it seems like Hawaiian Telcom restricts your plan options based on that already.  So, for those of you that have (or have had) wired home internet from one of these companies, is it worth switching from a hotspot setup to save $20/month?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the feedback everybody!  I'm getting a lot of mixed messages on speed, reliability, and customer service, and I'm guessing that a lot of this depends on where you live.  I've actually been pretty happy with the Clear hotspot for my usage, but I'd a switch to wired internet to ease the strain on my wallet without sacrificing on performance.  I'm not sure if Oceanic (who sound like the winner in the popular opinion poll) have a plan that actually saves me any money, so DSL might be the answer even with the known issues that it sounds like I would face.

If anyone wants to join in or knows where the good trees are, let us know! 

Last week we picked a lady's coconut trees for her and made drinks.

I have a PrintrBot Jr. which I've been using for about a month, and I've got it pretty well dialed in with PLA.  Planning on upgrading to a bigger system in the next month or so.

1362957346.0	1a1r3o	Blood Drive TOMORROW 3/11 at Kapiolani Community College	plantsonfire	19	6	2	"Aloha, I am normally a lurker who just made an account recently, but I thought I'd mention the blood drive tomorrow at Kapiolani Community College. The address is 4303 Diamond Head Rd, Honolulu, HI 96816 located behind Diamond Head Crater and the bloodmobile will be stationed in the parking lot behind the Ohia cafeteria. First donors of the day arrive at 7:45 and they are taking donors until 1:45. The entire process takes about an hour, which includes the 5-8 minutes of actual blood transfer plus the screening beforehand and rest time after.

I debated whether or not to post this here but decided to when the rain came down heavy this morning. Last blood drive there were many no-shows of people who signed up to donate (about 70% no-show) and we think it was partly due to the rain that day. About 10% of our sign-ups for this coming drive tomorrow have already canceled in the last week so there are some spots open for walk-ins.

If you are over 110 lbs., feel well this weekend, haven't had any tattoos or piercings in the last year, and want to donate to a good cause then please come by! All pints of blood are received and processed at the Blood Bank of Hawaii to support the institutions all over the state that need them. Even if one redditor decides to show up I will feel that this is a successful post! If you would like to contribute but cannot tomorrow, there will be another blood drive in the same place on April 15th.

Mahalo for your kokua and any questions will be answered to the best of my ability! In that sense I will add this disclaimer: I am not a Blood Bank employee, only a volunteer for the cause.

EDIT: If you choose to come by the bloodmobile to donate, please bring a photo ID and drink plenty of water beforehand! Being hydrated makes it easier to locate the vein and eating breakfast helps you feel better throughout the process. We are in the process of baking dozens of cookies right now so please come to the Mahalo table by the bloodmobile for some chocolate cookies and Capri Sun as a thank you for coming by!"	t5_2qi3u	True

One of my friends is here for Christmas and I took him to Bellows for the beach two days ago (December 22nd). The currents were ridiculous and he was carrying his GoPro (and recording) as a wave crested *going out to sea from the beach* and knocked it out of his hand. We were just north of the lagoon/river area that separates the public side from the military side.

1346264203.0	z15gy	My parents are having issues with the landlord.  Any advice?  They live on Oahu.  Thanks in advance.	Killashard	17	4	15	From my moms FB: Can anyone recommend a good attorney who is experienced in landlord-tenant law? Our landlord has been harassing us for months, insisting we do things that are not required by our lease. Just two examples: (1) She says that we have to hire a professional to trim our trees annually, when actually the lease just says we have to keep them pruned, which we are doing on our own, and they look good. (2) She says that because our sprinkler system is broken (which we notified her about 2 1/2 weeks ago and it still isn't fixed), we have to get outside and water the grass with a hose. Oh, and BTW, she's the one who is violating Hawaii law because she lives on the mainland and doesn't have an on-island property manager, as required by state law! We are only halfway through a 3-year lease, and we just want her to please, please, please stop her nonsense... Oh, and for those who suggest we should just move -- it isn't quite that easy. We have almost 20,000 pounds (!) of household goods we would have to pay a company to move, we want to keep our youngest daughter in the local elementary school, and we have a large dog and a cat that a new landlord would have to approve.	t5_2qi3u	True

1344903568.0	y6a8a	Interesting Visualizations from Saturday's Electoral Polls	spyhi	15	1	1	"Jared Kurokawa, an analyst I greatly respect, posted some interesting visualizations from the weekend polls:

* First, [results from the Mayoral race](http://brchawaii.com/map.php/?r=1&amp;contest=154&amp;type=cayetano&amp;width=1600&amp;Height=900), broken down by which districts had a &gt;200 vote advantage for either candidate, and which districts had a +/- 200 vote difference for either candidate. Jared's read is that these are swing precincts. He also believes it's fair to say that Caldwell will probably get the lion's share of Carlisle's votes, given that rail seems to be the key election issue. For my part, I feel that this visualization definitely shows Oahu's ambivalence about the rail.

* Second, [Hawaii's voter turnout, by precinct](http://brchawaii.com/map.php/?r=1&amp;contest=2&amp;type=&amp;width=1600&amp;Height=900). I don't have any ready comment about it, but thought /r/Hawaii might find it interesting. What I would love to see, OTOH, is this same visualization with an overlay of average real estate prices per area...I don't know off-hand, but I think the results would be telling.

Anyway, You can see Jared's analysis in his own words on [his Google+](https://plus.google.com/107629881358377966552/posts). Cheers!"	t5_2qi3u	True

Meetup Planing!

On June 23rd is the ""Official Reddit Meetup Day.""

[lovinlife420 has suggested Bellows](http://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/u6hck/june_23rd_is_global_reddit_meetup_day_lets_get/). 

 * Food: I generally think that a picnic/BBQ is best and the event should be alcohol friendly. 

 * Activities: Frisbe was fun, but I am sure there is more we can do

 * Time: I was thinking of starting at 2pm -3pm and letting it roll as long as it needs to.

 * AfterParty: [Nocturna anyone](https://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=nocturna&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=nocturna&amp;hnear=0x7c00183b8cc3464d:0x4b28f55ff3a7976c,Honolulu,+HI&amp;cid=8730243070340445265)?

I'm not advocating any hostile reactions toward this organization/brand. However, I do feel we (atheist/agnostics) also have a right to be proud of our religious views. So I think we can come up with a counter sticker.

I'll definitely turn this into a sticker and put this on my car, but can you guys come up with a better counter sticker for HE&gt;I?

- Bring cash. It's $21 per person not including 4% tax and 21% tip.

- We have a 2 hour window to enjoy the space.

- I will be there at 6:15 to 6:40 pm to give a heads up on the time change to any redditor who did not read my many threads. After that, I'll tell the front desk to let any redditor know about the time change. 

- I am not bringing wine. To quench the thirst of an estimated party of 25, I would need to bring at least 5 bottles and there is a $15 bottling fee. Utilize the unlimited soft drinks, coffee, and tea.

- I'll try to be there by 7:15 pm to greet any fellow redditors. I'll have a sign and a fedora hat with a Mario on the side of it. I'll also be wearing a blue shirt. 

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. It's a busy day at work, but I'll try my best to keep up with you guys.

Now then -- R/HAWAII UNITE!

Just spoke to Obiwan-VinegarStrokes over the phone for advice on how to handle this thing. He said that I should pull a boss move, pick the menu and move on. I told him that I'm trying to do the Obama thing and meet people half way. After much deliberation, I've decided to just pick the two cheapest menus and have you guys vote between the two. If there is no real decision, I will pick a menu.

- [The Firenze](http://i.imgur.com/3X25n.png) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)
- [The Sicilia](http://i.imgur.com/2Knfe.jpg) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)

I'm still leaning towards ""The Firenze"" as it has salad for the vegetarians, chicken parmigiana for the avian haters, and chocolate cake for the diabetes supporters. Plus, I don't have to get into a discussion about what to choose, unlike the Sicilia where you have to choose from each set.

~~THE IMPORTANT STUFF~~

~~Just spoke to Kalei from Buca di Beppo. For a party this large, they cannot offer the regular menu. We need to choose from a banquet menu and let her know by tomorrow (09/09/11) at 10:00 am as she's going to have a meeting with the head chef about our party. She gave me additional menus, so here are our options.~~

- ~~[The Classico](http://i.imgur.com/hhMQ3.jpg) - $25.95 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~
- ~~[The Milano](http://i.imgur.com/SXUTU.png) - $23.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~
- ~~[The Firenze](http://i.imgur.com/3X25n.png) - $21.00 per person (not including tax and 21% tip)~~

~~Here's the thing: I haven't been getting that many responses. I've PM'd people individually, but only got a handful of replies (and to those who did reply, thank you SO much.) To be completely honest with you, I'm not expecting a lot of people to give me their choice, PLUS come to an agreement on what they'd like to eat from the menu by 9:55 am tomorrow.~~

~~**So, if a miracle doesn't show up by next morning, I'm picking THE FIRENZE.** It's the cheapest possible option and I'm hoping that everyone will be okay with this. If not, I'm prepared for the bashing and real-life down votes. ~~

~~LET ME REPEAT THIS IF YOU'RE SKIMMING: I'm ordering Firenze if there is a) No real decision among all of us or b) There is no decision at all.~~

~~Please let me know as soon as you can. Mahalo, guys!~~

THE UNIMPORTANT STUFF

I just want to say something real quick: I know I’ve been thread bombing and I’m sure it’s annoying. The reason why I keep posting threads is that once people see facts, they don’t tend to look back at the original post and check comments. I want to make sure that every single redditor who is coming to this thing is in the know of what is happening. I do not want one single redditor who RSVP’d to show and not have anyone there. I also don’t want anyone to not have an option. As I said to smootie, **NO REDDITOR LEFT BEHIND.** 

If it seems unorganized, it’s because it is. I was not expecting this many people. I'm honestly doing the best that I can.
