How do you manage your collection? Is there any cloud platforms available?


Requirements I have in mind:

* Centralised (Every dataset managed in one place)
* Cloud based datastore (doesn't take up my HDD space, redundancy)
* Simple analysis/visualization workflow (I don't want to spend 15 minutes setting up a server connection when I feel the urge to tinker with a particular dataset)

I've been looking at the new scraperWiki, Google fusion table, some online DBaaS, but can't decide on one. Does anyone face the same problem as me? What are your experiences? Should I just stick to using SQL Server?

1307742488.0	hwpu0	Any interest in a data dump of all E3-related news stories from about a hundred gaming websites?	wierdaaron	16	3	5	"I run a website called [E3Feed](http://e3feed.com) that pulls data from a ton of different online gaming/news websites and filters out only E3 related stories for E3 week (which just ended).

Because of that, I have a database of every E3 related story (with timestamps and, in most cases, the body of the whole story). I also have an anonymous record of all searches performed by users of E3Feed.

I figure this data might be interesting to someone capable of analyzing it. You could probably do something like see what times certain types of stories are posted, or what news source was most likely to break a story first, or maybe even what news sources used the exact same wording for a certain story (meaning they either cribbed eachother or just reposted a press release).

Would any of you like such a dataset? If more than one person is interested, I can provide files in any format desired (XML, CSV, etc).

**EDIT**: Here you go:

[E3Feed Data Dump](http://c1277.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/e3feed_data_dump.zip) (4.1MB zipped)

Contains: 

**E3Feed Stories (XML and CSV)**

-Fields: id, timestamp, headline, source_name, link, body

-Notes: 

* ""link"" is most likely non-canonical. URLs in RSS feeds tend to go through a click tracker or shortener. I try to resolve those to true links but there still appears to be a lot of RSSified urls. 

* Also, attempts are made to normalize all timestamps to the same time zone based on the offset between each RSS feed's timestamp and E3Feed's native time zone (central). Don't put too much weight on the timestamp's accuracy without seeing if there is a consistent bias for a given source.

* In cases where the article's body isn't included in the RSS feed, my system attempts to scrape the body text from the source URL. This occasionally results in bad scrapes.

**E3Feed Searches (XML, CSV)**

-Fields: id, timestamp, search term

-Notes: 

* For sake of anonymizing this data, no identifying data is included. If (for some reason) you'd like to do some kind of analysis that requires associating searches with people (to find behavioral trends or something), I can provide you with a copy that includes some kind of anonymized identifier for the user.

*License stuff:* In using this data, please keep in mind that the content of the story feed most likely belongs to the originating sources (the websites that published the stories). If you create any derrivative work with this data, please note this and please credit E3Feed (with the url E3Feed.com).

Thanks for reading ahead of time! I am interested in finding data on the frequency at which various over the counter pharmaceuticals are sold in stores like CVS, Walgreens &amp; Safeway. 

I am attempting to answer some of the following questions:

Where are various products being sold around the country and at what frequency? (eg. In which states/regions are products for headache/migraines sold in greatest frequency?)

Where are my company's products being sold? Which products are being sold the most in any given region/state?

What is the frequency of sales for competing OTC products made by other companies? (By region if possible)

I am attempting to draw conclusions in order to design a product launch schedule/plan for the company at which I am currently employed. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Please offer additional suggestions if you think I am asking the wrong questions with respect to my stated goal.

Thanks again!
Sincerely,

This is for myself, I just thought it would be interesting to track over several months. 

Being that the peak flow meter measurement and timestamp of my medicine intake are numbers, it should be easy to graph and record. The other variables might not, perhaps I could assign numbers to sickness and cats? Is Excel what I should be using right now?

I have a great dataset already for some of the economic indicators, however except for the 2000 and 2010 census data my data on demographics is lacking.

I wanted to know if there are any reasonably good datasets at hand that can give me more finely grained data for 2011 and maybe some estimation for 2012 that show the demographic and ethnic makeup of states. I know the best data for that in general is the census data, however the frequency is far too low to get a good picture of the impact in 2011 and 2012.

If there is any interest I can promise to show you the endresult of my analysis in exchange for tips, but don't expect it for a few months. (latest in february).

[Here are some notes](http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2010/usernotes.html) from the US Census Bureau.

Consider an example of Moffat County, CO (The School District is the same as the county for this case)  [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=area+moffat+county%2C+co) says the area is 4751 square miles. The data from the shapefile says the area for that district is 1,494,753,340 (no units specified).

I know I could just use a conversion factor, but for the paper I am working on, as well as for the sake of robustness, I would like to know what the units of measure from the shapefiles is. (Edit: The conversion factor would only work if its a linear relationship)

Thanks!

**tl;dr** The US Census could make their data a bit more user friendly.

I want:

""List of countries by English speaking internet users""

---

Reason for the data? Countries have borders. But the internet is an international phenomenon. The main borders are language borders, with crossings in multi-lingual people, and tourists in internet translators.

It's pretty clear based on the data I do have access to (above data separately), that English Speaking Americans are the majority of internet users. They have over twice as many English speakers as second place India, and over twice as many internet users regardless of language.

This shows that the United States has the largest influence on the English speaking internet (obvious to most).

And this is the goal, looking at the influence different countries have on the English Internet.

India, it has the second highest amount of English speakers, and fourth highest on the amount of Internet users (hold your jokes please). Though the majority of their English speakers have it as an additional language, so that's probably why we see more British influence on the internet than Indian.

I'm looking for other interesting datasets of dynamic phenomenon for primary school students, like, for example, datasets of biological and physical systems close to the world view of primary school students. Without success I've been looking for datasets of growing plants (with different variables like temperature, water, CO2, ...), real populations of animals (and other creatures), seasonal thermal energy storage, energy of the sun throughout the year, and so on.

For many of those examples I can find models (and generate data from that), but I want real, authentic, and messy data so students can explore a realistic situation and try to fit a model themselves.

1318275293.0	l7e9s	Is it legal to datamine an entire website?	ponchedeburro	1	1	1	"Hi,

I found this website containing which music was played on the given radio station a given date and time internal in hours (i.e 1-2 PM, 2-3 PM and ...). I would like to download and analyze this data, however I am considering the legality of mining the site. It has data from now back to January 2010. So that's 24*(days from January 2010 till now) queries to the server from my computer alone. 

I have two cases in mind. 1) Is it legal for me to datamine a website in that way and 2) could me querying the server that many time be considered spam and therefore maybe harmful? 

Thanks"	t5_2r97t	True

I'm taking a time series course and have had trouble finding interesting data that hasn't been analyzed to death. I was hoping you could help me find an interesting data set :). I wouldn't ask if I hadn't looked for a really long time without finding something interesting.


Here are some of my criteria:

- Nothing from an R package
- Not really anything finance
- A description of how the data was collected
- At least around 200 data points, hopefully sampled at equal intervals

Here are some of the things I would ideally like/or am interested in:

- Public health questions (surveillance, which unfortunately the CDC doesn't do flu surveillance year round)
- Perhaps data from California, since that's where I'm from
- Computational biology (unfortunately these are usually short time series)

If it helps, I plan to use classical techniques which were taught in the course (ARIMA, state space models, spectral analysis, etc.)

Thanks!

tl;dr looking for some time series data for a project."	t5_2r97t	True

Basically I need to collect and/or represent (I'm a graphic design student) a database. I'm not sure if I'm using the right technical terms but what I need is, instead of the averages (for instance, every second x people die in the world), I need an example of the collection of that sort of data (x people died in second  1, x people died in second 2 etc etc). Is there any website with this kind of information so I can take a look at it and, either use that to represent that on an info-graphic or use that as an example to collect some data myself? Any help would be appreciated.	t5_2r97t	True
