Also, sorry for the wall of text.

---------

To begin, we would like to thank all of you for participating in /r/yoga and helping it grow as a community.  The many insightful, kind, and inspiring posts that are found here are a bright spot in the Reddit universe.

-------------

**Rule 1 Reminder**

Over the past few weeks, the other mods and I have noticed a significant increase in the number of posts talking about whether or not ‘yoga selfies’ are appropriate for this subreddit. With that has come an increase in the number of negative and hurtful comments towards users whole beliefs lie on the opposite side of the debate.  I would like to remind everyone of rule 1 on the sidebar: 

&gt; Play nice. This is a community of people that share an interest in yoga. It is meant to be a safe and accepting place that is free of judgement. Let's all try to keep it classy, not lower ourselves to insults or rude comments, and make r/yoga an inviting place to visit.

**as of now this rule will be much more strictly enforced than it has been in the past**.  We are not trying to hamper discussion and debate on yoga topics, but attacking comments will not be tolerated and will be subject to deletion and the users posting them subject to a ban from /r/yoga.  We do not like having to heavily police the discussion threads so please keep things civil. If you see a violation, please use the report button to bring it to mod attention.

-----

**Yoga Selfies**

**The official moderator position on ‘selfies’ is that they will remain a part of this subreddit.** I went back through the last month of posts to the sub and found (approximately) 40-45 ‘selfies’ out of 350 posts.  This is right around 15% of the posts to the subreddit and they garner a [majority of all upvotes] (http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all).  However, these ‘selfies’ also come in bursts with time lags between the surges.  It is during these bursts that we see the most posts about the discontinuation of ‘selfies’.

--------

**New Rule 4: Testing a compromise**

In an effort to make a compromise, for the next two weeks /r/yoga will be introducing a 4th rule for the subreddit.  **Effective immediately, ‘yoga selfies’ must be tagged with [COMP] at the beginning of the thread title** (standing for Check Out My Pose).  Images of people practicing asana without this tag will be deleted.  This gives those users who want to see less of these posts the ability to use [Reddit Enhancement Suite] (http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) to filter out all of these images (described in my comment below), and it only adds a few extra keystrokes for everyone else. At the end of these two weeks we will have a community discussion about the rule and what all the users think.  The mods do reserve the right to go against popular opinion.

------

**A note on ‘real yoga’**

There has been quite a lot of debate as to the definition of yoga on the sub recently and how that pertains to what is appropriate for posting here.  Reddit uses upvotes and downvotes for a reason, upvote the content you want to see and downvote what you don’t.  **At this point, the moderators will not be deciding for the community what is and is not OK for posting on this subreddit.** We do believe that this can be a place for discussion of all creeds and aspects of yoga without being detrimental to any of them.  /u/bluescreenlife provided me with an [insightful post from Gov. Schwarzenegger] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1i2w2z/best_damn_cardio_humanly_possible_in_15_minutes/cb0ky70) about similar issues in /r/fitness:

&gt; Everybody, behave and stop bickering. This is about inspiring more people to get into ~~fitness~~  *(yoga)*. I've never understood people who argue constantly about who is wrong and who is right in ~~fitness~~ *(yoga)*, because the fact is, there are many ""right"" answers, especially for people just starting out. (...)

&gt;Do me a favor. Try to focus more on expanding the ~~fitness~~*(yoga)* community as a whole than protecting your little corner of it.

-------

**Seeking regular content generators**

Finally, I have received messages about adding several more “of the week threads.” Unfortunately I am at my bandwidth when it comes to generating content with my [Asana of the Week] (http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/aow) posts.  I would love to help any of you with Mod support for ideas that you may have.  In fact, /u/litchick has just started a [**/r/yoga book club**] (http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1g9tii/announcing_the_ryoga_book_club/) with discussions about a different book every month.  People have approached me about doing weekly threads on mindfulness, sutras, the limbs, and ‘yogic’ lifestyle.  If one of you, or a group of you, want to take the lead any of these or something else, please send me a PM or leave a note about it in the comments.

-----

Thanks to all of you for being awesome and giving this a read.

Namaste.

It probably came as a surprise to many of my friends because I fall closer to the hard drinking / hard living / motorcycle riding end of the yogi spectrum than the stereotypical practitioner might. 

Anyway, I write this update about how yoga has made me a calmer, nicer fella, and gotten me back in a little better shape at the same time. Six months later I find out that my dad was inspired to give it a go. Now, a year later, I just found out that my 70 year old father goes to class 5x a week and absolutely loves it. Being who I am, I've definitely taken some shit from some friends for my yoga practice, but I'm so glad I made that public proclamation! Share your passions people!

I'm Fiji McAlpine, here with David Procyshyn, the founder of **DoYogaWithMe.com**. We're super excited to be here on /r/yoga. Thank you all so much for the many mentions and recommendations you've given us over the past year. **We'll be online from 10-11am Pacific Time (that's 1pm in New York) on Wednesday, July 31st, to answer your yoga questions.** We'll also follow up later with any additional questions you have, so don't worry if you miss the live time slot. 

As many of you already know, DoYogaWithMe.com is a free online yoga video site. All of our HD videos are available to stream free in their entirety. I've been teaching classes and workshops for the last 11 years in California, Costa Rica and British Columbia. I started creating online classes with DoYogaWithMe.com about 5 years ago. It's been amazing having the opportunity to reach out online to those I haven't met in person yet. We've all been deeply moved by the hundreds of grateful emails and comments we've received from our online students, especially those from people who love yoga but who struggle to pay for classes. I'm so fortunate to be able to connect with so many - it inspires me to get back on that mat and film more to share with the world!

**EDIT**: Okay, that's all the time we have for now. We'll try to respond to more comments later on today. Thank you so much for participating!! This was a lot of fun for us.  http://imgur.com/Nv8Yz2m

She had designated a sub for the class, but the girl never showed up. Locked out of the studio in the pouring rain, everyone was positively itching to practice, and we needed a solution. Through the magic of democracy, and although I did not volunteer, I got elected as the instructor. I'm currently about halfway through a very drawn out teacher training (my trainer has opted to go on sabbatical during my training), so I was certainly expecting it to be a long while before I played the role of teacher. 

I did it, though, and I just wanted to share that with you all as I've been absolutely giddy with delight ever since and have not had anyone with whom I could discuss it. I've never been an awfully confident person, but I learned a new side of myself yesterday.

"	Lucas_Steinwalker	198	20	34	"Yoga is not about achieving the final result of getting into a posture. It is about practicing to find the edge of your physical limitations and ever so slightly nudge yourself over that edge. It is about learning to love who you are right now and become sensitive to, excited and strengthened by the smallest of changes in flexibility and the reawakening of the dormant parts of your body.  Take it slow. Love yourself and focus on now not the end result.  

No offense to those who have posted about their success in achieving advanced postures.  I'm not trying to diminish your achievements or imply that you didn't have to learn these same lessons, just lookin out for my peoples.

I commit to doing one sun salutation a day. The first time I had to make this commitment was when I graduated college and moved to another state for a demanding internship. I kind of forgot to pay attention to my body. The second time I made this commitment was when my now-husband and I moved in together. We both got kind of soft and squeezable.

The thing I like about this commitment is it gets boring, really fast. It's TOO easy. So my practice naturally grows.

Our son turned a month old yesterday and I have committed to doing one a day again. I'm 50 lbs overweight and recovering from a c section. I have never felt so shitty in my life. Yesterday it was the HARDEST single sun salutation I've ever done. But today was much easier :) looking forward to tomorrow

I was due. It was a little embarrassing to not be able to do some of the poses or not be able to hold them as long as I should. I remember being somewhat in shape once, and my body isn't understanding that this is no longer the case.

It went pretty well. I am blessed with natural flexibility despite my size, so that helped. My biggest issue was balance, but as I get in shape I expect that to get better. One thing I was not expecting was how sore my feet got from trying to keep my balance. I also had some issues with not being able to fully complete some poses because my belly was blocking me. Not an empowering experience,  but hopefully I will slim down as I do this.

I got some ""is this guy kidding me"" looks, which is fair. I imagine I looked pretty silly. The instructor was very welcoming though. 

I'm not sure what my point of this post was. I'm just pleasantly sore and glad to be doing something to help myself. I will be going back tomorrow for sure, and I hope to train myself to have this be a normal part of my life.  If you see a fatty in your class looking goofy, be nice.

EDIT: Thanks for the support and advice everyone! I went back today and it was a little better. My feet didn't hurt quite as badly, I was able to focus more on technique instead of survival. My balance is bad though, I am really anticipating seeing improvements there, I think it will make all the difference. Thanks for the kind words!"	t5_2qhq6	True

Next, I posted this as a comment before, but felt that it should be posted on its own stemming from all the infighting I've seen in the sub recently. So here goes.

Definitions evolve. They always have and they always will, thats part of human nature. I believe there are two major definitions to yoga. One is the more spiritual practice with more Eastern philosophical influences that was more popular a few decades ago and is still more popular in southeast Asia; the other definition is the more westernized version of yoga that relies on the physical aspects of the practice. 

The best analogy I have for this is food. Take noodles. Noodles have existed and continue to exist in many different societies across the world. Its a type of unleavened dough, rolled out, cut, and dried in to many shapes. The noodles can be made from different things, cut into thousands of shapes and sizes, called many different things, and prepared a countless number of ways.

Some people like hearty thick noodles that feel like they stick to your bones and feed your soul. Some people enjoy the lighter noodles that rest easily in the stomach and make you feel good. Other people even enjoy noodles that make you work hard to eat them because they taste so good and are good for you. But you know what every one of those noodles does? They nourish you. People enjoy different types of noodles for different reasons but they are all getting you to that end goal of fullness. Hell, even share your favorite noodle recipes with your friends. Eat whatever type of noodle you want, when you want it, because you like it, and it will make you better for it.

Yoga is different things to different people. I get so stressed when people on this sub say ""YOGA IS THIS"" or ""YOGA IS THAT,"" when it doesn't really matter. Do your type of yoga because it is what is good for you. Encourage people to try ""your version"" of yoga, and then try ""their version"" in return. You might learn something new.

**TL;DR Yoga is a noodle.**"	t5_2qhq6	True

Firstly, I felt like a bit of a sore thumb as I was the only male in the class. On the way in, a muscle bound monkey behind the desk pointed me in the right direction by saying ""the yoga class is where all the girls are lined up"" - with a snide undertone. I had just cycled to the class, so I was too out of breath to respond.

The entire experience is what I would imagine a girl walking into a rugby club would be like. It was like a complete sex role reversal. As I was leaving, some of the girls where going out of the door and naturally, without thinking, I invited them to go first - instead, they offered me to go first - like some kind of reverse 1950's chivalry. I went first out of the door. 

... now I'm a mid twenty's male, there are some mid-twenties females, some of whom were really quiet attractive, so when I got home my male house mates asked the natural question - some of them being aware of r/yogapants. Whilst I noticed the ladies in the room, I didn't want to be ""that guy"" and 5 minutes into it, I was focusing on my breathing so much I hardly noticed. I did get hit on by a cougar before the class though. All in all, regardless of sexuality, everyone was there for the same thing.

All in all, if there are any guys reading this thinking whether or not to go to a class - or if as my house mate worried about, ""maybe its a bit feminine"" - DO IT - it'll be fun and if nothing else, an experience. 

It was great, cycling afterwards was lovely as I was really warmed up and I'm going to be going again! "	t5_2qhq6	True

Recently, rye131 proposed having a pose of the week and I think it's a great idea.  So, starting on Monday I'll be posting the 'Pose of the Week' every week with links to videos or pages explaining the pose.  

The hope is to start a discussion about the pose so we can all learn from each other and improve our respective practices. Even simple poses can create interesting discussions and if nothing else it may help you be a bit more present in that pose that week.

I invite you all to share any variations you know or use for the pose, any tips you have and/or any benefits you feel the pose has had for you.  Really, anything you want to say about the pose is welcome.

I know some of you like to post pictures so please feel free to share a pic of you in the pose, or a video doing it.

The pose of the week will always be in the sidebar for easy access and I will compile a list of all previous weeks' discussions.

If you have any ideas on how to make our new pose of the week better please do comment here.  Also, I welcome your suggestions for poses of the week, just PM your idea and I'll add it to the list.

Thanks"	t5_2qhq6	True
1371479212.0	1gilyx	I am the new/inexperienced/dangerous yoga teacher that everyone talks about.	itsbecky	120	7	34	"I spent $3000 for a 3 month Yoga Teacher Training. I'll be honest, no experience was necessary. No application process. Paid the money and poof! Certified Yoga Teacher! I was a dancer, gymnast, and national championship cheerleader. Fresh out of training, I still felt like I had no idea what I was doing. My teacher would tell me you just mistake your way thru it. I didn't know much about sequencing other than sun salutations, standing poses, seated poses, and closing poses. But here's the thing: just like practicing yoga, you have to stick with it! 

The first 100 classes felt scary, nerve racking, dangerous, what was I supposed to do with a lady 6 months pregnant who had never done yoga before in a multi level class?! We didn't cover specific special cases like man with only one leg. Every body is different and has all these expectations. After teaching 200 classes, more workshops, and another 6 months of my own 6 day a week Ashtanga practice, I started to feel ok. I had seen a fair amount of bodies and could identify muscles located on other people's bodies as opposed to just seeing them in a book. After 400 taught classes, I felt like I had developed a style. I realized that I had been practicing yoga for almost 10 years and teaching for two. Someone once told me you have to have an ego before you can get rid of it. I had cycled thru *holy shit I have no idea what I'm doing* -to- *oh maybe I know what I'm doing* -to- *nope still don't know what i'm doing* -to- *I need more training* -to- *at least I know this is dangerous.* 

No one just *POOFS* amazing yoga teacher, you have to practice teaching. You have to stick with it. You have to use a beginner's mind, be open, and be humble, just like when you practice on the mat. First, do no harm.

There are still negative nancys, some yoga studios just don't fit, some are a great fit. We are all so different and that's what is great. Find the space that fits. Practice persistence, don't practice quitting. If you want to be a yoga teacher, go for it! but realize it is a long path and the first few years will be difficult because you will be that new/inexperience/dangerous yoga teacher. Just like when you try a new pose, it will be hard; but when you keep at it, it will feel amazing. 

Once I realized I was the new/inexperienced/dangerous yoga teacher, I knew what I had to do to become a great yoga teacher. That realization gave me somewhere to go. My journey is long from being over. I don't make a lot of money, but I get to do what I love and I hope I can bring love out in other people. "	t5_2qhq6	True

I tried to go in with little expectations or preconceived notions but the first thing that struck me was how the class flowed into and out of positions. I have very poor flexibility and my strength isn't great. What a workout...I was sweating profusely by 10 minutes into the class!

What I really hoped to gain, and what I found, was a great inner calm derived from the practice. At the end of the class we all layed down. The instructor came over, opened my ankles so they were facing up and came over and touched my forehead. This just gave me a total brain orgasm. All my stress and self-analyzing thoughts just blasted away.

**AMA from the folks at Doyogawithme.com**

First, we are please to announce that we are going to be having our second community AMA! The AMA will be from [David Procyshyn] (http://www.doyogawithme.com/users/david-procyshyn) and [Fiji McAlpine] (http://www.doyogawithme.com/users/fiji-mcalpine) from [Doyogawithme.com] (http://www.doyogawithme.com/).  **The AMA is scheduled for this Wednesday 7/31 at 12pm CST.** Hopefully we will be able to do the 'start the thread early, let them come in when there have been some questions' approach like we did when Esther Ekhart did her AMA. We should have more details in the next few days.

---

**Rule 4**

As promised we would like to have a community discussion on the recent rule change.  There have only been a few posts that were removed from the queue and not reposted.  I believe there was also only 1 post that made it to the top without being deleted first. There are several options I would like to see discussed:

1. Even with the rule change, there are still too many 'selfies.'
2. The rule change is a good thing, keep it instated as is. 
3. The rule change is an OK thing, needs a few changes.
4. The rule change was a bad idea, remove it.

I will open threads on these topics in the comments.  Downvoting will be disabled so that the hive can quash opinion.  Ill also enable contest mode which will randomize the first read comments.  

Please discuss this topic civilly and obey Rule 1.  

As noted before, this is NOT a poll for what is being done.  The Mods reserve the right do go against popular opinion but we do want to know what you are thinking.

When I first started taking classes, some were exhilarating while others were overwhelming.  I sometimes just couldn’t keep up or couldn’t understand what exactly was happening and would just feel like a complete idiot.  Whatever.  I kept up with it off and on for a few years and then suddenly as I got the hang of it, I decided to practice every day (or so) just to see the benefits that would happen.  It’s just kind of turned into the best part of my day because it’s the only time that I really dedicate to myself and it ALWAYS leaves me in a much more relaxes state of mind.  I want other people to experience that, but I think sometimes people aren’t sure what they’re supposed to experience with Yoga.  There’s so much hype and speculation about it.  Well here is my no BS advice tohow you can get the most out of the practice.   


#1  YOGA IS PURELY ABOUT YOU:
It’s exciting to do Yoga, you’re going to feel proud and you’ll probably brag a little bit about your new transformation, but it’s important not to forget about YOU when you’re actually doing it.  Don’t be worrying about how hot Jack or Jill is, don’t be judging the bigger one who is wheezing.  Get over yourself,  then get into yourself.  Yoga is about self-awareness… eventually.   Once you do more practices and get with the swing of the routine you will eventually notice things about how your body reacts.  You’ll notice things about your breathe, you’ll notice habits in your mind that come about not only while you’re in the practice but even outside when you think about it.  Stop thinking about outside factors – whether it be in the studio or in your personal life – and just focus on yourself doing this damn Warrior pose.  

Also,  only go as far as it takes to satisfy yourself.  When you’re in a pose, really only go as far as it feels good.  There shouldn’t be pain and you should never put your body in a compromising position.  Seriously.  It’s supposed to be a release so make sure that every time you’re stretching it actually feels not-painful.  Notice I didn’t say “good”.  Some of Yoga might not feel good, based on your own definition,  but Yoga should never physically hurt you, it should only challenge you.  It’s going show you how your body and mind work together.  Sometimes your body will be good to push hard, but there is going to be days where your body would rather lay in a Jacuzzi.  The great thing about Yoga is that it can accommodate both those moods and still reap benefits.  You wanna stretch hard hard?  Stretch hard?  You wanna rest your eyes and melt?  Rest your eyes and melt while you go through those poses.  Cause you can.  IT’S ABOUT YOU! 

 Yoga can be dangerous because people push themselves to extremes that they can’t handle.  Yoga is supposed to work you but it’s also meant to stabilize you.   I think everyone eventually finds one pose that they are decent at and hey, maybe you want to show how far you can go.  Well stop.  That should be an automatic reminder that you should probably get back on track with your breath.  Which brings me to the next point.


#2 YOGA IS A BALANCED WORK OUT, BUT IT’S MOSTLY ABOUT YOUR BREATH AND YOUR SPINE
I’ll get around to the spine later.  First, the breath.  Breathe through your nose as much as you can and breathe with your mouth whenever you need to as well, just make sure that you’re always breathing.  I think in a class of silence people become intimidated to breathe until they are forced to.  You can’t do that with Yoga.  You should always be breathing.  You should always be breathing.  You should always be breathing.  Never stop breathing.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Yah that triangle pose will make you question otherwise, but trust me, you’ll enjoy it 100 times more if you remember to keep breathing through it.   

EVERY TIME YOU MOVE IT SHOULD BE ON EITHER IN INHALE OR AN EXHALE.  Cool?  Seriously, get that down and everything will follow.   It takes practice and repetition to know when to inhale and exhale but become aware of it and listen for it in the instructions of the teachers.  Some teachers will instruct you on every pose, others will say it more occasionally– so try as hard you can to move on either the In or the Ex (which ever it is) 
You’re always breathing -  never holding your breathe - and you need to move into a pose on either an inhale or an exhale.  But all of a sudden the next pose comes out and you’re breathe is the opposite of what the instructor is saying.  WAIT UNTIL YOU NATURALLY GET INTO THAT BREATH AGAIN… okay?!… you need to breathe on the right spots to really get the full effects and to settle your body.  if you know you need to be going into something the next move with an inhale… then enjoy every damn second of your exhale, don’t worry about everyone else who is moving, and then go on your time when you’re on the inhale.  And if you can’t figure out what exactly the class did, or how they got into it… just keep breathing and wait for a spot for you to get back into the pose.   Try your best to move on the rhythm of the in/ex and you will find some pretty interesting results.  Remember, it’s about you!

Final note on breath:  Every time you exhale you should “release” the tension in your body.  You know what I mean by that?  Let go of the vice grip that that section of the muscle has become.  Like releasing a clenched fist, continuously scan your body for other muscles that are holding, and let them go when you’re in the pose.  You will be amazed at what can happen.  You’ll be deep into a pose, doing a lunge, but somehow someway you’ll be able to let go of the unnecessary contractions that are still happening in your leg muscles.  And for some odd reason that feels incredible.  It’s weird because you will be using your muscles to hold up your weight, while also stretching and “releasing” them at the same time.   AND if your breath is in a good place you’re going to be doing all these feats with a breathe rate moving slower than molasses.   


#3 THE SPINE:
A lot of Yoga is about the spine.  You twist it, stretch it and build stabilizer muscles all around it.  So A) be careful (that’s why it’s about YOU) and B) stretch/release that bad-boy.  I don’t really know what to say about it other than to always be mindful of your spine.  Make sure it’s involved in the stretch – safely – and make sure it’s involved when you’re exhaling and letting go of the tension.  I read somewhere that Yoga was used as a way to prepare for long hours of meditation.  You can only imagine that anyone who can sit on their spine in a comfortable position for that long had to have a regiment geared around it.  Learn to observe your back while doing Yoga and you will be a lot more mindful about it in the rest of your daily life.  Start associating Yoga with more than just lululemon pants.   (Canadian BTW)
A final note on spines:  A lot of Yoga’s full body work out comes because of its focus on the spine.  Every time you bend forward your teacher will probably have a bend backward.  This is important not only for physical development, but also for resting.  You only get one back and it’s fragile enough as it is.  Make sure that you “work it” appropriately enough and make sure that you give it proper homage when you rest it.  Whether it’s child’s pose or mountain pose really be aware to release and rest the spine!  


#3.1  STAY AROUND FOR THAT FINAL RESTING POSE:
You more than likely have just put your spine through hell and back… Lie on it for ten minutes okay?  Disagree with me if you want, but I think a lot of these classes become tarnished by the spirituality of the final quarter.  I’ve had too many times where teachers would bring me on a chant, force me to exude my energy to all 7 billion living beings etc etc… and so as the class would finish I would be up and out.  So I plead to you, if you’re like me and don’t care for some of that other stuff, then please do it for your back.   I guarantee that you will feel your it kind of reset itself while you’re lying there.  You’ll be in such a blissful state, hardly thinking a thought, that it won’t be so bad anyways.  So just chill and make sure you’re back has had a couple of moments to just melt into the floor before you get up.  Do what you want when you rest on your back.  Keep your eyes open or closed.  Chant or don’t chant, get internal or get external.   But stick around for at 5 but preferably 15 minutes.  And if you’re doing it at home, then there should be no excuse.  Build it into your schedule.

Last tip:  Downloading Yoga videos is a good way to learn.  It’s the exact same routine.  You’ll learn things.

Okay that’s it!  I honestly think these are the most important things to know to really develop an understanding of what Yoga can become.   I hope you guys enjoy it and would love to hear other people’s comments about things they find are important to know but don’t seem to be expressed in classes.

1366398022.0	1cox43	After an incredible yoga class (finally tried a level 2-3 class rather than 1-2), I had three breakthroughs immediately afterwards.	Antranik	108	18	15	"So I've been dabbling with yoga for about 5 years now.  It's been only about a solid year and a half though where I've been adamantly practicing it consistently (2x a week).  And in the last 6 months since I've been practicing about 4x a week.

All this time I've been going to either classes that are meant for ""ALL LEVELS"" or that says ""1-2 Level.""

I finally went to a level 2-3 class.  Found it to be exactly what I've wanted.  No.  Exactly what I've *needed.*  It was the best class I've taken in at least a year and wish I did it earlier. But then again, all that training and foundation set me up real nice, too.

So anyway, my core was activated SO well after that session and I was SO zenned out.  I biked to my local park immediately afterwards so I could play on the grass and do some calisthenics (aka body weight exercises).

I was just on the ground, stretching my wrists out and decided to go into downward dog.  And then I thought, hmm, I should try floating forward with my hips up high cause I didn't try it at all in the class to conserve energy.  ([I have been practicing this move for months, demonstrated by this video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZGXWfgOhQ))

I just hopped my hips up and my legs were straight and instead of bringing them down between my hands, *without even thinking, I just intuitively took my legs up and pointed my feet to the sky and held a handstand.*  The most [perfect handstand](http://www.wholeliving.com/sites/files/wholeliving.com/ecl/images/content/pub/body_and_soul/2010Q2/mbd105582_0410_handstand2a_xl.jpg) I have ever done.  The first real proper handstand I have ever done.  And it wasn't a quarter second long.  It was for a few seconds.  

So that was an **incredible** personal breakthrough for me.  I just did a handstand.  And it just happened. And it was all thanks to me being so mentally destressed that I didn't even think about what to do, it just happened.

Then I stretched my wrists out more and decided to *try* the [peacock pose](http://www.yogaposeweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tumblr_laikbfOJA71qdz0zlo1_12801.jpg-stefan.jpg).  I had tried it before but would always collapse my core so my legs wouldn't straighten and I'd be scared my face was going to hit the ground.  But I did it, and did it perfectly and held it without much trouble.  That was the second breakthrough.

Then there was a 1"" slackline setup in the park, which I love walking on.  And for months, I've been *trying* to [turn around and face the other way](http://slackline.hivefly.com/wp-content/uploads/01-turn-around-L.jpg) but everytime I do, I end up falling right after I turn around.  This time, again, I just did it and I didn't fall, I was completely still and ready to walk forward the other way.  That was the third breakthrough.

All this happened within half an hour time.  I felt like I was on top of the world.  Stuff I had been working on for months and months just all clicked all together in that hour.  And I believe it was all thanks to that yoga session.  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!

So yeah, if you've been getting comfortable with yoga.  Don't short change yourself.  Go ahead and try the level 2 or level 2-3 classes.  It's soo awesome."	t5_2qhq6	True

1349114975.0	10rs56	Just experienced something kinda amazing through yoga...	Kinky_Little_Shit	105	13	28	"I'm writing this, still feeling a little weird and wired, but it might be interesting to some of you.

I've been practicing yoga for just over year now, in that time I have lost my job and my girlfriend, and had to move back into my parent's house. Obviously I have been fairly down. In fact, very down, thanks to various other shit that seems to be happening to me at this stage of my life. Probably more down than I should be, but that's just me.

Anyway, I've never really been in touch with, or understood the more ""spiritual"" side of yoga. But late last night I think I might have come up with, at least, my own version of using yoga to get in touch with something deeper than just stretching and balancing. 

I felt I was having some kind of panic attack (it has happened once before) so I felt the need to rush out of the house. I needed to do something to distract myself from what seems to me like incoming depression... So I took my mat with me. I live in a small rural village, and there is a beautiful old cricket pavilion that overlooks the cricket field. I sat there for a while, then began do do my (basic) yoga. It was the first real time that I had done it without instruction via human or app, but after a year, I had a couple of routines ingrained in me. I stopped thinking, and just concentrated on smoothness, on my breathing, on what I was doing with my body and on (sounds wacky) my heart. 

Things get wackier from here, but I'm trying to put into words the way I felt.... After doing my reps for some time, keeping my eyes closed, keeping focused and trying not to think, something odd happened inside me. In what felt like a second, I could feel some kind of passion inside that felt so raw it was like I was in a rage, but it was a positive, determined energy. This was an energy that I've never felt before, and it was an energy focused on exactly that moment, on exactly that leg movement, or that exhale. After about 30 seconds my legs gave way and I fell to my box, shaking, I looked at my watch and I'd been there for 2 hours, felt like 30mins max. 

I really can't explain in much more detail what I experienced, and I hope the fact that I'm not that good with words doesn't make this sound made up. I don't why but for that minute or so it was like I was doing the opposite of crying, it wasn't happiness, but it was like I was experiencing that MOST INTENSE FEELING IN THE WORLD that is crying about something that is fucking emotionally life changing for you. But in a positive way..... Like I was balling my eyes out in a determined way. Fuck it's so hard to explain. I sat up and opened my eyes, let the wind blow in my face.

Just read all this back and it sounds so dumb....

But, the most fucking ridiculous part is that I woke up this morning with a local job offer... It's not the dream job, but it has still made a massive difference to me, and I can't wait to start.... 

Honestly, I am not a spiritual person but I feel like I changed the world's energy last night with my yoga mind, and I'm reaping the benefits now.... Obviously not, but fuck me it's weird!

Cheers :-)

*EDIT: Thanks for all the kind responses, very nice of you. I really am a little in shock at what happened, just tried again, but couldn't even get close!

I am currently deeply contemplating a move to either Colorado or Washington to start a yoga studio that would be entirely 420 friendly. I have a lot of experience combining the two and they are wonderful together. I feel that marijuana makes people more open to the practice as well as promotes deeper relaxation.

Yes, I know a ""true"" yogi would find the idea of intoxicating the body repulsive and say that I could never reach samadhi with marijuana, and I agree. Marijuana IS a substance that changes your brain chemistry slightly while you are under the influence. However, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I really do believe marijuana is a wonderful medicine.

I envision the studio as being a combination of outdoor as well as indoor studio and I would promote an environment of true openness, caring, and fun, and the weed would be a part of this experience.

I have noticed, though, that content on here is very repetitive, and the front page is stagnant. So why don't we change this up?

/r/fitness is a perfect example. Every week many threads are posted following a particular theme:
Moronic Monday. Ask a stupid question! Ask something that is in the FAQ if you don't have the time to look it up yourself. We can use this format! Those mat questions and asking about what to expect as a new yogi.
Formcheck Friday. This would be a great tradition! We can help other yogis that are unsure of their forms, and those that need help getting into a pose. There are so many teachers on this sub, so why can't we use them?
I cannot remember the other thread name, but I think it's every Sunday in which posters will talk about their accomplishments they made that week. Excellent time to post about that asana that was giving us difficulty, or even getting out of bed an hour earlier to do a few sun salutations!

We can even take this further by choosing a weekly asana to work towards, yogi friendly recipes, and inspirational messages.

I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but I'm really tired of the mat question! It's in the FAQ and no one even tries to point it out.

Try to have fun with these ideas, and even throw in your own!

Sorry mods, if I'm overstepping my boundaries!

Edit: Okay guys! Mods have been messaged and are giving us the go to start things up on our own. We are a community anyway, so better everyone is involved and not just 3 people!

So far I've read lots of love for the asana of the week. The really cool thing about most asanas is that each one can be done 3 different ways! This opens up practice in such a way that you can build a unique sequence for yourself in order to reach that pose. I think that if we give an asana of the week, we should also include what areas of the body are targeted and used for that pose, and ways to prepare for the pose as well as an alternative for those that are not experienced enough for the pose. Now to determine a method of choosing a weekly asana! Perhaps we should do a community wide vote on what type of asana we should attempt the next week. From there, I'm a little lost and would love some input. I feel like this is a more mod related addition to the subreddit or someone should be designated in choosing the asana of the week.

Now, we're getting a lot of different ideas for days of the week, but I just got a reply about wanting one for tomorrow. Tomorrow (or maybe today for some of you) is Wednesday. Hump day! Nothing interesting about it, but if a Wednesday thread is wanted, perhaps every day threads are wanted? Or should we keep them to specific days in order to keep them special and not as chorelike? If we are going through with a Wednesday thread keep in mind that Wednesdays are midweek markers, which means downtime is almost here. Perhaps we should have a thread themed around that idea!

Ideas for other days:
 I for one like Mindfulness Monday. Talk about an observation you've made or share something special with us! During my teacher training, my teacher instructed us to write in a journal one thing that made us happy and one thing that gave us negative feelings. Then to write 10 positive things about that awful thing. This would help us to be more positive and more mindful! 

Perhaps Wednesdays can be our day to talk about our accomplishments whether it's finally holding headstand or realizing that mountain pose is more than just standing still. Getting through half of a week is an accomplishment after all!

I did like the Foodie Friday, and I saw someone mention in this thread that they are excited to share a recipe with us. The name speaks for itself, and we can also discuss supplements as well. We could also do the traditional Form Check Friday, and reserve a separate day for food. We have 7 days of the week!

We still need a day for form checking or asana advice. These two can be grouped into the same thread. Let me know if you have ideas!

I'm not the authority here, so don't hesitate to share your differences and give me ideas! We should all communicate together and come up with ideas as a community.

I will now keep track of upvotes as a way of saying that you like that idea. We also need to nominate users to get threads started so we don't have 5 different posts of the same thread! Perhaps we can introduce a yogi of the week, and that yogi/redditor will determine asana of the week and start the weekly threads for that week!

Edit2: The threads I listed are not permanent decisions at the moment. They are suggestions. Please give me your ideas. Fridays are so open for different names and themes (See above). We should all make the decision together, however. I may message the mods of /r/fitness and /r/running to see how they came about making weekly themed threads for some help."	t5_2qhq6	True
1331903427.0	qzbhp	Suffering becomes beautiful (wept in warrior 2)	BirdOfParadox	101	13	24	At yoga class yesterday morning, our teacher led a flow and paused in warrior 2, asking us to hold there with the best form possible.  As the hold went on longer, the muscle fatigue in my thigh became overpowering, and my body begged my mind to stop even though I knew I had more strength to give.  Then I realized that feeling exhaustion and pain was a sign that I am alive, and that someday I will die and never feel such sensations in this body again.  Tears began to stream down my face as I surrendered deeper into the pose, with a new resolve to feel everything in my life, physical or emotional, pleasure or pain, with the same intensity.  In that moment, I felt more connected than I ever have with my own existence, and more aware of the fleeting nature of human life.	t5_2qhq6	True

I've been smoking pot for around 3 years, and doing yoga for 2, so naturally I've experimented mixing the two. At first, the feeling was amazing. I felt more connected with my body, found places of tension that I wasn't even aware of, and just had a really cool experience. I began to both smoke and practice yoga daily, and my physical practice improved. 

After some time though, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I become nervous, anxious, mildly paranoid, couldn't focus, stopped dreaming, and just really hated how shit was going. I stopped smoking, and within a day the symptoms got better. After a week of quitting smoking I felt amazing once again. 

I guess that I'm writing this kind of as a warning. I'm not saying to not smoke pot, just that, as yogis, we must realize that no drug can replace conscious, free-minded action. Although we may be tempted to get high as a means to get closer to ourselves, drugs do not do this. When we get high, we feel that our hearts are open, and that we can love ourselves and everything around us. This feeling, however, is fake and temporary. I like to think of it more as a break from being ourselves, rather than a way of getting in touch with our true natures.

So, for me, I'm still going to smoke from time to time. I realize now though that smoking on a regular basis is not yogic, nor enlightening, nor a way of getting in touch with myself. At best, it can temporarily trigger an altered state of mind that helps us to identify negative patterns in our bodies and consciousness. The point, I suppose, is to realize that getting high on a consistent basis will set you back emotionally and psychologically and will lead to you having to struggle to quit.

It's been five years now and I feel like having changed a lot since that day. It didn't happen overnight, it was more of an evolution. I don't want to bore you with all the benefits of yoga I experience, let me just name a few. I worry less nowadays, I don't panic anymore when things go wrong, I stay calm. I accept things I cannot change. I accept and love people as they are. I judge less. I'm able to admit that I don't know something. I try to be thankful for what I have and not to desire things I don't need. I try to live in the moment, be good to myself and to the world around me. Better eat, better sleep, smile a lot, make more compliments..I strive to be as authentic as possible in every aspect of my life.

I'm referring to those of you with lots of lean muscle. Please let us aspiring folks know what you're doing right. How often do you do yoga, how long, what are you eating? Do you do other exercise besides yoga? How long after you started your regimen did you start seeing results? I also accept that this isn't the point of yoga but it's a great benefit. I mostly do yoga because I want to have a healthy mind and have full range of motion when I'm older. However, I would also like to look great doing it. :) 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your comments. I feel very encouraged to do yoga on a daily basis and incorporate some cardio and pilates. I also appreciate the information and recognize the question is a bit awkward. I'm sure others have asked themselves the same question though. Thank you!

So one night in a hot yoga class, the instructor told us to go into down dog. From there, we would reach whatever leg into the air and then bend at the knee, touching our knee to the same side elbow. She eventually demonstrated what pose we were about the try, and encouraged us to try it. I tried lifting my right leg over my right arm, and holding myself up and to no avail I could hold the pose. Then on the next try as we did the other side, I could get a feel of what I was supposed to actually do, and held it for a few seconds on my left side.

And so r/yoga, I present to you, pictures of where I am doing Eka Pada Koundinyasana II on my [left](http://imgur.com/GI1AO) and [right](http://imgur.com/a9aom) side!

As I see it, the spiritual potential of yoga has nothing to do with gods or rituals or astral gemstone patchouli therapy.  It's about re-conditioning the nervous system to be calmer and more rational under all circumstances; becoming more aware of your conditioned thought patterns, so you can choose whether to embrace or reject them; developing more empathy for other people and beings; and having more gratitude for all the gifts we're lucky to have.  That's equanimity, awareness, compassion and joy, and having a yoga practice gives us relatively easy access to all that good stuff.

I had been having a really good day, and I cant recall that I was thinking of anything but the posture I was in (pigeon/king pigeon). All of the sudden the tears started rolling down the sides of my face and I was getting caught in my throat. It lasted about 5 minutes, and then it lifted and quickly as it came on. 

It was quite startling, and Im still not sure what to think of it exactly. Was I just opening something up? Was I just releasing tension? Im unsure at this point.

I have been a lurker in this subreddit so far, but I've been inspired by the positivity and determination amongst you guys. I don't do 'real' yoga, though, but I attend Les Mills Body Balance classes two or three times a week,which is part Tai Chi warm-up, part yoga and part pilates. In the last release, I was challenged by the crow pose and I thought I would never be able to do it.

Today, a good friend of mine came over and took a few photos and I thought I'd share [my favourite one](http://i.imgur.com/zy08mxy.jpg), which is based on my original inspiration. 
If there are any suggestions you might have, just fire away, I appreciate the input! One thing I don't know, for example, is whether the 'correct' pose would be with feet closed.

My intention was to accept and appreciate myself. I've always suffered a lot from self-esteem and I want my yoga to help me appreciate who I am personally. So I set a mental note - ""appreciate yourself"".

A short while into the class we were going through some flows and something came to me - a very clear thought that felt just amazing for me personally. In that moment it was a true appreciation for who I was as an individual. 

I was practicing next to one of the other yoga instructors in the studio. Of course, it was hard to me to concentrate on my own form because hers was pretty amazing. I found myself being a little frustrated because I had so far to go, and I even got a little sad because I realized I'd probably never be that flexible and never be able to achieve those postures. 

But then I realized that she would never be able to feel yoga in the same way that I was feeling it right there. My own body and my own set of circumstances has led me to practice yoga, where I am in my life, right now, and NO ONE else can ever understand that, or feel it. In that moment I realized that my postures were MINE. That they were perfect the way they were because they were ME. My halfway lift is MY HALFWAY LIFT and I am the only person who'll ever experience or know it. 

It felt like this amazing sense of appreciation for my own body and my own experience, and my own senses. 

I've been working a lot on self-acceptance lately - it's been a bit of a pet project. I have to say that Yoga has helped me immensely in this manner and I greatly, greatly appreciate what it's doing for me. 

Namaste :)

When I first started going to regular classes a few weeks ago, I could not do downward dog for the life of me. Due to a period of illness, I have very little upper body strength, and my hamstrings are also really tight. My instructor encouraged me to bend my knees and rest on my forearms or in child's pose whenever I needed to. 

In our standard sun salutations, we're encouraged to stay in down dog for five long breaths, and it's been really, really tough. I could usually only hold it for one or two breaths, if that. 

But then! Last night my teacher introduced the idea of locking our bandhas, so I tried that during the sun salutations and holy wow, it worked! Somehow focusing on the bandhas allowed me to stretch properly, taking the focus off my arms and giving me a really deep back stretch, which I so needed. And then I ALMOST got my heels to the floor.

I have done yoga on and off briefly for a few years now. I am very inflexible and extremely out of shape. I also have a pretty severe depression. This lead to me having a lot of trouble in classes and being easily discouraged. At the end of the yoga practices I felt more like crying because I felt I couldn't even keep up with a beginner practice, rather than thanking myself for the cleansing experience. 

I found my solution. 

I happened upon [this type of naked yoga](http://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Undressed-Collection-Beginner-Intermediate/dp/0982982259/ref=pd_cp_mov_1). It was all about accepting your body, and performing yoga in your most natural form. I felt a little silly listening to the introduction the dvd gave (it told me to embrace my inner goddess which was a little... strange for me), but was determined to come to terms with the out of shape position I had put myself in. Being afraid was not going to make me any happier or healthier. 

Anyway, I got about half way through and had worked up a good sweat. It was then in the muscle burning warrior poses that I started to feel negative again. Rather than go through the rest, I recognized that I was falling into a mindset that would once again sort of ruin the practice. I skipped the video ahead to the final rest pose, (checking out what else I would do once I could make it further into the video) and ended my session. 

I felt great. I know that I thought of it for a brief moment as ""giving up,"" but what I really did was protect myself from my bad energy. I felt good being naked, I forgot that the lady on the screen was naked. I just felt really natural, and I thanked myself for not only taking the time to try and be healthier, but also for thinking more positively. I plan on doing the practice often. With every minute more I can make it through the video, I have improved. Every time I watch and practice I am making an active decision to love myself, embrace my body, and heal from the years of not exercising and junk food. For once I am proud, and for that I thank yoga. 

Meanwhile It really is a good series and I encourage all of you to try it (although the men might find it weird when the narrator is telling them to embrace their inner goddess.)"	t5_2qhq6	True

Frost57	72	10	13	"Sooo, this week, I: got expelled from university (first semester so no biggie), got fired, learned that I would live with chronic pain forever (scoliosis), and I haven't seen my friends in weeks as I have no cellphone (car was broken into) and am kind of depressed so don't feel like it.

So when I came to my yoga mat today, I did it realizing that this is probably as bad as it gets. That this moment was, in some ways, rock bottom. I then proceeded to have the most joyful, serene, and enlightening practice of my life.

Although I don't believe in signs, or destiny, I do believe that it is our responsibility to deal with being ourselves at all times, even when it kind of sucks. I love yoga because it gives me the tools to do that, do deal with myself and still find love, and joy, in spite of all the shit.

And it is when we (figuratively, of course) have nothing, that maybe, just maybe, we can finally still our minds, and come closer to ourselves. I'm not saying we should trash our lives on purpose, just that, when it does happen, to see it as the potential blessing that it is.

I was thinking about the Kurt Vonnegut quote ""Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt"" all day, and as I was driving home I felt that **everything** *was* beautiful and every piece of the world connected. Everything lost any quality of positive or negative, and could only be qualified in the profoundness or poignancy in which I noticed it. I could **feel everything** not just with my senses but within me.

So, I went home and decided to do yoga. My eyes were closed most of the time and I felt as if I were one with everything in the universe. Doing Camel Pose, I suddenly felt overwhelmed by all of the compassion, beauty, and love in the universe and let the energy fill my core. As I deepened my back bend (much further than I had before) I felt all of the energy release from within me and tears came to my eyes.

I had never successfully meditated to this extent, and it was completely by accident. I just began to notice the world around me and stopped judging or labeling my surroundings.

Just wanted to say huzzah for /r/yoga breaching the 20k subscriber mark today. You guys are all awesome.

Also, [Esther Ekhart of Ekhart Yoga] (http://www.ekhartyoga.com/teachers/esther-ekhart) will be doing an AMA on 3/27.  Esther has been teaching yoga for a very long time and is an expert in most things yoga.  Her [youtube channel] (http://www.youtube.com/user/yogatic) has been around since 2008 and has over 26 million views!

**Update: The AMA is scheduled for Wednesday 3/27 @ 6pm CST.  This is pretty late in the Netherlands so Esther will be doing the AMA for ~2hrs live and perhaps answering more questions the next morning.  She will also be posting the thread *before* she will be live to allow people to post questions before she arrives.  Probably morning time in the states.**

As Esther lives in Amsterdam, we are still working on the timing issues but we wanted to get this ad up ASAP to start building awareness.  We will post this thread prominently on the top bar so that we can get some momentum going for it.  Hope you guys are as excited for this as I am."	t5_2qhq6	True

But at the same time, I am extremely uncomfortable pushing her to work hard in these classes when she could have a heart attack at any moment. I feel like I'm endangering her.

A kind of strange pain between claustrophobia, humiliation and physical torture. But today I held it for quite a long time. My head reached the floor even though my legs were not straight. I relaxed multiple times without quitting even though I really wanted to. And I wanted to cry when I finally came out of it. But today I held my best version of this pose to date.

After doing a full primary series class tonight, I had a sudden epiphany while lying in savasana: My practice is completely my own. On my mat, I am in the exact same place that I would be if my marriage had worked out. I will be the same in my practice regardless of who does or doesn't love me. I felt a wholeness and love for myself. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2qhq6	True
1370928080.0	1g3pea	Reflections of a Yoga N00b: Day 1 of Bikram Yoga	bigbreathein24	59	7	22	"So let's just start off saying that I'm not physically fit in any way.  I smoke heavily, drink occasionally, never exercise, and eat mostly rotisserie chickens and potatoes.  I'm not obese, yet I'm pretty close to becoming overweight if I keep up this lifestyle.  I'm a 22 year old female, recent college grad and 20something asshole.  

Recently I've been going through some tough shit, I'll spare you the details.  My mind and body is a wreck.  Anxiety out of the roof (highest I have ever experienced in life).  Currently unemployed, living with my parents, and grasping at anything in life to help me up. Then I found a coupon online for a free WEEK of bikram yoga! 

This was great because I've always wanted to do a yoga class, but never had the funds to just jump right in before ""testing the waters.""  The class is about a 15 minute drive through a nature preserve. Awesome. Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL studio with a very clean locker room, wonderful staff, little yogi store, and huge open rooms.  When I checked in, they were extraordinarily happy and welcoming and gave me a tour. I felt honored that they would take time out of their days to do this (and so close to class time too!).

I was surprised to see that the age range and the body type of the people in the class was of a wide variety.  Probably late teens - 60s.  Overweight and ultra-skinny. Very fit and not fit at all.  Came into the room (heated to 90 degrees), lights lowered, ""hare krishna"" playing silently, fake candles lit on the floors. Beautiful and peaceful.  I laid down my mat and took some deep calming breaths.  

That was the first time I have ""breathed"" in a way that helped me in a very long time.  My anxiety started to melt. I felt clear.

The poses were a bit difficult, but since the class was a beginner level, there were many people struggling and trying very hard, sometimes having to modify a pose, so I felt very at ease. I kept pushing myself, and I am very proud of that.  She repeated quotes of ""daring greatly"" and allowing yourself to become vulnerable to people and experiences. 

At the end of the class, I was sweating like a pig.  She put a (scented) icey towel over everyone's forehead as we lay down breathing.  Then she made some announcements and we went home.

I almost had a cryfest meltdown at the studio, but waited until I got into my car.  I felt so relieved and secure and at home.  I am so happy that I found something that will help my anxiety, I cannot even begin to explain.  It felt as though (for at least a few hours after), I could think clearly and calmly.  No more crying fits of panic, sitting in my closet at home.  Tonight is more peaceful and I feel proud that I took the chance and went to the class.

I'll be going more often in the future.  If you're hesitant about going - please do. You will never know how much it can help you until you take the first step.

TLDR; I have high anxiety and took the plunge into day 1 of yoga and LOVED it. Tonight I feel much more calm and haven't cried all day.  Looking forward to more classes. "	t5_2qhq6	True

I know near to nothing about yoga but what I experienced towards the end of the session I can only describe as something spiritual. It was as if my mind was totally gone and I felt very connected with my body with an intense energy flowing throughout. 
As an atheist this confused me a bit. I don't have any clue what it was I had just experienced. I really enjoyed it though. It was so calming and the world around me seem to be at peace. Will yoga always put me in that place? Is there more than just that type of experience? Will my skepticism negate any benefit from yoga or will it suffice to just keep an open mind?
I don't know what else to say or ask. I have never experienced anything quite like this. Any guidance would be appreciated. I want to continue upon this path. It felt like an awakening for my soul I guess. I have no clue. "	t5_2qhq6	True

I'm mega yoga keen and have a daily practice.  However, I have some trouble with the philsophy of yoga.  As an atheist, yoga to me is a great physical activity, with a profound mental aspect.  I find meditation to be a very rewarding activity, but I don't think of it terms of achieving Samaadhi.  Although I found Patanjali an interesting read - full of wisdom - I disagree with many of his sutras.  Personally, yoga is about finding peace and calm within myself, and taking this mindset out into the external world.  It also makes me very happy.

The pseudo-scientific aspect of yoga used to drive me nuts, but after reading this book I've learned to just ignore the silly things that my yoga teacher says (""literally sweating the toxins out"", ""chi-energy"", or many of the incorrect notions about breathing and blood oxygenation) and instead focus on the positions themselves.

One funny thing I noticed though is that while most of the people I know who have read the book think it does a great job a de-bunking a lot of yoga myths, a small percentage of people absolutely hated it. One girl went so far as to call it offensive because apparently the author as well as the myriad of peer-reviewed research is just ""getting involved in things higher than their understanding"".

I was at both funerals and after I returned home, I found out that my best friend, his sister and her daughter and his girlfriend all died Sunday when he crashed his plane leaving Angel Fire NM after a weekend of skiing. Their funerals will likely be this weekend. I have to teach tonight and am quite unsure how it will go, and am curious whether or not this is something that I should share with my class.

1359197993.0	17b7ha	Tricking myself into eating better with yoga	MrRedTRex	50	2	29	"This is a realization i came upon earlier tonight while practicing. I'm a scrub and it's only been a few months so forgive me if I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I thought this might be helpful for any of you as it has been for me. It's really quite simple. I've never been able to stick to diets. I wanted to look better, but had no true motivation other than wanting other people to remark about how much better I looked. And that's obviously a hard desire to sate since it's entirely up to others. 

Now, since I've really gotten into yoga, I've realized that the things I eat directly affect my practice. I've told myself that no matter what, I AM going to practice 5 days a week at minimum, and I have. And I've realized that some of my poses are difficult, or impossible to complete because I'm too fat. Or because I'm too tired, which is probably a result of being too fat. So now that I've made this connection, I've realized that if i want to eat that double whopper with cheese and fries, or that thin crust large pie with bacon, I'm going to pay for those extra calories with a sub par practice. Eating those foods will only push my goals for yoga supremacy further away. Let me know if this made no sense and I'll shun myself :)."	t5_2qhq6	True

1364085459.0	1aw062	Om Chi-gasm	JakNoLa	61	13	22	This evening I went to my yoga practice where we traditionally start and end each class by chanting Om three times. I usually chant a note of B (major) or try to match an octave lower of what the teacher is chanting, which usually turns out to be a B anyhow. When we all began chanting I sounded my usual low B against the teacher's high B, and a few other people (maybe intuitively, maybe purposefully) chanted an F#, which created the most beautiful, resonating, and powerful group vibrations that I have yet experienced in yoga. My entire body electrified, nay, *surged* with some of the most blissfully forceful Chi currents I've ever felt in my life, and it was the closest thing I've ever had to a non-sexually-induced orgasm, if that makes any sense. I could tell that everyone else felt it too, and this unity set an incredible tone (literally) for the rest of our practice together. I know that chanting Om is not supposed to be a choir exercise and in fact sometimes the greatest harmony is achieved through many discordant voices coming together, but I thought I'd share this experience with y'all in the hopes that you might experience it too.

I've selected the first book, [Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice by Mark Singleton](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7638761-yoga-body) but I'm open to suggestions for the coming months and would like to create a schedule so you can plan your reading.

I'm open to just about anything - books you would like to read in anticipation of teacher training, or a classic text like the Upanishads, or even a contemporary yoga memoir. 

Our first discussion on Yoga Body will be July 15th. It's a tough book. Singleton's writing is academic, and can be dry at times, but I'm finding it to be a rewarding read. His thesis is controversial: that modern yoga is more a product of the 20th century than an ancient practice. I think this is a great choice for our resident skeptics. 

Can't wait to hear your book ideas.

UPDATE: Thanks for the replies. I'm so excited!

UPDATE (7/13/13): I will not have internet access from July 15-17 so I am postponing our discussion until the 18th. Vote on our next few books here: http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1i9229/update_on_yoga_book_club_and_vote_on_our_next_book/"	t5_2qhq6	True

OmniscientMoose	50	5	62	"So I'd been thinking about starting yoga for a while now to improve my flexibility. I managed to sum up the courage to book a session yesterday for today at my universities gym and i'd been looking forward to it for most of today.
So I got to class about 15 minutes early as I didn't want to be late. I was waiting outside for five minutes untill someone else came up to the class and started queuing outside. I struck up a little conversation with them a long the lines of 
me-""Hey, are you here for yoga too?""
""Yea, I think its this room, its my first time""
""Oh awesome mine too""

A couple more girls arrive and I start to feel a bit self conscious about being the only guy there so I crack a little joke
""I hoped I wasn't going to be the only man here""
She responds be saying ""Haha yoga's a pretty feminine thing so I wouldn't expect too many guys"". This made me feel even more self-conscious.

Eventually everyone else arrives outside and as I'd began to suspect I was the only guy. Still being as positive as I could be I went in and followed by example of how to set up. I ended up in the middle of the room and realised everyone else had taken their socks off.
Now from playing american football, my toes look rather bad, I'm missing one big toenail and the other is black as night. I take my socks off and realise my feet smell...
I was feeling quite awful at that point and then one of the employees walked in telling us that the Instructor wouldn't be able to make it tonight. I pack up asap and leave.

I was really quite keen on starting Yoga but now i'm not quite sure if i'm gonna book into another session

So, after doing some online classes through [yogaglo.com](http://yogaglo.com), I realized that it would be awesome if there were a yoga equivalent to Kahn Academy that were free, the goal being to spread yoga to as many people as possible and effectively as possible. 

There are some free websites (see google), but none of them have the usability, quality, organization, or depth that KA does.

Now, Kahn Academy originally had a lot of trouble getting enough support to sustain itself, but eventually took off. 

But Salman Kahn, the founder of KA, essentially did it by himself. What I'm looking for is a group of fellow yoga enthusiasts with differing talents (teachers, web developers, etc.) that want to take on this project. 

This is the first time I'm proposing this idea to fellow yogis, and I'm just looking to hear any feedback, constructive criticism, or other comments that you think I need to hear.

Thanks yogis.

EDIT/Update 1: Wow, I am super stoked that you guys think this is a worthwhile idea. Thanks for showing your willingness to get behind a very much unproven idea.

So, here's what I'm thinking we need at this point:

-Project management: Someone to coordinate and make sure we have bases covered. This can be a joint effort, and I by default will be taking on all of this roll at the moment. But, I know that web people have special (i.e. efficient) ways of managing projects, so before any major implementation takes place, we need some expertise that I almost certainly lack. 

-Marketing...no wait...is that the word I want?...Basically, as I mentioned in response to WyomingEnt's post below, that we need to reach a critical mass of commitment with a variety of skills. Perhaps we'll need to work up key points for an elevator pitch and disseminate them to people we know, forums, blogs, friends, enemies, butchers, bakers...etc. 

So, I'm thinking that a new subreddit would be a good place to organize this. We need a project name. Who's got one? "	t5_2qhq6	True

Organizedchaoss	55	14	4	"So a bit of my back story (pun very much intended)...I've been doing yoga consistently (~4-5 times a week; a session when I wake up and a session in the evening) for about 3 months now. My starting flexibility was pretty poor, but I kept up with my practice, trying to dig a little deeper every time I struck a pose and focusing on form, but ultimately just enjoying the slow and steady improvements that yoga has been bringing to my life (both physically and mentally).

Fast forward to last night, a classmate of mine asked our instructor to include wheel in the class. Once she showed it to us, my immediate thought was ""oh no way I can do that"", but I got into position thinking that I'd at least try. Got up up to the crown of my head and pushed through...bam!! full back bend, great height and form. And then I did it 2 more times, holding it steady and never forgetting my breath.

I could not do that type a bend when I was 7, and I certainly never thought I'd do it when I was 27. Just goes to show, when you stick to your practice, amazing things start to happen.

It sounded like she was having sex with her mat.

I don't consider myself a prude in anyway, but I just couldn't concentrate with her doing that less than 2 ft away. It totally ruined my yoga class (and I think the people around me... I wasn't the only one giving her astonished looks) and I just can't picture trying to go back for fear she'd be in my class again.

Oh yeah, and at the end, almost shavasana, she farted loudly. I'm not judging her for that, but it's too funny to leave out.

Yesterday I competed for the first time at the Florida Regional Yoga Asana Championship. I can honestly say, from my personal perspective, it didn't feel like a competition. 

I had struggled with going and participating for months. I wasn't attracted to the idea of being judged about my practice. However, Friday morning I was on my way and still unsure of even belonging in the competition. The entire weekend was amazing. I stayed in the hotel across the street from the studio that was hosting the competition, and would walk across in the mornings (after getting out of the Jacuzzi of course). The classes were hard, but the people were kind. By Saturday night, I was exhausted and inspired.

Sunday morning @745 I took a class from one of my old teachers that had flew in from Texas for the competition. We showered, and made our way to the auditorium. I expected to see people huddled into their own groups, from their own studios. That was just not the case at all. After working so hard together all weekend, everyone was helping everyone. I hugged strangers, watched their routines for them, calmed them, made them laugh, and many of them did the exact same for me. While practicing my routine on the stage, I must have looked a bit nervous because the gentleman who was practicing next to me reached over and hugged me without saying a word. It helped, I had needed that. He ended up placing first. Such a nice guy. 

[I went on the stage around 4pm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTak2kkUFR8), there were three people after me. It wasn't until I was on stage, and in my pigeon posture in particular that I was comfortable in my own skin on that stage. But in that moment it became clear that I was *supposed* to be exactly where I was.  

The entire experience and response has been amazing, encouraging and inspiring. I have an entirely different outlook on the idea of yoga competition now.

It was in a level 1 class, that I went to on a whim because I had a crappy day and it was literally the latest yoga class I could possibly attend within 30 miles of me and it was the first group class I had done in a while.

So i'm just going to put this out there for the yoga newbs. The poses will come. They sometimes just take their own time. 10 years ago I couldn't even touch my toes.

My wife and I are expecting our first kid in 20 weeks.  Having a pregnant wife has led to some bad habits.  Laziness, sympathy eating, weight gain, etc.  

On our way home from vacation, we were discussing how it's important to have good habits in line before the kid gets here because it will be tough to start new habits when we're learning how to be parents.

So today I launched ""80 to baby.""  My new commitment to work out for at least 30 minutes at least four times per week.  A minimum of 80 work outs in the next 20 weeks.

I kicked off today with a one hour vinyasa yoga home workout.  Reading this sub always helps to keep me inspired and interested in fitness and yoga.  Thanks to everyone here for helping my kid not have an unhealthy dad.

Overall, I am loving the way my brain and body feel - stronger, clearer, more flexible.  The bit I find surprising is that I am starting to feel the ""stuck"" parts.  I thought I understood before what a teacher meant when they said ""breathe into any parts of you that feel stuck and use your breath to open that space.""  Turns out, I had no idea what ""open"" felt like so there was nothing to compare to feel ""stuck"" or ""sticky"" places.  Right below my shoulder blades - maybe better described as behind my ribs? - seems to be resisting the stretch at the moment.

Yesterday was my hardest motivational moment.  I was in the sun all day, came home to a wonderfully air conditioned quiet moment, and promptly fell asleep on the couch.  When my husband woke me, I had 7 minutes to leave the house to make class.  But I did.  This came as a huge surprise to me.  I got up and went to class, grumbling and muttering ""stupid fuckin yoga challenge"" under my breath, but I went.  And it was awesome.  It was a hard class and it was wicked hot in the studio but once I stepped on my mat, I was overwhelmed with gratitude that I made it.

TLDR: challenge going well; newly acquired strength and flexibility is serving to highlight the places where I need more strength and flexiblity; yesterday was hot in Chicago"	t5_2qhq6	True

* breath a certain number of breaths per move, regardless of where you go or how you get there

* bring a friend

* do whatever pose your body feels like - completely abandon any plan

* if you have a usual flow, do it backwards

* turn off the lights (although i wouldn't recommend complete blackness because that seems a little dangerous for my taste, a let a streetlamp come in through the window)

* if you wear glasses or contacts, go without (I'm a big fan of this one)

* naked!

* face a different direction/ practice in a different room

* put on music/turn off music/ use music you never would usually (rap! classical! punk! jazz!)

He said to get as deep as you could in the pose, and then masturbate until orgasm while you were in hanumanasana.

Please see the attached picture of the male and female mula bandha focus points.

She told me that it's because they were practicing with ego. I've been thinking about this ever since, and I've found it to be extremely helpful advice.

We all want to bend farther and be stronger than yesterday. But if we do postures incorrectly to do so, not only do we not get the benefit, but we risk injury.

If we compare ourselves to our neighbor and are satisfied at our own triumph or frustrated at our own shortcomings, we're distracting our focus from giving 100% effort, and thus not getting 100% benefit.

Don't worry about your neighbor, what you think of them or what they think of you, what you did yesterday, or what you want to do tomorrow. Just focus on what you're doing right now and doing it right...without any regard for anyone else's perception of you. Respect your body. If it hurts, back off. If your neighbor judges you for, that is only hurting them, as they are now the distracted one."	t5_2qhq6	True

I remember a few weeks ago there was an awesome thread on increasing engagement within the /r/yoga community: this lead to the incredibly helpful asana of the week and the weekly mindfulness thread. There were also a lot of yogis and yoginis who indicated a want for a weekly recipe thread, so how is that coming along? I don't know if I missed it or if the mods are working on it behind the screens, but I really would love such threads. Maybe we could have a different theme every week, in which people could post their own suggestions and recipes. Possible themes could be 'dinner after yoga', 'before yoga lunch', 'snacks', 'slow cooking', 'quick meals', 'summer salads', 'ayurvedic meals', etc. I would love to discuss diet with everyone, and I think I'm not alone in that.

Maybe to start with some questions: how would you describe your diet in general, what do you eat on a daily basis? What is good about your diet and what are your pitfalls? And how does your diet tie together with your yoga practice?

I think it's good to think about these things, and I'm really looking forward to your answers!"	t5_2qhq6	True

1356949431.0	15pw7r	Male instructors.	permanomad	45	8	39	"I read in another post about how having a male instructor would be a problem for some women and was interested in exploring this issue further.

As a male instructor, I feel like gender is never an issue in my classes. My students are all female and I have never had an issue with anyone feeling like I objectified them. They all say how they enjoy the classes and I feel like we have developed a good level of trust. They recommended me for a exhibition class at a local sustainable living festival in the spring, which I accepted.

But I cant just switch off my biology. If I do find a woman I am teaching attractive, I dont ever let that part of me take the wheel. That may make some of you feel uncomfortable that a person teaching others has some level of attraction to them, but that is not something that has ever stood in the way of decent yoga classes. A student is a student, regardless of gender. We should at least be able to be honest with others and be comfortable with our sexual natures, to be in denial or dishonest would just make us feel bad about ourselves. 

Thats why I stopped going to church all those years ago!

My point would be: if we do our jobs well and our students are satisfied, why do we have to act like that part of ourselves doesnt (or shouldnt) exist? Maybe the problem for many is simply that male sexuality exists to begin with, and why they feel that way is the question I feel we should be asking.

My usual routine is to train in the gym three days a week(barbell work, cable and bodyweight work) and I like to run a couple of times a week. I've recently added 2-3 yoga sessions to my schedule.

-- Gym work for functional strength and muscle building

-- Running for CV fitness

-- Yoga for balance/flexibility/core strength

What's the effect of yoga on muscle building and overall strength (I know it's great for balance, flexibility and core strength)?

I've made good progress in the gym and am considering switching out one or more of those sessions for more intensive yoga work and was wondering what the effects would be - It's hard to fit in three gym visits, yoga and running. I'm 40 in June so I find I need my rest days now.

TLDR: Yogis (who also lift?) - do you view your yoga workout like a weights session or not? Does yoga *also* build/maintain muscle and strength?

I had to actually think about how I'm breathing, if I'm still breathing, holding my lower ab muscles, etc. All the poses and moves were challenging, but I pressed on. The final pose where you lay down was the most relaxing / rewarding feeling ever. Haha, I was so happy to just relax and not move.

I am in my mid 20's and I have been dealing with really strong anger issues. No matter how big or small I seem to get angry at stupid things. And I realize how ridiculous they are while I'm angry at them. I've been doing yoga for about three months and it's been really great for helping me out. I haven't taken a class but most of it is through Youtube and I do 30-40 minutes every morning 6 days a week.  Seems to help. During that yoga session I feel like nothing else matters, there is no past or future, only the moment. Until I run into something that pisses me off later on in the day and all my good vibes are gone. What I'm really trying to ask is, 'is there a way for me, or is there a yoga session, that involves long lasting peaceful results.' I'm really trying to work on not being an ass all the time and Yoga and eating right has been helping but should I do a longer workout? How intense does it have to be? Or is there a specific yoga session that will help me be chill throughout the day? Any responses will help, thank you.
**EDIT** Thank you all so much for the amazing responses, I got WAY more information than I could have hoped for and I will try all these options that were given to me. You guys are awesome and I hope that in a few months time I will be able to write about my anger being more controlled.

Basically where I'm at now, I can't entirely bend like other people can. My stomach... gets in the way. I'm pretty flexible (compared to the average person, anyway) but I really can't get into certain poses due to my tummy, and I can't hold poses as long due to the weight/strain.

And then he wanted all of us to do handstands...with a partner. Many people had to sit out because they were too old or too injured or just not comfortable with inversions.  It seemed he was asking too much out of a free class with people he's never worked with before. 
He also spent 10 minutes showing off his abilities to do handstands in the middle of the room. Kept coming back down, standing up and saying ""Easy, right?"" O_o

I have read a number of articles about how yoga has been known to help depression, PTSD, and other such conditions, but I am interested in hearing stories from individuals.  I currently am struggling with PTSD and having difficulty with alcohol abuse, but am considering that traditional therapy may not be the most effective route for me.  I'm a fairly solitary person and both support groups and individual counseling have almost felt like more of a hindrance to my progress.  I recently started attending yoga classes- I'm about three weeks into my practice and am attending 1 hour classes 5-6 days a week.  I have so far found that I feel better about myself after yoga, but have an extremely difficult time with savasana, and the positive thinking effects of the class wear off throughout the day.  So also any advice on how you are able to clear your head during the final pose would be awesome to hear too!  I guess what I'm asking is if any of YOU have personally been successful in bettering yourself and overcoming mental struggles through the power of yoga.  Also, though any concerns are appreciated, I would like to say beforehand that I do have an amazing family and support system, who are here for me whenever I need.  I'm not looking for advice on getting outside help.  I hope saying that doesn't sound rude or unappreciative, just want to focus this on yoga.  So yeah!  Any advice within my yoga practice, personal stories, or even recommendations for yoga-related reading that could help overcome addictions or mental struggles.  (I apologize if this is worded poorly I'm not the best with words).  Thank you!!

EDIT:  Thank you so much for all of the responses.  I will be picking up the books that you have taken the time to recommend, and am really excited to further my knowledge through these readings.  I love gaining new perspectives.  I wanted to specify that I am not a veteran, I know it doesn't matter too much as this is anonymous but I really do not want to take credit for something I haven't done.  I truly respect and thank those serving my country, but am not one of them.  I wasn't thinking about PTSD being grouped with military when I wrote this, though I know that war is one major cause of it.  Also I know I said I don't prefer group therapy for myself, and this is practically group therapy, but I feel there is a difference.  This is all very positive, no sad tales, and I don't feel the need to share my story in order to grow through yoga.  So thank you for understanding that as well.  "	t5_2qhq6	True

At one point, he instructs to do a ""variation on the inclined plane"", I found this pose to be extremely difficult at the moment, I can't even get half an inch off the ground before I have to give up. Does anyone have a suggestion for a different pose I could use to build up the strength to do this inclined pose later?

Since the beginning of my second week, I have been performing Sun Salutations every day, following instructions given from [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij_yFtjTH1E). I find after performing these that my muscles feel very warm and I build up a bit of a sweat, which is my feeling that this might just be working!

My other question is where should I go from here? Should I stick to my current regiment for a few weeks and add more? Should I change my whole regiment after another week or two? Any suggestions would be great, and thanks!"	t5_2qhq6	True

I am going through a pretty emotional time right now, bad breakup, financial issues, and some health issues without a definitive treatment plan yet. I have been coping well enough, going on lots of walks with my dog, reading, just finding things to keep me busy and keep my mind off all the sad stuff.

Tonight in Bikram yoga class I was able to get through the standing series fine, and then as soon as I layed down for savasana I was so overcome with emotions I couldn't bring myself to continue to participate. I tried for a few poses but my body just wanted to lay down and cry. I started to feel that "" anxious nausea"" that starts to gnaw at my stomach when anxiety is building. I decided to listen to what my body was telling me. I layed in savasana silently crying for the rest of the second half of the class. I allowed myself to feel all the feelings and worries and emotions that I had been trying to deal with and suppress. I started getting a pressure/pain in my throat area which seemed to get worse when I was inhaling. Once the rest of the class was finished and settled into final savasana, I started to feel the pain going away, the nausea ebbing, and my heart calming down. I had a chat with the instructor after class about everything I was feeling.  

I got into my car and cried my eyes out like I haven't cried in years. Now, I feel lighter, happier, stronger. I can't wait to go back tomorrow and continue to do this emotional work so I can get my head strait and think things through!

Has anybody experienced anything similar?

A recent breakup where the pain is still quite fresh. An upcoming change of job, getting used to a new environment while farewelling people I've come to know and love.

That one hour on the mat at yoga class, twice a week, has been an unexpected source of comfort and ease. Hearing the soothing voice of my teachers, saying I don't have to try too hard or force myself into anything, just focus on my breath and relax into each pose. Feeling the tension leave my body as I sink into the stretches. Letting go of everything in savasana. Practicing being there in the moment.

1368823948.0	1ejgjn	A word of caution to yoga teachers regarding stiff students.	thereluctantjoiner	48	15	19	"hey, so i know that yoga is all about finding your own stretch and doing what feels necessary for you, but sometimes instructors make that really difficult. ""breath into downdog, now spread your sit bones up to the sky, keep your shoulders away from your ears, flatten your hands on the floor, lower your heels to the floor, flex your quads, don't let your elbows bend, breath into your backbody, oh, and don't forget to relax and do what feels natural."" 

now imagine how it feels to hear all this as someone who couldn't even touch their toes in a forward fold. by the time you have tried to apply every tip, your whole body is shaking like crazy and your totally unstable and you can't feel a stretch anywhere without sacrificing one of the tips your instructor gave you. and as you are acutely aware of how terrible your pose is, you hear some 22 year old former dancer/gymnast have the nerve to say, ""now make sure to stay relaxed."" 

shit is frustrating, even for someone with patience who does it every day. i've come a long way in yoga (a year ago i couldn't even sit cross-legged, even with my spine curved) and i've learned that a lot of times you have to straight up ignore all the stuff your instructor is saying and just focus on how the pose feels right for you. 

so, moral of the story is to teach the fundamentals of alignment, breathing, and the different places you should be feeling different things, but don't have students get into a pose, then give them like 6 other things to do differently in that pose and overwhelm them. 1 or 2 things to focus on the essentials of alignment should be plenty, and if a student could benefit from something else, tell that student specifically.

also, give people as many alternatives as you possible can. you would be amazed at how many people over 30 can't touch heel to glute, or can't get into pigeon without straining their inner knee, or can't even begin to get into shoelace pose. in my humble opinion, an instructor who doesn't have 2-3 alternatives to a pose isn't worth being paid to teach you anything. anyway, hope some instructors out there think about this and learn to be better teachers because of it. thank you and namasde :)  "	t5_2qhq6	True

I generally don't pay attention to other people but this has become hard to ignore. I feel like it's incredibly immature and inappropriate.

Buffalo health study concluded that pulmonary function is a long-term predictor for overall survival rates. It is essential to be involved in physical activity or sports which help in achieving better lung function. Cross sectional observation study was conducted to determine if yoga and athletic activity (running) are associated with better lung functions as compared to subjects with sedentary lifestyles and how does athletes and yogis differ in lung function. Spirometric parameters were assessed in randomly selected 60 healthy male, non-smoking; non-obese subjects-athletes, yogis and sedentary workers. The groups differed significantly in FEV1 and PEFR. The highest mean FEV1 and PEFR were observed in yogis. Both yogis and athletes had significantly better FEV1 as compared to sedentary workers. Yogis also had significantly better PEFR as compared to sedentary workers and athletes. Yogis and athletes had similar lung functions except for better PEFR amongst yogis. Involvement in daily physical activity or sport preferably yoga can help in achieving better pulmonary function.

Deviantbehavior	49	16	42	"I've been attending yoga classes regularly at a few different studios, and recently a gym, for about 6 months now. I'd say I've had a fair sample of instructors - both male and female - in many different types of yoga.

I of course understand that Yoga is a spiritual discipline, and has a long history that is deeply intertwined with Hindu culture. But besides a ""Namaste"" at the end, none of the spiritual talk seems very Hindu. It seems like each instructor just puts their own random beliefs into the practice. 

This almost always happens at the end of the class, during Savasana when the lights are dimmed and the instructor is guiding us through relaxation. Lately I always have the urge to leave and hit the steam room or showers at this point, but I understand just rolling up my mat and walking out would be exceptionally rude. One instructor, who is very good otherwise, reads excerpts from awful new agey books for ten minutes straight during this time. Another says things that make me cringe like ""Let your heartbeat sync into tune with the vibrations of the earth. Feel these 'earthbeats' soothe your body."" I guess this is something I'll just have to learn to put up with, but honestly Savasana is not relaxing for me at all when I have to listen to someone prattle on about nonsense.

To which I replied, “Well lately I spend a lot time practicing yoga. I’m studying to teach it.”

At which point John stated, “Oh really! Yeah, I’ve always wanted to try yoga, but I’m not flexible. So I can’t.”

That excuse always gives me the heebie-jeebies! “I WANT to, but I’m not FLEXIBLE. So I CAN’T.” Really? Really? I can’t even count the times when the conversation started to steer towards yoga and someone assuredly states that they don’t attempt yoga because they are not flexible. Not to gender generalize, but many times these people are in fact men. I don’t know for sure what it is exactly; maybe its some sort of social conditioning that makes men think this way, or maybe it’s a cop out. Whatever it is…I’m not impressed.

When a yogi starts to understand the deeper principles of Yoga, it becomes almost condescendingly cute when someone not so experienced automatically associates flexibility with Yoga. Not to be a jerk about it, but Yoga in its truer sense is about the unification of God; God on the inside and God on the outside. In today’s Western idea of yoga, it’s easy for someone to think that one’s level in Yoga is based entirely on their flexibility. But it is simply not true. I would like to offer you three supremely great influences in the history of yoga, all of which oppose the idea that Yoga = Flexibility.

1326533862.0	ognnt	My yoga journey thus far; thank you r/yoga	sunstorm77	36	7	1	"I discovered yoga in high school via the library. I borrowed the books and whenever I had a few minutes alone, I would try to do a few of the asanas. Because I had never actually seen yoga in practice, I was almost completely unaware of the concept of flowing movements and smooth transitions between poses and performed them more like gym stretches. Eventually, I saw yoga being done correctly and was enamored. I loved the way it looked and realized I'd been doing it all wrong. I desperately wanted to move like that!

I didn't have the money for classes, so I just rented videos and worked with them. I really liked ashtanga, but didn't really stick to a form; I just explored whatever the video store had to offer. I didn't really get much into the philosophy at the time and was not very emotionally stable and completely incapable of quieting my thoughts. As I moved through my yoga on an almost daily basis, my mental focus was often more on all the things that were constantly raging through my mind. It wasn't a quieting, relaxing practice, it was still just a series of movements.

I went through the movements of yoga like this almost every day for close to five years. Then the depression that I had battled since childhood finally got the better of me and I stopped. I gained weight. I stopped even thinking about it. After a few years of that, I went back to college and attempted to start up a practice again, but I was never able to find the time for it more than once a week. It was something, but as soon as I got into a relationship again, I allowed myself to get sidetracked and I stopped even doing that again. I gained weight again and this time, things went horribly wrong.

Six years ago, on my 29th birthday, I was told that I had accute scoliosis, spinal cord degradation, and osteoarthritis in my neck and lower back. I was told my bones resembled those of someone twice my age. I was abused as a child and there were numerous things that jarred my spine that probably contributed to this, in addition to five car accidents and years of not minding my own physical limits out of sheer stubbornness [and stupidity].

I had gone to several doctors about my back, and not one of them ever even really touched me. They usually wrote me a scrip for muscle relaxers and told me to cut down on my stress. I think, because I was so young (early 20's), they didn't take me as seriously as they would now for the same complaints. 

I eventually decided to try a chiropractor and he actually took x-rays! My spine was a mess; it looked like it was spiraling and about to fall over. I had three ribs out of place, my sciatic was pinched and I had a pinched nerve in my neck. My jaw was out of alignment so bad it hurt to chew and I had often found myself involuntarily clenching it so hard it made my teeth hurt and gave me headaches. I had spent most of the previous year laying flat on my back. I was never an athlete, but I had always been moving; yoga, walking, roller blading in high school and college, bicycling, hiking. Now I was practically immobile because it just hurt too much to move. I would wake up, not because I was finished sleeping, but because I was too stiff and hurt too much to keep laying there.

By this point, I had also hit 212lbs and couldn't even begin to move around myself anymore. Skeletal stiffness, muscular deterioration and and extra hundred pounds all made it really difficult. Shortly after my first few visits to the chiropractor, I was feeling MUCH better and able to breathe freely for the first time in a couple of years. I tried to do some yoga, but I couldn't even do simple things. Child pose hurt my arms and I couldn't breathe. Cat/cow felt like I was being stabbed. I forward folded with my hands on my knees, and every time I moved, I got major head rush. I had to slow down.

For four years, I focused on being able to walk, breathe, sleep, and get through a whole day and still be able to hold myself up at the end of it. As ridiculous as this sounds, it took me four years to be able to manage those things consistently again, but I was afraid of taking the next step for fear of doing it wrong and hurting myself all over again in some fun new way. I did NOT want to go back to immobility again!

But I was tired of the extra weight I'd picked up over the years, I was tired of being completely inflexible, and I knew that I just needed to start doing some things if I was ever going to get anywhere. For about six months, I spent a portion of my evening on the floor, moving however it felt best, stretching whatever I could stretch, holding whatever I could hold and at least trying this and that. I picked through some videos for simple things I could work on. One day I happened upon a class listing for our local community center and discovered they hosted an affordable yoga class that billed itself as a good way to gain flexibility and relieve stress, so I signed up for it. (It was kripalu, for those who are interested)

That was a year and a half ago. In the past year and a half, I have developed a regular yoga practice that still includes the same class (at least as often as I can get to it) as well as regular home practice. I have also learned that which eluded me when I was younger - the meditative side of the practice. I understand the breathing now and often use yogic breathing, even when I can't do the exercise,  to help myself keep posture when I find myself slouching too much. However, I'm also able to hold myself up longer and much more upright than I could before. I have flexibility that I haven't possessed in years (though I'm still a far cry from where I was) and I have learned how to use yoga (with supervision from my teacher and my chiropractor) to relieve spinal pressure and slowly rebuild back muscle so my bones will stay where they belong better.

And it's that last that has me writing this tonight. I've had so many accomplishments through my yoga practice over the past year and a half, but today, for the first time in close to a decade, I was able to rest in extended child and take deep, full breaths and not feel my rib start to shift out of place. I've acknowledged my limits (both in and out of class) and know what a slipping rib feels like, so I've always been very careful, but today I was able to go for the full stretch and... NOTHING.  It felt AMAZING!!! I almost cried. It felt SO GOOD!!

A year and a half ago, I had not known a day with aches and pains in almost a decade. I would get so frustrated by the hurt and the limitations I would sometimes just get pissed and break down in tears. I couldn't touch my toes. I couldn't cross my arms in front of my chest, and I couldn't hold a single strength pose. Today, I do 90 minute sets of [mostly] flowing, meditative yoga and though I still feel aches and have days when I just don't feel good, none of it is as bad as when I was laying on the couch because I couldn't breath and it hurt to sit up. I've even started being able to jog a little!

I apologize; I know I'm rambling a bit and this is mostly stream of consciousness, but I've been noticing big changes in the way I feel, the way I move, and my energy levels in the last couple of months and I'm so excited. I feel like this practice is giving me my life back and I thought I'd share it with you guys because, without ever knowing it, you've done so much to help keep me on track. Your posts have kept yoga in my face every day, and on my mind, so that even when I couldn't get out of the chair, it was still there, not letting me forget about it again. Sometimes your posts have been what got me out of my chair and moving. Thank you for being here and showing me your yoga. You have helped inspire me not only to better health, but to better quality of life.

Plus, I am out of shape. There were several times where I had difficulty breathing... and that never happens to me other than REALLY intense exercise.

I never understood why people would take showers directly after a hot yoga class. Last night it wasn't even a question: I needed it. Everything was soaked.

And I hadn't eaten anything before except a banana. After, we were so drained of energy we had to go eat at a thai place next door so that we wouldn't pass out.

Moral(s) of the story:

1. Make sure you know the length of the class

2. Don't push yourself unless you know the length of the class

3. Don't go to a class hungry.

4. Plenty of cold fluids.

Antranik	32	0	8	"Here's the scenario, you're in downward dog and the teacher asks you to bring the right or left foot up and place it up between your hands, [like this](http://freretstreetyoga.com/images/asanas/Anjaneyasana.jpg).

I have always struggled with this because my foot would come up short or I'd have to move my hand out of the way.  But I've been getting better.  Here's some things that are helping me.

I've realized it takes two things to make this happen: **Flexible hips and a strong core.**

1. Hips: If you're inflexible, you may notice it gets easier after doing [hip openers](https://www.google.com/search?q=hip+opening+esther&amp;oq=hip+opening+esther&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0.1953j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). 

2. Core: *Waaay too many* teachers ask you to go into down-dog, raise the right leg high into the sky and then step it up between your hands.  Man, honestly, if you get beginners used to doing that, it doesn't make for a good foundation because they won't understand the crucial steps to get the foot up front.  If you're flexible and have no problem with that, GREAT, but for someone inflexible like me, I can't just swing my foot forward an use the momentum like that.  Besides, that's cheating. :p

**So what do you do to use the core?**

1. Go in downward dog.

1. Really press the floor away from you using your hands (activate the triceps)

1. Then bring the right knee toward your nose, [like this](http://yoga.prevention.com/slideshows/uploads/1/dog_3_1.jpg).

      Hold your knee up to your nose for 2-3 breaths, engaging the core and really working on bringing the knee high up and forward toward your nose.

1. Then *slowly* but very deliberately, step your foot right up between your hands.  Oh and about the hands.  Keep them firmly planted when you step it through.  Don't move your hands out of the way.

So the point is to break the movement down into these simple steps and take your sweet time really perfecting the details.  This will engage your core in a new way and get your [hip flexors](http://www.fitorfake.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hip-flexor.jpg) to be much stronger and you won't be overcompensating using other muscles."	t5_2qhq6	True

Background: It takes a lot for me to cry. I tend to cry mainly because of extreme anger (there are exceptions, but that is the case 90% of the time).

Pigeon pose is a pose I look forward to, as it helps release my tight hips. I was in pigeon last night (right side) and felt my hip FULLY release. This has never happened. After the release and feeling the relief of the release, I took a breath and started quietly crying - not out of pain, but emotion. We moved into pigeon on the left side and the same thing happened. In corpse, all of these feelings of distrust, disappointment and frustration flooded me. I managed to hold it together until I got to my car, where I boohooed all the way home and for another hour after getting home.

Once it all released, I felt much better... had a glass of wine while I rested a sack of frozen peas on my swollen eyes. Today, I feel like a brand new person. I am relaxed in a way I haven't felt in a while.

http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-3912/5-Tips-for-Your-First-Yoga-Class.html

------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, I was asked by someone as to what to expect from her first yoga class. This person, oh, I'll call her...""Petunia"", really wants to go down the yoga rabbit hole so to speak, but she's intimidated by thought of being splayed-out, sweaty and inflexible in front of a room full of strangers, uncertain as to what asana to do next, or if she’d even be ABLE to do whatever asana comes next. 

Yeah, I get that. Totally. 

Ok, so try being splayed-out, sweaty and inflexible in front of room full of strangers AND being the only guy in the room AND worried that your…umm…”bits and pieces” could be on full display at any time during the next tri-dog or shoulderstand. 

Aaaaand breathe…but I digress… 

So I said to her, “Petunia, I have to be honest. It is GOING to be difficult and you simply have to expect that and move past it, because the pot o’ gold at the other end is completely worth it”. 

Your damn ego.

And that got me to thinking, “How many other people are out there, secretly wishing that they had the courage to try a class, but are afraid to give it a go because they let their ego dictate their desire?” Probably quite a few and most of them are guys. And that’s über-sad because that same attitude probably applies to most new endeavors in their lives that they’d like to try, but they’ve unconsciously chosen let their frightened ego sit in the driver’s seat. 

So I decided to jot down a few tips that you might want to consider next time you want to try something new. Yes, these were written with Petunia’s yoga dilemma – or yogalemma – in mind, but you can apply them to pretty much anything in life that requires you to dig down a little deeper than normal to overcome your fears and transcend that dastardly ego. 

One: You just have to go in with no expectations of what you will be able to, or won’t be able to do. 

Honestly, you’re gonna be rusty, it’s going to be difficult and you will most likely become frustrated. These are all perfectly normal and expected. That’s the foundation from which your future growth is built.
 
Two: There is a saying in yoga: “Honor your limits”.

That’s means to pay attention to what your body is telling you and adjust accordingly. And don’t push past what you feel is safe because your ego is telling you that you have to be able to stretch to a certain point. You can’t and you won’t, not on your first go-round. Know that, love it and work with it.
 
Three: You are your own teacher and your own student. 

The onus is on you to learn as much as you can, to remember to breathe, and to remain dedicated in your practice. Yes, someone will be at the front of the room leading the flows and asanas and adjusting your body if necessary, but think of them as a guide - a sherpa if you will - helping you to navigate the terrain of your own mind, body, and connection with the Universe.
 
Four: If you’re super-newbie, by all means DON’T go to a hot class. 

Chances are you will hurt yourself or will become so exhausted and frustrated that you never try yoga again. That’s not the goal we have in mind for you little baby bird. Look for a nice, chill restorative class first, or better yet try a meditation and pranayama (breathwork) class first to wrap your head around the vibe of the studio and the etiquette that’s expected.
 
Five: Still intimidated? That’s fine. Go buy a $20 yoga mat and a DVD and work on your practice at home first until you feel you have the courage to attend your first class. 

That’s what most people tend to do anyway. That way, you’re only splayed-out, sweaty and inflexible in front of the family cat Mr. Tinklepuss, and I’m pretty darn sure that Mr. Tinklepuss is too busy tending to his own bits and pieces to care about yours.
 
So that’s it. That’s what I’m putting out there today. That’s my simple little contribution to the world for the moment. Take from it what you will and move forward. Find the courage to either go to a class or whip out that credit card and get a starter mat. Don’t let imaginary fears rule your life, because quite honestly, sometimes you just have to get out of your own way.
 
...breathe and move forward…

Thanks!!	trueflipmode	30	1	7	"I was nervous about going to hot yoga so [I made a reddit post on r/yoga asking for tips and etiquette](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/17i8rz/going_to_hot_yoga_for_first_time_is_there_any/)  any I'd just like to say thank you.

It wasn't near as hot as I thought it would be. I bought a proper yoga mat and a towel for my mat (which I ended up not needing because of the quality of my mat). I drank water whenever I felt like it and went into child's pose when I was feeling overwhelmed. 

First off, the class had a very nice atmosphere. I think I was the odd one out of the regulars, but I didn't feel out of place. I really expected to have sweat dripping off of me like a waterfall, but that didn't happen. I had a lot of fun and felt great after it was over.

Thanks for making my transition to hot yoga a great experience. Can't wait for this Saturday :)"	t5_2qhq6	True

I'm a 21 year old tall guy (6"" 3') with long legs and arms, and I've always had problems with my flexibility and posture. I'd say I'm a down-to-earth person, but I would do anything to improve myself, and to cure my ongoing anxiety, so yesterday I went to a local yoga centre to attend a class doing basic yoga exercises. It was surprising to realize how demanding and fast yoga is, I started to sweat in minutes, and it was very hard to follow the instructions. I had to stop about 5 times, and had a headache. I go to the gym twice a week, and play soccer occasionally, so it was such a shame that I couldn't manage to keep up with the pace of the class, which basically consisted of women in their 40s. Most of the postures were painful, and didn't had time to get into the correct posture so I'm afraid I didn't do them well enough.

Reddit yogis, I need your help. 
Should I leave the class, and and do it alone? The instructor said this is the easiest class, and I must give myself time.  
When to breathe in, when to breathe out? I feel like it's completely the opposite to weight lifting.

1349556636.0	1122m4	In an awful yoga class, looking for some advice.	exteenaw	30	3	31	"I have been practicing yoga for about 5 years now, and I decided to save some money and take a class through my college. Unfortunately, it is just god awful. I wouldn't even call it yoga. And, I have felt like I've been hurting myself when I do what the teacher says. The bad part is that I have to go to the class or I would risk getting a bad grade and have it affect my GPA. 

I guess I'm not sure how to approach the class. It seems like the focus is all core strength, with almost no stretching and absolutely no flow.

An example of a class:
We lie flat on our backs for about 10 minutes. Then, with no warming up at all, we go straight into moving bridges (putting arms straight above head and lifting hips off of the floor). We hold that for a breath and then stick a leg straight up in the air. Switch legs. Release bridge. Repeat a few times. Then, with no flow or transition (or anything to release the pressure we just put on our backs), we flip around and do some planks. My teacher claims that we should feel absolutely so pressure in our hands/wrists, and that we are holding ourselves up with our core (which I'm pretty sure is physically impossible at that angle...). And then literally, that is it. One or two moves the entire session.

Is this a style of yoga I just am not used to? Is there something I should do to prepare so I don't keep straining my back and knees? It just seems like we are constantly putting pressure on a specific area the entire hour and then doing nothing to stretch and relieve it.

I am a grad student who spends a lot of time sitting-- I generally have to spend a minimum of 8 hours per day reading or writing on my laptop. I run in the evenings to keep in shape, but these long stretches of sitting time are killing me! I have developed pain in my neck, shoulders, and lower back, and it's severe enough that I have trouble sleeping and concentrating.

I'm getting help for my back pain from a massage therapist, but I know that with all the desk-sitting I do, the pain will just be a recurring problem, so I'm looking for some basic yoga poses or stretches that I can do throughout the day to keep from getting stiff and building up tension. I'm thinking of taking a quick yoga break every 30 minutes or so, for 3-5 minutes at a time.

I'm new at this, so I would love to hear some suggestions from you yoga pros. What are your favorite poses for the back and shoulders? Things I can do at home without equipment or training? Also, are 5-minute yoga breaks even a good idea, or do you really need to do yoga for a longer period of time to see any benefit?

The only time I've been able to regularly go to yoga classes multiple times a week (which I feel is needed for a good practice) it was because I was a member of a gym through my work and classes were included.

I subscribe to a yoga video website and also do my own practice, but my house is tiny and there's barely enough space to lay out my mat. The really issue is that it's COLD and it's hard to practice with a jacket on (was wearing a scarf and padded vest the other day and it was *silly*) but I can't get warmed up otherwise. I'd so rather be in a class most times. I also would like the benefits of doing it with other people.

I personally teach a yoga class once a week at the local community centre, on a purely donation basis. I definitely make enough money to make it worth my time.... so where does all the money paid to those teachers charging 5x what my students donate go?? I know many of my students would not be able to do yoga at all if it were not for my class for financial reasons.

Yoga should be about giving and sharing. I understand people need to make a living as a teacher, and I want to support them. But I feel like yoga has become a business, commercialized, and elitist. Do these teachers forget that karma yoga is one of the 4 main paths?

So we did this somewhat quick, and then she said something like 'Okay now continue this on your own at whatever speed you like with whatever variation you feel like for THREE MINUTES' and immediately she turned on a fairly-high energy song.

Those 3 minutes were glorious!  It allowed me to just get into my OWN flow at my OWN speed (to match my natural breathing) which allowed me to work on PERFECTING my transitions.  Other people used it as an opportunity to switch to turbo speed.  Other people started doing all sorts of other modifications.

I talk to a lot of people at class and occasionally I meet somebody who I'd like to at least get to know better.

I ask this as I delve into attempting to write a book about my own experience and am curious about everyone else's!. For me, I first started taking yoga from a purely physical stand point. I grew up in ballet and after I stopped I wanted some other form of movement I could dive into. I remember my first class, the teacher telling us to not judge what we were doing and to not compare ourselves with others. Coming from the super competitive world of dance this was a completely foreign (but come to find out much needed) concept. I didn't know it then but that possibility of non-judgement towards myself hooked me. I spent my whole life trying to be perfect and never wrong and it never occured to me that there was any other way to be. Obviously, that is not a fun or healthy way to live and so finding yoga and finding a way to be ok with things as they are and with being wrong has been incredibly liberating.

* been thru a shitton of injuries. only 2 postures I can't do safely -- teachers have let me opt out and I do alternative/shavasana. PM me or prowl my history for gory xrays. Im cleared to do bikram thru my pt and surgeon (s). pffft. 
* studio is 75 FEET From my job so NO EXCUSES at all not to go that often.  My body is still healing. this studio has Great locker rooms, clean showers, studios, etc. sweet fun, energetic, REAL people! Only a few mongolian contortionists.  Man, some of you are just BUILT that way.  anyway this studio is not super cheap but I must say if you go a lot it is well worth the #. Its in NYC. PM Me for pvt details. 

in any case. 

its done wonders. 
i feel like a new person. 
Reborn, smiling despite nearly insurmountable odds. 

My body is awake! Hurts so terribly some days, but never stops feeling BETTER.  Yoga is how.  

I accept that I am different every day.  We are never the same.  Life is unpredictable, chaotic.  Yoga is a way to help accept that.  Physical strength and literal balance go hand in hand, hand in ankle, ankle kicking, ankle HIGHER! 

We are all capable of everything we dream.  It is not easy.  It never will be.  We must help ourselves; yoga enables that process. 

So to the new yogis, the handstanders (I envy you!), the old yogis, the belchers in class during kaphlabahti (sp), hang in there, and always remember....

ITS YOGA PRACTICE.
NOT YOGA PERFECT.

2. I really want to do this more as a side income, not my full profession (I will be taking this course then starting University in September)...is this the wrong attitude?

Now I'm not what you would consider the usual yoga type. I'm the typical strong and silent bloke. A tough guy who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Australia. I got a real independent streak, always hitching in my leathers. Tall, not a bad looking guy either. Got dark hair. People have always said that I got a lot of charm... and I guess they may be right.

I was a rebel. Back then I was chasing adrenaline rushes and living life by my own rules. If there was trouble, I would go looking for it. A lot of sex, booze and fighting was always on the agenda. I guess at the time I was heading for a crash. When I lost my dog in a freak mudslide whilst hiking, I went awol. I guess sometimes the heart just shuts down.

Looking back on that time, I was lost for quite a while. Then a beautiful woman walked into my life and everything changed. She was a naturally spiritual person who was really in touch with herself. She taught me so many things. I was really skeptical at first but after a while I opened up to her. She persuaded me to try yoga, and it really worked. I still have a long way to go before I can reach the goals I set myself, but I can say that it has made me a more sensitive guy who is open to new experiences. But you know what they say though, you cant teach an old dog new tricks...

She left some time ago now. I dont know what happened to her. Guess we just kinda drifted apart. She's out there somewhere, doing her thing. I just hope she's feeling good.

Anyway, just wanted to say a big thank you to all of you out there for sharing your experiences and advice for the rest of us starting out on the path. You're doin a great thing."	t5_2qhq6	True

1- **Play nice** - This is a community of people that share an interest in yoga. Let's all try to keep it classy, not lower ourselves to insults or rude comments, and make r/yoga an inviting place to visit. Rude or crass comments are subject to removal. 

2- **Check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/plt20/information_hub_for_ryoga)** - Many, many beginners have posted basic questions before. Please check the FAQ before posting another 'what-should-I-wear' type post.

It's a little bit hard to coordinate what sites/methods to use for so many people, so I am going to keep on using sparkpeople.com 
There's already 10 people signed up so I don't want to delete it.

I guess what I'm saying is ideally we would all keep in touch with each other using the same medium but that might not be completely possible, so maybe we can just do a quick update at Day 15 on /r/yoga to catch up with everyone :)

What now?	rfmmiller	28	2	17	"I don't think I've ever found an activity that's even nearly had this sort of effect on me, and that I'm so willing to do consistently. It started with me waking up having slept through a midterm  in one of the classes I'm currently taking, ready to take my anger out on my hand by punching my room's wall or something like an idiot. I had an hour or two before my next class, and having read about how much yoga actually helps briefly the day before I decided to try it. I did 20 minutes of youtube videos of this stuff and my mood had wholly turned itself around. I was calm, confident, and ready to enjoy the rest of my day instead of being all pissy to everyone I interacted with because of how I got out of bed that day.

No one I really know that well knows anything about yoga - so I find myself here. So - as for the purpose of this thread: do any of you guys/gals maybe have any recommendations on a youtube channel or two, or maybe some websites to follow for the time being? The stuff I started out on is getting kind of easy, and it's sort of a bit shorter than what I'd like I think. Should I look into finding a class or something at my campus?

I now work at a yoga studio, front desk, and can take all the classes I want, but I now rarely partake because yoga for me is, well so much work for so little result. But according to all studies i've seen in the subject, I should have reduced stress and be feeling the benefits afterward, but for some reason I don't!

My sister is a bikram instructor and insisted that I go to a local bikram studio and sign up. I've never done any type of yoga in my life, and I heard that bikram is beginner safe.

I signed up for an introductory week of unlimited bikram for 10 dollars. The first day, Tuesday of this week, I got through about 15 movements, but I got very tired. It was sooo hot and my body was not cooling down! I was drenched with sweat and I just felt miserable. I layed down on my mat and determined that I would not leave until it was over, even if I layed down for the rest of the session. I came around when the breathing exercises started. Afterwards, I layed down for another 15 minutes. I got through it! I had completely soaked my towel and I could have wrung sweat from it. I was very drained afterwards. I ate a light meal, had some beers and went to bed.

The next day, Wednesday, I had my volume workout routine to do. Normally I would do 5x5 315lb full low bar back squats. I could only do a 5x3 of that. My overhead press was similar to that. On my deadlift, I dropped it by 40 pounds because I was feeling so week. I did 380lb for 4 reps instead of 420lb for 5.

The next day, Thursday, I decided to try bikram yoga again. Maybe it would be easier this time! Boy was I wrong! After about 12 movements, I was on my back and I started to feel my left arm tingle. Then, my right arm. Then my legs started to tingle. Finally my lips and face started to tingle. I could tell my entire body was starting to feel tingly. I spoke up, but my voice was weak. I told the instructor I was feeling tingly all over. She brought me a drink that was lemony / salty and I just laid there trying to recover while she went over the next 14 movements. I wanted to bolt, but my body could not move. I was still lying there 20 minutes after the session was over. Got up, felt very dizzy and layed down for another 5 minutes. Got up again, had to make very slow determined movements to get to the shower and cool off and go home. I downed a burger, onion rings, gatorade and a chocolate bar, My body was craving these things.

I drink about a gallon of water per day. I am scared to come back to bikram yoga now. What changes do I need to make so I can survive or even trhive in a bikram yoga environment?

I am a 34 year old 6'2"" 240lb male. I am on lean gains for my diet: 1900 / 2600 cycle. I am on Texas Method for my strength training program. I exude a lot of heat all the time.

Yesterday I decided to take a look around at the rest of the room and I noticed the pre-class ritual varies greatly. Some are deep in meditation. Others are in the middle of their flow.

I've been working on this pose forever, and I know it doesn't seem like a big deal because its only in its infancy, but it was such a good feeling.

I usually take vinyasa classes around 6:30 in the evening, but I decided to try the vinyasa at 12:00, called the ""Lunch Flow"". I'm typically able to power through every pose with some amount of grace, but I guess the time difference threw my practice off! I was having such a hard time! So this success was the confidence booster I needed. 

What I love about yoga is that there is always a gift during each practice, no matter how difficult it may seem :)

My main questions regard cobra pose and anxiety reducing poses. I find cobra pose to be deeply satisfying in an almost orgasmic way, is this typical in the practice? If so, what are other poses that would induce this beautiful feeling of ""release?"" I'm also seeking ways to relax through yoga and to open my mind to meditating more freely and openly. Any suggestions? Youtube video links would be especially helpful, as that's currently my only access to my practice. 
Thank you all. I believe I'm on the track to a significantly healthier and more beautiful body and mind. :)

My ex and I had been together for four years in an unhealthy relationship where we were essentially recluses, and it all ended with him trying to take his own life. Without yoga I could not have had the strength to get through transitioning back into ""normalcy"". I started practicing about a year ago today. Since the ""event"", yoga has kept stress at bay and kept my self confidence up. I practiced nearly 6 or 7 times a week, and became really close to my yoga studio (which also provided therapeutic reiki healings). Part of my transition was moving away and entering graduate school and bettering myself academically so I can move forward with a career that will make me happy. Now I feel like I'm drowning in academic commitments, and I stopped practicing regularly about two months ago. I definitely feel it physically and emotionally. But grad school is only temporary and I keep pushing off getting back into my yoga practice with the excuse, ""well, once I'm done with school I'll have more time. School is the priority, second comes establishing the social connections that I lost when I was with my ex. Yoga can wait""

Sorry to ramble, but the point here is: how do you all balance getting in your yoga practice with all of your other daily obligations? I was working only part time over the summer and had the time to throw myself into a daily hour and a half practice. But what do you guys do when you're balancing kids, school, work, internships, social commitments, etc? How do you prioritize? And for those of you who have fallen out of practice, or moved to a new area where the yoga studios are relatively inaccessible, how have you gotten back into regular practice? I used to lament a day without yoga, now I'm lucky if I get a sun salutation once a week.

1328195106.0	p7qep	/r/yoga, I'm about to teach my first yoga class (in 25 minutes) to a group of 40 high school kids (15-16 years old).	Snackchez	30	6	13	"I'm a math teacher subbing in for a gym class. The other gym teacher heard I was going to give a yoga class to my group of girls and asked if he could join in with his boys. I just went with it and said sure thing chicken wing.

Wish me luck :S

**UPDATE ON HOW IT WENT**
Basically, trying to handle 40 kids (most of whom have never done ANY yoga whatsoever) was pretty difficult. It definitely challenged my perspective of what a yoga class should be; in a typical class, we are grateful for being present, we cherish our time during practice, we remain calm, we try to focus, etc... However, teenagers demand WAY too much attention to have a typical yoga class. Trying to cater to their instant gratification needs was very difficult. In the end, the ones that goofed off, I let them be, but many started seeing the value of a good yoga practice after doing a few sun salutations. Some were actually tired out (which is exactly where they started thinking ""Oh this might actually be hard"". Understandably, you don't necessarily do yoga because it's a workout, but therein lies the way to hook your suburban teenager demographic). Interestingly enough, the ones that did goof off the most we're black girls (we have a very multi ethnic demographic at our school, they just seem to pop out the most). The boys (most of them are hockey boys) were wayyy into it; I paid particular attention to them, trying to offer adjustments as best as possible (high school teacher, can't be touching them kids, ya know), as they were the most receptive and required the most help. The best parts of the practice were the breathing exercises in the beginning, tree pose (a lot of laughing), pigeon went over fairly well (although most of them weren't doing it right, I just made sure they weren't going to hurt themselves) AND DEFINITELY FINAL SHIVASANA going into a seated meditation... For some reason, the kids really got into the meditation. They all remained really calm and quiet. It was a beautiful sight to see an entire gym filled with kids on mats with their eyes closed and focused on their inner thoughts. In the end, I wouldn't say it was a great success, but it was a good one. I was very nervous, I did fly over some sequences too quickly (warrior 1 into warrior 2 into exalted in like less than a minute), but in the end, good first class!

tl;dr: First class ever teaching, taught a group of 40 kids, EVERYTHING WENT BETTER THAN EXPECTED. Messed up some sequences, went a bit too quickly, but I survived. Kids take really well to meditation. "	t5_2qhq6	True

I've had this problem ever since I started practicing: my hair is very long and thick, but the individual strands are fine and straight. I have to use two hairbands just to keep my bun from unwinding. That usually works pretty well during my practice, until the end, when I have to take the bun out to do positions with the back of my head on the floor: Plow, Shoulder Stand, etc. Then I have to put it back in to do anything with my head off the floor, like Upward Bow, or I risk getting my hair caught under my hands. Then I take it out again for Savasana. 

There's got to be a better way.

I've tried moving my bun around, but it won't both stay up and out of the way, no matter where I put it. Ponytails don't work: the hairband starts to slide out. If you're like me, and you have a lot of hair, what do you do during your practice? "	t5_2qhq6	True

When waking up, I would just sit cross legged on my bed for a while before getting up. During this time and I have no idea why I did it, I just used to lean forward and put my head on the ground  (think half tortoise pose) but cross legged and instead of arms being extended I just used to wrap them around my head.

I remember that pose always being extremely comforting. And it made sense when I found out that the half tortoise pose was extremely good for insomnia, regulating moods etc.

I don't know if I'm far off the mark but I think the body naturally knew what it wanted even though yoga was not a part of my life then. Like I'd never read up on yoga or had been to a class. 

So I guess I was wondering, did anyone else ever find themselves in yogic poses or something similar before ever having actually done/read up on yoga?

I love yoga and I practice at my studio every day.  It's quite common for me to practice twice a day there.  The problem that I'm having is that when I have the opportunity to try another activity one evening, I keep turning it down in favor of going to yoga.

The benefits of yoga are great but I'm concerned that it's become so much of a crutch and a comfort haven to me, that I'm stopping myself from doing other things and meeting more people.

Has anybody else ever been in a similar situation?  When is enough yoga enough? lol I have been getting to a point where I feel guilty if I don't do at least a 90 minute session or if I don't practice twice in a day.  Any advice/tips?  Thanks so much!

Say you want to do work trade part time in return for free classes. You may be doing some laundry, wiping mats and checking people in a few days a week for a free unlimited membership and great connections in the local community.

2.) Change part of your space into a yoga space.
And find a youtube video to inspire your practice. Even though it's a gym commerical this is mine:

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loszrEZvS_k

3.) It is sometimes frustrating to practice in a torn concert tee and your boyfriend's boxers in a room full of Lululemon, Prana, Beyond, Mika, Shakti and other $90 leggings, SO :
Buy your yoga clothes on ebay. You can't get the best brand names always but I ordered these fierce and funky leggings and cheered up my yoga class-mates :)

I'm relatively new, been practicing Ashtanga 5 times a week average consistently for 3 months now, and I've definitely noticed changes in my body, mind, and some other strange physical/non-physical part of my self. Today was a particularly intense practice, in fact this whole week has been intense, and I've been trying to put more of myself into my practice. I normally like to spend about 15-20 minutes in savasana, and it usually takes about 5-10 minutes for my mind to slow down enough to enter a meditative state. Today, at around 10 minutes, I was pretty deep in my mind when I suddenly felt a rush of energy, sort of like electricity, rush through my body and make my limbs tingle. It was a sustained feeling, and I found that I could focus my mind on a single point in way I've never experienced before. Nothing like that's ever happened before, but it was a good thing.

At first I thought I wouldnt fit in because I am overweight and not very fit but I really wanted to try it so I grew some courage and went to class. I live in NYC and yoga seems to be everywhere and living in this city and not being active can turn you into a couch potatoe. So I got to class and found out that not only did I not feel judged but I loved the feeling of using your body and waking all your muscles up. I also started feeling calmer and happier during the day. I went almost 5 times a week until it got to cold and I stopped going to class. I started feeling sick and sluggish and I decided it was time for me to get back into it. I went to my first class today and as I sit here still sore and alittle disappointed in myself (I didnt try 100% and the feeling of weakness is run over my body just like my first class ever)  but I feel amazing and I have a lot of hope for the future.

And a strange sensation when I get into forward bend has been occurring. It also happened when I did it in high school, but I didn't pay attention to it.


NOTE: This is going to sound weird, and it deals with the perineum/anus, so sorry about that if you are uncomfortable reading about those things.

With my legs straight and over my ankles, I get a sort of stimulated sensation near my anus. I seriously think it is my prostate. The problem is that as this continues, the stimulation becomes almost unbearable (doesn't hurt, but can't be maintained), and my legs become weak and wobbly.  The problem is that I am finding it difficult getting deeper into the position, because I can't hold it.

I've been an on and off practitioner of hatha, anusara, and more recently, sivananda yoga.  Today I tried Bikram for the first time. Geeze. Never have I ever thought I was in ""hell"" during a yoga session. A room heated to 109 degrees F (I checked), little to no air flow, and very high humidity. At the end of the session, my yoga shorts and shirt were completely soaked through.

I don't completely understand what motivates a person to subject themselves to so much heat. What I do understand is that the heat makes a person more limber and able to stretch the deep fascia and connective tissues in their bodies. This extra limberness is what I did experience; I found myself being able to go a little bit further. Here is my question for dedicated Bikram yogis: what have you gained through regular practice of Bikram yoga? Another one I have in mind is: if you switched from another form of yoga to Bikram, what was your reasoning?

EDIT: I've also done heated vinyasa flow, but at a lower temperature and much lower humidity. IMO, it doesn't compare to Bikram."	t5_2qhq6	True

(NOTE: the 'R' is pronounced 'H').

One of his biggest attributes (beyond an incredible understanding of technique / leverage of the human body) was his mind and physical conditioning. Much of which was attained through yoga, breathing and Ginastica Natural.

There are huge parallels between the type of functional movements we do when we fight and yoga. When we warm-up for classes, we'll work a series of flow movements that will seem incredibly similar to some asanas.

Here is a famous scene from a documentary on him where he does a brief movement workout on the beach and then shows Nauli breathing, which is just unbelievable to watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTi_E78DSK4

It's also included in this slightly longer compilation of him doing yoga and some other stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB_KRHXU1BA

All of the above is in the full documentary 'Choke' which follows him going to Japan to compete in the Vale Tudo where he won all fights by submission. Fascinating watch in and of itself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjvzJO-6ESc

I got fired from my first regular teaching job today.  Today was my second class. Last week, it was great. The owner of the fitness studio attended. Everything was fine. Today, a couple ladies came and didn't like my style. They complained, and since the studio is new and can't afford to lose customers, I got fired.

I'm not angry. I completely understand. I'm still pretty green when it comes to teaching. However, I was prepared. I had spent hours thinking about a balanced class and practicing. I always teach my hubby the night before a class to make sure my class flows, is long enough, has proper cues, etc. I'm just disappointed and sad. I feel like I've completed my RYT and still can't teach. 

I'd love for some advice or suggestions.

**Edit for update:** Thank you all so much for the encouragement and advice.  I feel the yoga love - something I really needed. I cried quite a few tears last night, but today is a new day. 

Yesterday's events resulted in a candid conversation with a gym that is interested in having me sub.  The group ex director (and fellow RYT) understood where I was, and she feels it's the responsibility of the experienced teachers to mentor the younger folks.  I was completely honest with her about all that happened, and she didn't judge and was very supportive.  I believe everything happens for a reason, and hopefully this has helped me find a comfortable, supportive place to grow.

The one thing that causes me hesitation is practicing the 8 limbs of yoga and this very spiritual attachment involved. Frankly, I'm an atheist and I struggle in class to find peace/relaxation when my teachers are talking about divinity, god, etc. It just makes me feel a little out of place and stirs my brain into activity rather than doing the opposite as it should be. It is certainly not a big deal and I still enjoy classes but sometimes I wish my teachers would focus on the mind/body dualism elements as that seems like it would be the more pragmatic way of finding one's peace in yoga.

And then there's the notion that you are not a true yogi unless you practice it in its entirety and properly. I struggle with this as I don't want to simply feel as though I'm appropriating a cultural practice and molding into my own but I have no interest in the spiritual aspects of it and it would feel hokey for me to even try.

1333729847.0	rwgcw	Yoga + Money...thoughts?		24	3	23	"*Warning, this may be long so kudos if you stick with it!* So I have been teaching yoga for a year and a half. I became a teacher because of the profound transformation I experienced through the practice (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual). I am incredibly passionate about yoga and sharing it with others and it is something I would like to make a living from. Through my own experience and through observing in the world (and r/yoga comments), I find a huge disconnect between yoga and money.

For myself, I definitely have some issues with the commercialization of yoga. For instance, I don't like Bikram trying to copyright this ancient practice. I'm not comfortable I am with yoga studio ""chains"" that, just like any other chain, pushes out the mom and pop places. I hate that it costs at least $600 to take a workshop at Kripalu (where I was trained). I don't like the feeling that yoga is only for the well to do or that money would keep people away from it. 

On the other hand, I myself want to make a living doing what I love. I want to be able to be comfortable and not worry about making rent or putting food on the table. It's incredibly draining to give so much of yourself in a class without getting much back (excluding of course, the non monetary rewards). It doesn't make, at least for me, great teaching. 

And why should yoga teachers not be able to support themselves? Why do we resent teachers who are successful (Kathryn Budig, Shiva Rea, etc)? I realized in a meditation the other day that my resentment sprung from my own feelings of not being good enough and not deserving of abundance (which is a reason I wanted to ask you lovely people). For me, it was a reflection of my own insecurities around myself and my own worth, in general as well as financially. And seriously, how does that serve anyone?

I feel great after class is over, but the last ten minutes or so, especially savasana (which used to be relaxing when it was just a workout class to me), is hell.

He is stating that I’m not “resting” enough for my body to recover from all of the exercise I’m doing and that from all of the literature he’s read anyway that it’s not ideal to be exercising as much as I am anyway.  He’s convinced I’m on the path to wrecking my body and that I’m going to permanently injure myself.


This is kind of interesting because I obviously don’t feel like I’m doing that much. Sure, I complain about sore muscles a lot but I often just exaggerate my soreness out of silliness (ie : crawl across the floor to pet my cat because my legs are sore). Now I know that Ashtangis practice 6 days a week or even 7 days a week (some people in my classes do it every day) and that’s too much for me. I am not ...interested in doing it that much anyway.


This is my schedule so far:

Monday – Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 1hr 30 minutes

Tuesday – Rest day

Wednesday – Ashtanga Primary series 1hr 45 minutes

Thursday – Intro or modified ashtanga Primary Series  1 hr 30 minutes

Friday – Rest day

Saturday – Primary Series 1hr 45 minutes

Sunday – Super Intro Ashtanga class 60 minutes (because my friends are still doing this one and it’s light exercise)


Ideally, I would like to replace Tuesdays with the Primary Series and simply just have Fridays as rest days and Sundays as very light exercise days. 


What do you guys think? Is this really “so much”? I mean, I’m not even doing resistance training or running where my knees could be impacted from doing the same type of exercise every day. Jiu jitsu and yoga are both diverse :/ IDK I feel like I’m fine but I suppose I want some second thoughts.

1368030274.0	1dxtpn	Using yoga to help with anxiety?		20	1	23	"Hi everyone,

I've been lurking here for a while and have dabbled in beginner's yoga, but have virtually no knowledge about it other than it makes me feel awesome when I'm done (maybe someone can give me a brief crash course?).

Recently, I have really been struggling with some mental problems and the biggest stress has been the anxiety. Last night was particularly rough, so I sat down, found a link on youtube called Hatha Yoga Flow 3, and went at it. 
After 40 minutes, the change was so drastic and I was so at peace. The negative feelings came back about an hour or so later, but for that hour I was just so relieved and at peace.

I would like to continue to use yoga to treat my anxiety. Where can I start? Are there specific asanas or a guided video I can work with that target quieting your mind in particular? Or really any type that someone thinks would be helpful to my situation. 

Thank you for any information. Like I said, I virtually have no knowledge about yoga.

Edit: It seems the verdict is that almost any type of yoga works wonders for stress, anxiety, and clearing your mind. I'm so very excited to read about how many of you had success with this method, and I'm eager to continue with my own journey. Thank you so much for taking the time to read/respond. "	t5_2qhq6	True
1367582021.0	1dm46e	The day after running/playing sports makes yoga feel even more great :)	kingmathyou	28	8	4	Just something I wanted to share for everyone: Yoga is fantastic, but it isn't the only physical activity you should have. Make sure to get outside and run around in nice weather once and a while. There is nothing like waking up sore the next day and doing some yoga. I play soccer 2-3 times a week, and noticed that the day after I play I am always much more flexible. Yoga stretching feels really soothing on my sore muscles. Go get outside and enjoy running around, your yoga will thank you later :) 	t5_2qhq6	True
1367196056.0	1db03v	Morning yoga is almost impossible	kgloeck	24	3	32	I've been practicing on and off for 3 years, and recently have gotten back into a daily yoga practice. I've seen a huge difference in my practice in terms of focus, strength and meditation. Today I went to yoga at 9AM, when I almost always practice after 5. It was the hardest thing for me. I had only had a glass of water with lemon and a few nuts as I rolled out of bed and went, but I didn't feel hungry. I just felt weak, had no balance or focus and was generally grumpy. I could say I'm just a night person, but what does that really mean? Any insight about why my body is more energized and focused in the evening and so awkward in the morning? 	t5_2qhq6	True
1366648670.0	1cvdwb	Yoga with an App	mario8891	26	5	22	Hello. I've recently decided to try doing yoga at home. As an overweight male, I would feel awkward going to a yoga studio. Plus, I really don't have the money for it at the moment. I was wondering if anyone on here has ever practiced yoga with a phone or tablet app. I found some good android apps but I would appreciate any suggestions you all had. 	t5_2qhq6	True

It wasn't a ""teacher in a weekend"" class, just one of many classes my instructor offers to those interested in teaching, or just expanding their practice of Iyengar Yoga.

We discussed sutras, and did a few teaching exercises, which was a new experience for me!  I found out that I loved it, and my instructor has encouraged me to get out and ""teach"" with my friends and family.  I have a few victims...er...volunteers already, and they are looking forward to helping me learn!

I just had to share my wonderful experience with all of you, because I know you will all appreciate it!"	t5_2qhq6	True
1365137618.0	1bpr9p	Did my first Bikram Class in 10 years! with screws in foot, knees.	jyar1811	25	5	24	"I wobbled like an earthquake and did maybe 65% of poses.  Many are not good for my particular knee issues; tht said, when I was not able, too tired, or otherwise, I simply sat quietly in lotus pose and continued breathing, but my teacher understood and was good about it. 
Only criticism -- the room was too hot, though. Im just recovering.  Other practicioners spoke up; but it took a group mentality.  

Thanks all for the inspiration.  99% of the battle is walking through the door.  Just breathe if thats all youre up for!

1364131756.0	1awuh7	Should I boycott Bikram yoga, because Bikram Choundry sexually harassed students? Or Anusara yoga because John Friend sexually harassed multiple students with a Wiccan sex coven?	selahtrash	31	10	40	"I never really got down with Bikram yoga, especially once I heard he was trying to ban the teaching of hot yoga unless studios paid him royalties. Bikram Choundry is also a massive tool. But I love Anusara yoga, and only recently found out about the sex coven and him taking advantage of his platform as a loved instructor, and a Wiccan leader (also, not my thing...) to get women to have sex with him? I'm very familiar with cults and people trying to blur the line between sex and devotion, so I am very against these two founders. However, does it make any sense to boycott these practices? Or should it be more of a ""hate the player, not the game"" situation?

1364130466.0	1awts3	The debate of music in a yoga class.	nilbogresident	21	3	48	"Just returned from a Baron Baptiste Immersion seminar in Charleston SC (which was amazing) and got into a debate with some yoga teachers about playing music during a class. Both teachers frowned upon music and said it was counter-intuitive for meditation and focus. I argued that music in yoga actually helps me clear my head, makes challenging poses flow more easily, and just simply adds more happiness to my practice. What are your thoughts?

Edit: I love the different viewpoints! After some reflection I am coming to the conclusion that it all depends on what you hope to get out of your yoga class.... Duh. I have to admit I do love practicing at home to my eclectic playlists played loud, everything from minimalist Gabrielle Roth and Wah! to less conventional ""yoga"" music like Burial and even Florence and the Machine. But I do concede that it hinders mind-body connection and can prevent you from staying focused on your drishti.  But I love music with a passion and I remember the first time I went to a vinyasa class with a great playlist-- my energy level was higher and I kept smiling the whole class! Surely that feeling cannot be something negative.
