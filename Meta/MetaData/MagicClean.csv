Houdini then goes to the Bakery owner and asks him if he wants to see a magic trick. The curious owner answers, ""Of course!"" Houdini proceeds to ask him for a Doughnut, and then eats it. He asks him for another one, and then eats it as well. He then asks him for a third one, which the owner reluctantly gives up. 

""So where is the magic trick? I gave you 3 donuts already!""

Houdini responds, ""Go check Criss Angel's pocket.""

We saw them last week in Vegas and after the show they make a practice of hanging out in the lobby signing and posing for photos. We got our kids' programs signed first and then when it was apparent that they were still hanging around, I went back and got mine signed too. THEN with only a few fans left we hung around to see if we could get a photo with *both* of them (they started in separate places in the lobby likely for traffic control). 

Teller was done first and we asked if we could get a photo with both and he said ""absolutely"" and then stayed there talking to us for 3-4 minutes while Penn finished up. He signed my son's cast (broken wrist) and talked to him.  Then we all got our group photo.

It cost them maybe like 45 minutes and simultaneously made the evening of everyone who stayed.  Classy. "	t5_2qh74	True

I think this could be a really great magic community if we all just got more involved, myself included. Even if only 10% of the readers here take the craft of magic seriosuly we could have 500 really active members. On a good day we average about 5 posts, lets try and build this up.  

We can start posting: 

Reviews of dvds, books, and tricks (making sure not to reveal any secrets or specific gaffs). If youre interested in reviewing and have not done one a good example is how they review on the Wizard Product Review (i started posting the videos here on wednesdays).  

Question. Like a AskReddit. Some great questions have been posted lately and they are a lot of fun to contribute to and read. Lets keep asking questions.  

Videos of magicians or if youre looking for specific feedback on your taped performance.  

Help with resourcing material. I have a large magic library and would be willing, as i am sure others users will to, to point you in a direction in regards to magic material.  

Routine ideas. Need help? Just ask. Willing to share one of your sets, please do.

All in all i would like to see this become a more active community. If you have the time please help contribute by writing a review, posing a question etc... I love magic and i love reddit. Lets make this sub even better.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Jokers247.  

I will try and post a review of something tomorrow. Not sure if im going trick or book yet.  

A note about myself. I consider myself a knowledgeable and skilled magician. I have been doing magic for around 13 years (with a little break thrown in there). I was. Member of the Magic Castle Junior Program from the age of 15-21. While a Junior i performed at the Castle during there Future Stars of Magic Week. Once i turned 21 i became an adult member and have been since. I worked in a magic shop for a year. I did magic semi professionally for a few years. I now do magic behind a bar twice a week and will be posting my number one bar set shortly for everyone. I recently built a formal close up act that is still being tested and am currently building a formal parlor act. My area of magic knowledge is close up and parlor.  

Once again thank you to all that read this and feel the same way that i do. Its all about involvement and i hope this takes off.

I'm not a magician.

I have an interest in magic, but I'm not a magician. So take everything I write as a layman, although a lay man who has an interest in magic.

One of the more popular magicians in the UK is Derren Brown. His patter involves him heavily suggesting that he isn't doing tricks at all, he's using psychology. A lot of people believe this, I've had conversations with people who were convinced he wasn't a magician. That he doesn't do tricks. These people then go onto believe a whole range of pseudo-scientific nonsense. It's very difficult to then convince these people that what they saw was a trick, without actually revealing the trick.

The worst episodes were the lottery prediction explanation (wisdom of crowds) and the Manchurian Candidate episode. Both were done in such a way that someone who lacks some critical thinking skills could easily come away with a quite twisted view of how real life actually works.

At what point have you gone past tricking people and have begun to influence their world view ? When is a magician not just doing tricks but spreading pseudo-science ?

I saw a similar show on Nat Geo, a magician who for the first 40 minutes or so was talking about, and performing, some brilliant card tricks, brilliantly. The last 20 minutes he got onto muscle reading and reading peoples eyes etc all in a build up to a big stunt. The last 20 minutes I found really hard to watch.

Now, I'm aware of Derrens work on shows where he debunks psychics and faith healers etc. I think this is great, even though I don't think it's Derren Browns responsibility to debunk anything. If he wants to do it though, brilliant. This could make it worse though, in a way are people more likely to believe Derren Browns brand of bullshit because he has debunked other peoples bullshit ?

I'm just not comfortable when a magician goes beyond tricking people as part of the trick and begins to influences their world view just as much as psychics and people like Uri Geller do. He isn't selling a product, e.g. magic healing crystals or a conversation with a departed family member, but he is selling himself be it to get bums on seats in theatres or his TV shows on the TV.

So where is the line ?

A magician has to be dishonest, I understand that, it's their job to fool us. However, don't they have some responsibility to the audience to fool but not mislead ? I feel the audience should leave a magic show knowing they've seen a skilled magician performing tricks well. They shouldn't leave thinking if they go and spend £5000 on a body language reading course they are going to change their life.

Is this a problem that is just isolated to mentalism ? It's a field of magic I have a real hard time with. I think it's probably a difficult balance to find in mentalism. No one actually believes anyone can fly or can saw a woman in half but the patter on mentalism is often just plausible enough sounding that people will believe it.

I find most mentalism to be incredibly patronising. I love watching a skilled magician fool me, but if you want to fool me and you want me to believe the bullshit you're talking then I'm not going to like your act. I feel like you think that I am a gullible idiot.

*Beginner*

**NEW Modern Coin Magic** by J.B. Bobo - The bible of coin magic.  Has enough magic in it to last you a lifetime.  A little dated and not the easiest to learn from.
    There are several DVD accompaniments to Bobo's.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Ben Salina's which I've heard mixed reactions about.

**The complete introduction to coin magic** by David Amar (book)  - I have not watched this video, but I have heard it is fantastic to learn from without prior knowledge.

**Basic Coin Magic 1 &amp; 2** by David Stone - (DVD) A great DVD but a little advanced to to a first dvd.  Some great stuff though, and I would recommend picking it up.  The Coin and Pen routine on #1 is one of my favorites to perfrom. 

**Expert Coin Magic videos volumes 1-3** (DVD) - Again, I haven't watched it, but I have heard it is your best bet for picking up coin magic.  Roth is a fantastic teacher and gives lots of great tips for the classic palm and shuttle pass especially.   

**In the beginning there were coins** by Jay Noblezada (DVD) - This is what I learned from, and looking back I would have prefered to learn from one of the above three.  That being said, it was not a bad dvd.  Clear instructions into the basics.

**Metal** by Eric Jones - The most modern way to start coin magic.  I have heard nothing but good things about it.  

*Intermediate*

**Expert Coin Magic** by David Roth (book) - This book will often be suggested for beginners, but I disagree.  Nothing particularly hard, but it is patchy in what it covers with regards to the basics.  Some amazing material in it.  Some of the best routines you will find.

**Coin Magic** by Richard Kaufman (book) - in a similar vein to Expert Coin Magic.  This is a compilation of coin magic by some of the greats.  Again, great routines that are very usable.

**New York Coin Seminars** by asst. (DVD) - A HUGE collection of just about everything.  It is impossible to convey how much information is on this series.  Pretty much all you ever wanted to learn about coin magic is encompassed within this DVD series.

**Encyclopedia of Coin Sleights** by Michael Rubinstein (DVD) - very extensive list of coin sleights.  It is something every coin worker should own if you are serious about coin magic. 

**Covert Coins** by Charlie Justice (DVD) - This is a cheap DVD that has a lot of really cool stuff on shells.  I only mention this because it is a recent acquisition of mine and I'm really enjoying the material on it.  Not the greatest teaching, but fantastic material.

**Coin Classics Volume 1** (DVD) - Nothing revolutionary on here but a good smattering of lots of different effects to learn from.  A lot of the greats put forth routines for this DVD.

*Advanced*

**Sick** by Ponta the Smith (DVD) - This is difficult stuff.  Beginners who pick this up are led to believe they can perform the stuff on the DVD, but will be unable to come even remotely close to the smoothness of Ponta the Smith.  That sounds really scathing, I know, but this should not be marketed as a beginner dvd.  That being said, it is inspirational to see how fluid Ponta is with coins.  His coins across routine is one of my favorites.  His shuttle pass if unbelievable.  His matrix stuff is lacking in my opinion.

**Sylvester Pitch** by Sylvester the Jester (DVD) - Really great utility move that is a bit difficult to master.  Teaches an amazing miser's dream routine that is performed out of your pockets.  

*Misc*

**Levent's Ultimate Guide to The Miser's Dream** by Levent (DVD) - A great resource for everything on the Miser's Dream.  If you want to learn this routine, I suggest you get this DVD.  You should know the basic palms and sleights before purchasing this.

**The Complete Muscle Pass** by David Kong - Excellent resource for the muscle pass

1370196168.0	1fj2hm	Sunday Essay: How Patter Killed Magic	RC-Roi92	26	3	14	"Made you raise an eyebrow, didn’t I? This wasn’t really meant to dismiss patter as a whole or the idea of presentation, but rather the fact that patter has made this entire world of store-bought patter possible. Let’s admit it: we’re one of the very few arts where you can buy readymade material. Think about how dull and boring a stand-up comedy act would be if the same jokes (cups and balls, linking rings, etc.) were told every time. It would seem odd for a stand up comedian to use some other guy’s material, because in reality it’s not his to perform. 

If we pick up from where we left off last time, comparing magic to music, it would be similar to 1% of musicians creating 95% of the material, and the remaining 99% of musicians doing covers of that material. When store-bought tricks entered the stage, a gap formed between performer and material. It’s like playing a cover song: It will never really be your story to tell (although, there are a few exceptions).

By story, though, I don’t want you to grow a huge white beard and a deep full voice; I just want you to put a little bit of yourself into the magic you perform. Magicians seem only able to compare themselves to other magicians, like living in a vacuum where the only art is magic. Try comparing your magic act to a movie; does your magic have the same ups and downs that the movie provides? What do you leave the spectator with? Do you have a vision? Does you magic leave anything other than a puzzle? 

So, does this mean that we should only perform our own material, and if we can’t create anything worthwhile, we should quit? No. But it does mean that you should do everything in your power to remove anything that isn’t you out of the tricks you buy. Only then should you start creating your presentation. In my book presentation isn’t just about the words you say--there’s so much more to consider. Think about your gestures, and not just from a deceptive point of view, but how it affects clarity of effect. Think about Teller and how clear his actions are; it’s because every single movement he does is aimed to enhance clarity.  Patter is to lessen our art to “Do the moves and say the words.” There’s so much more. Script your words, look at your gestures, routine it to fit the mood and practice the hell out of it, so you can improvise if you get the chance. That’s presentation, that’s the level of dedication our art deserves.  

We as magicians have materialized our art. In essence, we’ve sucked the art out of our art; it is our job to push it back in.

Being somebody who in my youth loved to learn and perform one-off magic, I jumped onto /r/magic and went through hundreds of the top all-time posts.  You guys have been busy!

Along the way I learned that magic isn't about doing a ""trick,"" rather, it's about telling a story.  Any sleight of hand or illusion is secondary to the story itself.  A magnificent drawn-out story backed by a single sleight will trump a ""pick a card"" performance filled with all sorts of dexterous moves but with no story.  Story matters!

I also saw a Triumph performed here on /r/magic for the first time.  I had to learn it...and I did.  It was tough, grueling work.  OMG.  And that was just to learn the moves.  Now I'm off to tell a narrative around it...to turn it into magic.

1330482897.0	qaodp	The Starbucks Solution by Lee Asher.	BriarMagic13	20	2	5	"I don't believe in ambushing strangers. However, nothing is more enjoyable than taking new pieces you've been working on (after they're ready for primetime) and performing them for unsuspecting strangers. Below is the exact approach I use, patter and all.
In my opinion, this is one of the better ways to venture out of your comfort zone to premiere new pieces. For instance, let's take a new card trick you want to try out for the first time.
Casually play with your deck of cards at the table in your local Starbucks. Don't be obnoxious or overly obvious, just do a few fancy things, like you're entertaining yourself. This inevitably catches the attention of nearby customers. The two nice things about Starbucks customers are they usually aren't racing off somewhere, or consumed in heavy business / romantic conversations. In short, they're 'ripe' for a bit of friendly disruption. 
Wait for a moment where you see someone (close enough to you without getting up) looking at what you're doing. Turn to them (and the group they're with, if any) and specifically say, ""Hey, let me show you something I'm playing with. I really wanna hear what you think."" Flattery always works! 
""It'll only take a second, and it is relatively painless."" Humor goes a long way when performing for strangers too. 
Notice my patter line is not overly mystical and I'm not coming on strong as a magician who's gonna fool them or mess with their head. I certainly don't come across as someone begging for spare change, but rather, my approach is a down-to-earth guy who wants to unobtrusively show them 'something cool and entertaining'. 
The chances of them refusing you are almost zero.
Now engage them with the piece you're prepared to perform. That's it, you're in.
In the one percent chance case they say no, thank them anyway, sit back in your chair, and keep playing with your deck of cards. Remember, you still have 99 more chances to go.

you don't have to know a lot of tricks to get started, simple things like a sponge ball routine, cut and restored rope, or a signed card routine is enough to do 10 - 15 mins set  
or if you only do close up magic for 2-3 people you can do some of those things when they visit hospitals etc.

The best instance I can remember was back when Robert Smith's Wounded had just come out. 

Luckily being a fan of geek magic at the time (*actually still am), I used to carry the 'set up' in my messenger bag along with all my books and what not. 

Well one time during a midterm (molecular physics) I was completely under prepared. 
I pulled an all nighter and dispite studying for hours - I retained none of the material. 
The midterm was worth 40% of my total grade in the class, so you can imagine - it wasn't the best test to have been under prepared for. 

I had a very strict German professor who wouldn't even allow you to use the bathroom once the test began. 
If you got up during the test, than you were done with the test. 

- 
Now I don't advocate cheating, but I do subscribe to the mentality of.. do what you have to do, but don't lie to yourself and say it was the right thing if it wasn't. 

So, I skillfully applied my Wounded set up - walked down to the podium and explained I wasn't feeling well. 

He told me, ""this is to bad, you can not leave the roo...o.o.. oh my god - you're eyes... you're eyes are bleeding"". 

Sure enough I had tears of blood streaming down my face 
ಥ‿ಥ

Needless to say I was allowed to leave and re-take the test later. 


Edit: This isn't me... and it pains me that the only internet videos I could find are of 13 year old kids preforming the trick.. very poorly. 
But alas at least this will give you an idea of what the trick looks like, albeit via a bad performer.

My mistake.

I put a coin in his hand and told him to close his hand around it.  What did he do?  He immediately opened it.  Trick ruined.  Luckily I was able to stop other people from seeing so this one spectator didn't ruin it for everyone.

**edit 2:** If you're interested in joining, you'll need to convince a moderator that you have some knowledge of magic. You can upload a video of you performing (**make sure that your reddit username is clearly visible or stated in the video**) or upload a picture of your magic library (again, **with your name included in the picture** and make sure your *library* is more than just a single effect DVD from ellusionist). If you don't own a webcam or digital camera, you can borrow a smartphone to take a photo or video. We prefer video, but will usually accept a photo. Alternatively, you can devise your own method of convincing us beyond a doubt that you already have a foundation in magic.

You're welcome to speculate about effects on YouTube, propose and debate methods for created plots, and almost anything else. The exceptions - Do not expose any new effect that is currently marketed or any ""signature"" effects of prominent magicians. [Copperfield's Portal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZJVWXb92gA) comes to mind as an example of that.

I don't really do much in r/magic (as a mod) other than make sure the spam filter isn't overly aggressive and occasionally post a reminder that this is an open forum. I'd hope to not do anything at all at r/magicsecrets. You just show up and post pretty much whatever you want. With that in mind, it's not a public subreddit. It's set to private.

As I mentioned [in the other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Magic/comments/n55kd/how_about_a_closed_inviteonly_subreddit_for/), I'm not sure how active such a subreddit would actually be. There were enough upvotes for it, so I figured I'd just go ahead and create it. If you're interested in being added, just send me a message.

**edit 3:** If you send me a message for application, make sure it's complete. I will completely ignore messages that don't have what I asked. The requirements are very simple, but about 90% of the messages I get are slipshod half-assed messages about this subreddit. I will not be taking extra steps or, honestly, putting in even the slightest amount of extra effort to get you into /r/magicsecrets. I will read your message, look at your picture, or watch your video. If you send me a message asking what kind of proof I need, you will be totally ignored. If you want me to fill out the fields on your website, you will be totally ignored. You want to join the subreddit, you should put forth the effort. I'm not asking for anything difficult. I reject the majority of the applications because either 1) there's absolutely no proof that the reddit account belongs to the same person as the website/youtube account that you linked and 2) owning three decks of cards does not make you a magician. If you're interested in joining /r/magicsecrets, please read the second edit again, *then* send me a message."	t5_2qh74	True

Jon recently lectured at my local IBM ring and I got to see the whole routine up close and buy it from him personally. The DVD comes with two gimmicks, they are both easy to work with and I will make it known that they do not use magnets or shimmed cards, and the trick can be done with a borrowed deck. 

The first gimmick can be used by anyone and is used for Jon Armstrongs routine which closes with the spectator cutting to their card.This Routine is brilliant, the prop makes it funny but the magic is fantastic. The first plunger can pick up multiple cards, pick up the whole deck, a thought of number of cards, and find a signed selected card with almost no effort. YOU CAN DO THIS TRICK IN ONLY A FEW MINUTES

The second plunger was designed by Matthieu Bich and has all the same abilities but the spectator cannot pick up even a single card with it. The gimmick is great but in my opinion Matthieu's routine is poor.

This trick is immediately funny and gathers the attention of all audiences. I have used it on laymen in the magic shop where I work and have gotten great reactions. I highly recommend it.

If you have any questions on the product i'd be happy to help."	t5_2qh74	True
1369190147.0	1et4tu	The decline of magic in mainstream media in the USA?	Nexious	13	0	13	"I think back to the 1990s. Every month there seemed to be another magic special on television--often in prime time on a broadcast network like ABC. Many featured great magicians and top acts.  World's Greatest Magic, Great Magic of Las Vegas, Lance Burton specials, David Copperfield specials, David Blaine specials, Penn &amp; Teller's Sin City Spectacular, Ricky Jay's special on HBO, etc...  The same could be said about the 80s and 70s with Doug Henning and others.

Why then, does it seem like we've run dry of new magic specials this decade?  Sure David Blaine specials are repeated ad nauseam, but there sure doesn't seem to be much new content produced.  There was the Criss Angel fad but that's about it.  The last actual series of magic specials I recall were on the obscure MyNetworkTV channel and were a mix of ""Magic's Biggest Secrets Revealed"" and some other very low budget series with some seriously poor acts. That was also five years ago.

Am I missing out on some new stuff or is there really not much out there anymore? I realize other countries like the UK don't seem to be in such a drought, with some recent series that were devoted to magic like P&amp;T's ""Fool Us"" and ""The Magicians"". 

(This also reminds me that I have about 20 tapes of TV magic specials from the 90s I recorded that I really should transfer as I'm sure they're past their peak)."	t5_2qh74	True
1368992496.0	1enb3x	My Number 1 Bar Set. Routine. As Promised	Jokers247	18	3	5	"Background: I work at a fine dining bistro and it has a small bar where i do magic. When appetizers are ordered it usually takes about 10-12 minutes for the food to arrive. So my goal was to have a routine to entertain while partrons waited for their food. i also wanted to use effects that were completely different from the previous effect. This isnt the end all be all of bar routines, but it is a very strong working act that my guests love.  

Routine: Chop Cup, Shot Glass Coins Across, My Favorite Card Trick.  
Run time: Aprox 8-10 min.  

Ill be brief on my presentation as i feel presentation shoud be unique to each performer. i will give my thoughts on props used, routining of effects, resourcing, and why i think they work.  

Chop Cup: I usually open by saying ""are you familiar with the cups and balls? (quick explanation). i remember the first time i saw this trick i was 5 years old and the magician who performed it actually gave me one of the balls. i still carry it around to this day (bring in the ball). ive always wanted to do this trick but sadly i dont own a set of cups; so i looked around the bar to see what i could make do with and what i have is: a shot glass, bottom of a martini shaker, and a napkin""  
The chop cup routine i do is a combination of Don Alan, Larry Jennings, and my own thoughts. I open with Don Alans explanation, do my thing, go into Larry Jennings' shot glass chop cup effect and close by using Don Alan. This is a great opener and it is so powerful. Doing this behind a bar makes the end so easy.  
Materials: I own a few chop cups but the one i use at the bar is the Ickle Pickle wide mouth cup because it looks like the base of a mini martini shaker. Shot Glass, Napkin (i use a 18 inch purple silk, i like the contrast of the silk and ball).  
Resources: Worlds Greatest Magic DVD on Chop Cup, and The Complete Don Alans Chop Cup booklet by Ron Bauer (a must own for chop cup wokers. Both resources can be bought for 30 dollars total) .  

Shot Glass Coins Across: This is a visual out of the hands,mostly, coins across. The coins are placed ,stepped, on the bar and covered by the shotglass. one by one the coins disappear from under the shot glass and end up in your hand. The last coin you make disappear and all four coins end up in the spectators hand (the final coin travel is similar to David Roths classic). I love coins across effects especially ones that involve a spectator. This effect is so visual since the audience can see the coins actually disappear under the shot glass. It also makes sense to me since you have a shot glass in play from the previous chop cup routine. Shaun uses a holdout for the last vanish but a holdout doesnt work for me. I am in the process of buying a tko 2.0 which will clean up the ending a bit.  
Materials: 4 coins, a coin gaff (which if youre famiiliar with coins across effects you know the gaff and it is something most coin workers will already have), the shot glass from the chop cup.  
Resource: Shaun Robison's Penguin Live Lecture. Shaun is a woker and I am planning on reviewing this lecture at some point. But let me just say it is really great if youre a restaurant, bar, table hopper, strolling magician.  

My Favorite Card Trick aka The Chicago Quadopener.  
After years of performing numerous high caliber card tricks the one trick that consistently get some of the greatest audience reactions is just the standard simple version of the chicago opener. This is the chicago opener on steroids and it kills. It has a color changing deck, the chicago opener with a few phases and closes with a rainbow deck...I cant praise this effect enough.  
Materials: youll need a few things one being a rainbow deck. I use the spectrum deck (its expensive but worth it).
Resoureces: Super Charged Classics Vol.1 by Mark James (dvd).  

performances of the Chicago Quadopener and Don Alans Chop cup have been posted recently so theyre probably still on the first or second page. 

That is my number one set. three distinct tricks that with the right patter flow very nicely with one another. Working behind a bar makes certain aspects of the tricks that much easier. i also use a 7 by 12.5 inch close up pad.  
This set works for me and my performance style. The tricks are workers and each effect is incredibly powerful. I hope you Enjoyed reading this. I also appologize for any grammar errors.  

If you have any questions just let me know and ill do my best to help you out. "	t5_2qh74	True

I've watched a million and a half videos, and worked on just about as many tricks. I've lost many hours to these damned things.. And it gets to the point where (as arrogant as this whole thing sounds) I started doing things just in order to challenge myself. That's why I'm such a move monkey; it gives me a challenge. Being a move monkey, however, is more of a personal thing.. I get self satisfaction out of it, and little more than that. It's become magical masturbation.

A while ago, I started thinking about ways to challenge myself that would actually benefit my magic. I came up with an idea, tossed it to a few friends, but quickly dropped it and went on to other things. I remembered it and told Strat about it the other night, and he's encouraged me to do it.. So here I am.

Basically, my plan is to have you guys name card effects, and link to a video of it.. It can be a trick you find cool, a trick you find technically challenging, or something thats fooled you. As long as it's not a flourish, and its not gimmicked, it's fair game. (Note: I will prioritize anything that is non-table based. I don't tend to work on a table, and I do plan on working on things to add to my repertoire first and foremost... I also suck at table work..)

My job is to take that trick that you post, work on it for half an hour (I'll film that entire half hour with a timer beside me and then timelapse it so you know I didnt cheat) and then at the end of the half hour, I get one shot to do the trick, and I post whatever happens. You guys will get to see me work on things, screw up, get frustrated, and have a good time.

The objective here is that at the end of this (whenever it does end) I have a few effects that are cool, and I can work on to use. Basically it pushes me to become better, all the while entertaining you guys (hopefully).

So get on it! Send in those videos and lets see what I can do.

Cheers.

Note: I'm doing this same thing on a forum elsewhere, so I will cross post any videos I get from there as well. "	t5_2qh74	True

I was practicing my Elmsley's Count for the ""Twisting the Aces"" trick a little while ago, and while I was pulling off the ""second card"" I thought I had mucked up the trick. I was frustrated since I had gone quite a while without messing up, but I stopped what I was doing to reset the cards when I noticed that instead of messing up the trick I had actually pulled off the double lift without even myself noticing.

     It was poker night at the bar down the street from me tonight. I played some cards. Afterwards, I showcased a few of my better tricks.  I had everyone howling laughing because they were telling me someone already did a few tricks like ""pick a card, Ill guess your card"".   Easy shit.  They were even saying they had an idea how he was doing the trick.

 Well, if it weren't for this subreddit, I wouldn't have learned how to expand by using passes and lifts and what not.  So my quick 6 trick routine that I showcased had everyone laughing and screaming ""WTF!?  Just tell us one!""

Made me realize something.  The joy of magic nowadays is not that I can understand the concept or idea employed, rather I analyze how well someone else pulls it off and compliment when deserved. But the joy and happiness that people experience makes it so great.  Hearing and enjoying their responses was absolutely wonderful.  The fact that someone paid my tab because I entertained him so well just made my night.

I do see now that it is time for me to graduate from being a card person and it's time to acquire coin skills.  Time to read the FAq on that.  Should you care to respond, please PM a message towards easy confidence building coin tricks so I can gain at least the desire to expand my bag.

Again, thank you for pushing me to better my sleight and showmanship.  I am grateful for this community.

Regards, 
The Ogre

He's down on his luck, has been in prison and doesn't want to go back but his lifestyle is turning him in that direction. 

I suggested to him that he take up something that really fascinates and interests him, which after years of practicing magic on him he wants to take it up also.

When I told him about 'Royal Road' I was shocked to hear that he can't read. He REALLY doesn't want to head back to his old life, but I don't know where to go and I honestly cannot find anymore time to give him lessons often as he needs to.

I was going to suggest to him ""Daryl's Ambitious Card DVD"", but he is an ABSOLUTE beginner and thought he ought to have a foundation in just card handling. 

I showed him the basics of how hold cards:

* Mechanics/Dealers Grip
* Overhand; Hindu and Riffle Shuffle (No Controlling as of yet)
* Dealing cards one at a time (Surprisingly, I found alot of people think the left hand does nothing while dealing; I showed him that the left thumb pushes one card out for the right hand to take)

EDIT: Layout and grammar.

EDIT2: Thanks everyone for the suggestions; it hasn't crossed my mind that there are DVDs to accompany or even replace the books that I know well. I would have shown him DVDs from Ellusionist, Theory11, Penguin etc., but like before, I don't think those are suitable for absolute beginners.

Some of the tricks require gaffs but then he describes how to do a version of the same trick ungaffed.  

Anything by John Bannon...seriously,anything. His books are out of print but if you can get them you should. (Impossibilia is in e-book form)
Dear. Mr. Fantasy by Bannon: Arguably this is the greatest card book to come out in the past 25 years. Not only are the tricks superb but theyre also layed out as full routines. In chapter three he takes a break from the traditional magic book formula and writes tricks in the form of a narrative. I loved this writing style. Beyond Fabulous is in my number 1 formal close up set and it is incredibly impressive. The best trick in the book is probably Dead Reckoning. How does someone come up with something like this. Its incredible and nearly self working.  
Smoke and Mirrors by Bannon: I love love love this book. This is the first Bannon book i came across and i was instantly hooked. The quality of his material is top notch and of an intermediate magic level. There are other effects besides cards in this book. His CSB routine is the one i use. I have probably gone through and am familiar with a half doezen CSB routines and this one is the baby bear of them all...its just right.  
Impossibilia by Bannon: His first and most varied book. There are cards, coins, chopcup...etc. This book can be found on LL Publishings ebooks for a good price. It also includes his version of triumph wich is one of the finest triumphs around.   
If you enjoy great close up you have to check out Bannon  

One Degree by John G: One of the best card books to come out recently. I have been familar with Johns magic long before he made his dvds. Its great to see the cream of the crop get put into book form. The quality of card magic in this book is top notch. Much like Bannon this is easily accesible for someone of an intermediate range. I cant really praise this book enough, it is truly a modern classic. Vino Aces is my parlor act closer. I do atleast four tricks from this book on a regular basis.  

The Card Magic of Nick Trost: This is a very special book and maybe one of the most underrated card books around. Nick Trost took some of the greatest card tricks and card concepets around and re-tooled them so that almost all of the sleights are removed. Thats right, there is very little sleight of hand in this book. His magic focuses on subtlety over sleights. This book is great for a beginner but the magic is of a professional level. I do to many tricks out of this book to list them all but his Spectator Card trick (my version of it) holds a special place in my heart.  

Strong Magic by Dawrin Ortiz: This is a book on magic theory and performance ideas. Its great. It will make you a better magician if you read it and critically think about what is being presented to you. The fist chapter on clarity should be a must read for all magicians.  

Totally Out of Control by Chris Kenner: This book is crazy. Its funny. Its odd. Its full of great visual magic. This book covers all sorts of magic: cards, coins, bands....Its awesome. The coin stuff can be a bit tough but it is woth it. This has the original three fly in it.  

The Big Boys:  

Art of Astonishment: Paul Harris is one of my all time favorite close up magicians. This has all of his original books and then some in a 3 volume set. Get these books. The magic is great and his writing style is very witty. The volumes cover all sorts of close up magic with all sorts of traditional and weird objects.  

Apocalypse by Harry Lorayne and Kaufman (volume 1): I only own volume one and thats because this is one intimidating book. Its got so much magic that it can and will make your head spin. I wont go into the backstory of Apocalypse but its got effects from some of the greatest close up magicians of its time. Its got something for everything but youre going to have to find it.  

Collected Almanac by Richard Kaufman: If you like Apocalypse youll love the almanac. Its similar in style to Apocalypse and is also intimidating. Its got a great write up in the beginning that covers the history of Richards Almanac.  
What make Apocalypse and the Almanac great are their index sections. without these  these books would almost be impossible to navigate.  

Definitive Sankey Series: Jay Sankey has come out with hits and misses in his career. This book is full of the hits and there are about 500 of them. With time these will be looked at in the same way as the AoA series.

In particular I've really been enjoying card magic, close up tricks and even those guys that do that ""poker magic,"" as I call it, where it's amazing card control or counting or something.  So I thought to myself, I'd love to do this.  I'm thirty, and the other day a guy at work showed me a simple color change.  You know the one, make the rubbing move and boom, new card.  And I squealed like a girl.  It was great!  He also showed me something called the ""Cybil Cut,"" but I've come to learn this is only related to magic in the most ethereal way.  Which is to say, not a whole lot.  Anyways....

Either I'm missing something, or I'm missing something.  I keep seeing this thing happen, over and over, and it's really confusing.  Here's a short list:

*  No exposure!
*  Read books about magic.
*  Don't read books about magic, it's cheating.
*  Everyone on YouTube is a dumb kid, they can't *really* do magic.
*  Every magician is a hack, or doing it in the wrong style, unless it suits my taste.
*  Not even Chris Angel has value as a magician, even if it ushers in a new generation of fledgling magicians.
*  Who wants fledgling magicians anyways?  There is no possible way they may care about the deep and rich history of magic, the work it takes, and the time that must be put in.
*  All magicians are amazingly talented puzzle solvers, and any magician worth his weight in rabbits figured out the tricks on his own.

So what's the scoop?  I know that I must certainly be wrong here, or at least I hope I am.  I love the fact that a lie can make a 30 year old grown man giggle like a girl with excitement.  So what's really happening behind the scenes?  I want to learn this craft, I want to care about the history, but it's really disconcerting when every other interest I've ever had has been built with some expected sharing.

Now, I get it to a degree, you came up with some beautiful illusion all on your own, maybe you spent years on it.  I get that.  It's yours, and you have something to gain by keeping it.  But there is more to it than that.

So what does the new guy do?  What do I do?  And yes, this question is both philosophical and practical in nature."	t5_2qh74	True

1372635418.0	1he52g	Sunday Essay: Importance of Failure.	RC-Roi92	16	4	5	"Hey Guys, last night I had a gig as a guitar player (I’m not a guitarist by any definition of the word) and I learned a valuable lesson. To be completely honest I messed up, badly. My chords got mixed up and without proper notation I had nowhere else to go, and nowhere to hide. It was horrible to fail in front of 200 people all at once and all I could do was sweat and think about the singer who’s frantically trying to hold a note even though it seemed like I was trying my best to keep her off it. So last night while pounding my steering wheel, I started thinking about what I could have done to have prevented that disastrous ear rape.

First of; I didn’t practice anywhere near enough, the singer had arrived that morning and the only thing I had done up to that point was play through the song twice. So I came completely unprepared and when we got together it was frankly obvious that we were underprepared. 

Secondly; I was cocky thinking that if I can remember the chords sitting at home without  stage and sweat, then I’ll be able to do the same on stage. I’m betting that the feeling is a known one, where you think you’ve practiced enough but when in the spotlight (be it an actual spotlight or just the eyes of two spectators) the story tells a different tale. 

Thirdly; I didn’t print out the chords for the songs, being the wanker that I am, I felt like I didn’t “need” the chords, and that I could remember the songs without a hitch, which was wrong, very very, very, wrong.

So what can we learn from my failure as a guitarist? Well the most obvious thought is practice, practice, practice. It’s so important to know the moves while blindfolded upside down about to be submerged into a water tank. You think that you know it’s; double lift, glide, control. But when that day comes when you've forgotten to keep that break and the card is seemingly lost forever you’ll get mad at yourself for not giving the trick the attention it deserved. 

Something else to be learned is to always stack the odds in your favour, be it a stacked deck, an accomplice or even, dare I say it, a stooge. Do anything to help you save the show.

The last and maybe most important thing to gather from this mess is experience. Something happens from experience that cannot be learned with a mirror, you get the knowledge to know what to do when things go south. The best magicians are so good you’ll never know when they've lost their break or worse, because they’ll always have a way out, be it a card to wallet, a cull or an invisible deck.

Come prepared, become experienced and amaze.

The response has been great; I really love how the discussions have evolved throughout the weeks. Some have really opened my mind and changed my perception, which is really what these essays were meant for. I would like to make clear that these are my opinions and not meant as any kind of new groundbreaking formula for magic.


“Artists erase reality to a greater or lesser extent, and substitute their own reality - created by their brains, instead” - **Semir Zeki**

On the hunt for a quote I once read about inviting reality into you art, I instead stumbled over this one. The quote describes the job of the artist - one which is in constant change. From decade to decade the artist has had many hats, from showing reality, to changing reality, to expressing himself, to expressing yourself.

In Aristotle’s *Poetics*, art is defined as the replication and perfection of reality. Mimesis is of utmost importance to this. Mimesis means to imitate and, through imitation, reach a release in emotion (Catharsis). 

But this is an explanation of art in the sense of the two storytelling genres: tragedy and, at least to a certain extent, comedy. So how does this apply to magic? What is it that we should take away from this definition? 

For me, the imitation part is what in particular interests me. I feel like I see so much magic that has lost touch with reality, magic based on visual gimmicks instead of human desire. But, really, is finding a card truly magical? Or is it just an impossible feat that you achieve?

Magic comes from desires within: flying, love, wealth, vanishing, and so on. A classic question for magicians is: “If you really could do magic, what would you do?” And it still holds up. What would you make or vanish or create if you were an actual modern day wizard (Don’t you dare wear a robe!) 

Things that are connected with our reality have a greater effect on us. To make your problems disappear in a puff of smoke is a desire everyone has had. So when we create magic we should try to infuse it with some reality. Do everything we can to resemble reality for as long as we can, so that when we do change reality, it’s so unexpected and impossible that you’ll create a lasting impression. 

The quote I was looking for was something along the lines of “The more reality you invite into your art, the better is your chance at manipulating it”. The quote says more than I ever can. It is so fitting for magic, that we have to create something actually relevant and believable to our audience. 


It’s really about making your magic relevant to your spectator’s reality, then melting their reality and forging something special out of it.

She learned most of them &amp; has really enjoyed learning magic tricks.  

Last summer, she even saw a magician at the local library and both of my kids just LOVED the show.  It got me thinking that perhaps she could have a few ""real"" magic trick props like the pros use (silk hankie?  foam balls?)  Nothing too elaborate.  

I just know nothing about magic.  I'd love to get her a couple of ""classic"" magic trick props/items .... but want to make sure that it's something that she could actually do with a little practice.

1345832174.0	yrlb9	An excerpt from Pure Effect:  it defines us... 	ForceUser7	13	4	5	"Life.  Anything else, my weary friends, is touched by the swollen hand of Onan.  There is one word to describe our general approach to our art, and that one word is 'auto-erotic obsession.'  We all know it.  As we shuffle our little decks in the privacy of our rooms, or (for some) in the thrill of the open club-house, our magic books become our pornography, our full-length mirrors become our full-length mirrors, and fanning powder really comes into its own.  Furtive, frantic delights that beget nothing.  Choose life, ladies and gentlemen; choose, my petals, life.  We are arch-creators in a world of wonder and the unfurlors of surprise.  We can take people to the edge of their representation of this world and let them glimpse the dark, screaming abyss where their understanding runs out.  We present a metaphor: that the map is not the territory, the menu is not the meal, that the interpretation of an event is not the event itself.  And as we teach, we learn this for ourselves.  And we can make it clearer for others.  And somewhere in that lesson is wonder, and somewhere in that cocoon of wonder lies a tiny, mewling, perfect miracle.

Two days ago, I had yet another gig, this time with two songs. Now, seeing as I had learned a bit from last week, I decided to play one of the same songs—the one of the two that went over the best. So, I had one known song, and then I needed another song, which ended up being ‘Get Lucky’ by Daft Punk, because it’s a simple progression and therefore easier to not mess up. And it was all smooth sailing; nothing really went wrong, and we had a great time. But the days leading up to it were not as fun, at all. 

We (being me and my girlfriend) decided on doing this gig Wednesday, and chose songs for it and started practicing and arranging it to sound okay for a small acoustic set. This was all well and good, and we practiced for a few hours, and everything was doing fine, but suddenly there’s this weird mood change. You guys may have tried it yourselves, but suddenly all you can think about is how much you suck, how everything sucks; you’re not prepared, you’re not supposed to be here, and you should just be in bed. So generally pretty negative thoughts enter your mind, and this is where the hippie comes in; you have to keep those negative thoughts in check, so they don’t ruin everything. It happens in a blink of an eye that those thoughts just destroy everything you’ve fought so hard for—not because they erase your skills, but rather make you undermine yourself. 

So these thoughts make you doubt your own ability, but where do they come from? I’m not entirely sure, but in my own experience, it often comes from excessive practice. The type of practice where all the fun is sucked out of it and what you’re left with is just procedural madness? That’s a killer for me, when I’ve practiced so hard for so long that I almost feel like giving up. The bad thoughts keep creeping into your head, making you think, “it’s so obvious that I’m about to do a move!” or make you doubt if you’ll be funny or not. Now if time is not an issue, then at this time it’s a good idea to change pace and do something else, be it rewriting a particular line or thinking about another routine or walking your dog; it’s good to back out of the stress-zone and start loving your hobby again, whether it’s guitar or magic. 

Just push through it. Either you’ll get over the thoughts, or you’ll drive to the gig feeling miserable. But no matter what—and this is so important—get on that stage and do your very, very best. More often than not, those thoughts are there when they have no reason to. You’ll often do better and work better when pressured, and that’s why having the muscle memory to do so is vital. 

So I’m running out of space and time (hopefully it’s still Sunday somewhere). I’ll return next week with a more in-depth discussion on the subject.

I've been adding a few things that seem to me like they'll be beneficial, let me know what you think! 

First, I'd like to remind everyone that we have user flair. If you look over to the right, you'll see ""Show my flair on this reddit. It looks like:""

If you hit ""edit"" next to your name, it will give you some options on what picture you want to show up next to your name. This looks nice, but also helps give context to your posts.

Second, I've added link flair as well! That means that when you submit a post, you can then click ""Flair"" below the post, and that will give it a tag that everyone can see on the main page. Right now, we have the tags ""Cards"", ""Coins"", and ""Feedback?"" The first two are a bit self-explanatory, apply them to any questions or discussions about cards or coins. The third is for when you want comments on a video of your magic, or whatever else you may be posting.

Those are the only three we have right now, but I'm definitely open to suggestions for new ones if you guys think of some that will be helpful.

***

I'm not a big fan of making changes just for the sake of prettiness, I've added these because I think they'll add to the functionality of /r/Magic, if you think they detract in some way, or can think of other ways to make it better, let me know!

Kevtron	10	1	23	"I started learning a few years ago, and then moved my whole life and kinda forgot about magic :(  I still have a couple card tricks that work ok, but don't really want to come off as a 'magician'.  I just want to play with drunk people, and maybe get a free drink :P

The best thing I have are my loops which no one guesses, and allows a lot of other opportunities.  I think coin tricks would be a good way to go (so I picked up Bobo).  But what other manipulations are good for that context?  Maybe cigarette magic (any suggestions on a resource for that other than youtube?) for example.

Clearly I don't mind using some effects (like my loops), but a) want to keep it cheap and b) think pure slights are more fun.

I'm relatively new to card magic, and recently decided to step up my game a little bit. To do so I've been teaching myself both the classic and invisible turnover passes. I thoroughly enjoy the theory and method behind these moves, but I often get frustrated when practicing in front of my mirror. Watching my own hands, I almost always see the movements of my left hand, which kinda blows the whole move.

Hugard and Braue's Expert Card Technique says little about the proper angle of presentation for the Invisible Turnover, and I've been told that I'll ""get"" the angle for the classic pass with practice. While I understand that practice is necessary/paramount/the whole point I'm having difficulties making the necessary adjustments to hide the inner workings of the movements.

Can any more experienced card mechanics give advice, or share their learning experiences with these moves?"	t5_2qh74	True

A lot of responses expressed a desire to learn magic. I intend to get around to making more posts about other topics in the coming weeks, but I have to start somewhere. Since I'm primarily a card guy, I'll start with this! I'll either compile the responses to add to an FAQ, or I'll link directly to this thread in the sidebar of r/magic.

What are some titles of resources for learning card magic? Along with a title, please post why you think it's a good resource and what skill level it would be for. Example:

The Classic Collection (book, in two volumes) by Harry Lorayne is for people with a small amount of experience with cards. It's not good as an introductory text since Harry often says things like, ""use your favorite false cut."" He does teach some sleights in the series - some double lifts, false cuts, forces, and a few other moves - but this book isn't about learning movies; it's about using them. These books are filled with effect after effect. Most of the content was original published by Harry in the 60's, but he's added commentary for how the effects have been used over the decades and how they've evolved. He also credits other magicians' ideas and references similarities between his work and that of some other magicians in case you want to research more about those ideas.

He teaches a wide variety of concepts, from self-working to requiring perfect faros, from math-based to force-based. You're not going to use everything from the book in the real world, but you'll probably learn a lot of things that you like."	t5_2qh74	True

1369608884.0	1f3sk4	Sunday Essay: What are you saying with your magic?	RC-Roi92	10	2	10	"Hey guys, a few of you might know me. I’ve been on here from time to time, voicing popular opinions and generally being an asshole to anyone performing card magic. Seeing as /r/magic is building up buzz again, thanks to a few active members, I thought I’d try and do a weekly essay on magic. Some of them will be about technique, some about performance and some about theory. The idea with these essays is not having them be the final word on a subject, but rather for them to spark discussion and make that thing between your ears do some work And a [plug](http://www.vanishingincmagic.com/magic-downloads/free-magic-downloads/magic-in-mind/) to Magic in Mind, something that should be required reading for every magician. It’s a collection of various essays by the best thinkers in magic. 

Before we dive too deep into this subject, I want to draw a parallel between magic and music. What is music/magic composed of? The major components of music/magic are: 

•	Chords/Sleights

•	Melody/Effect

•	Lyrics/Patter

•	Performance/Guess what 

So, like music, the sleights we use can be used for many melodies. Our effect has to fit our lyrics. But why then does music touch the spectator on a deeply emotional level, yet magic leaves us with a puzzled feeling? Why is it that music can make us cry and love every moment of it, while magic can only make us leap to illogical conclusions? 

I have a confession to make: I have a love/hate relationship with magic. I love it to bits for what it is. I love the impossible; to be able to live surrealism in our realistic world is the most amazing thing ever. What I hate is how people perceive it. They find it childish and, to a certain degree, dumb. And whose fault is that? It is, of course, our own. Somewhere something happened where magicians around the world thought it would be enough to do the moves and say the patter (a matter for another essay), and we’d be golden. Sure, Uncle Bob at Thanksgiving is going to be really popular with the kids when he’s doing the 21 card trick, but we’re artists (hah!); we need to carry a message. 

This is where I want you to think about why you became a magician. For me it was that one single amazing moment of astonishment. Paul Harris makes the point in AoA that the purest form of magic, and one of the purest forms of art, is that second when your reality crumbles and you let it dissipate. But if we’re being honest, it only lasts a few moments before our brains starts looking for explanations as to how this dissonance in reality came to be. 

Sure I’ll give you that the moment of astonishment is absolutely one of the best feelings in the world, and it’s a noble goal to pursue as a magician. Music has that lasting quality: the ability to change the mood of the entire evening in 4 minutes. The only way I see a magician do that is if he punches the DJ. 

In my opinion (I knew it would sneak into this thing), you need to create a message, something that’s unique to you. You want to become unique and original, but more importantly, you will express yourself and your views, which is in some ways the essence of art.

Monarchs are my current favorite. These cards are amazing. The feel and the way they handle are top quality. They farro perfectly. They arent cheap, around 7 dollars a deck. The card box is the best card box i have ever seen. The cards are gorgeous, i love the back design, and pretty much everything about them. Theory11 hit this one out of the park.

Wouldn't a simple solution be to create a private, hidden subreddit which requires you to answer some questions (like The Learned Pig Project) or something to prove that you are indeed a student of magic and privy to the knowledge of methods?

Of course, this place would still disallow sharing of tricks that are not considered ""public domain"", but it would allow magicians to talk more openly without risking exposure..

This would mean some more work for the mods of course, but if some more mods were invited, maybe it wouldn't be too much work...

Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing your op opinions,

I've been doing card magic for a number of years, and I feel like I'm becoming desensitized to it.  I feel like all of my tricks are blurred together, as if they are just the same few effects done a little differently.

So what I'm wondering is... what amazes spectators the most?  I know transpositions, instant changes, etc., are ""big""... but like, somehow it all feels the same.

Does any of this make sense?  Essentially, I want to be able to create new card effects without feeling like I'm doing something I've done before.  Are there any untapped effects that magicians have been wanting to do in cards but never have?

Despite it being one of the biggest parts of my character, magic is actually not the career that I am aiming towards. I am actually studying to be a Highschool Mathematics teacher and I'm currently on my final internship.

During this time, I'm learning much more about teaching and managing students in a classroom (Which btw has become a little bit easier by bribing my students with magic tricks at the end of the lesson if they finish work well and early).

However, during lunch times students who also practice magic have heard that I perform and ask if I can teach them. Some who are far more skilled than I in the technical sides of things, some complete beginners with basic card handling under their belt. What I have to offer each of the students at different levels range from improving sleight-of-hand, angles, managing crowds, performing, audience engagement etc.
It all depends on what level they're at.

What started as a lunch time magic jam with a few students, has turned into organized classes where I instruct them on basic card mechanics which they supplement with their own practice at home (I ensure that the students I teach have Royal Road, Card College, or the DVD equivalents; as well as any other resource that tells me they are learning elsewhere to supplement what I teach them.)

I began organizing them into skill groups so that I could focus on particular topics on given days. I also began giving them homework to practice. I started thinking about what I should teach next...and essentially everything I would do if I'd be teaching any other subject.

It had me thinking...""Could 'Magic' become a high school subject? Could it be like any of the other performing arts subjects like Art, Drama and Music?""

Personally I think it could and I've thought out how I would limit how many people I taught; the skill range and dedication they need to demonstrate before being allowed more secrets; the order of the moves/skills are taught. Not only that, but the theory involved behind magic and the discussions on 'effects of technology in magic', 'television magic', 'gimmicks vs. sleights', 'why people enjoy magic' and a whole range more.

I think this might be quite a bit more tangible than previous Sunday essays, but the thoughts are sound IMO. 

First of, great job of trying to draw other interests into your magic, that's a crucial step toward becoming more than just a trick monkey. 
I think this is an excellent example of the decline of the art behind the magic. Why do you want a store bought trick rather than one of your own creations? I buy as much material as any other guy(probably more) but the thing is that if we continue to perform the same effects with the same presentation we'll become uncreative and destroy the art. Just to make this clear, this is nothing against OP or any magician in particular. I just find it weird that while the entire music industry strives to be original(and not rely solely on playing cover songs). We're stuck on doing covers of one another, and while we can do a really great cover, it will never really be our story to tell.
Rant off, lets do something with this question that will actually help you OP :) I'm not sure what environment you're performing in but let's just say you're a table hopper or similar close up worker. First let's do a brainstorm(feel free to add to this list) of things to fold:

* Dollar bills, borrowed or not.

* Business Cards

* Playing Cards

* Notepad paper(I used an old Sankey effect with one of the small notepads)

* Pre-cut sheets of paper made for folding

Now we have something to fold let's think about effect. Some may argue that we shouldn't think about this first, but for restaurant work where we need to strive for thinner pockets, I think it's valid to use something we already have. So back to the effects:

The 10 theories of magic are a good starting point in my opinion:

1. Production

2. Vanish

3. Transposition

4. Transformation

5. Multiplication

6. Penetration

7. Restoration

8. Suspension

9. Levitation

10. Mentalism

Personally I love the idea of pushing life into something static. Like the Daniel Garcia butterfly effect. So something as simple as making a nice swan and then making the wings flutter just enough to make the spectator dream, would be absolutely beautiful. I think the most critical part of this whole thing is the giveaway; if you give the spectator this beautiful paper swan that actually moved just seconds ago gives them a lasting magical experience, one that they can feel again if they find it in their purse or shelf, weeks, months or even years from now.

The book is The Collected Almanac by Richard Kaufman. Ive read a bit of this book before at the Magic Castle libarary and ive always wanted a copy of my own. The Collected Almanac was a monthly newsletter from 82-86 (same style as Apocolypse). Its hard to go through 175+ effects without owning it. Im glad to finally be able to add this to my personal library. Ive been doing Darryl's Cut to Kill from this book for awhile.  

The first dvd is Small Miracles by Helder Guimares. This is some top notch card magic. Helder is a FISM champion and this dvd shows why. Atleast two of the effects, of the 9, are immediately going into my close up set; parts of his reset and the blank deck routine. He has a very nice oil and water, a triumph/4king producing/color changing deck routine, a fantastic out of this world, and the last trick on the dvd is mind blowing. This isnt for begginers but should be in the range of intermediate to light advanced. Some tricks alao use gaffs, which i have no problem with. Gaffs not included.  

The second dvd is 21 Magic by Sweeden. This may be the best looking magic dvd around. The production value and visuals are practically movie quality. It has 10 magicians each doing around three tricks a piece. This ranges from: cards, card techniques, ring and ripe, coin moves, sleeving, bottle production...etc. the magicians are fantastic and im sure someone would find atleast three to four things that would interest them. Standouts for me so far are the: 2 ring and rope moves, a false shuffle, and a magicians force type trick...and thats just on the first dvd.  

With the few hits and many misses in magic i was so happy to get three quality items at the same time....i also got two little card wallets because you can never have enough of them.

In one in particular he produces a [big old bagette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=N--a2OuPLok#t=4m45s) from his bare hands. Now either I'm out of touch with what the new generation of magicians can do or this isn't workable live!

So it got me wondering - how much editting is too much editting? Is it ethical to edit if it's in the context of a dual-reality effect and we pick the best POV? Should we only ever show what someone in an actual audience would see? In which case should it be the best placed member or the worse placed? Can we omit pre-show legitimately for some reason? Or should it all go in, pre-show and all? If pre-show is too tedious and we just want the meat of an effect is it ethical to also cut out parts of an effect when a magician might cop something, or perform a get-ready in some other way?

It's easy to say 'no editting' at all but as we can see it's not just down to a choice of editting but also who's point of view to show to the TV audience as it being 'live'. It's a tricky call.

Still I call bullshit on this Yif guy."	t5_2qh74	True

I'm returning to magic after a 25+ year absence. My son is 12 and is very interested in magic, especially in coin magic.
We discovered that we both seem to have the same basic problem; both of us are unable to do certain types of palming. He, because his hands are small, me because that many years of holding a hammer (I'm a blacksmith) have left me without much fine dexterity.
I cannot do any backpalming, or any palm switch (the one where you have a coin classic palmed, and then change a coin with your middle finger back there)
He's having real trouble with the classic palm, but the thumb palm is easy enough for him and he can do a downs palm with one coin.

So, does anyone know of any good, routines or illusions that don't rely too heavily on gaffed coins (I have quite a few good ones) or on complicated palms?
I've spend several hundred dollars now on tricks from places like Ellusionist, theory 11 and the Blue Crown that I cannot perform simply because of my own physical limitations.

And how should that rule be interpreted. At the moment I delete tutorial videos, and comments threads leading to exposure. So at the moment I will allow a link to a video with the title: ""How is this done?!"". If you then ask ""How do I do that?!"" I won't do anything. More often than not people will give some helpful pointers about, and I'll just leave it be. If people start posting actual answers I try to delete them quickly. If there are no helpful comments, I'll delete the question and the answers. Am I to lenient?

Thirdly a small update. At the moment we are number 8 if you search for magic! Hurray! Just a few spots below the My Little Pony Conspiracy theory sub! That's not to bad. 

But of course, we always need to look forward. One day we want to overcome the Dodgers sub! So my last question is, how can we do that? I'm open to all suggestions. What do you think would make this sub even better?

This have made the amount of spam increase (even if the community have been good at downvoting them), and some unfortunate people have been caught in the spam filter for ages.

So here I am, the new sheriff in town. I wont make any big changes here for the time being, but I believe I'm the most active mod at the moment so if there are anything you can send me a message (or a mod mail).

And to make this post not a complete waste of bandwidth I'll ask for some input. Anything you want changed? Any good ideas about how to make this a better place?

I have thought about making some sort of flair (card, coin, illusions, etc. Maybe even a pro tag, for people who can prove they're actually pros). Would that be at all interesting?

EDIT: I would also be open to changing the rules, if anyone is unhappy. The no exposure thing isn't going to change, but I might be open to banning/allowing mostly anything else (I'm for banning Piff the magic dragon videos, as they tend to crop up all the time). Any input would be appreciated. 

Secondly: I have quickly gone through all the spam, and of course I don't think I made any mistakes. If you still don't see your post please send me a message.

EDIT on the EDIT: Anything older than a few months, I didn't bother with. If you submitted something that got caught long ago, please resubmit.

Lastly (for now): If I decide to implement flair, what kind do you want? What areas of magic should I have? Or just pro, amateur, beginner?

EDIT 2: Ok, last might have been an understatement. One more thing: Any ideas for flair images? Coins and cards are logical. But what's a good image for general magic and (stage)illusions? Mentalism?"	t5_2qh74	True

I do a weird mentalist routine in which I explain to my spectators that I basically peaked into the future and know what the answer to each of the experiments (tricks) is going to be.

All my tricks are based on that, including a wicked invisible deck routine and a forced deck finale which I did a few times and which completely baffles everyone.

But each time, I have people who claim after the show that I used sleight of hands here or there, but the trick is that I barely use them.

In fact, I can't, I suffer from essential tremors: my hands shake, something which I highlight in my introduction to point that I can't even attempt to do magic (in reality, I have good control over my hands, but that's just between you and I).

So, I don't do a magic show. I do a time-travel show, and I count the odds of me succeeding as we go along.

But I've always dreamed of opening [update: I don't mean open, open, I mean near the beginning] with a simply sleight of hand trick done poorly and then explained to the spectators to show the difference between magic and mentalism.

For a while, the example I had planned was with a substituted marked match picked at random, and showing that there were two booklet of matches, but that gives way too much and can ruin future routines.

I have thought of simply using the peek and cut trick: the person picks a card, places it on top cuts, but I know what the bottom card is so I can know which card was selected.

It doesn't ruin any future tricks I do in my routine and it's pretty basic, but I am not sure if it's the best choice because from then on, they will be looking if I am checking the bottom of the pack or controlling the cuts which might ruin one or two effects.

I'm tired of magicians complaining about the perception of magicians as kids entertainers. While I too have complained that whenever I say I'm a magician the first reaction is ""Oh well my little nephew is having a birthday in a few weeks..."", I feel like the perception is what it is... so use it as an opportunity. As a professional magician I use that perception to my advantage, as a way to differentiate my services in the mind of the consumer. When I say ""Actually I'm a magician for adults"" it surprises most people and opens up a conversation about how magic is an intellectual art form. Magic for an adult event is something that most people have never heard of, which is actually a good thing. Consumers who are planning events want something unique, for them magic for adults is something unusual and memorable for their guests. For the magician it is a great marketing tool to get the word out about their services and differentiate themselves from the stereotype. This is how I stay at the top of my booking websites, I set myself apart by specifying I am an adults only close-up magician. That separates me from 90% of the other magicians out there who have branded themselves as family and kids party entertainers.

The problem is that most magicians think they can do both... You can't brand yourself as an adult magician and then have it be obvious you are doing 10 kids parties a week... although that is where the money is, it is counter productive to your argument and perpetuates the stereotype. If this is what your plan is, you have to have two very separate brand identities. 

In conclusion... stop complaining, own the stereotype, and use it as a marketing tool to get more quality, high paying, corporate and adult gigs."	t5_2qh74	True

------

I have performed magic in one form or another for nearly 20 years, the last 5 has ended up more contained as a hobby as my *real job* pays far better than my magic ever did. Although I may not always say so, I still think of magic as a true performance art.

And yet, if you ask most people to give an opinion of magicians, short of whatever closeup magician of the moment is on television, it's rarely anything good. As far as performance arts go, actors, singers, musicians tend to rank higher on the proverbial food chain. Why?

One of the most common things you will hear, especially from magicians, is the amount of bad magic that is out there. I cannot say I disagree with a large amount of bad magic being out there, but there has always been plenty of bad movies, bad singing, bad musicians, bad painters, etc. 

Imagine if all a singer had to do was adjust his voice to create sounds of varying tonality and rhythm. Or if a guitarist simply needed to pluck strings on a guitar so sound is heard. By those definitions, all singers and guitarists are successful. Look at magic, and the basic task virtually all magicians will have is *fool the audience*. 

When we fool our audience, we have minimally fulfilled our end of the bargain. But by *only* fooling our audience, we have not necessarily done a **good** job.

Once we can manage to fool our audience, we've only started, much like a guitarist that has learned to play scales has only started. 

I believe the biggest myth in magic is to believe being fooled is a positive experience. Did the guy who got scammed at 3 card monte find it a fun time? Was it great to find out your wife is cheating on you? I will take the leap of faith and say, the answer is no.

And yet, it is probably the most important task. Without fooling, we are not magicians. So, what we need to do next is soften the blow of being fooled. How do you do that? Change your patter? Reframe a presentation? Introduce a plot device? There are countless ways to tackle the issue... and I will save that for yet another thread, as this post is really about something else.

Although our main job is to fool the audience, there must be something *more*. Just like your favorite singers, actors, and painters do something beyond their essential task of making vocal sounds, saying lines, and putting color to canvas. Your response to your favorites is beyond the mere recognition of technically sound singing. It is probably emotional and it is the production of that response you see as a fan of music.

So, I posit that fooling the audience is not just an essential task, it is merely a tool for you to give the audience what you wish to give them. As a general rule, I tend to not like ""theatrical closeup"" because so much of it banal and mediocre. They are often stories put around an effect and often turn out being more cute rather than emotionally satisfying. The masters of theatrical closeup are few. Ultimately, this leads to ourselves merely acting as... ourselves.

So what do you want to give your audience beyond the mere feeling of being fooled? For me, it has always been a flashback to a time when the world was magic... a time before age and cynicism sets in... that magic and amazing things are out there if you're willing to just experience them (I am a big astronomy buff and often tie ideas and concepts indirectly). But for you, perhaps you want to provide humor (David Williamson), tragedy (Eugene Burger), horror (Christian Chelman), history (Ricky Jay) or be a storyteller (Hiawatha)? We often say our goal is to entertain the audience. There are countless ways to entertain an audience. When you say entertain, what do you mean? These are answers that can only be answered by yourself, for yourself. My goal is not to provide answers, just ask the question.

A monologue performer is merely a personality on the stage. Their personality and stories provide the means for provoking an emotional response. This is how we need to view our effects.

Do not perform effect after effect after effect for your audience only to provide the message ""I fooled you. And I fooled you again. And again. And I fooled you one more time."" We can be better than that.

Following are examples of some one person shows. Their essential task is to tell a story, but they take their stories and link them to a wider theme. I specifically avoided magician examples. Maybe they provide inspiration. Maybe they waste your time. Mileage will vary.

1370160338.0	1fie2y	My rebuttal	eriyg	16	10	6	"This is my response to a comment on my [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1CIkjhqts). It is too long to be posted as a comment, and to important to be sent as a private message.

Some clerical definitions: When I say ""the product"" I am referring to [Invisible by Damien Savina](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472). When I say video I am referring to my [review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1CIkjhqts) of Invisible.

**tl;dr** The use of ITR has been revealed by Ellusionist [here](http://www.ellusionist.com/thread-real-for-invisible-by-damien-savina.html) and by PenguinMagic in the product reviews [here](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472). Therefore, revealing the use of ITR in the effect has already been done by some of the sellers of the effect. This revelation will be seen by magicians and few, if any, laypeople. It can be concluded that my so-called exposure has done nothing (in the sense of exposure) that hasn't been done.



About 3 months ago I posted [this review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc1CIkjhqts) of Invisible by Damien Savina (and a written review [here](http://www.themagiccafe.com/forums/viewtopic.php?topic=503910&amp;forum=109&amp;0)) It was posted with the intent to inform potential buyers what they are getting and not with the intent of revealing the details of the effect. Please note that (almost) all potential buyers are practitioners of magic. I reveal the use (and only the use, not the actual hookup) of the ITR in the effect and show the ITR that a buyer would receive. This video has caused some people to declare me a revealer of secrets and at approximately 2PM CST on June 1, 2013, Rob Anderson declared my video to be exposure by posting ""This isn't a review. It's exposure. Why are you giving the secret away?﻿"".

This is my rebuttal.

By posting this video I show that an ITR is used in creating the effects shown in the trailer. I also describe, in detail, exactly what happens in each effect (but not *how* to do these effects). This video will have a different effect on each person that watches it, but the main difference in the effects are between laypeople, magicians who know about IT/ITR/etc.., and magicians who don't know about IT/ITR/etc...

Any layperson that watches this review will learn that IT and ITR is a thing that magicians use to create magic. This would add to the arsenal of any heckler wanting to spoil a show and would make this kind of magic less impressive to ""good"" spectators. This is assuming that a layperson would watch this review. I highly doubt a layperson will see the add for Invisible, want to know how it's done, and search for a revelation video. If you google search ""invisible damien savina"" you will find my video 2nd from the top of the page(as of June 2, 2013). If you google search ""invisible damien savina revealed"" you will find my video at the top of the page. So it is extremely accessible to anyone who knows the product I learned the effect from, but no layperson would know the product. If the layperson instead google searches ""ring levitation revealed"", my video is nowhere to be found. So as far as accessibility is concerned, only people who know where I learned the effect would be able to find my video, and those people would be magicians, not laypeople. From this we can conclude that if a layperson saw me preform this effect and wanted to find a revelation video, they would not only be hard-pressed to find my video, but in the unlikely event they found my video, they would only see the use of IT/ITR and not the actual details of their use.

So what about magicians? If a magician knows that IT is used in various effects, it is quite simple to extrapolate that any effect that involves something floating will generally involve the use of IT as it is the simplest way to apply and unseen force to an object, while making the effect of that force plainly seen; e.g. levitating a ring. The spectator does not see the thread applying the force to the ring, but sees the effect of that force (the ring floating). In fact, the general method to all of the effects on the dvd are quite trivial if the magician knows IT is being used (excluding the ring levitation); furthermore, the effects can easily be adapted to not use an ITR. Essentially, if a magician who knows IT purchased Invisible, they would be purchasing the details of the hookup, much like they would if they purchased [this](http://www.emagicsupply.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=102). The most important group of people (in my opinion) are the magicians who are not familiar, or even aware of IT and it's use.

Magicians who are not familiar with IT who purchase this product will purchase it for a reason that falls between these two extremes: 1) to learn the effect and preform it, and 2) to know how the effect is done (with no intent to preform). Ideally, buyers will purchase for more of the first reason, but this spectrum reveals a perverse truth about magic:

**The less savvy magician may purchase instruction of an effect with the little or no intent to preform, but rather to fulfill their layperson-like desire to know the secret of the effect**

This is a problem with magic that I have discovered while writing this essay and requires further study that will not be done here. This truth raises two questions: 

*1) Revelation of magic is wrong. Is revelation of general well-known methods (such as the existence/use of IT, ITR, etc...) to magicians who do not know about them wrong?*

*2) Is selling the knowledge of the existence general well-known methods wrong?*

For example, [The Fearson Hookup](http://www.emagicsupply.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=102) uses IT, but the knowledge of the existence of IT is not what is being sold, it is the innovative hookup. This is less so for Invisible, as no mention of IT or ITR is in the trailer. So in some sense, knowledge of the existence of IT/ITR is being sold, but it is paramount to note, **AND THIS IS MY MAJOR POINT** that it *is* mentioned [here](http://www.ellusionist.com/thread-real-for-invisible-by-damien-savina.html). So any answer to the ethical questions that have been raised by the perverse truth I discovered are irrelevant in this situation because the use of ITR in the effect Invisible by Damien Savina **has been revealed by Ellusionist and has been revealed in the product reviews on PenguinMagic [here](http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/3472).** A google search of ITR (when it is not abbreviated) yields [this result](http://www.thisismagic.com/html/invisible_thread_reel.html) at the top of the page. Therefore, revealing the use of ITR in the effect has already been done by some of the sellers of the effect. This revelation will be seen by magicians and few, if any, laypeople. It can be concluded that my video has done nothing (in the sense of exposure) that hasn't already been done. It is arguable that my video propagates exposure, but to argue that requires answers to the two questions I have posed, and a precise and universal definition of exposure.

Eagerly awaiting your reply,

It was a live show, similar to Enigma or Svengali, but it was outside, and the audience was sat on a set of bleachers. The one distinctive characteristic of the show was at the end, and he had a cab driver come down from the audience, and he predicted the route he would take in London if he were to pick someone up.

Am I crazy and did I just dream this up? If I did, I would like to know Derren's e-mail so that I might be able to pitch this idea to him. Any help from you folk would be greatly appreciated, and I know if anyone can find something, it would be you ~~googlers~~ ~~tumblers~~ redditors.

My question is, does anyone know any of these card tricks? Doesn't have to be anything hugely extravagant, just as long as it follows the general format of letting the audience down and then revealing the trick isn't over yet.

So far I've got a couple such as ""Back to Back"", and the trick where they cut the deck into three packets with their card being on the bottom of the third pile, but you dismiss this and use a few sleights including a pinky slide to reveal their card was actually three cards up from the bottom of the deck (can't remember the name of this one).

1360082049.0	17xt7w	Busking Diary Vol. 1	strat1227	8	1	11	"I've been busking for about 6 months now, and I'm really enjoying it and I want to spread info about it and try to encourage more people to get out and try it, so I'm going to put up weekly ""Diaries"" of my experiences, usually with an accompanying video that I break down to talk about how I handle things or what I learned.

Next weekend I'll bring my camera out and show you guys a full show from beginning to end, but this last weekend I forgot it so I just have a short cameraphone video of me doing cups and balls. But there's 3 or 4 things that happen in it to make it worth talking about imo

First off, the girl at the very beginning was heckling HARD (probably the worst heckler I've had so far). She walked up in the middle of a routine, thought she knew how something was done (she was wrong of course but that's not important lol), and was trying to tell everyone how it was done and that it wasn't impressive. So I said ""ok guys we're going to change the show up a little bit! I'm going to do a trick, and then she'll explain it!"" And then I did a muscle pass levitation that completely fried her brains lol. So by the end she was converted and wound up being a fan. So that's one good way to deal with hecklers if the situation is right.

Then cups and balls start, and in the middle of the first phase someone was whispering in his friend's ear what he thought was happening, so I had to deal with that too. I just said ""I'll teach you guys how it's done at the end, so if you think you know just keep it in your head and we'll see in the end if you were right!"" It's kind of pseudo-true because the ""explanation"" is mostly BS and an excuse for the final loads lol, but that line always works on people.

The end of the video is kind of ruined by some jerk who recognized my friend and wanted him to perform, so he was like interrupting D: But overall I think the video is interesting and worth checking out if you want to see what my busking is like.

Also, in terms of ""control"" and ""getting lost in the mix"", when I'm busking I kind of like to just become ""one of the crowd"" and not try to have too much control. I used to try to really make sure all the attention was on me a lot, and people were just standing there watching, and it worked fine but I got way less tips. When I let people kinda just do whatever they want then they have more fun, and I make a lot more money lol. You can see examples of that several times in the video (1. The chick in the beginning is touching all over me, 2. The guys wanting to check under the cups 3. The other girl grabbing one of the balls 4. The guy picking up my limes and throwing them at the end.) 

Those are all things that would typically be discouraged and would be chalked up to ""bad audience management"", but I think it just lends itself to a more fun atmosphere, which is better for my bottom line lol.

Being a magician and a fairly knowledgeable one at that is really detrimental to this.  So when I watch magic, I try as hard as I can **not** to know the method.  

I was recently talking to my local magic dealer and he performed a trick for me (a cool variation of the 21 card trick) and after the trick he said he flashed pretty badly.  I didn't notice it.  If I had, I don't think I would have enjoyed the trick as much.  

This also serves another purpose.  By avoiding the 'pick it apart' mentality, I can make special notice of the things that scream out to me.  The biggest thing I notice is awkward hand movements.  Weird ways of doing double lifts, unnecessary hand washing, etc.  These are the things that laymen notice and only by noticing them in others can you start to notice them in your own performances.

Quite the surprise."	jul3z	9	0	14	"Recently I started taking an interest to learning card magic, and my wife decided to surprise me with a copy of ""The Royal Road to Card Magic"" for father's day. We went to visit a brick and mortar magic shop nearby and they had a copy of the book which I had been itching to buy since I've seen it as a suggested text in this subreddit. I had the book on the counter with money in hand, ready to buy it when she told me not to since it would be arriving from Amazon in the next couple of days. This was on Saturday, so no delivery Sunday.


The copy arrived from Amazon today, and much to my surprise it looks like it is a pirate copy or an incredibly bad print of the book. No Copyright page, no page numbers, printed on 8.5x11 paper with an incredibly low-res image on the front as the cover and the index appears to be hyperlinks. Naturally I asked for a refund, as I don't want to be party to this if it isn't legit. 

Has anyone seen or heard of anything like this regarding RRCM before, and if so, did they find out if it was legit? Also, who can I report something like this to? If I wanted to pirate a book, there is far cheaper ways of doing it than paying 15 bucks.

- Magicians Equivoque 
Is my all time favorite trick. 
With the majority of my tricks being mentalist based.. equivoque is the most natural force I know (and best working for me because of that). 

- Basic 14/15 split Book test. 
My favorite book test is also the easiest one I know how to perform. 
It requires that you pre-stack a deck in a 14/15 split. 
(a fundamental stack of mentalist right up there with the 8 kings stack)
It also requires that you get a peak at the first sentences on page 140 and 150 of a book you'll later force on a spectator via you're favorite method (mine again being equivoque). 

- Wounded by Robert Smith. 
(You learn 3 things: 1) Stop your pulse, 2) Develop stigmata on your palms, 3) Start streaming tears of blood from your eyes)
By no means is that trick for everyone, but I used to do a 'dark' act and man did that one hit haaaaard. 
It doesn't get a whole lot better than talking about walking the line between this side and 'the other' and than right in front of everyone 
tears of blood start streaming down your face :P
(I also once used this trick to get out of a major test in Uni)

- Super man coin bend is up there with my favorite fun tricks. I normally don't like to carry gimmicks around, but having the ability to bend coins in front of people is pretty useful when you're convincing them that as a mentalist the mind is more powerful than we give it credit for. 
Vid here: 
http://www.ellusionist.com/superman-coin-bend.html

- Electric Touch by Yigal Mesika
being able produce a static shock on demand has seriously heightened the level of ""omg"" during a performance. 
Think of this, I ask someone to concentrate on their thought. I ask them to try as hard as they can to charge the thought, make it electric. I stick out my finger and ask them to 'pass the thought on to me'. They touch my finger and Boom, static shock. 
Yes it's just a normal static shock, but in that situation... man... they really feel like they've some how just transferred their thought over to me. It really does heighten my mentalist based tricks.

- Extreme Burn 2.0 By Richard Sanders
The ability to change $1's to $20's in such a friggin clean way is amazing. This trick is most definitely worth the $35 (honestly I think it's worth quite a bit more and wish he hadn't released it past the initial limited amount). 

Anyways, nothing I've ever done has been cleaner than going out to the bar with some friends (or meeting some people at a club or what not), buying some drinks and when it comes time to pay.. pulling out a wad of 5 $1's for a $32 tab.. than looking around slightly embarrassed as you count out you're 5 $1 bills in front of everyone.
People start saying, ""oh hold on I'll help you out"". You stop them and go, ""wait wait I promised to get this"".  Than slap the bills (or rotate them.. and they instantly become $20's .. take 2 of 5 $20's hand them to the waiter or what have you and tell them to keep the change. 
Everyone just sits there silent. 
(of course for kickers I then change the $20's back into $1's and count out the 3 $1's I have left and proclaim someone else is going to have to buy the next round because I'm broke! 
(You can watch a video of it here) 
http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/2120

- WTF ACAAN
It's to date my favorite any card at any number. 
The ability to not touch the deck the whole time, have the spectator choose a number, and a card, have them open the box, take out the deck and count down the cards (you could be across the room the whole time)... it's a great trick 
Video here: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8riMkHRJntc


Edit: forgot these classics ! 

- Richard Osterlind's Breakthrough Card System. 
First off I should say watching Richard is what got me into mentalism. I had been doing regular 'magic' tricks for a good while before being exposed to the type of magic Richard preforms. It left me saying, ""how.. but.. he.. uh.. magic??""
... For the life of me I can't memorize a deck of cards. God knows I've tried. Because a good amount of tricks are based on a memorized deck, I was kind of left out of the loop.... that is until I found out about Richards BCS. It allowed me to know the position of any card in the deck on the fly with out having to think in complex mathematical formals like most card systems. 
I consider it to be one of my most useful utilities to date.

- TnR (Torn and Restore) by Mathieu Bich
I'd never seen a TnR like this with such a ... wow.. twist to it. 
(While I don't preform it anymore since it doesn't fit into my current act.. it was always a kicker / still is when I do it for my friends).
Have someone pick a card out of the deck (lets say King of clubs). 
Shuffle the deck and flip over top card proclaiming to have found their card (in this case the top card welll say is a 6 diamonds).. 
The spectator says, ""no .. thats not my card :(
You pretend to get frustrated and than you rip the 6D into 4 parts 
(yes you actually really rip it up). 
say.. wait actually let me show you a neat trick.. 
Take one of the pieces hand the spectator the other 3 and than slowly start to put the 4D back together right in front of them! 
As if this miracle wasn't enough....
You turn the card around (which has been in front of the spectator the whole time you've been putting it together) and boom.. its the King of Clubs.. with all the marks of being torn into 4 and pieced back together. 
It seriously leaves the spectator questioning themselves haha.

Too often I skip past tricks in that series because they're not ""my style"". My challenge to myself today is to take a random trick from that series, no matter the style, spend an hour or so learning it, and then have a video of me performing it up on /r/magic by 2pm.

However, I will *only* perform it if:

* After an hour's practice I can do it well enough that I won't expose the method through sloppy handling
* I have or can obtain the materials needed to perform it.
* It's a full trick and not just a simple technique like a count or a palm or something (unless it's really that great).

So, all I need is for someone to go to [Random.org](http://www.random.org/), generate a number from 1 to 2880, and post it! I'll take the first number posted that meets my criteria above. (If the page lands in the middle of a trick, I'll flip back and learn that trick).

It may be sloppy, it may suck, but I'm gonna do it. For science!

1372031625.0	1gxptu	Sunday Essay: When Character takes hold	RC-Roi92	8	3	12	"I thought we’d discuss a subject that in the recent years has gotten a lot of press. That is if you should have a character or not. Robert Houdin, the father of modern day conjuring, said that a magician is an actor playing the part of a man with supernatural gifts. There is a lot of truth in that, but it does create a few questions that we as performers need to answer ourselves. 

The creation of a character is an important and vital step toward becoming a better magician. The way you can analyze and choose what your character will say or do without regarding your own personal prejudice is important. It’s also important as a way for you to experiment with different styles without feeling put off because “it just isn’t me.” So when creating a new character, think about this: 

1. Who am I?
2. Where am I?
3. When is it?
4. Where have I just come from?
5. What do I want?
6. Why do I want it?
7. Why do I want it now?
8. What will happen if I don't get it now?
9. How will I get what I want by doing what?
10. What must I overcome?

Those are taken from a [article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/may/09/character-building-great-actor) that I read a week or two ago explaining what makes a character great. The questions are for those with a script, but maybe it can help you create one.

I’d like to compare us to engines at this point (I do a lot of comparing in this one). Now stay with me here, think of humans as driven only by our desires and our will to fulfill those desires. The desires help us choose our path in life, and therefore affect us as a person. The fuel for your engine is the realization of your desires. What fuels your engine? That’s what defines you. This is a seriously reduced version of a person, but can be helpful in character development.

But while one side of magicians find that having a character is paramount to the effect. You’ll have the other guys saying the complete opposite. The danger, they say, is that you’ll come of as phony or fake, that people will see right through the bullshit you’ve worked so hard to buy. I tend to disagree, what makes you believable as anyone, is your ability to actually be anyone. If you’re a bad actor then of course people will see right through your act and think that you’re kind of camp. But doing it correctly will lead to a clarity of effect that is hard to create otherwise. Think about Apollo Robbins, now of course he has drawn a lot of his character out of himself, but he’s still a very “smooth” guy. His character is in every minute detail of his actions and effects. You could even say that without his character the show would lose its soul and theme. Same goes for Derren Brown, he has created such realism in his character that people actually believe that he has supernatural mind reading powers and that his skills surpass those of anyone else, he’s a phenomenal actor. 

Choosing material also becomes easier. You now don’t have to think, does this work for me? But rather; is this something my character would do? The difference is drastic as suddenly your “engine” becomes a much simpler machine, only made to do magic and amaze. So when you think about if your character who is a smooth, suave James Bond’esque kind of pickpocket, and if he’s a nice fit for the jumping sponge bunnies, you’ll know the answer as soon as you’ve asked the question. 

If we look at the characters we see in movies, characters we love to compare ourselves to and feel that we have a connection with, you’ll see that more often than not they’re actually quite simple(most of them). We don’t really see their multitude of colors but rather we see the brightest most beautiful color that they have. And that’s what you want to show and polish, regardless if you create a character or play yourself.

It really consists of my ACR, two card monte, and a version of [S.W.A.K.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1DfsUxuqg), and triumph(if i'm near a table). I don't know what I should learn now. I want to start performing more on the street but I don't feel confident enough. I've been doing magic for around 2 years so I can handle more advanced tricks if they are supplied, but I am not opposed to simple tricks. Sometimes they are the best.

I've already got plans for the actual magic trick I'll be doing for my talent. However, the trick only takes about 1:30 minutes to perform and we are given 3:30 for our act. That leaves me with 2 minutes to play with, and I decided what I want to do is use that time to tell a cheap joke or two and possibly a cheap yet easy to perform parlor tricks. The flashier and cheesier and less impressive and stupider the better. The idea being that I'll open with the stupid jokes and tricks and lull the audience into a sense of complacency and thinking that my act is stupid, then catch them off guard and blindside them with my amazing finale before they know what hit them.

He claims that because he is a mentalist he doesn't have to conform with the rules of Magic and he doesn't care about being as ""clean"".  Does anyone have thoughts about this?

I have seen a lot of magic shows where I cant figure out how the trick is being done the entire time.  In fact most magic shows I can't figure it out.  But watching iOS magicians is kinda lame to me, it just seems like really simple sleight of hand tricks that use not only a computer to make allusions look better but also gives you a large screen to hide things behind that you are holding in your hands.

Then we could upload videos of ourselves performing the effect and offer feedback/choose the best performance. The winner's handling would then be published in magicsecrets (or perhaps under some sort of open source license. Not sure how that works).

1373162698.0	1hs4q2	Card to Mouth + Smoke	eriyg	6	2	11	"**tl;dr** I need a way to make smoke appear in my mouth and am considering Smoke by Alan Rorrison, but do not like the fact that I may (probably will) need to buy refills. Are there any better/similar products? Are there any good products that teach a recipe for creating smoke (they don't need to include a way to use that smoke, I can figure that out myself.)?

I was watching some old wizard product reviews and I came across [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-ILATfA22I&amp;list=UUp-UJCv7ACFtbpEEJx6E-Fw&amp;index=42) where they give an entertaining review of Shin Lim's S.S.S. I thought of purchasing it when it was released, but decided not to because of negative/dubious reviews. However, in this review they focus on how he doesn't teach his card to mouth effect in the dvd and talked about how they wished he did, because it was such a good effect. After pondering what they said I realized that it would be an incredible closer to many card routines. My goal became clear, learn/create this routine (not the exact same handling, but the same effect).

Getting the card into my mouth is simple, as I have a lot of experience with cards. The tricky part is getting the smoke. In the review, they mentioned Smoke by Alan Rorrison. A google search of this reveals multiple sellers and images showing the gimmick. The images look like they were shot professionally, so weather or not the public nature of the images are ethical is up for debate (preferably not here). The gimmick looks unrestrictive and the magic cafe has nothing bad to say about it, so this is a good (and currently my only) candidate for creating smoke. There are two minor issues I see.

1) I looked at multiple dealers and there is a HUGE price difference between them. Penguinmagic and Theory11 are selling for $50 but [here](http://www.approachchina.com/smoke-by-alan-rorrison-p-593.html) it is being sold for **$11.50!** It says you get the dvd and gimmicked sharpie but nothing about smoke cartridges or the usb thingy (I have no idea what it is or is used for), but in one of the images it shows all of these things. 

Here &lt;http://www.52magic.net/1558_Smoke-by-Alan-Rorrison-(DVD-+-GIMMICK).html&gt; they sell for $20 and say it includes the dvd+gimmick; I can't imagine it wouldn't come with cartridges+usb thingy, but I wouldn't be surprised either way.

[Here](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-Smoke-by-Alan-Rorrison-DVD-GIMMICK-magic-tricks-magic-sets-magic-props-magic/601499096.html?tracelog=back_to_detail_a) is the same as the last one, but they also show a picture of everything.

So I don't really know who to trust should I decide to purchase this product.

The second issue I see, is the need for refills (this is where S.S.S. comes in again). I'm not sure how long each cartridge lasts, but in any case there will come a time when it will be impossible to buy refill cartridges (unless there is a universal standard which this gimmick follows, but that seems doubtful). So I need a more reliable source for the smoke cartridges. I heard that S.S.S. teaches a recipe for making smoke, is this true? Are there better recipes on better dvds/books that I can purchase? If I have a recipe for creating smoke ""cartridges"" (the fact that S.S.S. doesn't have any refills makes me believe it is taught on there, and therefore perhaps it is taught in other dvds/books) I think designing an apparatus to activate the cartridges and get the smoke into my mouth would not be entirely impossible; or is there a better gimmick sold that does such a thing? Or are homemade cartridges usable with Smoke's gimmick?

Answers to any of these questions would be appreciated.

I've been thinking about TRYING to get into big illusions like sawing the woman in half, Assistance's-Revenge, Impossible Levitations with the music and all. 

Where do I begin with THOSE sorts of illusions?

1369508489.0	1f1ir3	My thoughts on Copper Silver Brass (C.S.B.) coin routines.	Jokers247	6	0	4	"I love transposition magic. Its probably my favorite type of effect to perform. For this reason the copper, silver, brass coins always intrigued me. I was fortunate enough to have  some mad money and i bought some items fro Jamie Schoolcraft and the CSB set was one of them. Now i just had to find a routine that suited me.  

I was really looking for a routine that didnt have too much pocket work, that didnt tip the use of extra coins, and that had a little bit of audience participation. The classic Doc Eason routine was out, this is a great routine but it didnt fit my requirements.  

So i looked and i looked. I looked at routines by Dan Watkins: ""CSB ASSUALT"" from his Coin Man Walking dvd. good walk around routine, uses a spectator, but its got some angle issues, didnt clean up in a way that i liked. This routine will take some work and also uses a move that will scare off some coin workers.  

Cody Fisher: ""Real World CSB"" from his Unforgettable Coin Magic dvd. Another solid routine, deffinitely will take some work, uses a spectator, needs a few extras. A good routine for sure but its not the one i use. 

Jeremy Pei: ""CSB Transformation"" from his Ultimate CSB Magic dvd. This is a must own dvd if you have a CSB set. Most of the routines need an extra something that most coin workers will have. This routine is a Classic CSB routine that has a really great ending. This is my second go to CSB routine. It doesnt involve a spectators hands unfortunately.   

Then i remembered that one of my favorite magicians, John Bannon, had a CSB routine in his Smoke and Mirrors book. Its the Aztec Orient Express and it is great. Its three main phases with an optional fourth phase at the end (which shouldnt be optional, the fourth phase is killer). He has you use a house hold item to deal with noise issues, which is brilliant. He teaches you a new switch which is very convincing. The routine has spectator involvement. This routine is very visual. It ends clean in the spectators hand, huge plus. I love this routine. You can never go wrong with John Bannon's work. This routine is a worker!  

If you have a csb set dont let it collect dust. Use it. Search for Smoke and Mirrors book (also its one of the best books i own) and the Jeremy Pei dvd. If youre looking to get a csb set i hope some of this helped (if youre looking to purchase a set the Johnson set is a worker and not terribly expensive). All the routines mentioned, including Doc Eason's, are great in there own way and are worth studying. Bannon's routine is the one that just works perfectly for me. "	t5_2qh74	True
