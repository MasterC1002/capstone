1371192580.0	1gbp63	YSK that on Tuesday a judge confirmed what intern advocates have been alleging for years: a lot of upaid intership programs are illegal.	God_Wills_It_	5613	2980	480	"Unpaid internships* are increasingly a fact of life for college students. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 55 percent of the class of 2012 had an internship or co-op during their time in college. Almost half of those — 47 percent — were unpaid. A third of internships at for-profit companies were unpaid.

Depending on how you look at it, this is either massive exploitation of young people by powerful corporations which worsens inequality, or a valuable opportunity for on-the-job training at lower cost than a degree or certificate at a college or university.

But whatever your moral leanings, a judge on Tuesday confirmed what intern advocates have been alleging for years: a lot of these programs are illegal.

Judge William Pauley, who sits on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled that Fox Searchlight’s use of interns in the production of the movies “Black Swan” and “500 Days of Summer” violated minimum wage and overtime laws, and that those interns can file a class action against the studio. He concluded:

They worked as paid employees work, providing an immediate advantage to their employer and performing low-level tasks not requiring specialized training. The benefits they may have received — such as knowledge of how a production or accounting office functions or references for future jobs — are the results of simply having worked as any other employee works, not of internships designed to be uniquely educational to the interns and of little utility to the employer. They received nothing approximating the education they would receive in an academic setting or vocational school.

The tests being hinted at there — of whether an internship provides valuable training and whether it benefits the firm or the intern more — reflect the reasoning of a 2010 fact sheet put out by the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Divison, which enforces these laws. That fact sheet sets up six criteria to determine if an internship is legal or not:

1.The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment;

2.The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern;

3.The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff;

4.The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;

5.The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and

6.The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the internship.

Pauley cites that fact sheet, reproduces all six points, and then proceeds to determine if the internships in this case satisfied all six requirements. Perhaps the most important result of the ruling is that it treats that fact sheet, effectively, as a binding interpretation of federal law around internships.

Some employment attorneys think that move is a mistake. “You’ve got to consider a lot of different factors including these six factors,” Camille Olson, a partner at Seyfarth and Shaw who frequently defends companies in wage and hour cases.

A better analysis, she argues, can be found in Xuedan Wang v. The Hearst Corporation, a case in which Wang, a former unpaid intern at Harper’s Bazaar, tried to put together a class action on behalf of the Heart Corporation’s unpaid interns. The judge in that case, Harold Baer (also of the Southern District of New York), didn’t discount the six-factors in the fact sheet — “After all,” he writes, “they emanate from the agency that administers the laws under which Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit.” – but also argued that one must look at the “totality of circumstances.”

Baer ruled that Wang couldn’t file a class action, as she couldn’t show that all of Hearst’s interns faced similar enough conditions for them to file a suit together. But more importantly for these cases going forward, he denied summary judgment for the plaintiffs. That is, unlike Pauley, he declined to rule, without a trial, that Wang and her prospective co-plaintiffs were employees covered by minimum wage and overtime laws.

The trial has been adjourned indefinitely, though Juno Turner, one of Wang’s attorneys at the firm Outten &amp; Golden, which also represents the interns in the Fox case, confirms that they’re planning on going forward with a jury trial. All of which reinforces Olson’s point that Pauley is just just one judge, in just one district, and it’s hard to predict what appeals court judges will rule on any of these cases.

As you can imagine, intern advocates disagree vehemently with Olson’s suggestion that the reasoning in the Pauley ruling was weak. ” I think the reasoning will stand up strongly and clearly,” Ross Perlin, author of “Intern Nation” and a critic of unpaid internships, says. That includes, he continues, the reasoning that for-profit companies’ interns are employees entitled to back pay, and that they constitute a class that can file a class action suit.

They also differ on which kinds of firms are breaking these laws. Perlin argues that even non-profit firms — which are allowed to have unpaid “volunteers” — are likely in violation of the law if they have actual unpaid interns. “Just because you’re working for somebody who’s been classified as a 501(c)3 doesn’t mean you don’t have to treat them like workers,” he says, though he concedes, “Interns would have the burden of proving they’re not volunteers. Somebody is going to have to step up and make the case.” A logical place to start, he says, would be D.C. “Congress has exempted its own interns from fair labor standards act,” he says. “That’s something waiting to be addressed.”

Olson thinks that’s far-fetched. “We’ve had volunteers at hospitals and not-for-profits that are performing responsibilities, and never had a claim to paid work,” she says. “It would be a first, but I don’t think there’s a strong argument to be made there.”

But the two agree that there are many for-profit companies currently in violation of the law, even if Fox Searchlight and Hearst aren’t specifically among them. “In the last 3-4 years for-profit companies are really reviewing their internship programs, and eliminating unpaid internships more and more, because they don’t want to run the risk that there’s not enough benefit for the worker,” she says. “Of the ones that do offer internships, many have revised them so they are paying minimum wage.”

That’s largely an effect of media scrutiny, she argues. “The media coverage has made a difference in companies having heightened awareness, that they want their programs to be compliant,” she says. “And that’s a really good thing.” That could be the most important way that cases like this change things. Neither Olson nor Perlin have noticed the Department of Labor stepping up enforcement lately, and lawsuits are a rather expensive and time-consuming way to protect your rights. Olson notes that some settlements in these cases have been as paltry as $1,100.

She advises interns who think their companies are running afoul of the law to talk to their human resources department, perhaps through an anonymous tip, or to contact their state or federal wage and hour department to get answers on what’s required, and whether the company is violating those rules. Potentially the matter could be resolved without the cost of a lawyer.

Of course, you’d expect a defendant’s lawyer to say that, but she has a point. The worst thing that happens if you file an internal complaint is that you lose the unpaid internship, and the $0 in future compensation that you could have gotten from it. And if the reputational cost of being fired from the internship is too great to bear, then legal recourse is still available. Unpaid interns have nothing to lose but their chains.

\* Full disclosure: I’ve had three unpaid summer internships in my life, two at nonprofits and one at a for-profit that hasn’t made a profit in years. The Washington Post pays its interns, who are great.

Update: The first version of this article said 52 percent of the class of 2012 had internships or co-op experiments in college. The actual number is 55 percent. We regret the error.

First, you should know that any federal or state law empowering the citizen is a *privilege* that can be taken away, not a right. The only rights we have are part of the constitution one way or another: through the text, what it implies, or a SCOTUS case. 

So this post is going to be split into rights and privileges, and it will *only* concern the Constitution of the United States and rights granted through SCOTUS cases. Before the Constitution's Bill of Rights was implemented in 1791, many states had their own bills of rights and all of them still do, so you need to read your state constitutions to find out if there's anything that goes past the federal constitution. Remember that we are 50 semi-sovereign states united, not a unitary government. 

###**Rights**

1) Some states require that you identify yourself, but you need to ask whether or not you are being detained. If not, you can walk away. As always, don't be a dick. At finish your conversation and move on. Do *not* become hostile just because someone stopped you. 

2) You have the right to refuse a search of yourself, your car, or your home. Your home has the most stringent standard of evidence, then your car, then you. 

3) If you are arrested, you have the right to a lawyer. 

4) You invoke the right to silence by explicitly stating what you're doing. 

5) If you're a photographer like me, don't delete that picture! No one can make you do it. It's unconstitutional in more ways than one. 

###**Rights Subsequently Granted by SCOTUS**

**1959**

- *Bartkus v. Illinois* = Crimes that are tried in state court *and* in federal court do not violate Dual Jeopardy Clause due to the doctrine of dual sovereignty.

**1963**

- *Gideon v. Wainright* = All indigent persons must be given an attorney at the state's expense. 

**1966** 

- *Miranda v. Arizona* = Law enforcement required to inform suspect of right to remain silent and right to counsel.

**1984**

In my opinion, this case has a very... we'll say ""interesting"" year...

- *Nix v. Williams* = Inevitable discovery exception to exclusionary rule. Police may introduce unconstitutionally discovered evidence at trial if they can prove that they would have found the evidence anyway through constitutional means. 

**1987**

- *Arizona v. Hicks* = Established plain view doctrine. Irrelevant evidence in plain view may be legally gathered. 

**1990**

- *Horton v. California* = Expands the in plain view doctrine by removing the requirement that evidence was *inadvertently* discovered. 

**1998**

- *Knowles v. Iowa* Automobiles can not be searched on routine traffic stops because it counts as unreasonable search and seizure. 

**1999**

- *Wyoming v. Houghton* Police may search the belongings of all passengers in the car when lawfully seeking evidence against the driver. 

You are going to get in trouble if someone is doing something illegal in your car while you are driving. 

**2010**

- *Berghuis v. Thompkins* = Suspect's silence does not itself invoke right to silence. Suspect must explicitly state invocation of the right, and will forfeit right by breaking subsequent silence provided that the suspect was given and understood the Miranda warning. 

###**Privileges**

- You *generally* have the right to photograph anything in plain view. People do not have a right to privacy when they're in public and that includes law enforcement. Exceptions are shooting into homes and on private property, where the people have no reasonable expectation but the property owner can deprive you of the right to photograph.

- You *generally* have the right to not identify yourself to a police officer who does not suspect you of anything. 24 states have stop-and-identify laws. 

- You *generally* have the right to record what happens. 38 states are one-party-consent states. "	t5_2r94o	True

It’s another game where a lot of people attribute losses to bad luck. Sure, you have no control over what tiles you have, but a seasoned player will beat a novice practically every time. Clearly, the tiles aren’t everything.

Before I discuss strategy though, a word on words. Language is not fixed. Should “blogging” be valid in Scrabble? How about “irregardless?” That word you and your sister made up as kids? Common words uttered in Pig Latin? Obscure 17th-century words that are still in dictionaries but effectively gutted from our vocabulary? These beg interesting historical and linguistic questions. But if you ask any competitive Scrabble player, those questions are irrelevant. There is a single list of authoritative words, called (appropriately enough) the Tournament Word List (TWL). It’s the most recent edition of the *Official Scrabble Player’s Dictionary* with three important changes: (1) offensive words are included; (2) words with roots over 8 letters are added; and (3) definitions are removed (to save space). That’s the authority. If you play a word in the TWL, it’s valid. If your word isn’t in the TWL, it’s invalid. Although some players use word meanings as a memorization aid, no serious players remember all (or even most) of them. Nor are players particularly concerned with why such-and-such word is included or left out. You’ve gotta draw the line somewhere. With that said, here are a few general tips to up your Scrabble game.


**1. Know your 2-letter words.**

This *alone* boosts your average score by about 50 points and puts you at an enormous advantage against someone who doesn’t know the 2s. Knowing these words basically makes parallel plays--playing a word parallel to another word, forming a bunch of little words along the way--possible. Don’t forget you get points for all those little words too. And they can add up. There are only 101 of the 2-letter words, and you know about half of them already. If you are looking for a quick and reliable shortcut to beating your friends, this is probably more important than the rest of my tips combined.

**2. Stop playing defensively.**

How many times have you seen an awesome opening--an easy link to a triple word score, for instance--but just didn’t have anything good to put there? So instead, you make some crappy low-scoring play to block your opponent. More often than not, you’re actually hurting your score. Blocking a good opening not only stops your opponent from playing there, it also stops *you* from playing there in case your opponent can’t. This effect is compounded further if your opponent is good. Good players can work with whatever board they have, meaning the *only* person you’re blocking is yourself. Generally speaking, if you have a better move (worth at least around 8 more points), go for it.

**3. Save up for bingos.**

I’m always surprised when a casual player doesn’t realize there’s a 50-point incentive for using all of your tiles at once (called a bingo). That’s a lot of points. I’ve played a lot of games that essentially boiled down to who got the most bingos. The most valuable tiles for getting bingos are, in order, the blank, S, and E. Think at least one move ahead! Whenever you make a move, pay equal attention to what tiles you leave behind. There’s a general rule of thumb, in fact. Don’t play an S unless the move you’re thinking of beats your next-best move by at least 8 points. And don’t use the blank unless it beats your next-best move by at least *20* points. Save them for bingos.

Here’s an example. Let’s say you have the rack AEIKRST. What words do you think you’d play? A lot of casual players would go for RAKES or SKATE, or maybe if they have a good eye for anagramming, KAISER (the longest valid play with just those letters). In most cases though, you’re actually hurting yourself! Look how awesome your letters are, aside from that pesky K. With no other information, I’d suggest just trying to get rid of the K or maybe playing one of the 2-letter words KI or KA (if you know your 2s) and keeping the rest. Let’s say you just play the K and draw a D. Do you see a common bingo in ADEIRST? (Answers at end.)

The single biggest thing that drives me nuts when playing against a casual opponent? When they use the blank for anything less than a 40- or 50-point word. It’s actually a little unusual for a competitive player to use a blank on something other than a bingo. Consider the rack AEIRST plus one blank. Do you see a common bingo there? (Answers at end.)

**4. Look for prefixes and suffixes.**

The act of actually moving tiles around, even just a few times, is helpful for practically anyone, top-tier Scrabblers included. (Although at certain level, this strategy becomes a bit more nuanced.) Move RE or UN to the beginning of your rack. Or move ING or ED to the end. Even though it doesn’t seem like a huge difference, juggling 4 or 5 tiles in your head is *worlds* easier than juggling all 7. This is how you’ll find most bingos. To see what I mean, try and find the words in these letters. Watch what happens if you isolate common prefixes and suffixes: EINSWU, CEINORS, DEENSU. (Answers at end.)

**5. Treat your Q like the plague.**

Don’t let the ‘10’ on it deceive you. It’s one of the worst tiles. Probably *the* worst. It can outright cost you a game if you don’t draw it until the end. Having an additional U upgrades it from plague to minor cold, but it’s still something you should try and get rid of. The problem is when you have the Q, you’re basically only playing with 6 tiles. That’s a pretty big disadvantage against an opponent who can use all 7. Know the words QI and QAT. There’s a whole host of similarly helpful words: QAID, QADI, QANAT, SUQ, QUA, and so on. It’s a list worth memorizing, albeit not as game-changing as the 2-letter words.

One final note: an English degree doesn’t really help you at all. There are roughly 180,000 words in the TWL. Of those, you probably know around 30,000 of them. Think about that: Over 80 percent of the acceptable words in Scrabble mean nothing to you. Moreover, consider what words are most useful in Scrabble. Words with lots of vowels (AALII, ILIA, URAEI). Seven- and eight-letter bingos with lots of common letters (ANESTRI, SEROTINE, AUDIENT). Words that help you dump an excess number of a particular tile (NINON, LALL, ABAYA). Words that hook on to common words (SPIRATE, QUINTETT, ENOW). An opponent with an English degree might stump you once in a while with a nice SAT word you’ve never heard before, but no one picks up good Scrabble words just by reading a lot. They’re words you memorize through concerted study.

1. There are actually 8 valid bingos with ADEIRST. Here they are in approximate order of commonness: TIRADES, ASTRIDE, ARIDEST (most arid), TARDIES (‘tardy’ can be a noun), STAIDER (more staid), DISRATE (to lower a rating), DIASTER (a stage in mitosis).
2. There are 70(!) valid bingos with ?AEIRST. (The blank is usually represented with a question mark.) I can’t speak to how many of them you know, but some of them are quite common: WAITERS, RACIEST, SALTIER, TRIAGES, RETAILS, ATTIRES, and NASTIER, to name a few.

**Here are 9 clues in a poem:**

    As I have gone alone in there

    And with my treasures bold,

    I can keep my secret where,

    And hint of riches new and old.

    Begin it where warm waters halt

    And take it in the canyon down,

    Not far, but too far to walk.

    Put in below the home of Brown.

    From there it’s no place for the meek,

    The end is drawing ever nigh;

    There’ll be no paddle up your creek,

    Just heavy loads and water high.

    If you’ve been wise and found the blaze,

    Look quickly down, your quest to cease

    But tarry scant with marvel gaze,

    Just take the chest and go in peace.

    So why is it that I must go

    And leave my trove for all to seek?

    The answers I already know

    I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak

    So hear me all and listen good,

    Your effort will be worth the cold.

    If you are brave and in the wood

    I give you title to the gold.




**4 more announced clues:**

* The treasure is hidden higher than 5,000 feet above sea level.

* No need to dig up the old outhouses, the treasure is not associated with any structure.

* The treasure is not in a graveyard.

* The treasure is not hidden in Idaho or Utah.

* You buy 85/15 ground beef.  Anything more lean is going to really diminish the flavor.

* You wash your hands and dry them.

* You pick up a handful of meat, however much meat you want, big or small doesn't matter.  

* You DO NOT smash the meat up and form it into a pretty ball and then shape it in to a pretty perfect patty.

* The more you handle the meat the more tough and not delicious your burger will be.  

** DO NOT MAN HANDLE THE MEAT!  **

* You take the handful of meat and you slap it between two hands like a meat high five so it is 1/2 inch thick.

* You do not make it pretty.  You do not handle the meat. 

* You sprinkle some salt and pepper on both sides and slap it on a hot grill, or griddle, frying pan whatever.  

** DO NOT SMOOSH DOWN THE BURGERS WHILE THEY ARE COOKING FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY! **

* You cook the burger one one side, flip it over and then cook the other side.  

* Give it a little poke with your finger

They focus on other information that isn't relevant instead.


Let us imagine a town with 1million inhabitants. 100 of those are dangerous terrorists. Fortunately, the authorities have an amazing device to scan all inhabitants and will identify a terrorist (by ringing a bell) with an accuracy of 99%.

Citizen K is scanned, and the bell goes off. What is the chance that he is a terrorist? If you said 99%, you are wrong. It is nearer 1%. By assuming the two probabilities are related (they're not), you have just committed the base-rate fallacy. Look:

In this town of 1million, this device will correctly identify 99 of the 100 terrorists, and incorrectly identify 9,999 of the remaining 999,900 citizens.  This gives us 10,998 people loaded onto a bus to Guantanamo, of which only 99 are actually terrorists, or roughly 1%.

Boring numbers aside, what's the takeaway from this? Terrorists are hard to identify not because they are especially secretive, but because they are rare.  Data is noisy, especially when collected en masse. Noise (useless data) can be incorrectly identified as signal when not properly studied.

Stay in school kids, and learn maths.

While the dice rolls obviously add an element of randomness to it, strategy also plays heavily in the game. This is the strategy that I use, and not only are most of my games pretty short (about 1 hour), they tend to be exciting and I nearly always win. Here's how to win at Monopoly.

[Here's the board for reference.](http://i.imgur.com/VMSlO.jpg)


##Which properties you should buy:

Nearly all of them. Seriously. Try to get as many properties as you can. The money they cost is worth considerably less than how much value you'll get out of them. If you offer a person $100 or Oriental Avenue in a trade, which do you think they are most likely to accept? Oriental Avenue, of course. Getting $100 is easy, acquiring a specific property is rather difficult.

However, there are some properties that I would avoid paying full price for. You're not going to win with the utilities. If they go up for auction, bid up to 125 if you have the money to spare. (You should definitely at least consider bidding $90 even if most of your money is tied up in houses and properties). Mortgage it afterwards, and you've now paid 50 dollars to make sure you don't have to pay up to 120 dollars to someone else later on. You can also use this card for trades if you'd like, although they aren't as useful as other properties for this.

You're also not going to win the game through the railroads. However, if someone else gets all four of them, they can make things very annoying for you as you'll have to pay them $200 every time you land on any railroad. Depending on how things are going, you may want to secure one of the railroads for yourself.

##Properties to invest in:

Every property on the first half of the board (in between Go and Free Parking) is very useful. They are often ignored by inexperienced players, but they are in fact the key to winning monopoly. There has not been a single time I've won where I've tried to secure a monopoly through the second half of the board. This is why:

Houses in the first half of the board go from only 50-100 dollars. That means that to get hotels on all of the light blue properties, I only have to pay 750 dollars. With a rent of around $500, I'll get a profit by only the second time someone lands on the properties. And people are statistically way more likely to land on the light blues than any of the properties on the second half.

Compare that to the red properties. Buying houses with 750 dollars for the reds will only  net you 5 measly houses. That means the most you can hope to reap in rent is 300. And with the higher price of acquiring all the red properties, you'll have less money to spend on houses to begin with. Not to mention there's a good chance the other players won't even reach that part of the board every circuit.

Reds and greens and other properties on the other side of the board are good for one reason, though. *People think they're valuable*, which means you can easily use them to get the cards you really need.

##Gameplay:

You need to acquire a monopoly as soon as possible, because whoever gets the first monopoly has a huge advantage on the other players. Trade as much as you can, even if the other players are being obstinate. An overpriced monopoly is better than no monopoly at all. You need to put hotels down right away. Mortgage all other properties for funds, and invest in some houses/hotels. Leave only about 100 dollars saved for emergencies (rent, luxury taxes, etc). The only thing that can screw you up now is if you're extremely unfortunate enough to get the property repairs tax card before anyone lands on your properties and you have nothing left to mortgage. Luckily, this rarely happens.

##Properties in order of importance:

1. Orange properties. Because of their positions on the board, you're statistically most likely to land on these properties more than any other, and hotels are pretty cheap for these at $100 a pop)

2. Light blues. Hotels are the cheapest in the game and people are very likely to land on these properties, though not as likely as the oranges.

3. Pink properties

4. Red properties. Nice for trading purposes. Do not put houses on them except as a last resort, or when you have already placed hotels on any other property. It's simply too expensive to invest in otherwise.

5. Purples. You're not going to bankrupt anyone with these, but with hotels, they can give you a lot of spare money to use on houses for other properties.

6. Yellows. Same rules as the red cards.

7. Railroads.


8. Greens and Navy blues. The only times I've ever put hotels on them was to speed up an imminent victory. It's simply too hard to win if you rely on *only* these monopolies.

9. Utilities

tl;dr: Get as many properties as you can. Invest houses/hotels in monopolies on the first half of the board (especially the oranges and light blues), use the rest for trading purposes.

Hope this helps!

[A study conducted published in the British Medical Journal](http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266)


**Abstract**

**Objective** To assess the effects of didgeridoo playing on daytime sleepiness and other outcomes related to sleep by reducing collapsibility of the upper airways in patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and snoring.

**Design** Randomised controlled trial.

**Setting** Private practice of a didgeridoo instructor and a single centre for sleep medicine.

**Participants** 25 patients aged &gt; 18 years with an apnoea-hypopnoea index between 15 and 30 and who complained about snoring.

**Interventions** Didgeridoo lessons and daily practice at home with standardised instruments for four months. Participants in the control group remained on the waiting list for lessons.

**Main outcome measure** Daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale from 0 (no daytime sleepiness) to 24), sleep quality (Pittsburgh quality of sleep index from 0 (excellent sleep quality) to 21), partner rating of sleep disturbance (visual analogue scale from 0 (not disturbed) to 10), apnoea-hypopnoea index, and health related quality of life (SF-36).

**Results** Participants in the didgeridoo group practised an average of 5.9 days a week (SD 0.86) for 25.3 minutes (SD 3.4). Compared with the control group in the didgeridoo group daytime sleepiness (difference −3.0, 95% confidence interval −5.7 to −0.3, P = 0.03) and apnoea-hypopnoea index (difference −6.2, −12.3 to −0.1, P = 0.05) improved significantly and partners reported less sleep disturbance (difference −2.8, −4.7 to −0.9, P &lt; 0.01). There was no effect on the quality of sleep (difference −0.7, −2.1 to 0.6, P = 0.27). The combined analysis of sleep related outcomes showed a moderate to large effect of didgeridoo playing (difference between summary z scores −0.78 SD units, −1.27 to −0.28, P &lt; 0.01). Changes in health related quality of life did not differ between groups.

**Conclusion** Regular didgeridoo playing is an effective treatment alternative well accepted by patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.

Quote from beekeeping on tumblr:
&gt; bees are one of the most important animals in the world and their job is a lot more than gathering honey but also because they are what scientists refer to as an “indicator species""

&gt; this means that when their populations start dwindling and then rapidly dropping, humans need to watch their shit because that means that environmental factors are too difficult for THEM to live in, so it might be difficult for US to live in, too. bees basically act as an indication that humans have a lot to worry about and when they start dying like this it deserves a lot more than a few headlines.

&gt; Without bees, we will die off.  Bayer and Monsanto continue to produce the chemicals that have been proven to kill them, and the government has their backs.  Bees pollinate 30% of our food in the US and we are passing legislation to PROTECT the scumbags responsible for killing them.

&gt; your future life without kiwis, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, peaches, sunflowers, cotton, apples, plums, pears, mustard, celery, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, beans, cherries, melons, turnips, canola oil, alfalfa, soybeans, lemons, oranges... those will be gone if bees die off. 

&gt; Bees are amazing creatures who are responsible for the comfortable lives we lead in this country and we cannot sustain and feed our population without them.

&gt; Bees are literally some of the most important creatures on this planet. I am not usually one for valuing certain living things over other living things, but bees are an exception. Without bees, the human race wouldn’t even be a thing. You like living? Then you like bees. You like other people staying alive, especially in poorly developed areas, living too? Then you still like bees.

&gt; Same to that, you should love and support Bee Keepers. Seeing Bee keepers lose their hives in such masses is absolutely devastating, because in many cases, bee keepers are the only reason hive roosting social bee species are even still in an area. They don’t just harvest honey. They take care of and maintain their bees tirelessly, and are a boon to the environment as a result, because their busy little honey makers are out there pollinating the fields of nearby flowers and farmers, pollinating small gardens and fruit trees. Bee diseases are also largely unregulated by governments and completely controlled by bee keepers. Never, ever turn your back on a bee keeper. For all you know, they are the heros of the human race, maintaining food production at this very moment.

&gt; Also of concern are farmers planting massive fields of plants with beautiful, alluring flowers that attract honeybees to them, but that do not produce suitable honey for the bees to survive on through winter. Honey that crystallizes very fast, and becomes inedible to the bees as a result. Honeybees that belong to a bee keeper can be artificially fed through winter if the honey stores are bad… but wild honeybees do not have that luxury and the colony will die.

&gt; Want to help somehow? Consider keeping bees yourself, especially if you already have an interest in food production! You can do it on your acres of land, or in your backyard. It can even be done on rooftop apartment gardens. 2 hives will give you many, many lbs of honey, even with two harvests during a good summer. You can also become involved with your local bee keeping groups! However, bee keeping isn’t for everyone. There are much smaller things you can do:

* Have beekeeper and bees in mind when choosing what regulations you support. Be loud about the things you are against!
* Plant a variety of fragrant summer blooms in your garden. Attracting bees is both good for your flowers and good for the bees! The more variety they have, the better their honey will be to support them.
* Consider leaving out water for wild bees. Peat moss lightly flooded in a dish, somewhere out of direct sunlight, is a great place for bees to drink. They will appreciate it, especially in developed areas where water sources are few.
* Don’t treat your garden with pesticides!
* Support your local bee keepers! Buy your honey local from farmer’s markets.
* Can’t find local honey? Buying online from a small time beekeeper is your next best option. Actually, buying from many different regions can give you a variety of honey flavors - different ingredients make different honeys, changing color, taste, and thickness.

I mean shoot, if this isn't the proper place to post this- by all means, tell me. But this happening is REALLY BAD and I haven't seen anything on reddit that addresses this huge problem.

No, this is not SOPA/PIPA in a different form. No, the IRS isn't going to monitor what you say on Facebook. No, IBM did not bribe a bunch of Congressmen to co-sponsor it. No, no, no.

My reading of most of the Reddit coverage of CISPA makes it clear that 95% of folks here have no idea what CISPA is, does, or is meant to cover. A lot of people think it's just a rewarmed version of SOPA. With so much hyperbole and hysteria, I think Reddit could stand for some facts.

**[HERE](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03523:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp;) is the actual bill summary from Congress.**

**[HERE](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3523rfs/pdf/BILLS-112hr3523rfs.pdf) is actual bill text that the HOR has passed.**

**Myth:** The definition of ""cyber threat information"" is so broad that it could be used to justify anything.

**Fact:** Verbatim from the bill above, page 23, Line 2: ‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘cyber threat information’ means information directly pertaining to— ‘‘(i) a vulnerability of a system or network of a government or private entity or utility; ‘‘(ii) a threat to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a system or network of a government or private entity or utility or any information stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network; ‘‘(iii) efforts to deny access to or degrade, disrupt, or destroy a system or network of a government or private entity or utility; or ‘‘(iv) efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity or utility, including to gain such unauthorized access for the purpose of exfiltrating information stored on, processed on, or transiting a system or network of a government or private entity or utility.”
**tl;dr: companies can only share anonymous threat information, on a voluntary basis, when they want to protect their systems or networks.**


**Myth:** The government can now go after all of my personal records.

**Fact:** The bill language specifically prohibits the government from gathering your personal medical, tax, library or gun records.


**Myth:** Private companies can share personal data about you for marketing purposes.

**Fact:** CISPA only allows companies to share data that is *directly related* to a cyber security threat, and they can only share threat information.


**Myth:** Under CISPA, the government will be able to read your private emails, browsing history, etc. without a warrant.

**Fact:** Cyber threat information ONLY, not private email or browsing histories, can be used or retained by the government for four specific purposes: (1) cybersecurity; (2) investigation and prosecution of cybersecurity crimes; (3) protection of individuals from the danger of death or physical injury; (4) protection of minors from physical or psychological harm.


**Myth:** IBM flew in 200 senior execs to twist arms in Congress to pass CISPA.

**Fact:** IBM has a strict corporate ban on political contributions. **[Source](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/policy5.shtml)** (feel free to look this up yourself on OpenSecrets.org)

Moreover, the 36 new co-sponsors announced that day had been in the procedural pipeline for months. IBM is far more interested in the immigration and STEM H1B visa policy changes underway.

Because these uses are so similar, the two abbreviations are easily confused. If you just stick with good old English “for example” and “that is” you won’t give anyone a chance to sneer at you. If you insist on using the abbreviation, perhaps “example given” will remind you to use “e.g.,” while “in effect” suggests “i.e.”

Credit scoring isn't black and white.

Just because you get denied by an algorithm that has set thresholds doesn't mean you don't deserve a line of credit.  It just means you could be off by literally a few points and still very worthy and responsible.

---


This isn't a myth. This isn't the regular customer service line. Its a special, relatively unknown group of reps who strictly deal with reconsidering your application. These phone numbers generally never appear on the company websites. 

I just tried it with Chase and I have a credit card that I was denied for in the mail as we speak.

Now, before you go calling one of these numbers, please do a bit of research and Google best practices when calling these numbers.

You will be speaking to someone who has total power and discretion - so **be nice to the rep on the phone**. Know what you're going to say and be prepared to answer the questions straight up that don't get asked on credit card applications.

The above is key though to why this works. When you fill out an application, it pulls your credit report and the system auto approves/denies based on various factors. This is your chance to *explain why* you have those blemishes on your report. Be honest, tell them you were 20 and given a huge line of credit and weren't as financially responsible as you are now. Or whatever the reason was. 

Either way, as long as you don't have a completely horrible score, but are within arms reach, there is a very good chance they'll reconsider, and override the denial. Good luck!

Oh, and this should only be leveraged if you just recently applied but were denied, no more than a couple weeks or so.

Fresh food: Unless you're getting food during a rush period (Often 11am-1pm and 5pm-7pm) or at a very high volume store, the fact is most of your food has probably been sitting in a UHC cabinet after it's throw-away period. While most McDonald's hold very high standards for food quality (I stress this greatly at my store) quite a few will just as well keep food longer merely to save on waste. To get quality food all the time here's some things to do.

- Ask for your meat with no salt. All burgers are sprinkled with a salt/pepper mixture after being cooked. Asking for it without salt will ensure your meat is freshly cooked. This rule applies to french fries and Filet O Fish as well. Any small meat (McDoubles) is around 40 seconds to cook, quarter meat (QP/Big n Tasty) is nearly 100 seconds, and angus meat is almost 3 minutes. 

- Fried chicken items (Nuggets, Crispy/Selects, McChicken) can be asked to made fresh, most stores won't have much fuss over it, as it gives them more time to prepare your food, it is often prepared better as well. Be aware that cooking times for nuggets and mcchicken patties are around 4 minutes, and crispy chicken items are nearly 7 minutes. 

Saving money: 

- Order a McDouble/Dbl Cheeseburger without ketchup and mustard, and have them add mac sauce and lettuce. You have a big mac and you've just saved yourself $2. You can also request it to be put on a seeded bun if you wish.

- The same can be done with their most horrible new creation, the Daily Double. It is merely a McDouble with mayo, tomato, onions and lettuce. It saves you quite a bit of money to just order as that. Around 60 cents. It amazes me how many people buy so many of these and don't realize it.

- Never buy a 10 piece nugget. Purchasing them as a 20pc or 4pc boxes is cheaper.

- You can order cooked onions on any of your items. We do this in the morning time for our steak egg and cheese bagel, and most places should do this for you. Usually take about 90 seconds on the grill to cook, but it's a nice change-up for your food sometimes, and also doesn't cost extra money.

- If you're eating inside the restaurant, order a sweet tea and simply fill it with soda. No one will ever know ;) Our employees waste more soda then who knows what.

- Removed because you're not suppose to put bad things on the internet, my mama said.

You probably did because you've walked through your local super-market or chain box store.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/kTgCblp.jpg) and [This](http://i.imgur.com/1U7wWeh.jpg) are **Cup Plungers** and are designed to unclog sink and bathtub drains. These are also the classic or original plunger designs and can be used for toliet bowls but are more suited for sinks/bathtubs because **your toilet bowl drain is curved** The bottom of these plungers is flat so it is more difficult to form a seal with the bowl

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/YQOdQGB.jpg) you can see the differences between a sink plunger (on the left) and a toilet plunger (on the right). Toilet plungers are also known as **flange plungers.** 

This more modern design is better for toliet bowl uncloggin because of it's curved shape it is significantly easier to get a seal between plunger and bowl and with the increase in size you trap a large volume of air in the seal which makes for a more powerful plunge.

You should also remember that as with anything price matters. Cheap plungers will not preform as good and for as long as ones that cost a more. 

Additionally you should have a cup plunger and flange plunger just because of the specific uses but also because you shouldn't be using a toilet plunger in the sink because of sanitation issues. 

------------------

Here are some steps for how to plunge a toilet properly. 

Place the plunger in the bowl so that it forms a seal.

Push down slowly until the cup of the plunger is completely compressed.
(WARNING: This is where people cause damage to their toilets! If you push down too hard, you will push the water through the wax seal between your toilet and the floor, and then you will have to call a plumber.)

With a quick jerk, pull the plunger back.

Repeat until the toilet drains.

So you’re wondering why on earth would you want to pull the clog back up? You’re trying to send it down the drain, right? No, actually. You’re trying to dislodge the clog. It got stuck on its way down. You need to back it up so it can try to go down a different way. That’s what the quick backwards motion does: it rocks the clog back and forth, just like a car that’s stuck in the snow, until it can move forward.

Anyway, Oxforddictionaries.com explains it well:

**Use fewer if you’re referring to people or things in the plural (e.g. houses, newspapers, dogs, students, children). *Or calories ;)*.**

For example:
 
People these days are buying fewer newspapers. 
Fewer students are opting to study science-related subjects.
Fewer than thirty children each year develop the disease.
 
**Use less when you’re referring to something that can’t be counted or doesn’t have a plural (e.g. money, air, time, music, rain).**

For example:
 
It’s a better job but they pay you less money.
People want to spend less time in traffic jams. 
Ironically, when I’m on tour, I listen to less music.
 
Less is also used with numbers when they are on their own and with expressions of measurement or time,

So, for everyone that was curious, my wisdom.

You're asking the expert here. I had trouble falling asleep for a long time, but I've accumulated a lot of advice that I personally use that almost always works unless I'm really jazzed about something.

Before bed: 

1. Get off the internet at least 20-30 minutes prior. Also, no music with a fast beat. Our heart rate will rise to mimic the bass beat of music we listen to. Relaxing music like Tangerine Dream's ""Underwater Sunlight"" or sound effects like Rainymood.com are better options.

2. If you can't get offline, at least turn down the screen brightness. Fl.ux gives me a headache.

3. If you're really hungry, drink a lot of water.

4. Take some melatonin if you really have a hard time. Read [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/17gffp/proper_use_of_melatonin_please_upvote/) for more information on dosage and long-term use. As always, consult a doctor before taking any drug regardless of how harmless it may seem, especially for extended periods.

5. Avoid eating a meal at least 3 hours before bed.

6. If you're super hungry, make a small sandwich with like one piece of bread or have some cheese and half a glass of milk. Nothing acidic or sugary.

7. No caffeine at least 5 hours before bed. Seriously. Also, don't drink a lot of water too close to bedtime if you have an overactive or small bladder. **Edit: Everyone metabolizes caffeine differently, and there is a genetic marker for fast or slow caffeine metabolizer. I'm a ""fast."" If you have trouble figuring this out, try stopping earlier and earlier until you figure out your personal timing.**

8. Brush and floss yo damn teeth.


Bedtime:

1. If you need to remember something for tomorrow, write a list or make the things impossible to avoid (put your keys in your shoes, put your phone on your wallet, put the garbage can in front of the front door, or do what I do and set up reminders in Thunderbird (or Outlook, whatever.)) If you think of something you forgot to write on the list, immediately get up and write it down on the list. It will bug you and you WILL forget.

2. Be comfortable. Experiment with different thicknesses of pillows. Have a decent mattress. Use clean sheets. Clean sheets feel awesome. Don't be too hot or too cold. I like it a little cold at night, personally. Helps me sleep better.

3. White noise. I use a white noise generator which is just a fan inside a plastic box, but some people use ocean surf, rain, etc. If you have a loud neighborhood and cars or slamming doors wake you up, work on your soundproofing or white noise. Yes, you might have to pay some money to make life comfortable. Don't be a cheapskate; some things are worth it. Getting a good night's sleep is one of the most important things you can do for quality of life.

4. Don't think about shit you need to do tomorrow. Don't worry about bad stuff that might happen. Don't dwell on past mistakes. You won't remember anything in the morning anyway, so it's not like you're gonna figure some shit out when you're exhausted and trying to sleep that you couldn't figure out when you were wide awake.

5. Relax your muscles. All of them. Your jaw, your back, your neck, your butt. Even your feet. Take a mental inventory of your whole body from your scalp to your toes and make sure they're all unclenched. A stressful life can mean you're clenching your muscles all day, and you may become used to it.

6. Breathe deeply and slowly for a few minutes. Get your heart rate down. You can't just jump into bed with your heart going 90 or 100bpm and expect to fall asleep.

7. Think about something enjoyable, but not sex, unless you plan to have a wank (which can also help, but then you can end up with a mess to clean up.) Good options are: what you would do with lottery winnings, what would your perfect house be like, how would you build a zombie-proof mansion, what beach resort would you like to visit. Think about that TV show or movie you watched most recently, or your favorite. Go through it scene by scene in your mind. 

I have this one where I try to figure out how to find people in a world where all the people have disappeared. I run through a list of all the shit I'd do, like preparing signs to post around in cities, how I'd install a loudspeaker system and lasers on a car, etc. For me, picturing a world devoid of people is pretty relaxing.

A lot of times just reviewing the day's events, as long as they were not stressful, is enough for me to fall asleep. 
BUT, it can't be TOO interesting or you get too into it and you trigger your creative problem-solving brain. So if you tend to think about puzzles or new creative projects or problems from work at night, don't. You'll want to get up and write things down every 5 minutes.

Once you find something that works, use it every night. Your mind will become used to falling asleep to that thing, and it will become a trigger.


Sleep well.

1368284511.0	1e4p7g	YSK How deletion works on a computer (and why you've probably never really deleted anything)	shakawhenthewallsfel	2079	757	209	"So, in light of the news that Snapchat content can still be pulled from your phone even when it's deleted (duh), I thought this would be a useful PSA. I'm not a computer expert but I believe I have the basic idea; any experts can come in and comment further if they want.

OK, so any file you have on your computer is assigned some space on the hard drive. When you delete that file using the recycle bin, all you're doing is telling the computer: ""OK, you can use that space for something else now if you'd like."" But the computer isn't actually going to *do* that until you have new files that it decides to put there. In short, nothing is ever really ""deleted"", it just gets eventually overwritten with something new. So if there's nothing new, the old file is still there.

So, imagine you got some pics or messages on snapchat, and then they were ""deleted."" Those ones and zeros are still on your phone, and while YOU may not be able to see them by default (because that's how the OS is designed to work) people with file recovery software almost definitely can see them if they get access to your phone.

So if you want to actually delete something, what you need to do is (a) tell the computer it can use that space on the HDD and then (b) tell the computer to use that space on the HDD for something else so it gets overwritten. There are lots of programs to do this, and even built in tools in your OS (at least for the desktop OSes, I don't know about smartphones). [Here's a wikihow article that'll give you some places to start](http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Files-Forever). These programs overwrite the file you want to delete with random 1s and 0s, and tell the computer that space is still free.

EDIT: NOPE ~~Now, the bad news is that if you want to be really secure, overwriting it once isn't enough. It's sort of like writing on a piece of paper; if you write new text over your old text people can still kind of read the old text if they try hard enough. Similarly, some software can still read parts or all of old files even if they've been overwritten once or twice, so if you really need to be secure, you should use software that can overwrite the file a few times (I believe the DoD standard is 7). This makes deleting files take a *lot* longer, but it also means that when they're gone they're actually gone.~~

There are even programs that will help you do this with ALL your empty HDD space at once (or just use the erase free space option in Mac's disk util with the right settings). It takes forever, but when you're finished, all those files have been overwritten with random 1s and 0s, so there's very little chance of them being recovered.

(And of course, if you really need to make sure some files on a hard drive aren't seen, the best option is to destroy that hard drive thoroughly. But that may be overkill if you just want to make sure your nude selfies stay deleted)"	t5_2r94o	True

""There are five HDMI cable types to choose from, each designed to meet a particular performance standard""

There are only 5 distinct types of HDMI cables, and if you are using the right type, there is no difference between how the cable will perform, if it indeed follows the official HDMI specification.  The types are as follows:

* Standard HDMI Cable (up to 1080i or 720p)
* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet (same as above with ethernet data channel)
* Standard Automotive HDMI Cable (for use in automotive systems)
* High Speed HDMI Cable (for anything 1080p or above)
* High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (same as above with ethernet data channel)

Any other ""specification"" or ""feature"" listed on a cable's packaging is not going to make a difference in terms of what is being relayed through the cable.  There are different versions of HDMI (e.g.: 1.2, 1.3, etc.) that have added new features along the way, but the fact remains that if a display device connected via HDMI is showing a picture, it is working 100% and the quality cannot be ""improved"" by purchasing a $250 cable with a thicker diameter and unobtainium plated connectors.

Swagger- adj. The quality of walking or behaving in a very confident manner.


You should dress the part:


Wear nice dress shoes. Not toms, or flip flops, or boat shoes. Dress shoes.


Iron your pants, wear slacks or khakis. No jeans, NO BASKETBALL SHORTS for Gotham's sake, and no cargo shorts, just no shorts.


If you have piercings, or tattoos, cover them. If you have gauges, take them out for the application/interview. If you're a lady you can wear ear-rings. I have sleeves, but when I interview I keep them covered. Most of my jobs do not even know about my tattoos even when I am working, but if you feel comfortable you could ask your boss about their policy at the end of the interview once he/she has hired you.


Bring a pen. Bring a pen. Bring a pen.


Make sure youre well manicured, style your hair, wash your face, brush your teeth, clean/trim your fingernails.


Smile.


Eye contact when talking.


Firm handshake.


Clean, ironed clothing. 


Show confidence.


During the conversation, start off by asking the future employer how they're doing, what their day has been up to, something not work-related to show that you care and are an easy person to talk to.


Try not to trash talk your old job, it's basically like you're on a date.


When on a date, you don't trash talk your ex boyfriend/girlfriend the whole time. You can talk about what you want in a boyfriend/girlfriend, but don't trash talk.


Instead of saying things like,


My boss was a dick. He did x y and z.


Say, I am really looking for a position with encouraging management that can help me grow in a positive direction.


Instead of saying that your coworkers were super negative and lazy...


I'm hoping for a new opportunity to inspire my coworkers to work together as a team in a fun, positive, and encouraging environment.


Don't cuss.


Be honest where you are at. Don't present yourself as someone you are not. 


I would recommend not rehearsing before hand, just be honest and who you are going to be to customers/coworkers and let them see who you really are.


Tell your future employer something your passionate about, whether it be volunteering at x, or how you enjoyed spending the summer in y.


I just see a lot of people come in and have no idea what they're doing, and often we just tell people we aren't hiring because of it. 


And anywhere you go to ask for an application, ASK TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER AFTER and introduce yourself, hi my name is I_AM_ENCOURAGER, and I'm just letting you see my face, know who I am, and that I'll be putting in my application later today.

While we sleep we lose a significant amount of water due to respiration and perspiration. We lose over twice the amount of water sleeping than we do resting awake. Which explains part of why we lose weight while we sleep. [Studies show](http://www.livestrong.com/article/402138-how-much-weight-do-you-lose-during-sleep/) some grown men lost 2lbs of water during an 8hour sleeping cycle due to water loss. Every time you exhale you release water vapor (hence why a mirror fogs when you exhale on it). 

So...when you sleep for a longer duration of time you lose even more water, resulting in dehydration, which causes tiredness. So all those years we were told we were groggy or tired because we merely slept too much, are false. We simply just need to hydrate.


**EDIT**

[Symptoms of dehydration:](http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/food/general-nutrition/1013.html)


* Little or no urine, or urine that is darker than usual
* Dry mouth
* Sleepiness or fatigue
* Extreme thirst
* Headache
* Confusion
* Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
* No tears when crying


[Why is your pee more yellow in the morning?](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/putting_the_yellow_in_your_uri.php)

[Hydration](http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/healthy/food/general-nutrition/1013.html)

So, conclusion being... respiration and perspiration contribute to some water loss while asleep, but also consider we are going 6-10 consecutive hours without any water. Water is a vital component to the human body (we are 2/3 water), so if we are not constantly replenishing our bodies it will effect how we function, and we will not be able to perform to our full potential. [Water IS our most important nutrient](http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/WaterUNM.html) after all.

1345477237.0	yiz9n	The Difference Between /r/YouShouldKnow and /r/TodayILearned, and the Mentality of the Hivemind	Eist	1824	598	134	"Over as little time as the last month, I (and I know I’m not the only one) have noticed a change in the content posted in this subreddit.

For me, /r/TodayILearned is a subreddit where one can post something they just learnt and feel that it’s interesting enough to share with the rest of the community. For me, this is not the function of /r/YouShouldKnow. /r/YouShouldKnow should be a subreddit that promotes the betterment of the readers. For example, the [top submission of all time](/www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/q3dq6/ysk_how_to_google_properly/) (submitted 5 months ago) brings attention of how to Google properly. Since nearly everyone uses Google multiple times a day, and this is genuinely helpful information to refine searches, this is something that *you should know*. And it was up-voted accordingly. Great!

[This](/http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/yhv81/ysk_that_when_nazi_germany_desired_a_eugenics/) recent submission regarding the impact of the sterilisation programmes in the US on Nazi Germany eugenics schemes is not something that I “should know”. Yes, it is better for me to know it than to not, but I would strongly argue that I should not necessarily “should know” it. Firstly, I, along with 94% of the world, am neither American nor German. Second, this occurred 80 years ago, and is not even that relevant in the grand scheme of the War. 

The up-votes in this last post are hardly surprising, given the popularity of the perennial circlejerk topic of US bashing in /r/atheism, /r/politics, /r/worldnews, /r/AskReddit, and many others. It is pretty well understood, I think, that the vast majority of Redditors will up-vote anything that conforms to their worldview (and vice versa). 

Because the community can’t control themselves (/r/WTF and /r/bestof are two great examples of good subreddits gone bad), I am asking the mods to step in to stop the decline toward /r/TodayILearned. Please, for the future of this fantastic subreddit, consider removing submissions that *you deem* not something that *You Should Know*.

1339586697.0	uznlh	YSK the following about 911 services	FunInTheSun85	1698	478	409	"Hey there, I'm new to reddit and thought I'd share some information with y'all. 

A little background on me: I've been a 911 operator for 4 years for a large agency that services approximately 750,000 people in an urban area in California. We answer all incoming 911 calls but only handle police issues, fire and medical get transferred directly to the fire department. 

Of course every agency is different and what I say here might not be exactly how it works for other agencies but I'll try to keep it as broad as possible.

So here are a few tips in no particular order that might prove helpful to you if you ever have to dial 911, and some general 911 information:

* The most important thing to give the 911 operator is your location, especially if you're calling from a cell phone. Despite what you see on tv and in the movies, you do **not** show up as a blinking red dot on my screen pinpointing your exact location! Sometimes the location of the cell tower your call is bouncing off of will show up but your location could be anywhere within, say, a 500 meter radius of the tower. Not very helpful if we're trying to locate you. Sometimes I will get a general area of where your actual phone is, but again, I've seen calls with a radius of up to 1700 meters. Pretty useless. Sometimes I can retransmit the signal and get those meters down to about 10 but that is hit or miss, plus if you're in an apartment complex it will not tell me which exact apartment you're in. Doing an actual cell ""ping"" or ""trace"" through the cell company can take anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes. Again, not helpful if you need the cops ASAP. If you really have no idea where you're at, look around for landmarks, numbers on buildings, business names, anything that will help us figure out where you are so we can get you help.

* Calling 911 from a land line will result in your exact address popping up on my screen. If you have a choice between calling 911 from a cell or a land line, go with the land line. If you dial 911 from a land line, even if you don't say a word a cop will respond to your house to make sure everything is ok (at least this is how it works for the agency I work for, as stated above policies vary by agency but this seems to be a fairly common one across agencies). 

* Even if you dial 911 and hang up before you think it went through, it probably still went through. If you dial 911 and immediately change your mind, or dial on accident, do your operator a favor and just stay on the line and tell them it was a false alarm. Otherwise  we have to call back and make sure you're ok, and if you don't answer we have to send the cops to make sure you're ok (assuming it was as land line call and we have an address).

* Answer the questions the operator is asking you. I understand that if you're dialing 911 you're probably in stressful situation and it may be difficult for you, but the quicker you can answer the operator's questions the quicker we can get help to you. I've had people ask me ""Why are you asking me all these stupid questions??"" They may seem inane to you, but there is a specific purpose to all of our questions and chances are, providing us the information we're asking for is going to keep you safer (and the officer safe too).

* Cell phones that have no active service **can** still dial 911, so don't give them to your babies as toys! I can't tell you how often we will get dozens of 911 calls from a disconnected cell phone and it's obvious it's a baby playing on the other end. And since it's disconnected we can't call back to alert whoever gave the kid the phone to the problem.

* Dialing 911 with a non-emergency is a serious issue. Keep in mind there are only so many operators answering calls at a given time and if you dial 911 because you're upset that the neighbor's sprinklers are getting your car wet (yep this is an actual 911 call I've taken), someone with a real emergency may have to wait for me to deal with your non-emergency before getting to them and their real emergency. As I stated above, my agency services approximately 750,000 people and on a **good** staffing day we may have 7 people answering phones. So if only 7 people out of those 750,000 people call 911 because their neighbor's wind chimes are disturbing their peace (again, yes that is a real call one of my partners has taken) someone calling because their baby isn't breathing is going to have to wait. Please limit 911 calls to true emergencies, and if you need non-emergency police assistance call 411 or use google or use a phone book or or or or anything that doesn't tie up a 911 line unnecessarily. 

* When you dial 911 from your cell phone, you get connected to the local law enforcement agency (or basically the law enforcement agency that covers the city where the cell tower your phone hits off of is located). I don't know how common this misconception is but I've received several calls over the years from people who have out of state area codes and think that they connect to the law enforcement agency that covers whatever city their area code is in, so I thought it might be worth mentioning.

* As with 911 operators like I mentioned above, there are only so many cops on duty at a given time. Especially with recent budget cuts, many departments are sorely understaffed which means the response time may increase. Agencies prioritize their calls, which means the cops are going to respond to something like a fight before they're going to respond to something like a noisy party or an illegally parked vehicle. This might seem like a given but I receive countless calls from people complaining about the response time for non-emergencies (especially when it's a noise disturbance) even after they've been told the local units are tied up on an emergency and the response time is going to be extended. Sorry, but we have to deal with the people trying to beat each other to death before we come tell your neighbor to quiet their music down. That's just the way it is.

* EDIT Me continuing to ask you questions doesn't necessarily mean help isn't already on the way. Oftentimes I get your location and basic nature of the emergency, send the call over to get help on the way and then update the existing call with the additional information. Just because you're still on the phone with me answering questions doesn't mean help isn't already on the way.

That's all I can think of right now, if I think of anything else I'll edit with updates. And feel free to ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer if possible."	t5_2r94o	True

The window for treatment is only about 6 - 18 hours, and there is no antidote.  Cats are especially sensitive to the toxins in ANY part of the plant, including pollen. 


I would provide a citation, but it is something you can easily Google to learn more about. Yet, in my experience it seems many people aren't aware of it, and many common floral arrangements contain lilies without any warning about this.


Rest in peace Franklin.


EDIT: I should clarify that the reason getting pollen on the fur is deadly is because cats are very clean animals and can groom the pollen off of their fur, ingesting it. 

EDIT 2: Some have asked to see Franklin. Here is a picture of him (black and white) with his brother and littermate Theodore (orange). Thanks for the kind words.

And if you have a cats... well I'm not quite sure why you would have a cat instead of a dog, but you probably still shouldn't poison them. 

Here's the list of foods that can make your pets ill. Some of them can be fatal: 

* Chocolate-- fast heart rate, hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death

* Ethanol (Alcohol)-- animals are generally more susceptible to alcohol than humans are. The caveats here are similar to alcohol poisoning in humans. 

* Raw yeast dough--  intestinal obstruction and/or ethanol poisoning 

* Hops (beer hops) Edit: the plant, not necessarily beer itself. --  malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results

* Avocados-- possible damage to the heart muscle cells, leading to heart failure

* Grapes/raisins-- acute kidney failure

* Macadamia nuts-- non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain

* Onions, garlic, shallots, etc.--  hemolytic anemia

* Xylitol (sweetner found in gum and other sugar-free things)-- toxic or even fatal liver damage

* Moldy or rotten food-- some molds produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems if ingested by dogs.

* Raw meats and raw eggs-- Salmonella and E. coli can be bad. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.

* Salt-- Large amounts of salt can produce excessive thirst and urination, or even sodium ion poisoning in pets; vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures and even death.

* Milk-- mammals are naturally lactose intolerant 

* Bones-- choking hazard; splintering can cause damage to soft tissues.

Edit:

Because a lot of people are unhappy about the raw meat/bones, it should probably be clarified that a lot of raw meat isn't really healthy for your dogs/cats, especially if they aren't used to it. So if you're pet has been eating 3 pounds of raw meat every day for the past 8 years, you're probably safe; if your pet's food is primarily pet food, then you should probably be careful. 

And about the bones, I know for a fact that bones can splinter and lodge in soft tissues internally. Chicken bones are the worst in my experience, though beef and pork have never made my animals sick. 

Edit 2: ffs, feed your dogs all the raw meat you want. See if I care!

HOW:  
1. Cut the plastic bottle in half.  
2. Mix brown sugar with hot water. Let cool. When cold, pour in the bottom half of the bottle.  
3. Add the yeast. No need to mix. It creates carbon dioxide, which attracts mosquitoes.  
4. Place the funnel part, upside down, into the other half of the bottle, taping them together if desired.  
5. Wrap the bottle with something black, leaving the top uncovered, and place it outside in an area away from your normal gathering area. (Mosquitoes are also drawn to the color black.)

**The many uses of WD-40 include;**

* Protects silver from tarnishing
* Cleans and lubricates guitar strings
* Gets oil spots off concrete driveways
* Gives floors that 'just-waxed' sheen without making it slippery
* Keeps flies off cows
* Restores and cleans chalkboards
* Removes lipstick stains
* Loosens stubborn zippers
* Untangles jewelry chains
* Removes stains from stainless steel sinks
* Removes dirt and grime from the barbecue grill
* Keeps ceramic &amp; terra cotta garden pots from oxidizing
* Removes tomato stains from clothing
* Keeps glass shower doors free of water spots
* Camouflages scratches in ceramic and marble floors
* Keeps scissors working smoothly
* Lubricates noisy door hinges on vehicles and doors in homes
* Gives a children's play gym slide a shine for a super fast slide
* Lubricates gear shift and mower-deck lever for ease of handling on riding mowers
* Rids rocking chairs and swings of squeaky noises
* Lubricates tracks in sticking home windows and makes them easier to open
* Spraying an umbrella stem makes it easier to open and close
* Restores and cleans padded leather dashboards and vinyl bumpers
* Restores and cleans roof racks on vehicles
* Lubricates and stops squeaks in electric fans
* Lubricates wheel sprockets on tricycles, wagons and bicycles for easy handling
* Lubricates fan belts on washers and dryers and keeps them running smoothly
* Keeps rust from forming on saws and saw blades, and other tools
* Removes splattered grease on stove
* Keeps bathroom mirror from fogging
* Lubricates prosthetic limbs
* Keeps pigeons off the balcony (they hate the smell)
* Removes all traces of duct tape
* Some folks spray it on their arms, hands, and knees to relieve arthritis pain.
* The favorite use in the state of New York: WD-40 protects the Statue of Liberty from the elements.
* WD-40 attracts fish. Spray a LITTLE on live bait or lures and you will be catching the big one in no time. It's a lot cheaper than the chemical attractants that are made for just that purpose. Keep in mind though, using some chemical laced baits or lures for fishing is not allowed in some states.
* Keeps away chiggers on the kids
* Use it for fire ant bites. It takes the sting away immediately, and stops the itch.
* WD-40 is great for removing crayon from walls. Spray on the mark and wipe with a clean rag.
* Also, if you've discovered that you have washed and dried a tube of lipstick with a load of laundry, saturate the lipstick spots with WD-40 and re-wash. Presto! Lipstick is gone!
* If you sprayed WD-40 on the distributor cap, it would displace the moisture and allow the car to start. (If I knew what a distributor cap was, it might help)
* WD-40, long known for its ability to remove leftover tape smunges (sticky label tape), is also a lovely perfume and air freshener! Sprayed liberally on every hinge in the house, it leaves that distinctive clean fresh scent for up to two days!
* Seriously though, it removes black scuff marks from the kitchen floor! Use WD-40 for those nasty tar and scuff marks on flooring. It doesn't seem to harm the finish and you won't have to scrub nearly as hard to get them off. Just remember to open some windows if you have a lot of marks.

1327417509.0	oui8l	You should Know There's ongoing social unrest in Hungary, and the media is being actively censored	hunfreedom	1696	612	78	"   You should know that ever since the last elections, the current ruling party in Hungary has been attacking the education system, isolating the country politically, and systematically taking over the media (along with nationalizing other parts of industry). This has gone almost entirely unreported, and will likely continue to be underreported - very few Hungarians speak English well, especially relatively to other European countries where English is mandatory (it isn't here).

   Since they swept elections back in May of 2010 the Fidesz party, led by Viktor Orban (current Prime Minister) have done everything they can to suppress political opposition, most egregiously in that they replaced the individuals in charge of running the major media companies here with government approved cronies. People are afraid to speak against it for fear of arrest or suppression, a relic of the Soviet days - people remember the secret police. To give you some idea of what is happening, one of the first things they did when they took power was rename the country itself to Hungary - from the Republic of Hungary.

   Symbolic, but it says a lot. What isn't outright censored is altered, for instance a recent protest against the government that was additionally aimed at the EU. The way state media reported it, ""pro-government"" protestors had turned out to support the PM as he ""battles"" the EU. In reality it was a protest against *both* him and the EU, but with very little attention on 
Hungary, small misinformation changes like this are slipping away. Education has also been almost completely marginalized. In Hungary, everyone does 12 years of schooling, but you can begin high school early and do as much as 6 or 8 years of it, skipping grades to do more intense work (effectively) if you qualify for it with your test scores. When I was coming up (not that long ago) it was relatively easy to do 6 years (rather than the standard 4) and harder but not impossible to do 8. Now it's almost impossible to get into the 6 year programs, due to the changes they've made to the education system. More than that, though, they've also changed how the university system works. Previously, schools were allowed to give a certain number of their applicants free ride scholarships, based on having high test scores. For instance you may have( this is only an example and not exact numbers) 1,000 applicants and 400 would get free rides. Under the new changes, that has shrunk to 100 or less on average. It's having a devasting effect and my friends and others are facing having to immigrate just to get an education.

   Hungary is in a bad way and the discontent is growing, to the extent that I fear I will see my country break down into revolution soon, it is that bad and people are that angry. I'm writing this because I hope I can shine some attention on what is going on. Ask me anything. I've included some links below, but be mindful that most news out of Hungary isn't that reliable.

1373542279.0	1i2ocy	YSK that 10% bleach is an excellent disinfectant, and can save you money.	tin_str	1560	484	194	"I do cleaning validation studies for microbial clearance on various hard surfaces (porous and non-porous).  10% bleach (that is, 1 part bleach to 9 parts water) is highly effective at clearing not only vegetative bacteria, but mold spores and bacterial endospores.  You can save a lot of money if you make your own solution at home and use it to clean the bathroom, kitchen, etc. You can add a few drops of dishwashing liquid to give it some detergent power.

Mechanical removal of microbial contamination is also very effective (e.g., with wipes).  While we have not specifically tested something like Clorox wipes, it stands to reason that they are more effective than just spraying with a commercial disinfectant and using a sponge.  Wipe in overlapping, unidirectional strokes.

If you really want to make an effective disinfectant, [try this](http://emilyslittlehomestead.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/natural-cleaning-vinegar-and-hydrogen-peroxide/).  It's a combination of vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.  This is basically a homemade version of a commercial sterilant called Spor-Klenz (Steris).  It kills everything. (Ignore the vinegar/baking soda recipe at the bottom, it's not relevant to the vinegar/hydrogen peroxide discussion.)

Remember that when disinfecting, you need a wet contact time for the disinfectant on the surface you are disinfecting.  Simply spraying and immediately wiping off doesn't do it.  10 minutes is a good guideline; respray as necessary to keep the surface wet for 10 minutes.

For example, liberally spray your shower with 10% bleach + a detergent, wait 5 minutes, respray, wait another 5, and then wipe with freshly-laundered cloth rags or paper towels in overlapping, unidirectional strokes.  Use additional spray and an old toothbrush for problem spots, or just some elbow grease.

To save money on paper towels, I recommend buying a big stack of super cheap, white dish towels or rags and using them to clean.  You can just throw them in with a bleach load when they need to be sanitized.  Sponges are little petri dishes with an unbelievably high bioburden.  They are the devil.  If you use sponges, regularly put them in a dish with water and microwave them until the water boils to sanitize them."	t5_2r94o	True

Ntang	1259	255	357	"I was a Peace Corps volunteer in [Cameroon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon), which has the distinction of being one of those countries (like Togo or Guyana) that hardly anyone has ever heard of. I lived there in Central Africa for two years. Following PC, I worked in development across Kenya, Sudan, Mali and South Africa. 

Reddit is smart about so many things, but here in the West, we just don't learn much about Africa, and that's reflected in a lot of the comments I see here. So I thought I'd try to help!

* [Africa is a lot bigger](http://strangemaps.files.wordpress.com/2006/11/africa_in_perspective_map.jpg) than it looks on your usual Mercador map, because it straddles the equator. You could fit the continental U.S., China, Western Europe, India and Argentina in there and still have lots of room left over.

* Africa is not the poorest place in the world. India is. [There are actually more people living in ""extreme poverty"" in India than in all of sub-Saharan Africa](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/14/poverty-india-africa-oxford), according to most studies. India also suffers from much greater rates of child malnutrition. 

* [Most of the French-speaking people in the world live in Africa.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language#Africa) French is at least one of the official languages of 31 countries in Africa, reflecting the widespread colonial influence of France and Belgium. English is the dominant Western language in Ghana, Nigeria, east and southern Africa. In almost all of those cases, ""local"" languages - Yoruba, Swahili, Xhosa, Zulu, Hausa, etc. - are more widespread and better-known.

* Because it is such a huge continent, Africa is not accurately described as a land of civil wars and famines. Civil conflict does exist - East/Southern Sudan, the Eastern Congo and Somalia are well-publicized examples - but the vast majority of the continent is very peaceful. Saying Africa is rife with war because of those examples is like saying the same about Asia because of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Likewise, famine is very rare throughout most of the continent. Most issues with food security are market failures, not problems with supply.

* [Africa has some of the best economic growth rates in the world.](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_african_miracle) Like much of the developing world, Africa is largely ""de-coupled"" from the West economically, such that its economic growth hasn't been strongly affected by our recession. You want a great ROI? Put it in the Ghanaian or Nigerian stock market. Seriously.

* We are not really to blame for Africa's woes. This is some editorializing on my part, but since colonization is really the extent of what most westerners know about Africa, there's a lot of lazy assumptions (paired with rich-country guilt) that we must be to blame for everything that has gone wrong there since independence swept the continent in the 50s/60s. Surely, there is still a good deal of colonial influence, particularly in the Francophone countries - but 50 years after independence, African messes are more accurately blamed on leadership failures. One-party strongman rule has been the norm for much of the continent for a long time. Some strongmen were propped up by the West - Mobutu being one famous example - others were not (Kenyatta, Senghor, Eyadema). This dynamic is changing, but change is slow.

* ""Africans"" are an incredibly diverse group; probably more so than in any other geographic entity on earth. Culturally, racially, religiously, even genetically, there is far greater diversity in Africa that you will find in Asia, and surely in Europe or North/South America. As the birthplace of human evolution, this shouldn't really be a surprise.

* Africa is often most associated with poverty. It's true - much of the continent is pretty poor. But ""poor"" means very different things for different people. In southern Cameroon, no one has much money, but land is plentiful and free and primary schooling is usually available. In Sudan, there is sometimes food insecurity, and there used to be a great deal of violence. In Mali, it's often difficult to find any job that allows you more than a subsistence level of income, but schooling and food is available. Access to basic healthcare varies greatly from region to region, country to country, and even town to town. ""Africans"" are not a large group of unhappy poor people.

* Lions, elephants, gorillas and other big game don't live everywhere. Most Africans aren't actually real crazy about animals like these, and prefer to shoot 'em on sight.

* Nigerians are not all email spammers. They're actually really nice.

* **Do you really want to ""help Africa?""** Don't give your money to some charity. Go visit! Much of Africa is a lovely place, full of very friendly people, and there's lots to do there. Your tourist dollars will do more for the economy than any NGO, and the stories you'll have will (hopefully!) help change the frankly awful and misleading image that Africa has been given. That will do more long-term good than almost anything else.

1363509993.0	1aggke	YSK how to eat (not as easy as it sounds) as instructed by a genuine Martial Arts Master (pictures, proof and explanation inside) 	pie5135	1452	460	176	"**Background (skip if uninterested)**: I am taking a gap year in China before college and am currently at a martial arts school/temple for about 4 months.  The Master here is as real as it probably gets.  He is apparently one of the last genuine descendants of the original Imperial Guard of China.  I'm normally skeptical of this kind of stuff but the guy is turning 60 this year and can outrun, out jump, out fight, and out yell pretty much all of his students.  Plus he has a full head of black hair, and shouts like a fucking BEAR.  He hand picks his students (currently limited to 20 with exceptions for annual ""camps""), and the school is almost fully self-sufficient, with greenhouses for food and fresh water sources nearby.

When I came to the school, life was so radically different that he had to stop me to explain how things were to be done, and surprisingly, how to eat was one of them.  I'll split this into two parts, the **theory** behind how to eat and the **rules** one should follow.

**Benefits** (personal experience):  I've lost about 1kg a week so far even though I wasn't allowed to do any martial arts during the first week (I was told to observe).  Though I expect this to plateau when I get into the rhythm, I was shocked by the sudden loss.  I was initially worried about losing muscle mass, but I exercise every night and feel stronger, if anything.  I feel fantastic and my brain is functioning with an incredible clarity.  I'm zooming through my books, my calc textbook and online coursera classes, and I don't feel any sleepiness after eating anymore.

**Theory**:

*We are designed to eat as if food was scarce*.

* Think about our not-too-distant past.  Food was unregulated, grown by each family, and highly variable.  Thus, when it was available, people would stuff themselves beyond what they required in order to prepare for scarcity later on.

* That our bodies tell us we are full 30 minutes after we achieve ""fullness"" supports this idea

*Half the digestion process is manual*

* Chewing does a huge number of things including adding saliva to help break down food, releasing enzymes to help prepare for digestion and breaking up food to increase the surface area of what needs to be digested (idea should be familiar to anyone who took high school chem)

* ""Food comas"" suggest that too much energy is being used in the automatic system, digestion.  I was skeptical of this, but ever since I've adopted this philosophy, I haven't had a single food coma.

*Food should not be a mystery*

* In most of the civilized world, we just have to trust that the food we eat is actually food.  I'm normally for things like GM foods and more effective methods of producing food, but it's getting to a point where we are sacrificing quality for quantity and actually [waste 40% of it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/22/how-food-actually-gets-wasted-in-the-united-states/).

* Ideally, one should grow their own food to fully understand what they are eating and how to eat.

**Rules** (note that most of these are to create habits, and the actions themselves can usually be dropped after habits are created)

*Food is no longer scarce*

* Chew 30 times per bite.  I'm serious.  I counted 3, maybe 4 bites on average before I tried this, and in reality, your food should become a kind of porridge before it goes down.  Make sure it's evenly chewed by moving it around and don't bite too hard or your jaw will get sore.

* While you're chewing, put down your utensils.  The idea is to stop preparing for the next bite while you're working on the current one.  Take your time and allow your body space between each bites.

* Eat everything on your plate.  Contrary to what you might think, this is supposed to encourage you to put less on your plate rather than eat more.  As a general rule, start out by putting about 1/2 - 2/3rds of what you're used to eating on your plate.

* Really think before you go for seconds.  Do you want more food because you're hungry or because you want to taste more food? If it's the latter, stop.  Your ""fullness"" indicator will catch up with you soon, so just hold off.  A good way to test this is think about whether or not you could finish an entire apple without a single bite being forced.

* If possible, eat everything with chopsticks, including rice.  Chopsticks apparently are ideal for picking up the right bite sizes.  Put too much and the food will tumble off.  

* Set up a time limit (around 20-30 minutes) within which you **cannot** finish your food.  You have to finish afterwards.  On the first day I finished in ten minutes and learned that the punishment was that you had to wash your own dishes with freezing cold water.  It's a good incentive to go slower.

When I first implemented these rules, I felt a mild discomfort about being so conscious of my eating process.  However, a week later and all of these rules became second nature to me.  I also realized my ""fullness"" level is much lower (about half what it was before).  I no longer count my bites, but I know what the consistency of the food should be before I swallow.  

*Food shouldn't be a mystery*

* Cook using basic ingredients.  Most of you won't be able to grow your own food for obvious reasons.  The students here all take part in the growing process, and it's extremely rigorous.  The result is the cleanest food I've ever eaten.  The next best thing is to learn to cook your own food from the most basic of goods.  I'm still working on this one, but I can imagine the benefits are incredible.

It is an encryption technology that piggybacks on existing instant messaging protocols to make your communication encrypted between you and your contacts. OTR is available build-in or as plug-in for several chat clients on most platforms. After exchanging verification, it automatically attempts to instantiate secure chat. If some of your friends don't have OTR, it falls back on regular unencrypted chat. The downside is that you don't have a chat history available online, as everything stored is encrypted, which of course is the entire purpose of using OTR. I'm using the open source multi-clients [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im) on my desktop with the OTR plug-in and [Xabber](http://www.xabber.com/) on my Android device for secure conversations over Google Chat. Installation is a minimal effort and it works great. 
There is a [video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV6-s9o9bVw) showing OTR on Pidgin.

Even though I don't have much activity that might be of government interest, I personally find this important because of principles and an uncertain future of power structures who have endless access to all this data.

Many people ask for non-salted fries so that they get fresh fries.  This does not inconvenience or irritate us at all to make our customers fresh french fries.  However, if there aren't any fries frying, it can take up to 3 minutes to get them.  During rushes, you most likely will be getting fresh fries anyway, as baskets of fries are constantly being fried.

As someone who works around every part of the food preparation process, I am also willing to answer any questions about the workings of McD's.

1349529915.0	111gt0	YSK Some random useful tips	oliveboom	1512	627	137	"Reheat Pizza 
Heat up leftover pizza in a non-stick skillet on top of the stove, 
set heat to med-low and heat till warm. This keeps the crust crispy. No soggy micro pizza. I saw this on the cooking channel and it really works. 

Easy Deviled Eggs
Put cooked egg yolks in a zip lock bag. Seal, mash till they are all broken up. Add remainder of ingredients, reseal, keep mashing it up mixing thoroughly, cut the tip of the baggy, squeeze mixture into egg. Just throw bag away when done easy clean up.

Expanding Frosting
When you buy a container of cake frosting from the store, whip it with your mixer for a few minutes. You can double it in size. You get to frost more cake/cupcakes with the same amount. You also eat less sugar/calories per serving.

Reheating refrigerated bread
To warm biscuits, pancakes, or muffins that were refrigerated, place them in a microwave with a cup of water. The increased moisture will keep the food moist and help it reheat faster.

Newspaper weeds away
Start putting in your plants; work the nutrients in your soil. Wet 
newspapers put layers around the plants overlapping as you go cover with mulch and forget about weeds. Weeds will get through some gardening plastic they will not get through wet newspapers.

Broken Glass
Use a dry cotton ball to pick up little broken glass pieces of 
glass- the fibers catch ones you can't see!

No More Mosquitoes
Place a dryer sheet in your pocket. It will keep the mosquitoes away.

Squirrel Away!
To keep squirrels from eating your plants sprinkle your plants with cayenne pepper. The cayenne pepper doesn't hurt the plant and the squirrels won't come near it.

Flexible vacuum
To get something out of a heat register or under the fridge add an empty paper towel roll or empty gif wrap roll to your vacuum. It can be bent or flattened to get in narrow openings.

Reducing Static Cling
Pin a small safety pin to the seam of your slip and you will not 
have a clingy skirt or dress. Same thing works with slacks that cling when wearing panty hose. Place pin in seam of slacks and - voila - static is gone.

Measuring Cups
Before you pour sticky substances into a measuring cup, fill it with hot water. Dump out the hot water, but don't dry the cup. Next, add your ingredient, such as peanut butter, and watch how easily it comes right out.

Foggy Windshield?
Hate foggy windshields? Buy a chalkboard eraser and keep it in the glove box of your car. When the windows fog, rub with the eraser! Works better than a cloth!

Reopening envelope
If you seal an envelope and then realize you forgot to include 
something inside, just place your sealed envelope in the freezer for an hour or two. Voila! It unseals easily.

Conditioner
Use your hair conditioner to shave your legs. It's a lot cheaper 
than shaving cream and leaves your legs really smooth. It's also a great way to use up the conditioner you bought but didn't like when you tried it in your hair...

Goodbye Fruit Flies
To get rid of pesky fruit flies, take a small glass fill it 1/2"" 
with Apple Cider Vinegar and 2 drops of dishwashing liquid, mix well. You will find those flies drawn to the cup and gone forever!

Get Rid of Ants
Put small piles of cornmeal where you see ants. They eat it, take it ""home,"" &amp; can't digest it so it kills them. It may take a week or so, esp. if it rains, but it works &amp; you don't have the worry about pets or small children being harmed!

**Customs lines** are when you return from an international trip and declare any goods you are bringing back from abroad.

Global Entry works for both types of security, even at some airports where it isn't implemented on the Customs' side.

Ok, it seems this only works on some browsers (Firefox, Opera) and OSes. If it doesn't work for you, try one of these things:

*Opera*: you don't need anything. Click and drag and it'll select.

*Chrome* and *IE*: sometimes works if you click and drag from a few pixels above or below the link (when the cursor is no longer a hand). At one point I thought the Alt trick worked for me in Chrome, but no more. The Menu key is reported to be a replacement (but did not work for me).

*Firefox on Linux*: it works, but it may be overridden by Alt+click being bound to ""move window"". Try Ctrl+Alt together. Or you can change/remove this keybinding from the window-manager configuration somewhere.

1338806849.0	uk0s7	"YSK the real meaning behind the name ""bath salts"" in order to make rational judgements regarding recent acts of violence."	RuskiTavarish	1173	428	231	"First off, you must define what you mean by ""bath salts"". Do you mean the stuff used for baths? Although this is a common misconception, real bath salts have no recreational purpose. Now, if you are referring to one of the many substances that can be found in that unknown powder known as ""bath salts"", then a better question would specify the exact substance(s). Well, most commonly found in these research chemical blends are MDPV, mephedrone, and methylone. After the initial ban of these chemicals, the second generation of ""bath salts"" began hitting the stores. These were primarily composed of naphyrone, and other derivatives of pyrovalerone which is a psychoactive drug that has been used as treatment for fatigue/lethargy.  
  
The real problem regarding ""bath salts"" is that there is no way of knowing what's in that mystery powder you're holding. So if you stop by a local liquor store and buy a counterfeit blend of unknown powder to insufflate, you run the risk of having many negative side effects. Better yet, if you have a prior psychotic condition, well, you might just decide to chew on someone's face.  
  
From what I hace read and seen, it would take much more than MDPV, mephedrone, and methylone to reach an extremely psychotic mental state like the ones we have seen in recent events. These aren't new chemicals; these chemicals have been around for many years. The last releases of ""bath salts"" are of a new formula, and the crap that may circulate the streets has no classification whatsoever. It's most likely a completely unknown mix of powder nowadays so it's ignorant to assume that the name ""bath salts"" means the same thing in all cases.  
  
Also, it's more common for people to end up naked and wreaking havoc because of PCP, so that would make much more sense in Rudy Eugene's case. [Such behavior has been linked to PCP before](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-tVvjVi2m8), even before ""bath salts"" hit the public. Interestingly enough, toxicology reports for Rudy Eugene haven't been released yet, and his family/friends claim that he never used such a thing. So, how can they automatically claim it was ""bath salts""? Likewise, why didn't they make the same claim about Wayne Carter, who threw intestines as a police officer and then stabbed himself?  
  
I don't condone the use of any drug, but if someone decides to use them regardless of what anyone says, I hope they have done enough research to do them responsibly. Ironically, the desire to use these ""drug alternatives"" results from the illegality of the real substances they try to mimic, like cocaine, which is relatively a lot safer.

Edit: spelling   
  

**Update:** Rudy Eugene was not on ""bath salts"", synthetic marijuana, or LSD as police claimed. The toxicology report only came up with Marijuana.  
  
&gt; His body didn't show ""any other street drugs, alcohol or prescription drugs, or any adulterants found in street drugs,"" according to the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department.

1342462609.0	wnllj	YSK what to do if your phone is dropped in water	kakanczu	1159	413	143	"With many of us carrying expensive smartphones, I figured it was worth a short post of what to do if you ever drop your smartphone in water/liquid.

First, get it out of the liquid and immediately take out the battery/sim card if possible. All the instructions that follow **may** only help if the battery is removed. The instructions might still work for phones without removable batteries, but it also may be dangerous for the battery to produce power - at the very least turn the phone off.

If you dropped it in anything other than pure water (salt water, a drink, or even a pool) it will be important to remove the impurities. Distilled water works well - drop it in for a minute to wash out the other liquid. 

Following this, drop it in a bag of rice, packets of silica, or put under a vent that blows light air. Don't go for the hairdryer as this may be too hot for the components. Leave it alone for 12 hours at least (24-48 hours if possible). We're trying to save an expensive device, try to be patient and not jump the gun. After the time, I would say it's fine to see if it works. Place the battery back in and try to boot it up. No luck? Put it back in the bag and wait the full 48 hours if you are not in an immediate rush for the phone. Otherwise it's time for last ditch efforts.

Check your warranty/insurance for your phone - does it cover water damage? If so, turn it in and forget the rest as it may void your warranty. If warranty/insurance does not cover water damage and you're handy enough, take apart the phone. Many phones will have tear down guides on YouTube that will detail the process. Search for your model of phone and some variance of ""tear down guide."" It's usually pretty easy with some basic supplies. Taking it apart only helps, but isn't entirely necessary for this next part.

In my experience, strong Isopropyl rubbing alcohol (90%+) will work best in completely removing impurities and excess water while also drying quickly with no residue. The only reason I recommend this as a last ditch effort is because it can weaken the glues/adhesives in the phone. Either way, if your phone is dead this is definitely worth trying. Drop your phone (minus battery) into the alcohol for a couple of minutes and then set under a light that produces some heat or drop it in a bag of rice/silica packets again. Wait another 12 hours (24-48 hours if possible).

1321441745.0	me9yf	YSK the REAL quick fix for your fucked up sleep schedule	Software_Engineer	1256	528	146	"Look below for the quick fix, here is my preface:

I say ""real"" because I first want to warn you about a quick fix technique that does NOT work.

The ""wrap around"" technique is where you stay up all night until, say, 10pm the next day. You force yourself to go to bed at 10pm from then on.

This doesn't work. If you stay up all night you get ""sleep debt"" and you  will end up requiring more sleep in the following days to pay back your sleep debt. Sleep debt is a real phenomenon that has been discussed in academic journals. FYI If you oversleep one night you cannot expect to be able to sleep less the next night. There are no rollover hours. But if you don't get enough sleep one night you WILL have to repay those hours over the course of the following nights. This is why the wrap around technique is a myth. I have tried it over 10 times and failed over 10 times.  

**HERE IS THE QUICK FIX**

Stop eating. Right now. *Fast* until the time when you want to wake up, say, 7am. Go to sleep whenever you want but force yourself to wake up at 7am. 

At 7am go to a window where you can see the sun and look at it (not directly! but get the sun in your field of vision). Then eat a complete, healthy breakfast.

You can survive 3 weeks without eating so it won't do you any permanent damage to fast until 7am.

Your circadian rhythm is mostly affected by two things:

1.) Sunlight

2.) Meal timings

Even ancient roman philosophers (I'm thinking of Epictetus the Stoic) said that one must first control his eating habits, and then he must control his sleeping habits, (then he controls his sexual desires!)

I have found it relatively easy to force myself to eat once at 7am, and not at all after dinner time. It's easier to change your eating habits than your sleeping habits. Once you change your eating habits your sleeping habits become much easier to change as well.

Also consider if you are getting enough exercise.


**TL;DR** Don't try to stay up all night. Stop eating right now and fast until your target wake-up time. Eat a large healthy breakfast and get some sunlight in your retina at that time. Repeat until sleep schedule has been fixed, it will take only** 1 or 2 days.**

*****

**EDIT** I read the comments and I would like to add some of the things that helpful redditors have mentioned.

Yes, you must force yourself to wake up in the morning. But the point is that it is *easier* to do this if you are hungry and *even easier* as the days go on (by day 3 you might wake up with no alarm clock naturally feeling refreshed). After the first morning your belly will wake you up naturally, expecting a meal. Just like how my cat wakes me up in the morning expecting a meal.

It's winter time so the sun rises late. Daylight savings times helps this however. If you still must rise before the sun consider buying a sun lamp.

Specifically BLUE light is what wakes you up. But any bright light source will stimulate your circadian cycle.

This technique is less effective if you body is used to sporadic meal times.

This technique is consistent with the old adage ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper."" However you might want to consider reading [this article](http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html) that attempts to debunk the adage.

Redditor ""ejactulator"" claims to be a physician and PhD student and vouches for this technique. He says he does it when he travels around the world to avoid jet lag. That is also how I learned of this technique. Instead of using it to cure jetlag, I applied it to cure a fucked up sleep schedule for any other reason.

Avoid using the internet or watching tv in the hour or two before you go to bed. Find another activity to do during that time that does not require looking at a bright screen.

Consider Melatonin supplements but they are not for everyone. If you suspect your body might not react well then talk to your doctor first.

Be warned that fasting slows down your metabolism and while I say above it will not cause you permanent damage, be wary if you have a condition like hypoglycemia.

One morning, however, I had an iced drink on my way to work; once the drink was gone I started crunching down on the remaining ice for about 45 minutes and noticed I didn't get tired the entire time! Excited about the prospect, the next morning I took only a large glass of ice with me and tried again, surprisingly, for as long as the ice lasted I stayed fully alert. I even tried taking a break from eating ice and noticed my eyes starting to get heavy. This morning I took a large travel mug and filled it with ice and made it to work without even the slightest feeling of being tired. Maybe it's the crunching or the cold sensation, whatever it is, from now on when I leave my home in the morning I'll be filling a travel mug with ice for the entire ride to work!

~~Limited ultrasounds.  What is a limited ultrasound?  It's a FAKE ultrasound.~~ (CORRECTION: Just found out a ""limited ultrasound"" is not the same as a fake ultrasound.) **Fake ultrasounds.**  (You don't need to be a medical professional to operate these.)

These people WILL and DO take advantage of ignorance and happily deceive and misinform where it suits their moral agenda.  Guilt and shame are their weapons of choice.


**Lying about the age of your fetus**.  Legal abortions can be obtained within a very limited timeframe (laws vary by state).  If the deadline is near, the ""counsellor"" will lie and say the fetus is older than its real age so the woman will believe she's too late to obtain an abortion.  If it's early yet, the woman will be told the fetus is one or two weeks *younger* than its real age so she'll take the extra time to think over such an important decision--and by the time she makes up her mind, the deadline will have passed.


**Where can Crisis Pregnancy Centers be found?**  There's a good chance there's one near your local Planned Parenthood, sometimes even occupying the same building.  They rely on this proximity to lure and confuse, and whenever possible will intercept or intentionally misdirect women looking for the real Planned Parenthood clinic (the one with the actual doctors).


This is how Crisis Pregnancy Centers reward the vulnerable and often distraught women who put their trust in them: **with lies**.  They represent everything evil and wrong with this kind of morality, often religious-based, that believes it has a divine *duty* to deceive, cheat, and suppress individual choice as long as it is for the ""right"" reasons.


**In short, it's a trap!**



EDIT for **SOURCE**: I understand the skepticism, but as far as I know nobody has undertaken an official investigation into the practices of these CPCs.  Surprised?  You shouldn't be.  This is THE hot-button issue politically and socially in America today.  What independent organization would risk having their funding yanked for proving or disproving such a controversial issue?  Who dares stand up to these bullies?  **Back-up SOURCE**: [abbyk helpfully provides some official sources on deceptive practices by CPCs in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/r6vxw/ysk_how_crisis_pregnancy_centers_lie_to_women/c43du8j) (though none mention my examples above).

I didn't include sources because they're unofficial, ie, my girlfriend works for a Planned Parenthood and these are some of the stories she's been told *directly* from women who have visited Crisis Pregnancy Centers looking for real help--some without even realizing they'd been duped!  Between this and the protestors outside the doors spewing hate at women who already feel like shit (even if it's just to undergo a breast cancer screening, since protestors treat anyone walking into a Planned Parenthood like a child murderer), I have only contempt for these extremist members of the pro-life movement.

EDIT for **GENERALIZING**: I'm seeing a lot of ""maybe *some* places do this, but surely not all...""  On the other hand, maybe *most* places do it, but surely not all.  How are we to know?  Consider this a cautionary YSK, then, to all women, pregnant or not.  If you go to a CPC and find none of this applies, then great.  But this *definitely* applies in *at least* some areas, and since you won't know until you go, at least be wary of the signs.  Go if you must, but be as skeptical there as you are here."	t5_2r94o	True

1324961297.0	nrwz4	YSK: Rosa Parks' actual actions on the Montgomery Bus.		1021	363	82	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks#Her_refusal_to_move

There's a front-page submission at the moment comparing a woman in Israel to Rosa Parks, and I thought I'd take this opportunity to share some info with YSK about a misrepresentation that comes up a lot in how people are told the story of Rosa Parks.

You see, a lot of people know the story that the front seats of a segregated bus (prior to the American Civil Rights Movement) were reserved for white passengers, and the back was for ""colored,"" passengers, to use the vernacular of the day. Rosa Parks is famous because she was arrested for an event of ""civil disobedience,"" which transpired on one of these segregated buses. The common misunderstanding of the event is that Rosa Parks sat in an open white seat and refused to move to the back of the bus when ordered to by the bus driver. This is not was occurred. Rosa Parks WAS in the back of the bus in the ""colored section,"" already. It was considered the rule in these buses that if all the white seats filled, white passengers could take seats in the colored section. If the colored section filled too, white passengers would get priority seating and black passengers would have to stand. If standing room was filled, colored passengers would have to exit the bus. 

Parks was sitting the colored section of the bus and the white section filled. When a white passenger told her to get up because he wanted her seat, she refused. She had worked all day and was tired and felt she deserved the seat, and refused to stand. The rest of the story, I'm sure you all know. 

Is it a huge difference in the story? Not really, I suppose. But I think it's a good little fact that often gets glossed over in a lot of retellings. It also characterizes the situation  a bit differently- she didn't get on the bus with the intention of making a statement. She wasn't some rebel commando who boarded the bus with a mission. She was a regular person, already with fewer rights than white people, who was tired and hardworking and when she was threatened with being stripped of her last right, she refused. Just some good food for thought in the times we live in."	t5_2r94o	True

--------------------------
--------------------------
###An explanation of what's happening:

reddit link syntax allows for title text: If you quote a string of text after you include the link, [then that text will be visible as title text when you hover over the link](/r/YouShouldKnow ""See? Title text!"").

If the link itself is a superscript ""\\\[?\\\]"", then you get the effect.

For added functionality, quick-edit the comment right after submitting and change the link on the defined terms to match the URL permalink of the page the comment is on, with a link anchor (""#"") attached. That way, if someone clicks the link, it won't take them off the page.

I figure this might be helpful for link citations in places such as /r/AskHistorians, but also in jargon-heavy subreddits where users are trying to explain concepts to laypeople.

----------------------------
EDIT:
[The comment system reddit uses is called Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link ""oh hey look you looked at this :)""), and after writing this I learned that formatting *does* support a form of endnotes! I'll explain those here with an example. This:

&gt;     [Link text 1](/url/1/goes/here ""Title text goes here"") [Link text 2](/url/2/goes/here ""More title text!"")

is identical to this:

&gt;     [Link text 1][tag1] [Link text 2][tag2]
&gt;     
&gt;     [tag1]: /url/1/goes/here ""Title text goes here""
&gt;     [tag2]: /url/2/goes/here ""More title text!""

The second format lets you list the link information at the end (really anywhere) of the comment, for a cleaner typing. That means you can take a heavily sourced sentence and write it like this:

&gt;     This sentence[^\[1\]][1] is heavily sourced[^\[2\]][cite2] and the citation tags work in all cases[^\[3\]][all cases citation 1][^\[4\]][that other citation source].
&gt;

I am not joking, I have been working since June of 2012.

1) **Everything depends on the restaurant's location and the manager.**
       At my McDonald's alone, i serve expired red onions, and the grilled onions that we use to make the grilled onion burger are usually made with expired caramelized shit. So, with that; ** THIS IS FAST FOOD, THE FOOD CAN BE PERFECT BUT WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE**
avoid ghetto ones, stay in suburban areas.

Food quality varies and Ronald McDonald gives no fucks.

2) **You can ask for your food fresh.**

cook times are small, if your not in a rush, ask for it made fresh. We will do it most likely, as mostly we don't give a shit if you wait. ESPECIALLY with coffee, the shit sits there.

3) **You have a food allergy.**

Every order you place, say your allergic to something. Especially if your not keen on it. If its something like a Crispy Club, say your allergic to onions. By law, we HAVE to change our gloves, and wipe down the table we make the food with a clean cloth.

4) **If the drink station isnt in view of us, most likely we wont give a fuck.**

seriously, if your in here and have your own cup, i don't really give a fuck if you just walk in and fill it. As long as your not obvious.

5) **Free cups!**
  There is a way. Ask for a cup of ice, or alternatively ask for a cup of water. And see number 4.

6) **Coffee has free refills.**

The rule is, be in the restaurant and we will refill it, but if we don't see you leave, we wont give a fuck

7) **Don't place larger orders.**
  Im not saying this so my job is just easier, if you order 20 McDoubles, and this happens, it increases the chance i make the burger just ketchup and pickles, instead of mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, and cheese. This especially applies on Burger Tuesday, or any other busy day. If your at Burger Tuesday, ask for your sandwich with extra something, or without something. Busy times also increase the chance of getting FRESH food.

8) **Order your fries without salt.**
   Add your own salt, kind of healthier.

9)**The later at night it is, the shitter the food is.**
   like 11pm, it just sits there, unless you order it fresh.

10)**Most common old items**
This can change, day to day.

-Angus
-Mushrooms
-Grilled Onions
-Filet

11)**if it touches the table, don't eat it.**
we only wipe down the table with a rag, sometimes we use this sanitation shit, and well, that's not edible either.

12)**I'm a human being, don't be a dick**
The people differ from restaurant to restaurant, be a dick, the guy might rub his on your food. Plus, it's a good thing to be nice. Dick.

13) **The new McWraps are a pain in the ass to make**
   So please, order them when it's slow.

14)**if your son/child/you got the wrong toy, you can get a different one**

chances are, we'd be willing to go in the back to get them too, as long as your NOT BEING A DICK ABOUT IT.

Jails are holding facilities for individuals awaiting trial or for sentences under a year. They are typically run by local governments and/or sheriffs. When a person is arrested, they are taken to a jail.

Prisons are state or federally run and hold individuals convicted of crimes. One a person has been convicted of a crime, they are taken to prison if their sentence is over a year.

Not that this will save a life or anything, but I was surprised recently that I was the only one in a room full of people to know this difference.


Edit: The specifics of long-term and short-term are this: the recently arrested are held in a jail. Sentences of 364 days or fewer go to jail. Sentences of 365 days or more go to prison.

With a quick Google search, you can find a myriad of recipes and videos on how to make your own. I came across [this one](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/) a few months back, and since then, haven't looked back.

I've always had problems with sweat and odor, and went so far as to get prescription strength stuff like [HyperCare](http://www.drugs.com/comments/aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-topical/hypercare.html) and considered (but didn't get) botox injections a few years back. Although HyperCare does work, it left my skin dry, flaky, and burning at times.

&gt;Be sure to follow the directions about mixing the dry stuff together, separate from the wet stuff, prior to combining all ingredients. The process for warming the coconut oil and shea butter is outlined on [the site above](http://wellnessmama.com/1523/how-to-make-natural-deodorant-beating-the-b-o-with-natural-deo/). Instead of a double boiler, I used a microwave to heat them for about 20 seconds.

&gt;My mixture consists of:
* 3 Tbsp coconut oil
* 1 Tbsp baking soda
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch

&gt;... and the optional additions:
* 1/8 tsp Vitamin E oil
* 1/8 tsp Shea Butter
* 8-10 drops Tea Tree oil


&gt;I put the finished product in a small glass jar that used to hold pimentos, flipped it upside down, and popped it in the fridge. When I need it after a shower, I just open it and apply because the mixture sits just above the lip of the jar. Note that you don't have to keep it in the fridge, but just know that it will liquefy in temperatures over 75 deg F (25 deg C).  You can add whatever oils suit your taste, but I love tea tree for its aroma, and anti-viral/anti-fungal properties.

I was skeptical at first when I made it because we hadn't hit hundred-degree temperatures yet here in Texas, so I wasn't sure it would stand the test. I was also pretty worried it would stain my clothes. However, I'm happy to report that I've had complete success with this recipe, no stains on clothing, and I've even made it for 5 people, which in turn, have made it for others. 

Of course, I still sweat and stink a little when I'm outside doing stuff in midday heat, but it's definitely not as bad as it was when I was using HyperCare and clinical strength deodorant. Also, just like the website I linked first, I have also begun to sweat less, and I still can't believe it. I can actually skip a day and not put any deodorant on, and I don't sweat or have odor even half as much as I did when I was constantly re-applying with the store bought stuff. 

Seriously, do yourself a favor, ~~and stop putting aluminum compounds on your skin that can make you ill.~~

It works!

Edit: Reporting in after running errands in 113 degree F heat. It's still working!
Edit 2: Forgot to mention how amazingly soft my skin is now. It used to be dry, flaky, and irritated. Added bonus!

*Edit 3: Alright guys, I get it. I said something that wasn't fact-checked, and that was an assumption. It's eliminated, so chill. The point I was trying to get across was that if you've never thought of making your own deodorant, and you have issues with products that you've tried that have failed in some way, then I suggest you try this method. What will it hurt? For years I tried different things, and this works well FOR ME. It's obviously not for everyone. Unless you have an allergy to any of the ingredients mentioned, then you're set. See if this will work for you as amazingly as it has for myself and my friends. That's it.*"	t5_2r94o	True

Clearly many people do not know this, and I think it should be spread more. People asked for a brand name, but I don't have any specific, I don't remeber because I've never bought it but I have seen it in pet stores and heared (bad) stories about it, and I can't go to the petstore and take a picture because I'm at the familys vaccation house.

I do remember though, that the cotton-ish beds are usually called things like ""Hamster-fluff"", ""Sleepy hamsters hamsterbed"" and things like that, often with a hamster dressed in a pyjamas sleeping on the front side. If anyone can come up with a good link, I will edit it in here.

The cotton contains strings, that can get attached to the hamsters (or another small animal that builds nests) limbs, wich causes the blood circulation to stop and if the owner doesn't notice this the limb can fall off. It can also lead to broken bones etc.

Another problem, as someone pointed out as a reply to my comment, the bedding can also get caught in the stomach. It can also get stuck in the mouth of the hamster.

If your hamster wants bedding for its nest, ordinary toilet paper works fine and there's no harm done. Remember, the price of the item or fancy colours doesn't matter to animals. 


I tried to do a bit googling on english, I have a few other sources I can give if someone with my motherlanguage is interested(svenska), but this is what I found in english with a fast search.

1294032688.0	ev9k8	10 tips before you sign a housing rental agreement (from a former landlord)	JJJJShabadoo	584	79	268	"It seems like a couple of times a week there are AskReddit threads about landlord problems.  Having been a landlord, and having consulted with a lawyer frequently, and having been a participant in small claims courts regarding housing issues, I would like to share a few pointers that could save some of you a ton of hassle.  

1.  Always, always, always read the entire text of the contract before you sign it.  Your signature is evidence that you have agreed to every term in there.  Don't skim, don't assume that because your buddy recommended the landlord that you've got nothing to worry about.  Read the entire thing.  A contract is a two-way agreement, so if you see terms in there that you're uncomfortable about, you can black them out. 

2.  Document/photograph the premises the second you move in.  Before you open a single box, go through the home/apartment and take pictures of everything.  Don't be stingy, digital pictures don't cost anything.  Go into every room and take pictures of every wall, of every door, every window, every shelf, every appliance from every angle, all the plumbing, all the tiles, etc.  Be particularly thorough about damaged stuff.  Look for dents in the fridge, cracks in the floor, holes in the wall, stains in the carpet, rips in the curtains, etc.  At my last apartment, I took 200 pictures.

And again, upon moving out, document everything.  

3.  In the event of a problem, assuming it is not an emergency, contact your landlord immediately.  Okay, call 911 if there's a fire, but if your heater breaks down, call the landlord rather that calling a repairman.  At most properties, landlords have existing relationships with maintenance people.  If you call in for work done yourself, you're going to cause some real problems.  There is a caveat to this: state laws generally grant landlords a specific amount of time to repair certain things.  A heater, for example, usually has to be fixed within 24 hours.  If your landlord wants you to take initiative to get something fixed, *get it in writing.*

4.  In the event of conflict, go online and look at what the Attorney General for your state has on their web page about landlord/tenant laws.  In answering redditors problems, I've always been able to find these pages (for probably a dozen different states) with &lt;10 minutes of googling.  State laws vary, obviously, and AG's spell out your rights and responsibilities.

5.  Communicate with your landlord.  You may find yourself unable to pay your rent on time one month.  Hey, it happens.  We only ever penalized people who didn't pay and didn't talk to us.  Anytime a tenant would come to us and say they couldn't pay rent on time, we'd listen to their explanation (don't BS, tell the truth), and grant them an extension.  In some of the more extreme cases we did assess penalties, but they were for less than what the contract specified and it was because the tenant was habitually late or because the rent was paid unreasonably late (e.g. a month late).

6.  A security deposit is just that, a **security** deposit.  It isn't a last-month's rent, it isn't for the landlord to draw from each year to clean the carpets, it isn't leverage for them to hold against you because you didn't dust the blinds when you moved out.  It's to protect them against damages.  I've never heard of a state where this was not the case.  If your landlord takes *any* money from your security deposit, it must be documented, and in most cases, the difference returned to you within 30 days.  Check with the AG site for this one.  **Your rent covers wear and tear.**  Having the carpets shampooed once a year is generally something the courts will say is the landlord's responsibility, assuming you  haven't been disassembling a motorcycle in the living room.  In cases where a deduction is made, it must be reasonable.  I once had a landlord take $160 from my deposit because I did not dust the electrical outlets.  This is not reasonable, obviously.  They also cannot deduct for being pissed off.  So, suppose that you wreck a wall in one of the bedrooms.  A contractor comes and patches the wall, repaints it, and sends the landlord a bill for $200.  The landlord can't then deduct $250 for the time it took them to inspect the damage, call the contractor, or anything like that.  They can only deduct the $200, and if you take them to small claims, the court will demand a receipt.

7.  Going to small claims: an unfortunate reality is that too many landlords are dishonest pricks.  You may find yourself getting screwed by one.  Good news, small claims often award some multiple of what you are owed when the landlord steals from you.  Small claims is surprisingly easy.  You go to the court, tell the clerk you want to file, fill out a form, pay a fee, and a date is set.  Here's where your documentation comes into play.  I guarantee you that the landlord is going to paint you as the most awful tenant that ever walked the face of the earth, so you want to have dated pictures that demonstrate otherwise.  If you can get sworn statements from neighbors, that's good too.  Be calm, dress nice, state your case, give the court your evidence.  If you're in the right, you will win.  I watched tenants walk away with $1200 because the landlord screwed them out of $400.  You should know that this will cause some anxiety, probably some lack of sleep, but please do it for the sake of every other person that has to deal with that landlord.  Most tenants are ignorant of their rights and when they get screwed, they walk away.  Don't be passive about it.  

8.  Oral agreements: meaningless.  Get it in writing.  Exception: if you've already been there a while and are going to move to month-to-month tenancy.  Then, at least, you have a history to rely on.

9.  Landlord rights: without a court order, a landlord generally cannot: lock you out (by changing the locks or otherwise), enter your apartment (with the exception of adequate notice for maintenance or in the event of an emergency), or make unilateral changes to your contract.  They can't increase your rent halfway through, no matter what economic hardships they face.  Remember, your contract is a two-way agreement.  They can't change it without your consent any more than you can change it without their consent.

10.  Let your wallet do the talking.  This borders on ethics, but will often get things solved a lot quicker.  For example, if you live in a college town, and you've got parking enforcement that sits and waits for a car to show up without a sticker to boot them (and then charge $100 to remove it), don't stand for that crap.  Go to the landlord and say, ""If I have to pay $100 to get my own car unbooted because my parking sticker fell off, I'm going to deduct it from my rent.""  This is generally something to do for situations that fall outside contract terms.  Be reasonable, and let your landlord have some financial incentive to keep the cashflow coming."	t5_2r94o	True

My sister and I both have 3g phones so we actually weren't using that much data. The verizon rep LIED to me when he said that if I bought a 4g phone out of pocket that I would lose my grandfathered in data plan anyway.

That was a lie! The only way to lose the grandfathered in data plan is if you stop paying your bill or sign a new 2 year contract or give permission to change the plan. Activating a new 4g phone (even if you are using 3g) won't change your grandfathered in data plan.

Edit: You can't call *228 from a 4g phone, you actually have to get a sim card (free of charge) from a local verizon store. Just call and say you got a 4g phone and want a sim card. Ignore them trying to get you off your unlimited data plan, its just a store policy to get people off the unlimited plans and onto the tiered data plans.

**Edit 2: If you have an upgrade and you want to keep your unlimited data plan**: When you become elligible for an upgrade, give your upgrade to a close friend or family member and have them pick out the phone that you want and get that phone activated on their account. Sign the new 2 year contract and make sure they let you keep your unlimited data. Then, later, have your family/friend switch back to their old phone and give you a freshly new ESN clean smartphone that you wanted. Now, you are locked into your 2 year contract with your unlimited data plan and you get to use your ""upgrade"", it just can't be you who uses the upgrade."	t5_2r94o	True

Finally, according to [this article](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/19/cispa-supporters-spend-140-times-as-much-money-lobbying-as-opponents) tech companies spent some $5.7 million opposing SOPA; on CISPA, they spent just $17,000 (with most of that coming from Craigslist, Mozilla and Reddit employees).) Reddit employees are being credited as being part of a large portion of the meager $17,000 that tech companies have spent on lobbyists opposing CISPA.

1364407649.0	1b4g9y	YSK how to disagree.	svcghost	632	155	75	"Disagreeing is an important skill and I went to a talk on this topic by a communications professor yesterday so I thought I'd post a summary of it:

* There are several ways to disagree, most of which are unhelpful or even harmful. Do not get upset, raise your voice, treat a disagreement as a competition, or try to trick or manipulate other people into accepting your point of view.
* The way you're communicating is (at least) as important as the information you're communicating. Perhaps you have a rock-solid formalized logical argument but you make everyone you know hate you. No one's going to be convinced by your argument if no one will talk to you.
* It's not anyone's job to ""fix"" other people. Correcting someone when they're about to make a life-threatening mistake is a moral obligation. Correcting someone when they mess up a minor detail in a story just makes you a tool.
* Treating a disagreement as a competition is a very bad idea.

And here are some practical applications he gave at the end of the talk:

* Suspend judgement until the argument is over. Even if you are convinced of your own correctness, our memory is often faulty and we never have all the answers.
* Agree to have the discussion before actually having it. If you are arguing with someone who doesn't want to argue, you are probably just upsetting them and not helping anything.
* Seek understanding before advocacy. Try to learn what it is, exactly, that they are arguing for. Maybe you guys actually agree and just haven't communicated properly.
* Treat each other fairly. This is a no-brainer but important to remember. Don't treat someone in a way you wouldn't want to be treated.
* Assume good intentions. People rarely do bad things on purpose. Stealing is bad but people who steal are trying to accomplish something good like feeding themselves or having something they need. Other people might seem bad to you, but they probably are trying to do good in their own way.
* Before you respond, repeat back to them what you think they said. It's possible that they didn't communicate properly or you didn't understand them correctly. Repeating their words back to them gives you a second chance to understand them and gives them a second chance to communicate properly.

You are not always being downvoted when you think you are.  Straight from the Reddit wiki:

http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq

&gt;**How is a comment's score determined?**

&gt;According to the same principles as a submission's score.

&gt;A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".  


Keep in mind, though, that complaining about downvotes is a sure-fire way to get real downvotes ;)

""You shouldn't eat that cereal/meat/etc because it has chemicals in it!""
""Margarine has chemicals in it, and is one molecule away from being plastic!""
""This product is perfectly safe for children because it has no chemicals.""

These are all extremely common misconceptions. As the title says, everything and everybody on Earth is made up of chemicals. Water, for example, is one of the most important chemicals of all. The cells that make up the human body are made up of chemicals, as are leaves, trees, animals, food items, stars, diamond rings, tin foil, and everything else you can imagine. 

The most important thing to realize is that chemicals aren't bad. Chemicals form every material thing, and it doesn't make sense to equate the word ""chemicals"" with ""dangerous"" or ""unnatural."" Chemicals, by their very existence, are natural! In addition, it doesn't matter if a certain chemical comes from ""natural sources"" or is synthesized in a factory. At the end of the day, it is the same chemical.

This isn't to say that all chemicals are good. Many chemicals are toxic,  many are explosive, and many are too unstable to even exist. Nonetheless, it is the identity of the chemical of interest (as well as how much of it is around) that determines whether or not you should keep it away from yourself or your children. Lead is quite toxic, but your drinking water will surely contain some of it. And this isn't necessarily a bad thing. There ARE safe levels of lead that can exist in drinking water, and it is unlikely that your drinking water contains an unsafe amount.

If you have any concerts, educate yourself on the specific chemical of interest. Educate yourself on the amounts that are dangerous for consumption. Don't believe in sensationalist stories that are only meant to cause you distress. 

If you have any questions on the matter, I will gladly answer them for you.

While you can find elaborate methods, manuals and courses for this on the internets (especially in the NLP related corners), there is not much to it. You essentially mirror (like you'd see yourself in the mirror) your conversational partner in small ways - how they position their hands and feet, when and how they touch their faces, in which rythm they speak, kind of jokes they make, mannerisms etc, whatever you can pick up on without trying to hard. It's not an exercise in synchronized pantomiming, there can and should be delays of several tens of seconds to not make it creepy. 

You can notice this behaviour happen automatically with people who you like, agree with or when submit to their authority/knowledge/... you get the idea.

Conversely, you can watch other people do the same to you - or not, which can give you clues about their position towards you. And when I'm saying clues I mean *clues* - a million other things can be happening in your friends mind which influence their body language or speech patterns.

Now why I'm telling you this? For one thing, so you can learn about yourself and the most important level of communication that our brains unconcsiously uses. But mainly so that you can fuck with salesmen. They know about this shit, and try to use it to establish fast rapport, so you'd be more receptive to their propositions. It's real fun to watch them squirm trying to mirror you when you change your body language in ten second intervals ..."	t5_2r94o	True

Its called the 20 second rule.  If you have a 20 second barrier in the way of doing something, it makes it massively unlikely that you will do it.  Conversely if you want to train yourself to do something, make sure there are no 20 second barriers in the way, and it will be easy.

So two examples...

1. I want to reduce the amount of time I spend on reddit.  

Log in to your router, set up reddit.com on your firewall list.  Change your password to a 20 character string, write it down and attach it to the router.

You are now free to reddit whenever you want.  But because it will take more than 20 seconds to allow you to do it you'll get bored before you get there and end up doing something useful instead.

2. Exercising in the morning.

This may seem like it should be harder because its a positive habit you have to learn not a negative one to avoid but it isn't.  Its actually really simple.

Before you go to bed, pack your bag for the gym, get out your trainers and put them next to your bed, and then get dressed in your full gym kit.  I mean everything, socks included.

That way when you wake up, you can just slide out of bed, put your trainers on, and you're already halfway to the gym.

You would be amazed how easy it is then to go the rest of the way.

1373045242.0	1hp8iz	YSN: You can use Google Voice as a free dedicated complete land-line phone.	imozmo	612	206	63	"By combining the free [Google Voice with the free number](http://google.com/voice) they give you and an inexpensive device called the [OBi 100](http://obihai.com/product-primer.php) there are other models available, but this one is the cheapee basic. The device is the only thing that has a cost. As you know You may make/get unlimited US/Canada calls at no cost.

**It is important to note that 911 Service is unavailable on Google Voice.**

With this combination you have free home phone service on any ol' plain telephone(s) you like. You use the OBi device between your router and a phone line. You must also go online and configure the device to work on the OBi website.

I hooked up a wireless phone that has a wireless ""mate"" giving me two telephones in my home. I am told that you could simply plug the phone line into the wall and that would light up the little copper network in your home. I've not tried that, so it might be BS.

I could see this as being very handy for people that run a small business, someone who is sick of getting absolutely schooled by the cell companies, and those that might enjoy having a back-up phone. (particularly me).

I apologize if my very first post here came out as spammy. It wasn't ment to be. I just think this is worth knowing. 

I have learned so many cool things since discovering this sub. I thank every one of you all for that!

Edit: It is important to note that if you require a Hard-Line phone that has the same reliability standards dictated by law for hard-lines, this ain't it. 

**/u/markekraus states:**
*It is important to note that internet voice services are not ever equivalent to land lines (currently). Traditional land line providers are required to meet a higher availability (major disaster notwithstanding) than your electricity provider, internet provider, IP phone provider, and voice gateway provider. These things combine to make internet phones nowhere near as reliable as land line phones. and considerably unreliable for emergencies.*

If you go to start your car and it doesn't turn over and you're sure the battery is charged, it's likely because your started is broken.  Have no fear.  As long as you're driving a standard, and your not parked facing uphill, you're going to be alright.

Step 1: If your facing down a hill, take off the emergency brake and put the car in neutral.  Get up a little speed rolling down the hill.  (If you're not on a hill, hopefully you have some friends with you that are willing to give you a bit of a push) 

Step 2: Push the clutch to the floor and put the car in 2nd gear.

Step 3: Turn the key in the ignition to the ON position.

Step 3: Once, you have a bit of speed, let out the clutch.

Step 4: Your engine should turn over and once it does, push the clutch to the floor and rev the accelerator a bit.

Your vehicle is now running.

Final step: Go get a new starter installed because starting a car like this every time sucks ass.

Even if your starter isn't broken, it's worth trying because being able to do this can prove to be useful."	t5_2r94o	True

1341569582.0	w4g6v	From a telemarketer: How to REALLY get rid of telemarketers.	ieatouttrashcans	612	217	402	"As the title suggests, I AM a telemarketer. Firstly, I want to be informative, and secondly, I want to tell you how to be rid of us.

First bits: I want you to be aware. The second bit will be all about how to get rid of us(as a person, I don't like Telemarketers either, but unlike you, I'll listen to them, until I'm sure they won't interest me.)

1. We're not a scam. Well, okay....not ALL of us.

There are a lot of fields of telemarketing. Some you've asked for, and some you haven't. Most of us wouldn't be calling if not for a reason(this will be made clear later.)

2. We're sorry for interrupting dinner.

We're on an automated dialer system. We work hours that (most of) you don't work. Myself, I'm in PST, and I work 3pm-9pm(or 1500-2300). My counterparts work 6am-2pm(or 0600-1400.) When we call is when you come up in the computer system. When we call inconveniently, it IS by accident, and we feel bad. So do our supervisors, which is why we offer to call back later.

So, that out of the way, here's the rest.

1. First off - Let's get rid of telemarketing calls.

First step - [Put your number on the National Do Not Call List](https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx)

There you go. We're done.

Well, maybe not....

Step 2:

2. You're going to still get calls.

There's a reason for this. With most places, you're allowed to sue for this, but there are exceptions to this rule. I'm not going to go over all of them, because if you're smart enough to be a redditor, you're smart enough to do research. If you need a starting place, fcc.gov is a good place.

The basic breakdown is this:

*A charity(ie MADD or Special Olympics)

*Someone you've done business with (Sears with their stupid Shop Your Way Rewards program or A school you've been interested in.)

No matter what happens, here's your opportunity:

You're on the DNC(do not call list)

Great, we respect that. We still have a reason to call. When you ask us personally to stop calling, we're legally obligated to stop calling. Remember our number, though, because a lot of people think that it's all the same person. In my organization, when you ask for us to stop calling, we're watching our asses and do it. Pay attention to the exact phone number. WE don't call again, and we're tired of being accused as such.

Working as a waiter was easier than this. We bow to your every wish, but you need to tell us to stop calling, or we keep calling. ""I'm not interested"" means that we call you again in six months.

If you're on the DNC and ask us to stop calling, we do, because we could get sued otherwise. Before you get that bright idea, the phone companies would back us up, proving that we stopped after you asked us to.

Also, we're Customer Service agents. We're not the dicks. We're doing our jobs. Don't be mean to us, because we really do want to help, and when you ask to be taken off of our list, we're glad for you. Don't be an asshole, and tell your friends and especially your elder family the same.

It boils down to this:

DNC

After that: Please take me off of your calling list.

Also, read in to the exemptions. While my departments sells education(Industrial Maintenance/Electricity, CCNA, CCNP, MCITP, Oracle, Medical/Legal Transcription, etc.) you can write us off or listen and schedule a callback while you research. I was skeptical of my company too until I researched.

Several sources also include a fifth rule.  The fifth rule tends to vary, but the following have been used:
- Always keep your gun unloaded until it's ready for use.
- Always wear proper eye and ear protection when shooting
- Act as though there is no such thing as a non-lethal shot.

1366584363.0	1ctrh4	YSK how to make a tourniquet.	Panda_is_Delicious	530	147	61	"In light of the recent attacks in Boston, I realized that if I had been there (I missed it by 10 minutes) I wouldn't have known how to make a tourniquet.

According to the [army study guide](http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/Prep_For_Basic_Training/Prep_for_basic_first_aid/apply-a-tourniquet.shtml):

DANGER: A tourniquet is only used on an arm or leg where there is a danger of the casualty losing his life (bleeding to death).

A tourniquet is a constricting band placed around an arm or leg to control bleeding. A service member whose arm or leg has been completely amputated may not be bleeding when first discovered, but a tourniquet should be applied anyway. This absence of bleeding is due to the body's normal defenses (contraction or clotting of blood vessels) as a result of the amputation, but after a period of time bleeding will start as the blood vessels relax or the clot may be knocked loose by moving the casualty. Bleeding from a major artery of the thigh, lower leg, or arm and bleeding from multiple arteries (which occurs in a traumatic amputation) may prove to be beyond control by manual pressure. If the pressure dressing under firm hand pressure becomes soaked with blood and the wound continues to bleed, apply a tourniquet.

WARNING Casualty should be continually monitored for development of conditions which may require the performance of necessary basic lifesaving measures, such as: clearing the airway, performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, preventing shock, and/or bleeding control. All open (or penetrating) wounds should be checked for a point of entry or exit and treated accordingly.

The tourniquet should not be used unless a pressure dressing has failed to stop the bleeding or an arm or leg has been cut off. On occasion, tourniquets have injured blood vessels and nerves. If left in place too long, a tourniquet can cause loss of an arm or leg. Once applied, it must stay in place, and the casualty must be taken to the nearest MTF as soon as possible. DO NOT loosen or release a tourniquet after it has been applied as release could precipitate bleeding and potentially lead to shock.

Improvising a Tourniquet.
In the absence of a specially designed tourniquet, a tourniquet may be made from a strong, pliable material, such as gauze or muslin bandages, clothing, or cravats. An improvised tourniquet is used with a rigid stick-like object. To minimize skin damage, ensure that the improvised tourniquet is at least 2 inches wide. 

WARNING The tourniquet must be easily identified or easily seen. 

WARNING DO NOT use wire or shoestring for a tourniquet band.

Placing the Improvised Tourniquet

a. Place the tourniquet around the limb, between the wound and the body trunk (or between the wound and the heart). Never place it directly over a wound, a fracture, or joint. Tourniquets, for maximum effectiveness, should be placed on the upper arm or above the knee on the thigh

b. The tourniquet should be well-padded. If possible, place the tourniquet over the smoothed sleeve or trouser leg to prevent the skin from being pinched or twisted. If the tourniquet is long enough, wrap it around the limb several times, keeping the material as flat as possible. Damaging the skin may deprive the surgeon of skin required to cover an amputation. Protection of the skin also reduces pain.

Applying the Tourniquet.

a. Tie a half-knot. (A half-knot is the same as the first part of tying a shoe lace.)

b. Place a stick (or similar rigid object) on top of the half-knot

c. Tie a full knot over the stick

d. Twist the stick until the tourniquet is tight around the limb and/or the bright red bleeding has stopped. In the case of amputation, dark oozing blood may continue for a short time. This is the blood trapped in the area between the wound and tourniquet.

e. Fasten the tourniquet to the limb by looping the free ends of the tourniquet over the ends of the stick. Then bring the ends around the limb to prevent the stick from loosening. Tie them together on the side of the limb

NOTE Other methods of securing the stick may be used as long as the stick does not unwind and no further injury results. NOTE If possible, save and transport any severed (amputated) limbs or body parts with (but out of sight of) the casualty.

f. DO NOT cover the tourniquet-you should leave it in full view. If the limb is missing (total amputation), apply a dressing to the stump. All wounds should have a dressing to protect the wound from contamination.

g. Mark the casualty's forehead with a ""T"" and the time to indicate a tourniquet has been applied. If necessary, use the casualty's blood to make this mark.

h. Check and treat for shock.

i. Seek medical aid.

1367344812.0	1dfase	YSK How to drink/make tea like a Chinese person (Chinese table manner, etiquette)	krizalid70559	840	500	263	"Saw a post here on YSK about how to make tea like a British person, decided to make one for Chinese tea drinking - thanks to Chickpea123uk.

First off, let's start with the basic tea drinking:

- Put loose leaf tea in a teapot.

- Put boiling water in teapot.

- Cover teapot.

- Wait for 3~5 minutes.

- Pour some tea from the teapot to your cup, if the color is not rich enough, you should throw the tea away as it is not as tasteful.

- Depending on the tea, you might want to dispose of the whole pot because the second brew is better for some tea.

- If you accidentally put too much loose leaf tea into the tea cup, you may dilute your tea with some hot water.

- Whenever your tea is cold, you should pour it out/dispose of it; only drink hot tea.

- 95% of the time, we don't use sugar/milk or any condiment in our tea.


Note: There will be loose leaf in your cup.  You don't finish the entire cup; by that I mean whenever you are close to finish, you should pour yourself some more tea.  Your tea cup should never be empty, as the loose leaf tea is at the bottom.

Tea Drinking (Yum Cha) and Dim Sum - You can read the [Wiki here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum)

Some basic table manner:

- The youngest person (except children) should always be pouring tea for everyone.  You always pour tea to the oldest person first, work your way to the younger people.  

- When pouring tea, use your left hand to cover the lid and right hand to deliver the tea.

- Pour your cup **LAST**.  Never pour your cup first.  

- Only pour tea in tea cup, not a glass.

- After you finish pouring the tea, put the teapot down, and make sure the pouring end (the spout) is not pointing at anybody (impolite), and the handle should always be facing you (implying you will always be pouring)

- Usually you don't pick up the tea cup to pour tea in; unless you have really shaky hands.

- When someone pour tea to your cup, you need to knock on the table with your index and middle finger.  You use your two fingers to imitate a kneeling position and knock, which represents an appreciation by kneeling (so you don't really have to kneel every time someone pour you some tea).

Food ordering (dim sum):

- Most of the Western table manner applies here.

- When you run out of tea during Yum Cha, you lift the tea pot lid and the waiter/waitress will fill it with more hot water.

- Before eating the last piece, ask everyone on the table if they want it.

- If you are eating rice or noodle, don't stick your chopstick in the rice/noodle and leave it idle (that is very similar to how Chinese people worship the dead/God/supernatural, which they stick incense into sand and light it to worship them).

- If there is a favorite piece of food on a plate that you like, but it's buried under... that's too bad.  You don't dig around food; so you will have to wait.

- If there's a dish on the table that you really like, but it's really far away from you (you basically have to stand up and get it), then don't.  Most of the time, the table will have a spinning top that lets you rotate the food.  If it doesn't, then you shouldn't be standing up to intrude.

- Don't put the chopstick in your mouth.  Don't suck it.  Don't lick it.

- When ordering food (Dim Sum), you usually wave to the cart so the old lady will come your way.  You don't go chase the cart for food (unless you are a kid).  In Hong Kong this step is unnecessary because you order Dim Sum via a order sheet.

- When you are done eating, don't play with the chopsticks.  Either leave them flat on the table, or on the plate.  You usually don't put it on the bowl, and you definitely don't leave it in the food.  You don't separate the chopsticks.

- Don't shake your leg.

- Try not to do too much with your hand (I guess that would be the same as Western Table manner).

- Eat on your small bowl.  Dispose of the bones or others on the plate.  Only noobs eat on the plates.

- Always try to pay... lol.

That is all I can think of for now, I will add some more if I can think of anything else.  Hope this is not too useless for everyone here."	t5_2r94o	True

Accreditation is the #1 way to tell if you are attending a 'real' college.  If your school is [regionally accredited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_accreditation) then it is almost certainly a real school.  If it is [nationally accredited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_accreditation) then you should consider this school 'not' accredited; this may seem harsh, but many employers will consider this degree as not acceptable or even a liability.

Also, if you are trying to get an engineering degree, make sure it is [ABET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABET) accredited.  Not being ABET accredited may not necessarily mean it is a worthless degree, but you aren't really considered an 'engineer' with out this accreditation.

* Website

This is an easy check, but it's not bulletproof.  If the website is not .edu, it's a pretty sure bet that this is not a real college.  However, even if it *is* .edu that doesn't mean it's accredited or a good college.

* Credit transfer

This is a huge red flag.  If other colleges won't accept credit from this school, you almost certainly don't want to go there.  If you are at all unsure about the school check this.

* [for-profit](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zaid-jilani/the-bipartisan-force-behi_b_1326367.html)

For-profit colleges are the reason this is becoming a problem.  Examples are:

* DeVry
* University of Phoenix
* ITT Tech
* Lincoln Tech
* American City College.
* Full Sail University

These are scams, and a 'degree' from one of these places will give you nothing but debt.  If anyone with a degree from one of these schools wants to give pro/con testimony, that would be great."	t5_2r94o	True

I haven't got a link to a source but if someone here has read his books about slavery you can probably confirm this.

When they added together all the slaves that democratic countries that are not in war had and took the absolute minimum, it was 12 million. If you then add dictatorships and countries in war with prisoners of war the number would probably be around 100 million.  
He said that the main reason not many knew about this was because if a country started talking about the horrible slavery that is going on, they would have to act.  
Somewhat unrelated, but he also talked about how Sweden (among others) sold an incredible amount of slaves and also had many kidnapped by other countries and sold. The word ""slave"" comes from the east european/russian people(a people there called themselves something similar to slaves).

But I discovered that you can block the app *if* you can find the link to the app's page.  Here is a list of some of the ones I know of...

- Yahoo https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=194699337231859
- Washington Post Social Reader https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=225771117449558

- The Independent: https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=235586169789578

Go to the app's page using the links below and click the ""Block App"" link.  Ta-da, no more spam from the app in your newsfeed!  Please add comments about any other ones you can find and I'll add them above.

**How to Find the URL to Block Other News Apps**

Here's what you have to do... When you see a story from one of these evil apps in your newsfeed, go ahead and click the link and you'll be taken to a page with a URL that looks something like this:

  https://www.facebook.com/dialog/permissions.request?app_id=225771117449558&amp;display=page...

The only part you are interested in is the app_id, so select and copy that app_id number (it's 225771117449558 in the example above).  Then enter this URL:

  https://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id= (followed by the app_id number you copied from the original URL)

Then post a comment with the URL here so I can add it to our list above to make it easier for other people to block the app as well.

Note:  Whatever you do, please don't add these apps to your Facebook profile!  If you do you're handing over your email address and other personal info, rewarding them for this behavior, and perpetuating this system.  If you have friends who have added the apps, contact them and ask them to remove the apps.  If enough people do that we can force them to stop this annoying ""Open Graph"" crap.

1303801871.0	gxlxb	YSK some things about your average ER visit.	SpaceBoy64	382	59	199	"I work in an ER and I wish that I could hand out a pamphlet to everyone that comes in to let them know a few things.  Unfortunately, there are many legal issues stopping me from doing so.  So to better understand your woes, here I go:

1) There will be a wait.  A *long* wait.  This is mostly because of a lack of rooms/beds.  I usually give the restaurant analogy of table seating. We have to get someone out before we get you in. We can't just pump you full of dilaudid in the waiting room and send you home.  There might be a serious issue we have to address.

2) I know that you're out there for a long time but please don't send someone out for McD's if you say you have been throwing up all day.  It could possibly make things worse or delay a test you may need.

3) Speaking of long waits: If we let you sit out there for hours it probably means that you are not dying. There is an initial assessment done when you first check in and we will decide what your priority level is.  Basic rule of thumb that I've noticed: If you can repeatedly ask us why it's taking so long then you are not in mortal peril.  The ones that are really sick don't talk or move or complain.  To sum up-- If we don't rush you back immediately, you will probably be ok.  

4) If you are female under the age of 60 we will most likely need to know if you are pregnant, even you are 1000% sure there is no way it's possible.  You might have to pee while waiting, so ask for a cup so we don't have to delay things longer.

5) We know that your family and friends are important to you, but this isn't a nice day out in the park, this is an ER.  Please limit your visitors to one if you must bring someone.  And for the love of Cheezus leave your kids at home.  ER floors and walls are about the filthiest surfaces in the world.  Yes, we clean them ALOT. And thoroughly.  But it doesn't matter. It's gross.  You don't want them crawling around on it.

6) If you really can't breathe, you can't talk.  Period.

7) Taking an ambulance will not get you seen faster.  Think of it as a limo ride to the hospital.  I've seen women take ambulances for bad menstrual cramps.

8) Certain things need to be done to figure out what is wrong with you.  Please just follow what we ask you to do.  We don't live in Harry Potter land and can just magically fix you by looking at you.  We'll need blood, scans and yes you need to be in a gown.

That's all for now.  It's late.

Basically you sent up long term ""goals"" that you have and want to save money for. For myself, I currently have 3, one for my car insurance, one for my renter's insurance, and one for my new computer I want to build.

What happens is, every 2 weeks (you can do this with any frequency) on the day after payday, SmartyPig pulls $30 for my car insurance, $10 for my renter's insurance etc out of my checking account. The goal is that at the end of 6 months (I get a discount for doing this instead of paying monthly), I'll be able to pay them entirely. So when my $360 car insurance bill comes, I don't say ""Oh shit, I don't have that right now."", I simply empty the account, pay the bill, and start it over again.

You can create as many ""goals"" as you want, which is much easier to keep your finances straight for these types of longer-term goals. You earn 1% interest on the account (not much, but it's something).

Also, if you are saving for something like a home improvement, sometimes you can get a ""cash bonus"" for redeeming for a gift card. So you may get an extra 5% by converting the cash into a Home Depot gift card.

If you want to join, you can PM me your email and I'll get you an invite (*Note: You can join for free you do not need an invite*), and I think I get like $10 towards my goal if you use SmartyPig for a month. I'm not really too worried about this though, just wanted to pass along this cool tool!

A couple years later the battery shot and the CD drive wouldn't work, but these were things I could deal with.  About a month ago, however, it decided to shut down and not turn back on.

I took the pouty laptop to the nearest Apple store genius bar.  The Genius found out the ethernet port was also broken (but who uses that?) and that repairs ""should"" be covered under warranty.  Off went the abused MBP to Apple hospital.  

A couple days later I received a voicemail saying that parts were broken due to drop damage, which is not covered under warranty, and repairs would be $1350 and if I could call back to confirm that I still want the repairs done. WHAT?!  

I call back and Greg the Tech Rep answers.  I explain my situation, say that I don't think I've ever dropped my computer but it's been well-used and shit happens, and could you please send it back before Apple charges me for the equivalent to twice my rent.  

This is where miracles happen.

Greg says, ""hold on, I have a jpeg here of the ""damage"" and I don't see any drop damage.  Can I put you on hold?""  I oblige.  Ten minutes later he comes back, ""Yeah I inspected the device myself and I don't see any evidence of drop damage.  I'm going to call the Apple store and arrange something.""  Ten more minutes and he returns.  ""Hey [my name], because you were so calm and understand, I arranged a one-time, full repair for NO COST.  You'll receive your device in 2-3 business days.""  2 to 3 business days later, I received my computer.  It had an original refurbed body, with old lid attached and my hdd.

The aim of this post will be to provide an objective answer. A PubMed search and some Googling turned up several studies in which the penis was measured by medical personnel. In the following list, I will report averages for erect and flaccid stretched measurements. For newbies unfamiliar with the acronyms, please see the [glossary](http://penis-enlargement-faq.thundersplace.org/index.html). When I do not indicate BP or NBP, this is because the study abstract failed to specify such.
    
    
Group 1: Studies specifically aimed at determining average penis size
    
[Study 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8709382) - 80 American men:
NBPEL (100% erection induced by drug injection) = 5.08"". FSL = 4.88"".
It appears (from reading another source) that the 5.08"" figure is non-bone pressed.
    
[Study 2](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/WolfFiles/story?id=90588) - 300 men, ""college-aged"":
NBPEL = 5.88"". EG (midshaft) = 4.97"".
    
[Study 3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11223678) - 3,300 Italian men, 17-19 years old:
FSL = 4.92"".
    
[Study 4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?itool=abstractplus&amp;db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=abstractplus&amp;list_uids=15510185) - 271 Jordanian men:
FSL = 5.31"".
    
[Study 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=17151695)   - 1500 Iranian men, 20-40 years old:
FSL = 4.56"".
    
[Study 6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12350491)  - 52 Greek men, 19-38 years old:
FSL = 4.80"".
    
[Study 7](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17568760)  - 301 Indian men:
FSL = 4.28"". A subset of 93 of these men were measured erect, and the average was 5.12"".
    
[Study 8](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0021-75572007000600008&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en)  - not included in calculations or discussion below) - 84 Brazilian men, 18 years old:
BPFSL = 5.71"". The 90th percentile for BPFSL among these 18-year-old men was approximately 6.61"".
        
    
Group 2: Studies in which average penis size was not the primary goal of investigation (Some guys have expressed concern that doctors fake data in penis-size studies in order to relieve men's insecurities. The following studies should not be prone to this criticism.)
        
[Study 9](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~msbm/list_of_publications/articles_in_journals/IJIR_12_328-333.pdf) - 55 Israeli men, 21-78 years old: BPEL (100% erection induced by drug injection) = 5.35"". EG (base) = 4.29"". BPFSL = 4.92"". 
        
[Study 10](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11182344) - 111 ""younger"" (18-19 years old) and 32 ""older"" (40-68 years old, for whom 100% erection was induced by drug injection) German men: BPEL (young men) = 5.70"". BPEL (older men) = 5.58"". The full text of the article specifies that these measurements were bone-pressed.
    
[Study 11](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12230622) - 104 British men, 17-84 years old:
FSL = 5.12"".
    
[Study 12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12937799) - 123 Korean men, ""early 20s"" in age:
BPFSL = 4.21"". NBPFSL = 3.78"".
    
[Study 13](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12068220&amp;dopt=Abstract)  200 Turkish men, 20-22 years old:
NBPEL = 5.01"".
    
[Study 14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=17191423&amp;query_hl=25&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum) - 115 Nigerian men, 30-65 years old:
FSL = 5.30"". Range: 2.95""-7.68"".
    
[Study 15](http://www.osbon.com.au/fraiman.pdf) - 100 American men who had had a prostatectomy (47-74 years old) and 130 who had not (47-74 years old), with erections induced by drug injection if needed:
BPEL (prostatectomy) = 6.06"". BPEL (no surgery) = 5.98"". EG (prostatectomy) = 4.65"". EG (no surgery) = 4.57"". 
    
    
Out of these high-quality studies, four included a measurement of erect length, the statistic that most interests men at Thunder's Place. Three of these four included direct injections of a drug into the penis to induce a 100% erection -- so their numbers can't be dismissed as too low due to measurement anxiety. The four studies reported average erect lengths ranging from 5.35"" BPEL to 5.88"" NBPEL (the latter number comes from college students on spring break in Cancun, who probably had small fat pads). For the three studies that did not include erect measurements, we can estimate that the erect figure would have been about 0.25"" longer than the reported stretched flaccid length, judging from the differences in studies that included both FSL and EL. For these three additional studies, the average erect length can be inferred to range from 4.46"" BPEL to 5.37"" (might be NBP or BP).
    
Studies in which size is verified by a third party, therefore, have consistently turned up averages below those of self-report studies. For example, the famous Kinsey self-report survey found an average NBPEL of 6.16"", while a Durex online survey showed an average of 6.4"" NBPEL. In my opinion, to trust men's anonymous self-reports over the data of seven objective medical studies demonstrates penis-size paranoia -- something to which we are prone here. If we look at the objective data instead, the average erect penis length appears to be no greater than 5.5 - 6.5"" BP -- and may even be smaller.
    
    
Disclaimer: I am not trying to suggest that enormous penises do not exist. They do -- and some men are born with them. But for those who were not born with a huge one, and who instead aim to build one through PE, I think it's important to establish a reasonable standard of what ""average"" is, so that size-paranoia does not continue to haunt them even after they have reached a truly large size."	t5_2r94o	True

As most of you know, earlier this year Verizon made it so that grandfathered in unlimited data users are required to move to a shared data plan. I wasn't looking forward to this change when I went in to get the Droid DNA last week. When the lady at Verizon came back she told me I had used 18 GB already (idk how) and I was only 3 weeks into the month. She went back to ""see if she could do anything for me"", and when she returned this is what she told me:

Because I had a line on our account that wasn't being used, I was able to move my upgrade from my phone to the disabled one. Then when the disabled line is upgraded to the new phone that you want, your plan does not need to change. (something to do with the fact that it's not being used.) You might be able to temporarily disable a line in order to do this, and then re-activate it afterwards, but I'm not sure. Then all you need to do is ask to switch the phone numbers of your phone and the disabled one. BOOM, new phone same unlimited data plan.

This worked for me last week and it was actually suggested to me by an employee. Just wanted to share it.

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, you have always been able to buy a phone at full price and keep your unlimited
 data. What I recently learned is a way to use your upgrade (discounted price) AND keep unlimited data. The trick is to upgrade a line on your account that is not 'in use'. If you already have one of these, all you have to do is move your upgrade (you can give your upgrade to any phone on your account) from your phone to the one not being used, upgrade it to the phone you want, then switch your number to it. What I'm not 100% sure about, is whether you can go in, disable a line on your account, do the same thing, then reactivate it.

This worked for me.  (scammer calling me constantly at work)

Tell them you need an original signed bill.  They will offer to fax you one.  Tell them you need ink on the paper and for it to be postmarked.  They will insist against this.  Tell them the only means of communication you authorize is through the mail.  They will threaten to send your 'case' to collections, to hit your credit score and all kinds of other nasties that can be taken care of ""right now!"" at a discount, but the mail takes day and by that time you will be in big trouble mister. Tell them to send the bill via snail mail, to not call you until they've done so and hang up the phone (you can do this much earlier if you like).  Send a certified and notarized cease and dessist stating that the US mail is the only authorized means of communication, if they continue calling, but they probably won't.


Telephone or e-mail scammers do not want to send you anything through the post office because it is considered mail fraud and much more easy to prosecute than telephone/fax/e-mail scams.  If you are unsure of a bill collector that calls you (you should be), ask for a signed document to be mailed.  If it's legit, they'll mail it out nearly right away.  If it's not, they probably won't.

International scams generally do not apply though."	t5_2r94o	True

The man on the other end was short with me and wanted a particular pair of Levi Action Slacks. I walk over to our Levi section, which only contains one type of jean. I inform the customer that I am sorry that we do not carry that particular pant in the store but I can see if we have it in catalog to order. He then loudly repeats himself that he wants Levi Action Slack. I say, ""Levi?"" to make sure I hear him correctly since that is the first item that I said we do not have in store. And again he yells, ""YES LEVI ACTION SLACKS!"" While trying to remain courteous, I tell the prick on the phone, ""I'm sorry sir, but we do not carry any slacks in the Levi brand."" To which he replies with, ""You're just a dumb cunt, aren't you."" And hangs up.

No sir, no I am not a dumb cunt. You are an impatient prick who does not hear what a kind service representative is trying to explain to you.

1371019716.0	1g6k1m	YSK that a new study has found a 15-minute walk after each meal could prevent older people developing type-2 diabetes	God_Wills_It_	334	82	7	"The post-meal walks control blood sugar as well as one long walk, research by George Washington University suggested.

Elevated blood sugar after meals could increase the risk of type-2 diabetes, so resting after eating ""is the worst thing you can do"", the study said.

Diabetes UK said there were ""small differences"" between exercise routines - but any activity was beneficial.

The US study was the first to test short bouts of exercise in the ""risky period"" following meals, when blood sugar can rise rapidly, lead author Loretta DiPietro said.
 
She said high blood sugar after meals was a key risk factor in the progression from impaired glucose tolerance - what the study called ""pre-diabetes"" - to type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The study found three 15-minute walks were as effective at reducing blood sugar over a 24-hour period as one 45-minute walk of the same ""easy-to-moderate"" pace.

But walking after food was ""significantly more effective"" at ""blunting the potentially damaging elevations in post-meal blood sugar commonly observed in older people"".

Older people may be ""particularly susceptible"" to poor blood sugar control after meals due to insulin resistance in the muscles and slow or low insulin secretion from the pancreas, the researchers said.

They found the best time to walk was after the evening meal, which is often the largest of the day and therefore causes the greatest rise in blood sugar.

This increase often lasted ""well into the night and early morning"", the study found, but it was ""curbed significantly"" as soon as people started to walk.

Researchers studied 10 people aged 60 and over who were at risk of developing type-2 diabetes due to higher-than-normal levels of fasting blood sugar and insufficient physical activity.

Dr DiPietro said the findings could lead to an ""inexpensive strategy"" for preventing type-2 diabetes, but said the results must be confirmed by larger trials.

Weight loss and exercise are widely accepted as key ways to prevent type-2 diabetes, which occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells do not react to insulin.

Diabetes UK estimates there are up to seven million UK people at ""high risk"" of developing type-2 diabetes.

Dr Matthew Hobbs, the charity's head of research, said the study reinforced the message that exercise was ""extremely important"" to reduce the risk.

Talking about the comparison between one 45-minute walk and three 15-minute walks after meals, he added: ""Although there were some small differences, the important take-home message is that doing any physical activity, even at a low intensity, is good for you.""
