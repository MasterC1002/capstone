Thanks guys	dtewfik	31	6	6	"I [posted a few days](http://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/18tlva/ive_been_playing_around_with_an_infographical/) ago of my infographic resume I've been working on and got some initial feedback.  I went back and edited according to (most) of your suggestions.

I know it doesn't do everything a *real* resume would do (I still plan on using one of those). But was looking for some practice, and what better set of data than my own career.  Thanks again and [check it out](http://dtewfik.com/cv)

1343155287.0	x343c	Infographics 101: What is an infographic and what is not?	SuperSumoYakuza	20	2	2	"Posting this in an effort to improve the quality of this excellent concept of a subreddit. I LOVE infographics. Almost everything that is being posted here does not fall into the infographic category.

From the wiki:
Information graphics or infographics are graphic visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics present complex information quickly and clearly, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. With an information graphic, computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians develop and communicate concepts using a single symbol to process information.

I would simplify this to say that an infographic presents a complex data set or relationship visually.

Some nice things that are not infographics:  
* brochures
* flyers
* posters
* graphic images with swaths of text laid over them
* three page long images that simply add costs (cost of batman, cost of love, etc)

Hopefully some will find this data helpful and we can see more infographics and less things that aren't."	t5_2r1ee	True

1. What is your number 1* source for infographics? (Ex. Piktochart - Hopefully the upvotes will decide)

2. How do you best distribute them? (Blog, imgur, print offs)

3. Do you ever use infographics internally at your company?

4. If you have any sources regarding the trends of inforgraphic use, I would be VERY happy! 

Cheers and thanks!
