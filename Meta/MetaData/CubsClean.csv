Kris Bryant was recently assigned here and I got the chance to go see him play tonight.  Obviously my sample size is small, and I am not a scout, but you guys are in for a treat with Kris Bryant.  He has such a sweet and compact swing.  The hawks won the game 3-1, Bryant had a 2 run home run and a sac fly accounting for all 3 RBI's.  He absolutely smoked the ball every at bat.  He looks very smooth in the field as well.  You guys probably know all of this stuff already, but I got a huge boner over him today and couldn't help but share the excitement.

I think gameday threads are awesome, but I've been disappointed with the infrequency of such threads in this subreddit. I'd love to see them gain popularity, so if there's enough interest from the rest of you, I'd be happy to take over responsibility for making sure they pop up regularly.

The funny thing is, by [some Baseball Prospectus measurements](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/), the Cubs should already be near or over .500.

* According to the [Pythagorean Expectation]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_expectation), the Cubs should be 21-22.
* According to Baseball Prospectus’s D2 projection (which uses the underlying stats of OPS+ and ERA+ and others to determine how many runs scored vs. allowed should have happened, the Cubs should be 23-20.
* And their projection which weights D2 according to strength of schedule also pegs them at 23-20.

Clearly, the Cubs have some shortcomings and things to work on. But so far, the evidence suggests that their current record is not indicative of this team’s play so far. Regression toward the mean predicts that their record will improve over the coming months. 

Note: This is not trying to sound like I'm crying in my Cheerios about bad luck. I have no problem with simple win/loss record being the all-important metric. That's the way it should be. So they've had some bad luck, that happens. The important takeaway is that the statistics suggest that things will begin turning around sooner than many people think.

Even the slightest bit?	b-had12	33	2	30	Now before you downvote, just read for a bit.  I started watching the Cubs back in preschool (1996) and have been a die-hard fan since.  And the one player who drew me in over the years, up until his departure, was Sammy Sosa. You have to understand, as a kid, I didn't care about the personality of the guy.  Heck, I wasn't even aware of any of the player's lives outside the game.  I just followed the Cubs on the field for one reason: my love of baseball.  And the way he effused happiness so many times, how excited I got watching him crush the ball and take the field...those are what made Cubs baseball great for me.  I am well aware of the steroids accusations and the corked bat incident, and that steered me away from Sosa, at which point I turned to Derrek Lee who had just arrived not too long after.  But man, Sosa was one hell of a guy to watch.  And I think without him, I may not have become as passionate about the Cubs as I am today.  I tune in to the game when I'm driving, constantly receive updates on my phone, scour the paper for stats, etc. Everything a Cubs fan can do, I do.  Maybe it's this sentimental attachment, but I can overlook Sosa's failings for one reason: he made Cubs baseball for me.  Whatever he may have done is past.  Do I think less of him for all these shortcomings? Certainly.  But I still respect all the fantastic memories he helped me create growing up in rural Illinois and suburban South Carolina.  Go Cubs go. And thank you Sammy Sosa.	t5_2qmnl	True

He went out playing the right way, trying to defend the tie despite Guerrier's best efforts to shank this game after blowing the win for Wood, and despite both teams being far out of contention.

1364824291.0	1bf6s9	A Special Season for Me	dybuell	32	4	7	"I just want to share how my love for the Cubs began and the man responsible for it.

My grandfather was the guy that got me hooked on the Cubs. He lived right across the field from where I lived, and whenever I would come over to visit during the summer, he would be sitting in his overalls in his chair, have the game on TV (but muted), the radio on, an Old Style in his hand. Even when he was working in the field on his tractor, he had a radio with him and the game on. Sometimes I would even ride with him and listen to the game.

He was a great player himself, though ironically, was drafted by the Cardinals (never played because he went to the armed forces). On game days we would sit there and he would teach me all about the game. I fell in love with the Ivy, the Scoreboard, players like Glenallen Hill, Kerry Wood, Sammy Sosa and (still my favorite to this day) Mark Grace, and especially Harry Caray singing the 7th inning stretch.

Unfortunately, he passed away earlier this month. And like many others, was not lucky enough to see his Cubs win a World Series. I know it would be asking a bit much to win one for him this year, but as is tradition, I'm going to hope.

I'll be at work during today's game, so I'll have to rely on my app to listen to the game. But next chance I get, I'm going to kick back, turn the game on (which now means finding a stream online), mute it, turn on the radio feed, and pretend I'm a kid again, listening while riding my grandpa's tractor while we work in the field on a hot summer's day.

I might even have an Old Style. 

Here's to 2013, fellow Cubs fans.

Edit - Forgot a great story about him. He and my grandmother had four boys and one girl, one of them being my dad. He would tell me stories about how when they were young, my grandpa would drive them all into Chicago (hour drive from where we all grew up), having the kids think they would go to one of the museums. All of sudden when they got into the city, he would say ""You know what, let's go to a Cubs game."" And off they went."	t5_2qmnl	True

1366382186.0	1cof3k	A bit of help from a Cubs fan in England	luke-uk	31	5	68	"Hi I first watched the Cubs play at Wrigley when I was working in the USA in the summer of 2011. It was a dull game where we lost 2-0 to the Nationals but I fell in love with the atmosphere, the passion for the team and the Cubs fans. Despite seeing the Yankees play a thriller at their spanking new stadium later that summer, I feel the Cubs are my team. Last summer I was in Thailand so it was difficult to follow them plus I was teaching myself Baseball (I thought the scores in Cricket were complicated!) but this season I've been doing my best to follow the team. However despite knowing the scores and who scored them I can't get to grips with who the players are exactly, their history and what the fans really think of them. So I was wondering if you guys could just give me a general run down of some of the key players, who they are why you think they are good/ bad ect. I'm returning to the USA this coming summer working near St Louis and am planning to see 3/4 Cubs games over there, so this will be good preparation!

Cheers

TLDR: Cubs fan from England, wants to know more about the fans opinions of the players/manager so I can follow them easier and enjoy more games when I return to the U.S this summer."	t5_2qmnl	True

I didn't go into anything beyond ERA (though I'd be willing to if there's interest here), but the results were pretty telling.

When pitching outside of the 9th (this includes pitching in extra innings), Marmol's ERA is a reasonable 4.24. Not amazing, but still serviceable in the middle innings. When pitching the 9th, Marmol's ERA more than doubles to 9.31. To me, this screams a confidence issue and/or mental block involving the 9th inning. His stuff's still good enough to be in an MLB bullpen, but the confidence is clearly lacking."	t5_2qmnl	True

1374937410.0	1j5umq	A story about my first visit to Wrigley and why I will miss Alfonso	Queefmonlee	29	7	9	"Being a younger Cub fan I did not grow up watching Banks, Santo, Sandberg, Jenkins, or any of the other greats. Year after year I got to see players traded and shipped around to other teams, so I never was able to have a ""favorite"" Cub. I was 11 when Bartman caught the ball, and that is the first Cub game I ever remember watching.

Ever since then, every year I have watched as many Cubs games as I possibly could, and for my high school graduation my Dad took me to Chicago, where he was from originally. I was so excited and we had plans to see 2 games at Wrigley field, a night game and a day game in early June against the Oakland A's. 

The first night game (a friday night I think) it poured, the game was delayed a couple of hours, but I still remember standing there in the bleachers and just taking it all in. The ivy, the scoreboard, the drunken Cubbie fans. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen. I think the Cubs ended up losing that game, but it was still incredible.

We walked around Chicago and explored all day saturday and headed back to the ballpark on Sunday afternoon. It was a great day for baseball with temps in the mid 70's. We got there pretty early and got to watch both teams take the field and warm up. And then Alfonso came out to left and started playing catch.

Just as he was about to head back to the dugout he turned around and started pointing at fans and getting us all pumped as he was going to throw a ball into the stands. I swear he looked right at me and smiled, and tossed the ball. Next thing I know I look down into my hands and there it is. I caught a ball at my second major league baseball game, and from there he was my favorite player (both because of the ball and the fact that he was basically the only Cub who stayed for more than just a few years while I grew up).

I thought I would just share my experience. I would love to hear about some of your guys first experiences at the ballpark!"	t5_2qmnl	True

I don’t understand how people can even come out against him when he seems to be the only guy with competitive fire in that club house. You can just see in the body language of the players that they don’t want to win as nearly as much as Z does. But the problems go much further than that. Jim Hendry is getting his 3rd chance to rebuild this team. You know how many GM even get a 2nd chance to rebuild? Lets shake things up a little bit.

**Garza- 11 wins, 7.77 k/9, 3.68 ERA, 3.79 FIP**

**Samardzija- 10 wins, 7.88 k/9, 3.78 ERA, 3.77 FIP**

**Baker- 9 wins, 7.34 k/9, 3.86 ERA, 3.85 FIP**

**Wood- 6 wins, 7.3 k/9, 3.90 ERA, 4.01 FIP**

**Feldman- 5 wins, 5.52 k/9, 4.19 ERA, 4.14 FIP*** 


**AVG FIP for 2012 NL Teams: 3.97**

**Washington Nations 2012 SP FIP: 3.46**

**AVG K/9 for 2012 NL Teams: 7.28**

**AVG FIP for 2012 Cubs SP: 4.36**

**Projected AVG FIP for Cubs SP: 3.912**

**James only projected 101 innings for Feldman.* 

What does this say about the Cubs? If we believe in these projections, the Cubs hopefully will have a starting five that can compete to remain above average throughout the season. It looks like a fairly large improvement to last years SP. Then again, there is a reason why this game isn't played on paper. 

Comparing the Cubs projections against a great pitching team (the Nationals), we still have work to do. Baby steps.

Go_Go_Godzilla	20	5	12	"I sympathize with the plight of fans who do not want the changes that seem to be destined to occur in Wrigley, and I sympathize further with the fans who are mad about Ricketts threat (although, to be fair, all teams do this when negotiating for new stadiums/renovations/public funs or support) to move to the team.

But, here to put things in perspective is the list of privately funded stadiums in baseball history:

Fenway Park – 1912

Wrigley Field – 1914

Dodger Stadium – 1960

AT&amp;T Ballpark – 2000

Now, just let that sink in. No one in baseball besides the Giants (park cost 357 million and is beautiful, but has a ton of advertisements) in the last 5 decades has privately funded their park. No one. The Cubs are, in effect, doing that through the 300 million dollar ""renovation"" to the park. I wanted to put that out there as a lot of current criticism of the scoreboard and advertisements is backed by Forbers saying the Cubs are the most profitable team in baseball. Yes, this is true, but it is also quite a lot to ask for the most profitable team in baseball to pay 300 million without cutting payroll.

Each opinion is fine, I sympathize with all. But I found this striking that what the Cubs are attempting to do is very, very rare and to do it without increasing revenues at all seems like a very, very big request to make."	t5_2qmnl	True

Reliving the collapse that happened in Game 6 of the NLCS was torture, but worse than that was watching what happened to Steve Bartman. I remember at the time watching it at home, I was so infuriated and settled on him as the scapegoat just like the media wanted. However, last night watching the replay and subsequent events afterwards over and over again I couldn't feel worse for the guy. I didn't even remember Alex Gonzalez's error on a taylor made double play that would of ended the inning. All I remembered was FOX showing the replay over and over again. Bartman was a true cubs fan (only a true fan would listen to the game while at the field) that we blamed for our teams mistakes on the field. I hope that no one ever has to go through what we put him through in the days and months after this event. 	t5_2qmnl	True

Heck, we are better than the Padres, Twins, and Pirates, but can't put a record together to save our lives.   #ShamelessSelfRant, I apologize in advance, I just had to get it out...	t5_2qmnl	True
1338769585.0	ujcfc	Will the Cubs trade Lahair?	cubsfan66	14	3	23	The answer is yes, if the price is high enough.  I believe they want to get two prospects for him.  He cannot, at this stage in his career, learn to hit left handed pitching. The cubs won't start him against lefties so he can't regularly play any position. The cubs want keep his average above 300 so they can trade him.  Don't get me wrong, I like Lahair and acknowledge that he will continue to succeed against right handers-who are 80% of the population and at least 60% of ball players.  He would be great to have around for the next couple years but if Theo snaps up a couple good prospects for him, I won't be surprised or unhappy. He is 29, after all.	t5_2qmnl	True

I want to give a pair of tickets to a friend and his wife who just moved to Chicago from Los Angeles for one of the Cubs-Dodgers games at Wrigley at the start of August.

What is the best way for me to do this?

Is it best to call the Cubs, buy the tickets over the phone, and leave them at the will-call window under his name?

I'd prefer to have the Cubs mail him the tickets so he has them in advance without having to schlep to will-call on the day of the game. Do the Cubs do this for third-party purchasers like me?

My real preference is to send him a gift certificate type of thing that allows him to call the Cubs, pick which of the four games he wants to see and his seating choice, and then the Cubs tell me his choices and I pay the amount. But I don't know how exactly I can do that.

1338229090.0	u90ge	Do you think the Cubs should refresh their Jerseys for Wrigley Field's 100 year anniversary?	Awesomeade	12	2	4	"So, I've been thinking a lot about various aspects of the Cubs' branding lately, as thinking about their play is too painful. While I like their current uniforms, I don't really think they quite capture the history that surrounds the Cubs and Wrigley Field. For a while now, I've wanted them to consider going back to more classic look along [these](http://i.imgur.com/dbl3b.png) lines.

I think that the 100 year anniversary of Wrigley Field would be the perfect opportunity for the Cubs to undergo such a rebranding, both to celebrate the Cubs' heritage and history, and because 2014 could very well be the year in which we find ourselves back in contention. A new look would be the perfect way to celebrate the ushering in of a new era of Cubs success.

Personally I feel this kid has all the necessary tools to be a super star. My question to you all is simply do you feel this is the type of kid our dear Cubbies will keep around and build upon or is he the type of player Jed and Theo may try to trade for prospects to keep building up for the future. I think he has all the right stuff to be one of the kids, Castro, Barney, Rizzo, and Jackson as well, the Cubs can build a championship team in the very near future. If you think the Cubs should keep LaHair, which honestly seems to be a really popular opinion, where exactly does he fit in the overall grand scheme position wise? Is he a corner infielder or an outfielder? I think he's done a pretty stellar job at first, but Rizzo has almost an automatic claim to it when he does get called up, something I could see happening soon, I personally can't see where to put him when this does happen.

Also I'm sorry if there is a thread like this out there. I just don't have many Cubby fans where I live, hell not many Chicago fans period, so I can't really talk with anybody about my random musings about what I believe to be a very bright future for the Cubs.

Quick Edit... Yes I am quite aware and have been of how old LaHair actually is. I have known he is older; I refer to him as a kid because he is a part of the VERY young group of kids I believe to be a part of the future. Not to mention he hasn't had much in the way of major league experience.

I would contest that the Cubs have no clear ""best"" pitcher in their bullpen, and as a result, it doesn't really make sense to choose a single person to fill the roll.

So... Why not just play the matchups until the game is over? In any situation, whichever pitcher has the highest likelihood of getting a batter out is the pitcher you want on the mound. In the absence of a lights-out stud, the best option is to put your mediocre pitchers in a position to succeed.

I love sitting in the bleachers when I go to games, but I hadn't been to a game in years and usually when I went we would sit in right field, so I never got a feel for Soriano. But this year, I was able to sit out in left field to get a real feel for Alfonso. I sat down thinking that I was going to hate him the entire game, but he really surprised me. He interacted with the fans extremely well and he seemed to really care about the game.

I also had a chance to get a ball signed by him at the Cubs convention and had a quick word with him. He seemed like a really nice guy and even in person seemed to really care about the fans. If there was any possible way to get drinks with this guy sometime, I totally would. I feel like he would be a good time.

Ever since the Dempster fiasco, though, it seems like the Cubs are too gun-shy to pull the trigger on anything. At the beginning of this month, I was content with (even ecstatic in some cases - Soriano, I'm looking at you!) the idea that at least two-thirds of these players were going to be moved:

Dempster
Garza
Marmol
Soto
Soriano
Barney
DeJesus
LaHair
Maholm

MSUmath2013	12	1	10	"Hopefully these posts aren't annoying on your subreddit, but I figured I would get the best information directly from the fans. Have the pleasure of seeing the Tigers in Wrigley next Wednesday and I'm very excited. I have a few of questions though, hopefully you can help:

1. Parking- I will not be staying overnight in Chicago (I'm a broke college student, I wish) and will be commuting from MI, where is a good spot to park, and how much would I expect to pay? Preferrably close to Wrigleyville, like within a mile.

2. Resale of tickets- I bought 4 bleacher tickets to the game and don't have nearly enough diehard friends to go with (I legitimately might be alone). I will probably put these tickets up for sale on stubhub, but if they don't sell on stubhub, is scalping legal in Chicago? I am really just looking to resell for what I paid for them (not above face value) and if it is legal where should I do this? Any tips? It's generally not frowned upon in Detroit as long at you are 500 yds from the stadium. I am just looking to get rid of unused tickets and not spend the night in a Chicago jail. Also would sitting alone in general admission be an issue? I'm by no means a loud fan, but I will be in Detroit gear. Would rather not get my ass kicked. 

Thanks for any help. I look forward to the trip."	t5_2qmnl	True

I consider myself fairly baseball savvy and as such, I am up to date on most events as they happen and consider myself well versed in all of the teams. My problem is that my family has a lineage of Cubs fans. I was one for some time and I faded away towards another team, which will remain nameless for the time being. I find myself, however, becoming more and more disheartened with the prospect of carrying on with this team. It isn't because said team isn't projected to do well either, it's just...something is missing. The togetherness that I felt as a Cubs fan for all those years has been missing. That, along with the longing to feel a home environment, I live in Northern Illinois, is what has brought me here tonight. 

I want to hear your stories. Your times of weakness in the Cubs. The trying years recently and in the past that have maybe made you wander to other teams, and how you have gotten over it and come back to the Blue and Red. 

I apologize if this was too long but I figured this would be the best place to express my concerns, and proclaim my eternal love for the Cubs. It is unfortunate that it took me this long to discover what it truly mean to be a Cubs fan.

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback. This is what I hoped to get when I started this."	t5_2qmnl	True

- I am tired to death of the fact that the Cubs receive more national coverage for his antics than anything else
- I refuse to buy his half-assed ""remorse"" that really only came through his agent
- His $18M salary... this year stands as an ongoing reminder of the handful of washed up/overrated Cubs that make a sub-.500 team out of one of the highest payrolls in the sport
- I don't like the fact that he has a better relationship with the manager of the White Sox than he has with any Cubs manager he has pitched under
- For the amount of money he makes, and the faith the fans have placed in him, he could at the very least go into the clubhouse before he has a meltdown. He could shut his mouth when he's upset, and air his grievances to Riggins/Quade/Hendry/Ricke​tts instead of the media

Our eternally loyal fanbase has shown him support for his entire career here, and he has repaid us by punching out our catcher, destroying a cooler with a piece of wood, calling out a relief pitcher on national television, picking a fight with Derrek Lee (didn't even know that was possible) and yes, smacking a few home runs and pitching a couple of serious gems.

We don't have tickets, figured we'd buy them outside the stadium. Any problems going that route on game day? Best place to sit? Probably looking at spending $30-70 bucks a ticket.

1345612606.0	ymg8h	/r/cubs to allow for input from more than just Cubs fans?	amadea56	13	5	19	Recently, /r/dodgers allowed their flair to represent more than just Dodgers fans, for all teams in the MLB so all perspectives can be represented.  They took this out of the /r/sfgiants book.  Now there can be banter back and forth between the fanbases of both teams as well as fans from other teams.  The comments tend to be more playful, funny, and insightful instead of hateful and spiteful.  I think /r/cubs should allow for flair from all teams in the MLB.  Your thoughts Chicago?	t5_2qmnl	True

1341179357.0	vw7yc	Best time to plan first Cubs game?	lollerskittles	9	0	20	"I got my hands on some flight vouchers, and am orchestrating a visit to Chicago (from middle-of-nowhere Texas) for my wonderful boyfriend, who just so happens to be a die hard Cubs fan. He's made it to spring training or at least one Cubbies game every year, but has never been to Wrigley Field, or Chicago for that matter. I love Chicago, but didn't grow up a Cubs fan and don't know a lot about the MLB in general. Still, I want to take a load off his shoulders and do most of the planning so he can just relax and enjoy fulfilling a childhood dream.

I've read other threads about things to do around the stadium, and just have a few specific questions (though all advice is welcome!):

1. When is the best time to go? We were thinking of taking a long weekend in August/September. Is there a day of the week that's best to go? I think both of us would like to see a win, but it's more important to us to see a good game...is there a particular team that would be good to watch them play against?

2. What time is best to get there? We'll take the Red Line up, and I'm sure take some time to check out the statues and outside of the stadium before going in. He would seriously lose his mind if we had a chance to get on the field. How can I make that happen?

3. I've heard you can bring food &amp; drink in. True/False?

4. What's our best bet for getting cheap tickets? What sections should I be looking to sit in for a good experience (I would love to only pay maybe $40 or less per ticket, but I don't want shitty seats for his first game).

Any other advice is of course appreciated. Thank you guys for any help you can possibly give, and go Cubbies :)"	t5_2qmnl	True

I gotta be honest, it looks good on paper. Fergie Jenkins is:

* One of the first great African American baseball players, a member of the ""14 Black Aces""
* A man with a voice that would make a wolverine purr, truly delightful to listen to
