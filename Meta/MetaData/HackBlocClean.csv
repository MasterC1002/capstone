1300376574.0	g5vru	I believe Adrian Lamo, ex-hacker who turned in Bradley Manning, has been brainwashed. Details and evidence on speculation inside.	learnmore	66	12	23	"My theory is they brainwashed this kid, manchurian candidate style, MKUltra, or whatever.

Before May 2010 he had the exact opposite opinion about hacking. In less than a year he's undergone a complete change in opinion, mannerisms, vocal cadence, and appearance. He's hardly recognizable compared to who he once was. This young man has had his spirit and soul drained from him.

Watch this and pay close attention to his mannerisms. This is him pre-May 2010 in unreleased footage for a documentary about hackers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsyjQh03Xs&amp;t=5m54s

More interviews and documentary footage of Lamo from before his April run in with the police. Lamo in the Hackers Wanted documentary. He speaks eloquently and never loses focus of the subject matter. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTYyltYi80

Here he is again in a Tech TV interview from 2003: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_SwtWu2HXk

Now he struggles to articulate himself, stammers, blinks heavily, completely monotone, and has a scar above his left ear.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsSRaoOo2k

I think this is when they had something done to him, from a Wired magazine article:

""In May 2010 Lamo reported his backpack stolen. The investigating officer noted unusual behavior by Lamo and detained him. He was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome after having been placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold, which was extended to a total of nine days.""

There are now reports that Bradley Manning also appears to be catatonic and having severe problems communicating. If they're doing this to Lamo what is keeping them from doing this to Bradley Manning? I'm thoroughly creeped out by all this.

**Below are more links to articles and video interviews about Lamo**

Interesting article picking up on this in November. http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-and-the-convenient-memories-of-adrian-lamo/

Lamo has worked for FBI or NSA, [german news source](http://www.faz.net/s/Rub475F682E3FC24868A8A5276D4FB916D7/Doc~EB7743084C84B417480B1175808764D35~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html) google chrome translate for the win. 

&gt; After that Lamo is a security specialist that the secret ""Project Vigilant"" worked for ( https: / / www.projectvigilant.us/ ). This project was Mark Rasch with donations from the business founded by. Quickly headed for nine years, the Internet Crime Unit of the U.S. Department of Justice and took for his project top people on board, including Ira Winkler, the NSA (National Security Agency) for FISA activities (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) is responsible was observed and foreign intelligence agencies.

Some more footage on Lamo. I don't have time to go through it now, but it's here if anyone is interested. The wikipedia page on Lamo is growing.

Forgott3n	38	5	5	"DemocracyNow! and a few other sources (Reddit included) are speaking about Mohammed Nabbous after he was shot and killed by a sniper. When I was watching DemocracyNow!, they showed an earlier interview in which he told them how he was able to broadcast to the world... By essentially becoming his only lone ISP and using a satellite to connect to the Internet.

My question is essentially: How do you connect to the Internet when your whole country is disconnected? This would be a smart resource to have on hand if something ever went down (It's not like you can Google how to do it if you're already shutdown!).

**[EDIT]**

After spending some time on the Googles, Wikipedias, EFFs, and YouTubes it looks like access to the Internet from Egypt, Syria, and Libya  has been a hodgepodge of connection services offered by such fantastic groups like Telecomix and French Data Network. Essentially they ""devolved"" by using dial-up lines, HAM radio, etc. etc.

Tor has a few problems. The end server doesn't know who the client is, but the client knows who the server is. We need a way to prevent both uploaders and downloaders from finding out who each others identity. This is the tricky part. The Tor network uses supernodes that know about all the other nodes and are responsible for making paths. That's no good, we can't be that centralized.


I've been researching how freenet works but I don't think a distributed hash is the answer. I'd like to keep the peer/seed dynamic of torrenting where one user has the file and other users download the file from that person; except instead of downloading directly from the user, the file travels through some other nodes first.


Here's what I'm thinking now. I have a file. I yell out that I have access to the file and person A hears me. Person A yells out that he has access to the file and person B hears him. Person B yells out that he has access to the file and Person C hears him. C asks B for the file. B asks A for the file. A asks me for the file. I give the file to A who gives it to B who gives it C.


I'm the uploader. B and C don't even know I exist. A doesn't know if I'm the uploader or just another link in the chain. Likewise, I don't even know that C exists. I know A is connected to me, but is he downloading pirated software (-gasp-) or just passing packets along? ISPs don't get sued for routing packets. Our nodes won't actually yell out the file that they have access to, they'll yell out a checksum. Unless our intermediary nodes look up the checksum, they never know what file the packets are from and can claim innocence. The people who want access to the file will download the checksum off a message board, much like torrent files are downloaded today.


What would be ideal is if the intermediary nodes had no idea what they passing along and had no way to look it up. In this system we've just developed, even if the nodes have no idea what the file is, they still know that it's the same file. How about salting the checksum with the UTC time and updating every 20min? I post the original checksum on a message board (lets call it ""abc""). I then tell Person A I have a file called md5(abc+16:30). The nodes routing the data have no clue what the file is or even if they're still routing the same file. The downloaders know the original checksum, so they can easily update every 20min. Of course, this protection disappears if the  intermediary has access to the original checksum.

After seeing egokick's awesome [hack bloc design](http://www.reddit.com/r/HackBloc/comments/10nxvq/hack_bloc/) I was inspired to create the following:

[Hack Bloc Sticker](http://imgur.com/aotnj)

I changed it a bit from the original design to better assist my purposes, and then I had a bunch of stickers printed by the coop printer [RevoltLab](http://revoltlab.com).

While I'm planning to hand out a number of them I thought I would share some with you all. If you would like one I would be happy to send you one, or if you are using them for organizing I could send you a few. Of course you will have to share with me a mailing address through PM. If anyone has a suggestion for sending them out that doesn't require me to know your address let me know. I can always send you the image files I used to create the image so that you can print it yourself if preferred.

I know sporting a Hack Bloc sticker on your gear might draw unwanted attention for some of you, but others may benefit from them. So, I thought I'd share. 

**EDIT**

Here is a zip with a png, pdf, and xcf files for printing the image: http://www.filedropper.com/hackblocsticker

Essentially, they're calling for a renewal of free/open wifi hotspots, manned by the citizenry.

They don't go into any details as to how this should happen, but looking at my spare parts laying around, it seems like it would be pretty easy to:

- setup a wide-open wifi router  
- plug the router into one of the NICs on my linux box  
- run tor on that box  
- configure iptables to traffic shape and route all traffic from that router that can go over tor into it, and drop the rest  

This seems like it would fulfill a number of desirable properties, including:

- providing free wifi to the commons.  
- controlling how much bandwidth is consumed by free wifi users.  
- limiting my liability.  

There are a few things that this is not doing, like:

- preventing free wifi users from playing stupid ARP tricks and sniffing on each others.  
- guaranteeing to free wifi users that I'm not sniffing the hell out of their traffic.  


So that's where I'm at. What do you guys think? Anything I'm missing, or that could be done better?

Also, apparently, dd-wrt has a tor package, so I could possibly setup everything on one router, and just plug that into my network. That also opens the possibility of distributing ready-to-use open wifi appliances. So that'd be neat, potentially.

*edit: So this idea isn't quite as novel as previously thought. There's a few months old project called [Torouter](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/Torouter) that aims to do mostly the same thing."	t5_2rwwm	True

Im from LABIA(Ladies and Bitcoin in Arms!). We are a sex positive group of women with aims of educating our community about bitcoin.  Im sure you have heard of Bitcoin, it is the opensource p2p crypto currency. It is revolutionary in a lot of ways, perhaps the most pertinent to us is the fact that anyone connected to the internet can use it, and you dont have to sign up for anything (pseudonymous). This opens up a world of options for anonymous-micro-payments, and if you can use reddit, you can definitely use this.

So you maybe wondering what do sexPositive women have to do with bitcoin micro-payments? 

enter: **leChateau deCrypto** (/r/decrypto)

A venue for people interested in receiving bitcoins for their gonewild action. Patrons and admirers can digitally tip their favourite photos, or even ""purchase"" special requests/personalized pictures. Our aim is to spur bitcoin economic growth within the reddit culture. We invite our users to post like they would in any other subreddit, and we ask that they include their bitcoin address in their verification images, then redditors can send bitcoins or parts of bitcoins(0.001) to other redditors to encourage photos or albums that they liked. These little tips add up, so tippers can tip with their tips.. and everything(woahdude).

Hopefully it wont stop here, I regularly see insightful comments that I would tip, that is to say our goal is not limited to people getting naked. We just feel that naked people is where wed like to place our roots.. I mean its just so easy to take off all your clothes.. amirite?

Also, we will happily provide linkbacks for any subreddits interested. Please pass this message on if you think its interesting... and write back if you have any questions! Any insight is much appreciated and we welcome debate and consensus in how such a community should be run.

1346205295.0	yzvvw	Seamless integration of illegal (copyrighted) content on a legal site?	gnos1s	16	5	7	"It's very useful to have a site on the regular web (non-darknet) -- you get a much larger number of users. However, this means you are subject to copyright laws and take-down requests. Not complying them will obviously result in the site being taken down.

What I am picturing is a Wiki that is resistant to take-downs by having all content automatically mirrored on darknet sites controlled by different entities. Content could be reachable from the site either by the human-readable URL like /dir/somedir/file.html, but would also be reachable with a url like /hash/sha256:b436af6feaec913ced27ed8ca9a40eb7fa520c77345191411a9ed72c473131ff.  When accessed with the human-readable URL, the hash URL would be appended to the actual (human-readable) URL preceded by a ""#"" character using JavaScript or perhaps a HTTP redirect.

When the site receives a take-down request, they remove it from the clear website, but the hash will still be in links and in people's browsing histories, so the content can be readily accessed with the hash URL, which retrieves it automatically from the darknet sites.  The take-down request would not be meaningful for the hash URLs since there is no storage of content on the clear site. It just acts as a proxy for the darknet sites.

Now, would this site be legally in the clear?"	t5_2rwwm	True

Note that it's not meant for end users yet. You can compile it just fine (make sure you have the dev version of protobuf-c on your box. most distros have packages for it), and setup a tunnel with it (you might have to setup [/dev/net/tun](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt) ), but after that, you still won't have anybody to play with.

So that's the good news. On the downside, the project seems like it will need more active contributors to become a viable darknet.

I've never had my own server, nor do I know anything about setting one up, much less what services to pay for, or how to go about that, or... honestly I feel like there's this big giant gap in my knowledge when it comes to ""servers"", but no idea what that gap is or where to start filling it. For all my knowledge in the absence of hands-on experience the word ""server"" still has almost a mythical aura of strangeness. It's really frustrating because my google-fu for once is utterly failing me, it's like I have advanced knowledge in a lot of areas but feel like I'm missing really basic things, and I've no idea where to start looking or what to start fiddling with. It's all either trivial, known to me like basic PHP, SQL stuff, or an incomprehensible cliff face.

Say I want to get a remote server and put stuff on it. Access via that there SSH, whatever, and... host a site? I get that you can buy space on server farms and then it's like you have your own little VM that you can log into. Everyone apparently does that. But uh, how on earth do I do that? How do I set up an account? Who should I set one up with? There's some Amazon thing, right? And then to get a site up I do what with what to get a dynamic ip with my isp?  Ehhh... I'm totally missing the terminology to describe the terminology that I could be missing, so my search queries on google are useless. Is there an intro to setting up one's first cheap remote server thingymaroo to play around with? Is there even a continuous stepladder of guides through various levels of knowledge out there? Any other intro guides, resources, etc, personal experience or settings or choices folks could pass on?

From DDoS attacks on Mastercard etc., to Tunisia and Egypt....but do you think it has any effect apart from shortlived publicity?

I am giving a presentation on Hacktivism and am seeking opinions of those involved as to whether they think there is any long-term/actual gain from hacking, or is it just for PR?

I am also wondering whether people involved think there is a central focus/moral code followed by hacktivists, or are they, as often described by mainstream media, as a few thousand disparate male teenagers looking for something to do on the internet?

One thing that I'd like to try out is to use a DNS-Server which isnt more or less controlled by my ISP/Government. (as far as my basic knowledge goes, if politicians want to block stuff and shits not gotten totally real, they're talking about dns-blocking?). 

Is it safe or lets say ""anonymous"" to use googles dns-server? I know that ""anonymous"" is a word often used and more often misunderstood, but...would I ""risk"" anything (dns-requests logged and saved including my ip, data being sold to marketing-people, cooperation with governments and stuff)? Are there more trustworthy public dns-servers?

And another question: I read some tutorials and articles about using proxys. I think I understand how to use them, why to use them, but I don't know how to learn which proxys to use/trust. Should they be in a country which isnt best friends with my own? Doesnt matter? Maybe you have some links to interesting reads where I can learn more about that topic?

( . Y . )

I'm sure we agree that as of 2012 ""the system"" (of corporate plutocracy) doesn't work very well. It works worse for some than others (e.g. Foxconn employees.) But I think calling it a ""free market"" is a misnomer.

First off, I define a ""market"" as ""a bunch of people trading goods, services, and information among themselves.""

Further, I define a ""free"" market as one where the prices of the stuff being traded are set by market forces (like supply and demand). Additionally the costs of using the market, like cost of entry and transaction costs, are themselves determined by the market. [1] (So, basically, no external actors are interfering with the market.)

Here are a few examples of how external actors actually distort the world's markets as of 02.22.12. [2] These distortions tend to benefit someone, to the detriment of someone else.

* States create barriers to entry by forcing corps to pay registration fees and file paperwork (see, ""[Accredited Investors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor)"")
* States impose a cost on using the market through periodic licensing and regulatory fees and paperwork 
* States attempt to impose a cost on all transactions through taxes, and usually succeed
* States sets minimum wages (setting a price control on the price of labor)
* Central banks set interest rates (setting a price control on the price of ""borrowing money"")
* Central banks and governments print more money, inflating the supply of their currencies, making these currencies less valuable over time - which adds a cost to simply ""owning money""
* People who would like to participate in the market can be [forced to exit](http://tradehillblog.com/2012/02/13/tradehill-suspending-trading-and-returning-client-funds/) through threats of litigation, as long as someone else has enough money to abuse the legal system

In my hypothetical free market, govts+corps can no longer interfere effectively. Transaction costs are determined by the market. The cost of near-perfect information is determined by the market. Entry and exit costs are determined by the market. And in any market worth its salt (heh heh), these costs will be low.

**Cryptoanarchy** means, we exploit cryptography to build such a free market. 

Imagine if the world's workers all download a linux live CD that, when run, connects us into a global digital agora. Crypto-based pseudonyms let us build networks of people who can trust each others' identities online without ever meeting face to face or giving up their anonymity. [Digital cash](http://reddit.com/r/bitcoin) gives us financial privacy, decreases transaction costs and minimizes barriers to entry. Using a [distributed internet](http://reddit.com/r/darknetplan) limits the risks of centralized information control.

Instantly, there is more competition in every field as people realize they can make money without having to deal with the inefficiencies of the state-sanctioned system. 

People digitally sign private contracts. Arbitration companies compete with the official legal system. Few people bother to file business registrations or taxes, because the government can only chase down and punish a small percentage of violators, and others are selling insurance covering those risks anyway. Everyone is part of [System D](http://www.wired.com/magazine/tag/system-d/), on a global, online scale.

Eventually some hackers reverse engineer the iPhone and release open source plans for the OurPhone Ultimate. The hackers+makers of the world smell a profit opportunity and compete to manufacture and trade the various components that make up OurPhones. Others start corps that assemble components, selling OurPhones wholesale to retail corps. 

Given a free market and enough time, eventually the OurPhone will compete directly with the iPhone since Apple (and  Apple's entire supply chain) will have to beat the competition in the free market. Apple, granted, will start with a lot of inertia because it's an economy of scale.

So now there's more jobs and more perfect market information. Workers can compare the wages offered by Foxconn with the wages offered by WoW powerlevelling contracts, and make rational decisions about where to work (i.e. how to best allocate their labor.) The existence of $1/hour jobs shows that 2012's state-sanctioned market is not very good at allocating labor resources on a global scale.

The big benefit of market anarchy is that everyone participating gets to keep all of the value they generate. I don't know what percentage of the 99%'s income goes to the 1% through taxes, credit card interest, and inflation but it seems like a hell of a lot.

Cheers
:-PLATO

[1] Interestingly, the wikipedia article on [perfect markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_market) says:

&gt; Note that the conditions for Perfect Competition mean that a perfect market cannot be unregulated, since these preconditions for market function cannot at the same time be products of the market, yet must be provided somehow.

I think this is mistaken. Nothing stops hackers from forking someone's market and improving it to more closely approximate a perfect market. As long as traders have enough information to know what markets exist, they can choose to use the market that they like best. Yo dawg I heard you like markets...

[2] Some of these only apply to the official, state-sanctioned markets - drug dealers generally don't pay taxes on their income. "	t5_2rwwm	True

1294602148.0	ez34u	Is there only space for one large scale decntralised digital currency?	IAmAngry	5	0	6	"This has just been bouncing around my head for the last few months. Thought it would be better in /r/hackbloc than /r/bitcoin...

Does the nature of distributed currency mean it's easier to enforce a monopoly of currency? 


People have for a long time talked specifically about bitcoin and if it ever rivalled actual currencies governments could dump huge numbers of nodes to disrupt and poison the swarm.

But this issue rears its head with competition realistically between digital-currencies. 

Many parties act to manipulate traditional currencies through markets and government policy to protect their reserves. In p2p digital-currencies larger swarms can directly poison smaller competing currency swarms relatively easy with their size. (For example the ability built into the software (e.g. a branch of bitcoin wallet), with no huge impact on the user)

The traditional currency manipulation normally has a papertrail with laws, p2p swarm overwhelming does not. The smaller swams can enforce controls and trusted nodes while they grow, but then it's only p2p ""once we've outgrown the attackers""


So really I'm looking for thoughts on this matter :

Can a large digital currency enforce its monopoly, for example bitcoin in a niche of anonymous website services, and users protect their reserves through unaccountable sabotage of upcoming digital currencies by members of the larger swarm?

Is there only space for one large decentralised currency while all those that come after must have a central authority to protect from it, until they're big enough to take over the top-dog position?"	t5_2rwwm	True

Facebook has apparently been unhelpful. I thought I'd pass along this situation to you all, since I feel quite strongly for these women.

So my question is, what can my friend do to track this guy down? As you might imagine, law enforcement there has not been helpful.

A simple forum or message board type thing would be good. I'd like the directory to be passcode protected, and if possible to also only accept connections over SSL. The contents of this directory should not be cached by search engines (I'm assuming making the directory passcode protected would do this, but I'm not sure) and not readable by anything that does not have the passcode. I think that's about it. My question is, what would be the best way to accomplish this? I'm looking for message board suggestions, security advice, etc. Thanks!	t5_2rwwm	True

1358961813.0	174qsb	Looking for writers interested in the challenges facing online security &amp; decentralization today		3	2	0	"Hi! My name is Jake and I head up a site called The CitizenWeb Project. This project is a mission to fight for a free, open, and above all a decentralized Internet. In order to achieve this, it aims to empower everyday internet users with the information and resources they need to take matters into their own hands. We seek to spread the word about how to secure yourself online and how to declare ""digital independence"" in this age of the Google hivemind and Facebook privacy nightmares. While these services may be convenient, they carry very dangerous implications for our freedoms. This is only getting worse with time, as the corporations behind these services become entangled and indiscernable from government services and real-life social obligation. And it is only getting worse for the most sensitive users: journalists, activists, muckrakers and whistleblowers.

There are viable alternatives to these invasive and ubiquitous services. The CitizenWeb Project is therefore focused on giving the tools to each individual user to become an independent ""citizen"" of the Web -- to decentralize their social networks and platforms, to become the TRUE owners of their data, and to communicate and network in security.

We have several software projects in the works, as well as a full-featured news and information website that also hosts HOWTOs designed to spread awareness about free/decentralized software alternatives. This includes not only the more popular apps like Tor and PGP, but also new and up-and-coming projects that don't get much press or attention elsewhere. We are looking for: writers, hacks, hackers, tech news junkies, anyone who would be interested in contributing content for the site to help advance its mission. There are three categories of contributors presently, **for more information, check out [the Contributions notice](http://files.citizenweb.is/contrib.html)**. These contributions are volunteer at this point, but depending on the site's popularity we might be able to switch to a user-supported model for content in the future. If you are an aspiring tech/hacker journo, this would be a great opportunity for you to get your work out there and do something you love in the process!

Our site launches on January 31st and we are very excited to share it with the world. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2rwwm	True
