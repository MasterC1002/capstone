Apparently the grant money he receives a lot of the time is conditional that he buys titles by Australian authors, which precludes many foreign authors from the library and would explain why he's never heard of TP. 

I pointed him to the Nomes trilogy and the Wee Free Men (Tiffany Aching) series and lent him Moving Pictures to read for himself. He sounded very positive about it, and I've achieved one or both of two things: either he will become a TP devotee himself, or he will introduce some of the kids at the school to the genius of TP.

""It's a popular fact that 90% of the brain is not used and, like most popular facts, it is wrong. Not even the most stupid Creator would go to the trouble of making the human head carry around several pounds of unnecessary grey goo if its only real purpose was, eg, to serve as a delicacy for certain remote tribesmen in unexplored valleys, it is used. One of its functions is to make the miraculous seem ordinary, and turn the unusual into the usual. Otherwise, human beings, forced with the daily wondrousness of everything, would go around wearing a stupid grin, saying ""WOW"" a lot. Part of the brain exists to stop this happening. It is very efficient, and can make people experience boredom in the middle of marvels""  –– Sir Terry Pratchett, *Small Gods*

Then a few days ago I saw this on /r/cogsci:

HEADLINE: [**""Magic Mushrooms"" Expand the Mind By Dampening Brain Activity**](http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/24/magic-mushrooms-expand-the-mind-by-dampening-brain-activity/)

&gt;Huxley posited that ordinary consciousness represents only a fraction of what the mind can take in. In order to keep us focused on survival, Huxley claimed, the brain must act as a “reducing valve” on the flood of potentially overwhelming sights, sounds and sensations. What remains, Huxley wrote, is a “measly trickle of the kind of consciousness” necessary to “help us to stay alive.”

&gt;A new [brain imaging] [study](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1119598109) by British researchers supports this theory.

&gt;…“The results seem to imply that a lot of brain activity is actually dedicated to keeping the world very stable and ordinary and familiar and unsurprising,” says Robin Carhart-Harris, a postdoctoral student at Imperial College London and lead author of the study published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*.

Subject: Question for Mr. Pratchett
To: CPSmythe@aol.com
Date: Sat, 1 Apr 2006 08:30:36 -0600

I know you probably get a ton of e-mails, so I will keep this brief. I 
am a huge fan, read all of his books several times, etc. and I have 
noticed a recurring theme. In every single one of his books where rank, be it military or otherwise, is mentioned, Mr. Pratchett seems to have a fixation on Seargents. Well, perhaps not a fixation, but a sincere respect or admiration. I was just wondering why.

His reply:
 
Joshua,
 
Sergeants are useful, that's why. They tend to run things on the ground, they have quite a lot of power (if they are clever) they're in the front line of what's going on, and have to maintain a relationship with the men below and the officers above. The have to master a lot of skills. For an author, that means 'useful'.

She decided to take a pick at some Discworld characters, and I thought it might be interesting to share with the results with r/Discworld.

Here is the list, with some points relevant to each characters:

- [Granny Weatherwax](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Granny%20Weatherwax/meme_0001.jpg):
  With her infamous broom, an owl, bees and a spider, and the sign **I aten't dead**. Given her habits on dolls outfit, Granny one is pretty plain, and she tried to capture the strictness of the character.
- [Nanny Ogg](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Nanny%20Ogg/nounou_0001.jpg): Joyful with her single tooth, reinforced hat, and red boots. Greebo's there too, and there is a hedgehog on her broom, because you know... the [song](http://www.lspace.org/fandom/songs/hedgehogsong.html)
- [Magrat Garlick](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Magrat%20Garlick/magrat_0001.jpg): She is known to have some quite messy hair, like reading, have fancier style that her elders and obviously, she tends to leave pumpkins in her trail.
- [Tiffany Aching](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Tiffany%20Aching/tiphaine_0001.jpg): Even if things evolve along the way, she is represented without hat, her frying pan, followed around by a sheep and 3 Nac Mac Feegles.
- [Susan Sto Helit](http://cam-crea.com/en/creations/Dolls/FanArt/Susan%20Sto%20Helit/): Her white hair with a touch of black, her bun, her **style**. Along herself, there is a black tree with a crow, an hourglass, and she is carrying a scythe.

Work has been completed on The Long War (the sequel to The Long
Earth) and as reported later in this issue will be released in June.

The Long War - the second book in The Long Earth series will be
released on 20 June 2013. And is available to pre-order from Amazon
now.

Terry and Rob have locked themselves away and have been working
extensively on the next full adult Discworld novel - they are making
good progress and the words are really steaming along. I can also
confirm that this novel will NOT be Raising Taxes.

Some of the newspapers have reported that Rhianna Pratchett will
take over writing Discworld novels after Terry stops.  Rhianna and
Terry actually meant that Rhianna is well placed to concentrate on
co-writing the adaptations for Narrativia and working on spin off
works because of her in depth knowledge of Discworld.  Rhianna has
no plans to write Discworld novels as she feels Discworld these
should remain her father's legacy.

The Discworld App comes a step closer.  A screenshot of the App was
recently pasted on the Terry Pratchett Facebook page.  The App will
initially be released for the iPad only and there are currently no
immediate plans to support other platforms

http://discworldmonthly.co.uk/url/APP190A

Late breaking news (5th February) I now have it on good authority
that the App will be available to purchase and download from Monday

1354782138.0	14diwa	The next generation of Discworld leaders (may be kind of spoilery)	turnerjer	74	5	67	"It seems like Terry has been grooming some characters to take over power on the Discworld when the old guard of leaders (Vetinari, Vimes, Granny, maybe even Lady Margolotta) retire.  I wonder what folks think of these notions.  (I've heard some of these ideas on this sub, so credit where it's due.)

It seems plausible that Vetinari intends to someday hand leadership of Ankh Morpork over to Moist Von Lipwig.  He's given Moist a lot of power already, along with tons of attention and guidance.  And I think Moist would be a fantastic Patrician!  Unlike Vetinari, he could be beloved and infuriating and endlessly fascinating to the public.  Where Vetinari is tolerated but scarcely loved, Moist's reign could be more like Zaphod Beeblebrox, or Lord Julius from _Cerebus_.

Tiffany Aching is obviously cut out to be one of the greatest witches of them all... probably THE greatest.  But that doesn't mean that she'll be able to become ""head witch"" (the leader they don't have :D ) overnight.  The key problem, I think, is that the Chalk is pretty far from Lancre, so teaming up with Nanny and Agnes will be tricky.  I think the next generation of witch books will probably feature more travel (as communication tech continues to bring the Disc closer together), with Tiffany often aching for her home.

Lady Margolotta may never feel the need to retire, of course.  But I can imagine her wanting a change of lifestyle some day.  The politics of control is a wonderful game, but as she says, the greatest control is self-control.  I could see her leaving her castle and studying in the Hublands, maybe.  Rumor has it some of the monks up there *really* know a few things about control.

But of course she couldn't leave without finding a successor, and who better than Mr. Nutt?  Nutt has many qualities of a great leader.  He's hyper-intelligent and hyper-competent at everything he does.  He can defeat almost anyone in personal combat, but believes in non-violence whenever possible.  He has the sponsorship of Mightily Oats, who has the trust of the mountain orcs and goblins and Om-Knows-What-Else.  If needed, he could raise an army to unite Uberwald, but he wouldn't do that, would he?

Nutt has one more possible advantage in politics:  Since he's no human, dwarf, werewolf, or vampire, he is equally untrustworthy to almost everyone... and so he's universally acceptable.

Vimes... well... who could replace Vimes?  Nobody.  So nobody will.  Carrot and Angua will head the Watch officially, of course.  But it will be totally transformed.

In *Snuff*, we saw a huge expansion of Ankh Morpork's law enforcement practice.  Vimes took his jurisdiction quite far indeed, and he got away with it.  It's clear that in the future the Watch will work much more closely with provincial forces.  Young coppers like Feeney and Jefferson will be in daily communication with Pseudopolis Yard, effectively expanding the Watch far beyond the city walls.  Commander Angua will be the best-informed head copper in the history of head coppers, and Commander Carrot will be as universally respected as Vimes ever was, but with a lot less burning hatred and a lot more of people belatedly realizing they've been outsmarted.

Thinking about these things has made me a lot more optimistic about the future of the series.  Of course things are going to be much different after Terry goes, but things are always different!  The Discworld changes in leaps and bounds.  It's always ready for young leaders and young storytellers.

My mother passed away last Friday, suffering the same emburggerance that Terry Practchett is enduring. She was dyslexic but an avid reader and when I was fairly young she hannded me Eric and told me that I'd probably like it. I'm also dyslexic and had never really liked reading until she handed me that book. From then on I was hooked and Practchett was my vice. Without the two of them there are so many literary worlds that I would have never discovered and would have been so much poorer.

Pratchett has always been so positive about death (DEATH...) and it seems fitting that I should read something of his as he was a favourite author of both of us.

Off the top of my head, I have the commentary from one of the Witches books about how no one is truely gone until every clock they have have wound has wound down and until their name is never uttered again but I'm not sure what book it came from.

Throughout the novels he says many things about what it is to be a Witch. We get a whole vocabulary of brilliant simple ideas (first sight and second thoughts, spill words, boffo, knowing when not to use magic, headology).


“They know that people need witches; they need the unofficial people who understand the difference between right and wrong, and when right is 
wrong and when wrong is right. The world needs the people who work around the edges. They need the people who can deal with the little bumps and inconveniences. And little problems. After all, we are almost all human. Almost all of the time.”

The Watch's motto, ""Fabricati diem, pvnc""  Canis Latinicus for ""Make my day, punk."" But not really


According to the Discworld Companion, the new Watch motto is 'Viae sunt semper tutus pro hominibus probis' - 'The Streets Are Always Safe for Honest Folk'. It's not clear what Vimes thinks about this, given that The City Watch Diary stated he previously vetoed the motto ""The Innocent Have Nothing To Fear"" on the grounds that ""the innocent had a great deal to fear, partly from the guilty, and partly from the sort of people who think the innocent have nothing to fear"". 

The motto of Unseen University is ""Nunc id vides, nunc ne vides""— now you see it, now you don't. 

Unseen University's unofficial motto is ""Eta Beta Pi"" (""Eat a better pie"", or possibly ""Eat a bit of pie"").

The baker's, ""Quod Subigo Farinam"" (""Because I knead the dough""). Also in Feet of Clay are Excretus Ex Est Altitudine"" and ""Depositatum De Latrina"", Canis Latinicus for respectively ""shat on from a great height"" and ""dropped down the toilet"". 

The motto of the Dunmanifestin mission in The Last Hero is ""Morituri Nolumus Mori"" - ""We who are about to die don't want to"". Needless to say, it was suggested by Rincewind. 

The motto of the Ankh-Morpork Fools' Guild is ""Dico, dico, dico"" - ""I say, I say, I say..."" 

Assassins' guild: ""Nil Mortifi Sine Lucre"" (No killing without payment). 

The guild of Seamstresses has a very similar mottor, ""Nil Volupti Sine Lucre"" (No pleasure without payment). 

The Sto-Helits go with the unsubtle ""Non Timetis Messor"": ""Don't Fear The Reaper""

In Small Gods, the Quisition's unwritten motto is ""Cuius testiculos habes, habeas cardia and cerebellum"" - ""When you have their balls (translated to ""full attention"") in your grip, their hearts and minds will follow"". 

The Alchemists (""Omnis Qui Coruscat Est Or"" - ""All That Glitters Is Gold""), Conjurers (""Nunc Ille Est Magicus"" - ""Now That's Magic!"", a Paul Daniels reference) and the Gamblers (""Excretus Ex Fortuna"" - ""Shit Out Of Luck""). 

General Tacticus ""Veni Vidi Vici"". or, as Vimes said ""Veni Vermini Vomiti"" (""I came, I got ratted [drunk], I threw up"") or ""Veni Veneri Vamoosi"" (""I came, I caught an embarrassing sexual disease, I left""). 

Lord Vetinari's: Veni, Vici, VETINARI but  the Vetinari family motto-""Si non confectus, non reficiat.""- If it ain't broke, don't fix it

    (Chorus)
    Ohhh a wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end,
    A wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end,
    If there's only one thing on which you can dep-e-e-end!
    It's that a wizard's staff 'as a knob on the end!

    SONG STARTS HERE

    I saw in Ankh-Morpork the other day,
    An unlicensed thief see 'is luck slip away,
    'e nicked off with a bag but then froze up in dre-e-ad!
    As out popped a knob, clonked 'im over the 'ead!

    [Chorus]

    A wizard once went on a visit to Klatch,
    The weather was in an 'orrendous dry patch,
    So he slapped 'is knob right in the palm of 'is 'a-a-and!
    And he spread wide 'is magic all over the land!

    [Chorus]

    Down Uberwald way they're a funny old lot,
    'owever you look it don't matter a jot,
    But even there they know if you see a kno-o-o-ob!
    A wizard is usin' 'is tool for the job!

    [Chorus]

    Some Fourecksian bandits were right soddin' thick,
    Tried robbin' a man all 'unched over a stick,
    But 'e flourished it then an' 'e started to la-a-a-ugh!
    Cause they all saw the knob on the end of 'is staff!

    [Chorus]

    A friend of a friend asked a wizard, you see,
    'ow come the knob on 'is staff was so key,
    The only thing on which all wizards agree,
    So 'e gestured 'im close 'an 'e said:
    “Ohhh, really my boy, do you truly not know?
    As a wizard stores power 'is knob starts to grow,
    Without it you can't get the magic to flo-o-o-w,
    You just tap on the end, and there out your spell blows!”

    [Chorus]

Sir Terry had a contest on Facebook for interesting members of the guild of merchants and I was one of five winners.  The winners as posted on Facebook were (in no order): 

* Jack Lilley: Mown and Grown - A Zombie gardening service, experts in pushing up the flowers.

* Kevin Haw (me): Piecemeal's House of Avant-Garde Taxidermy - Their primary business is taxidermy made from ""leftovers"" of various animals from other taxidermists and restaurants. Ms. Fidelity Piecemeal, however, thrives on the limitations of her art and delights in her fanciful creations, fancying herself as the Yoko Ono of taxidermy.

* Lord Weakstorm, head of Guild of Gardeners, Gnomes, Ditchers (1), and Grave-makers (2): The Curious Bush - Ankh-Morpork’s first and finest shop entirely devoted to the horticultural connaisseur.

* Ned Alexander: Mr Hackett's '2nd hand' prosthetics.

* Mr Deacon-Bastyon Duncan, Head Hole Maker: The Whole Hole, an emporium of the finest crafted button hole all produced on site by hand.

I've attempted contact through their Twitter and Facebook accounts multiple times but have received no response.

I'm really bummed and just wanted to vent and warn people not to give them any money since they clearly suck

I'm reading them all in chronological order, and so far I think this is one of the darkest books, with possibly the highest body count (if you count rats) and the most morbid and serious subject matter.  I loved the book - don't get me wrong - but I would not consider this a child's book.  

Spoilers below: 

There's gruesome deaths by trappings and poison, cannibalism, killing, biting of the unutterables and explosive diarrhea.  Well that last two  bits were pretty funny, but I have to admit I was a little disturbed at how many regular rats got killed by the talking ones and by Maurice.

Also, I'm struggling to remember what's happened in the previous books. Is this normal? I tend to finish a Discworld book and pick the next one up the following day! I feel like I'd need to reread them all multiple times, which obviously would take a long time!

Sometimes foils or semi-major characters that you wouldn't expect to see outside of 'their' books show up in the darndest places, though; which ones are your favorite?


&gt;(I don't see spoiler tags on the sidebar, so I'll just say there are spoilers from Carpe Jugulum and Unseen Academicals below.)

As an example, my favorite would be Reverend Oats, from Carpe Jugulum. Throughout the book he progresses from a doubtful, wishy-washy priest into a guy with real fervor and zeal. I thought that was the end of it, but in Unseen Academicals it is revealed that Nutt was freed from his imprisonment by Oats, who had left Lancre to preach the word of Om in far Uberwald."	t5_2rh3j	True

I will admit I am relatively new to the series, having only started recently and only up to Small Gods(publication order, so my 13th book, I suppose), but of what I've read so far, publication order makes the most sense.  References and such to previous books are thrown in, and even if told from wildly varying perspectives, it does seem to be in one relatively solid time line thus far.  And not that Guards! Guards! is not quite good, but it doesn't stand out all that much in a series built of books that are, all in all, fantastic.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but to me it just seems odd to read the 8th book in a series first, or read single groups threads out of the story line.  Publication order seems practically perfect.  And that's probably why the books came out in that order.

**Edit:** Okay wow, I was not expecting this strong of a response, or such overall dislike of the first couple Discworld novels.  Maybe I'm odd, but I thought they were great and they really drew me into the series.

He happened to be friends with Josh Kirby, the illustrator, who lived nearby. Josh Kirby was somewhat of a recluse but somehow my boyfriend's dad convinced him to let him bring me to see him. 

I remember being scared shitless because I wasn't that keen on the book covers and feeling a bit like I was intruding as well, as my boyfriend's dad kept telling me about how reclusive Josh Kirby was (though he said he came out once to paint chalk drawings on the street when the child of a local school were doing this).

I ended up in a bare but wonderful cottage, full wall to wall of huge canvases of art far better than I thought.  Josh Kirby's work is so much better seen in the flesh than stretched across a cover, they're gems! I was shown round, explained through each canvas, given a cup of tea and Josh Kirby was incredibly sweet to a nervous 14 year old wannabe illustrator. He also amused me by telling me how he reserved the revolving display of prints for 'Pratchett wannabes who made him money', and I could see exactly what he meant. I spent a very happy afternoon drinking tea and staring at his walls, while he very bashfully talked me through everything and seemed as shy of me as I was of him.

The Truth was either about to be released or just released, and Thief of Time was not even heard of - yet he showed me the paintings of both. I was giddy as a kipper trying to read in everything about this new book from his painting, while he was telling me how he normally wasn't given a new project so soon and with so little detail (it was still being written!), so I can't even remember if the art I saw was the final cover. I remember the colour scheme was the same, and I think it was close enough if not the same.

It was the last cover. Josh Kirby died a year later. I feel honoured to have shared that moment with him. He signed my copy of Guards! Guards!, which I happened to have with me without knowing I was going to meet him, and happened to be the first Discworld book I read. While it was the last time I saw my boyfriend, and for a 14 year old that felt like the end of the world, I felt this more than made up for that! As a Discworld fan and wannabe illustrator I couldn't have picked a better 'date'. It was a rare moment and a perfect one."	t5_2rh3j	True

Not one of the modern ones I just never saw the point of it despite being forced to participate in it by the school system and always disliked the religious mindset. So reading through Small Gods theres this exchange between Brutha and Didactylos;

&gt;'I know about sureness,' said Didactylos. Now the light irascible tone had drained out of his voice. 'I remember &gt;before I was blind, I went to Omnia once. This was before the borders were closed, when you still let people &gt;travel. And in your Citadel I saw a crowd stoning a man to death in a pit. Ever seen that?'
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'It has to be done,' Brutha mumbled. 'So the soul can be shriven and — '
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'Don't know about soul. Never been that kind of a philosopher,' said Didactylos. 'All I know is, it was a horrible sight.'
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'The state of the body is not — '
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'Oh, I'm not talking about the poor bugger in the pit,' said the philosopher. 'I'm talking about the people throwing the stones. **They were sure all right. They were sure it wasn't them in the pit**. You could see it in their faces. So glad that it wasn't them that they were throwing just as hard as they could.'

And it summed everything up. All the general evilness and mentality of human beings en masse with some kind of ideology. And summed up in such a pithy way. I know some people dismiss discworld because of its esotericness and its ""british"" sense of humour but Pterry definitely has something. Something that would be circlejerked about if say Dawkins or Hitchens wrote about it. And the thing about that is it isn't the primary plot point or conceit of the book, its just an aside in a good story. "	t5_2rh3j	True

(here we go gang!  voting will commence as soon as I click ""submit"", and will continue for about 24 hours or so.  Tomorrow night, I'll tabulate the votes and eliminate one player.  Then Table 2 will play a round, and, well, just look at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/18m8dq/announcing_the_first_periodic_ankhmorpork_cripple/) to see what it's all about.)

... You guys are amazing.  I could not possibly have anticipated such a high level of awesomeness!  thank you so much to all the voters, and *especially* to the folks who are providing such wonderful comments and stories.

Round 1 is almost over!  We'll give it about two more hours, and then the lowest-voted player will be eliminated, and Round 2 will begin.  Six new players, *many* new possibilities for interaction.

And of course there will be the game summary!  i'll PM the redditor who nominated the ""winner"", and see if they feel like writing a few sentences, or paragraphs, or novels.  if not, then I'll probably post something myself.  Keep watching this thread, and look for the Round 2 thread as well!

**EDIT 1:** So, the character cards from the DW game have been split into 6 groups:

* Sybil Vimes - cards are mostly housestaff and watchmen Cmmdr Vimes would trust to protect his wife in this night of madness. (She refused to leave the city - ""We Must Do Our Duty!"". NB: Young Sam is at Ramkin Hall; he's fine.)
* Sam Vimes - cards are watchmen and a few vagabonds that Cmmdr Vimes uses when necessary.
* Assassins - those men of learning, money and highly funded murder. Pooling their funds previously, they have 'legally' gained control of the Bank of AM - 10m AM$ can buy a lot of Mr Slant's time. Cards are assassins and bank characters.
* 'Killers' - thugs and killers. Tensions came to a head, and they forcibly took control of the Post Office as 'collateral'.
* Local Wizards - the Dean came back to AM for the day, and all of a sudden it's Dead Man's Pointy Shoes. These wizards are loyal to Archchancellor Ridcully, and come equipped with a few spells up their sleeve.
* Uprise Wizards - wizards who, in need of throwing some well deserved fireballs, defected to the Dean for the day. Also come equipped with a few spells.

Each character in the game has a variety of stats associated *(a simple 1-5 metric, many numbers stolen from Guards Guards - if someone knows how to play that game, I'd love to know.)*, and William de Worde - AKA the GM - plays out the simple scenario using the relevant stats. The players can give simple orders to their characters *(""ignore the jewels, but attempt to kill any Assassins you see."")*, but the character will need to be smart enough or loyal enough to understand and follow them!

Each mission has three stats that will be needed - trying to break up a pub brawl req. Strength, Intimidation, Cunning (or whatever - intimidation is fictional), and the sums of stats for each character tell of how well they do, but characters will interact in surprising ways! 

Each player has a list of DOs, DO NOTs, and extra information to play the game. Standard MM fare (anonymous characters and whatnot), and away you go!

**tl;dr - characters split up, given missions, GM uses his imagination unless anyone out there doesn't want to do so, in which case I'll create more scripted events for public use.**"	t5_2rh3j	True

So, I was thinking... a quiz would be really good.  Something that asks a few questions about someone's personality, humour preferences, the type of social commentary they're interested in, and then recommends a first book.

a) Witches - *Equal Rites*

b) Death - *Mort*

e) The Watch - *Guards! Guards!*

f) Other - *Moving Pictures* or *Pyramids*

g) Wizards - *Sourcery*

I know I'm being a bit controversial in suggesting the wizard path should start with *Sourcery*, and it might be my person prejudice against Rincewind (who is an annoying and boring character)... but I really don't think *The Colour of Magic* is a great intro into the series.

Does anything like this already exist?  If not, does anyone want to help me create one?

The premise is that the UU has been tasked by Vetinari to provide a magical means to increase foodstuff production for Ankh-Morpork.

Due to the shocking levels of incompetence and laziness among most UU staff, the project is delegated to Ponder Stibbons (With Ridcully poking around and peeking in on occasion).

Predictably, some hiccup derails the experiment, causing Ponder Stibbons' magical equipment to run dangerously out of control, and resulting in the generation of dangerous megafauna and megaflora (Success!!) in the immediate region surrounding the research site.

The players (Hired by Ridcully) are tasked with shutting down Stibbons' experiment, finding Stibbons, and salvaging what they can or the research data if possible.

Maybe it's just me being dim, but I'd tried all the major ereading apps I could find on Android market and there was always something that they struggled with - the majority allowing you to jump to read a footnote, but not providing any way of getting back to where you were, leaving you cursing and trying to guess the page to jump back to, or even cursing and trying to figure out how to quickly navigate back 100 pages.

Recently gave FBReader a try and found that it supports perfectly skipping to a footnote and back again and even remembers the positions of previous footnoted pages.  Now happily enjoying my Discworld collection again without glaring at the little * and ignoring them.

He spoke about his life thus far, working in the power plant and his issue with book shelves amongst other things.

What are people's thoughts on getting a group of people together. Like this whole subreddit, or anyone that wanted to join up, picking a Discworld book and then each getting a randomly assigned word from that book tattoo'd. I heard about this idea ages ago when someone was writing a short story and they had people sign up to get a word from that story tattoo'd on them. It was completely random, some people got just ""a"" and ""the"" and some people got names, longer word etc. I've been fascinated by the idea of being connected to 100's or 1000's of random strangers by a tattoo. You could get the tattoo done anywhere on your body, in any font, mixed in to any other designs. It would be kind of a secret way of showing your love for a book and give this sense of companionship and solidarity.

Anyways, I just thought I'd throw it out there since it has been something I've wanted to do for quite a while now. It's totally fine if it's not something you're interested in but I'd love to hear opinions and suggestions. Someday I will find a willing group! :)

EDIT: Wow, I had actually kind of forgotten about this post (I know, one day goes by and I forget), mostly because the last time I brought up the idea on r/tattoos I got royally shot down. I'm so excited that people are interested! It will definitely be a bit of a process, deciding on book or passage, then deciding on what book, then possibly deciding on a passage but I'm in if you are. I also love the idea of putting the quote then author then book like AdmiralFace suggested but that could definitely be optional.

I literally just finished reading *Mort*. I loved it, but found myself unable to understand one joke - at least, I'm not sure I did. I'd like to know if I laughed-out-loud at the intended one.

It's from where Cutwell's doorknob asks Mort to unstick him after Mort wonders if Princess Keli and the wizard Cutwell could be, ahem, getting busy. Mort gets on Binky, looking very much like Death.

&gt; The doorknocker thought quickly. 'Fir?' it said. 

&gt; 'What did you ask me to do?' 

&gt; 'Unftick me?' 

&gt; 'I don't intend to.'
   
&gt; 'Fine,' said the doorknocker, 'fine. That's okay by me. I'll just ftick around, then.' 

&gt; It watched Mort canter off along the street and shuddered with relief, knocking itself gently in  its nervousness.

Has anybody seen those forum threads?  It's something like: you're given a list of characters that each start with, say, 5 points.  Each successive poster can add a point to one character while removing a point from another, and if a character reaches 0, they're eliminated.

Based on that, here's what I came up with.  Does it sound like it would be workable/fun?  Please offer advice and suggestions.

***
THE FIRST PERIODIC ANKH-MORPORK CRIPPLE MISTER ONION INVITATIONAL

**sponsored by Hoyle, God of Gaming**

*Catering by Sister Drull*


For three days, anyone can nominate a Discworld character in the official thread.  One character per reply.  Please don't duplicate, upvote instead.  After the nomination period is over, we'll take the highest-voted 12 characters.

Then we play a series of games, one game per day.  The games are just threads with each character's name listed for voting.  Anyone can post anything they want in the thread, but the only thing that matters in the end are upvotes (and downvotes!).  (In my mind, people wouldn't just automatically vote for their favorite character.  We would actually ask ourselves, ""who at this table would really be most likely to win?  What strategies might they use?  What alliances might form, and would they be adhered to?""  Of course noone really knows the rules of Cripple Mr. Onion, but that fact will be of help to us because it means we can freely apply the [Rule of Cool](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) and the [Rule of Funny](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny).) At the end of each round, the lowest-voted player will be eliminated.

The schedule will look something like this (assuming that the last-listed character is eliminated in each round):

* DAY 1 players: A, B, C, D, E, F
* DAY 2: G, H, I, J, K, L
* DAY 3: A, G, B, H, C
* DAY 4: I, D, J, E, K
* DAY 5: A, I, G, D
* DAY 6: B, J, H, E
* DAY 7: A, B, I
* DAY 8: J, G, H
* DAY 9: A, B, J, G
* DAY 10: A, B, J
* DAY 11 HEADS UP!!!: A, B

After each round, there will be a summary of the game.  **THE PERSON WHO NOMINATED THE WINNER GETS TO WRITE IT** if they want to.  If they don't want to, they can make other arrangements or I will write it.

After day 11, we will have a winner!  There will be rejoicing, and a collective sigh of relief that it didn't turn into a bloodbath.

BY THE WAY... the tournament itself will not take place in this humdrum dimension.  Hoyle is not bound by normal spacetime, and is making special arrangements to contact each player in his or her dreams.  Consequently, ANYONE might show up, past or future, living or dead!

***

2/18/13 UPDATE 12:08pm PST:

Well, the response isn't overwhelming, but what the heck, let's go for it!

**Nominations will continue until I see that we have *TWELVE* players, and then for, oh, say, *EXACTLY 24 HOURS* afterward... and then it's showtime!**

***

2/18/13 UPDATE 03:43pm PST:

Okay, we have enough nominees!  **The final twelve will be determined by votes, tabulated when I get home from work tomorrow, so in about twenty-six hours!**  (still plenty of time to cheat, so start making those throwaways!)  And don't be afraid to downvote!  I have a feeling that's the only way we're going to break some of these ties.

***

2/19/13 UPDATE 04:30pm PST:

Alright, it's almost time!  Hoyle is excitedly squaring up the packs of cards and brushing down all the chairs.  Sister Drull is standing by with a very large tray of meat pasties.  Soon the hour will be upon us.

(I was wondering how to account for reddit's infamous ""vote-fuzzing"" (or whatever causes upvotes and downvotes to seemingly fluctuate), and I've decided that our official policy is this:

1.  Bugger it

     A.  (for a game of soldiers)

In other words, I'll use the numbers that show up on my screen at the time when I'm looking at it.  And those will be the numbers and all other numbers will be disregarded with extreme impoliteness.)

***Look for the new thread in an hour or so!!!***

As the topic so suggests, I'm playing with the idea of getting an e-reader as moving my books from place to place is becoming a problem in terms of storage. I also like to travel light and even paperbacks stack up when other things are packed alongside them. 

To that end, I'm thinking of getting an e-reader. 

The main thing stopping me? Being sure I can get the books I want on (it). That starts with the Discworld series.

I'm completely clueless about shopping for e-readers - so is it even possible to get the Discworld books on one? If so, where should I look?

Now I ask you veteran Discworld readers - is there anything I have missed in Going Postal which would help my reading of Making Money? Should I stop and buy Going Postal before reading any further?

In this timeline, Om and Brutha failed to defeat the deacon and both perished. Vorbis went on to become ruler of Omnia, defeating the armies that had come to depose him and setting out to expand the empire even further.

Lord Vetinari sees the ever growing borders of Omnia, and begins to prepare. Alas, Ankh-Morpork has no army. Only the Watch, The Unseen University, the various guilds, and of course the Post-Office. They also have friends in Uberwald, Klatch, and the other surrounding nations that owe them obscene amounts of money, though Vetinari can by no means simply order them to war.

But Vorbis is no fool. He planned the end of the war with Ephebe before it had even begun. And where Vetinari has in the past displayed hints of humanity, the Cenobiarch is utterly ruthless. The sheer number of soldiers now at his disposal is vast even compared to all the might of Vetinari's allies. And he knows that the Patrician will be up to something.

UPDATE 12:23pm PST

Vimes and Death are neck-and-neck for the lead!  Meanwhile, poor C.M.O.T. Dibbler is bringing up the rear.  His legendary salesmanship doesn't seem to be working very well!

UPDATE 04:02pm PST

We're getting down to the wire on Round 2!  About two more hours, then we'll kick another hapless player to the curb.  We'll shuffle the 10 remaining players and split them once more into two Tables... and then... we will commence a'partyin'!  (and by that I mean voting.)

T3ppic	14	6	21	"Having just finished snuff it's obvious the Vimes story needs closure. Perhaps with him dying. Carrot and Angua need to marry or something grim. 

Id like to see more Rincewind. Having been sidelined as professor of cruel and unusual geography is a waste of a character. Having being introduced to discworld via the adventure games Rincewind and all the Wizards have a special place in my heart. 

Teppic (Pteppic) needs a new adventure. Perhaps as a video game. The assassins guild and all the narrative that goes with it is too good to waste and a game (think assassins creed but in ankh morpok) would be amazing. 

A final vetinari novel would be good. Maybe to tie in with Vimes. The trope of the tyrant slayer grandchild and a tyrant would be too good to refuse. It's pretty obvious Drumknott would be the antagonist. 

I don't really care about Moist von Lipwig although I did enjoy both novels and if it wasn't for Watchmen it would be my favourite books. 

Granny Weatherwax needs one more adventure before she dies as well. 

Susan is one of my favourite fictional characters but the whole Death's Granddaughter is played out. 

I don't think ive left anyone major out. And although it seems Ghoulsish to speculate on Id prefer the king of literature universes to have closure rather than continue on for the sake of continuing on.

If you haven't read The Long Earth yet you may want to look away
because its hard to review The Long War without including spoilers
for The Long Earth.

The Long War is set a decade after Joshua and Sally return from
their long adventure with Lobsang.  In the preceding ten years the
Black Corporation have given the technology behind the Mark Twain
(Lobsang's ship) to the world and now 'twains' are a fairly common
sight over the Long Earth.

Joshua feels his travelling days are over and has settled down with
his wife Helen and his son Dan deep in the Long Earth.  His life,
however, is turned upside down when Sally visits and asks him to
help with protecting the Long Earth trolls because they are being
badly mistreated by humans.

Along with Joshua and Sally, we also get to see most of The Long
Earth's characters again and its interesting to see how a decade in
the Long Earth has affected each of them.  It also introduces a
whole raft of characters as well as two new sentient species - the
beagles and the kobolds.

Once again, like its predecessor The Long War is a slow boil story.
You get lots of disparate threads that slowly progress the story
forward with no real obvious idea for the reader how they are going
to resolve.  Then suddenly something dramatic happens and the pace
suddenly changes.

I really did enjoy the book but at the same time I feel that it
seemed to take too long to go anywhere.  I loved how the
relationships between the characters both old and new developed
through the story.  When the tension did build it was gripping and
at times there were some poignant moments.

If you enjoyed The Long Earth then you should definitely read The
Long War.  If you haven't read The Long Earth, read that first and
see if you like it!

I'm just wondering if you guys would be able to offer me a little help?
A few months ago my sister passed away, she was quite a big Discworld fan, more so than anyone else in my family. (I'm ashamed to admit I haven't read any of the novels yet but I do plan to start soon!)

Anyways we're finally getting around to burying her ashes and I've been tasked with reading a small piece or passage at the ceremony, so I was just wondering if you guys have any suggestions on what might be a good bit to read, seeing as I'm not familiar with the books?

What I'm looking for is maybe something about life or death, preferably with a bit of Pratchett humour thrown in (even if it seems a bit inappropriate or off-colour humour!).

Any help at all would be appreciated!! Thank you so much in advance."	t5_2rh3j	True

I spent 2+ years in the uk between 2004 and 2006, wich gave me the opportunity to discover PTerry. And it was a brutal and complete immersion, in 2 years I read everything from the color of magic to Guards, Guards.

And then I got bored.

I stopped at monstrous regiment. I borrowed it, and returned it without readng more than 5 pages. And the only TPerry I read ever since are what I consider ""old classics"", like the witch or death series.

Ouch! Stop throwing things!

What happened is, I completely loved the ""heroic fantasy with a twist"" dimension of PTerry, but got bored by the ""fantasy metaphoric description of the modern revolution"" of His late books. 
I'm talking about Going postal, the truth, making money...

so, here are my 2 questions : 

1. Am I the only one feeling like that?

2. Do you think I should bother ordering  (I'm back in france now)the latest books : Hat Full, Wintersmith, Thud, Unseen academicals?
Or should I expect to find the same reluctances as for the so called ""industrial revolution"" series?

Thanx for your help!

I've read Nightwatch quite a few times (it's my favourite in the series), and listened to Stephen Briggs' performance of the audiobook almost as many times. But one thing confuses me: what was the original link to Lilac?

At the beginning of the book, Vimes and some of the Watch are wearing the Lilac in remembrance of Treacle Mine Road. But the only link we have (as the reader) to the Lilac, once Vimes/Keel has helped out in the revolution is that they split up while being chased by Carcer and his men.

So supposing Carcer wasn't involved in the original timeline, are there any clues as to the reason that the Lilac is so important to the remembrance?

The only thing I can think of is that, around the time of the revolution, the Lilac would have been blooming. Perhaps Vimes' influence was to make the Lilac more prominent and important in the remembrance?"	t5_2rh3j	True

I went through The Colour of Magic and thought it was a good book, but didn't really grab me like the Hitchhiker's Guide series. Nevertheless, I decided to try Small Gods, which I just finished today. I thought that was a good story, but it went at a slow pace in my opinion and really didn't pick up til halfway through. It was a good read, but didn't grip me like I expected it would. I still want to give the Discworld series a chance, but nothing's really taken root for me. I want to give the series a good shot before I write it off or anything, so I'm wondering what books/arcs you guys would suggest next.

1322101721.0	mnfx0	Yes, but have you checked out the audiobooks?	turnerjer	8	2	9	"Pterry is my favorite writer, and I've done all the DWs at least three times now... some of my faves (Monstrous Regiment, the Aching books, all the Watch books since Men At Arms) probably ten times.

And let me say: the audiobooks are WAY BETTER.

Comedy as an art form has always had a bit of trouble with the written word.  It relies on surprise and timing, which can be difficult to manage on a page, where the reader's eyes can often skim over critical words or punctuation marks.  Also, the eye is drawn to white space, so I, for one, sometimes find myself reading short paragraphs and dialogue, then backtracking to the long descriptive passages at the top of the page.  Needless to say, this can mess up the careful timing and delicate layering of meaning and tension.

Furthermore, puzzling out the Feegle's speech takes some practice, and I sometimes get derailed by a difficult word or phrase.  This too can break the flow.

And, put simply, comedy is funnier when it's performed (by a skilled actor) than when it's read.

Stephen Briggs (and for the earlier books, Nigel Planer) are both masterful comic actors.  Both of them (though I prefer Stephen) can perfectly capture the nuances of mood and emotion in a simple line of dialogue.  And their deadpan British delivery is a perfect fit for Pterry's observational narrative voice.

What's more, a DW book in audio form provides 8-12 hours of entertainment, while I might finish a book in half that time.  And you don't miss a single word.

Do yourself a favor!  If you jog, or drive a lot, or (like me) need the sound of human voices to lull you to sleep, buy your favorite DW in audio form and experience it in a new way.  I guarantee you'll catch a few jokes that you missed before.  Or check out your local library.  Most libraries have a pretty good audiobook selection.

There are, of course, other ways.  It's been reported that Pterry's books hold the record for ""most shoplifted"".  But that's not cool, so if you absolutely must ""try before you buy"", just don't forget about the ""buy"" part.

Seriously, I'm passionate about this.  Give it a try, and gods bless Stephen and Nigel.

The rest, as you all know, are available as mass market paperbacks.

When asked about it at NYCC, the Editor-in-Chief of HarperCollins claimed that all the previous Tiffany Aching books were available as trade paperbacks.

*LIAR!*

However, in the UK, *ISWM* is available as a mass market! And so that all of them will match, I wish to import it. I don't want to use Amazon.co.uk, because I'd rather support a small business, even if it's across the pond. If one of you could recommend a bookshop that wouldn't mind doing business via email or phone, that'd be lovely. If they can't, but one of you lovely Ankh-Morporkians would love to act as a proxy, I'd love you forever.

&gt;""Happily, it appears that the new deacon at the temple has suddenly heard the call.""

&gt;""What call?""

&gt;""I'm never very good at religious matters, but apparently he was filled with a burning desire to spread the good word to the benighted heathens,"" said Vetinari.

&gt;""I suggested Ting Ling.""

&gt;""That's right on the other side of the world!""

&gt;""Well, a good word can't be spread too far, Sergeant.""

&gt;""Well, at least it puts --""

1358965879.0	174vqp	Change in Magic?	austinmonster	5	1	5	"There is one question i've always had about the discworld.  There seems to be a massive change in the character of magic from the first few books, to the later.   In the first book, Rincewind describes a very ADnD wizard-type of magic user.  He says how you'll spend years memorizing a spell, just to cast it once and have to spend years re-memorizing it.  Compare this to later in the books when you see wizards slinging around magic missiles and fireballs with abandon, seemingly only limited by their amount of energy.  

When did magic become this fickle little beast that barely seemed to work, to something that somehow became reliable and plentiful?  I doubt any of UU's administration spent time memorizing thirty fireball spells in their mind.  

Someone told me once that the events of ""Sourcery"" changed the rules of magic, but I can't find anywhere in that book, or any other book, that indicates that is the truth.  

Did Terry just ""change his mind"" and want more traditional magic users?  What do you all think? Am I just missing one vital sentence somewhere?"	t5_2rh3j	True

It's a fun game, but it's *long* and *complicated* so you need to be prepared to spend 3 or 4 hours on your first play through, and about 2 hours on each one afterwards.

The object of the game is to return spells to the Unseen University from where they escaped into the city of Ankh-Morpork. The city is divided into quadrants by guild (Alchemists, Fools, Assassins, and Thieves), and each guild needs to return 5 out of 8 spells.   You go around to various points on the board winning over volunteers over to your cause either by charming them, or bribing them.  These volunteers will then run the spell back to the university for you.  Along the way, you can stop your opponents from getting the spells back to the university by having your volunteers sabotage them, or by summoning dragons, thereby preventing anything from happening in certain quadrants.  If all 4 dragons are summoned, then the game is over, everyone loses (I was way behind in our game, so I started going for this strategy :P).  

Like I said, this is a *long* game, but it is fun.  My buddies who played it with me have never read any of the books before, but they thought the cards were funny, and enjoyed the game.  There are RPG elements, money, spells, armor, and dragons.  Plus, while the other two were trying to return their last spells, requiring two die rolls from them (a 6 and a 7 each on a d8), I worked my way around the board and nearly staged a comeback.

Can anyone clear up *which* book that was, so I can go back and read it?

I wanted to start this thread as a place for we fans to come together and talk about the series and what brought us to it, and what keeps us coming back for more.

There is something wonderful and special about the series that I don't think has ever been done before, and probably never will be done again. Sir Terry's writing is funny, witty, emotional and compelling. His heroes are brave and loyal, but they are real, with their flaws and weakness, desires and stengths. His villains are truly wicked, but deep and varied in motivation and type of evil. Each character is hand-crafted and unique.

His stories are driven by characters as opposed to plot, and he structures his world with such immense detail. His satire is top-notch and most of his humor is devised from wordplay. Reading Discworld has enriched my life in so many ways- as I read I feel myself being drawn into the world, like it's my own personal place to escape to.

What has brought you to the series? I love Discworld so much and I'm trying to share it with as many people as possible. I truly think there is a magic to the books that can only be understood when you read one."	t5_2rh3j	True

By which I mean that if you had described the way things work in discworld I would have chalked it up as Young Adult fiction. And in truth there are a few too many sad digressions into fart humor than I would care for in pratchett’s work but the writing makes up for it. Just finished Monstrous Regiment and I really enjoyed it but it too had a few flaws in my opinion. I wish he had spent more time on the ending, which in my opinion feels a bit like it was tacked on as an afterthought and not up to the standards of the rest of the book. There were some other thin patches in the narrative where I would have liked to have seen things fleshed out a bit more. I know we saw the conflict through the eyes of the protagonist but there were issues with the ending of the story where I would have liked to have had a better look at the overall state of things in Borogravia. Overall though I liked it and I’m on to the next Pratchett book as soon as time permits.	t5_2rh3j	True

For me Terry Pratchett effected my whole life. From the age of eight my mother got me to read the Discworld series, starting with Pyramids, and from there it spiraled, I read all of his books and still do loving every second of them. At the age of eleven I realised that I wanted to follow in his footsteps and become a writer so I spent days writing, starting with poems, then short stories and then at 14 I finished my first book.

A vampire novel set on another world called Vampiric. Needless to say the book did not get published, released or was even very good but I kept writing until I had finished my next book, Black World: Instinct, a novel from a series similar to Kelly Armstrong's ""Women of other world"" series, about a Werewolf called Cadaras and his journey for revenge. This too did not sell or get published but I didn't give up because my sights were still set on Terry Pratchett.

Now, nearly a decade of hard work, sweat and tears my new novel Aerial Escape: Volume I - Where It All Began, a steampunk-esque series about a young aristocrat that becomes a skytraveller was released on kindle and has begun selling. I have contacted several agents and if I'm lucky this will be the one.

I never truly realised how much he gave me, he gave me a dream, a passion and an ideal to strive towards. Not only that but he taught me many great life lessons about people, the world and politics/religion. He made me who I am today, so what about you?

TL:DR I am who I am thanks to Terry Pratchett, what about you?"	t5_2rh3j	True

They're both ""Rincewind travelogue"" books, but in *LC* almost all the characters he meets are friendly, guileless, and immediately comprehensible.  There's danger to the world, but it's metaphysical, and created from outside, whereas the problems in *IT* are caused by the personalities of the people of the Counterweight Continent... by traits of the Auriental psyche, we might say.

Reading both books in succession, it's extremely obvious which culture Pterry prefers.  Aside from nature and a single encounter with bandits, almost nothing bad happens to Rincewind in Fourecks.  *LC* doesn't even have an antagonist!

1340120995.0	va3hd	In which book were the clacks towers first introduced?	goldragon	2	2	2	"I've been reading all of the orange/yellow designated Discworld novels as noted in the [Reading Order Guide](http://www.blog.justinboden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/the-discworld-reading-order-guide-20.jpg) and am currently on Going Postal.  

I know that the ""clacks towers"" or ""semaphore towers"" were (in my reading order) first referenced in one of the City Watch novels and after being initially puzzled I figured out what they were despite little explanation of their purpose or origin.  However after hitting the Industrial Revolution novels I now feel like the clacks towers should have been better explained, even had their own origin story told in an Industrial Revolution novel, and that maybe I've missed a book somewhere.  I did a search of the subreddit and saw some posts on how the clacks towers had real life inspiration from old visual telegraphy systems but no discussion on the origin of the clacks towers in the Discworld universe.  

So where did the clacks towers first pop up, who created it, did I miss something in the City Watch novels or did they just suddenly spring into existence in the Discworld universe?  Maybe some history of the clacks network is explained in Going Postal as I'm just about 20% into the book and I can see it's about the revival of the postal system to compete with the clacks monopoly."	t5_2rh3j	True

I thought they were phenomenal novels.  I did not read any more, because I stumbled upon the reading guide.  I wanted to have some semblance of order.

Fast forward a bit.  My wife bought me a Kindle in February, and I have since torn through every novel in the series, save the young adult ones.  I love most of them.  That said, Moving Pictures did nothing for me.  I would read just about any of the novels again, but Moving Pictures would not be among them."	t5_2rh3j	True

Nobby Nobbs- Sean Penn

Fred Colon- Jon Favreau

Captain Carrot- Heath Ledger (Yes I *know*)

Vetinari- Robert Downey Jr. He seems to fit the role for me, I dont know why.

Rincewind- This is the one character I'm mostly undecided on. Rowan Atkinson? Mackenzie Crook?

Mustrum Ridcully- Jeff Bridges

I'm not too sure on the other wizards, but I know Sean Connery *has* to play one.

Maybe I should look for some missing space in the dancers circle.

1373931791.0	1idj44	To explain...	smilie23	1	4	2	"To StayPuffGoomba -

Swamp Dragons are only black coz they are SWAMP Dragons.  I spoze in retrospect, yes, they shoulda been red but, there ya go...

Now, Vimes and Carrot are men of the city -- [i]polis[/i]-men, even, if you remember 'Men At Arms' -- and so are white, which also represents order and law (tho not necessarily 'Law &amp; Order').  But Carrot is also a Dwarf, which are always red, coming from the mountains.

Incidently, did you notice that Ankh-Morpork is black/white, being a city built on a plain, but the river is much more like a swamp.  It is also a city of law AND corruption, both giving life and taking it in equal measure.  That's why Vetinari is also black/white, being THE man of the city."	t5_2rh3j	True
