Sure there is some great tunes posted but nobody takes any notice of this place.

what is that? there is currently 17,563 of you

and honestly i would much rather prefer to be involved heavily in this sub-reddit over something like r/music or r/dubstep

Each post gets an average of 5-20 upvotes, often with very little/no discussion. This would imply the majority of people either don't see the posts, or don't care enough to vote.

There's a large variety of music based sub reddits that have less subscribers but more interaction, so I don't get the problem with this one.

I understand the meet ups are fairly successful but that seems to be about it when it comes to success in this sub.

So why are you subscribed?

The music is not truly culturally based because other than maybe London there is no cultural center of it.  Right now I'm an American listening to a Swedish producer based on a label in the UK (well, he was anyway) and I'm going to a club in LA tomorrow night to see a Brazilian DJ...  People that listen to DnB don't just listen to it, they're obsessive about it.  It's just seriously cool.  I've been into this music for well over a decade and it just doesn't get old.  When I meet someone who listens to it we can go on for hours and instantly become friends.  Just kind of a sort of drunk rant but in all seriousness, this music does connect every one on this subreddit.  We are all family, no matter what style you prefer.	t5_2r11p	True

1310134775.0	ik137	[PSA] Wear ear buds.	sk3tch	75	8	42	"If I could tell my younger self one thing it'd be to have worn ear buds when going out, the incessant ringing in my ears that comes randomly every now and then reminds me of that.

It's really not fucking worth it. A pair of [Alpine's](http://www.alpinehearingprotection.co.uk/consumer_musicsafe_pro.htm) cost like £10-20 quid, are comfortable and won't ruin your night - it'll filter out the crap frequencies that leave your ears feeling pushed in and you'll be able to hear fine immediately upon leaving. Better yet you'll be able to hear people in the club perfectly fine and way better than you normally would be able to. You definitely lose clarity in the higher ranges but you can make up for that with bass by standing right in front of the rig and letting it rattle your bones.

If you can afford it/care enough, get some professional moulded ones.

Seriously, wear ear buds. Reminded to post this by [Ed Rush's latest tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/Ed_Rush/status/89276856112656384), best wishes to him - fuck him going deaf.

September is Drum and Bass Month, so I would really appreciate it if some knowledgeable r/dnb lovers could point me in the right direction regarding what to listen to, what to learn, what to read, what to see and do, how to think, and anything else which might be useful.

If you're interested, here's my efforts so far:

January - [Folk](http://www.reddit.com/r/folk/comments/obfcf/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_folk_music/)

August - [Garage](http://www.reddit.com/r/garage/comments/xhvrs/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_garage_please/)

So yeah, I'm almost done now - just this and dubstep to go. It's been far more difficult than I thought it would be, just trying to find the time to get through everything, and then I plan on doing it all again next year! Still, I come to each genre a practical newbie, so by all means treat me like an ignorant fool. :)

Basically I've really gotten into it and mega stoked on it. So I guess I'm asking the following:

How did you get into DnB?
What was your initial reaction to hearing DnB? 
What track(s)/producer(s) got you into DnB? 
And any other info you feel is relevant. 

There isn't anyone that lives near me that's into DnB at all, so I have no one to talk to about it. :(

It worked pretty well until recently where we've clearly grown to a size where it's an issue again.

So, it's going up to 6 months :) Not much else we can do really except keep our beady eyes on it. All we ask is you take 2 seconds to search before posting 'that' track you're sure everyone will love.

I'd also like to take this time to thank all those that use the report button for reposted content, makes our lives a teeny bit easier. ..and of course the rest of the mod team who do a damn good job sifting through the chaff.

1368981104.0	1emxeh	EDMRadio is relaunching today as bside.fm. Launch party featuring r/dnb DJs!	Doomsaloto	47	2	3	"It's been almost a year since EDMradio launched as a place for redditor DJs to play the music they love online. Since then, we have established a warm and welcoming community on IRC, have hosted genre nights and have had plenty of DJs play some really great shows. But now we're taking things to the next level, and that is why we're renaming and rebranding as bside.fm.

The fact is, it became clear that we were not just about out EDM, but about any great music in general. We've had jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop, disco and anything else you could think of on the station up until now, and whilst we still definitely enjoy our electronic music, why would we decide to limit the amount of awesome music we can play?

If you're a listener, we're sure you'll find something that you'll enjoy; be it a great piece of music that you've never heard before - or just the comforting sounds of our excellent radio presenters voices as you sink in to your armchair.

If you're a DJ, sign up on our website and come mix. Beginners are welcome, our only rule is you have to really love your music and we ask that you have a mic to really make the shows 'live'. Please include a link to a social network with recent mixes up, just so we can make sure you're somewhat competent. 

We have music running all night brought to you by some of our station's more regular DJs and admins, so do join us and meet the crew in the live chat on the website.

1362093844.0	19fdze	My Thoughts on Netsky LIVE (bit of a rant)	bronze4lyf	53	11	70	"Just wondering what people think of Netsky's live show with the band. Honestly, I really didn't like it! In fact I'd go as far as to say I hated it. My reasons:

1) The formula of a band playing one song at a time with a break in between each one didn't seem compatible at all with Netsky's DnB. Of course I understand it's supposed to be a different experience to the usual DJ set, but that doesn't excuse it from not working.

2) The songs were terrible. I'm not a fan of Netsky 2. The only song I can really get in to is ""Drawing Straws"" but that wasn't played. I'm pretty sure the only songs he played that weren't on 2 were half of Black and Blue and half of Secret Agent. I'm aware that Netsky 2 was produced with the intention of it being more ""band friendly"" but again, that doesn't excuse them for sucking

3) The atmosphere. Although you could say this was more down to the crowd, I still believe the DJ is ultimately responsible. People were moshing to 90% of the tracks played, to the extent that the MC had to beg them not to mosh for one song. I absolutely love moshing - at the right time. But when you want to dance to Netsky, and everyone's moshing it kinda sucks.

That's the end of my rant. Had to get it out somewhere so why not over an internet message board! For the record I'm a huge fan of early Netsky classics and fully support a DJ going in ""new"" directions. I just think Netsky live is completely the wrong direction.

EDIT: spelling, and it was a show in Brighton on the 2nd December. It was +14 which probably didn't help. "	t5_2r11p	True

I've been listening to the DnB channel on Digitally Imported it's just all over the place and all too often plays crap that just makes me want to go to sleep.

1375960883.0	1jy6ta	Why hasn't DnB really evolved much lately?	TestingVariance33	53	12	71	"Between 1990 and 2000 hardcore/jungle/dnb was such a fresh and exciting scene because the music evolved so quickly. For each and every one of those years the music was distinctly, audibly different. This is demonstrably and obviously true if you listen to old mixes from that era.

**I'm not saying that there isn't currently good music being made**, but DnB no longer seems to push the boundaries of technology/music in the way it did previously. DnB used to pride itself on being the sound of the future / 'future music'. Why does this not seem like it is still the case? Is everyone ok just to make tunes that sound like everything else??

What has changed that has caused, in what I can hear, an almost complete stop to evolution?? It's like sometime around 2005ish everyone decided ""Right, this is it, we're ok with what we have!"" (drumstep/minamilst-Autonomic developments notwithstanding). Listen to most mixes from the last 5-10 years and it's pretty much the exact same spectrum of styles and beats.

Case in point: Virus Recordings. Have they been remixing the same tune over and over for the past 10 years? So ironic considering how forward-thinking Wormhole was deemed to be at the time. Or, Dillinja, anyone? It's absolutely incredible how far he has fallen since the mid 90s. although to be fair, Dillinja, Ed Rush/Optical et al really have nothing left to prove to anyone, but still, the quality drop is pretty sad. Hospital Records is another one. They seem to have nailed the liquid formula a good 10 years ago, but since then pumped out the same tune for hundreds of releases.

Again, I'm not saying there aren't good tunes out there, and I'm not saying that there aren't individual producers still pushing the boundaries, but if there are, this is not coming across in the average mix or radio show from recent times, which indicates to me that boundary-pushing producers are in the vast minority.

What has changed that has caused this?

1288234961.0	dxija	Listen to /r/dnb (and others) with Reddit Playlister!	pocketninja	45	5	40	"**TL;DR - I made a playlist thing for Reddit which makes listening to submitted music links super easy. You guys at /r/dnb are the first to have it. [Reddit Playlister. Go now!]( http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com)**

Yo!

This post is the release of a little project I’ve been building on/off over the last couple of weeks. It started off as something just for me which ran on a local host, but I thought that others might like it as well. 

**[Reddit Playlister!](http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com)**

Reddit Playlister is essentially a playlist style web page. You pick a Subreddit, load items, click play, and let it do its thing. It’ll auto-switch to the next item in the playlist, it’ll auto-load more items when it gets near the end of a playlist, etc, etc. 

It is loosely inspired by rplayer.co.uk, but whenever I wanted to use it Google would abuse me with ""over quota"" messages.

Despite supporting YouTube links, the videos themselves are never shown. This is a music focused web page. I ~~never~~ very rarely look at the visuals while listening to music on YouTube at work or at home. This is purely for music intent only. :) Set it going and leave it in the background. Honestly, do you watch YouTube videos while at work? (OK OK, so that question wasn’t entirely serious, but hopefully you catch my meaning)

**The main features**

    - Load items from a few selected subreddits, or type in your own
    - Two of the more common link types are supported:
        - YouTube
        - Soundcloud
    - Standard playlist/playback controls
        - Play/Pause/Stop/Next/Prev
        - Volume
        - Seek bar
    - Ability to change quality of YouTube links (defaults to HD720 for better audio quality)
    - Purdy CSS stuff (with low quality mode for unsupported/slow browsers)
    - Data fetching is performed by the user’s browser via YQL using jQuery
    - Functions in IE6/IE7/IE8/IE9, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera
        - !! May not look quite the same in IE6-8


If it’s useful to you, I hope you like it. Please let me know if you have any feedback, find problems, or have any ideas or anything like that.

Eventually, if there's enough interest, I might cross-post to other subreddits. Feel free to pass the link around if you want, though.

=)

HyphMngo	45	7	76	"I have been an unashamed champion of Hospital Records since discovering London Elektricity's Pull the Plug LP and High Contrast's Make It Tonight single back in 2001. I'd been spinning mostly jump up jungle cuts to this point (mostly Urban Takeover and True Playaz releases) and this label was like a breath of fresh air to my ears. 

Hospital has always been a label synonymous with quality fun releases; a label a DJ could rely on (especially when spinning to a more 'mainstream' audience). However, after the disappointment that was Yikes! (the remixes were alright), a few questionable singles and now The Agony &amp; The Ecstasy i'm left wondering if Hospital have lost the touch or whether this is just an indication of the state of the scene.

/r/dnb, you've been one of my favorite subs to keep coming back to over the past few years; I've been subscribed here since we were around 800 strong. Whenever I think /r/dnb was going to go mainstream here in the states, I'd always head back here to check the number, and it's only been on a steady climb thus far.

Keep it real guys. Here's my three faves, all picked up from this sub:

1353380391.0	13hl3r	Thoughts on recent discussions about heavy/early downvoting	wwwrun	50	14	27	"Hey /r/dnb'ers,

we have a lot of subscribers by now (just hit 18k) and also lots of traffic (by now up to 100.000 pageviews/month) in our beloved subreddit but a very small amount of up-/downvoting going on in relation to it. I don't know why the people use upvotes so sparingly on quality content but one thing is for sure - the downvotes in this subreddit have a relatively high voteweight. Lots of good stuff (including e.g. handcrafted mixes from the community members themselve) does not make it up front because it is crushed by one early downvote hammer, gets straight from the new queue into the dungeons of the unwanted posts and is more or less hidden forever. 

     -

I know it is difficult when it comes to discussing music and taste of music because there is so much emotion attached to it. Probably we all know the feeling at a rave when its not only the particular artist [insertyourmostfavouriteartisthere], but he is also playing [yourfavouritetunehere]!!!  Sickest tunes, sweat is dropping from the ceiling, the crowd is going crazy and you just think: This can't in any way get any better at all - can it? And then you come home, sleep for the rest of the morning, head to /r/dnb and submit your tune you remembered from last night thinking this is soo good it has to receive at least 100 upvotes from me alone. And then you get a single downvote a lot of the people don't see it at all and later you might even delete the post because you think *that* track has not deserved to vegetate in your submisson history with not a single upvote.

     -

And even only within this colourful subgenre we all got to know by now that tastes of our fellow /r/dnb crew diverges heavily. So if you didn't think that this is a reasonable comment/post at least try to explain why. This is a community - try to *discuss* things. And when you and your discussion partner realize that you come to the point that it's about individual taste - thats fine, too! Leave it like that, congrat each other on liking DnB, shake your virtual hands and go to the bar to get a drink. But the most important thing is that OPs shallow feeling of submitting OC and immediately getting downvotes and not knowing why is gone. And although the original post might not have received masses of upvotes, OP decides to post again in the future. And that is in the end what we all want to have here at best - a lot of fresh content.

     -

I love seeing - and this happens from time to time - that mediocre content gets early downvotes, but then someone steps up and writes a single (sometimes polarising) comment and then a wild discussion breaks loose, other people get attracted to it because of the sheer number of the comments and slowly but surely OPs post is getting more and more upvotes because the discussion alone which has developed meanwhile is actually *worth reading*. Somehow this works quite well with community-produces tracks by now.

     -

This is reddit with all its up- and downboat glory and, as stated earlier, I will not encourage any attempt to hide the downvote arrow via CSS like it was suggested from users before in similar discussions - I personally think that would be utterly wrong (and not only because you can circumvent it too easily).

     -

Sure, when its about non-dnb related content the mods can step in and can do something about it, i.e. delete meme posts or make infrequent picture submitters who don't know it yet aware of the fact that their submissions 'distort' the content/aim of this subreddit because these sometimes completely dnb unrelated posts attract masses of upvotes in a small amount of time, not only because we are conditioned to do so while quickly flicking through the frontpage of /r/pics or /r/funny. But in this case only you as a community can step in and react accordingly. We had the content-type related discussion here a lot and I think we as a community are handling it pretty well by now, now it's time to think about (step 2) *how you react* to dnb related content where youre brain tells you ""I clearly don't like it"" (step 1).

     -

This whole wall of text is not about any order or a mandatory rule but merely food for thought. A downvote is unconstructive criticism - try to be constructive. **Especially when it's the first downvote.**

     -

Thanks for listening and good night.

     -

**TL;DR** Think before you downvote a comment/post, express yourself, let the redditor know why and encourage discussion."	t5_2r11p	True

our biggest change we had since the last show - we are streaming now in parallel to edmradio.org (run by redditors from /r/edmradio) where you can tune in as well if you only want to enjoy the audio stream or if you e.g. have to rely on a slow internet connection! Our site will stay online of course providing the videostream as usual.

But more importantly: The plan for the future is to open up more as well and incorporate more of you reddit DnB DJs. Therefore /r/edmradio has made a huge step into your direction and dedicated the whole Sunday now to /r/dnb! That means there are a lot of 1+ hour slots to be filled before and after our show which is usually airing at 9pm UTC/GMT. Maybe we could start with someone from Australia, switch to the sunday sessions in Berlin later, have someone from London playing afterwards, before we come up with some US DJs? And Icecast broadcasting is really easy too, so head to edmradio.org and reserve yourself a slot for the next Sunday! Another option would be to contact the /r/edmradio mod /u/polyponic directly via a reddit message or in the #edmradio chat room - I bet he'll be gladly helping you out in any organizational matters. He approached us with the idea by the way - and was also the winner of the first /r/dnb MotM contest with a fantastic mix - remember? :P

Maybe someone of you noticed already - the /r/dnb FAQ is now transformed to the new Wiki-style format, and I bet we're coming up with a proper sunday sessions page in the future where all of us can take part in editing and organizing the upcoming Sundays.

Also a special slot will be reserved for the Mix of the Month winners - we'll keep you updated on this.

Another goodie: edmradio has an archive, so in the future you will be able to relisten to all our *and your* shows even when its not a Sunday! (recording &amp; minimal effort from your side required though, details on /r/edmradio)

Also, our chat is now merged on freenode on the channel #edmradio as well, the website is already updated since the last show so you only have to click on the LiveChat button and nothing really changes for you :)

And our video streaming server is by far not at it's planned load factor so tune in when it's that day of the week again :)

Last but not least - preview on the next session #12: More guests &amp; unreleased choons!

Stay tuned!

I've been wanting to make this list for a while and finally I'm gonna do it tonight cause I can't sleep. I've seen quite a few threads basically asking how to keep up with the DnB scene. I think one of the best ways to do this is by following DnB promotional channels. This is a list of some of the promotional channels that I've subscribed to over the past year. Keep in mind that I am excluding label channels and feel free to link to more channels in the comments and I'll add them to the list. 
Also it's 3am in the morning so cut me some slack if the formatting looks ugly.

I think it's time we got ours sorted out :D We're one of the bigger electronic music sub reddits now, so I hope this means we can get a lot of community participation to write the FAQ.

If you're interested here's how you take part. Head over to the /r/dnb part of the reddit wiki located here:

http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/dnb

and start editing. (it's really that simple)

I've started it off a little bit, but I'd love it if people with more knowledge of Drum &amp; Bass than me had at it :P

You can view the FAQ here: http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/dnb

I'm looking for any and all suggestions to improve the community around here. (not that I'm saying it's bad of course :P)

I was chatting to another redditor earlier, and he suggested getting people to post some really awesome DnB and compiling it all into a massive grooveshark playlist. I'm going to make a topic for that tomorrow but I'd like to wait for suggestions from other people first :)

1355264502.0	14otay	I don't know if any of you share the same disgust when you encounter an iTunes based podcast but I wrote something to let you easily get the proper feed that Apple like to hide..	sk3tch	43	9	6	"What I'm talking about is when record labels or artists link to their otherwise fantastic podcasts with a link which goes to Apple, like these examples:

* [Critical Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/critical-podcast/id293017397)
* [Shogun Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/shogun-audio-podcast/id349670447)
* [DnbArena Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/drum-bassarena-podcast/id110623324)

I realise a lot of them also link to their actual feed elsewhere, but a hell of lot of them also don't or make it impossible to find which is infuriating if you don't want to download iTunes just to listen to a freely streamable mp3/m4a file. So I made a javascript bookmarklet which talks to the same API the itunes store uses to get the actual URL you can actually use in your RSS readers/other podcast programs.

If you don't know what the fuck that means, it doesn't matter - it's super simple to install and use:

**To install**

* [Follow the instructions here](http://www.djm.org.uk/reveal-rss-feed-url-itunes-podcast/). I'd put them here but reddit doesn't allow javascript bookmark links for security reasons.

You should then be able to go to any iTunes podcast page, click the bookmarklet and wait a few seconds for it to get the actual URL for you 

e.g you'd get:

* http://www.criticalmusic.com/podcast/CriticalPodcast.xml
* http://www.shogunaudio.co.uk/Podcast/podcast.xml
* http://podcast.breakbeat.co.uk/

respectively for the above critical, shogun and dnbarena pages.

So I've been thinking of getting my boyfriend and I tickets to ""Lights All Night,"" and electronic music festival in Dallas, for my boyfriend's Xmas gift.

My boyfriend's favorite music genre is DnB, and most of the sub-genres.

His favorite artists are Pendulum, Feint, High Contrast, Netsky, Hybrid Minds, Rameses B, Fred V &amp; Grafix.

From what I have observed, he likes electronic music in general, but DnB is his favorite.

Info here: http://www.lightsallnight.com/index.php

Here's where I need help:

Is the type of music at this festival DnB; or, if my bf likes DnB would he like the music at this festival?

The tickets are expensive and I'd like to keep this a surprise...so I'd like someone's opinion as to whether this would be a good gift.


Thanks

##What, why, where

First of all: ***upvotes*** please. This needs to be noticed..

[Website](http://www.technologydnb.co.uk/cms/events/hidden-friday-04-nov-2011) // [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=176231629123517)

Raiden, 5 quid...need I say more. The last one at Scala was immense, I never did get round to posting the photos did I? One day.. for now here are a few official ones:

* [Dom &amp; Roland](http://i.imgur.com/QVuqv.jpg)
* [Spirit](http://i.imgur.com/c5mTE.jpg)
* [Me and StickyToffee](http://i.imgur.com/y10sO.jpg)
* [Me and random mentalist](http://i.imgur.com/kvotL.jpg) (and obakemono in the bg actually, hidden green one)
* [The rest](http://www.dogsonacid.com/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=335087)

And a little mix they've put up from that night: [Fathom Audio](http://www.technologydnb.co.uk/audioupload/scalasept/Fathom%20Audio%20-%20Technology%20@%20Scala%2016-09-11.mp3).

But anyway, **one of our own is playing in Room 2 so you have to come, them be the rules**. Listen to a [set of hers here](http://soundcloud.com/solstice-dj/solstice-moving-on).

It's down at the newly renovated Hidden club in Vauxhall which I've never been to but have heard good things about..a new place is always good.

****

##Room One Line-up

* RAIDEN (2HR SPECIAL)
* JUBEI (90 MIN SET)
* BAD COMPANY UK (CLASSICS SET)
* PROLIX B2B DOSE (90 MIN SET)
* BASHER B2B XTRAH
* with 2SHY MC, CODEBREAKER &amp; BLACKEYE

****

##Plan

Depending on people count we're going to meet at one of two pubs nearby, either [The Royal Oak](http://g.co/maps/x4n3s) or [The Rose](http://g.co/maps/h4ja6). Time will come at a later date but probably somewhere around 8pm. My numbers for those that might need it: oh seven 9 two 1 1 nine 1 four 6 three. If you text, say who it is 'cos otherwise it gets damn confusing! 

****

##Tickets

[Deftickets](http://tickets.deftickets.co.uk/checkout/view-event/id/1776/chk/cbd4) or [Ticketweb](http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/user/?region=gb_london&amp;query=detail&amp;event=472188). Deftickets is cheaper and how I got mine.

###UPDATE

This has come around so quickly..

We're going with [The Rose](http://www.therosepublondon.co.uk/location) because of the amount of people (fucking awesome I might add). There's a table booked for 9pm downstairs under the name of reddit, although I doubt she spelt that correctly. miss-solstice is playing at 3.30am in the morning; not sure about other set times yet or even when we'll head down - will just see how it goes I guess..

My number is oh 7 nine two one 1 nine 1 4 six three, will be there just before 9..

See you all there!

Although, the kind of tunes I was listening to back then were from late 90s (blue note era) to the emergence of liquid dnb like tunes such as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIlY0Q_y-5Y). Since then I've been following DnB closely, made some tunes which are being played by some big name DJs like Loxy, Amoss and Doc Scott.

Recently, I have no been feeling dnb at all. I went to my local record store like I do every month and all of it was just shit, bar one calyx and teebee track which is 7/10 at best.

I decided to take a look at the older stuff my record store has, and found some forgotten gems. Tunes like Silver blade by Dillinja and Dark Metal by Goldie.

Dunno if there is anyone else out there who is just not feeling the scene at the minute and sticking to the older tunes."	t5_2r11p	True

* Upvote as many entries per awards as you like.
* Only upvotes will be counted.
* Sorry for being a nazi but it took me bloody ages :p


[GO VOTE](/r/dnbawards2011)! 

Good luck to everyone; we had to drop one category because there were no nominations.

* VICIOUS CIRCLE
* SILENT WITNESS
* PROLIX
* FOREIGN CONCEPT

**and of course [miss-solstice](/user/miss-solstice) playing Room 2** sometime during the night :)

[Promo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOCP19A4cPo).

### The Venue

[Hidden Club](http://www.hiddenclub.co.uk/contact/) in Vauxhall under the Tinworth Street Railway Arch. Closest tube: Vauxhall (see note below).

###Tickets

Get tickets! This will probably sell out &amp; early bird is already gone. I think it'll be 11 quid now..
You can only buy tickets here: [DEFTICKETS](http://tickets.deftickets.co.uk/checkout/view-event/id/2262/chk/fa5e). If you don't have Paypal, you can just pay by card - just select 'Don't have paypal account' when you hit Paypal. Will be more on the door if they have any.

###Plan

I'll book a table at [The Rose](http://www.therosepublondon.co.uk/) from **9pm**, it's right opposite the club so then people can just go over early or stay for a bit of a drink, or whatever they feel like. My number is 0 seven 9 two one one 9 one four 6 3.

###My master plan to convince you to come

Pics from last time: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/m3fp5/rdnb_meetup_technology_vs_sudden_def_london_pics/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/comments/m2jvv/well_that_was_fun/).

###Trains

**NB**: The Victoria Line is ***closed*** Saturday and Sunday that weekend (i.e this won't affect Friday eve, just the morning). It's the only underground line that serves Vauxhall station but that's not really a big issue as it's also a National Rail station and Waterloo is one stop away. Also buses everywhere from the bus station for that wankered trek home.

You Generally listen to Drum &amp; Bass becasue it cheers you up, breaks up the boredom and keeps you awake.

Out of 12 Music groups (others being; Classic Rock, Indie Rock, Pop/Chart, Metal, RnB, Hip-hop, Dance, Classical, Jazz, Reggae or ""Other""), we:

- Have a 68% Likelihood of have driving offenses or have road rage. (Ranked 1st)
- 73% Likelihood to drive over the speed limit (Ranked 3rd, behind Metal and Indie)
- 38% Chance that you drive too close to the car in front. (Ranked 1st, just ahead of Hip-Hop)
- 66% Likelihood to loose your temper with other road users (Ranked 1st, closesly followed by Metal)
- Ranked 3rd most likely to give way at junctions, behind Classical and Classic Rock! (Surprising one)
- 3rd most likely to find it easier to concentrate at junctions when listening to DnB, behind Classical and Indie.
- 2nd most likely to cause arguements in the car by forcing everyone else to listen to Drum and Bass (Behind Hip-hop).
- 53% Likely to listen to ""The Pouges - Fairytale of New York"" in the car over the christmas period.
- 51% Chance to hate listening to ""Elton John - Step into Christmas"" and change the radio station.
- 72% Chance of ""Getting into the Christmas Spirit"" whilst listening to the radio in the car.

There's a load more but I got bored after a while.

The only groups that find driving more relaxing than us are Reggae, Jazz and R&amp;B, everyone else finds it much more stressful.

Back in 2001 I heard a DnB song that got me into the genre.  Unfortunately I've never heard it since and every now and again it pops back up in my memory and bugs the hell out of me.  The most distinctive thing I remember is the intro.  It had strings, like a violin or a cello, playing the melody for a short while and then the rest of the song hit.  Aaand that's all I got...

Like I said, needle in a haystack here but if you can think of anything that might resemble what i'm looking for, artist/title/album/whatever, post it! Cheers guys.

EDIT: 'g0_west' got me thinking, it wasn't a melodic dnb tune. Not chilled or in the liquiddnb mold.  Think it was more jungly.  Some of the older grime style dnb beats kind of ring a bell."	t5_2r11p	True

##The [masta plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-0elSJtSlo)

It's a Friday so anywhere we meet is going to be rammed (hilarious..I know) because of after work drinkers so I'm going to suggest [The Green](http://www.thegreenec1.co.uk/) because 1) it's easy to find (unless you're peterfile343) 2) it's close to the station &amp; fabric but far enough away to not be completely packed 3) you can stand/sit outside on the street and they don't bother you. Met Office says no rain Weds/Thurs so hopefully that'll stick out for Friday..

**URGENT UPDATE: Due to the recent unrest happening in and around London, fabric are complying with the police’s wishes and restricting attendance to this Friday’s RAM 100/FABRICLIVE event. The event will only be open to ticket holders and members. THERE WILL BE NO ENTRY FOR ANYONE WITHOUT A VALID TICKET OR MEMBERSHIP. Please note: All tickets will only be valid until 12am/midnight. There will be no entry after this time**

Get a ticket! I believe even +1's on the fabricfirst cards won't be getting in.

**Edit 2**: Tonight ladies n gents. Will be there latest by 7pm, my number is above! I suggest we leave the pub for or soon after ten because not getting in would be a terrible disaster. I'll be wearing a black t-shirt with a blue metalheadz skull logo (so you can spot me, I'm not boasting about my clothing :D).

When I started mixing in 2007 I used to drop my mixes into the dnb record shop run by local promoters to get feedback and maybe a chance to play - every time they'd say ""yeah you're on the right track, keep at it."" and I'd never hear anything more (fair enough to begin with but even after I knew what I was doing they were apathetic).

I moved to a new city for about 18 months a couple years back and the local scene there were much more warm and welcoming. They didn't care what your social status was, they just liked that I played their kind of music and so I got a few sets out in bars and on radio.

Since moving back I've had no luck, and just mix at private parties and for myself really. I put my mixes up online but my fanbase is ""modest"" lol.... until now!
I've been invited to play with my home city's local crew on their podcast, doing a guest set tomorrow night! I'm not sure if it'll be streamed live or just recorded but either way I'm stoked to have *finally* been given the opportunity to prove my worth around here and hopefully get noticed.

Just wanted to share the good news. I'm sure there are a lot of you in the same boat as me, confined to our bedrooms, itching for an audience. Wish me luck!

Oh and if you have any tips for how to break into a local scene as an unknown DJ then please, I'm all ears.

EDIT: Ok so it will be streamed live, audio and cam. Nervous as anything but I've got my tracklist sorted and tomorrow off work so I can rinse it all day and hopefully be a little more confident.

UPDATE: I just finished and played a great hour long set. Was nervous at first but soon got into it. I hope the recording came out well.  I'll put a link up once I get hold of it. Feeling fuckin awesome :)"	t5_2r11p	True

I want to know what Reddit feels is the best of this year.
As a side note, I am in Canada and truly the only DnB exposure I get is from Reddit.  It's pretty desolate over here in terms of DnB fans.

[Get tickets here on the Cable website](http://www.cable-london.com/event/get-darker2) - this will probably sell out, get them if you're coming.

Full line up including the dubstep side: 16Bit, Wilkinson, Coki, DJG, Calyx &amp; Teebee, Distance, Logistics, Nu:Tone, Silkie, Kromester B2B Dark Tantrums, Serum, Kasra, Foreign Concept, Von D, Darkside, DJ AMC.

I'm going to be posting this in /r/realdubstep to try and get a few of them along as well, spread the love 'n all that [but really convert them to the dark side ;)].

##THE PLAN

Meet at the [Horniman, London Bridge](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thehornimanathayslondonbridge/), 8.30pm on Friday. It's right on river front so if you head across the road after coming out at London Bridge find a side road that'll take you to the south bank path and it's right there. If you come through the Hay's Galleria (massive glass roofed arch building) it's on the right after you come out river side.

Chose this one cos it's on the river, has a proper outside bit and isn't the Shipwright's Arms where they were cunts to us last time about having a glass of tap water (with a proper drink! the wankers).

My number is oh 7 nine two 1 one nine 1 four 6 3, ring/text any time!

##PEOPLE

**IN**

* DarkMarvel
* die_troller
* haxonite
* meltphaced
* robot_scream
* ~~SeriousFaceUk~~ (too busy wanking)
* shoebox + mates.
* sketch

I'm not quite sure who else is in already, so please shout!

***MAYBE***

1335059618.0	sm2pl	How do you save a failing dancefloor?		33	8	54	"So i was playing a gig that is usually pretty open-minded with regard to the underground dnb (which is pretty much what my dnb collection comprises of), and is usually a place that you can easily get away with tunes ala Skeptical, Die &amp; Break, Spectrasoul, Enei, Amoss, DBR UK etc, but tonight the crowd just wasnt feeling it and i had to resort to some cheese and jump-up just to save the dancefloor. 

im feeling pretty crap about it tbh cuz usually the dancefloor is heaving, so i ask the question: how does r/dnb save a failing dancefloor? im an experienced DJ (4yrs+, UK based) but pretty new to mixing dnb, only been playing it for ~ 6 months, so any advice and tips will be much appreciated.

Also thought that he isn't notable, so article was deleted 5 years ago. It looks like somebody re-introduced it at some point, but then it was deleted again.

Interestingly, article is fairly good, and it's possible to add source just by linked to biography on allmusic: http://www.allmusic.com/artist/technical-itch-mn0000020464

Also it isn't  a problem to establish notability: link to allmusic, mention that he is on Animatrix soundtrack, etc.

Fav Tracks: 2999, Early Again, Sendai Song, Winter Ways, Arpeggio.

Overall: B-

A few good tracks but the alternative genre productions feel unpolished and rushed.  I like the variety, but just unmemorable aside from the few tracks I know I'll be cherry picking for the next few months."	t5_2r11p	True
